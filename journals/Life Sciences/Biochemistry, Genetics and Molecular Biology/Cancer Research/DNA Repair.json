     "abstract": "Evidence indicates that the age-related neuropathological mechanisms associated with DNA repair genes may contribute to cognitive aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. In this study, we hypothesize that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within 155 DNA repair genes may be linked to cognitive aging independently and/or through complex interactions in an older Taiwanese population. A total of 3,730 Taiwanese subjects aged over 60 years from the Taiwan Biobank were analyzed. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was administered to all subjects, and MMSE scores were used to measure cognitive functions. Our data showed that out of 1,652 SNPs, the rs1776181 (P\u2009=\u20091.47\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22125), rs1776177 (P\u2009=\u20098.42\u2009\u00d7\u200910-7), rs1635510 (P\u2009=\u20097.97\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6), and rs2526698 (P\u2009=\u20097.06\u2009\u00d7\u200910-6) SNPs in the EXO1 gene were associated with cognitive aging. The association with these SNP remained significant after performing Bonferroni correction. Additionally, we found that interactions between the EXO1 and RAD51C genes influenced cognitive aging (P\u2009=\u20090.002). Finally, we pinpointed the influence of interactions between EXO1 and physical activity (P\u2009<\u20090.001) as well as between DCLRE1C and physical activity (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Our study indicated that DNA repair genes may contribute to susceptibility in cognitive aging independently as well as through gene-gene and gene-physical interactions.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species generated in the process of energy production represent a major cause of oxidative DNA damage. Production of the oxidized guanine base, 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG), results in mismatched pairing with adenine and subsequently leads to G:C to T:A transversions after DNA replication. Our previous study demonstrated that Drosophila CG1795 encodes an ortholog of Ogg1, which is essential for the elimination of 8-oxoG. Moreover, the Drosophila ribosomal protein S3 (RpS3) possesses N-glycosylase activity that eliminates 8-oxoG in vitro. In this study, we show that RpS3 heterozygotes hyper-accumulate 8-oxoG in midgut cell nuclei after oxidant feeding, suggesting thatRpS3 is required for the elimination of 8-oxoG in Drosophila adults. We further showed that several muscle-aging phenotypes were significantly accelerated in RpS3 heterozygotes. Ogg1 is localized in the nucleus, while RpS3 is in the cytoplasm, closely associated with endoplasmic reticulum networks. Results of genetic analyses also suggest that these two proteins operate similarly but independently in the elimination of oxidized guanine bases from genomic DNA. Next, we obtained genetic evidence suggesting that CG42813 functions as the Drosophila ortholog of mammalian Mth1 in the elimination of oxidized dGTP (8-oxo-dGTP) from the nucleotide pool. Depletion of this gene significantly increased the number of DNA damage foci in the nuclei of Drosophila midgut cells. Furthermore, several aging-related phenotypes such as age-dependent loss of adult locomotor activities and accumulation of polyubiquitylated proteins in adult muscles were also significantly accelerated in CG42813-depleted flies. Lastly, we investigated the phenotype of adults depleted of CG9272, which encodes a protein with homology to mammalian Nth1 that is essential for the elimination of oxidized thymine. Excessive accumulation of oxidized bases was observed in the epithelial cell nuclei after oxidant feeding. In conclusion, three genes that prevent accumulation of oxidative DNA damage were identified in Drosophila.",

     "abstract": "Bacterial RarA is thought to play crucial roles in the cellular response to blocked replication forks. We show that lack of Bacillus subtilis RarA renders cells very sensitive to H2O2, but not to methyl methane sulfonate or 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. RarA is epistatic to RecA in response to DNA damage. Inactivation of rarA partially suppressed the DNA repair defect of mutants lacking translesion synthesis polymerases. RarA may contribute to error-prone DNA repair as judged by the reduced frequency of rifampicin-resistant mutants in \u0394rarA and in \u0394polY1 \u0394rarA cells. The absence of RarA strongly reduced the viability of dnaD23ts and dnaB37ts cells upon partial thermal inactivation, suggesting that \u0394rarA cells are deficient in replication fork assembly. A \u0394rarA mutation also partially reduced the viability of dnaC30ts and dnaX51ts cells and slightly improved the viability of dnaG40ts cells at semi-permissive temperature. These results suggest that RarA links re-initiation of DNA replication with repair-by-recombination by controlling the access of the replication machinery to a collapsed replication fork.",

     "abstract": "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are a severe threat to genome integrity and a potential cause of tumorigenesis, which is a multi-stage process and involves many factors including the mutation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, some of which are transcribed microRNAs (miRNAs). Among more than 2000 known miRNAs, miR-21 is a unique onco-miRNA that is highly expressed in almost all types of human tumors and is associated with tumorigenesis through its multiple targets. However, it remains unclear whether there is any functional link between DSBs and miR-21 expression and, if so, does the link contribute to DSB-induced genomic instability/tumorigenesis. To address this question, we used DNA-PKcs-/- (deficient in non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)) and Rad54-/- (deficient in homologous recombination repair (HRR)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) since NHEJ and HRR are the major pathways for DSB repair in mammalian cells. Our results indicate that levels of miR-21 are elevated in these DSB repair (DSBR) deficient cells, and ionizing radiation (IR) further increases these levels in both wild-type (WT) and DSBR-deficient cells. Interestingly, IR stimulated growth in soft agar and this effect was greatly reduced by blocking miR-21 expression in both WT and DSBR-deficient cells. Taken together, our results suggest that either IR or DSBR-deficient can lead to an upregulation of miR-21 levels and that miR-21 is associated with IR-induced cell growth in soft agar. These results may help our understanding of DSB-induced tumorigenesis and provide information that could facilitate the development of new strategies to prevent DSB-induced carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Endonuclease III (EndoIII) is a bifunctional DNA glycosylase that removes oxidized pyrimidines from DNA. The genome of Deinococcus radiodurans encodes for an unusually high number of DNA glycosylases, including three EndoIII enzymes (drEndoIII1-3). Here, we compare the properties of these enzymes to those of their well-studied homologues from E. coli and human. Our biochemical and mutational data, reinforced by MD simulations of EndoIII-DNA complexes, reveal that drEndoIII2 exhibits a broad substrate specificity and a catalytic efficiency surpassing that of its counterparts. In contrast, drEndoIII1 has much weaker and uncoupled DNA glycosylase and AP-lyase activities, a characteristic feature of eukaryotic DNA glycosylases, and was found to present a relatively robust activity on single-stranded DNA substrates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an activity for an EndoIII. In the case of drEndoIII3, no catalytic activity could be detected, but its ability to specifically recognize lesion-containing DNA using a largely rearranged substrate binding pocket suggests that it may play an alternative role in genome maintenance. Overall, these findings reveal that D. radiodurans possesses a unique set of DNA repair enzymes, including three non-redundant EndoIII variants with distinct properties and complementary activities, which together contribute to genome maintenance in this bacterium.",

     "abstract": "Increasing evidence supports the role of genetic and epigenetic alterations in a wide variety of human diseases, including cancer. Assessment of these alterations is hence essential for estimating the hazardous effects of human exposure to medications. Panobinostat received US Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval in 2015 for treatment of certain tumors and its usefulness as part of a strategy to treat other diseases, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, is currently investigated. Nevertheless, no data on in vivo genotoxical and epigenotoxical effects of panobinostat are available. The aim of the current study was to assess the genotoxical and epigenotoxical properties of panobinostat in murine bone marrow cells. Molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations were also evaluated. We show that mice treated with panobinostat doses recommended for human developed numerical chromosomal abnormalities, structural chromosomal damage, oxidative DNA damage, and DNA hypomethylation. These effects were dose-dependent. Further, panobinostat altered the expression of 23 genes implicated in DNA damage, as determined by RT\u00b2 Profiler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array, and confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting. Collectively, these findings indicate that panobinostat exposure induces aneugenicity, clastogenicity, oxidative DNA damage, DNA hypomethylation, and down-regulation of repair gene expression, which may be responsible for panobinostat-induced genotoxical and epigenotoxical effects. Considering the potential toxicity of panobinostat, the medicinal use of panobinostat must be weighed against the risk of tumorigenesis and the demonstrated toxicity profile of panobinostat may support further development of chemotherapeutic treatments with reduced toxicity. Diminishing the metabolic liabilities associated with panobinostat exposure, and simultaneous use of panobinostat with DNA repair enhancers, are examples of strategies for drug design to reduce panobinostat carcinogenicity.",

However, the effect of 6mA on human DNA replication remain elusive. In this work, we used Y-family human DNA polymerase \u03b7 as a model to investigate the kinetics of bypass of 6mA by hPol \u03b7. We found 6mA and its intermediate hypoxanthine (I) on template partially inhibited DNA replication by hPol \u03b7. dTMP incorporation opposite 6mA and dCMP incorporation opposite I can be considered as correct incorporation. However, both 6mA and I reduced correct incorporation efficiency, next-base extension efficiency, and the priority in extension beyond correct base pair. Both dTMP incorporation opposite 6mA and dCTP opposite I showed fast burst phases. However, 6mA and I reduced the burst incorporation rates (kpol) and increased the dissociation constant (Kd,dNTP), compared with that of dTMP incorporation opposite unmodified A. Biophysical binding assays revealed that both 6mA and I on template reduced the binding affinity of hPol \u03b7 to DNA in binary or ternary complex compared with unmodified A. All the results explain the inhibition effects of 6mA and I on DNA replication by hPol \u03b7, providing new insight in the effects of epigenetically modified 6mA on human DNA replication.",

     "abstract": "DNA replication stress, defined as the slowing or stalling of replication forks, is considered an emerging hallmark of cancer and a major contributor to genomic instability associated with tumorigenesis (Macheret and Halazonetis, 2015). Recent advances have been made in attempting to target DNA repair factors involved in alleviating replication stress to potentiate genotoxic treatments. Various inhibitors of ATR and Chk1, the two major kinases involved in the intra-S-phase checkpoint, are currently in Phase I and II clinical trials [2]. In addition, currently approved inhibitors of Poly-ADP Ribose Polymerase (PARP) show synthetic lethality in cells that lack double-strand break repair such as in BRCA1/2 deficient tumors [3]. These drugs have also been shown to exacerbate replication stress by creating a DNA-protein crosslink, termed PARP \u2018trapping\u2019, and this is now thought to contribute to the therapeutic efficacy. Translesion synthesis (TLS) is a mechanism whereby special repair DNA polymerases accommodate and tolerate various DNA lesions to allow for damage bypass and continuation of DNA replication (Yang and Gao, 2018). This class of proteins is best characterized by the Y-family, encompassing DNA polymerases (Pols) Kappa, Eta, Iota, and Rev1. While best studied for their ability to bypass physical lesions on the DNA, there is accumulating evidence for these proteins in coping with various natural replication fork barriers and alleviating replication stress. In this mini-review, we will highlight some of these recent advances, and discuss why targeting the TLS pathway may be a mechanism of enhancing cancer-associated replication stress. Exacerbation of replication stress can lead to increased genome instability, which can be toxic to cancer cells and represent a therapeutic vulnerability.",

     "abstract": "An important role for the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway in maintaining genomic stability is embodied in its conservation through evolution and the link between loss of MMR function and tumorigenesis. The latter is evident as inheritance of mutations within the major MMR genes give rise to the cancer predisposition condition, Lynch syndrome. Nonetheless, how MMR loss contributes to tumorigenesis is not completely understood. In addition to preventing the accumulation of mutations, MMR also directs cellular responses, such as cell cycle checkpoint or apoptosis activation, to different forms of DNA damage. Understanding this MMR-dependent DNA damage response may provide insight into the full tumor suppressing capabilities of the MMR pathway. Here, we delve into the proposed mechanisms for the MMR-dependent response to DNA damaging agents. We discuss how these pre-clinical findings extend to the clinical treatment of cancers, emphasizing MMR status as a crucial variable in selection of chemotherapeutic regimens. Also, we discuss how loss of the MMR-dependent damage response could promote tumorigenesis via the establishment of a survival advantage to endogenous levels of stress in MMR-deficient cells.",

     "abstract": "Genomic instability is implicated in the etiology of several deleterious health outcomes including megaloblastic anemia, neural tube defects, and neurodegeneration. Uracil misincorporation and its repair are known to cause genomic instability by inducing DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis, but there is emerging evidence that uracil incorporation may also result in broader modifications of gene expression, including: changes in transcriptional stalling, strand break-mediated transcriptional upregulation, and direct promoter inhibition. The factors that influence uracil levels in DNA are cytosine deamination, de novo thymidylate (dTMP) biosynthesis, salvage dTMP biosynthesis, dUTPase, and DNA repair. There is evidence that the nuclear localization of the enzymes in these pathways in mammalian cells may modify and/or control the levels of uracil accumulation into nuclear DNA. Uracil sequencing technologies demonstrate that uracil in DNA is not distributed stochastically across the genome, but instead shows patterns of enrichment. Nuclear localization of the enzymes that modify uracil in DNA may serve to change these patterns of enrichment in a tissue-specific manner, and thereby signal the genome in response to metabolic and/or nutritional state of the cell.",

We have recently shown that FANCA also plays an important role in the single-strand annealing sub-pathway (SSA) of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by biochemically catalyzing single-strand annealing. Here, we report that a steroidal lactone withaferin A (WA) specifically impedes SSA repair by promoting FANCA downregulation at a sub-micromolar concentration range. We find that WA causes FANCA downregulation post-translationally in a proteasome-dependent manner. This WA-mediated downregulation is achieved through HSP90 inhibition and disruption of the FANCA-HSP90 interaction. WA-mediated FANCA degradation significantly reduces cellular SSA repair, abolishes FANCD2 monoubiquitination, elevates sensitivity to mitomycin C, and results in accumulation of DSBs. Importantly, the WA-induced defect in SSA repair is highly dependent on the absence of FANCA protein and overexpression of exogenous WT-FANCA protein in WA-treated cells significantly complements the repair defect.",

RadA/Sms mutants in the conserved H1 (K104A and K104R) or KNRFG (K255A and K255R) motifs fail to rescue the sensitivity of \u0394radA in response to the four different DNA damaging agents. A RadA/Sms H1 or KNRFG mutation impairs both chromosomal and plasmid transformation, but the latter defect was suppressed by inactivating RecA. RadA/Sms K255A, K255R and wild type RadA/Sms reduced the diadenylate cyclase activity of DisA, whereas RadA/Sms K104A and K104R blocked it. Single-stranded and Holliday junction DNA are preferentially bound over double-stranded DNA by RadA/Sms and its variants. Moreover, RadA/Sms ATPase activity was neither stimulated by a variety of DNA substrates nor by DisA. RadA/Sms possesses a 5\u00b4\u21923\u00b4 DNA helicase activity. The RadA/Sms mutants neither hydrolyze ATP nor unwind DNA. Thus, we propose that RadA/Sms has two activities: to modulate DisA and to promote RecA-mediated DNA strand exchange.

Here, the alkaline comet assay was now optimized for easy and time saving detection of repair capacity upon oxidative stress-induced DNA damage using the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin (APC) to block repair of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced DNA damage. Addition of a DMSO-containing DNA damage stop solution was found suitable to replace washing steps for H2O2 removal before APC block. Cell treatment with APC at 6 \u03bcM did not impact baseline DNA damage but could reliably block DNA repair after H2O2 challenge in both fresh and cryopreserved samples thus omitting the use of a starting time point control. Under the conditions used, frozen cells, with or without an additional 4\u2009h rest, showed the same repair capacity as their fresh counterpart. The intra assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 3.3%. To provide proof of principle, the modified assay was applied to cryopreserved PBMC from 19 participants of a short-term Brassica diet intervention study investigating potential health promoting effects of the food intervention. Then, a 33% increase in DRC (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.01) could be shown in samples after intervention (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 5.82\u2009\u00b1\u20091) as compared to baseline (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD: 4.38\u2009\u00b1\u20091.21). Individual samples from baseline and intervention showed an inter-individual CV of 27.65% (baseline) and 17.26% (intervention).

Like most primases and polymerases, PrimPol requires divalent metal cations, as Mg2+ or Mn2+, used as cofactors for catalysis. However, little is known about the consequences of using these two metal cofactors in combination, which would be the most physiological scenario during PrimPol-mediated reactions, and the individual contribution of the putative carboxylate residues (Asp114, Glu116 and Asp280) acting as metal ligands. By site-directed mutagenesis in human PrimPol, we confirmed the catalytic relevance of these three carboxylates, and identified Glu116 as a relevant enhancer of distinctive PrimPol reactions, which are highly dependent on Mn2+. Herein, we evidenced that PrimPol Glu116 contributes to error-prone tolerance of 8oxodG more markedly when both Mg2+ and Mn2+ ions are present. Moreover, Glu116 was important for TLS events mediated by primer/template realignments, and crucial to achieving an optimal primase activity, processes in which Mn2+ is largely preferred. EMSA analysis of PrimPol:ssDNA:dNTP pre-ternary complex indicated a critical role of each metal ligand, and a significant impairment when Glu116 was changed to a more conventional aspartate. These data suggest that PrimPol active site requires a specific motif A (DxE) to favor the use of Mn2+ ions in order to achieve optimal incoming nucleotide stabilization, especially required during primer synthesis.",

By contrast, Spo11-dependent DSBs formed during meiosis are aimed at generating genetic diversity. In eukaryotes, CtIP and the Mre11 nuclease complex are essential for accurate processing and repair of both unscheduled and programmed DSBs by homologous recombination (HR). Here, we applied bioinformatics and genetic analysis to identify Paramecium tetraurelia CtIP (PtCtIP), the smallest known Sae2/Ctp1/CtIP ortholog, as a key factor for the completion of meiosis and the recovery of viable sexual progeny. Using in vitro assays, we find that purified recombinant PtCtIP preferentially binds to double-stranded DNA substrates but does not contain intrinsic nuclease activity. Moreover, mutation of the evolutionarily conserved C-terminal 'RHR' motif abrogates DNA binding of PtCtIP but not its ability to functionally interact with Mre11. Translating our findings into mammalian cells, we provide evidence that disruption of the 'RHR' motif abrogates accumulation of human CtIP at sites of DSBs. Consequently, cells expressing the DNA binding mutant CtIPR837A/R839A are defective in DSB resection and HR. Collectively, our work highlights minimal structural requirements for CtIP protein family members to facilitate the processing of DSBs, thereby maintaining genome stability as well as enabling sexual reproduction.",

     "abstract": "Unlike normal tissues, tumor cells possess a propensity for genomic instability, resulting from elevated oxidant levels produced by oncogenic signaling and aberrant cellular metabolism. Thus, targeting mechanisms that protect cancer cells from the tumor-inhibitory consequences of their redox imbalance and spontaneous DNA-damaging events is expected to have broad-spectrum efficacy and a high therapeutic index. One critical mechanism for tumor cell protection from oxidant stress is the hydrolysis of oxidized nucleotides. Human MutT homolog 1 (MTH1), the mammalian nudix (nucleoside diphosphate X) pyrophosphatase (NUDT1), protects tumor cells from oxidative stress-induced genomic DNA damage by cleansing the nucleotide pool of oxidized purine nucleotides. Depletion or pharmacologic inhibition of MTH1 results in genomic DNA strand breaks in many cancer cells. However, the mechanisms underlying how oxidized nucleotides, thought mainly to be mutagenic rather than genotoxic, induce DNA strand breaks are largely unknown. Given the recent therapeutic interest in targeting MTH1, a better understanding of such mechanisms is crucial to its successful translation into the clinic and in identifying the molecular contexts under which its inhibition is likely to be beneficial. Here we provide a comprehensive perspective on MTH1 function and its importance in protecting genome integrity, in the context of tumor-associated oxidative stress and the mechanisms that likely lead to irreparable DNA strand breaks as a result of MTH1 inhibition.",

     "abstract": "Chronic dietary exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), concomitant with hepatitis B infection is associated with a significant increased risk for hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in people living in Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Human exposures to AFB1 occur through the consumption of foods that are contaminated with pervasive molds, including Aspergillus flavus. Even though dietary exposures to aflatoxins constitute the second largest global environmental risk factor for cancer development, there are still significant questions concerning the molecular mechanisms driving carcinogenesis and what factors may modulate an individual\u2019s risk for HCC. The objective of this review is to summarize key discoveries that established the association of chronic inflammation (most commonly associated with hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection) and environmental exposures to aflatoxin with increased HCC risk. Special emphasis will be given to recent investigations that have: 1) refined the aflatoxin-associated mutagenic signature, 2) expanded the DNA repair mechanisms that limit mutagenesis via adduct removal prior to replication-induced mutagenesis, 3) implicated a specific DNA polymerase in the error-prone bypass and resulting mutagenesis, and 4) identified human polymorphic variants that may modulate individual susceptibility to aflatoxin-induced cancers. Collectively, these investigations revealed that specific sequence contexts are differentially resistant against, or prone to, aflatoxin-induced mutagenesis and that these associations are remarkably similar between in vitro and in vivo analyses. These recent investigations also established DNA polymerase \u03b6 as the major polymerase that confers the G to T transversion signature. Additionally, although the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway has been previously shown to repair aflatoxin-induced DNA adducts, recent murine data demonstrated that NEIL1-initiated base excision repair was significantly more important than NER relative to the removal of the highly mutagenic AFB1-Fapy-dG adducts. These data suggest that inactivating polymorphic variants of NEIL1 could be a potential driver of HCCs in aflatoxin-exposed populations.",

Both pathways appear to be involved in the repair of small base lesions such as uracil, abasic sites and oxidized bases. In addition to DNA polymerase \u03b2 (Pol\u03b2) as the main BER enzyme for repair synthesis, there is evidence for a minor role for DNA polymerase lambda (Pol\u03bb) in BER. In this study we explore the potential contribution of Pol\u03bb to both SP- and LP-BER in cell-free extracts. We measured BER activity in extracts of mouse embryonic fibroblasts using substrates with either a single uracil or the chemically stable abasic site analog tetrahydrofuran residue. The addition of purified Pol\u03bb complemented the pronounced BER deficiency of POLB-null cell extracts as efficiently as did Pol\u03b2 itself. We have developed a new approach for determining the relative contributions of SP- and LP-BER pathways, exploiting mass-labeled nucleotides to distinguish single- and multinucleotide repair patches. Using this method, we found that uracil repair in wild-type and in Pol\u03b2-deficient cell extracts supplemented with Pol\u03bb was \u223c80% SP-BER. The results show that recombinant Pol\u03bb can contribute to both SP- and LP-BER. However, endogenous Pol\u03bb, which is present at a level \u02dc50% that of Pol\u03b2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, appears to make little contribution to BER in extracts. Thus Pol\u03bb in cells appears to be under some constraint, perhaps sequestered in a complex with other proteins, or post-translationally modified in a way that limits its ability to participate effectively in BER.",

Our results suggest that the length and quality of microhomology influence both the overall efficiency of repair and the involvement of DNA polymerases. Furthermore, the non-essential DNA polymerases demonstrate overlapping and redundant functions when repairing double-strand breaks using short microhomologies containing mismatches. Then, we examined genome-wide mutation accumulation in the pol4\u0394 rev1\u0394 rev3\u0394 rad30\u0394 quadruple mutant compared to wild type cells. We found a significant decrease in the overall rate of mutation accumulation in the quadruple mutant cells compared to wildtype, but an increase in frameshift mutations and a shift towards transversion base-substitution with a preference for G:C to T:A or C:G.

Base excision repair (BER) is one of the most important pathways for the repair of DNA base lesions. Analysis of the E. histolytica genome revealed the presence of most of the BER components. Surprisingly, this included a gene encoding an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease that previous studies had assumed was absent. Indeed, our analysis showed that the genome of E. histolytica harbors the necessary genes needed for both short and long-patch BER sub-pathways. These genes include DNA polymerases with predicted 5\u2032-dRP lyase and strand-displacement activities and a sole DNA ligase. A distinct feature of the E. histolytica genome is the lack of several key damage-specific BER glycosylases, such as OGG1/MutM, MDB4, Mag1, MPG, SMUG, and TDG. Our evolutionary analysis indicates that several E. histolytica DNA glycosylases were acquired by lateral gene transfer (LGT). The genes that encode for MutY, AlkD, and UDG (Family VI) are included among these cases. Endonuclease III and UNG (family I) are the only DNA glycosylases with a eukaryotic origin in E. histolytica. A gene encoding a MutT 8-oxodGTPase was also identified that was acquired by LGT. The mixed composition of BER genes as a DNA metabolic pathway shaped by LGT in E. histolytica indicates that LGT plays a major role in the evolution of this eukaryote. Sequence and structural prediction of E. histolytica DNA glycosylases, as well as MutT, suggest that the E. histolytica DNA repair proteins evolved to harbor structural modifications that may confer unique biochemical features needed for the biology of this parasite.",

Significantly, the human and mouse neonatal brain is radiosusceptible.Here, we examine the response of stem and progenitor cells in the SVZ to low IR doses (50\u2013500\u2009mGy). We observe a linear dose-response for apoptosis but, in contrast, proliferation arrest and neuroblast differentiation require a threshold dose of 200 or 500\u2009mGy, respectively.

Recent studies using cancer genome sequencing, mutational signature analyses, yeast and mouse models, and the influence of mismatch repair on tumors with DNA polymerase mutations are discussed.",

An increase in RONS can saturate the antioxidation system and leads to oxidative stress. Consequently, macromolecules are targeted for oxidative modifications, including DNA and protein. The oxidation of DNA, which leads to base modification and formation of abasic sites along with single and double strand breaks, has been extensively investigated. Protein oxidation is often neglected and is only recently being recognized as an important regulatory mechanism of various DNA repair proteins. This is a review of the current state of research on the regulation of DNA repair by protein oxidation with emphasis on the correlation between inflammation and cancer.",

     "abstract": "DNA damage response (DDR) serves as an integrated cellular network to detect cellular stress and react by activating pathways responsible for halting cell cycle progression, stimulating DNA damage repair, and initiating apoptosis. Efficient DDR protects cells from genomic instability while defective DDR can allow DNA lesions to go unrepaired, causing permanent mutations that will affect future generations of cells and possibly cause disease conditions such as cancer. Therefore, DDR mechanisms must be tightly regulated in order to ensure organismal health and viability. One major way of DDR regulation is ubiquitination, which has been long known to control DDR protein localization, activity, and stability. The reversal of this process, deubiquitination, has more recently come to the forefront of DDR research as an important new angle in ubiquitin-mediated regulation of DDR. As such, deubiquitinases have emerged as key factors in DDR. Importantly, deubiquitinases are attractive small-molecule drug targets due to their well-defined catalytic residues that provide a promising avenue for developing new cancer therapeutics. This review focuses on the emerging roles of deubiquitinases in various DNA repair pathways.",

     "abstract": "Thymine deprivation in thyA mutant E. coli causes thymineless death (TLD) and is the mode of action of popular antibacterial and anticancer drugs, yet the mechanisms of TLD are still unclear. TLD comprises three defined phases: resistance, rapid exponential death (RED) and survival, with the nature of the resistance phase and of the transition to the RED phase holding key to TLD pathology. We propose that a limited source of endogenous thymine maintains replication forks through the resistance phase. When this source ends, forks undergo futile break-repair cycle during the RED phase, eventually rendering the chromosome non-functional. Two obvious sources of the endogenous thymine are degradation of broken chromosomal DNA and recruitment of thymine from stable RNA. However, mutants that cannot degrade broken chromosomal DNA or lack ribo-thymine, instead of shortening the resistance phase, deepen the RED phase, meaning that only a small fraction of T-starved cells tap into these sources. Interestingly, the substantial chromosomal DNA accumulation during the resistance phase is negated during the RED phase, suggesting futile cycle of incorporation and excision of wrong nucleotides. We tested incorporation of dU or rU, finding some evidence for both, but DNA-dU incorporation accelerates TLD only when intracellular [dUTP] is increased by the dut mutation. In the dut ung mutant, with increased DNA-dU incorporation and no DNA-dU excision, replication is in fact rescued even without dT, but TLD still occurs, suggesting different mechanisms. Finally, we found that continuous DNA synthesis during thymine starvation makes chromosomal DNA increasingly single-stranded, and even the dut ung defect does not completely block this ss-gap accumulation. We propose that instability of single-strand gaps underlies the pathology of thymine starvation.",

The hypomorphic mutation caused hypersensitivity of C. elegans germ cells to double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). Although the formation of RAD-51 foci at DSBs was normal in both the mutant and knockdown worms, their subsequent dissipation was slow. The rad-54-deficient phenotypes were greatly aggravated when combined with an xpf-1 mutation, suggesting a conservative role of single-strand annealing (SSA) for DSB repair in HR-defective worms. The phenotypes of doubly-deficient rad-54;xpf-1 worms were partially suppressed by a mutation of lig-4, a nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) factor. In summary, RAD-54 is required for the dissociation of RAD-51 from DSB sites in C. elegans germ cells.

MutS1 recognizes mismatched DNA and stimulates the nicking endonuclease activity of MutL to incise mismatch-containing DNA. In archaea, there has been no experimental evidence to support the existence of the MutS1/MutL-dependent MMR. Instead, it was revealed that a large part of archaea possess mismatch-specific endonuclease EndoMS, indicating that the EndoMS-dependent MMR is widely adopted in archaea. However, some archaeal genomes encode MutS1 and MutL homologs, and their molecular functions have not been revealed. In this study, we purified and characterized recombinant MutS1 and the C-terminal endonuclease domain of MutL from a methanogenic archaeon Methanosaeta thermophila (mtMutS1 and the mtMutL CTD, respectively). mtMutS1 bound to mismatched DNAs with a higher affinity than to perfectly-matched and other structured DNAs, which resembles the DNA-binding specificities of eukaryotic and bacterial MutS1 homologs. The mtMutL CTD showed a Mn2+/Ni2+/Co2+-dependent nicking endonuclease activity that introduces single-strand breaks into a circular double-stranded DNA. The nicking endonuclease activity of the mtMutL CTD was impaired by mutagenizing the metal-binding motif that is identical to those of eukaryotic and bacterial MutL endonucleases. These results raise the possibility that not only the EndoMS-dependent MMR but also the traditional MutS1/MutL-dependent MMR exist in archaea.",

     "abstract": "Compelling evidence suggest that germs cells are predominantly sensitive to DNA damaging agents in comparison to other cells. High fidelity DNA repair in testicular cells thus becomes indispensable to preserve the genomic integrity for passing on to the progeny. Compromised DNA repair machinery in the testicular cells may result in impaired spermatogenesis and infertility. It remains unclear if the alterations in the expression of DNA repair genes correlate with azoospermia and male infertility. In the present study, 54 non-obstructive azoospermic infertile patients with hypospermatogenesis (HS, n\u2009=\u200926), maturation arrest (MA, n\u2009=\u200915), Sertoli cell only syndrome (SCOS, n\u2009=\u200913) and 14 controls with obstructive azoospermia, but normal spermatogenesis were recruited. Expression profiling of 84 DNA repair genes in testicular biopsy samples was performed using PCR array. Out of 84 genes, 27, 64 and 28 genes showed >5 fold down-regulation in the HS, MA and SCOS groups, respectively. On the basis of differential expression and their functional significance in spermatogenesis, ten genes (MSH2, BRIP1, CCNH, LIG4, MGMT, NTHL1, PMS1, DMC1, POLB and XPA) were selected for validation of transcript levels in a higher number of cases using RT-PCR, which corroborated the findings of array. Four genes (MSH2, LIG4, PMS1 and DMC1) were analyzed for protein levels using immunohistochemistry, which further validated the loss of DNA repair gene expression. Caspase-3 immunostaining showed that the loss of DNA repair correlated with increased testicular apoptosis in patients. Maturation arrest showed the highest apoptotic index with maximum number of downregulated genes. We conclude that the loss of DNA repair genes expression in testis correlates with increased apoptosis, azoospermia and infertility.",

Mounting evidence points to the predictive and prognostic value of PARP1 expression in human cancers. Thus, PARP1 has become an important target in cancer therapy, leading to the development of inhibitors as anticancer drugs. In the past, PARP1 expression levels in tissue samples have generally been estimated by indirect and semi-quantitative immunohistochemical methods. Accurate measurement of PARP1 in normal tissues and malignant tumors of patients will be essential for evaluating PARP1 as a predictive and prognostic biomarker in cancer and other diseases, and for the development and use of its inhibitors in cancer therapy. In this work, we present an approach involving liquid chromatography\u2013isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry to positively identify and accurately quantify PARP1 in human tissues and cultured cells. We identified and quantified PARP1 in human normal ovarian tissues and malignant ovarian tumors, and in three pairs of human cell lines, each pair consisting of a normal cell line and its cancerous counterpart. Significantly greater expression of PARP1 was observed in malignant ovarian tissues than in normal ovarian tissues. In the case of one pair of cell lines, the cancerous cell line also exhibited greater expression of PARP1 than in normal cell line. We also show the simultaneous measurement of PARP1 and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) in a given protein extract. The approach presented in this work is expected to contribute to the accurate quantitative assessment of PARP1 levels in basic research and clinical studies.",

     "abstract": "Cells respond to DNA damage by activating cell cycle checkpoints, arresting cell division or DNA replication while damage is repaired. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, activation of the checkpoint kinase Rad53 leads to cell cycle arrest, with Rad53 deactivation required for proper resumption of the cell cycle. Rtt107 is a S. cerevisiae protein that acts as a scaffold in the response to DNA damage, and rtt107\u0394 mutants exhibit prolonged activation of Rad53 when subjected to replication stress. This phenotype has been attributed to checkpoint dampening, wherein an Rtt107-Slx4-Dpb11 interaction limits formation of a Rad9-Dpb11 complex that promotes Rad53 activation. However, we found that the rtt107\u0394 mutant contains higher levels of DNA damage during replication stress, presenting an alternative possible cause of Rad53 hyperactivation. We therefore sought to address the relevance of checkpoint dampening to the Rad53 hyperactivation phenotype of the rtt107\u0394 mutant by using a rad9-ST462,474AA allele that specifically disrupts Rad9-Dpb11 interaction. Incorporation of the rad9-ST462,474AA allele slightly suppressed the rtt107\u0394 mutant\u2019s DNA damage sensitivity phenotypes, while having little effect on Rad53 hyperactivation. This indicated that in the context of acute replication stress, Rad53 hyperactivation in the rtt107\u0394 mutant did not primarily result from Rad9-Dpb11 interaction. A H2A-S129A mutation, which generally reduces Rad9-mediated Rad53 activation, led to more robust suppression of rtt107\u0394 mutant phenotypes. Suppression of rtt107\u0394 mutant DNA damage sensitivity by the H2A-S129A or the rad9-ST462,474AA alleles required intact DNA damage tolerance pathways, indicating a reliance of the rtt107\u0394 mutant on tolerance pathways for reasons other than misregulation of Rad53 activity. Collectively, this work proposed a revised model of Rad53 hyperactivation after acute replicative stress in the rtt107\u0394 mutant, in which this phenotype was primarily a consequence of excess DNA damage.",

The \u03b5-subunit of a replisome generally acts as the main proofreader during replication, using its 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity to excise misincorporated bases thereby maintaining faithful replication. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), however, the polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) domain of the DNA polymerase DnaE1 is the primary proofreader. This domain thus maintains low mutation rates during replication and is an attractive target for drug development. Even though the structures of DnaE polymerases are available from various organisms, including Mtb, the mechanism of exonuclease activity remains elusive. In this study, we sought to unravel the mechanism and also to identify scaffolds that can specifically inhibit the exonuclease activity. To gain insight into the mode of action, we also characterized the PHP domain of the Mtb error-prone polymerase DnaE2 which shares a nearly identical active site with DnaE1-PHP. Kinetic and mutational studies allowed us to identify the critical residue involved in catalysis. Combined inhibition and computational studies also revealed a specific mode of inhibition of DnaE1-PHP by nucleoside diphosphates. Thus, this study lays the foundation for the rational design of novel inhibitors which target the Mtb replicative proofreader.",

     "abstract": "Chromatin regulators play crucial roles in the DNA damage response. While the chromatin changes needed for double-strand break repair and nucleotide excision repair have been intensely studied, the chromatin requirements of interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair have remained largely unexplored. Here, we studied the effect of silencing the INO80 chromatin remodeler subunits on the cellular response to ICLs. Cells depleted of Ino80 ATPase were more sensitive to mitomycin C (MMC) and defective in FANCD2 chromatin recruitment. Ino80-deficient cells displayed strongly reduced Chk1 phosphorylation after MMC treatment indicating impaired ATR-dependent DNA damage signaling, likely due to the significantly slower RPA foci formation which we observed in these cells. MMC treatment of cells silenced for FANCM - a protein required for ICL-induced checkpoint signaling, Ino80 or both genes simultaneously led to similar decreases in RPA phosphorylation suggesting that the two proteins were involved in the same checkpoint pathway. Co-immunoprecipitation data indicated that Ino80 and FANCM interact physically. Taken together our data demonstrate for the first time that the INO80 chromatin remodeler cooperates with FANCM to mediate ICL-induced checkpoint activation by promoting accumulation of RPA at the lesion sites. This constitutes a novel mechanism by which the INO80 chromatin remodeler participates in the repair of ICLs and genome integrity maintenance.",

     "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that DNA damage and p53 activation play major roles in the pathological process of motor neuron death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Human SpeedyA1 (Spy1), a member of the Speedy/Ringo family, enhances cell proliferation and promotes tumorigenesis. Further studies have demonstrated that Spy1 promotes cell survival and inhibits DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We showed that the Spy1 expression levels were substantially decreased in ALS motor neurons compared with wild-type controls both in vivo and in vitro by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and Immunoassay tests. In addition, we established that over-expression of human SOD1 mutant G93A led to a decreased expression of Spy1. Furthermore, DNA damage response was activated in SOD1G93A-transfected cells (mSOD1 cells). Moreover, decreased Spy1 expression reduced cell viability and further activated the DNA damage response in mSOD1 cells. In contrast, increased Spy1 expression improved cell viability and inhibited the DNA damage response in mSOD1 cells. These results suggest that Spy1 plays a protective role in ALS motor neurons. Importantly, these findings provide a novel direction for therapeutic options for patients with ALS as well as for trial designs, such as investigating the role of oncogenic proteins in ALS.",

     "abstract": "Expansion of a CGG-repeat tract in the 5\u2032 UTR of FMR1 is responsible for the Fragile X-related disorders (FXDs), FXTAS, FXPOI and FXS. Previous work in a mouse model of these disorders has implicated proteins in the base excision and the mismatch repair (MMR) pathways in the expansion mechanism. However, the precise role of these factors in this process is not well understood. The essential role of MutL\u03b3, a complex that plays a minor role in MMR but that is essential for resolving Holliday junctions during meiosis, raises the possibility that expansions proceed via a Holliday junction-like intermediate that is processed to generate a double-strand break (DSB). We show here in an FXD mouse model that LIG4, a ligase essential for non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), a form of DSB repair (DSBR), protects against expansions. However, a mutation in MRE11, a nuclease that is important for several other DSBR pathways including homologous recombination (HR), has no effect on the extent of expansion. Our results suggest that the expansion pathway competes with NHEJ for the processing of a DSB intermediate. Thus, expansion likely proceeds via an NHEJ-independent DSBR pathway that may also be HR-independent.",

     "abstract": "DSBs are harmful lesions produced through endogenous metabolism or by exogenous agents such as ionizing radiation, that can trigger genomic rearrangements. We have recently shown that exposure to 2\u2009Gy of X-rays has opposite effects on the induction of Shh-dependent MB in NHEJ- and HR-deficient Ptch1+/\u2212 mice. In the current study we provide a comprehensive link on the role of HR/NHEJ at low doses (0.042 and 0.25\u2009Gy) from the early molecular changes through DNA damage processing, up to the late consequences of their inactivation on tumorigenesis. Our data indicate a prominent role for HR in genome stability, by preventing spontaneous and radiation-induced oncogenic damage in neural precursors of the cerebellum, the cell of origin of MB. Instead, loss of DNA-PKcs function increased DSBs and apoptosis in neural precursors of the developing cerebellum, leading to killing of tumor initiating cells, and suppression of MB tumorigenesis in DNA-PKcs-/-/Ptch1+/\u2212 mice. Pathway analysis demonstrates that DNA-PKcs genetic inactivation confers a remarkable radiation hypersensitivity, as even extremely low radiation doses may deregulate many DDR genes, also triggering p53 pathway activation and cell cycle arrest. Finally, by showing that DNA-PKcs inhibition by NU7441 radiosensitizes human MB cells, our in vitro findings suggest the inclusion of MB in the list of tumors beneficiating from the combination of radiotherapy and DNA-PKcs targeting, holding promise for clinical translation.",

     "abstract": "The DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) created during meiotic recombination and during some types of chemotherapy contain protein covalently attached to their 5\u2032 termini. Removal of the end-blocking protein is a prerequisite to DSB processing by non-homologous end-joining or homologous recombination. One mechanism for removing the protein involves CtIP-stimulated Mre11-catalyzed nicking of the protein-linked strand distal to the DSB terminus, releasing the end-blocking protein while it remains covalently attached to an oligonucleotide. Much of what is known about this repair process has recently been deciphered through in vitro reconstitution studies. We present here a novel model system based on adenovirus (Ad), which contains the Ad terminal protein covalently linked to the 5\u2032 terminus of its dsDNA genome, for studying the repair of 5\u2032 protein-linked DSBs in vivo. It was previously shown that the genome of Ad mutants that lack early region 4 (E4) can be joined into concatemers in vivo, suggesting that the Ad terminal protein had been removed from the genome termini prior to ligation. Here we show that during infection with the E4-deleted Ad mutant dl1004, the Ad terminal protein is removed in a manner that recapitulates removal of end-blocking proteins from cellular DSBs. In addition to displaying a dependence on CtIP, and Mre11 acting as the endonuclease, the protein-linked oligonucleotides that are released from the viral genome are similar in size to the oligos that remain attached to Spo11 and Top2 after they are removed from the 5\u2032 termini of DSBs during meiotic recombination and etoposide chemotherapy, respectively. The single nucleotide resolution that is possible with this assay, combined with the single sequence context in which the lesion is presented, make it a useful tool for further refining our mechanistic understanding of how blocking proteins are removed from the 5\u2032 termini of DSBs.",

     "abstract": "DNA mismatch repair is an evolutionarily conserved repair pathway that corrects replication errors. In most prokaryotes and all eukaryotes, the mismatch repair protein MutL is a sequence-unspecific endonuclease that nicks the newly synthesized strand and marks it for repair. Although the sequence of the endonuclease domain of MutL is not conserved, eukaryotic MutL\u03b1 and prokaryotic MutL share four conserved motifs that define the endonuclease site of the protein. Their endonuclease activity is stimulated by the processivity sliding \u03b2-clamp, or its eukaryotic counterpart PCNA, highlighting the functional conservation. Bacterial MutL homologs form homodimers and, therefore, they have two endonuclease sites. However, eukaryotic MutL homologs associate to form heterodimers, where only one of the protomers of the dimer has endonuclease activity. To probe whether bacterial MutL needs its two endonuclease sites, we engineered variants of B. subtilis MutL harboring a single nuclease site and showed that these variants are functional nucleases. We also find that the protomer harboring the nuclease site must be able to bind to the \u03b2-clamp to recapitulate the nicking activity of wild-type MutL. These results demonstrate the functional asymmetry of bacterial MutL and strengthen the similarities with the endonuclease activity of eukaryotic MutL homologs.",

     "abstract": "DNA-PKcs deficiency has been studied in numerous animal models and cell culture systems. In previous studies of kinase inactivating mutations in cell culture systems, ablation of DNA-PK's catalytic activity results in a cell phenotype that is virtually indistinguishable from that ascribed to complete loss of the enzyme. However, a recent compelling study demonstrates a remarkably more severe phenotype in mice harboring a targeted disruption of DNA-PK's ATP binding site as compared to DNA-PKcs deficient mice. Here we investigate the mechanism for these divergent results. We find that kinase inactivating DNA-PKcs mutants markedly radiosensitize immortalized DNA-PKcs deficient cells, but have no substantial effects on transformed DNA-PKcs deficient cells. Since the non-homologous end joining mechanism likely functions similarly in all of these cell strains, it seems unlikely that kinase inactive DNA-PK could impair the end joining mechanism in some cell types, but not in others. In fact, we observed no significant differences in either episomal or chromosomal end joining assays in cells expressing kinase inactivated DNA-PKcs versus no DNA-PKcs. Several potential explanations could explain these data including a non-catalytic role for DNA-PKcs in promoting cell death, or alteration of gene expression by loss of DNA-PKcs as opposed to inhibition of its catalytic activity.Finally, controversy exists as to whether DNA-PKcs autophosphorylates or is the target of other PIKKs; we present data demonstrating that DNA-PK primarily autophosphorylates.",

     "abstract": "The accelerated ageing disease Werner Syndrome (WRN) is characterized by pronounced atherosclerosis. Here, we investigated the influence of WRN downregulation on the functionality of non-replicating human endothelial cells. RNAi-mediated downregulation of WRN reduces cell motility and enhances the expression of factors regulating adhesion, inflammation, hemostasis and vasomotor tone. Moreover, WRN influences endothelial barrier function and Ca2+-release, while cell adhesion, Dil-acLDL-uptake and the mRNA expression of NO-synthases (eNOS, iNOS) remained unaffected. Regarding motility, we propose that WRN affects Rac1/FAK/\u00df1-integrin-related mechanisms regulating cell polarity and directed motility. Since oxidative DNA base damage contributes to aging and atherosclerosis and WRN affects DNA repair, we investigated whether downregulation of base excision repair (BER) factors mimics the effects of WRN knock-down. Indeed, downregulation of particular WRN-interacting base excision repair (BER) proteins (APE1, NEIL1, PARP1) imitates the inhibitory effect of WRN on motility. Knock-down of OGG1, which does not interact with WRN, does not influence motility but increases the mRNA expression of E-selectin, ICAM, VCAM, CCL2 and VEGFR and stimulates adhesion. Thus, individual BER factors themselves differently impact endothelial cell functionality and homeostasis. Impairment of endothelial activities caused by genotoxic stressor (tBHQ) remained largely unaffected by WRN. Summarizing, both WRN, WRN-associated BER proteins and OGG1 promote the maintenance of endothelial cell homeostasis, thereby counteracting the development of ageing-related endothelial malfunction in non-proliferating endothelial cells.",

     "abstract": "Cisplatin is a highly effective chemotherapeutic drug acting as a DNA-damaging agent that induces apoptosis of rapidly proliferating cells. Unfortunately, cellular resistance still occurs. Mutations in p53 in a large fraction of tumor cells contribute to defects in apoptotic pathways and drug resistance. To uncover new strategies to eliminate tumors through a p53-independent pathway, we established a simplified model devoid of p53 to study cisplatin-induced regulated cell death, using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We previously showed that cisplatin induces an active form of cell death accompanied by DNA condensation and fragmentation/degradation, but no significant mitochondrial dysfunction. We further demonstrated that proteasome inhibition, either with MG132 or genetically, increased resistance to cisplatin. In this study, we sought to determine how proteasome inhibition is important for cisplatin resistance by analyzing how it affects several phenotypes associated with the DNA damage response. We found MG132 does not seem to affect the activation of the DNA damage response or increase damage tolerance. Moreover, central modulators of the DNA damage response are not required for cisplatin resistance imparted by MG132. These results suggest the proteasome is involved in modulation of cisplatin toxicity downstream of DNA damage. Proteasome inhibitors can sensitize tumor cells to cisplatin, but protect others from cisplatin-induced cell death. Elucidation of this mechanism will therefore aid in the development of new strategies to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "A variety of agents cause DNA base alkylation damage, including the known hepatocarcinogen aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and chemotherapeutic drugs derived from nitrogen mustard (NM). The N7 site of guanine is the primary site of alkylation, with some N7-deoxyguanosine adducts undergoing imidazole ring-opening to stable mutagenic N5-alkyl formamidopyrimidine (Fapy-dG) adducts. These adducts exist as a mixture of canonical \u03b2- and unnatural \u03b1-anomeric forms. The \u03b2 species are predominant in double-stranded (ds) DNA. Recently, we have demonstrated that the DNA glycosylase NEIL1 can initiate repair of AFB1-Fapy-dG adducts both in vitro and in vivo, with Neil1\u2212/\u2212 mice showing an increased susceptibility to AFB1-induced hepatocellular carcinoma.Here, we hypothesized that NEIL1 could excise NM-Fapy-dG and that NEIL3, a closely related DNA glycosylase, could excise both NM-Fapy-dG and AFB1-Fapy-dG. Product formation from the reaction of human NEIL1 with ds oligodeoxynucleotides containing a unique NM-Fapy-dG followed a bi-component exponential function under single turnover conditions. Thus, two adduct conformations were differentially recognized by hNEIL1. The excision rate of the major form (\u223c13.0\u2009min\u22121), presumed to be the \u03b2-anomer, was significantly higher than that previously reported for 5-hydroxycytosine, 5-hydroxyuracil, thymine glycol (Tg), and AFB1-Fapy-dG. Product generation from the minor form was much slower (\u223c0.4\u2009min\u22121), likely reflecting the rate of conversion of the \u03b1 anomer into the \u03b2 anomer. Mus musculus NEIL3 (MmuNEIL3\u0394324) excised NM-Fapy-dG from single-stranded (ss) DNA (turnover rate of \u223c0.4\u2009min\u22121), but not from ds DNA. Product formation from ss substrate was incomplete, presumably because of a substantial presence of the \u03b1 anomer. MmuNEIL3\u0394324 could not initiate repair of AFB1-Fapy-dG in either ds or ss DNA. Overall, the data suggest that both NEIL1 and NEIL3 may protect cells against cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of NM-Fapy-dG, but NEIL1 may have a unique role in initiation of base excision repair of AFB1-Fapy-dG.",

A number of stimuli activate ATR, including persistent single-stranded DNA at stalled replication folks, R loop formation, hypoxia, ultraviolet light, and oxidative stress, leading to ATR-mediated protein phosphorylation. Recently, hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gasotransmitter, has been found to regulate multiple cellular processes through complex redox reactions under similar cell stress environments. Three enzymes synthesize H2S: cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase, cystathionine \u03b3-lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. Since H2S can under some conditions cause DNA damage, we hypothesized that ATR activity may regulate cellular H2S concentrations and H2S-syntheszing enzymes. Here we show that human colorectal cancer cells carrying biallelic knock-in hypomorphic ATR mutations have lower cellular H2S concentrations than do syngeneic ATR wild-type cells, and all three H2S-synthesizing enzymes show lower protein expression in the ATR hypomorphic mutant cells. Additionally, ATR serine 428 phosphorylation is altered by H2S donor and H2S synthesis enzyme inhibition, while the oxidative-stress induced phosphorylation of the ATR-regulated protein CHK1 on serine 345 is increased by H2S synthesis enzyme inhibition. Lastly, inhibition of H2S production potentiated oxidative stress-induced double-stranded DNA breaks in the ATR hypomorphic mutant compared to ATR wild-type cells. Our findings demonstrate that the ATR kinase regulates and is regulated by H2S.",

     "abstract": "Human DNA polymerase \u03b4 is normally present in unstressed, non-dividing cells as a heterotetramer (Pol \u03b44). Its smallest subunit, p12, is transiently degraded in response to UV damage, as well as during the entry into S-phase, resulting in the conversion of Pol \u03b44 to a trimer (Pol \u03b43). In order to further understand the specific cellular roles of these two forms of Pol \u03b4, the gene (POLD4) encoding p12 was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 to produce p12 knockout (p12KO) cells. Thus, Pol \u03b44 is absent in p12KO cells, leaving Pol \u03b43 as the sole source of Pol \u03b4 activity. GFP reporter assays revealed that the p12KO cells exhibited a defect in homologous recombination (HR) repair, indicating that Pol \u03b44,\u2009 but not Pol \u03b43, is required for HR. Expression of Flag-tagged p12 in p12KO cells to restore Pol \u03b44 alleviated the HR defect. These results establish a specific requirement for Pol \u03b44 in HR repair. This leads to the prediction that p12KO cells should be more sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents, and should exhibit synthetic lethal killing by PARP inhibitors. These predictions were confirmed by clonogenic cell survival assays of p12KO cells treated with cisplatin and mitomycin C, and with the PARP inhibitors Olaparib, Talazoparib, Rucaparib, and Niraparib. The sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in H1299-p12KO cells was alleviated by expression of Flag-p12. These findings have clinical significance, as the expression levels of p12 could be a predictive biomarker of tumor response to PARP inhibitors. In addition, small cell lung cancers (SCLC) are known to exhibit a defect in p12 expression. Analysis of several SCLC cell lines showed that they exhibit hypersensitivity to PARP inhibitors, providing evidence that loss of p12 expression could represent a novel molecular basis for HR deficiency.",

Previously, PARP-1 was found capable of forming a covalent DNA-protein crosslink (DPC) at the apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site in double-stranded DNA. The C1\u00b4 atom of the AP site participates in Schiff base formation with a lysine side chain in PARP-1, and a covalent bond is formed upon reduction of the Schiff base. The PARP-1 DPC is formed in vivo where DPC formation correlates with AP site induction by a monofunctional alkylating agent. Here, we examined repair of PARP-1 DPCs in mouse fibroblasts and found that a proteasome inhibitor, MG-132, reduces repair resulting in accumulation of PARP-1 DPCs and increased alkylating agent cytotoxicity. Using a model DNA substrate mimicking the PARP-1 DPC after proteasomal degradation, we found that repair is completed by a sub-pathway of base excision repair (BER). Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 was proficient in removing the ring-open AP site sugar at the phosphodiester linkage, leaving an intermediate for processing by other BER enzymes. The results reveal proteasomal degradation of the PARP-1 DPC is active in mouse fibroblasts and that a model repair intermediate is processed by the BER machinery.",

Most of these repair reactions have been described in the African trypanosome Trypanosoma brucei, which is a genetically tractable eukaryotic microbe and important human and animal parasite, but little work has considered how the DNA damage response operates throughout the T. brucei life cycle. Using quantitative PCR we have assessed damage induction and repair in both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of the parasite. We show differing kinetics of repair for three forms of DNA damage, and dramatic differences in repair between replicative life cycle forms found in the testse fly midgut and the mammal. We find that mammal-infective T. brucei cells repair oxidative and crosslink-induced DNA damage more efficiently than tsetse-infective cells and, moreover, very distinct patterns of induction and repair of DNA alkylating damage in the two life cycle forms. We also reveal robust repair of DNA lesions in the highly unusual T. brucei mitochondrial genome (the kinetoplast). By examining mutants we show that nuclear alkylation damage is repaired by the concerted action of two repair pathways, and that Rad51 acts in kinetoplast repair. Finally, we correlate repair with cell cycle arrest and cell growth, revealing that induced DNA damage has strikingly differing effects on the two life cycle stages, with distinct timing of alkylation-induced cell cycle arrest and higher levels of damage induced death in mammal-infective cells. Our data reveal that T. brucei regulates the DNA damage response during its life cycle, a capacity that may be shared by many microbial pathogens that exist in variant environments during growth and transmission.",

While efficient NER is critical to avoid cell death and mutagenesis, NER activity is inhibited in chromatin due to the association of lesion-containing DNA with histone proteins. Histone acetylation has emerged as an important mechanism for facilitating NER in chromatin, particularly acetylation catalyzed by the Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase (SAGA); however, it is not known if other histone acetyltransferases (HATs) promote NER activity in chromatin. Here, we report that the essential Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of histone H4 (NuA4) complex is required for efficient NER in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the non-essential Yng2 subunit of the NuA4 complex causes a general defect in repair of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) in yeast; in contrast, deletion of the Sas3 catalytic subunit of the NuA3 complex does not affect repair. Rapid depletion of the essential NuA4 catalytic subunit Esa1 using the anchor-away method also causes a defect in NER, particularly at the heterochromatic HML locus. We show that disrupting the Sds3 subunit of the Rpd3L histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex rescued the repair defect associated with loss of Esa1 activity, suggesting that NuA4-catalyzed acetylation is important for efficient NER in heterochromatin.",

As a result, multiple levels of regulation are imposed on the polymerases so as to avoid aberrant mutagenesis. We report here, that the mutagenesis-promoting activity of polVICE391 is additionally regulated by a transcriptional repressor encoded by SetRICE391, since Escherichia coli expressing SetRICE391 demonstrated reduced levels of polVICE391\u2013mediated spontaneous mutagenesis relative to cells lacking SetRICE391. SetRICE391 regulation was shown to be specific for the rumAB operon and in vitro studies with highly purified SetRICE391 revealed that under alkaline conditions, as well as in the presence of activated RecA, SetRICE391 undergoes a self-mediated cleavage reaction that inactivates repressor functions. Conversely, a non-cleavable SetRICE391 mutant capable of maintaining repressor activity, even in the presence of activated RecA, exhibited low levels of polVICE391-dependent mutagenesis. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that SetRICE391 acts as a transcriptional repressor by binding to a site overlapping the -35 region of the rumAB operon promoter. Our study therefore provides evidence indicating that SetRICE391 acts as a transcriptional repressor of the ICE391-encoded mutagenic response.",

As a downstream consequence of restoring the ubiquitin ligase activity of mutated BRCA15382insC, the DNA repair response of p53 was enhanced in cellular extracts naturally deficient in BRCA1 protein expression.

Human telomeres contain repeated TTAGGG elements, in which the 3\u2032 exposed strand may adopt a G-quadruplex (G4) structure. The guanine-rich regions of telomeres are hotspots for oxidation forming 8-oxoguanine, a lesion that is handled by the base excision repair (BER) pathway. One key player of this pathway is Ape1, the main human endonuclease processing abasic sites. Recent evidences showed an important role for Ape1 in telomeric physiology, but the molecular details regulating Ape1 enzymatic activities on G4-telomeric sequences are lacking. Through a combination of in vitro assays, we demonstrate that Ape1 can bind and process different G4\u2009structures and that this interaction involves specific acetylatable lysine residues (i.e. K27/31/32/35) present in the unstructured N-terminal sequence of the protein. The cleavage of an abasic site located in a G4\u2009structure by Ape1 depends on the DNA conformation or the position of the lesion and on electrostatic interactions between the protein and the nucleic acids. Moreover, Ape1 mutants mimicking the acetylated protein display increased cleavage activity for abasic sites. We found that nucleophosmin (NPM1), which binds the N-terminal sequence of Ape1, plays a role in modulating telomere length and Ape1 activity at abasic G4\u2009structures. Thus, the Ape1 N-terminal sequence is an important relay site for regulating the enzyme\u2019s activity on G4-telomeric sequences, and specific acetylatable lysine residues constitute key regulatory sites of Ape1 enzymatic activity dynamics at telomeres.",

It can repair hundreds of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks without loss of viability and reconstitute an intact genome through RecA-dependent and RecA-independent DNA repair pathways. Among the Deinococcus specific proteins required for radioresistance, the PprA protein was shown to play a major role for accurate chromosome segregation and cell division after completion of DNA repair. Here, we analyzed the cellular role of the deinococcal RecN protein belonging to the SMC family and, surprisingly, observed that the absence of the RecN protein suppressed the sensitivity of cells devoid of the PprA protein to \u03b3- and UV-irradiation and to treatment with MMC or DNA gyrase inhibitors. This suppression was not observed when \u0394pprA cells were devoid of SMC or SbcC, two other proteins belonging to the SMC family. The absence of RecN also alleviated the DNA segregation defects displayed by \u0394pprA cells recovering from \u03b3-irradiation. When exposed to 5 kGy \u03b3-irradiation, \u0394pprA, \u0394recN and \u0394pprA \u0394recN cells repaired their DNA with a delay of about one hour, as compared to the wild type cells. After irradiation, the absence of RecN reduced recombination between chromosomal and plasmid DNA, indicating that the deinococcal RecN protein is important for recombinational repair of DNA lesions. The transformation efficiency of genomic DNA was also reduced in the absence of the RecN protein. Here, we propose a model in which RecN, via its cohesin activity, might favor recombinational repair of DNA double strand breaks. This might increase, in irradiated cells, DNA constraints with PprA protein being required to resolve them via its ability to recruit DNA gyrase and to stimulate its decatenation activity.",

The presence of ribonucleotides in DNA is associated with genome instability, causing replication stress, chromosome fragility, gross chromosomal rearrangements, and other mutagenic events. Furthermore, nucleosome and chromatin assembly as well as nucleosome positioning are affected by the presence of ribonucleotides. Notably, nucleosome formation is significantly reduced by a single ribonucleotide. Single ribonucleotides are primarily removed from DNA by the ribonucleotide excision repair (RER) pathway via the RNase H2 enzyme, which incises the DNA backbone on the 5\u2032-side of the ribonucleotide. While the structural implications of a single ribonucleotide in free duplex DNA have been well studied, how a single ribonucleotide embedded in nucleosomal DNA impacts nucleosome structure and dynamics, and the possible consequent impact on RER, have not been explored. We have carried out 3.5\u2009\u03bcs molecular dynamics simulations of a single ribonucleotide incorporated at various translational and rotational positions in a nucleosome core particle.

Our objective in this study was to identify the genes necessary to mitigate formaldehyde toxicity following chronic exposure in human cells. We used siRNAs that targeted 320 genes representing all major human DNA repair and damage response pathways, in order to assess cell proliferation following siRNA depletion and subsequent formaldehyde treatment. Three unrelated human cell lines frequently used in genotoxicity studies (SW480, U-2 OS and GM00639) were used to identify common pathways involved in mitigating formaldehyde sensitivity. Although there were gene-specific differences among the cell lines, four inter-related cellular pathways were determined to mitigate formaldehyde toxicity: homologous recombination, DNA double-strand break repair, ionizing radiation response and DNA replication. Additional insight into cell line-specific response patterns was obtained by using a combination of exome sequencing and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia genomic data.

The major clinical feature of A-T is cerebellar atrophy, characterized by relentless loss of Purkinje and granule cells. In Atm-knockout (Atm-KO) mice, complete loss of Atm leads to a very mild neurological phenotype, suggesting that Atm loss is not sufficient to markedly abrogate cerebellar structure and function in this organism. Expression of inactive (\u201ckinase-dead\u201d) Atm (AtmKD) in mice leads to embryonic lethality, raising the question of whether conditional expression of AtmKD in the murine nervous system would lead to a more pronounced neurological phenotype than Atm loss. We generated two mouse strains in which AtmKD was conditionally expressed as the sole Atm species: one in the CNS and one specifically in Purkinje cells. Focusing our analysis on Purkinje cells, the dynamics of DSB readouts indicated that DSB repair was delayed longer in the presence of AtmKD compared to Atm loss. However, both strains exhibited normal life span and displayed no gross cerebellar histological abnormalities or significant neurological phenotype. We conclude that the presence of AtmKD is indeed more harmful to DSB repair than Atm loss, but the murine central nervous system can reasonably tolerate the extent of this DSB repair impairment.

In the current study we have investigated the role of Mfd and UvrD in mutational processes in soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida. Our results revealed that UvrD helicase is essential to prevent the emergence of mutations, as the loss of uvrD resulted in elevated mutant frequency both in exponential- and stationary-phase bacterial cultures. UvrD was also found to be necessary to survive DNA damage, but NER or MMR pathways are not completely abolished in UvrD-deficient P. putida. Mfd-deficiency had a moderate impact on surviving DNA damage and did not influence the frequency of mutations occurred in exponentially growing bacteria. However, the absence of Mfd caused approximately a two-fold decline in stationary-phase mutant frequency compared to the P. putida wild-type strain and suppressed the elevated mutant frequency observed in the \u0394uvrD strain. Remarkably, the Mfd-deficient strain also formed less UV-induced mutants. These results suggest that in P. putida the Mfd-mediated TCR could be associated with UV- and stationary-phase mutagenesis.",

In the silenced mating locus and telomere region H4 K16 mutants show higher recruitment of Sir proteins and spreading beyond the designated boundaries. More significantly, chromatin of both the H4 K16 mutants has reduced accessibility in the silenced regions and genome wide. On UV irradiation, the mutants showed higher UV sensitivity, reduced NER rate and altered H3 N-terminal tail acetylation, compared to wild type. NER efficiency is affected by reduced or delayed recruitment of early NER proteins and chromatin remodeller Swi/Snf along with lack of nucleosome rearrangement during repair. Additionally UV-induced expression of RAD and SNF5 genes was reduced in the mutants. Hindered chromatin accessibility in the H4 K16 mutants is thus non-conducive for gene expression as well as recruitment of NER and chromatin remodeller proteins. Subsequently, inadequate nucleosomal rearrangement during early phases of repair impeded accessibility of the NER complex to DNA lesions, in the H4 K16 mutants. Effectively, NER efficiency was found to be compromised in the mutants. Interestingly, in the transcriptionally active chromatin region, both the H4 K16 mutants showed reduced NER rate during early repair time points. However, with progression of repair H4 K16R repaired faster than K16Q mutants and rate of CPD removal became differential between the two mutants during later NER phases. To summarize, our results establish the essentiality of regulated acetylation and deacetylation of H4 K16 residue in maintaining chromatin accessibility and efficiency of functions like NER and gene expression.",

The three members of this structural superfamily are uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG/UDG), single-strand selective monofunctional uracil DNA glycosylase (SMUG1), and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). We previously reported that UDG is efficient at removing U from DNA packaged into nucleosome core particles (NCP) and is minimally affected by the histone proteins when acting on an outward-facing U in the dyad region. In an effort to determine whether this high activity is a general property of the UDG superfamily of glycosylases, we compare the activity of UDG, SMUG1, and TDG on a U:G wobble base pair using NCP assembled from Xenopus laevis histones and the Widom 601 positioning sequence. We found that while UDG is highly active, SMUG1 is severely inhibited on NCP and this inhibition is independent of sequence context. Here we also provide the first report of TDG activity on an NCP, and found that TDG has an intermediate level of activity in excision of U and is severely inhibited in its excision of T. These results are discussed in the context of cellular roles for each of these enzymes.",

H2Bub1 plays roles in telomeric silencing and telomere replication. Here, we have explored a novel role of H2Bub1 in telomere protection at uncapped telomeres in yku70\u0394 and cdc13-1 cells. Deletion of RAD6 or BRE1, or mutation of H2BK123R enhances the temperature sensitivity of both yku70\u0394 and cdc13-1 telomere capping mutants. Consistently, BRE1 deletion increases accumulation of telomeric single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in yku70\u0394 and cdc13-1 cells, and EXO1 deletion improves the growth of yku70\u0394 bre1\u0394 and cdc13-1 bre1\u0394 cells and decreases ssDNA accumulation. Additionally, deletion of BRE1 exacerbates the rate of entry into senescence of yku70\u0394 mre11\u0394 cells with telomere defects, and increases the recombination of subtelomeric Y\u2032 element that is required for telomere maintenance and survivor generation. Furthermore, Exo1 contributes to the abrupt senescence of yku70\u0394 mre11\u0394 bre1\u0394 cells, and Rad51 is essential for Y\u2032 recombination to generate survivors. Finally, deletion of BRE1 or mutation of H2BK123R results in nucleosome instability at subtelomeric regions. Collectively, this study provides a mechanistic link between H2Bub1-mediated chromatin structure and telomere protection after telomere uncapping.",

DNA lesions associated with 5-fluorouracil therapy are primarily repaired by base excision repair (BER) and mismatch repair (MMR) pathways. Published evidence suggests that the individual DNA repair capacity (DRC) may affect a patient\u2019s prognosis and response to chemotherapy.With this in mind, we designed a prospective study of which the main aim was to investigate BER-DRC in relation to 5-fluorouracil response as potential predictive and/or prognostic biomarker. BER-DRC was supplemented by a microsatellite instability (MSI) analysis which represents an indirect marker of MMR activity in the tumor. All parameters were measured in paired samples of tumor tissue and non-malignant adjacent mucosa of 123 incident colon cancer patients.Our results indicate that BER-DRC in non-malignant adjacent mucosa was positively associated with overall survival (P\u2009=\u20090.007) and relapse-free survival (P\u2009=\u20090.04). Additionally, in multivariate analysis, good therapy responders in TNM stage II and III with an elevated BER-DRC in mucosa exhibited better overall survival. Moreover, the overall survival of these patients was even better in the presence of a decreased BER-DRC in tumor tissue. The ratio of BER-DRC in tumor tissue over BER-DRC in mucosa positively correlated with advanced tumor stage (P\u2009=\u20090.003). With respect to MSI, we observed that MSI-high tumors were mostly localized in proximal colon; however, in our cohort, the MSI status affected neither patients\u2019 prognosis nor survival.In summary, the results of the present study suggest that the level of BER-DRC is associated with patients\u2019 survival. BER-DRC represents a potential prognostic biomarker, applicable for prediction of therapy response and useful for individual approach to patients.",

     "abstract": "The N protein of phage Mu was indicated from studies in Escherichia coli to hold linear Mu chromosomes in a circular conformation by non-covalent association, and thus suggested potentially to bind DNA double-stranded ends. Because of its role in association with linear Mu DNA, we tested whether fluorescent-protein fusions to N might provide a useful tool for labeling DNA damage including double-strand break (DSB) ends in single cells. We compared N-GFP with a biochemically well documented DSB-end binding protein, the Gam protein of phage Mu, also fused to GFP. We find that N-GFP produced in live E. coli forms foci in response to DNA damage induced by radiomimetic drug phleomycin, indicating that it labels damaged DNA. N-GFP also labels specific DSBs created enzymatically by I-SceI double-strand endonuclease, and by X-rays, with the numbers of foci corresponding with the numbers of DSBs generated, indicating DSB labeling. However, whereas N-GFP forms about half as many foci as GamGFP with phleomycin, its labeling of I-SceI- and X-ray-induced DSBs is far less efficient than that of GamGFP. The data imply that N-GFP binds and labels DNA damage including DSBs, but may additionally label phleomycin-induced non-DSB damage, with which DSB-specific GamGFP does not interact. The data indicate that N-GFP labels DNA damage, and may be useful for general, not DSB-specific, DNA-damage detection.",

The aim of the current study was to investigate the association between rs11552449 and the degree of cellular sensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC) and ionizing radiation (IR). A total of 69 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from generally healthy donors were tested for their sensitivity towards MMC and IR in growth inhibition experiments. LCLs heterozygous for rs11552449 were significantly more sensitive to MMC and IR than homozygous cells with the CC genotype (p\u2009<\u20090.05 and p\u2009<\u20090.01 for MMC and IR, respectively) and in the case of MMC also for the TT genotype (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Interestingly, heterozygous CT cells expressed significantly more full length hSNM1B/Apollo mRNA than cells with the homozygous CC (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) or TT genotypes (p\u2009<\u20090.00001). Thus, the observed higher sensitivity of cell lines heterozygous for rs11552449 towards MMC and IR may be a consequence of differential expression of hSNM1B/Apollo associated with rs11552449, a feature which has not been ascribed to this polymorphism before.

     "abstract": "Reporter gene assays, in which a single mutation from each experiment can contribute to the assembly of a mutation spectrum for an agent, have provided the basis for understanding the mutational processes induced by mutagenic agents and for providing clues to the origins of mutations in human tumours. More recently exome and whole genome sequencing of human tumours has revealed distinct patterns of mutation that could provide additional clues for the causative origins of cancer. This can be tested by examining the mutational signatures induced in experimental systems by putative cancer-causing agents. Such signatures are now being generated in vitro in a number of different mutagen-exposed cellular systems. Results reveal that mutagens induce characteristic mutation signatures that, in some cases, match signatures found in human tumours. Proof of principle has been established with mutational signatures generated by simulated sunlight and aristolochic acid, which match those signatures found in human melanomas and urothelial cancers, respectively. In an analysis of somatic mutations in cancers for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk, it was found that smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple different mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different tissues. One of these signatures, mainly found in tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clock-like mutational process. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutation load although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some cancer types. Thus, next generation sequencing of exomes or whole genomes is providing new insights into processes underlying the causes of human cancer.",

     "abstract": "In a multicellular organism, somatic mutations represent a permanent record of the past chemical and biochemical perturbations experienced by a cell in its local microenvironment. Akin to a perpetual recording device, with every replication, genomic DNA accumulates mutations in patterns that reflect: i) the sequence context-dependent formation of DNA damage, due to environmental or endogenous reactive species, including spontaneous processes; ii) the activity of DNA repair pathways, which, depending on the type of lesion, can erase, ignore or exacerbate the mutagenic consequences of that DNA damage; and iii) the choice of replication machinery that synthesizes the nascent genomic copy. These three factors result in a richly contoured sequence context-dependent mutational spectrum that, from appearances, is distinct for most individual forms of DNA damage. Such a mutagenic legacy, if appropriately decoded, can reveal the local history of genome-altering events such as chemical or pathogen exposures, metabolic stress, and inflammation, which in turn can provide an indication of the underlying causes and mechanisms of genetic disease. Modern tools have positioned us to develop a deep mechanistic understanding of the cellular factors and pathways that modulate a mutational process and, in turn, provide opportunities for better diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, better exposure risk assessment and even actionable therapeutic targets. The goal of this Perspective is to present a bottom-up, lesion-centric framework of mutagenesis that integrates the contributions of lesion replication, lesion repair and lesion formation to explain the complex mutational spectra that emerge in the genome following exposure to mutagens.

Likewise, recent studies have observed pervasive engagement of a p53-mediated response, and other factors linked to maintenance of genomic integrity, in response to misfolded protein stress. Perhaps most remarkably, protein aggregation and self-assembly has now been observed in multiple proteins that regulate the DNA damage response.

However, the DNA template of Pol II is continuously challenged by damaging agents that can result in transcription impediment. Stalling of Pol II on transcription-blocking lesions triggers a highly orchestrated cellular response to cope with these cytotoxic lesions. One of the first lines of defense is the transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) pathway that specifically removes transcription-blocking lesions thereby safeguarding unperturbed gene expression. In this perspective, we outline recent data on how lesion-stalled Pol II initiates TC-NER and we discuss new mechanistic insights in the TC-NER reaction, which have resulted in a better understanding of the causative-linked Cockayne syndrome and UV-sensitive syndrome. In addition to these direct effects on lesion-stalled Pol II (effects in cis), accumulating evidence shows that transcription, and particularly Pol II, is also affected in a genome-wide manner (effects in trans). We will summarize the diverse consequences of DNA damage on transcription, including transcription inhibition, induction of specific transcriptional programs and regulation of alternative splicing. Finally, we will discuss the function of these diverse cellular responses to transcription-blocking lesions and their consequences on the process of transcription restart.

Although R-loops occur naturally in all kingdoms of life and serve regulatory roles, they are often deleterious and can cause genomic instability. Of particular importance are the disastrous consequences when replication forks or transcription complexes collide with R-loops. The appropriate processing of R-loops is essential to avoid a number of human neurodegenerative and other clinical disorders. We provide a perspective on mechanistic aspects of R-loop formation and their resolution learned from studies in model systems. This should contribute to improved understanding of R-loop biological functions and enable their practical applications.

     "abstract": "Before a deleterious DNA lesion can be replaced with its undamaged counterpart, the lesion must first be removed from the genome. This process of removing and replacing DNA lesions is accomplished by the careful coordination of several protein factors during DNA repair. One such factor is the multifunctional enzyme human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), known best for its DNA backbone cleavage activity at AP sites during base excision repair (BER). APE1 preforms AP site incision with surgical precision and skill, by sculpting the DNA to place the cleavage site in an optimal position for nucleophilic attack within its compact protein active site. APE1, however, has demonstrated broad surgical expertise, and applies its DNA cleavage activity to a wide variety of DNA and RNA substrates. Here, we discuss what is known and unknown about APE1 cleavage mechanisms, focusing on structural and mechanistic considerations. Importantly, disruptions in the biological functions associated with APE1 are linked to numerous human maladies, including cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. The continued elucidation of APE1 mechanisms is required for rational drug design towards novel and strategic ways to target its associated repair pathways.",

Many of the enzymes in the base excision DNA repair pathway are capable of processive searching. Here, we briefly summarize methodology for determining if a protein can scan DNA and highlight the discovery that the base excision repair DNA polymerase \u03b2 performs a processive search.

     "abstract": "Normal DNA replication is blocked by DNA damage in the template strand. Translesion synthesis is a major pathway for overcoming these replication blocks. In this process, multiple non-classical DNA polymerases are thought to form a complex at the stalled replication fork that we refer to as the mutasome. This hypothetical multi-protein complex is structurally organized by the replication accessory factor PCNA and the non-classical polymerase Rev1. One of the non-classical polymerases within this complex then catalyzes replication through the damage. Each non-classical polymerase has one or more cognate lesions, which the enzyme bypasses with high accuracy and efficiency. Thus, the accuracy and efficiency of translesion synthesis depends on which non-classical polymerase is chosen to bypass the damage. In this review article, we discuss how the most appropriate polymerase is chosen. In so doing, we examine the structural motifs that mediate the protein interactions in the mutasome; the multiple architectures that the mutasome can adopt, such as PCNA tool belts and Rev1 bridges; the intrinsically disordered regions that tether the polymerases to PCNA and to one another; and the kinetic selection model in which the most appropriate polymerase is chosen via a competition among the multiple polymerases within the mutasome.",

This includes increased mutation rates, small and large scale genomic rearrangement and deleterious consequences for the subsequent mitosis that result in the transmission of additional DNA damage to the daughter cells. Therefore, preserving fork integrity and replication competence is an important aspect of how cells respond to replication stress and avoid genetic change. Homologous recombination is a pivotal pathway in the maintenance of genome integrity in the face of replication stress. Here we review our recent understanding of the mechanisms by which homologous recombination acts to protect, restart and repair replication forks. We discuss the dynamics of these genetically distinct functions and their contribution to faithful mitoticsegregation.",

For instance, even though many of the proteins involved in mitotic and meiotic HR are the same, DNA target specificity is not: mitotic DSBs are repaired primarily using the sister chromatid as a template, whereas meiotic DBSs are repaired primarily through targeting of the homologous chromosome. These changes in template specificity are induced by expression of meiosis-specific HR proteins, down-regulation of mitotic HR proteins, and the formation of meiosis-specific chromosomal structures. Here, we compare and contrast the biochemical properties of key recombination intermediates formed during the pre-synapsis phase of mitotic and meiotic HR.

     "abstract": "Canonical DNA non-homologous end-joining (c-NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), the two major DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathways, have long been depicted as competitors, fighting a race to rejoin DSBs. In human cells, Ku, an upstream component of NHEJ, is highly abundant and has exquisite end-binding capacity. Emerging evidence has suggested that Ku is the first protein binding most, if not all, DSBs, and creates a block to resection. Although most c-NHEJ proceeds without resection, recent studies have provided strong evidence for a process of resection-dependent c-NHEJ, that repairs a subset of DSBs. HR also repairs a subset of two-ended DSBs in G2 phase and processes one-ended DSBs that arise following replication fork stalling or collapse to promote replication restart. HR also necessitates end-resection. This raises the question of how end-resection takes place despite Ku\u2019s avid end-binding capacity. Insight into this enigma has been gained from the analysis of DSBs generated by Spo11 or TOP2, which create protein-bridged DSBs. The progression of repair by HR or NHEJ requires removal of the end-blocking lesions. The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, CtIP and EXO1 play critical roles in this process. Here, we review our current understanding of how resection arises at lesions blocked by covalently bound Spo11 or TOP2 or following Ku binding, which effectively creates a distinct resection-blocking lesion due to its avid end-binding activity and abundance. Our review reveals that Ku plays an active role in determining pathway choice and exposes similarities yet distinctions in the progression of resection that is suited to the optimal repair pathway choice.",

     "abstract": "Repair pathways of covalent DNA damage are understood in considerable detail due to decades of brilliant biochemical studies by many investigators. An important feature of these experiments is the defined adduct location on oligonucleotide or plasmid substrates that are incubated with purified proteins or cell free extracts. With some exceptions, this certainty is lost when the inquiry shifts to the response of living mammalian cells to the same adducts in genomic DNA. This reflects the limitation of assays, such as those based on immunofluorescence, that are widely used to follow responding proteins in cells exposed to a DNA reactive compound. The lack of effective reagents for adduct detection means that the proximity between responding proteins and an adduct must be assumed.

     "abstract": "DNA is associated with proteins that are involved in its folding and transaction processes. When cells are exposed to chemical cross-linking agents or free radical\u2013generating ionizing radiation, DNA-associated proteins are covalently trapped within the DNA to produce DNA\u2013protein cross-links (DPCs). DPCs produced by these agents contain cross-linked proteins in an undisrupted DNA strand. Some DNA-metabolizing enzymes that form covalent reaction intermediates can also be irreversibly trapped in the presence of inhibitors or DNA damage to give rise to abortive DPCs. The abortive DPCs often contain cross-linked proteins attached to the 5\u2032 or 3\u2032 end of a DNA strand break. In vitro studies show that steric hindrance caused by cross-linked proteins impedes the progression of DNA helicases and polymerases and of RNA polymerases. The modes and consequences by which DPCs impede replication and transcription processes are considerably different from those with conventional DNA lesions. Thus, DPCs are formidable challenges to maintaining genome integrity and faithful gene expression. Current models of DPC repair involve direct and indirect removal of DPCs. The direct mechanism works for DPCs that contain topoisomerase 2 attached to the 5\u2032 end of DNA. The Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex cleaves the site internal to the DPC and directly releases a DPC-containing oligonucleotide. The indirect mechanism involves degradation of cross-linked proteins by proteasomes or the recently identified DPC proteases Wss1 and Sprtn to relieve steric hindrance of DPCs. The resulting peptide\u2013cross-links might be processed by translesion synthesis or other canonical repair mechanisms: however, the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated.",

     "abstract": "DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are a specific type of DNA lesion consisting of a protein covalently and irreversibly bound to DNA, which arise after exposure to physical and chemical crosslinking agents. DPCs can be bulky and thereby pose a barrier to DNA replication and transcription. The persistence of DPCs during S phase causes DNA replication stress and genome instability. The toxicity of DPCs is exploited in cancer therapy: many common chemotherapeutics kill cancer cells by inducing DPC formation.Recent work from several laboratories discovered a specialized repair pathway for DPCs, namely DPC proteolysis (DPCP) repair. DPCP repair is carried out by replication-coupled DNA-dependent metalloproteases: Wss1 in yeast and SPRTN in metazoans. Mutations in SPRTN cause premature ageing and liver cancer in humans and mice; thus, defective DPC repair has great clinical ramifications. In the present review, we will revise the current knowledge on the mechanisms of DPCP repair and on the regulation of DPC protease activity, while highlighting the most significant unresolved questions in the field.

As replication is halted in sporulating B. subtilis cells, in this report, we investigated if this response may result from an error-prone repair event involving the UV-endonuclease YwjD and low fidelity (LF) DNA synthesis. Accordingly, disruption of YwjD generated B. subtilis sporangia that were more susceptible to UV-C radiation than sporangia of the WT strain and such susceptibility increased even more after the single or simultaneous inactivation of the LF DNA polymerases YqjH and YqjW. To further explore this concept, functional His6-tagged YwjD and Y-DNA polymerases YqjH and YqjW were produced and purified to homogeneity. In vitro repair assays showed that YwjD hydrolyzed the phosphodiester bond immediately located 5\u00b4-end of a ds-DNA substrate bearing either, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD), 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PD) or Dewar isomers (DWI). Notably, the 6-4 PD and DWI but not the CPDs repair intermediaries of YwjD were efficiently processed by the LF polymerase YqjH suggesting that an additional 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 exonuclease event was necessary to process PD. Accordingly, the LF polymerase YqjW efficiently processed the incision-excision repair products derived from YwjD and exonuclease YpcP attack over CPD-containing DNA.

Disruptions in DNA repair pathways can result in the accumulation of DNA mutations, which may lead to onset of complex disease such as cancer. The discovery and characterization of cancer-related biomarkers may allow early diagnosis and targeted treatment, which could significantly contribute to the survival rates of cancer patients. To this end, we have applied a hypothesis driven bioinformatics approach to identify biomarkers related to 25 different DNA repair enzymes, in combination with structural analysis of six selected missense mutations of newly discovered SNPs that are associated with cancer phenotypes. Our search on 8 distinct cancer databases uncovered 43 missense SNPs that statistically significantly associated at least one phenotype. Moreover, nine of these missense SNPs are statistically significantly associated with two or more cancers. In addition, we have performed classical molecular dynamics to characterize the impact of rs10018786 on POLN, which results in the M310\u2009L Pol \u03bd variant, and rs3218784 on POLI, which results in the I236\u2009M Pol \u03b9.

Cells were transfected with DNA constructs harboring a herpes tk gene (the \u201crecipient\u201d) rendered non-functional by an oligonucleotide containing the recognition site for endonuclease I-SceI. Constructs also contained a \u201cdonor\u201d tk sequence that could restore function to the recipient gene through spontaneous gene conversion or via repair of a double-strand break (DSB) at the I-SceI site. Recombination events were recoverable by selection for tk-positive clones. Three different donors were used containing 16, 25, or 33 mismatches relative to the recipient. The mismatches were clustered, forming an interval of \u201chomeology\u201d relative to the recipient sequences. We show that when homeologous sequences were surrounded by high homology, mismatches were frequently included in gene conversion events. Notably, conversion tracts from spontaneous recombination included either all or none of the mismatches, suggesting that recombination must begin and end in high homology. This requirement was relaxed for events that occurred near an induced DSB, as a significant number of these latter conversion tracts had one end positioned within homeology. Knock-down of mismatch repair showed that incorporation of mismatches into gene conversion tracts can involve repair of mismatched heteroduplex intermediates, indicating that mismatch repair does not necessarily impede homeologous genetic exchange. Our results illustrate (1) genetic exchange between homeologous sequences in a mammalian genome is enabled by nearby homology, (2) proximity to a DSB impacts the homology requirements for where genetic exchange may begin and end, and (3) mismatch correction and previously documented anti-recombination activity are separable functions of the mismatch repair machinery in mammalian cells.",

     "abstract": "Bacterial chromosome duplication is initiated at a single origin (oriC). Two forks are assembled and proceed in opposite directions with high speed and processivity until they fuse and terminate in a specialised area opposite to oriC. Proceeding forks are often blocked by tightly-bound protein-DNA complexes, topological strain or various DNA lesions. In Escherichia coli the RecBCD protein complex is a key player in the processing of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) ends. It has important roles in the repair of dsDNA breaks and the restart of forks stalled at sites of replication-transcription conflicts. In addition, \u0394recB cells show substantial amounts of DNA degradation in the termination area. In this study we show that head-on encounters of replication and transcription at a highly-transcribed rrn operon expose fork structures to degradation by nucleases such as SbcCD. SbcCD is also mostly responsible for the degradation in the termination area of \u0394recB cells. However, additional processes exacerbate degradation specifically in this location. Replication profiles from \u0394recB cells in which the chromosome is linearized at two different locations highlight that the location of replication termination can have some impact on the degradation observed. Our data improve our understanding of the role of RecBCD at sites of replication-transcription conflicts as well as the final stages of chromosome duplication. However, they also highlight that current models are insufficient and cannot explain all the molecular details in cells lacking RecBCD.",

     "abstract": "Lifelong mammalian male fertility is maintained through an intricate balance between spermatogonial proliferation and differentiation. DNA damage in spermatogonia, for instance caused by chemo- or radiotherapy, can induce cell cycle arrest or germ cell apoptosis, possibly resulting in male infertility. Spermatogonia are generally more radiosensitive and prone to undergo apoptosis than somatic cells. Among spermatogonial subtypes the response to DNA damage is differentially modulated; undifferentiated spermatogonia, including the spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), are relatively radio-resistant, whereas differentiating spermatogonia are very radiosensitive. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying this difference, we used an in vitro system consisting of mouse male germline stem (GS) cells that can be induced to differentiate. Using RNA-sequencing analysis, we analyzed the response of undifferentiated and differentiating GS cells to ionizing radiation (IR). At the RNA expression level, both undifferentiated and differentiating GS cells showed a very similar response to IR. Protein localization of several genes found to be involved in either spermatogonial differentiation or radiation response was investigated using mouse testis sections. For instance, we found that the transcription factor PDX1 was specifically expressed in undifferentiated spermatogonia and thus may be a novel marker for these cells. Interestingly, also at the protein level, undifferentiated GS cells showed a more pronounced upregulation of p53 in response to IR than differentiating GS cells. The higher p53 protein level in undifferentiated spermatogonia may preferentially induce cell cycle arrest, thereby giving these cells more time to repair inflicted DNA damage and increase their radio-resistance.",

Substitution of Mg2+ with Mn2+ stimulates the TLS activity of PrimPol and allows for efficient, but error-prone, synthesis on DNA templates containing all tested DNA lesions, including thymine glycol and 1,N6-ethenoadenine.

     "abstract": "In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the DEF1 gene is responsible for regulation of many cellular processes including ubiquitin-dependent degradation of DNA metabolism proteins. Recently it has been proposed that Def1 promotes degradation of the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase \u03b4 at sites of DNA damage and regulates a switch to specialized polymerases and, as a consequence, DNA-damage induced mutagenesis. The idea was based substantially on the severe defects in induced mutagenesis observed in the def1 mutants. We describe that UV mutability of def1\u0394 strains is actually only moderately affected, while the virtual absence of UV mutagenesis in many def1\u0394 clones is caused by a novel phenotype of the def1 mutants, proneness to self-diploidization. Diploids are extremely frequent (90%) after transformation of wild-type haploids with def1::kanMX disruption cassette and are frequent (2.3%) in vegetative haploid def1 cultures. Such diploids look \u201cUV immutable\u201d when assayed for recessive forward mutations but have normal UV mutability when assayed for dominant reverse mutations. The propensity for frequent self-diploidization in def1\u0394 mutants should be taken into account in studies of the def1\u0394 effect on mutagenesis. The true haploids with def1\u0394 mutation are moderately UV sensitive but retain substantial UV mutagenesis for forward mutations: they are fully proficient at lower doses and only partially defective at higher doses of UV. We conclude that Def1 does not play a critical role in damage-induced mutagenesis.",

Previously, we designed an assay for detecting NHEJ activity by using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system, however, this approach cannot be used to predict the activity of HR repair. Hence, we developed a novel method that is capable of quantitatively measuring both HR and NHEJ activities via CRISPR/Cas9-induced oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN)-mediated DSB repair. In the present experimental procedures, the CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid was cotransfected with single-stranded ODN (ssODN) or blunt-ended double-stranded ODN (dsODN), both of which harbored a unique marker sequence. After the induction of site-specific DSBs by CRISPR/Cas9 system, the ssODN, functioned as the donor template for HR repair, could insert the marker sequence into the DSB sites, while the dsODN was embedded in the DSB sites through NHEJ pathway. Next, by means of PCR analysis using a specific primer for the marker sequence and the primers that flank the DSB sites, the relative amount of integrated marker sequence in the genomic DNA could be quantitatively determined. The correlation between the marker sequence abundance and the HR and NHEJ activities was confirmed by using the selective HR and NHEJ inhibitors. This accessible and rapid quantitative assay for HR and NHEJ activities might be useful for the future research of the DSB repair mechanisms.",

Genome-wide association studies have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vicinity of the FAN1 (MIM* 613534) gene that are associated with variations in the age at onset of a number of Repeat Expansion Diseases. FAN1 is a nuclease that has both 5\u2032-3\u2032 exonuclease and 5\u2032 flap endonuclease activities.

In addition, only 60.24% (95% CI: 49.65%\u201370.83%) of the somatic SNVs called from normal blood by WXS were found in those called from normal solid tissue tested by WXS / WGS, while 31.78% (95%CI: 4.14%\u201359.42%) of the somatic SNVs called from normal tissue adjacent to primary by WXS were found in those from normal blood tested by WXS / WGS. These findings suggested that more representative types of normal tissues should be included in detection of cancer-associated somatic mutations.",

We have analyzed coevolution of physicochemical properties in pairs of amino acid residues in the formamidopyrimidine\u2013DNA glycosylase (Fpg) protein family, identified three conserved polar bridges (Arg54\u2013Glu131, Gln234\u2013Arg244, and Tyr170\u2013Ser208 in the E. coli protein) located in known functional regions of the protein, and analyzed their roles by site-directed mutagenesis. The structure and molecular dynamic modeling showed that the coevolving pairs do not form isolated bridges but rather participate in tight local clusters of hydrogen bonds. The Arg54\u2013Glu131 bridge, connecting the N- and C-terminal domains, was important for DNA binding, as its abolishment or even ion pair reversal inactivated Fpg and greatly decreased the enzyme\u2019s affinity for DNA. Mutations of the Gln234\u2013Arg244 bridge, located at the base of the single Fpg \u03b2-hairpin zinc finger, did not affect the activity but sharply decreased the melting temperature of the protein, with the bridge reversal partially restoring the thermal stability. Finally, Tyr170 mutation to Phe decreased Fpg binding but did not fully inactivate the protein, whereas Ser208 replacement with Ala had no effect; molecular dynamics showed that in both wild-type and S208\u202fA Fpg, Tyr170 quickly re-orients to form an alternative set of hydrogen bonds. Thus, the coevolution analysis approach, combined with biochemical and computational studies, provides a powerful tool for understanding intramolecular interactions important for the function of DNA repair enzymes.",

To assess the consequences of PNKP deficiency for NHEJ of 3\u2032-phosphate-ended DSBs, PNKP-deficient derivatives of HCT116 and of HeLa cells were generated using CRISPR/CAS9. For both cell lines, PNKP deficiency conferred sensitivity to ionizing radiation as well as to neocarzinostatin (NCS), which specifically induces DSBs bearing protruding 3\u2032-phosphate termini. Moreover, NCS-induced DSBs, detected as 53BP1 foci, were more persistent in PNKP \u2212/\u2212 HCT116 cells compared to their wild-type (WT) counterparts. Surprisingly, PNKP-deficient whole-cell and nuclear extracts were biochemically competent in removing both protruding and recessed 3\u2032-phosphates from synthetic DSB substrates, albeit much less efficiently than WT extracts, suggesting an alternative 3\u2032-phosphatase.

     "abstract": "It is well established that inflammation leads to the creation of potent DNA damaging chemicals, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Nitric oxide can react with glutathione to create S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), which can in turn lead to S-nitrosated proteins. Of particular interest is the impact of GSNO on the function of DNA repair enzymes. The base excision repair (BER) pathway can be initiated by the alkyl-adenine DNA glycosylase (AAG), a monofunctional glycosylase that removes methylated bases. After base removal, an abasic site is formed, which then gets cleaved by AP endonuclease and processed by downstream BER enzymes. Interestingly, using the Fluorescence-based Multiplexed Host Cell Reactivation Assay (FM-HCR), we show that GSNO actually enhances AAG activity, which is consistent with the literature. This raised the possibility that there might be imbalanced BER when cells are challenged with a methylating agent. To further explore this possibility, we confirmed that GSNO can cause AP endonuclease to translocate from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, which might further exacerbate imbalanced BER by increasing the levels of AP sites. Analysis of abasic sites indeed shows GSNO induces an increase in the level of AP sites. Furthermore, analysis of DNA damage using the CometChip (a higher throughput version of the comet assay) shows an increase in the levels of BER intermediates. Finally, we found that GSNO exposure is associated with an increase in methylation-induced cytotoxicity. Taken together, these studies support a model wherein GSNO increases BER initiation while processing of AP sites is decreased, leading to a toxic increase in BER intermediates. This model is also supported by additional studies performed in our laboratory showing that inflammation in vivo leads to increased large-scale sequence rearrangements. Taken together, this work provides new evidence that inflammatory chemicals can drive cytotoxicity and mutagenesis via BER imbalance.",

Arrested replication is rescued by translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and homologous recombination (HR)-mediated template switching.

Here we show that SPARTAN promotes diversification of the chicken DT40 immunoglobulin-variable \u03bb gene by facilitating TLS-mediated hypermutation and template switch-mediated gene-conversion, both induced by replication blocks at abasic sites. SPARTAN-/- and SPARTAN-/-/Pol\u03b7-/-/Pol\u03b6-/- cells showed defective and similar decrease in hypermutation rates, as well as alterations in the mutation spectra, with decreased dG-to-dC transversions and increased dG-to-dA transitions.

Notably, SPARTAN\u2019s ubiquitin-binding zinc-finger 4 domain, but not the PCNA interacting peptide domain or its DNA-binding domain, was specifically required for the promotion of immunoglobulin gene-conversion, while all these three domains were shown to contribute similarly to TLS.

     "abstract": "The ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler CSB is implicated in a variety of different DNA repair mechanisms, including transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER), base excision repair and DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. However, how CSB is regulated in these various repair processes is not well understood. Here we report that the first 30 amino acids of CSB along with two phosphorylation events on S10 and S158, previously reported to be required for CSB function in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair, are dispensable for repairing UV-induced DNA damage, suggesting that the regulation of CSB in these two types of repair are carried out by distinct mechanisms. In addition, we show that although the central ATPase domain of CSB is engaged in interactions with both the N- and C-terminal regions, these interactions are disrupted following UV-induced DNA damage. The UV-induced disengagement of the C-terminal region of CSB from the ATPase domain requires two conserved amino acids W1486 and L1488, which are thought to contribute to the hydrophobic core formation of the winged helix domain (WHD) at its C-terminus. Failure to undergo UV-induced dissociation of the C-terminal region of CSB from the ATPase domain is associated with impairment in its UV-induced chromatin association, its UV-induced post-translational modification as well as cell survival. Collectively, these findings suggest that UV-induced dissociation of CSB domain interactions is a necessary step in repairing UV-induced DNA damage and that the WHD of CSB plays a key role in this dissociation.",

     "abstract": "Classical non-homologous end-joining (cNHEJ) is the main pathway for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in mammalian cells. In the absence of c-NHEJ, an alternative end-joining (A-EJ) mechanism resolves DSBs. To date, no A-EJ specific factor has been identified. Instead, this mechanism appears to co-opt proteins involved in more than one DNA repair pathway. These include components of base-excision repair (PARP1/XRCC1/LIG3), interstrand cross-link repair (BRCA1/FANCD2), and DSB response/DNA end-resection (MRE11A/RAD50/RBBP8). To clarify the contribution of these factors to A-EJ, here we examined their expression and recruitment to DSBs in correlation with surrogates of cNHEJ (53BP1) and homologous recombination (RAD51) in cells deficient for the cNHEJ end-ligation component XRCC4. This revealed XRCC4-deficient cells exhibited marked increases in the stability of A-EJ transcripts that result in correspondingly elevated levels of associated proteins, in comparison to WT cells. RAD51 was also increased while 53BP1 was unaffected. Treatment with radiomimetic DSB-inducing drug doxorubicin did not influence these activities. However, FANCD2, BRCA1 and XRCC1 foci, prominently associated with 53BP1 foci and hence DSBs resolved by cNHEJ, were only detected in doxorubicin-treated XRCC4-deficient cells. Strikingly, treatment of XRCC4-deficient cells with the PARP-specific inhibitor Niraparib enhanced A-EJ, and substantially induced 53BP1 transcripts and the numbers of A-EJ-associated 53BP1 DNA damage foci. RAD51 was severely inhibited, and upstream cNHEJ (KU70/KU80/DNA-PKCs/ARTEMIS) transcripts were substantially induced. These latter results were recapitulated in BRCA1-deficient cells, which contrastingly did not affect 53BP1 or PARP1 status irrespective of doxorubicin or Niraparib treatment. Hence A-EJ is regulated transcriptionally, reduced by a higher turnover rate in cNHEJ-proficient cells and sustained but fine-tuned by PARP1 in XRCC4-deficient cells to promote DNA repair and survival. Upstream cNHEJ components are similarly transcriptionally down-modulated by PARP1 and BRCA1 in a manner inversely correlated with HR and mechanistically distinct from A-EJ respectively in cNHEJ-deficient and cNHEJ-proficient settings.",

DNA excision during MMR is initiated at single-strand breaks (SSBs) in vitro, and several redundant processes have been observed in reconstituted systems which either require a pre-formed SSB in the DNA or require a mismatch-activated nicking endonuclease to introduce a SSB in order to initiate MMR. However, the conditions under which each of these processes may actually occur in living cells have remained obscured by the limitations of current MMR assays.

     "abstract": "Posttranslational modifications of DNA repair proteins have been linked to their function. However, it is not clear if posttranslational acetylation affects subcellular localization of these enzymes. Here, we show that the human DNA glycosylase NEIL1, which is involved in repair of both endo- and exogenously generated oxidized bases via the base excision repair (BER) pathway, is acetylated by histone acetyltransferase p300. Acetylation occurs predominantly at Lys residues 296, 297 and 298 located in NEIL1\u2019s disordered C-terminal domain. NEIL1 mutant having the substitution of Lys 296\u2013298 with neutral Ala loses nuclear localization, whereas Lys\u202f>\u202fArg substitution (in 3KR mutant) at the same sites does not affect NEIL1\u2019s nuclear localization or chromatin binding, presumably due to retention of the positive charge. Although non-acetylated NEIL1 can bind to chromatin, acetylated NEIL1 is exclusively chromatin-bound. NEIL1 acetylation while dispensable for its glycosylase activity enhances it due to increased product release. The acetylation-defective 3KR mutant forms less stable complexes with various chromatin proteins, including histone chaperones and BER/single-strand break repair partners, than the wild-type (WT) NEIL1. We also showed that the repair complex with WT NEIL1 has significantly higher BER activity than the 3KR mutant complex. This is consistent with reduced resistance of non-acetylable mutant NEIL1 expressing cells to oxidative stress relative to cells expressing the acetylable WT enzyme. We thus conclude that the major role of acetylable Lys residues in NEIL1 is to stabilize the formation of chromatin-bound repair complexes which protect cells from oxidative stress.",

We focus on the splicing complex SF3B and show that its depletion impairs DNA end resection and hampers homologous recombination. Functionally, SF3B controls CtIP function at, as least, two levels: by affecting CtIP mRNA levels and controlling CtIP recruitment to DNA breaks, in a way that requires ATM-mediated phosphorylation of SF3B2 at serine 289. Indeed, overexpression of CtIP rescues the resection defect caused by SF3B downregulation. Strikingly, other SF3B depletion phenotypes, such as impaired homologous recombination or cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, are independent of CtIP levels, suggesting a more general role of SF3B in controlling the response to chromosome breaks.",

Assessment of DNA adducts in cells and tissues is critical for genotoxic and carcinogenic evaluation of chemical exposure and may provide insight into the etiology of cancer. Numerous methods to characterize the formation of DNA adducts and their retention for risk assessment have been developed. However, there are still significant drawbacks to the implementation and wide-spread use of these methods, because they often require a substantial amount of biological sample, highly specialized expertise and equipment, and depending on technique, may be limited to the detection and quantification of only a handful of DNA adducts at a time. There is a pressing need for high throughput, easy to implement assays that can assess a broad spectrum of DNA lesions, allowing for faster evaluation of chemical exposures and assessment of the retention of adducts in biological samples. Here, we describe a new methodology, Repair Assisted Damage Detection (RADD), which utilizes a DNA damage processing repair enzyme cocktail to detect and modify sites of DNA damage for a subsequent gap filling reaction that labels the DNA damage sites. This ability to detect and label a broad spectrum of DNA lesions within cells, offers a novel and easy to use tool for assessing levels of DNA damage in cells that have been exposed to environmental agents or have natural variations in DNA repair capacity.",

     "abstract": "Head and neck cancer (HNC), the sixth most common cancer globally, stands second in India. In Northeast (NE) India, it is the sixth most common cause of death in males and seventh in females. Prolonged tobacco and alcohol consumption constitute the major etiological factors for HNC development, which induce DNA damage. Therefore, DNA repair pathway is a crucial system in maintaining genomic integrity and preventing carcinogenesis. The present work was aimed to predict the consequence of significant germline variants of the DNA repair genes in disease predisposition. Whole exome sequencing was performed in Ion Proton\u2122 platform on 15 case-control samples from the HNC-prevalent states of Manipur, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Variant annotation was done in Ion Reporter\u2122 as well as wANNOVAR. Subsequent statistical and bioinformatics analysis identified significant exonic and intronic variants associated with HNC. Amongst our observed variants, 78.6% occurred in ExAC, 94% reported in dbSNP and 5.8% & 9.3% variants were present in ClinVar and HGMD, respectively. The total variants were dispersed among 199 genes with DSBR and FA pathway being the most mutated pathways. The allelic association test suggested that the intronic variants in HLTF and RAD52 gene significantly associated (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) with the risk (OR\u202f>\u202f5), while intronic variants in PARP4, RECQL5, EXO1 and PER1 genes and exonic variant in TDP2 gene showed protection (OR\u202f<\u202f1) for HNC. MDR analysis proposed the exonic variants in MSH6, BRCA2, PALB2 and TP53 genes and intronic variant in RECQL5 genetic region working together during certain phase of DNA repair mechanism for HNC causation. In addition, other intronic and 3\u2032UTR variations caused modifications in the transcription factor binding sites and miRNA target sites associated with HNC. Large-scale validation in NE Indian population, in-depth structure prediction and subsequent simulation of our recognized polymorphisms is necessary to identify true causal variants related to HNC.",

     "abstract": "Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) is an ubiquitous DNA repair enzyme present in yeast, plants and animals. It removes a broad range of blocking lesions at the ends of DNA breaks. The catalytic core of TDP1 consists in a pair of conserved histidine-lysine-asparagine (HKN) motifs. Analysis of the human TDP1 (hTDP1) crystal structure reveals potential involvement of additional residues that shape the substrate binding site. In this biochemical study, we analyzed four such conserved residues, tyrosine 204 (Y204), phenylalanine 259 (F259), serine 400 (S400) and tryptophan 590 (W590). We show that the F259 residue of hTDP1 is critical for both 3\u2032- and 5\u2032-phosphodiesterase catalysis. We propose that the double \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions of the F259 residue with the \u22122 and \u22123 nucleobases serve to position the nucleopeptide substrate in phase with the active site histidines of hTDP1. Mutating Y204 of hTDP1 to phenylalanine (Y204F), as in fly and yeast TDP1 enzymes, had minor impact on TDP1 activity. In constrast, we find that S400 enhances 3\u2032-processing activity while it suppresses 5\u2032-processing activity, thereby promoting specificity for 3\u2032-substrates. W590 is selectively important for 5\u2032-processing. These results reveal the impact of conserved amino acid residues that participate in defining the DNA binding groove around the dual HKN catalytic core motif of TDP1, and their differential roles in facilitating the 3\u2032- vs 5\u2032-end processing activities of hTDP1.",

This enzyme plays a pivotal role in the control of a number of fundamental cellular processes by phosphorylating its downstream substrates. In addition to its role in the cytoplasm, it is well documented that PAK1 also plays crucial roles in the nucleus participating in mitotic events and gene expression through its association and/or phosphorylation of several transcription factors, transcriptional co-regulators and cell cycle-related proteins, including Aurora kinase A (AURKA), polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1), the forkhead transcription factor (FKHR), estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1), and Snail. More recently, PAK signaling has emerged as a component of the DNA damage response (DDR) as PAK1 activity influences the cellular sensitivity to ionizing radiation and promotes the expression of several genes involved in the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA pathway.

     "abstract": "Plant mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes encode essential proteins for oxidative phosphorylation and photosynthesis. For proper cellular function, plant organelles must ensure genome integrity. Although plant organelles repair damaged DNA using the multi-enzyme Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway, the details of this pathway in plant organelles are largely unknown. The initial enzymatic steps in BER produce a 5\u2032-deoxyribose phosphate (5\u2032-dRP) moiety that must be removed to allow DNA ligation and in plant organelles, the enzymes responsible for the removal of a 5\u2032-dRP group are unknown. In metazoans, DNA polymerases (DNAPs) remove the 5\u2032-dRP moiety using their intrinsic lyase and/or strand-displacement activities during short or long-patch BER sub-pathways, respectively. The plant model Arabidopsis thaliana encodes two family-A DNAPs paralogs, AtPolIA and AtPolIB, which are the sole DNAPs in plant organelles identified to date. Herein we demonstrate that both AtPolIs present 5\u2032-dRP lyase activities. AtPolIB performs efficient strand-displacement on a BER-associated 1-nt gap DNA substrate, whereas AtPolIA exhibits only moderate strand-displacement activity. Both lyase and strand-displacement activities are dependent on an amino acid insertion that is exclusively present in plant organellar DNAPs. Within this insertion, we identified that residue AtPollB-Lys593 acts as nucleophile for lyase activity. Our results demonstrate that AtPolIs are functionally equipped to play a role in short-patch BER and suggest a major role of AtPolIB in a predicted long-patch BER sub-pathway. We propose that the acquisition of insertion 1 in the polymerization domain of AtPolIs was a key component in their evolution as BER associated and replicative DNAPs.",

ROS cause harmful damage to DNA bases that could result in mutagenesis and various diseases, if not properly repaired. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is the primary pathway involved in maintaining the integrity of mtDNA. Several enzymes that partake in BER within the nucleus have also been identified in the mitochondria. The nei-like (NEIL) DNA glycosylases initiate BER by excising oxidized pyrimidine bases and others such as the ring-opened formamidopyrimidine and the hydantoin lesions. During BER, the NEIL enzymes interact with proteins that are involved with DNA replication and transcription. In the current manuscript, we detected NEIL1 in purified mitochondrial extracts from human cells and showed that NEIL1 interacts with the human mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein (mtSSB) via its C-terminal tail using protein painting, far-western analysis, and gel-filtration chromatography. Finally, we scrutinized the NEIL1-mtSSB interaction in the presence and absence of a partial-duplex DNA substrate using a combination of multi-angle light scattering (MALS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). The data indicate that NEIL1 and homotetrameric mtSSB form a larger ternary complex in presence of DNA, however, the tetrameric form of mtSSB gets disrupted by NEIL1 in the absence of DNA as revealed by the formation of a smaller NEIL1-mtSSBmonomer complex.",

We describe here an experimental in vitro system allowing the specific analysis of BER in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We show that C. reinhardtii cell-free extracts contain the enzymatic machinery required to perform BER of ubiquitous DNA lesions, such as uracil and abasic sites. Our results also reveal that repair can occur by both single-nucleotide insertion and long-patch DNA synthesis.

These processes are strictly controlled and regulated to maintain DNA integrity and to mature or recycle various RNAs. NanoRNase (Nrn) is a 3\u2032-exonuclease that specifically degrades nanoRNAs shorter than 5 nucleotides. Several Nrns have been identified and characterized in bacteria, mainly in Firmicutes. Archaea often grow in extreme environments and might be subjected to more damage to DNA/RNA, so DNA repair and recycling of damaged RNA are very important in archaea. There is no report on the identification and characterization of Nrn in archaea. Aeropyrum pernix encodes three potential Nrns: NrnA (Ape1437), NrnB (Ape0124), and an Nrn-like protein Ape2190. Biochemical characterization showed that only Ape0124 could degrade ssDNA and ssRNA from the 3\u2032-end in the presence of Mn2+. Interestingly, unlike bacterial Nrns, Ape0124 prefers ssDNA, including short nanoDNA, and degrades nanoRNA with lower efficiency. The 3\u2032-DNA backbone was found to be required for efficiently hydrolyzing the phosphodiester bonds. In addition, Ape0124 also degrads the 3\u2032-overhang of double-stranded DNA. Interestingly, Ape0124 could hydrolyze pAp into AMP, which is a feature of bacterial NrnA, not NrnB. Our results indicate that Ape0124 is a novel Nrn with a combined substrate profile of bacterial NrnA and NrnB.",

DNA base lesions including both base and nucleoside modifications were measured using gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with isotope-dilution in DNA samples isolated from leukocytes of euthymic patients with bipolar disorder (n\u202f=\u202f32) and healthy individuals (n\u202f=\u202f51).

Seven DNA base lesions in DNA of leukocytes of patients and healthy individuals were identified and quantified.

The level of OGG1 expression was significantly reduced in bipolar patients compared to healthy individuals, whereas the two groups exhibited similar levels of NEIL1 expression.

     "abstract": "Telomeres, the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, consist of repetitive DNA sequences and their bound proteins that protect the end from the DNA damage response. Short telomeres with fewer repeats are preferentially elongated by telomerase. Tel1, the yeast homolog of human ATM kinase, is preferentially recruited to short telomeres and Tel1 kinase activity is required for telomere elongation. Rif1, a telomere-binding protein, negatively regulates telomere length by forming a complex with two other telomere binding proteins, Rap1 and Rif2, to block telomerase recruitment. Rif1 has 14 SQ/TQ consensus phosphorylation sites for ATM kinases, including 6 in a SQ/TQ Cluster Domain (SCD) similar to other DNA damage response proteins. These 14 sites were analyzed as N-terminal, SCD and C-terminal domains. Mutating some sites to non-phosphorylatable residues increased telomere length in cells lacking Tel1 while a different set of phosphomimetic mutants increased telomere length in cells lacking Rif2, suggesting that Rif1 phosphorylation has both positive and negative effects on length regulation. While these mutations did not alter the sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, inducing telomere-specific damage by growing cells lacking YKU70 at high temperature revealed a role for the SCD. Mass spectrometry of Rif1 from wild type cells or those induced for telomere-specific DNA damage revealed increased phosphorylation in cells with telomere damage at an ATM consensus site in the SCD, S1351, and non-ATM sites S181 and S1637. A phosphomimetic rif1-S1351E mutation caused an increase in telomere length at synthetic telomeres but not natural telomeres. These results indicate that the Rif1 SCD can modulate Rif1 function. As all Rif1 orthologs have one or more SCD domains, these results for yeast Rif1 have implications for the regulation of Rif1 function in humans and other organisms.",

     "abstract": "How DNA lesions in nucleosomes are recognized for global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) remains poorly understood, and the roles that histone tails may play remains to be established. Histone H3 and H4 N-terminal tails are of particular interest as their acetylation states are important in regulating nucleosomal functions in transcription, replication and repair. In particular the H3 tail has been the focus of recent attention as a site for the interaction with XPC, the GG-NER lesion recognition factor. Here we have investigated how the structure and dynamics of the DNA lesion cis-B[a]P-dG, derived from the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P), is impacted by the presence of flanking H3 and H4 tails. This lesion is well-repaired by GG-NER, and adopts a base-displaced/intercalated conformation in which the lesion partner C is displaced into the major groove. We used molecular dynamics simulations to obtain structural and dynamic characterizations for this lesion positioned in nucleosomal DNA so that it is bracketed by the H3 and H4 tails. The H4 tail was studied in unacetylated and acetylated states, while the H3 tail was unacetylated, its state when it binds XPC (Kakumu, Nakanishi et al., 2017). Our results reveal that upon acetylation, the H4 tail is released from the DNA surface; the H3 tail then forms a pocket that induces flipping and capture of the displaced lesion partner base C. This reveals synergistic effects of the behavior of the two tails. We hypothesize that the dual capability of the H3 tail to sense the displaced lesion partner base and to bind XPC could foster recognition of this lesion by XPC for initiation of GG-NER in nucleosomes.",

     "abstract": "When Fanconi Anemia (FA) proteins were depleted in human U2OS cells with integrated DNA repair reporters, we observed decreases in homologous recombination (HR), decreases in mutagenic non-homologous end joining (m-NHEJ) and increases in canonical NHEJ, which was independently confirmed by measuring V(D)J recombination. Furthermore, depletion of FA proteins resulted in reduced HR protein foci and increased NHEJ protein recruitment to replication-associated DSBs, consistent with our observation that the use of canonical NHEJ increases after depletion of FA proteins in cycling cells. FA-depleted cells and FA-mutant cells were exquisitely sensitive to a DNA-PKcs inhibitor (DNA-PKi) after sustaining replication-associated double strand breaks (DSBs). By contrast, after DNA interstrand crosslinks, DNA-PKi resulted in increased survival in FA-deficient cells, implying that NHEJ is contributing to lethality after crosslink repair. Our results suggest FA proteins inhibit NHEJ, since repair intermediates from crosslinks are rendered lethal by NHEJ. The implication is that bone marrow failure in FA could be triggered by naturally occurring DNA crosslinks, and DNA-PK inhibitors would be protective. Since some sporadic cancers have been shown to have deficiencies in the FA-pathway, these tumors should be vulnerable to NHEJ inhibitors with replication stress, but not with crosslinking agents, which could be tested in future clinical trials.",

     "abstract": "The base excision repair (BER) pathway consists of sequential action of DNA glycosylase and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease necessary to remove a damaged base and generate a single-strand break in duplex DNA. Human multifunctional AP endonuclease 1 (APE1, a.k.a. APEX1, HAP-1, or Ref-1) plays essential roles in BER by acting downstream of DNA glycosylases to incise a DNA duplex at AP sites and remove 3\u2032-blocking sugar moieties at DNA strand breaks. Human 8-oxoguanine-DNA glycosylase (OGG1), methyl-CpG-binding domain 4 (MBD4, a.k.a. MED1), and alkyl-N-purine-DNA glycosylase (ANPG, a.k.a. Aag or MPG) excise a variety of damaged bases from DNA. Here we demonstrated that the redox-deficient truncated APE1 protein lacking the first N-terminal 61 amino acid residues (APE1-N\u039461) cannot stimulate DNA glycosylase activities of OGG1, MBD4, and ANPG on duplex DNA substrates. Electron microscopy imaging of APE1\u2013DNA complexes revealed oligomerization of APE1 along the DNA duplex and APE1-mediated DNA bridging followed by DNA aggregation. APE1 polymerizes on both undamaged and damaged DNA in cooperative mode. Association of APE1 with undamaged DNA may enable scanning for damage; however, this event reduces effective concentration of the enzyme and subsequently decreases APE1-catalyzed cleavage rates on long DNA substrates. We propose that APE1 oligomers on DNA induce helix distortions thereby enhancing molecular recognition of DNA lesions by DNA glycosylases via a conformational proofreading/selection mechanism. Thus, APE1-mediated structural deformations of the DNA helix stabilize the enzyme\u2013substrate complex and promote dissociation of human DNA glycosylases from the AP site with a subsequent increase in their turnover rate.The major human apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease, APE1, stimulates DNA glycosylases by increasing their turnover rate on duplex DNA substrates. At present, the mechanism of the stimulation remains unclear. We report that the redox domain of APE1 is necessary for the active mode of stimulation of DNA glycosylases. Electron microscopy revealed that full-length APE1 oligomerizes on DNA possibly via cooperative binding to DNA. Consequently, APE1 shows DNA length dependence with preferential repair of short DNA duplexes. We propose that APE1-catalyzed oligomerization along DNA induces helix distortions, which in turn enable conformational selection and stimulation of DNA glycosylases. This new biochemical property of APE1 sheds light on the mechanism of redox function and its role in DNA repair.",

XRCC1, a multi-domain protein without catalytic activity, interacts with a number of known repair proteins including APTX, modulating and coordinating the various steps of DNA repair. CK2-phosphorylation of XRCC1 is thought to be crucial for its interaction with the FHA domain of APTX. In light of conflicting reports, the importance of XRCC1 phosphorylation and APTX function is not clear. In this study, a phosphorylation mutant of XRCC1 designed to eliminate APTX binding was stably expressed in Xrcc1\u2212/\u2212 cells. Analysis of APTX-GFP accumulation at micro-irradiation damage confirmed that phosphorylated XRCC1 is required for APTX recruitment. APTX-mediated DNA deadenylation activity (i.e., 5\u2032-AMP removal) was measured in extracts of cells expressing wild-type XRCC1 or the XRCC1 phosphorylation mutant, and compared with activity in APTX-deficient and APTX-complemented human cells. APTX activity was lower in extracts from Xrcc1\u2212/\u2212 and XRCC1 phosphorylation mutant cells compared to the robust activity in extract from wild-type XRCC1 expressing cells. Taken together, results verify that interaction with phosphorylated XRCC1 is a requirement for significant APTX recruitment to cellular DNA damage and enzymatic activity in cell extracts.",

By combining one of these three heterodimer-specific antibodies with a commercial anti-ERCC1 antibody (clone 4F9) unable to recognize the 204 isoform in a proximity ligation assay (PLA), we managed to specifically detect the functional ERCC1-202 isoform.

     "abstract": "It is widely accepted that, in chromosome-aberration induction, the (mis-)rejoining probability of two chromosome fragments depends on their initial distance, r. However, several aspects of these \u201cproximity effects\u201d need to be clarified, also considering that they can vary with radiation quality, cell type and dose. A previous work performed by the BIANCA (BIophysical ANalysis of Cell death and chromosome Aberrations) biophysical model has suggested that, in human lymphocytes and fibroblasts exposed to low-LET radiation, an exponential function of the form exp(-r/r0), which is consistent with free-end (confined) diffusion, describes proximity effects better than a Gaussian function.Herein, the investigation was extended to intermediate- and high-LET. Since the r0 values (0.8\u202f\u03bcm for lymphocytes and 0.7\u202f\u03bcm for fibroblasts) were taken from the low-LET study, the results were obtained by adjusting only one model parameter, i.e. the yield of \u201cCluster Lesions\u201d (CLs), where a CL was defined as a critical DNA damage producing two independent chromosome fragments. In lymphocytes, the exponential model allowed reproducing both dose-response curves for different aberrations (dicentrics, centric rings and excess acentrics), and values of F-ratio (dicentrics to centric rings) and G-ratio (interstitial deletions to centric rings). In fibroblasts, a good correspondence was found with the dose-response curves, whereas the G-ratio (and, to a lesser extent, the F-ratio) was underestimated. With increasing LET, F decreased and G increased in both cell types, supporting their role as \u201cfingerprints\u201d of high-LET exposure. A dose-dependence was also found at high LET, where F increased with dose and G decreased, possibly due to inter-track effects. We therefore conclude that, independent of radiation quality, in lymphocytes an exponential function can describe proximity effects at both inter- and intra-chromosomal level; on the contrary, in fibroblasts further studies (experimental and theoretical) are needed to explain the strong bias for intra-arm relative to inter-arm exchanges.",

     "abstract": "Deamination of adenine can occur spontaneously under physiological conditions to generate the highly mutagenic lesion, deoxyinosine (hypoxanthine deoxyribonucleotide, dI). In DNA, dI preferably pairs with cytosine rather than thymine and results in A:T to G:C transition mutations after DNA replication. The deamination of adenine is enhanced by ROS from exposure of DNA to ionizing radiation, UV light, nitrous acid, or heat. In Escherichia coli, dI repair is initiated by endonuclease V (endo\u2009V; nfi gene product) nicking but a complete repair mechanism has yet to be elucidated. Using in vitro minimum component reconstitution assays, we previously showed that endo V, DNA polymerase I (pol I), and E. coli DNA ligase were sufficient to repair this dI lesions efficiently and that the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease of pol I is essential. Here we employed a phagemid-based T-I substrate mimicking adenine deamination product to demonstrate pol I proofreading exonuclease is required by the endo V repair pathway both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo we found that the repair level of an nfi mutant (11%) was almost 8-fold lower than the wild type (87%). while the polA-D424A strain, a pol I mutant defective in 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease, showed a high repair level similar to wild type (both more than 80%). Using additional C\u2013C mismatch as strand discrimination marker we found that the high level of dI removal in polA-D424A was due to strand loss (more than 60%) associated with incomplete repair. Thus, pol I proofreading exonuclease is the major function responsible for dI lesion removal after endoV nicking both in vitro and in vivo. Finally, using MALDI-TOF to analyze single-nucleotide extension product we show that the pol I proofreading exonuclease excises only 2-nt 5\u2032 upstream of endo V incision site further honing the role of pol I in the endoV dI dependent repair pathway.",

Importantly, the monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 exhibit very different DNA binding modes. Here, we interrogate the functional differences between monomeric and dimeric forms of FAN1 and provide an explanation for the discrepancy in oligomeric state between the two hFAN1 structures. Specifically, we show that the flexible loop in question is needed for hFAN1 dimerization. While monomeric and dimeric bacterial or human FAN1 proteins cleave a short 5\u2032 flap strand with similar efficiency, optimal cleavage of a long 5\u2032 flap strand is contingent upon protein dimerization.

Inhibitors of specific DNA repair pathway can sensitize cancer cells to the treatment of chemotherapeutic drugs. In this paper we found that the effect of paclitaxel can be significantly improved when used in combination with FEN1 inhibitor SC13, suggesting a synergistic mechanism between the two compounds. Our studies suggest that FEN1 inhibition could be a novel strategy of tumor-targeting therapy for cervical cancer.

Within 30\u202fmin after 5\u202fGy irradiation of Spo11YF/YF mice, 140\u2013160 DSB repair foci were detected, which specifically localized to the synaptonemal complex axes. Repair of radiation-induced DSBs was incomplete in Spo11YF/YF compared to Spo11+/YF meiocytes. Still, repair of exogenous DSBs promoted partial recovery of chromosome pairing and synapsis in Spo11YF/YF meiocytes. This indicates that at least part of the exogenous DSBs can be processed in an interhomolog recombination repair pathway. Interestingly, in a seperate experiment, using 3\u202fGy of irradiation, we observed that Spo11/Hormad1 dko spermatocytes contained fewer remaining DSB repair foci at 48\u202fh after irradiation compared to irradiated Spo11 knockout spermatocytes. Together, these results show that recruitment of exogenous DSBs to the synaptonemal complex, in conjunction with repair of exogenous DSBs via the homologous chromosome, contributes to homology recognition.

Reproductive cell death (RCD), also known as clonogenic death, is an important mode of death of the cancer cells after radiotherapy. Although RCD induced by heavy-ion irradiation with various linear energy transfers has been demonstrated using clonogenic assay in vitro, little is known about the distribution of RCD across the range of heavy-ion irradiation at the level of whole organisms. In this study, a vulval tissue model of Caenorhabditis elegans was for the first time used to assess RCD in vivo induced by carbon-ion irradiation. A polymethyl methacrylate wedge was designed to provide a gradually varying thickness of shielding, so worms could be exposed to the entire range of carbon-ion irradiation. The carbon-ion irradiation led to a significant induction of RCD over the entire range in a dose-dependent manner. The biological peak did not correspond to the physical Bragg peak and moved forward, rather than spread forward, as radiation dose increased. The degree and shape of the range-distribution of RCD were also affected by the developmental stages of the worms. The gene mutations in DNA-damage checkpoints did not affect the responses of mutant worms positioned in biological peaks, compared to wild-type worms, but decreased radio-sensitivity in the entrance region. An increased induction of RCD was observed in the worms impaired in homologous recombination (HR), but not in non-homologous end jointing pathway, suggesting a crucial role of HR repair in vulval cells of C. elegans in dealing with the carbon-ion-induced DNA damage. These unique manifestations of RCD in vivo in response to carbon-ion irradiation might provide new clues for further investigating the biological effects of heavy-ion irradiation.",

We found collaboration among the factors. Notable were three findings. First, the ability of Gen1 to rescue hydroxyurea sensitivity of dysfunctional Blm requires the absence of Mus81. Second, the response of mutants defective in Blm and Gen1 to hydroxyurea challenge is markedly similar suggesting cooperation of these factors in the same pathway. Third, the repair proficiency of Brh2 mutant variants deleted of its N-terminal DNA binding region requires not only Rad52 but also Gen1 and Mus81.

It has been previously shown that a pre-stimulation with genotoxic agents improve NER efficiency of CPD, indicating a potential adaptive response of this repair pathway. We have pre-treated human dermal fibroblasts with repeated subletal low doses of UVB (chronic low-dose of UVB; CLUV) to determine whether it could enhance NER capacity to repair CPD. Our results show that CLUV pre-treatment greatly enhances CPD repair but have little effect on the repair of another UV-induced bypirimidine photoproduct, the pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4 PP). We have determined that the CLUV treatment activates p53 and we found an increase of DDB2 and XPC gene expression. This is consistent with an increasing level of NER recognition proteins, DDB2 and XPC, we found concentrated at the chromatin.

Tumours with somatic mutations in DNA mismatch-repair genes or in the proofreading domain of DNA polymerase \u03b5 (Pol \u03b5) exhibit more 5mC to T transitions than would be expected, given the kinetics of hydrolytic deamination. This enrichment is asymmetrical around replication origins with a preference for the leading strand template, in particular in methylated cytosines flanked by guanines (GCG). Notably, GCG to GTG mutations also exhibit strand asymmetry in mismatch-repair and Pol \u03b5 wild-type tumours.

     "abstract": "Yeast Cdc13 protein (related to human CTC1) maintains telomere stability by preventing 5\u2032-3\u2032 end resection. While Cdc13 and Yku70/Yku80 proteins appear to prevent excessive resection, their combined contribution to maintenance of telomere ends across the genome and their relative roles at specific ends of different chromosomes have not been addressable because Cdc13 and Yku70/Yku80 double mutants are sickly. Using our PFGE-shift approach where large resected molecules have slower pulse field gel electrophoresis mobilities, along with methods for maintaining viable double mutants, we address end-resection on most chromosomes as well as telomere end differences. In this global approach to looking at ends of most chromosomes, we identify chromosomes with 1-end resections and end-preferences. We also identify chromosomes with resection at both ends, previously not possible. 10\u201320% of chromosomes exhibit PFGE-shift when cdc13-1 cells are switched to restrictive temperature (37\u202f\u00b0C). In yku70\u0394 cdc13-1 mutants, there is a telomere resection \u201cstorm\u201d with approximately half the chromosomes experiencing at least 1-end resection, \u223c10\u202fkb/telomere, due to exonuclease1 and many exhibiting 2-end resection. Unlike for random internal chromosome breaks, resection of telomere ends is not coordinated. Telomere restitution at permissive temperature is rapid (<1\u202fh) in yku70\u0394 cdc13-1 cells. Surprisingly, survival can be high although strain background dependent. Given large amount of resected telomeres, we examined associated proteins. Up to 90% of cells have \u22651 Rfa1 (RPA) focus and 60% have multiple foci when \u223c30-40 telomeres/cell are resected. The ends are dispersed in the nucleus suggesting wide distribution of resected telomeres across nuclear space. The previously reported Rad52 nuclear centers of repair for random DSBs also appear in cells with many resected telomere ends, suggesting a Rad52 commonality to the organization of single strand ends and/or limitation on interactions of single-strand ends with Rad52.",

     "abstract": "DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) are complex DNA lesions that induce mutagenesis and cell death. DPCs are created by common antitumor drugs, reactive oxygen species, and endogenous aldehydes. Since these agents create other types of DNA damage in addition to DPCs, identification of the mechanisms of DPC repair is challenging. In this study, we created plasmid substrates containing site-specific DPC lesions, as well as plasmids harboring lesions that are selectively repaired by the base excision or nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathways. These substrates were transfected into mammalian cells and a quantitative real-time PCR assay employed to study their repair. This assay revealed that DPC lesions were rapidly repaired in wild-type human and Chinese hamster derived cells, as were plasmids harboring an oxoguanine residue (base excision repair substrate) or cholesterol lesion (NER substrate). Interestingly, the DPC substrate was repaired in human cells nearly three times as efficiently as in Chinese hamster cells (>75% vs \u223c25% repair at 8\u202fh post-transfection), while there was no significant species-specific difference in the efficiency with which the cholesterol lesion was repaired (\u223c60% repair). Experiments revealed that both human and hamster cells deficient in NER due to mutations in the xeroderma pigmentosum A or D genes were five to ten-fold less able to repair the cholesterol and DPC lesions than were wild-type control clones, and that both the global genome and transcription-coupled sub-pathways of NER were capable of repairing DPCs. In addition, analyses using this PCR-based assay revealed that a 4\u202fkDa peptide DNA crosslink was repaired nearly twice as efficiently as was a \u223c38\u202fkDa DPC, suggesting that proteolytic degradation of crosslinked proteins occurs during DPC repair. These results highlight the utility of this PCR-based assay to study DNA repair and indicate that the NER machinery rapidly and efficiently repairs plasmid DPC lesions in mammalian cells.",

It is a robust mitochondrial deacetylase; however, few studies have indicated its nuclear functions. Here we report interaction of SIRT3 with core histones and identified acetylated histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56ac) as its novel substrate, in addition to known substrates acetylated H4K16 and H3K9. Further, we showed in response to DNA damage SIRT3 localizes to the repair foci colocalizing with \u03b3H2AX and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) marker p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1). However, it does not colocalize with homologous repair (HR) marker BRCA1. By ChIP break assay, we demonstrated the recruitment of SIRT3 at the double strand-break site in response to DNA damage. Additionally, the relocalization of SIRT3 to the nucleus on MMS treatment led to concurrent decrease in H3K56ac, which is an important step in NHEJ. Depletion of SIRT3 by si-RNA mediated knock down affected recruitment of 53BP1, resulting in compromised NHEJ efficiency, and survival defect as seen by colony formation assay. Altogether, our results demonstrated that SIRT3 recruits 53BP1 to the site of damage thereby plays a significant role in NHEJ pathway.",

     "abstract": "Fanconi Anaemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by defects in DNA repair, associated with chromosomal instability and cellular hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C (MMC). The FA repair pathway involves complex DNA repair mechanisms crucial for genomic stability. Deficiencies in DNA repair genes give rise to chromosomal radiosensitivity. FA patients have shown increased clinical radiosensitivity by exhibiting adverse normal tissue side-effects. The study aimed to investigate chromosomal radiosensitivity of homozygous and heterozygous carriers of FA mutations using three micronucleus (MN) assays. The G0 and S/G2\u00a0MN assays are cytogenetic assays to evaluate DNA damage induced by ionising radiation in different phases of the cell cycle. The MMC MN assay detects DNA damage induced by a crosslinking agent in the G0 phase. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of FA and their parents were screened for the complete coding region of 20 FA genes. Blood samples of all FA patients and parents were exposed to ionising radiation of 2 and 4\u00a0Gy. Chromosomal radiosensitivity was evaluated in the G0 and S/G2 phase. Most of our patients were homozygous for the founder mutation FANCG c.637_643delTACCGCC; p.(Tyr213Lysfs*6) while one patient was compound heterozygous for FANCG c.637_643delTACCGCC and FANCG c.1379G > A, p.(Gly460Asp), a novel missense mutation. Another patient was compound heterozygous for two deleterious FANCA mutations. In FA patients, the G0- and S/G2-MN assays show significantly increased chromosomal radiosensitivity and genomic instability. Moreover, chromosomal damage was significantly elevated in MMC treated FA cells. We also observed an increase in chromosomal radiosensitivity and genomic instability in the parents using 3 assays. The effect was significant using the MMC MN assay. The MMC MN assay is advantageous as it is less labour intense, time effective and has potential as a reliable alternative method for detecting FA patients from parents and controls.",

Inhibitors of PARPs have become an exciting and real prospect for monotherapy and as sensitizers to ionising radiation (IR). The action of PARPs are reversed by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). Until recently studies of PARG have been limited by the lack of an inhibitor. Here, a first in class, specific, and cell permeable PARG inhibitor, PDD00017273, is shown to radiosensitize. Further, PDD00017273 is compared with the PARP1/2/3 inhibitor olaparib. Both olaparib and PDD00017273 altered the repair of IR-induced DNA damage, resulting in delayed resolution of RAD51 foci compared with control cells. However, only PARG inhibition induced a rapid increase in IR-induced activation of PRKDC (DNA-PK) and perturbed mitotic progression. This suggests that PARG has additional functions in the cell compared with inhibition of PARP1/2/3, likely via reversal of tankyrase activity and/or that inhibiting the removal of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) has a different consequence to inhibiting PAR addition. Overall, our data are consistent with previous genetic findings, reveal new insights into the function of PAR metabolism following IR and demonstrate for the first time the therapeutic potential of PARG inhibitors as radiosensitizing agents.",

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic chromosome ends, or telomeres, are essential for genome stability and are protected by an intricate nucleoprotein assembly. Cdc13, the major single-strand telomere-binding protein in budding yeasts, mediates critical functions in both telomere protection and telomere elongation by telomerase. In particular, the interaction between S. cerevisiae Cdc13 and telomerase subunit Est1 has long served as a paradigm for telomerase regulation. However, despite extensive investigations, the role of this interaction in regulating telomerase recruitment or activation remains controversial. In addition, budding yeast telomere repeat sequences are extraordinarily variable and how Cdc13 orthologs recognize diverse repeats is not well understood. In this report, we examined these issues using an alternative model, K. lactis. We reconstituted a direct physical interaction between purified K. lactis Cdc13 and Est1, and by analyzing point mutations, we demonstrated a close correspondence between telomere maintenance defects in vivo and Cdc13-Est1 binding defects in vitro, thus supporting a purely recruitment function for this interaction in K. lactis. Because mutations in well aligned residues of Cdc13 and Est1 in S. cerevisiae and K. lactis do not cause identical defects, our results also point to significant evolutionary divergence in the Cdc13-Est1 interface. In addition, we found that K. lactic Cdc13, unlike previously characterized orthologs, recognizes an unusually long and non-G-rich target sequence, underscoring the flexibility of the Cdc13 DNA-binding domain. Analysis of K. lactis Cdc13 and Est1 thus broadens understanding of telomere and telomerase regulation in budding yeast.",

To better understand how BER affects phenotypes associated with oxidative stress, we characterised the C. elegans nth-1 mutant, which lack the only DNA glycosylase dedicated to repair of oxidative DNA base damage, the NTH-1 DNA glycosylase.We show that nth-1 mutants have mitochondrial dysfunction characterised by lower mitochondrial DNA copy number, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species. Consistently, nth-1 mutants express markers of chronic oxidative stress with high basal phosphorylation of MAP-kinases (MAPK) but further activation of MAPK in response to the superoxide generator paraquat is attenuated. Surprisingly, nth-1 mutants also failed to induce apoptosis in response to paraquat. The ability to induce apoptosis in response to paraquat was regained when basal MAPK activation was restored to wild type levels. In conclusion, the failure of nth-1 mutants to induce apoptosis in response to paraquat is not a direct effect of the DNA repair deficiency but an indirect consequence of the compensatory cellular stress response that includes MAPK activation.",

Wild type (WT) and ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice were either fed ad libitum or subjected to fasting for 24\u00a0h, and the corresponding effects on liver gene expression, DNA damage, as well as serum values were analyzed. Ogg1 deficient mice fed ad libitum exhibited hyperglycemia, elevated insulin levels and higher liver glycogen content as well as increased accumulation of 8oxoG in mtDNA compared to age- and gender matched WT mice. Interestingly, these phenotypes were absent in ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice during fasting. Gene expression and functional analyses suggest that the diabetogenic phenotype in the ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice is due to a failure to suppress gluconeogensis in the fed state. The ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited reduced mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) capacity and a combined low activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), alluding to inefficient channeling of glycolytic products into the citric acid cycle.

Herein, we designed a non-labeled and non-radio-isotopic simple method to measure proofreading. An oligonucleotide primer is annealed to a template DNA forming a mismatched site and is proofread by Klenow fragment of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I (pol I) in the presence of all four dideoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. The proofreading excision products and re-synthesis products of single nucleotide extension are subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS). The proofreading at the mismatched site is identified by the mass change of the primer. We examined proofreading of Klenow fragment with DNAs containing various base mismatches. Single mismatches at the primer terminus can be proofread efficiently. Internal single mismatches can also be proofread at different efficiencies, with the best correction for mismatches located 2\u20134-nucleotides from the primer terminus. For mismatches located 5-nucleotides from the primer terminus there was partial correction and extension. No significant proofreading was observed for mismatches located 6\u20139-nucleotides from the primer terminus.

The results showed that T-I was a better substrate than G-I and A-I, however C-I was refractory to repair. The high resolution of MS results clearly demonstrated that all the penultimate T-I, G-I and A-I substrates had been excised last 2 dI-containing nucleotides by pol I before adding a correct ddNMP, however, pol I proofreading exonuclease tolerated the penultimate C-I mismatch allowing the primer to be extended by polymerase activity.",

Majority of point mutations are generated during error-prone bypass of modified nucleotides (translesion DNA synthesis, TLS); however, when TLS fails, replication forks stalled at lesions eventually result in more lethal effects, formation of double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Here we compared sensitivities to various compounds among mouse embryonic fibroblasts derived from wild-type and knock-out mice lacking one of the three Y-family TLS DNA polymerases (Pol\u03b7, Pol\u03b9, and Pol\u03ba) or all of them (TKO). The compounds tested in this study include genotoxins such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and nongenotoxins such as ammonium chloride. We found that TKO cells exhibited the highest sensitivities to most of the tested genotoxins, but not to the non-genotoxins. In order to quantitatively evaluate the hypersensitivity of TKO cells to different chemicals, we calculated ratios of half-maximal inhibitory concentration for WT and TKO cells. The ratios for 9 out of 10 genotoxins ranged from 2.29 to 5.73, while those for 5 nongenotoxins ranged from 0.81 to 1.63. Additionally, the two markers for DNA damage, ubiquitylated proliferating cell nuclear antigen and \u03b3-H2AX after MMS treatment, were accumulated in TKO cells more greatly than in WT cells. Furthermore, following MMS treatment, TKO cells exhibited increased frequency of sister chromatid exchange compared with WT cells. These results indicated that the hypersensitivity of TKO cells to genotoxins resulted from replication fork stalling and subsequent DNA double-strand breaks, thus demonstrating that TKO cells should be useful for evaluating chemical genotoxicity.",

This paper studies the properties of several structurally diverse synthetic (model) DNAs containing bulky modifications. Model DNAs have been designed using modified nucleosides (exo-N-{2-N-[N-(4-azido-2,5-difluoro-3-chloropyridin-6-yl)-3-aminopropionyl]aminoethyl}-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (Fap-dC) and 5-{1-[6-(5[6]-fluoresceinylcarbomoyl)hexanoyl]-3-aminoallyl}-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (Flu-dU)) and the nonnucleosidic reagent N-[6-(9-antracenylcarbomoyl)hexanoyl]-3-amino-1,2-propandiol (nAnt). The impact of these lesions on spatial organization and stability of the model DNA was evaluated. Their affinity for the damage sensor XPC was also studied.

The construct also contained a closely linked truncated \u201cdonor\u201d tk sequence. The donor could potentially restore function to the recipient gene via recombination provoked by induction of a DSB at the I-SceI site in the recipient. Repair events were recoverable by selection for tk-positive clones. The donor contained 33 mismatches relative to the recipient. The mismatches were clustered, forming a localized segment of DNA sequence displaying about 20% divergence relative to the recipient, and the mismatched segment was surrounded by regions of high homology. When the donor was aligned with the recipient, the DSB site in the recipient aligned opposite the mismatched segment, allowing us to potentially capture recombinational repair events initiating between diverged sequences. Previous work demonstrated that mammalian cells effectively avoid recombination between 20% diverged sequences. In the current study we asked whether flanking regions of high homology would enable genetic exchange between highly diverged sequences or, instead, would rejection of exchange between diverged sequences remain unchanged. We found that by surrounding mismatches with high homology, suppression of recombination between diverged sequences was overcome. Strikingly, we recovered a high frequency of gene conversion tracts positioned entirely within the mismatched sequences. We infer that such events were enabled by homologous pairing interactions between sequences surrounding the site of strand invasion. Our results suggest a search for high homology prior to recombination that is not mediated by an invading DNA terminus.",

In addition, the aromatic rings in LigI-selective inhibitors had either arylhydrazone or acylhydrazone, but not vinyl linkers. Among the LigI-selective inhibitors, L82-G17 exhibited increased activity against and selectivity for LigI compared with L82. Notably. L82-G17 is an uncompetitive inhibitor of the third step of the ligation reaction, phosphodiester bond formation. Cells expressing LigI were more sensitive to L82-G17 than isogenic LIG1 null cells. Furthermore, cells lacking nuclear LigIII\u03b1, which can substitute for LigI in DNA replication, were also more sensitive to L82-G17 than isogenic parental cells. Together, our results demonstrate that L82-G17 is a LigI-selective inhibitor with utility as a probe of the catalytic activity and cellular functions of LigI and provide a framework for the future design of DNA ligase inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) can remove a wide variety of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 terminal DNA adducts. Genetic studies in yeast identified TDP1 as a regulator of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) fidelity in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) lacking terminal adducts. In this communication, we show that TDP1 plays an important role in joining cohesive DSBs in human cells. To investigate the role of TDP1 in NHEJ in live human cells we used CRISPR/cas9 to produce TDP1-knockout (TDP1-KO) HEK-293 cells. As expected, human TDP1-KO cells were highly sensitive to topoisomerase poisons and ionizing radiation. Using a chromosomally-integrated NHEJ reporter substrate to compare end joining between wild type and TDP1-KO cells, we found that TDP1-KO cells have a 5-fold reduced ability to repair I-SceI-generated DSBs. Extracts prepared from TDP1-KO cells had reduced NHEJ activity in vitro, as compared to extracts from wild type cells. Analysis of end-joining junctions showed that TDP1 deficiency reduced end-joining fidelity, with a significant increase in insertion events, similar to previous observations in yeast. It has been reported that phosphorylation of TDP1 serine 81 (TDP1-S81) by ATM and DNA-PK stabilizes TDP1 and recruits TDP1 to sites of DNA damage. We found that end joining in TDP1-KO cells was partially restored by the non-phosphorylatable mutant TDP1-S81A, but not by the phosphomimetic TDP1-S81E. We previously reported that TDP1 physically interacted with XLF. In this study, we found that XLF binding by TDP1 was reduced 2-fold by the S81A mutation, and 10-fold by the S81E phosphomimetic mutation. Our results demonstrate a novel role for TDP1 in NHEJ in human cells. We hypothesize that TDP1 participation in human NHEJ is mediated by interaction with XLF, and that TDP1-XLF interactions and subsequent NHEJ events are regulated by phosphorylation of TDP1-S81.",

End cleaning in mammalian cells by Tdp1 and PNKP produces the conventional 3\u2032-OH and 5\u2032-phosphate DNA ends suitable for completion of repair. This repair function of PNKP is facilitated by its binding to the scaffold protein XRCC1, and phosphorylation of XRCC1 by CK2 at several consensus sites enables PNKP binding and recruitment to DNA damage. To evaluate this documented repair process, a phosphorylation mutant of XRCC1, designed to eliminate PNKP binding, was stably expressed in Xrcc1\u2212/\u2212 mouse fibroblast cells. Analysis of PNKP-GFP accumulation at micro-irradiation induced damage confirmed that the XRCC1 phosphorylation mutant failed to support efficient PNKP recruitment, whereas there was rapid recruitment in cells expressing wild-type XRCC1. Recruitment of additional fluorescently-tagged repair factors PARP-1-YFP, GFF-XRCC1, PNKP-GFP and Tdp1-GFP to micro-irradiation induced damage was assessed in wild-type XRCC1-expressing cells. PARP-1-YFP recruitment was best fit to two exponentials, whereas kinetics for the other proteins were fit to a single exponential. The similar half-times of recruitment suggest that XRCC1 may be recruited with other proteins possibly as a pre-formed complex. Xrcc1\u2212/\u2212 cells are hypersensitive to the DNA-protein cross-link inducing agent camptothecin (CPT) and the DNA oxidative agent H2O2 due in part to compromised PNKP-mediated repair. However, cells expressing the PNKP interaction mutant of XRCC1 demonstrated marked reversal of CPT hypersensitivity. This reversal represents XRCC1-dependent repair in the absence of the phosphorylation-dependent PNKP recruitment and suggests either an XRCC1-independent mechanism of PNKP recruitment or a functional back-up pathway for cleaning of blocked DNA ends.",

The recombination activities of RAD51 are activated upon its assembly into presynaptic filaments on single-stranded DNA at resected DSB ends. Defects in filament assembly caused by mutations in RAD51 or its regulators such as BRCA2 are associated with human cancer. Here we describe two novel RAD51 missense variants located in the multimerization/BRCA2 binding region of RAD51. F86L is a breast tumor-derived somatic variant that affects the interface between adjacent RAD51 protomers in the presynaptic filament. E258A is a germline variant that maps to the interface region between the N-terminal and RecA homology domains of RAD51. Both variants exhibit abnormal biochemistry including altered DNA strand exchange activity. Both variants inhibit the DNA strand exchange activity of wild-type RAD51, suggesting a mechanism for negative dominance. The inhibitory effect of F86L on wild-type RAD51 is surprising since F86L alone exhibits robust DNA strand exchange activity. Our findings indicate that even DNA strand exchange-proficient variants can have negative functional interactions with wild-type RAD51. Thus heterozygous F86L or E258 mutations in RAD51 could promote genomic instability, and thereby contribute to tumor progression.",

Pol \u03b2 was localized to mammalian mitochondria by electron microscopic-immunogold staining, immunofluorescence co-localization and biochemical experiments. Extracts from purified mitochondria exhibited base excision repair activity that was dependent on pol \u03b2. Mitochondria from pol \u03b2-deficient mouse fibroblasts had compromised DNA repair and showed elevated levels of superoxide radicals after hydrogen peroxide treatment. Mitochondria in pol \u03b2-deficient fibroblasts displayed altered morphology by electron microscopy.

Numerous studies have shown the efficacy and safety of natural products, and they have been widely used as alternative treatments for a wide range of illnesses, including cancers. However, it remains unknown whether natural products affect homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA repair and whether these compounds can be used as sensitizers with minimal toxicity to improve patients\u2019 responses to radiation therapy, a mainstay of treatment for many human cancers. In this study, in order to systematically identify natural products with an inhibitory effect on HR repair, we developed a high-throughput image-based HR repair screening assay and screened a chemical library containing natural products. Among the most interesting of the candidate compounds identified from the screen was \u03b2-thujaplicin, a bioactive compound isolated from the heart wood of plants in the Cupressaceae family, can significantly inhibit HR repair. We further demonstrated that \u03b2-thujaplicin inhibits HR repair by reducing the recruitment of a key HR repair protein, Rad51, to DNA double-strand breaks. More importantly, our results showed that \u03b2-thujaplicin can radiosensitize cancer cells. Additionally, \u03b2-thujaplicin sensitizes cancer cells to PARP inhibitor in different cancer cell lines. Collectively, our findings for the first time identify natural compound \u03b2-thujaplicin, which has a good biosafety profile, as a novel HR repair inhibitor with great potential to be translated into clinical applications as a sensitizer to DNA-damage-inducing treatment such as radiation and PARP inhibitor. In addition, our study provides proof of the principle that our robust high-throughput functional HR repair assay can be used for a large-scale screening system to identify novel natural products that regulate DNA repair and cellular responses to DNA damage-inducing treatments such as radiation therapy.",

     "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Most cancers present high degrees of genomic instability. DNA damage and replication checkpoints function as barriers to halt cell cycle progression until damage is resolved, preventing the perpetuation of errors. Activation of these checkpoints is critically dependent on Claspin, an adaptor protein that mediates the phosphorylation of the effector kinase Chk1 by ATR. However, Claspin also performs other roles related to the protection and maintenance of cell and genome integrity. For instance, following DNA damage and checkpoint activation, Claspin bridges checkpoint responses to DNA repair or to apoptosis. During DNA replication, Claspin acts a sensor and couples DNA unwinding to strand polymerization, and may also indirectly regulate replication initiation at firing origins. As Claspin participates in several processes that are vital to maintenance of cell homeostasis, its function is tightly regulated at multiple levels. Nevertheless, little is known about its role in cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that Claspin inactivation could be an essential event during carcinogenesis, indicating that Claspin may function as a tumour suppressor. In this review, we will examine the functions of Claspin and how its deregulation may contribute to cancer initiation and progression. To conclude, we will discuss means by which Claspin can be targeted for cancer therapy.",

If uncorrected, A:8-oxo-G mispairs can give rise to C:G\u00a0\u2192\u00a0A:T transversion mutations. Cells have evolved a variety of pathways to mitigate the mutational potential of 8-oxo-G that include i) mechanisms to avoid incorporation of oxidized nucleotides into DNA through nucleotide pool sanitisation enzymes (by MTH1, MTH2, MTH3 and NUDT5), ii) base excision repair (BER) of 8-oxo-G in DNA (involving MUTYH, OGG1, Pol \u03bb, and other components of the BER machinery), and iii) faithful bypass of 8-oxo-G lesions during replication (using a switch between replicative Pols and Pol \u03bb). In the following, the fate of 8-oxo-G in mammalian cells is reviewed in detail. The differential origins of 8-oxo-G in DNA and its consequences for genetic stability will be covered. This will be followed by a thorough discussion of the different mechanisms in place to cope with 8-oxo-G with an emphasis on Pol \u03bb-mediated correct bypass of 8-oxo-G during MUTYH-initiated BER as well as replication across 8-oxo-G. Furthermore, the multitude of mechanisms in place to regulate key proteins involved in 8-oxo-G repair will be reviewed. Novel functions of 8-oxo-G as an epigenetic-like regulator and insights into the repair of 8-oxo-G within the cellular context will be touched upon.

The first step in BER is the recognition and removal of the nucleobase lesion by a glycosylase enzyme. For example, human oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) is responsible for removal of the prototypic oxidatively damaged nucleobase, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG). To date, most studies of glycosylases have used free duplex DNA substrates. However, cellular DNA is packaged as repeating nucleosome units, with 145 base pair segments of DNA wrapped around histone protein octamers. Previous studies revealed inhibition of hOGG1 at the nucleosome dyad axis and in the absence of chromatin remodelers. In this study, we reveal that even in the absence of chromatin remodelers or external cofactors, hOGG1 can initiate BER at positions off the dyad axis and that this activity is facilitated by spontaneous and transient unwrapping of DNA from the histones. Additionally, we find that solution accessibility as determined by hydroxyl radical footprinting is not fully predictive of glycosylase activity and that histone tails can suppress hOGG1 activity. We therefore suggest that local nuances in the nucleosome environment and histone-DNA interactions can impact glycosylase activity.",

During undisturbed ripening, nicks and breaks should be repaired by pathways that do not invoke long-range end resection or genetic exchange by homologous recombination, after which DNA replication might be initiated. We found that DNA damage reduced the viability of spores that lacked DisA, BMT (RadA/Sms, RuvAB or RecG), the Holliday junction resolvase RecU, or the translesion synthesis DNA polymerases (PolY1 or PolY2). DisA and RadA/Sms, in concert with RuvAB, RecG, RecU, PolY1 or PolY2, are needed to bypass replication-blocking lesions. DisA, which binds to stalled or reversed forks, did not apparently affect initiation of PriA-dependent DNA replication in vitro.

CPT stabilizes the covalent Top1-DNA cleavage intermediate, which leads to toxic double-strand breaks (DSBs) when encountered by a replication fork. In the current study, we examined genetic instability associated with CPT treatment or with Top1 overexpression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Two types of instability were monitored: Top1-dependent deletions in haploid strains, which do not require processing into a DSB, and instability at the repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus in diploid strains, which reflects DSB formation. Three 2-bp deletion hotspots were examined and mutations at each were elevated either when a wild-type strain was treated with CPT or when TOP1 was overexpressed, with the mutation frequency correlating with the level of TOP1 overexpression. Under both conditions, deletions at novel positions were enriched. rDNA stability was examined by measuring loss-of-heterozygosity and as was observed previously upon CPT treatment of a wild-type strain, Top1 overexpression destabilized rDNA. We conclude that too much, as well as too little of Top1 is detrimental to eukaryotic genomes, and that CPT has destabilizing effects that extend beyond those associated with DSB formation.",

Despite its central role in NHEJ, the effects of XLF deficiency are surprisingly variable in different biological contexts, and different individual cell lines. This review summarizes the role of XLF in NHEJ, and the unexpected complexity of its interplay with other repair factors in supporting radiosurvival and V(D)J recombination.",

In this study, we systematically characterized VPA-induced HU sensitization of breast cancer cells. Multiple breast cancer cell models were employed to investigate whether the safe concentration of 0.5\u00a0mM VPA and 2\u00a0mM HU can result in DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and impact cell survival. Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was explored through cell biology assays, including clonogenic survival, homologous recombination (HR) activity, immunoblot and immunofluorescence. We found that VPA and HU cooperatively suppressed cancer cell survival. VPA resulted in the accumulation of more DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in response to HU-induced replication arrest and was able to block HU-stimulated homologous recombination (HR) through inhibiting the activity of two key HR repair proteins by hyperphosphorylation of replication protein A2 (RPA2-p) and recombinase Rad51. However, apoptosis was not detected under this condition. In addition, the results from the survival fraction in the cells expressing defective RPA2-p showed that VPA disrupted the HU-induced RPA2-p-Rad51-mediated HR pathway. Importantly, these findings were further supported by analyzing primary-culture cells from the tissue of chemical carcinogen (DMBA)-induced breast cancer in rats. Thus, our data demonstrated that VPA and HU synergistically suppressed tumor cells via disturbing RPA2-p-mediated DNA repair pathway, which provides a new way for combining chemotherapeutic drugs to sensitize breast cancer cells.",

In addition, there is accumulating evidence that OGG1 and its substrate 8-oxoG might function in the regulation of certain genes, which could account for an attenuated immune response observed in Ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice in several settings. Indications for at least two different mechanisms have been obtained. Thus, OGG1 could either act as an ancillary transcription factor cooperating with the lysine-specific demethylase LSD1 or as an activator of small GTPases. Here, we analysed the activation by lipopolysaccaride (LPS) of primary splenocytes obtained from two different Ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mouse strains. We found that the induction of TNF-\u03b1 expression was reduced in splenocytes (in particular macrophages) of both Ogg1\u2212/\u2212 strains. Notably, an inhibitor of LSD1, OG-L002, reduced the induction of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in splenocytes from wild-type mice to the level observed in splenocytes from Ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice and had no influence in the latter cells. In contrast, inhibitors of the MAP kinases p38 and JNK as well as the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine attenuated the LPS-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 expression both in the absence and presence of OGG1. The free base 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine had no influence on the TNF-\u03b1 expression in the splenocytes. The data demonstrate that OGG1 plays a role in an LSD1-dependent pathway of LPS-induced macrophage activation in mice.",

     "abstract": "Although chromosome aberrations are known to derive from distance-dependent mis-rejoining of chromosome fragments, evaluating whether a certain model describes such \u201cproximity effects\u201d better than another one is complicated by the fact that different approaches have often been tested under different conditions. Herein, a biophysical model (\u201cBIANCA\u201d, i.e. BIophysical ANalysis of Cell death and chromosome Aberrations) was upgraded, implementing explicit chromosome-arm domains and two new models for the dependence of the rejoining probability on the fragment initial distance, r. Such probability was described either by an exponential function like exp(\u2212r/r0), or by a Gaussian function like exp(\u2212r2/2\u03c32), where r0 and \u03c3 were adjustable parameters. The second, and last, parameters was the yield of \u201cCluster Lesions\u201d (CL), where \u201cCluster Lesion\u201d defines a critical DNA damage producing two independent chromosome fragments. The model was applied to low-LET-irradiated lymphocytes (doses: 1\u20134\u00a0Gy) and fibroblasts (1\u20136.1\u00a0Gy). Good agreement with experimental yields of dicentrics and centric rings, and thus their ratio (\u201cF-ratio\u201d), was found by both the exponential model (with r0\u00a0=\u00a00.8\u00a0\u03bcm for lymphocytes and 0.7\u00a0\u03bcm for fibroblasts) and the Gaussian model (with \u03c3\u00a0=\u00a01.1\u00a0\u03bcm for lymphocytes and 1.3\u00a0\u03bcm for fibroblasts). While the former also allowed reproducing dose-responses for excess acentric fragments, the latter substantially underestimated the experimental curves. Both models provided G-ratios (ratio of acentric to centric rings) higher than those expected from randomness, although the values calculated by the Gaussian model were lower than those calculated by the exponential one. For lymphocytes the calculated G-ratios were in good agreement with the experimental ones, whereas for fibroblasts both models substantially underestimated the experimental results, which deserves further investigation. This work suggested that, although both models performed better than a step model (which previously allowed reproducing the F-ratio but underestimated the G-ratio), an exponential function describes proximity effects better than a Gaussian one.",

We show that localization of APEH at sites of nuclear damage is mediated by direct interaction with XRCC1, a scaffold protein that accelerates the repair of DNA single-strand breaks. We show that APEH interacts with the amino-terminal domain of XRCC1, and that APEH facilitates both single-strand break repair and cell survival following exposure to H2O2 in human cells.

     "abstract": "The cDNA encoding human DNA polymerase \u03b9 (POLI) was cloned in 1999. At that time, it was believed that the POLI gene encoded a protein of 715 amino acids. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies led to the realization that there is an upstream, in-frame initiation codon that would encode a DNA polymerase \u03b9 (pol\u03b9) protein of 740 amino acids. The extra 25 amino acid region is rich in acidic residues (11/25) and is reasonably conserved in eukaryotes ranging from fish to humans. As a consequence, the curated Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database identified pol\u03b9 as a 740 amino acid protein. However, the existence of the 740 amino acid pol\u03b9 has never been shown experimentally. Using highly specific antibodies to the 25 N-terminal amino acids of pol\u03b9, we were unable to detect the longer 740 amino acid (\u03b9-long) isoform in western blots. However, trace amounts of the \u03b9-long isoform were detected after enrichment by immunoprecipitation. One might argue that the longer isoform may have a distinct biological function, if it exhibits significant differences in its enzymatic properties from the shorter, well-characterized 715 amino acid pol\u03b9. We therefore purified and characterized recombinant full-length (740 amino acid) pol\u03b9-long and compared it to full-length (715 amino acid) pol\u03b9-short in vitro. The metal ion requirements for optimal catalytic activity differ slightly between \u03b9-long and \u03b9-short, but under optimal conditions, both isoforms exhibit indistinguishable enzymatic properties in vitro. We also report that like \u03b9-short, the \u03b9-long isoform can be monoubiquitinated and polyubiuquitinated in vivo, as well as form damage induced foci in vivo. We conclude that the predominant isoform of DNA pol\u03b9 in human cells is the shorter 715 amino acid protein and that if, or when, expressed, the longer 740 amino acid isoform has identical properties to the considerably more abundant shorter isoform.",

Despite their instability, CFS are ubiquitous throughout the human genome and associated with large tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. CFSs are enriched with repetitive DNA sequences, one feature postulated to explain why these loci are inherently difficult to replicate, and sensitive to replication stress. We have shown that specialized DNA polymerases (Pols) \u03b7 and \u03ba replicate CFS-derived sequences more efficiently than the replicative Pol \u03b4. However, we lacked an understanding of how these enzymes cooperate to ensure efficient CFS replication. Here, we designed a model of lagging strand replication with RFC loaded PCNA that allows for maximal activity of the four-subunit human Pol \u03b4 holoenzyme, Pol \u03b7, and Pol \u03ba in polymerase mixing assays. We discovered that Pol \u03b7 and \u03ba are both able to exchange with Pol \u03b4 stalled at repetitive CFS sequences, enhancing Normalized Replication Efficiency. We used this model to test the impact of PCNA mono-ubiquitination on polymerase exchange, and found no change in polymerase cooperativity in CFS replication compared with unmodified PCNA. Finally, we modeled replication stress in vitro using aphidicolin and found that Pol \u03b4 holoenzyme synthesis was significantly inhibited in a dose-dependent manner, preventing any replication past the CFS. Importantly, Pol \u03b7 and \u03ba were still proficient in rescuing this stalled Pol \u03b4 synthesis, which may explain, in part, the CFS instability phenotype of aphidicolin-treated Pol \u03b7 and Pol \u03ba-deficient cells. In total, our data support a model wherein Pol \u03b4 stalling at CFSs allows for free exchange with a specialized polymerase that is not driven by PCNA.",

Here we address the role of the Ku80 C-terminal region (CTR) in the DNA-dependent interaction of Ku70/80 with DNA-PKcs using purified components and defined DNA structures.

Moreover, the DNA-PKcs-Ku complex preferentially forms on 25 bp DNA with a poly-pyrimidine ssDNA extension.Our work clarifies the role of the Ku80 CTR and dsDNA ends on the interaction of DNA-PKcs with Ku and provides key information to guide assembly and biology of NHEJ complexes.",

To study DNA replication encountering O6-MeG by the DNA polymerase (gp90) of P. aeruginosa phage PaP1, we analyzed steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation opposite O6-MeG by gp90 exo\u2212. O6-MeG partially inhibited full-length extension by gp90 exo\u2212. O6-MeG greatly reduces dNTP incorporation efficiency, resulting in 67-fold preferential error-prone incorporation of dTTP than dCTP. Gp90 exo\u2212 extends beyond T:O6-MeG 2-fold more efficiently than C:O6-MeG. Incorporation of dCTP opposite G and incorporation of dCTP or dTTP opposite O6-MeG show fast burst phases.

The presence of O6-MeG at template does not affect the binding affinity of polymerase to DNA but it weakened their binding in the presence of dCTP and Mg2+. Misincorporation of dTTP opposite O6-MeG further weakens the binding affinity of polymerase to DNA. The priority of dTTP incorporation opposite O6-MeG is originated from the fact that dTTP can induce a faster conformational change step and a faster chemical step than dCTP.

The consumption of Ginger extract along with ethanol ameliorated the changes in MHC isoforms gene expression and reduced the elevated amount of 8-OHdG and NADPH oxidase.

Namely, a synergistic action of ExoI, ExoVII, SbcCD and ExoX single-strand specific exonucleases (ssExos) of 3\u2032-5\u2032 polarity was essential for preserving cell viability, DNA repair and homologous recombination in the recB1080/recB1067 mutants, to the same extent as the redundant action of 5\u2032-tail trimming ssExos RecJ and ExoVII. recB1080 derivatives lacking 3\u2032-5\u2032 ssExos also showed a strong induction of the SOS response and greatly increased SOS-dependent mutagenesis. Furthermore, we show that ExoI and ExoVII ssExos act synergistically in suppressing illegitimate recombination in the recB1080 mutant but not in a wt strain, while working in concert with the RecQ helicase. Remarkably, 3\u2032-5\u2032 ssExos show synergism with RecQ helicase in the recB1080 mutant in all the assays tested. The effect of inactivation of 3\u2032-5\u2032 ssExos in the recB1080/recB1067 mutants was much stronger than in wt, recD, and recB strains. These results demonstrate that the presence of a long, reactive 3\u2032 overhang can be as toxic for a cell as its complete absence, i.e. it may prevent DSB repair.

Remarkably, XPA and other NER proteins have been detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation at some active promoters, and NER deficiency is reported to influence the activated transcription of selected genes. However, the global influence of XPA on transcription in human cells has not been determined. We analyzed the human transcriptome by RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We first confirmed that XPA is confined to the cell nucleus even in the absence of external DNA damage, in contrast to previous reports that XPA is normally resident in the cytoplasm and is imported following DNA damage. We then analyzed four genetically matched human cell line pairs deficient or proficient in XPA. Of the \u223c14,000 genes transcribed in each cell line, 325 genes (2%) had a significant XPA-dependent directional change in gene expression that was common to all four pairs (with a false discovery rate of 0.05). These genes were enriched in pathways for the maintenance of mitochondria. Only 27 common genes were different by more than 1.5-fold. The most significant hits were AKR1C1 and AKR1C2, involved in steroid hormone metabolism. AKR1C2 protein was lower in all of the immortalized XPA-deficient cells. Retinoic acid treatment led to modest XPA-dependent activation of some genes with transcription-related functions. We conclude that XPA status does not globally influence human gene transcription.

The DNA glycosylase NTHL1 in these extracts was able to excise Tg from both naked DNA and sites in nucleosomes that earlier studies had shown to be sterically accessible. However, the same extracts were able to excise lesions from sterically-occluded sites in nucleosomes only after the addition of Mg2+/ATP. Gel mobility shift assays indicated that nucleosomes remain largely intact following the Mg2+/ATP \u2212dependent excision reaction. Size exclusion chromatography indicated that the NTHL1-stimulating activity has a relatively low molecular weight, close to that of NTHL1 and other BER glycosylases; column fractions that contained the very large chromatin remodeling complexes did not exhibit this same stimulatory activity. These results indicate that cells possess a factor(s) that promotes the initiation of BER in chromatin, but differs from most known chromatin remodeling complexes.",

Exonuclease I (EXO1) interacts with the MMR machinery and has been proposed to act downstream of the mismatch recognition proteins in mismatch correction. EXO1 has also been shown to participate in extensive DSB end resection, an initial step in the HR pathway. To assess the contribution of EXO1 to HR in mammalian cells, DSB-inducible reporters were introduced into Exo1\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic stem cells, including a novel GFP reporter containing several silent polymorphisms to monitor HR between diverged sequences. Compared to HR between identical sequences which was not clearly affected, HR between diverged sequences was substantially increased in Exo1\u2212/\u2212 cells although to a lesser extent than seen in Msh2\u2212/\u2212 cells. Thus, like canonical MMR proteins, EXO1 can restrain aberrant HR events between diverged sequence elements in the genome.",

The enzymatic properties of the newly found putative DNA glycosylase are unknown. To test the potential UDG activity and evaluate phylogenetic classification, we isolated one SMUG1-like glycosylase representative from Listeria innocua (Lin). A biochemical screening of DNA glycosylase activity in vitro indicates that Lin SMUG1-like glycosylase is a single-strand selective uracil DNA glycosylase. The UDG activity on DNA bubble structures provides clue to its physiological significance in vivo. Mutagenesis and molecular modeling analyses reveal that Lin SMUG1-like glycosylase has similar functional motifs with SMUG1 enzymes; however, it contains a distinct catalytic doublet S67-S68 in motif 1 that is not found in any families in the UDG superfamily. Experimental investigation shows that the S67M-S68N double mutant is catalytically more active than either S67M or S68N single mutant. Coupled with mutual information analysis, the results indicate a high degree of correlation in the evolution of SMUG1-like enzymes. This study underscores the functional and catalytic diversity in the evolution of enzymes in UDG superfamily.",

It acts primarily as a trap for DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) protein by forming covalent complexes between DNMT protein and zebularine-substrate DNA. It\u2019s well documented that replication-blocking DNA lesions can cause replication fork collapse and thereby to the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). DSB are dangerous lesions that can lead to potentially oncogenic genomic rearrangements or cell death. The two major pathways for repair of DSB are non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). Recently, multiple functions for the HR machinery have been identified at arrested forks. Here we investigate in more detail the importance of the lesions induced by zebularine in terms of DNA damage and cytotoxicity as well as the role of HR in the repair of these lesions. When we examined the contribution of NHEJ and HR in the repair of DSB induced by zebularine we found that these breaks were preferentially repaired by HR. Also we show that the production of DSB is dependent on active replication. To test this, we determined chromosome damage by zebularine while transiently inhibiting DNA synthesis. Here we report that cells deficient in single-strand break (SSB) repair are hypersensitive to zebularine. We have observed more DSB induced by zebularine in XRCC1 deficient cells, likely to be the result of conversion of SSB into toxic DSB when encountered by a replication fork. Furthermore we demonstrate that HR is required for the repair of these breaks. Overall, our data suggest that zebularine induces replication-dependent DSB which are preferentially repaired by HR.",

In the crystal structure of archaeal Hel308 bound to a tailed DNA duplex, core helicase domains encircle single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a \u201cratchet\u201d for directional translocation. A winged helix domain (WHD) is also present, but its function is mysterious. We investigated the WHD in full-length Hel308, identifying that mutations in a solvent exposed \u03b1-helix resulted in reduced DNA binding and unwinding activities. When isolated from the rest of Hel308, the WHD protein alone bound to duplex DNA but not ssDNA, and DNA binding by WHD protein was abolished by the same mutations as were analyzed in full-length Hel308. Isolated WHD from a human Hel308 homologue (HelQ) also bound to duplex DNA. By disrupting the interface between the Hel308 WHD and a RecA-like domain, a topology typical of Ski2 helicases, we show that this is crucial for ATPase and helicase activities. The data suggest a model in which the WHD promotes activity of Hel308 directly, through binding to duplex DNA that is distinct from ssDNA binding by core helicase, and indirectly through interaction with the RecA-like domain. We propose how the WHD may contribute to ssDNA translocation, resulting in DNA helicase activity or in removal of other DNA bound proteins by \u201creeling\u201d ssDNA.",

In the absence of core C-NHEJ factors, DNA repair can be performed by Alternative End-Joining, which likely depends on DNA Ligase 1 and DNA Ligase 3. Genetic inactivation of C-NHEJ factors, such as Ku70, Ku80, XLF, PAXX and DNA-PKcs results in viable mice showing increased levels of genomic instability and sensitivity to DSBs. Knockouts of XRCC4 or Lig4, on the other hand, as well as combined inactivation of XLF and DNA-PKcs, or XLF and PAXX, result in late embryonic lethality in mice, which in most cases correlate with severe apoptosis in the central nervous system. Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of the Ku70 gene rescues the synthetic lethality between XLF and DNA-PKcs, resulting in triple knockout mice that are indistinguishable from Ku70-deficient littermates by size or levels of genomic instability. Moreover, we find that combined inactivation of Ku70 and XLF results in viable mice. Together, these findings suggest that Ku70 is epistatic with XLF and DNA-PKcs and support a model in which inactivation of Ku70 allows DNA lesions to become accessible to alternative DNA repair pathways.",

Histone-modifying enzymes play a central role in the DNA repair process through the deposition and removal of post-translational modifications on the histone tails. Specific histone modification act in the DNA repair process through the recruitment of proteins and complexes with specific enzymatic activities, or by altering the chromatin state at the site of DNA lesions. The conserved SET1/MLL family of histone methyltransferases (HMT) catalyzes methylation of histone H3 on Lysine 4 (H3K4), a histone modification universally associated with actively transcribed genes. Studies have focused on the role of SET1/MLL proteins in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Much less is known on their role in the DNA repair process in a developmental context. Here we show that SET-2, the Caenorhabditis elegans orthologue of SET1, is required to preserve germline genome integrity over subsequent generations. Animals lacking the SET-2 catalytic subunit show a transgenerational increase in sensitivity to DNA damage-inducing agents that is accompanied by a defect in double-strand break (DSB) repair and chromosome fragmentation. These defects are not due to a failure to activate the DNA damage response (DDR) that allows detection, signaling and repair of DNA lesions, because cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, key components of this pathway, are efficiently induced in set-2 mutant animal. Rather, our results suggest that SET-2 plays a role in the transgenerational maintenance of genome stability by acting in DNA repair downstream of DDR signaling.",

Ultraviolet (UV) light induces lesions that obstruct DNA access during transcription, replication, and repair. Failure to remove UV-induced lesions can abrogate gene expression and cell division, resulting in permanent DNA mutations. To defend against UV damage, cells utilize transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) to quickly target lesions within active genes. In cases of long-term genotoxic stress, a slower alternative pathway promotes degradation of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) to allow for global genomic nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER). The crosstalk between TC-NER and GG-NER pathways and the extent of their coordination with other nuclear events has remained elusive. We aimed to identify functional links between the DNA damage response (DDR) and the mRNA 3\u2032-end processing complex. Our labs have previously shown that UV-induced inhibition of mRNA processing is a conserved DDR between yeast and mammalian cells. Here we have identified mutations in the yeast mRNA 3\u2032-end processing cleavage factor IA (CFIA) and cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) that confer sensitivity to UV-type DNA damage. In the absence of TC-NER, CFIA and CPF mutants show reduced UV tolerance and an increased frequency of UV-induced genomic mutations, consistent with a role for RNA processing factors in an alternative DNA repair pathway. CFIA and CPF mutants impaired the ubiquitination and degradation of Pol II following DNA damage, but the co-transcriptional recruitment of Pol II degradation factors Elc1 and Def1 was undiminished. Overall these data are consistent with yeast 3\u2032-end processing factors contributing to the removal of Pol II stalled at UV-type DNA lesions, a functional interaction that is conserved between homologous factors in yeast and human cells.",

Here we observe a mechanism for generating MutS2 expression diversity in the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori, and identify a unique MutS2 domain responsible for specific DNA-binding. H. pylori strains differ in mutS2 expression due to variations in the DNA upstream sequence containing short sequence repeats. Based on Western blots, mutS2 in some strains appears to be co-translated with the upstream gene, but in other strains (e.g. UA948) such translational coupling does not occur. Accordingly, strain UA948 had phenotypes similar to its \u0394mutS2 derivative, whereas expression of MutS2 at a separate locus in UA948 (the genetically complemented strain) displayed a lower mutation rate and lower transformation frequency than did \u0394mutS2. A series of truncated HpMutS2 proteins were purified and tested for their specific abilities to bind 8-oxoG-containing DNA (GO:C) and Holiday Junction structures (HJ). The specific DNA binding domain was localized to an area adjacent to the Smr nuclease domain, and it encompasses 30-amino-acid-residues containing a \u201cKPPKNKFKPPK\u201d motif. Gel shift assays and competition assays supported that a truncated version of HpMutS2-C12 (\u223c12\u00a0kDa protein containing the specific DNA-binding domain) has much greater capacity to bind to HJ or GO:C DNA than to normal double stranded DNA. By studying the in vivo roles of the separate domains of HpMutS2, we observed that the truncated versions were unable to complement the \u0394mutS2 strain, suggesting the requirement for coordinated function of all the domains in vivo.",

In the present article, we report on findings demonstrating that polyP functions as a source of Pi when required to sustain the dNTP increment essential for DNA repair after damage. We show that mutant yeast cells without polyP produce less dNTPs upon DNA damage and that their survival is compromised. In contrast, when polyP levels are ectopically increased, yeast cells become more resistant to DNA damage. More importantly, we show that when polyP is reduced in HEK293 mammalian cell line cells and in human dermal primary fibroblasts (HDFa), these cells become more sensitive to DNA damage, suggesting that the protective role of polyP against DNA damage is evolutionary conserved. In conclusion, we present polyP as a molecule involved in resistance to DNA damage and suggest that polyP may be a putative target for new approaches in cancer treatment or prevention.",

     "abstract": "Misalignment of a nascent strand and the use of an alternative template during DNA replication, a process termed \u201ctemplate-switching\u201d, can give rise to frequent mutations and genetic rearrangements. Mutational hotspots are frequently found associated with imperfect inverted repeats (\u201cquasipalindromes\u201d or \u201cQPs\u201d) in many organisms, including bacteriophage, bacteria, yeast and mammals. Evidence suggests that QPs mutate by a replication template-switch whereby one copy of the inverted repeat templates synthesis of the other. To study quasipalindrome-associated mutagenesis (\u201cQPM\u201d) more systematically, we have engineered mutational reporters in the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli, that revert to Lac+ specifically by QPM. We and others have shown that QPM is more efficient during replication of the leading strand than it is on the lagging strand. We have previously shown that QPM is elevated and that the leading-strand bias is lost in mutants lacking the major 3\u2032 ssDNA exonucleases, ExoI and ExoVII. This suggests that one or both of these exonucleases more efficiently abort template-switches on the lagging strand. Here, we show that ExoI is primarily responsible for this bias and that its ability to be recruited by single-strand DNA binding protein plays a critical role in QPM avoidance and strand bias. In addition to these stand-alone exonucleases, loss of the 3\u2032 proofreading exonuclease activity of the replicative DNA polymerase III also greatly elevates QPM. This may be because template-switching is initiated by base misincorporation, leading to polymerase dissociation and subsequent nascent strand misalignment; alternatively or additionally, the proofreading exonuclease may scavenge displaced 3\u2032 DNA that would otherwise be free to misalign.",

     "abstract": "A high flux of reactive oxygen species during oxidative stress results in oxidative modification of cellular components including DNA. Oxidative DNA \u201cdamage\u201d to the heterocyclic bases is considered deleterious because polymerases may incorrectly read the modifications causing mutations. A prominent member in this class is the oxidized guanine base 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (OG) that is moderately mutagenic effecting G\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T transversion mutations. Recent reports have identified that formation of OG in G-rich regulatory elements in the promoters of the VEGF, TNF\u03b1, and SIRT1 genes can increase transcription via activation of the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Work in our laboratory with the G-rich sequence in the promoter of VEGF concluded that BER drives a shift in structure to a G-quadruplex conformation leading to gene activation in mammalian cells. More specifically, removal of OG from the duplex context by 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1) produces an abasic site (AP) that destabilizes the duplex, shifting the equilibrium toward the G-quadruplex fold because of preferential extrusion of the AP into a loop. The AP is bound but inefficiently cleaved by apurinic/apyrimidinic endoDNase I (APE1) that likely allows recruitment of activating transcription factors for gene induction. The ability of OG to induce transcription ascribes a regulatory or epigenetic-like role for this oxidatively modified base. We compare OG to the 5-methylcytosine (5mC) epigenetic pathway including its oxidized derivatives, some of which poise genes for transcription while also being substrates for BER. The mutagenic potential of OG to induce only \u223cone-third the number of mutations (G\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T) compared to deamination of 5mC producing C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T mutations is described. These comparisons blur the line between friendly epigenetic base modifications and those that are foes, i.e. DNA \u201cdamage,\u201d causing genetic mutations.",

     "abstract": "Double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most lethal DNA lesions, and a variety of pathways have evolved to manage their repair in a timely fashion. One such pathway is homologous recombination (HR), in which information from an undamaged donor site is used as a template for repair. Although many of the biochemical steps of HR are known, the physical movements of chromosomes that must underlie the pairing of homologous sequence during mitotic DSB repair have remained mysterious. Recently, several groups have begun to use a variety of genetic and cell biological tools to study this important question. These studies reveal that both damaged and undamaged loci increase the volume of the nuclear space that they explore after the formation of DSBs. This DSB-induced increase in chromosomal mobility is regulated by many of the same factors that are important during HR, such as ATR-dependent checkpoint activation and the recombinase Rad51, suggesting that this phenomenon may facilitate the search for homology. In this perspective, we review current research into the mobility of chromosomal loci during HR, as well as possible underlying mechanisms, and discuss the critical questions that remain to be answered. Although we focus primarily on recent studies in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, examples of experiments performed in higher eukaryotes are also included, which reveal that increased mobility of damaged loci is a process conserved throughout evolution.",

     "abstract": "Vertebrate CtIP, and its fission yeast (Ctp1), budding yeast (Sae2) and plant (Com1) orthologs have emerged as key regulatory molecules in cellular responses to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). By modulating the nucleolytic 5\u2032-3\u2032 resection activity of the Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1 (MRN) DSB repair processing and signaling complex, CtIP/Ctp1/Sae2/Com1 is integral to the channeling of DNA double strand breaks through DSB repair by homologous recombination (HR). Nearly two decades since its discovery, emerging new data are defining the molecular underpinnings for CtIP DSB repair regulatory activities. CtIP homologs are largely intrinsically unstructured proteins comprised of expanded regions of low complexity sequence, rather than defined folded domains typical of DNA damage metabolizing enzymes and nucleases. A compact structurally conserved N-terminus forms a functionally critical tetrameric helical dimer of dimers (THDD) region that bridges CtIP oligomers, and is flexibly appended to a conserved C-terminal Sae2-homology DNA binding and DSB repair pathway choice regulatory hub which influences nucleolytic activities of the MRN core nuclease complex. The emerging evidence from structural, biophysical, and biological studies converges on CtIP having functional roles in DSB repair that include: 1) dynamic DNA strand coordination through direct DNA binding and DNA bridging activities, 2) MRN nuclease complex cofactor functions that direct MRN endonucleolytic cleavage of protein-blocked DSB ends and 3) acting as a protein binding hub targeted by the cell cycle regulatory apparatus, which influences CtIP expression and activity via layers of post-translational modifications, protein\u2013protein interactions and DNA binding.",

Several FAN1 mutations are observed in various cancers and degenerative diseases. Recently, several crystal structures of the FAN1-DNA complexes have been reported, and to date, these represent the only structures for a DNA bound ICL-repair nuclease. Puzzlingly, human FAN1 forms two different quaternary structures with different DNA binding modes, and based on these structures, two ICL-repair mechanisms have been proposed. In one mechanism, monomeric FAN1 recognizes the 5\u2032 flap terminal phosphate via a basic pocket and successively cleaves at every third nucleotide of the DNA substrates. In the other mechanism, dimeric FAN1 scans, latches, and unwinds the postnick duplex of the substrate DNA to direct the scissile phosphodiester group to the active site. In this review, we discuss the structures, function, and proposed mechanisms of FAN1 nuclease, and provide the insights into its role in ICL repair and in processing of stalled replication forks.",

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes contain many repetitive DNA sequences that exhibit size instability. Some repeat elements have the added complication of being able to form secondary structures, such as hairpin loops, slipped DNA, triplex DNA or G-quadruplexes. Especially when repeat sequences are long, these DNA structures can form a significant impediment to DNA replication and repair, leading to DNA nicks, gaps, and breaks. In turn, repair or replication fork restart attempts within the repeat DNA can lead to addition or removal of repeat elements, which can sometimes lead to disease. One important DNA repair mechanism to maintain genomic integrity is recombination. Though early studies dismissed recombination as a mechanism driving repeat expansion and instability, recent results indicate that mitotic recombination is a key pathway operating within repetitive DNA. The action is two-fold: first, it is an important mechanism to repair nicks, gaps, breaks, or stalled forks to prevent chromosome fragility and protect cell health; second, recombination can cause repeat expansions or contractions, which can be deleterious. In this review, we summarize recent developments that illuminate the role of recombination in maintaining genome stability at DNA repeats.",

     "abstract": "Before leaving the house, it is a good idea to check for road closures that may affect the morning commute. Otherwise, one may encounter significant delays arriving at the destination. While this is commonly true, motorists may be able to consult a live interactive traffic map and pick an alternate route or detour to avoid being late. However, this is not the case if one needs to catch the train which follows a single track to the terminus; if something blocks the track, there is a delay. Such is the case for the DNA replisome responsible for copying the genetic information that provides the recipe of life. When the replication machinery encounters a DNA roadblock, the outcome can be devastating if the obstacle is not overcome in an efficient manner. Fortunately, the cell\u2019s DNA synthesis apparatus can bypass certain DNA obstructions, but the mechanism(s) are still poorly understood. Very recently, two papers from the O\u2019Donnell lab, one structural (Georgescu et al., 2017 [1]) and the other biochemical (Langston and O\u2019Donnell, 2017 [2]), have challenged the conventional thinking of how the replicative CMG helicase is arranged on DNA, unwinds double-stranded DNA, and handles barricades in its path. These new findings raise important questions in the search for mechanistic insights into how DNA is copied, particularly when the replication machinery encounters a roadblock.",

RadB, a paralogue of RadA, is present in many archaeal species. RadB has previously been proposed to function as a recombination mediator, assisting in RadA-mediated strand exchange. In this study, we use the archaeon Haloferax volcanii to provide evidence to support this hypothesis. We show that RadB is required for efficient recombination and survival following treatment with DNA-damaging agents, and we identify two point mutations in radA that suppress the \u0394radB phenotype. Analysis of these point mutations leads us to propose that the role of RadB is to act as a recombination mediator, which it does by inducing a conformational change in RadA and thereby promoting its polymerisation on DNA.",

We provide genetic evidence damage. Functional DisA-YFP formed dynamic foci in exponentially growing cells, which moved through the nucleoids at a speed compatible with a DNA-scanning mode. DisA formed more static structures in the absence of RecU or RecG than in wild type cells, while dynamic foci were still observed in cells lacking the BMT RuvAB. Purified DisA synthesizes c-di-AMP, but interaction with RadA/Sms or with HJ DNA decreases DisA-mediated c-di-AMP synthesis. RadA/Sms-YFP also formed dynamic foci in growing cells, but the foci moved throughout the cells rather than just on the nucleoids, and co-localized rarely with DisA-YFP foci, suggesting that RadA/Sms and DisA interact only transiently in unperturbed conditions. Our data suggest a model in which DisA moving along dsDNA indicates absence of DNA damage/replication stress via normal c-di-AMP levels, while interaction with HJ DNA/halted forks leads to reduced c-di-AMP levels and an ensuing block in cell proliferation.

Previous reports indicate that Rad26, a yeast homolog of transcription-repair coupling factor CSB, partly mediates strand-specific repair of UV-dimers as well as AP lesions. Here, we report that Def1, known to promote ubiquitination and degradation of stalled RNA polymerase complex, also directs NER to AP lesions on the transcribed strand of an actively transcribed gene but that its function is dependent on metabolic state of the yeast cells.

RIF1 acts downstream of 53BP1, with well-documented roles in class switch recombination in B-cells and inhibition of end resection initiation in BRCA1-defective cells. Here, we report that DEAD Box 1 (DDX1), a RNA helicase also implicated in DSB repair, interacts with RIF1, with co-localization of DDX1 and RIF1 observed throughout interphase. Recruitment of DDX1 to DSBs is dependent on RIF1, with RIF1 depletion abolishing DDX1-mediated facilitation of homologous recombination at DSBs. As previously demonstrated for RIF1, DDX1 is also required for chromatin loading of Bloom syndrome helicase (BLM) to ionizing radiation-induced DSBs, a RIF1-related activity that is independent of 53BP1. We show that DDX1 and RIF1 have different nucleic acid requirements for accumulation at DSBs, with RNA-DNA hybrids required for DDX1 accrual at DSBs, and single-strand RNA required for accumulation of RIF1 at these sites. Our data suggest both convergent and divergent roles for DDX1 and RIF1 in DSB repair, and may help explain why RIF1 depletion does not fully mimic 53BP1 ablation in the restoration of homologous recombination defects in BRCA1-deficient cells.",

     "abstract": "Homology-directed repair (HDR) maintains genomic integrity by eliminating lesions such as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) and stalled replication forks and thus a deficiency in HDR is associated with genomic instability and cancer predisposition. The mechanism of HDR is best understood and most rigorously characterized in yeast. The inactivation of the fungal radiation sensitive 52 (RAD52) gene, which has both recombination mediator and single-strand annealing (SSA) activities in vitro, leads to severe HDR defects in vivo. Confusingly, however, the inactivation of murine and chicken RAD52 genes resulted in mouse and chicken cells, respectively, that were largely aphenotypic. To clarify this issue, we have generated RAD52 knockout human cell lines. Human RAD52-null cells retain a significant level of SSA activity demonstrating perforce that additional SSA-like activities must exist in human cells. Moreover, we confirmed that the SSA activity associated with RAD52 is involved in, but not absolutely required for, most HDR subpathways. Specifically, a deficiency in RAD52 impaired the repair of DNA DSBs and intriguingly decreased the random integration of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV). Finally, an analysis of pan-cancer genome data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed an association between aberrant levels of RAD52 expression and poor overall survival in multiple cancers. In toto, our work demonstrates that RAD52 contributes to the maintenance of genome stability and tumor suppression in human cells.",

     "abstract": "The implications are discussed of recently published biochemical studies on ADAR-mediated A-to-I DNA and RNA deamination at RNA:DNA hybrids. The significance of these data are related to previous work on strand-biased and codon-context mutation signatures in B lymphocytes and cancer genomes. Those studies have established that there are two significant strand biases at A:T and G:C base pairs, A-site mutations exceed T-site mutations (A\u00a0>>\u00a0T) by 2.9 fold and G-site mutations exceed C-site mutations (G\u00a0>>\u00a0C) by 1.7 fold. Both these strand biases are inconsistent with alternative \u201cDNA Deamination\u201d mechanisms, yet are expected consequences of the RNA/RT-based \u201cReverse Transcriptase\u201d mechanism of immunoglobulin (Ig) somatic hypermutation (SHM). The A-to-I DNA editing component at RNA:DNA hybrids that is likely to occur in Transcription Bubbles, while important, is of far lower A-to-I editing efficiency than in dsRNA substrates. The RNA moiety of RNA:DNA hybrids is also edited at similar lower frequencies relative to the editing rate at dsRNA substrates. Further, if the A-to-I DNA editing at RNA:DNA hybrids were the sole cause of A-to-I (read as A-to-G) mutation events for Ig SHM in vivo then the exact opposite strand biases at A:T base pairs (T\u00a0>>\u00a0A) of what is actually observed (A\u00a0>>\u00a0T) would be predicted. It is concluded that the strand-biased somatic mutation patterns at both A:T and G:C base pairs in vivo are best interpreted by the sequential steps of the RNA/RT-based mechanism. Further, the direct DNA A-to-I deamination at Transcription Bubbles is expected to contribute to the T-to-C component of the strand-biased Ig SHM spectrum.",

     "abstract": "Post-translational modifications of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) play a key role in regulating the bypass of DNA lesions during DNA replication. PCNA can be monoubiquitylated at lysine 164 by the RAD6-RAD18 ubiquitin ligase complex. Through this modification, PCNA can interact with low fidelity Y family DNA polymerases to promote translesion synthesis. Monoubiquitylated PCNA can be polyubiquitylated on lysine 63 of ubiquitin by a further ubiquitin-conjugating complex. This modification promotes a template switching bypass process in yeast, while its role in higher eukaryotes is less clear.We investigated the function of PCNA ubiquitylation using a PCNAK164R mutant DT40 chicken B lymphoblastoma cell line, which is hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents such as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), cisplatin or ultraviolet radiation (UV) due to the loss of PCNA modifications. In the PCNAK164R mutant we also detected cell cycle arrest following UV treatment, a reduced rate of damage bypass through translesion DNA synthesis on synthetic UV photoproducts, and an increased rate of genomic mutagenesis following MMS treatment. PCNA-ubiquitin fusion proteins have been reported to mimic endogenous PCNA ubiquitylation. We found that the stable expression of a PCNAK164R-ubiquitin fusion protein fully or partially rescued the observed defects of the PCNAK164R mutant. The expression of a PCNAK164R-ubiquitinK63R fusion protein, on which the formation of lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains is not possible, similarly rescued the cell cycle arrest, DNA damage sensitivity, reduction of translesion synthesis and increase of MMS-induced genomic mutagenesis. Template switching bypass was not affected by the genetic elimination of PCNA polyubiquitylation, but it was reduced in the absence of the recombination proteins BRCA1 or XRCC3.

     "abstract": "The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae divides asymmetrically, producing a new daughter cell from the original mother cell. While daughter cells are born with a full lifespan, a mother cell ages with each cell division and can only generate on average 25 daughter cells before dying. Aged yeast cells exhibit genomic instability, which is also a hallmark of human aging. However, it is unclear how this genomic instability contributes to aging. To shed light on this issue, we investigated endogenous DNA damage in S. cerevisiae during replicative aging and tested for age-dependent sensitivity to exogenous DNA damaging agents. Using live-cell imaging in a microfluidic device, we show that aging yeast cells display an increase in spontaneous Rad52 foci, a marker of endogenous DNA damage. Strikingly, this elevated DNA damage is not accompanied by increased sensitivity of aged yeast cells to genotoxic agents nor by global changes in the proteome or transcriptome that would indicate a specific \u201cDNA damage signature\u201d. These results indicate that DNA repair proficiency is not compromised in aged yeast cells, suggesting that yeast replicative aging and age-associated genomic instability is likely not a consequence of an inability to repair DNA damage.",

Deletion of NHEJ factors in P53\u2212/\u2212 mice, which are highly prone to development of T cell lymphoma, generally increases cancer incidence and shifts the tumor spectrum towards aggressive pro-B lymphoma. In contrast, Pol\u03bc deletion increased sarcoma incidence, proportionally reducing pro-B lymphoma development on the P53-deficient background.

Here, we reveal the three strategies that the simple multicellular eukaryote, C. elegans, uses to deal with DNA damage induced by light. Separately inactivating repair or replicative bypass of photo-lesions results in cellular hypersensitivity towards UV-light, but impeding repair of replication associated DNA breaks does not. Yet, we observe an unprecedented synergistic relationship when these pathways are inactivated in combination. C. elegans mutants that lack nucleotide excision repair (NER), translesion synthesis (TLS) and alternative end joining (altEJ) grow undisturbed in the dark, but become sterile when grown in light. Even exposure to very low levels of normal daylight impedes animal growth. We show that NER and TLS operate to suppress the formation of lethal DNA breaks that require polymerase theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) for their repair. Our data testifies to the enormous genotoxicity of light and to the demand of multiple layers of protection against an environmental threat that is so common.",

     "abstract": "Variations in mutation rates across the genome have been demonstrated both in model organisms and in cancers. This phenomenon is largely driven by the damage specificity of diverse mutagens and the differences in DNA repair efficiency in given genomic contexts. Here, we demonstrate that the single-strand DNA-specific cytidine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B) damages tRNA genes at a 1000-fold higher efficiency than other non-tRNA genomic regions in budding yeast. We found that A3B-induced lesions in tRNA genes were predominantly located on the non-transcribed strand, while no transcriptional strand bias was observed in protein coding genes. Furthermore, tRNA gene mutations were exacerbated in cells where RNaseH expression was completely abolished (\u0394rnh1\u0394rnh35). These data suggest a transcription-dependent mechanism for A3B-induced tRNA gene hypermutation.Interestingly, in strains proficient in DNA repair, only 1% of the abasic sites formed upon excision of A3B-deaminated cytosines were not repaired leading to mutations in tRNA genes, while 18% of these lesions failed to be repaired in the remainder of the genome. A3B-induced mutagenesis in tRNA genes was found to be efficiently suppressed by the redundant activities of both base excision repair (BER) and the error-free DNA damage bypass pathway. On the other hand, deficiencies in BER did not have a profound effect on A3B-induced mutations in CAN1, the reporter for protein coding genes. We hypothesize that differences in the mechanisms underlying ssDNA formation at tRNA genes and other genomic loci are the key determinants of the choice of the repair pathways and consequently the efficiency of DNA damage repair in these regions.Overall, our results indicate that tRNA genes are highly susceptible to ssDNA-specific DNA damaging agents. However, increased DNA repair efficacy in tRNA genes can prevent their hypermutation and maintain both genome and proteome homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "The primary pathways for DNA double strand break (DSB) repair are homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end\u2013joining (NHEJ). The choice between HR and NHEJ is influenced by the extent of DNA end resection, as extensive resection is required for HR but repressive to NHEJ. Conversely, association of the DNA end-binding protein Ku, which is integral to classical NHEJ, inhibits resection. In absence of key NHEJ components, a third repair pathway is exposed; this alternative-end joining (A-EJ) is a highly error-prone process that uses micro-homologies at the breakpoints and is initiated by DNA end resection. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the high mobility group protein Hmo1p has been implicated in controlling DNA end resection, suggesting its potential role in repair pathway choice. Using a plasmid end-joining assay, we show here that absence of Hmo1p results in reduced repair efficiency and accuracy, indicating that Hmo1p promotes end-joining; this effect is only observed on DNA with protruding ends. Notably, inhibition of DNA end resection in an hmo1\u0394 strain restores repair efficiency to the levels observed in wild-type cells. In absence of Ku, HMO1 deletion also reduces repair efficiency further, while inhibition of resection restores repair efficiency to the levels observed in ku\u0394. We suggest that Hmo1p functions to control DNA end resection, thereby preventing error-prone A-EJ repair and directing repairs towards classical NHEJ. The very low efficiency of DSB repair in ku\u0394hmo1\u0394 cells further suggests that excessive DNA resection is inhibitory for A-EJ.",

Although changes in \u03b3-H2AX activity have been studied in tumor cells in colorectal cancer (CRC), changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) have not been examined previously. We hypothesize that higher levels of irradiation-induced \u03b3-H2AX in PBLs may be associated with an elevated risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). In a case-control study, the baseline and ionizing radiation (IR)-induced \u03b3-H2AX levels in PBLs from frequency-matched 320 untreated CRC patients and 320 controls were detected by a laser scanning cytometer-based immunocytochemical method. We used unconditional multivariable logistic regression to evaluate CRC risk by using the ratio of IR-induced \u03b3-H2AX to the baseline levels with adjustment of age, sex and smoking status. We found CRC cases had significantly higher \u03b3-H2AX ratio (1.5 vs. 1.41, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) compared with controls. When using the median \u03b3-H2AX ratio of controls as a cutoff point, we found higher \u03b3-H2AX ratio was significantly associated with an increased risk of CRC (OR\u00a0=\u00a06.72, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a04.54\u20139.94). Quartile analyses also showed significant dose\u2013response relationship between higher \u03b3-H2AX ratio and increased risk of CRC (P for trend\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Age, sex, BMI and smoking status also influenced the association of \u03b3-H2AX ratio with CRC risk; however, no interactions with \u03b3-H2AX ratio were observed. These results support the premise that DSBs in peripheral blood as measured by \u03b3-H2AX level might represent an intermediate phenotype to assess the risk of CRC.

     "abstract": "DNA repair enzymes typically recognize their substrate lesions with high affinity to ensure efficient lesion repair. In UV irradiated endospores, a special thymine dimer, 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine, termed the spore photoproduct (SP), is the dominant DNA photolesion, which is rapidly repaired during spore outgrowth mainly by spore photoproduct lyase (SPL) using an unprecedented protein-harbored radical transfer process. Surprisingly, our in vitro studies using SP-containing short oligonucleotides, pUC 18 plasmid DNA, and E. coli genomic DNA found that they are all poor substrates for SPL in general, exhibiting turnover numbers of 0.01\u20130.2\u00a0min\u22121. The faster turnover numbers are reached under single turnover conditions, and SPL activity is low with oligonucleotide substrates at higher concentrations. Moreover, SP-containing oligonucleotides do not go past one turnover. In contrast, the dinucleotide SP TpT exhibits a turnover number of 0.3\u20130.4\u00a0min\u22121, and the reaction may reach up to 10 turnovers. These observations distinguish SPL from other specialized DNA repair enzymes. To the best of our knowledge, SPL represents an unprecedented example of a major DNA repair enzyme that cannot effectively repair its substrate lesion within the normal DNA conformation adopted in growing cells. Factors such as other DNA binding proteins, helicases or an altered DNA conformation may cooperate with SPL to enable efficient SP repair in germinating spores. Therefore, both SP formation and SP repair are likely to be tightly controlled by the unique cellular environment in dormant and outgrowing spore-forming bacteria, and thus SP repair may be extremely slow in non-spore-forming organisms.",

We sought to explore the sequence basis of substrate differences using a phylogeny-based design of site-directed mutations. Mutations were made for each enzyme in the vicinity of the active site and we examined these variants for glycosylase and lyase activity. Single turnover kinetics were done on a subgroup of these, comparing activity on two lesions, 5,6-dihydrouracil and 5,6-dihydrothymine, with different opposite bases. We report that wild type hNTHL1 and EcoNth are remarkably alike with respect to the specificity of the glycosylase reaction, and although hNTHL1 is a much slower enzyme than EcoNth, the tighter binding of hNTHL1 compensates, resulting in similar kcat/Kd values for both enzymes with each of the substrates tested. For the hNTHL1 variant Gln287Ala, the specificity for substrates positioned opposite G is lost, but not that of substrates positioned opposite A, suggesting a discrimination role for this residue. The EcoNth Thr121 residue influences enzyme binding to DNA, as binding is significantly reduced with the Thr121Ala variant. Finally, we present evidence that hNTHL1 Asp144, unlike the analogous EcoNth residue Asp44, may be involved in resolving the glycosylase transition state.",

This process generates a double-strand break, which must be subsequently repaired by homologous recombination. Recent work provided evidence for a new, incision-independent unhooking mechanism involving intrusion of a base excision repair (BER) enzyme, NEIL3, into the world of cross-link repair. The evidence suggests that the glycosylase action of NEIL3 unhooks interstrand cross-links derived from an abasic site or the psoralen derivative trioxsalen. If the incision-independent NEIL3 pathway is blocked, repair reverts to the incision-dependent route. In light of the new model invoking participation of NEIL3 in cross-link repair, we consider the possibility that various BER glycosylases or other DNA-processing enzymes might participate in the unhooking of chemically diverse interstrand DNA cross-links.",

In the present study, we investigated the impact of supplementation with nicotinic acid on resting and proliferating human mononuclear blood cells with a focus on DNA damage and repair processes.We observed that nicotinic acid supplementation increased NAD+ levels as well as DNA repair efficiency and enhanced genomic stability evaluated by micronucleus test after x-ray treatment. Interestingly, resting cells displayed lower basal levels of DNA breaks compared to proliferating cells, but break-induction rates were identical. Despite similar levels of p53 protein upregulation after irradiation, higher NAD+ concentrations led to reduced acetylation of this protein, suggesting enhanced SIRT1 activity.

Proper mitochondrial function is important for cellular bioenergetics and immune signaling and function.

In this study, we assessed genotoxic (mtDNA and nDNA), metabolic, and innate immune impacts of inorganic and organic mercury exposure in Caenorhabditis elegans. Genotoxic outcomes measured included DNA damage, DNA damage repair (nucleotide excision repair, NER; base excision repair, BER), and genomic copy number following MeHg and HgCl2 exposure alone and in combination with known DNA damage-inducing agents ultraviolet C radiation (UVC) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which cause bulky DNA lesions and oxidative DNA damage, respectively. Following exposure to both MeHg and HgCl2, low-level DNA damage (\u223c0.25 lesions/10\u00a0kb mtDNA and nDNA) was observed. Unexpectedly, a higher MeHg concentration reduced damage in both genomes compared to controls. However, this observation was likely the result of developmental delay. In co-exposure treatments, both mercury compounds increased initial DNA damage (mtDNA and nDNA) in combination with H2O2 exposure, but had no impact in combination with UVC exposure. Mercury exposure both increased and decreased DNA damage removal via BER. DNA repair after H2O2 exposure in mercury-exposed nematodes resulted in damage levels lower than measured in controls. Impacts to NER were not detected. mtDNA copy number was significantly decreased in the MeHg-UVC and MeHg-H2O2 co-exposure treatments. Mercury exposure had metabolic impacts (steady-state ATP levels) that differed between the compounds; HgCl2 exposure decreased these levels, while MeHg slightly increased levels or had no impact.

Furthermore, our previous study confirmed the involvement of HCAR1 in lactate-related enhancement of DNA repair in cervical cancer cells. In the present study, we examined the possible mechanisms of HCAR1-mediated enhancement of DNA repair capacity. We observed that the HCAR1 agonist dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) up-regulated BRCA1 (breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein) and NBS1 (Nijmegen breakage syndrome 1) expression in HeLa cells. Moreover, HCAR1 silencing decreased mRNA and protein levels of BRCA1 by 30% and 20%, respectively. Immunocytochemical analyses of BRCA1, nibrin and DNA-PKcs indicated an increased accumulation of these proteins in cell nuclei after DHBA stimulation. Subsequently, these changes in the DNA repair protein levels translated into an enhanced DNA repair rate after doxorubicin treatment, as shown by \u03b3-H2AX and comet assay experiments. In contrast, the down-regulation of HCAR1 decreased the efficiency of DNA repair. Finally, we observed the abrogation of DHBA-driven BRCA1 protein up-regulation and enhanced DNA repair following the preincubation of cells with the PKC inhibitor G\u00f66983.

Here, we study the structural determinants that affect the glycosidic torsion-angle of 8oxodGTP at the catalytic active site of the family X DNA polymerase from Bacillus subtilis (PolXBs). We show that, unlike most DNA polymerases, PolXBs exhibits a similar efficiency to stabilize the anti and syn conformation of 8oxodGTP at the catalytic site.

     "abstract": "Chronic exposure to arsenic, most often through contaminated drinking water, has been linked to several types of cancer in humans, including skin and lung cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying its role in causing cancer are not well understood. There is evidence that exposure to arsenic can enhance the carcinogenicity of UV light in inducing skin cancers and may enhance the carcinogenicity of tobacco smoke in inducing lung cancers. The nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway removes different types of DNA damage including those produced by UV light and components of tobacco smoke. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of sodium arsenite on the NER pathway in human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90 cells) and primary mouse keratinocytes. To measure NER, we employed a slot-blot assay to quantify the introduction and removal of UV light-induced 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PP) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). We find a concentration-dependent inhibition of the removal of 6-4 PPs and CPDs in both cell types treated with arsenite. Treatment of both cell types with arsenite resulted in a significant reduction in the abundance of XPC, a protein that is critical for DNA damage recognition in NER. The abundance of RNA expressed from several key NER genes was also significantly reduced by treatment of IMR-90 cells with arsenite. Finally, treatment of IMR-90 cells with MG-132 abrogated the reduction in XPC protein, suggesting an involvement of the proteasome in the reduction of XPC protein produced by treatment of cells with arsenic. The inhibition of NER by arsenic may reflect one mechanism underlying the role of arsenic exposure in enhancing cigarette smoke-induced lung carcinogenesis and UV light-induced skin cancer, and it may provide some insights into the emergence of arsenic trioxide as a chemotherapeutic agent.",

     "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribosylation) of proteins following DNA damage is well studied and the use of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors as therapeutic agents is an exciting prospect for the treatment of many cancers. Poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) has endo- and exoglycosidase activities which can cleave glycosidic bonds, rapidly reversing the action of PARP enzymes. Like addition of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) by PARP, removal of PAR by PARG is also thought to be required for repair of DNA strand breaks and for continued replication at perturbed forks. Here we use siRNA to show a synthetic lethal relationship between PARG and BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, FAM175A (ABRAXAS) and BARD1. In addition, we demonstrate that MCF7 cells depleted of these proteins are sensitive to Gallotannin and a novel and specific PARG inhibitor PDD00017273. We confirm that PARG inhibition increases endogenous DNA damage, stalls replication forks and increases homologous recombination, and propose that it is the lack of homologous recombination (HR) proteins at PARG inhibitor-induced stalled replication forks that induces cell death. Interestingly not all genes that are synthetically lethal with PARP result in sensitivity to PARG inhibitors, suggesting that although there is overlap, the functions of PARP and PARG may not be completely identical. These data together add further evidence to the possibility that single treatment therapy with PARG inhibitors could be used for treatment of certain HR deficient tumours and provide insight into the relationship between PARP, PARG and the processes of DNA repair.",

     "abstract": "DNA repair pathway is a primary defense system that eliminates wide varieties of DNA damage. Any deficiencies in them are likely to cause the chromosomal instability that leads to cell malfunctioning and tumorigenesis. Genetic polymorphisms in DNA repair genes have demonstrated a significant association with cancer risk.Our study attempts to give a glimpse of the overall scenario of the germline polymorphisms in the DNA repair genes by taking into account of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database as well as the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) for evaluating the disease link, particularly in cancer.It has been found that ExAC DNA repair dataset (which consists of 228 DNA repair genes) comprises 30.4% missense, 12.5% dbSNP reported and 3.2% ClinVar significant variants. 27% of all the missense variants has the deleterious SIFT score of 0.00 and 6% variants carrying the most damaging Polyphen-2 score of 1.00, thus affecting the protein structure and function. However, as per HGMD, only a fraction (1.2%) of ExAC DNA repair variants was found to be cancer-related, indicating remaining variants reported in both the databases to be further analyzed. This, in turn, may provide an increased spectrum of the reported cancer linked variants in the DNA repair genes present in ExAC database.Moreover, further in silico functional assay of the identified vital cancer-associated variants, which is essential to get their actual biological significance, may shed some lights in the field of targeted drug development in near future.",

     "abstract": "It has been shown that complex childhood traumatization (CCT) increases the risk for severe somatic and mental disorders. However, the somatic pathways linking maladaptive affect regulation and disease are not understood. Here we tested the hypothesis that traumatic stress is linked to the induction of DNA damage. We isolated peripheral lymphocytes (PBLCs) from blood of healthy donors and patients suffering from CCT. Cells were immobilised on slides and stained with anti-phosphohistone 2AX (\u03b3H2AX). The number of \u03b3H2AX foci, which are an accepted surrogate marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), was determined and set in relation to the patient characteristics. We show that CCT patients (HS) have higher levels of DSBs in PBLCs than healthy volunteers (CG) and psychiatric patients without CCT (LS) (HS: 0.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46 foci/cell; LS: 0.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23 foci/cell; CG: 0.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10 foci/cell). The difference between HS and control group was highly significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Insecure-dismissing attachment as a psychological marker was related to an increase in the \u03b3H2AX foci in all groups, but especially in the CCT patients. There was no significant correlation in the \u03b3H2AX level to potential external genotoxic influences such as smoking and alcohol consumption. In PBLCs, spontaneous occurring \u03b3H2AX foci partially colocalized with 53BP1 and pATM, supporting the notion they represent DSBs. Overall, our data indicate that complex traumatization is a source of genotoxic stress that can cause systemic DNA damage, pointing to the importance of emotional early life experiences for the genetically determined health status in later life periods. The finding of CCT to be interrelated to genomic instability opens new opportunities for a deeper understanding of the link between emotional stress, DNA damage and somatic disorders.",

     "abstract": "Cells carrying deletions of genes encoding H-class ribonucleases display elevated rates of chromosome instability. The role of these enzymes is to remove RNA-DNA associations including persistent mRNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) formed during transcription, and ribonucleotides incorporated into DNA during replication. RNases H1 and H2 can degrade the RNA component of R-loops, but only RNase H2 can initiate accurate ribonucleotide excision repair (RER). In order to examine the specific contributions of these activities to chromosome stability, we measured rates of loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) in diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains carrying the rnh201-RED separation-of-function allele, encoding a version of RNase H2 that is RE R- d efective, but partly retains its other activity. The LOH rate in rnh201-RED was intermediate between RNH201 and rnh201\u0394. In strains carrying a mutant version of DNA polymerase \u03b5 (pol2-M644G) that incorporates more ribonucleotides than normal, the LOH rate in rnh201-RED was as high as the rate measured in rnh201\u0394. Topoisomerase 1 cleavage at sites of ribonucleotide incorporation has been recently shown to produce DNA double strand breaks. Accordingly, in both the POL2 and pol2-M644G backgrounds, the LOH elevation in rnh201-RED was suppressed by top1\u0394. In contrast, in strains that incorporate fewer ribonucleotides (pol2-M644L) the LOH rate in rnh201-RED was low and independent of topoisomerase 1. These results suggest that both R-loop removal and RER contribute substantially to chromosome stability, and that their relative contributions may be variable across different regions of the genome. In this scenario, a prominent contribution of R-loop removal may be expected at highly transcribed regions, whereas RER may play a greater role at hotspots of ribonucleotide incorporation.",

Nucleotide excision repair acts on lesions that distort DNA helix, mismatch repair on mispaired bases, and homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining on double stranded breaks. Post-replication repair that overcomes replication blocks caused by DNA damage also plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from the deleterious effects of oxidative DNA damage.

Furthermore, oxidative stress, which is responsible for majority of DNA lesions, affects Wnt signaling in different ways. A better understanding of the cross-talk between these pathways and events could provide strategies for treatment of cancer cells with deficient DNA repair capacity. As such, we will give a brief overview of the importance of the DNA repair machinery, signaling mechanisms of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, and DDR.

High toxicity of used chemotherapeutics and resistance of cancer cells to treatments are a driving force for searching the new drug candidates for breast cancer therapy. In this study, we tested the antiproliferative effects of a series of benzofuran-2-acetic methyl ester derivatives, synthesized by a palladium-catalyzed carbonylative heterocyclization approach, on breast cancer cells. We observed that benzofuran compounds bearing a phenyl or tert-butyl substituent \u03b1 to the methoxycarbonyl group significantly inhibited anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in human estrogen receptor alpha positive (MCF-7 and T47D) and in triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, without affecting growth of MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells. Mechanistically, benzofuran derivatives enhanced the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip/WAF1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels and this occurs transcriptionally in an Sp1-dependent manner. Moreover, benzofuran derivatives induced apoptosis, increased poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio along with a marked DNA fragmentation along with a marked DNA fragmentation and a strong increase in TUNEL-positive breast cancer cells. Overall, we provide evidence that the newly tested benzofuran derivatives showed antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activities against breast cancer cells regardless estrogen receptor status, suggesting their possible clinical development as anticancer agents.",

Among DDR activated processes, the repair of DSBs by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) is essential. The proper coordination of NHEJ factors is mainly achieved through phosphorylation by an ATM-related kinase, the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), although the molecular basis for this regulation has yet to be fully elucidated. In this study we identify the major NHEJ DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase lambda (Pol\u03bb), as a target for both ATM and DNA-PKcs in human cells. We show that Pol\u03bb is efficiently phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs in vitro and predominantly by ATM after DSB induction with ionizing radiation (IR) in vivo. We identify threonine 204 (T204) as a main target for ATM/DNA-PKcs phosphorylation on human Pol\u03bb, and establish that its phosphorylation may facilitate the repair of a subset of IR-induced DSBs and the efficient Pol\u03bb-mediated gap-filling during NHEJ. Molecular evidence suggests that Pol\u03bb phosphorylation might favor Pol\u03bb interaction with the DNA-PK complex at DSBs. Altogether, our work provides the first demonstration of how Pol\u03bb is regulated by phosphorylation to connect with the NHEJ core machinery during DSB repair in human cells.",

     "abstract": "Interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) are covalent lesions formed by cisplatin. The mechanism for the processing and removal of ICLs by DNA repair proteins involves nucleotide excision repair (NER), homologous recombination (HR) and fanconi anemia (FA) pathways. In this report, we monitored the processing of a flanking uracil adjacent to a cisplatin ICL by the proteins involved in the base excision repair (BER) pathway. Using a combination of extracts, purified proteins, inhibitors, functional assays and cell culture studies, we determined the specific BER proteins required for processing a DNA substrate with a uracil adjacent to a cisplatin ICL. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) is the primary glycosylase responsible for the removal of uracils adjacent to cisplatin ICLs, whereas other uracil glycosylases can process uracils in the context of undamaged DNA. Repair of the uracil adjacent to cisplatin ICLs proceeds through the classical BER pathway, highlighting the importance of specific proteins in this redundant pathway. Removal of uracil is followed by the generation of an abasic site and subsequent cleavage by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1). Inhibition of either the repair or redox domain of APE1 gives rise to cisplatin resistance. Inhibition of the lyase domain of Polymerase \u03b2 (Pol\u03b2) does not influence cisplatin cytotoxicity. In addition, lack of XRCC1 leads to increased DNA damage and results in increased cisplatin cytotoxicity. Our results indicate that BER activation at cisplatin ICLs influences crosslink repair and modulates cisplatin cytotoxicity via specific UNG, APE1 and Pol\u03b2 polymerase functions.",

Here, we investigate the contribution of the dynamics in the Zn3hp structural element to various activities of UvrA during the early steps of NER. By restricting the movement of the Zn3hp using disulfide crosslinking, we showed that the movement of the Zn3hp is required for damage-specific binding, UvrB loading and ATPase activities of UvrA. We individually inactivated each of the nucleotide binding sites in UvrA to investigate its role in the movement of the Zn3hp.

Their contribution to the DNA damage response in intact tissue in vivo has not, however, been demonstrated. Here we compare DNA damage sensitivity in the testes of wild-type mice versus mice bearing a null allele of the NONO homologue (Nono gt). In wild-type mice, NONO protein was present in Sertoli, peritubular myoid, and interstitial cells, with an increase in expression following induction of DNA damage. As expected for the product of an X-linked gene, NONO was not detected in germ cells. The Nono gt/0 mice had at most a mild testis developmental phenotype in the absence of genotoxic stress. However, following irradiation at sublethal, 2\u20134 Gy doses, Nono gt/0 mice displayed a number of indicators of radiosensitivity as compared to their wild-type counterparts. These included higher levels of persistent DSB repair foci, increased numbers of apoptotic cells in the seminiferous tubules, and partial degeneration of the blood-testis barrier. There was also an almost complete loss of germ cells at later times following irradiation, evidently arising as an indirect effect reflecting loss of stromal support.

     "abstract": "Among different DNA repair processes that cells use to face with DNA damage, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is particularly important for the removal of a high variety of lesions, including those generated by some antitumor drugs. A number of factors participating in NER, such as the TFIIH complex and the endonuclease XPG are also involved in basal processes, e.g. transcription. For this reason, localization of these factors at DNA damage sites may be difficult. Here we have applied a mild digestion of chromatin with DNase I to improve the in situ extraction necessary to detect chromatin-bound proteins by immunofluorescence. We have compared this method with different extraction protocols and investigated its application on different cell types, and with different antibodies. Our results show that a short DNase I treatment before the immunoreaction, enhances the fluorescence signal of NER proteins, such as XPG, DDB2 and XPC. In addition, our findings indicate that the antibody choice is a critical factor for accurate localization of DNA repair proteins at DNA damage sites. In conclusion, a mild DNA digestion with DNase I improves the immunofluorescence detection of the recruitment of NER factors at local DNA damage sites by enhancing accessibility to the antibodies, independently of the cell type.",

     "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is an essential, widely conserved mechanism that utilizes a template for accurate repair of DNA breaks. Some early HR models, developed over five decades ago, anticipated single-strand breaks (nicks) as initiating lesions. Subsequent studies favored a more double-strand break (DSB)-centered view of HR initiation and at present this pathway is primarily considered to be associated with DSB repair. However, mounting evidence suggests that nicks can indeed initiate HR directly, without first being converted to DSBs. Moreover, recent studies reported on novel branches of nick-initiated HR (nickHR) that rely on single-, rather than double-stranded repair templates and that are characterized by mechanistically and genetically unique properties. The physiological significance of nickHR is not well documented, but its high-fidelity nature and low mutagenic potential are relevant in recently developed, precise gene editing approaches. Here, we review the evidence for stimulation of HR by nicks, as well as the data on the interactions of nickHR with other DNA repair pathways and on its mechanistic properties. We conclude that nickHR is a bona-fide pathway for nick repair, sharing the molecular machinery with the canonical HR but nevertheless characterized by unique properties that secure its inclusion in DNA repair models and warrant future investigations.",

     "abstract": "This pilot study was carried out to assess the effect of radio-contaminated Chernobyl environment on plant genome integrity 27 years after the accident. For this purpose, nuclei were isolated from root tips of the soybean seedlings harvested from plants grown in the Chernobyl area for seven generations. Neutral, neutral-alkaline, and methylation-sensitive comet assays were performed to evaluate the induction and repair of primary DNA damage and the epigenetic contribution to stress adaptation mechanisms. An increased level of single and double strand breaks in the radio-contaminated Chernobyl seedlings at the stage of primary root development was detected in comparison to the controls. However, the kinetics of the recovery of DNA breaks of radio-contaminated Chernobyl samples revealed that lesions were efficiently repaired at the stage of cotyledon. Methylation-sensitive comet assay revealed comparable levels in the CCGG methylation pattern between control and radio-contaminated samples with a slight increase of approximately 10% in the latter ones. The obtained preliminary data allow us to speculate about the onset of mechanisms providing an adaptation potential to the accumulated internal irradiation after the Chernobyl accident.Despite the limitations of this study, we showed that comet assay is a sensitive and flexible technique which can be efficiently used for genotoxic screening of plant specimens in natural and human-made radio-contaminated areas, as well as for safety monitoring of agricultural products.",

We examined the effects of the PCNAS228I mutation that causes PCNA-associated DNA repair disorder (PARD). Cells from individuals affected by PARD are sensitive to the PCNA inhibitors T3 and T2AA, showing that the S228I mutation has consequences for undamaged cells. Analysis of the binding between PCNA and PCNA-interacting proteins (PIPs) shows that the S228I change dramatically impairs the majority of these interactions, including that of Cdt1, DNMT1, PolD3p66 and PolD4p12. In contrast p21 largely retains the ability to bind PCNAS228I. This property is conferred by the p21 PIP box sequence itself, which is both necessary and sufficient for PCNAS228I binding. Ubiquitination of PCNA is unaffected by the S228I change, which indirectly alters the structure of the inter-domain connecting loop. Despite the dramatic in vitro effects of the PARD mutation on PIP-degron binding, there are only minor alterations to the stability of p21 and Cdt1 in cells from affected individuals. Overall our data suggests that reduced affinity of PCNAS228I for specific clients causes subtle cellular defects in undamaged cells which likely contribute to the etiology of PARD.",

Drug combinations may overcome these limitations by allowing fewer chemoresistant cells to survive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic potential of hesperetin to osteosarcoma and to analyze the cell cycle effects of combinations of hesperetin with chemotherapeutic agents. For this, the U2OS human osteosarcoma cell line was exposed to hesperetin or hesperetin combined with etoposide or doxorubicin in defined proportions. Hesperetin was less cytotoxic compared to chemotherapeutic agents, as shown by cell growth, viability and clonogenic assays. Notwithstanding, hesperetin combined with etoposide showed additive effects on the inhibition of cell growth. Furthermore, hesperetin induced G2-phase arrest, associated with decreased gene expression of cyclins B1 and E1 and cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2. The combination with higher additive effect resulted in higher percentage of cells in G2-phase, showing that G2-phase arrest is associated with cytotoxicity. Moreover, hesperetin induced cytostatic effects. In conclusion, our results suggest that G2-phase arrest is an important step for hesperetin-induced cytotoxicity in U2OS cells. Hesperetin shows potential cytotoxicity when combined with etoposide, which may have implications on therapeutic developments for osteosarcoma.",

We found that the efficiency of AP site cleavage by APE1 was affected by the benzo[a]pyrenyl-DNA adduct (BPDE-dG) in the opposite strand. AP sites directly opposite of the modified dG or shifted toward the 5\u2032 direction were hydrolyzed by APE1 with an efficiency moderately lower than the AP site in the control DNA duplex, whereas AP sites shifted toward the 3\u2032 direction were hydrolyzed significantly less efficiently. For all DNA structures except DNA with the AP site shifted by 3 nucleotides in the 3\u2032 direction (AP+3-BP-DNA), hydrolysis was more efficient in the case of (+)-trans-BPDE-dG. Using molecular dynamic simulation, we have shown that in the complex of APE1 with the AP+3-BP-DNA, the BP residue is located within the DNA bend induced by APE1 and contacts the amino acids in the enzyme catalytic center and the catalytic metal ion. The geometry of the APE1 active site is perturbed more significantly by the trans-isomer of BPDE-dG that intercalates into the APE1-DNA complex near the cleaved phosphodiester bond. The ability of DNA polymerases \u03b2 (Pol\u03b2), \u03bb and \u03b9 to catalyze gap-filling synthesis in cooperation with APE1 was also analyzed. Pol\u03b2 was shown to inhibit the 3\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a05\u2032 exonuclease activity of APE1 when both enzymes were added simultaneously and to insert the correct nucleotide into the gap arising after AP site hydrolysis. Therefore, further evidence for the functional cooperation of APE1 and Pol\u03b2 in base excision repair was obtained.",

     "abstract": "Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes is triggered by the activity of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). AID induces DNA lesions in variable regions of Ig genes, and error-prone DNA repair mechanisms initiated in response to these lesions introduce the mutations that characterize SHM. Error-prone DNA repair in SHM is proposed to be mediated by low-fidelity DNA polymerases such as those that mediate trans-lesion synthesis (TLS); however, the mechanism by which these enzymes are recruited to AID-induced lesions remains unclear. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the sliding clamp for multiple DNA polymerases, undergoes Rad6/Rad18-dependent ubiquitination in response to DNA damage. Ubiquitinated PCNA promotes the replacement of the replicative DNA polymerase stalled at the site of a DNA lesion with a TLS polymerase. To examine the potential role of Rad18-dependent PCNA ubiquitination in SHM, we analyzed Ig gene mutations in Rad18 knockout (KO) mice immunized with T cell-dependent antigens. We found that SHM in Rad18 KO mice was similar to wild-type mice, suggesting that Rad18 is dispensable for SHM. However, residual levels of ubiquitinated PCNA were observed in Rad18 KO cells, indicating that Rad18-independent PCNA ubiquitination might play a role in SHM.",

     "abstract": "The evolutionally conserved Fun30 chromatin remodeler in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to contribute to cellular resistance to genotoxic stress inflicted by camptothecin (CPT), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and hydroxyurea (HU). Fun30 aids in extensive DNA resection of DNA double stranded break (DSB) ends, which is thought to underlie its role in CPT-resistance. How Fun30 promotes MMS- or HU-resistance has not been resolved. Interestingly, we have recently found Fun30 to also play a negative role in cellular tolerance to MMS and HU in the absence of the Rad5-dependent DNA damage tolerance pathway. In this report, we show that Fun30 acts to down regulate Rad9-dependent DNA damage checkpoint triggered by CPT or MMS, but does not affect Rad9-independent intra-S phase replication checkpoint induced by MMS or HU. These results support the notion that Fun30 contributes to cellular response to DSBs by preventing excessive DNA damage checkpoint activation in addition to its role in facilitating DNA end resection. On the other hand, we present evidence suggesting that Fun30\u2019s negative function in MMS- and HU-tolerance in the absence of Rad5 is not related to its regulation of checkpoint activity. Moreover, we find Fun30 to be cell cycle regulated with its abundance peaking in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Importantly, we demonstrate that artificially restricting Fun30 expression to G2/M does not affect its positive or negative function in genotoxin-resistance, but confining Fun30 to S phase abolishes its functions. These results indicate that both positive and negative functions of Fun30 in DNA damage response occur mainly in G2/M phase.",

     "abstract": "In 2003, we reported that 129-derived strains of mice carry a naturally occurring nonsense mutation at codon 27 of the Poli gene that would produce a pol\u03b9 peptide of just 26 amino acids, rather then the full-length 717 amino acid wild-type polymerase. In support of the genomic analysis, no pol\u03b9 protein was detected in testes extracts from 129X1/SvJmice, where wild-type pol\u03b9 is normally highly expressed. The early truncation in pol\u03b9 occurs before any structural domains of the polymerase are synthesized and as a consequence, we reasoned that 129-derived strains of mice should be considered as functionally defective in pol\u03b9 activity. However, it has recently been reported that during the maturation of the Poli mRNA in 129-derived strains, exon- 2 is sometimes skipped and that an exon-2-less pol\u03b9 protein of 675 amino acids is synthesized that retains catalytic activity in vitro and in vivo. From a structural perspective, we found this idea untenable, given that the amino acids encoded by exon-2 include residues critical for the coordination of the metal ions required for catalysis, as well as the structural integrity of the DNA polymerase. To determine if the exon-2-less pol\u03b9 isoform possesses catalytic activity in vitro, we have purified a glutathione-tagged full-length exon-2-less (675 amino acid) pol\u03b9 protein from baculovirus infected insect cells and compared the activity of the isoform to full-length (717 amino acid) GST-tagged wild-type mouse pol\u03b9 in vitro. Reaction conditions were performed under a range of magnesium or manganese concentrations, as well as different template sequence contexts. Wild-type mouse pol\u03b9 exhibited robust characteristic properties previously associated with human pol\u03b9\u2019s biochemical properties. However, we did not detect any polymerase activity associated with the exon-2-less pol\u03b9 enzyme under the same reaction conditions and conclude that exon-2-less pol\u03b9 is indeed rendered catalytically inactive in vitro.",

These mice were widely used as a Pol \u03b9-null model for in vivo studies of the Pol \u03b9 function. However whether 129-derived strains of mice are fully deficient in the Pol \u03b9 functions was a subject of discussion since Pol \u03b9 mRNA undergoes alternative splicing at exon 2. Here we report purification of mouse Pol \u03b9 lacking the region encoded by exon 2, which includes several conserved residues involved in catalysis. We show that the deletion abrogates both the DNA polymerase and dRP lyase activities of Pol \u03b9 in the presence of either Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions. Thus, 129-derived strains of mice express catalytically inactive alternatively spliced Pol \u03b9 variant, whose cellular functions, if any exist, remain to be established.",

Dysfunctional telomeres are recognized as DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), and elicit the activation of a DNA damage response (DDR). We have previously reported that DSBs near telomeres are poorly repaired, resulting in a high frequency of large deletions and gross chromosome rearrangements (GCRs). Our previous genetic studies have demonstrated that this sensitivity of telomeric regions to DSBs is a result of excessive processing. In the current study, we have further investigated the sensitivity of telomeric regions to DSBs through the analysis of repair proteins associated with DSBs at interstitial and telomeric sites. Following the inducible expression of I-SceI endonuclease, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and real-time quantitative PCR were used to compare the recruitment of repair proteins at I-SceI-induced DSBs at interstitial and subtelomeric sites. We observed that proteins that are specifically associated with processing of DSBs during homologous recombination repair, RAD51, BRCA1, and CtIP, are present at a much greater abundance at subtelomeric DSBs. In contrast, Ku70, which is specifically involved in classical nonhomologous end joining, showed no difference at interstitial and subtelomeric DSBs. Importantly, ATM was lower in abundance at subtelomeric DSBs, while ATR was in greater abundance at subtelomeric DSBs, consistent with the accumulation of processed DSBs near telomeres, since processing is accompanied by a transition from ATM to ATR binding. Combined, our results suggest that excessive processing is responsible for the increased frequency of large deletions and GCRs at DSBs near telomeres.",

Some multiple and long polymorphic CAG repeats were observed to have variable length in the striatum of aged mice.

     "abstract": "Human Y-family DNA polymerase kappa (pol\u03ba) is specialized to bypass bulky lesions in DNA in an error-free way, thus protecting cells from carcinogenic bulky DNA adducts. Benzo[a]pyrene (BP) is one of the most ubiquitous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and an environmental carcinogen. BP covalently modifies DNA and generates mutagenic, bulky adducts. The major BP adduct formed in cells is 10S (+)-trans-anti-BP-N2-dG adduct (BP-dG), which is associated with cancer. The molecular mechanism of how pol\u03ba replicates BP-dG accurately is not clear. Here we report the structure of pol\u03ba captured at the lesion-extension stage: the enzyme is extending the primer strand after the base pair containing the BP-dG adduct in the template strand at the \u22121 position. Pol\u03ba accommodates the BP adduct in the nascent DNA\u2019s minor groove and keeps the adducted DNA helix in a B-form. Two water molecules cover the edge of the minor groove of the replicating base pair (0 position), which is secured by the BP ring in the \u22121 position in a 5\u2032 orientation. The 5\u2032 oriented BP adduct keeps correct Watson-Crick base pairing in the active site and promotes high fidelity replication. Our structural and biochemical data reveal a unique molecular basis for accurate DNA replication right after the bulky lesion BP-dG.",

     "abstract": "Human PrimPol is a recently discovered bifunctional enzyme that displays DNA template-directed primase and polymerase activities. PrimPol has been implicated in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication fork progression and restart as well as DNA lesion bypass. Published evidence suggests that PrimPol is a Mn2+-dependent enzyme as it shows significantly improved primase and polymerase activities when binding Mn2+, rather than Mg2+, as a divalent metal ion cofactor. Consistently, our fluorescence anisotropy assays determined that PrimPol binds to a primer/template DNA substrate with affinities of 29 and 979\u00a0nM in the presence of Mn2+ and Mg2+, respectively. Our pre-steady-state kinetic analysis revealed that PrimPol incorporates correct dNTPs with 100-fold higher efficiency with Mn2+ than with Mg2+. Notably, the substitution fidelity of PrimPol in the presence of Mn2+ was determined to be in the range of 3.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22122 to 3.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22121, indicating that PrimPol is an error-prone polymerase. Furthermore, we kinetically determined the sugar selectivity of PrimPol to be 57\u20131800 with Mn2+ and 150\u20134500 with Mg2+, and found that PrimPol was able to incorporate the triphosphates of two anticancer drugs (cytarabine and gemcitabine), but not two antiviral drugs (emtricitabine and lamivudine).",

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes are duplicated by a complex machinery, utilizing high fidelity replicative B-family DNA polymerases (pols) \u03b1, \u03b4 and \u03b5. Specialized error-prone pol \u03b6, the fourth B-family member, is recruited when DNA synthesis by the accurate trio is impeded by replication stress or DNA damage. The damage tolerance mechanism dependent on pol \u03b6 prevents DNA/genome instability and cell death at the expense of increased mutation rates. The pol switches occurring during this specialized replication are not fully understood. The loss of pol \u03b6 results in the absence of induced mutagenesis and suppression of spontaneous mutagenesis. Disruption of the Fe-S cluster motif that abolish the interaction of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the catalytic subunit of pol \u03b6 with its accessory subunits, which are shared with pol \u03b4, leads to a similar defect in induced mutagenesis. Intriguingly, the pol3-13 mutation that affects the Fe-S cluster in the CTD of the catalytic subunit of pol \u03b4 also leads to defective induced mutagenesis, suggesting the possibility that Fe-S clusters are essential for the pol switches during replication of damaged DNA. We confirmed that yeast strains with the pol3-13 mutation are UV-sensitive and defective in UV-induced mutagenesis. However, they have increased spontaneous mutation rates. We found that this increase is dependent on functional pol \u03b6. In the pol3-13 mutant strain with defective pol \u03b4, there is a sharp increase in transversions and complex mutations, which require functional pol \u03b6, and an increase in the occurrence of large deletions, whose size is controlled by pol \u03b6. Therefore, the pol3-13 mutation abrogates pol \u03b6-dependent induced mutagenesis, but allows for pol \u03b6 recruitment for the generation of spontaneous mutations and prevention of larger deletions. These results reveal differential control of the two major types of pol \u03b6-dependent mutagenesis by the Fe-S cluster present in replicative pol \u03b4.",

     "abstract": "Prediabetes is the preclinical stage of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with intermediate state of hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia results in a state of oxidative stress, which may contribute to the production of insulin resistance, \u03b2-cell dysfunction and long-term complications of diabetes. Novel approaches are required for prevention and treatment of diabetes. New biomarkers that can be used in risk stratification and therapy control as supplementary to current parameters are needed. These biomarkers may facilitate a more individualized and sufficient treatment of diabetes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the levels of oxidatively induced DNA damage products, 8-oxo-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) (also known as 8-OH-dG), (5\u2032R)- and (5\u2032S)-8,5\u2032-cyclo-2\u2032-deoxyadenosines (R-cdA and S-cdA), and the lipid peroxidation product 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1) as reliable oxidative stress markers in patients with prediabetes or T2DM in comparison with healthy volunteers. Urine samples were collected from these subjects. Absolute quantification of 8-oxo-dG, R-cdA, S-cdA and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 was achieved by liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. The levels of 8-oxo-dG, S-cdA and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 were significantly greater in prediabetes patients than those in healthy volunteers. T2DM patients also had higher levels of 8-oxo-dG than healthy volunteers. No statistically significant difference was observed for R-cdA levels. 8-Oxo-dG levels positively correlated with R-cdA and S-cdA levels for prediabetes and newly diagnosed T2DM. S-cdA levels and HbA1c were found negatively correlated in prediabetes patients. Also 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels and HbA1c were found negatively correlated in prediabetes patients. These results indicate that oxidatively induced macromolecular damage appears before the establishment of T2DM. Thus, our data suggest that oxidatively induced DNA damage and lipid peroxidation products that were found to be elevated in prediabetic stage may be used as early disease markers in patients at risk for T2DM.",

PARylation is involved in various cellular processes such as DNA repair in case of base excision and strand-breaks.Strand-breaks (SSB and DSB) are detrimental to cell viability and, in Drosophila, that has a unique PARP family organization, little is known on PARP involvement in the control of strand-breaks repair process. In our study, strands-breaks (SSB and DSB) are chemically induced in S2 Drosophila cells using bleomycin. These breaks are efficiently repaired in S2 cells. During the bleomycin treatment, changes in PARylation levels are only detectable in a few cells, and an increase in PARP-I and PARP-II mRNAs is only observed during the recovery period. These results differ strongly from those obtained with Human cells, where PARylation is strongly activating when DNA breaks are generated. Finally, in PARP knock-down cells, DNA stability is altered but no change in strand-breaks repair can be observed.PARP responses in DNA strands-breaks context are functional in Drosophila model as demonstrated by PARP-I and PARP-II mRNA increases. However, no modification of the global PARylation profile is observed during strand-breaks generation, only changes at cellular levels are detectable. Taking together, these results demonstrate that PARylation process in Drosophila is tightly regulated in the context of strands-breaks repair and that PARP is essential during the maintenance of DNA integrity but dispensable in the DNA repair process.",

In this study, we discovered that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cofactor of BER, promoted CAG repeat deletion and removal of a CAG repeat hairpin during BER in a duplex CAG repeat tract and CAG hairpin loop, respectively. We showed that PCNA stimulated LIG I activity on a nick across a small template loop during BER in a duplex (CAG)20 repeat tract promoting small repeat deletions. Surprisingly, we found that during BER in a hairpin loop, PCNA promoted reannealing of the upstream flap of a double-flap intermediate, thereby facilitating the formation of a downstream flap and stimulating FEN1 cleavage activity and hairpin removal. Our results indicate that PCNA plays a critical role in preventing CAG repeat expansions by modulating the structures of dynamic DNA via cooperation with BER enzymes.

     "abstract": "Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases are important DNA repair enzymes involved in two overlapping pathways: DNA glycosylase-initiated base excision (BER) and AP endonuclease-initiated nucleotide incision repair (NIR). In the BER pathway, AP endonucleases cleave DNA at AP sites and 3'-blocking moieties generated by DNA glycosylases, whereas in NIR, the same AP endonucleases incise DNA 5' to a wide variety of oxidized bases. The flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana contains three genes encoding homologues of major human AP endonuclease 1 (APE1): Arp, Ape1L and Ape2. It has been shown that all three proteins contain AP site cleavage and 3'-repair phosphodiesterase activities; however, it was not known whether the plant AP endonucleases contain the NIR activity. Here, we report that ARP proteins from Arabidopsis and common wheat (Triticum aestivum) contain NIR and 3'\u00a0\u2192\u00a05' exonuclease activities in addition to their AP endonuclease and 3'-repair phosphodiesterase functions. The steady-state kinetic parameters of reactions indicate that Arabidopsis ARP cleaves oligonucleotide duplexes containing \u03b1-anomeric 2'-deoxyadenosine (\u03b1dA) and 5,6-dihydrouridine (DHU) with efficiencies (kcat/KM\u00a0=\u00a0134 and 7.3 \u03bcM\u22121\u00b7min\u22121, respectively) comparable to those of the human counterpart.

Interestingly, homozygous A. thaliana arp\u2013/\u2013 mutant exhibited high sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, but not to H2O2, suggesting that ARP is a major plant AP endonuclease that removes abasic sites and specific types of oxidative DNA base damage.

However, increased steady-state levels of ROS-induced DNA base damage have not been reported after chronic UV exposure. Accumulation of ROS-induced DNA base damage is governed by rates of lesion formation and repair. Repair is generally performed by Base Excision Repair (BER), which is initiated by DNA glycosylases, such as 8-oxoguanine glycosylase and Nei-Endonuclease VIII-Like 1 (NEIL1). In the current study, UV light (UVB) was used to elicit protracted low-level ROS challenge in wild-type (WT) and Neil1\u2212/\u2212 mouse skin.

In WT mice, chronic UVB exposure led to increased steady-state levels of FapyGua, FapyAde, and ThyGly with no significant increases in 8-OH-Gua or 5,6-diOH-Ura.

To combat this threat, a suite of DNA repair pathways cooperate to repair numerous types of DNA damage. If left unrepaired, these damages can result in the accumulation of mutations which can lead to deleterious consequences including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is highly conserved from bacteria to humans and is primarily responsible for the removal and subsequent repair of toxic and mutagenic oxidative DNA lesions. Although the biochemical steps that occur in the BER pathway have been well defined, little is known about how the BER machinery is regulated. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model system to biochemically and genetically dissect BER. BER is initiated by DNA N-glycosylases, such as S. cerevisiae Ntg1. Previous work demonstrates that Ntg1 is post-translationally modified by SUMO in response to oxidative DNA damage suggesting that this modification could modulate the function of Ntg1. In this study, we mapped the specific sites of SUMO modification within Ntg1 and identified the enzymes responsible for sumoylating/desumoylating Ntg1. Using a non-sumoylatable version of Ntg1, ntg1\u0394SUMO, we performed an initial assessment of the functional impact of Ntg1 SUMO modification in the cellular response to DNA damage. Finally, we demonstrate that, similar to Ntg1, the human homologue of Ntg1, NTHL1, can also be SUMO-modified in response to oxidative stress. Our results suggest that SUMO modification of BER proteins could be a conserved mechanism to coordinate cellular responses to DNA damage.",

In particular, DNA dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), a major player in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair process, seems to represent a valuable target for innovative anti-neoplastic therapies in cancer. DNA-PKcs levels are strongly upregulated and associated with a poor clinical outcome in various tumor types, including HCC. Importantly, DNA-PKcs not only protects tumor cells from harmful DNA insults coming either from the microenvironment or chemotherapeutic drug treatments, but also possesses additional properties, independent from its DNA repair activity, that provide growth advantages to cancer cells. These properties (metabolic and gene reprogramming, invasiveness and metastasis, resistance to apoptosis, etc.) have started to be elucidated. In the present review, we summarize the physiologic and oncogenic roles of DNA-PKcs, with a special emphasis on liver cancer. In particular, this work focuses on the molecular mechanism whereby DNA-PKcs exerts its pro-tumorigenic activity in cancer cells. In addition, the upstream regulator of DNA-PKcs activation as well as its downstream effectors thus far identified are illustrated. Furthermore, the potential therapeutic strategies aimed at inhibiting DNA-PKcs activity in HCC are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway in eukaryotes that repairs a double-strand break (DSB) by copying homologous sequences from a sister chromatid, a homologous chromosome or an ectopic location. Recombination is challenged by the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes, which may impair the process at many steps, from resection of the DSB ends to the re-establishement of nucleosomes after repair. However, nucleosome dynamics during DSB repair have not been well described, primarily because of a lack of well-ordered nucleosomes around a DSB. We designed a system in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to monitor nucleosome dynamics during repair of an HO endonuclease-induced DSB. Nucleosome occupancy around the break is lost following DSB formation, by 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 resection of the DSB end. Soon after repair is complete, nucleosome occupancy is partially restored in a repair-dependent but cell cycle-independent manner. Full re-establishment of nucleosome protection back to the level prior to DSB induction is achieved when the cell cycle resumes following repair. These findings may have implications to the mechanisms by which cells sense the completion of repair.",

Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the association of XRCC1 with lung cancer, followed by data mining analysis which included both Multi-dimensionality reduction (MDR) and Classification and Regression tree (CART) analysis so as to find possible interaction between SNPs on XRCC1 gene.Statistical analysis revealed XRCC1 Gln632Gln (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.67, p\u00a0=\u00a0<\u00a00.001) depicted an overall high risk towards lung cancer. Histological subdivision revealed carriers of mutant genotype in case of XRCC1 Arg399Gln imposed a protective effect towards SQCC subtype. Likewise, mutant genotype in XRCC1 Pro206Pro implied a protective effect for SCLC subtype (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.29, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0017) on the contrary XRCC1 Gln632Gln showed a high risk in SQCC diseased group (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.16, p\u00a0=\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).Combination of XRCC1 Gln632Gln with other SNPs revealed XRCC1 Gln632Gln with Arg194Trp (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.10, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and Pro206Pro (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0004) increased an overall risk towards lung cancer.

Our previous studies revealed that two Arabidopsis PCNA genes were able to complement the essential function of POL30 in budding yeast, but failed to rescue the PRR activity. Here we hypothesize that a certain amino acid variation(s) is responsible for the difference, and identified K196 as a critical residue for the PRR activity. It was found that the pol30-K196V mutation abolishes Rad18 interaction and PRR activity, whereas nearby amino acid substitutions can partially restore Rad18 interaction and PRR activity. Together with the Pol30-Ub fusion data, we believe that we have identified a putative Rad18-binding pocket in Pol30 that is required for PCNA monoubiquitination and PRR.",

LasR is a master regulator which controls the virulence of P. aeruginosa in response to bacterial cell-density and host signals. During infection, lasR is frequently mutated, conferring P. aeruginosa a growth advantage in hosts and enhances resistance to widely used antibiotics. However, the mechanistic basis of lasR mutation is not well understood. We have tested here the hypothesis that transcription strength is a contributory determinant of lasR mutagenesis. P. aeruginosa strains with different lasR transcription strengths were therefore engineered and the lasR mutations were monitored unbiasedly using next-generation sequencing technology. Our results suggest that the strength of transcription could be one of the deterministic factors that drive the mutagenesis of lasR in P. aeruginosa, shedding new insights into bacterial infection and antibiotic resistance.",

     "abstract": "3-Nitrobenzanthrone (3-NBA), a byproduct of diesel exhaust, is highly present in the environment and poses a significant health risk. Exposure to 3-NBA results in formation of N-(2\u2032-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone (dGC8-N-ABA), a bulky DNA lesion that is of particular importance due to its mutagenic and carcinogenic potential. If not repaired or bypassed during genomic replication, dGC8-N-ABA can stall replication forks, leading to senescence and cell death. Here we used pre-steady-state kinetic methods to determine which of the four human Y-family DNA polymerases (hPol\u03b7, hPol\u03ba, hPol\u03b9, or hRev1) are able to catalyze translesion synthesis of dGC8-N-ABAin vitro. Our studies demonstrated that hPol\u03b7 and hPol\u03ba most efficiently bypassed a site-specifically placed dGC8-N-ABA lesion, making them good candidates for catalyzing translesion synthesis (TLS) of this bulky lesion in vivo. Consistently, our publication (Biochemistry 53, 5323-31) in 2014 has shown that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of hPol\u03b7 and hPol\u03ba in HEK293T cells significantly reduces the efficiency of TLS of dGC8-N-ABA. In contrast, hPol\u03b9 and hRev1 were severely stalled by dGC8-N-ABA and their potential role in vivo was discussed. Subsequently, we determined the kinetic parameters for correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by hPol\u03b7 at various positions upstream, opposite, and downstream from dGC8-N-ABA. Notably, nucleotide incorporation efficiency and fidelity both decreased significantly during dGC8-N-ABA bypass and the subsequent extension step, leading to polymerase pausing and error-prone DNA synthesis by hPol\u03b7. Furthermore, hPol\u03b7 displayed nucleotide concentration-dependent biphasic kinetics at the two polymerase pause sites, suggesting that multiple enzyme\u2022DNA complexes likely exist during nucleotide incorporation.",

The simultaneous mutation of both Asp (ATA) phenocopies the Rev3l knockout, which proves that the catalytic activity is mandatory for the vital functions of Rev3L, as reported recently. Surprisingly, although the mutation of the first Asp severely impairs the enzymatic activity of other B-family DNA polymerases, the corresponding mutation of Rev3 (ATD) is hypomorphic in yeast and mouse, as it does not affect viability and proliferation and moderately impacts UVC-induced cell death and mutagenesis. Interestingly, Rev3l hypomorphic mutant mice display a distinct, albeit modest, alteration of the immunoglobulin gene mutation spectrum at G-C base pairs, further documenting its role in this process.",

However, the lack of a simple to use, sensitive and standardised assay to test for synthetic interactions has been slowing the efforts. Here we present a novel approach to synthetic lethality screening based on co-culturing two syngeneic cell lines containing individual fluorescent tags. By associating shRNAs for a target gene or control to individual fluorescence labels, we can easily follow individual cell fates upon siRNA treatment and high content imaging. We have demonstrated that the system can recapitulate the functional defects of the target gene depletion and is capable of discovering novel synthetic interactors and phenotypes. In a trial screen, we show that TIP60 exhibits synthetic lethality interaction with BAF180, and that in the absence of TIP60, there is an increase micronuclei dependent on the level of BAF180 loss, significantly above levels seen with BAF180 present. Moreover, the severity of the interactions correlates with proxy measurements of BAF180 knockdown efficacy, which may expand its usefulness to addressing synthetic interactions through titratable hypomorphic gene expression.",

     "abstract": "Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) operates when replicative polymerases are blocked by DNA lesions. To investigate the mechanism of mammalian TLS, we employed a plasmid bearing a single 7-(deoxyadenosine-N6-yl)-aristolactam I (dA-AL-I) adduct, which is generated by the human carcinogen, aristolochic acid I, and genetically engineered mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This lesion induces A to T transversions at a high frequency. The simultaneous knockouts of the Polh, Poli and Polk genes did not influence the TLS efficiency or the coding property of dA-AL-I, indicating that an unknown DNA polymerase(s) can efficiently catalyze the insertion of a nucleotide opposite the adduct and subsequent extension. Similarly, knockout of the Rev1 gene did not significantly affect TLS. However, knockout of the Rev3l gene, coding for the catalytic subunit of pol\u03b6, drastically suppressed TLS and abolished dA-AL-I to T transversions. The results support the idea that Rev1 is not essential for the cellular TLS functions of pol\u03b6 in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the frequency of dA-AL-I to T transversion was affected by a sequence context, suggesting that TLS, at least in part, contributes to the formation of mutational hot and cold spots observed in aristolochic acid-induced cancers.",

     "abstract": "For 30 years two general mechanisms have competed to explain somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes. The first, the DNA-based model, is focused only on DNA substrates. The modern form is the Neuberger \u201cDNA Deamination Model\u201d based on activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and short-patch error-prone DNA repair by DNA Polymerase-\u03b7 operating around AID C-to-U lesions. The other is an RNA-based mechanism or the \u201cReverse Transcriptase Model\u201d of SHM which produces strand-biased mutations at A:T and G:C base pairs. This involves error-prone cDNA synthesis via an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase copying the Ig pre-mRNA template and integrating the now error-filled cDNA copy back into the normal chromosomal site. The modern form of this mechanism depends on AID dC-to-dU lesions and long tract error-prone cDNA synthesis of the transcribed strand by DNA Polymerase-\u03b7 acting as a reverse transcriptase. The evidence for and against each mechanism is critically evaluated. The conclusion is that all the SHM molecular data gathered since 1980 supports directly or indirectly the RNA/RT-based mechanism. All the data and critical analyses are systematically laid out so the reader can evaluate this conclusion for themselves.Recently we have investigated whether similar RNA/RT-based mutator mechanisms explain how de novo mutations arise in somatic tissues (cancer genomes). The data analyses indeed suggest that cancers arise via dysregulated \u201cIg-like SHM responses\u201d involving rogue DNA and RNA deaminations coupled to genome-wide RT events. Further, Robyn Lindley has recently shown that the strand-biased mutations in cancer genome genes are also in \u201ccodon-context.\u201d This has been termed Targeted Somatic Mutation (TSM) to highlight that mutations are far more targeted than previously thought in somatic tissues associated with disease. The TSM process implies an \u201cin-frame DNA reader\u201d whereby DNA and RNA deaminases at transcribed regions are guided in their mutagenic action, by the codon reading frame of the DNA.",

     "abstract": "The presence or emergence of chemoresistance in tumor cells is a major burden in cancer therapy. While drug resistance is a multifactorial phenomenon arising from altered membrane transport of drugs, altered drug metabolism, altered DNA repair, reduced apoptosis rate and alterations of drug metabolism, it can also be linked to genetic and epigenetic factors. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have important regulatory roles in many aspects of genome function including gene transcription, splicing, and epigenetics as well as biological processes involved in cell cycle, cell differentiation, development, and pluripotency. As such, it may not be surprising that some lncRNAs have been recently linked to carcinogenesis and drug resistance/sensitivity. Research is accelerating to decipher the exact molecular mechanism of lncRNA-regulated drug resistance and its therapeutic implications. In this article, we will review the structure, biogenesis, and mode of action of lncRNAs. Then, the involvement of lncRNAs in drug resistance will be discussed in detail.",

The defects or mutations of TLS pols are predicted to result in hypersensitivity of cells to environmental mutagens. In this study, human cells expressing DNA polymerase \u03b6 (Pol \u03b6) variants with low fidelity or weak catalytic activity have been established with Nalm-6-MSH+ cells and their sensitivity to mutagenicity and cytotoxicity of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE) and ultraviolet-C light (UV-C) was examined. The low-fidelity mutants were engineered by knocking-in DNA sequences that direct changes of leucine 2618 to either phenylalanine (L2618F) or methionine (L2618M) of Pol \u03b6. The weak-catalytic-activity mutants were generated by knocking-in DNA sequences that direct changes of either tyrosine 2779 to phenylalanine (Y2779F) or aspartate 2781 to asparagine (D2781N). In addition, a +1 frameshift mutation, i.e., CCC to CCCC, was introduced in the coding region of the TK1 gene to measure the mutant frequencies. Doubling time and spontaneous TK mutant frequencies of the established cell lines were similar to those of the wild-type cells. The low-fidelity mutants displayed, however, higher sensitivity to the mutagenicity of BPDE and UV-C than the wild-type cells although their cytotoxic sensitivity was not changed. In contrast, the weak-catalytic-activity mutants were more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of BPDE and UV-C than the wild-type cells, and displayed much higher sensitivity to the clastogenicity of BPDE than the wild-type cells in an in vitro micronucleus assay. These results indicate that human Pol \u03b6 is involved in TLS across DNA lesions induced by BPDE and UV-C and also that the TLS plays important roles in induction of mutations, clastogenicity and in cellular survival of the damaged human cells. Similarities and differences in in vivo roles of yeast and human Pol \u03b6 in genome integrity are discussed.",

An increased level of Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) was noted after treatment with ABT-888 in QC pre-treated mBCSCs cells. Increased APC physically interacts with PARP-1 and inhibits PARylation causing the non assembly of base excision repair (BER) multiprotein complex, resulting in an irreparable DNA damage and subsequent apoptosis. Knockdown of APC in mBCSCs inhibited DNA damage, increased BER and PARylation, reduces apoptosis while the over-expression of APC in BT20 (APC low expressing) cells reversed the effect. Thus, combination of QC and ABT-888 decreased mBCSCs growth by activating APC and inhibiting BER within the cells.",

     "abstract": "In mammalian cells, chromatin poly(ADP-ribos)ylation (PARylation) at sites of DNA Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs) is mediated by two highly related enzymes, PARP1 and PARP2. However, enzyme-specific genetic interactions with other DSB repair factors remain largely undefined. In this context, it was previously shown that mice lacking PARP1 and H2AX, a histone variant that promotes DSB repair throughout the cell cycle, or the core nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) factor Ku80 are not viable, while mice lacking PARP1 and the noncore NHEJ factor DNA-PKcs are severely growth retarded and markedly lymphoma-prone. Here, we have examined the requirement for PARP2 in these backgrounds. We find that, like PARP1, PARP2 is essential for viability in mice lacking H2AX. Moreover, treatment of H2AX-deficient primary fibroblasts or B lymphocytes with PARP inhibitors leads to activation of the G2/M checkpoint and accumulation of chromatid-type breaks in a lineage- and gene-dose dependent manner. In marked contrast to PARP1, loss of PARP2 does not result in additional phenotypes in growth, development or tumorigenesis in mice lacking either Ku80 or DNA-PKcs. Altogether these findings highlight specific nonoverlapping functions of PARP1 and PARP2 at H2AX-deficient chromatin during replicative phases of the cell cycle and uncover a unique requirement for PARP1 in NHEJ-deficient cells.",

Organisms have developed several pathways and have many factors devoted to repairing DSBs, which broadly occurs by homologous recombination, which relies on an identical or homologous sequence to template repair, or nonhomologous end-joining. Much of our understanding of these repair mechanisms has come from the study of induced DNA cleavage by site-specific endonucleases. In addition to their biological role, these cellular pathways can be co-opted for gene editing to study gene function or for gene therapy or other applications. While the first gene editing experiments were done more than 20 years ago, the recent discovery of RNA-guided endonucleases has simplified approaches developed over the years to make gene editing an approach that is available to the entire biomedical research community.

     "abstract": "Cells are continuously exposed to both endogenous and exogenous sources of genomic stress. To maintain chromosome stability, a variety of mechanisms have evolved to cope with the multitude of genetic abnormalities that can arise over the life of a cell. Still, failures to repair these lesions are the driving force of cancers and other degenerative disorders. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most toxic genetic lesions, inhibiting cell ability to replicate, and are sites of mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. DSB repair is known to proceed via two major mechanisms: homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR reliance on the exchange of genetic information between two identical or nearly identical DNA molecules offers increased accuracy. While the preferred substrate for HR in mitotic cells is the sister chromatid, this is limited to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. However, abundant amounts of homologous genetic substrate may exist throughout the cell cycle in the form of RNA. Considered an uncommon occurrence, the direct transfer of information from RNA to DNA is thought to be limited to special circumstances. Studies have shown that RNA molecules reverse transcribed into cDNA can be incorporated into DNA at DSB sites via a non-templated mechanism by NHEJ or a templated mechanism by HR. In addition, synthetic RNA molecules can directly template the repair of DSBs in yeast and human cells via an HR mechanism. New work suggests that even endogenous transcript RNA can serve as a homologous template to repair a DSB in chromosomal DNA. In this perspective, we will review and discuss the recent advancements in DSB repair by RNA via non-templated and templated mechanisms. We will provide current findings, models and future challenges investigating RNA and its role in DSB repair.",

The C-terminal third of the protein is a family A DNA polymerase with additional insertion elements relative to prokaryotic homologs. The N-terminal third is a helicase-like domain with DNA-dependent ATPase activity. Pol \u03b8 is important in the repair of genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) from many sources. These include breaks formed by ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors, breaks arising at stalled DNA replication forks, breaks introduced during diversification steps of the mammalian immune system, and DSB induced by CRISPR-Cas9. Pol \u03b8 participates in a route of DSB repair termed \u201calternative end-joining\u201d (altEJ). AltEJ is independent of the DNA binding Ku protein complex and requires DNA end resection. Pol \u03b8 is able to mediate joining of two resected 3\u2032 ends harboring DNA sequence microhomology. \u201cSignatures\u201d of Pol \u03b8 action during altEJ are the frequent utilization of longer microhomologies, and the insertion of additional sequences at joining sites. The mechanism of end-joining employs the ability of Pol \u03b8 to tightly grasp a 3\u2032 terminus through unique contacts in the active site, allowing extension from minimally paired primers. Pol \u03b8 is involved in controlling the frequency of chromosome translocations and preserves genome integrity by limiting large deletions. It may also play a backup role in DNA base excision repair. POLQ is a member of a cluster of similarly upregulated genes that are strongly correlated with poor clinical outcome for breast cancer, ovarian cancer and other cancer types. Inhibition of pol \u03b8 is a compelling approach for combination therapy of radiosensitization.",

Early models of mutagenesis envisioned the Umu proteins as accessory factors to the cell\u2019s replicase that not only reduced its normally high fidelity, but also allowed the enzyme to traverse otherwise replication-blocking lesions in the genome. However, these models underwent a radical revision approximately 15 years ago, with the discovery that the Umu proteins actually encode for a DNA polymerase, E.coli pol V. The polymerase lacks 3\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a05\u2032 exonucleolytic proofreading activity and is inherently error-prone when replicating both undamaged and damage DNA. So as to limit any \u201cgratuitous\u201d mutagenesis, the activity of pol V is strictly regulated in the cell at multiple levels. This review will summarize our current understanding of the myriad levels of regulation imposed on pol V including transcriptional control, posttranslational modification, targeted proteolysis, activation of the catalytic activity of pol V through protein\u2013protein interactions and the very recently described intracellular spatial regulation of pol V.

     "abstract": "Lesion tolerance pathways allow cells to proceed with replication despite the presence of replication-blocking lesions in their genome. Following transient fork stalling, replication resumes downstream leaving daughter strand gaps opposite replication-blocking lesions. The existence and repair of these gaps have been know for decades and are commonly referred to as postreplicative repair [39], [38] (Rupp, 2013; Rupp and Howard-Flanders, 1968). This paper analyzes the interaction of the pathways involved in the repair of these gaps. A key repair intermediated is formed when RecA protein binds to these gaps forming ssDNA.RecA filaments establishing the so-called SOS signal. The gaps are either \u201crepaired\u201d by Translesion Synthesis (TLS), a process that involves the transient recruitment of a specialized DNA polymerase that copies the lesion with an intrinsic risk of fixing a mutation opposite the lesion site, or by Damage Avoidance, an error-free pathway that involves homologous recombination with the sister chromatid (Homology Directed Gap Repair: HDGR). We have developed an assay that allows one to study the partition between TLS and HDGR in the context of a single replication-blocking lesion present in the E. coli chromosome. The level of expression of the TLS polymerases controls the extent of TLS. Our data show that TLS is implemented first with great parsimony, followed by abundant recombination-based tolerance events. Indeed, the substrate for TLS, i.e., the ssDNA.RecA filament, persists for only a limited amount of time before it engages in an early recombination intermediates (D-loop) with the sister chromatid. Time-based competition between TLS and HDGR is set by mere sequestration of the TLS substrates into early recombination intermediates. Most gaps are subsequently repaired by Homology Directed Gap Repair (HDGR), a pathway that involves RecA. Surprisingly, however, in the absence of RecA, some cells manage to divide and form colonies at the expense of losing the damage-containing chromatid.",

     "abstract": "The multitude of DNA lesions that continuously form in DNA cannot all be detected and removed prior to replication. Thus, encounters of the replication fork with DNA damage become inevitable. Such encounters inhibit fork progression, leading to replication fork arrest or to replication re-priming downstream of the damage site. Either of these events will result in the formation of gap-lesion structures, in which a damaged base is located in a single stranded stretch of DNA, that is vulnerable to subsequent nicking. The double strand break that would ensue if ssDNA becomes nicked constitutes escalation of the damage from nucleotide(s)-specific to chromosomal scale. Cells employ two universal DNA damage tolerance (DDT) strategies to resolve these situations, by converting the gap-lesion structures into dsDNA without repairing the damage. The first is translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), in which a specialized low-fidelity DNA polymerase inserts a nucleotide opposite the damaged one. TLS is inherently mutagenic, due to the miscoding nature of most damaged nucleotides. The second strategy is homology-dependent repair (HDR), which relies on the presence of an identical intact sister chromatid. The molecular mechanisms that regulate the division of labor between these pathways are poorly understood. This review focuses on the balance between TLS and HDR in mammalian cells, discussing recent findings that were made possible thanks to newly developed high resolution genomic assays, and highlighting the role of the DNA lesion\u2019s properties in DDT pathway choice.",

     "abstract": "The AlkB gene that protects E.coli against methylation damage to DNA was identified more than 3 decades ago. 20 years later, the AlkB protein was shown to catalyze repair of methylated DNA base lesions by oxidative demethylation. Two human AlkB homologs were characterized with similar DNA repair activities and seven additional human AlkB homologs were identified based on sequence homology. All these dioxygenases, ALKBH1-8 and FTO, contain a conserved \u03b1-ketoglutarate/iron-dependent domain for methyl modifications and de-modifications. Well-designed research over the last 10 years has identified unforeseen substrate heterogeneity for the AlkB homologs, including novel reversible methyl modifications in RNA. The discoveries of RNA demethylation catalyzed by AlkB family enzymes initiated a new realm of gene expression regulation, although the understanding of precise endogenous activities and roles of these RNA demethylases are still undeveloped. It is worth mentioning that the AlkB mechanism and use of \u03b1-ketoglutarate have also emerged to be essential for many enzymes in epigenetic reprogramming that modify and de-modify methylated bases in DNA and methylated amino acids in histones.",

     "abstract": "Pathways that control and modulate DNA methylation patterning in mammalian cells were poorly understood for a long time, although their importance in establishing and maintaining cell type-specific gene expression was well recognized. The discovery of proteins capable of converting 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to putative substrates for DNA repair introduced a novel and exciting conceptual framework for the investigation and ultimate discovery of molecular mechanisms of DNA demethylation. Against the prevailing notion that DNA methylation is a static epigenetic mark, it turned out to be dynamic and distinct mechanisms appear to have evolved to effect global and locus-specific DNA demethylation. There is compelling evidence that DNA repair, in particular base excision repair, contributes significantly to the turnover of 5mC in cells. By actively demethylating DNA, DNA repair supports the developmental establishment as well as the maintenance of DNA methylation landscapes and gene expression patterns. Yet, while the biochemical pathways are relatively well-established and reviewed, the biological context, function and regulation of DNA repair-mediated active DNA demethylation remains uncertain. In this review, we will thus summarize and critically discuss the evidence that associates active DNA demethylation by DNA repair with specific functional contexts including the DNA methylation erasure in the early embryo, the control of pluripotency and cellular differentiation, the maintenance of cell identity, and the nuclear reprogramming.",

     "abstract": "Free radicals generate an array of DNA lesions affecting all parts of the molecule. The damage to deoxyribose receives less attention than base damage, even though the former accounts for \u223c20% of the total. Oxidative deoxyribose fragments (e.g., 3\u2032-phosphoglycolate esters) are removed by the Ape1 AP endonuclease and other enzymes in mammalian cells to enable DNA repair synthesis. Oxidized abasic sites are initially incised by Ape1, thus recruiting these lesions into base excision repair (BER) pathways. Lesions such as 2-deoxypentos-4-ulose can be removed by conventional (single-nucleotide) BER, which proceeds through a covalent Schiff base intermediate with DNA polymerase \u03b2 (Pol\u03b2) that is resolved by hydrolysis. In contrast, the lesion 2-deoxyribonolactone (dL) must be processed by multinucleotide (\u201clong-patch\u201d) BER: attempted repair via the single-nucleotide pathway leads to a dead-end, covalent complex with Pol\u03b2 cross- linked to the DNA by an amide bond. We recently detected these stable DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) between Pol\u03b2 and dL in intact cells. The features of the DPC formation in vivo are exactly in keeping with the mechanistic properties seen in vitro: Pol\u03b2-DPC are formed by oxidative agents in line with their ability to form the dL lesion; they are not formed by non-oxidative agents; DPC formation absolutely requires the active-site lysine-72 that attacks the 5\u2032-deoxyribose; and DPC formation depends on Ape1 to incise the dL lesion first. The Pol\u03b2-DPC are rapidly processed in vivo, the signal disappearing with a half-life of 15\u201330\u00a0min in both mouse and human cells. This removal is blocked by inhibiting the proteasome, which leads to the accumulation of ubiquitin associated with the Pol\u03b2-DPC. While other proteins (e.g., topoisomerases) also form DPC under these conditions, 60\u201370% of the trapped ubiquitin depends on Pol\u03b2. The mechanism of ubiquitin targeting to Pol\u03b2-DPC, the subsequent processing of the expected 5\u2032-peptidyl-dL, and the biological consequences of unrepaired DPC are important to assess. Many other lyase enzymes that attack dL can also be trapped in DPC, so the processing mechanisms may apply quite broadly.",

     "abstract": "For faithful DNA repair, it is crucial for cells to locate lesions precisely within the vast genome. In the mammalian global genomic nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, this difficult task is accomplished through multiple steps, in which the xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein complex plays a central role. XPC senses the presence of oscillating 'normal' bases in the DNA duplex, and its binding properties contribute to the extremely broad substrate specificity of NER. Unlike XPC, which acts as a versatile sensor of DNA helical distortion, the UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) is more specialized, recognizing UV-induced photolesions and facilitating recruitment of XPC. Recent single-molecule analyses and structural studies have advanced our understanding of how UV-DDB finds its targets, particularly in the context of chromatin. After XPC binds DNA, it is necessary to verify the presence of damage in order to avoid potentially deleterious incisions at damage-free sites. Accumulating evidence suggests that XPA and the helicase activity of transcription factor IIH (TFIIH) cooperate to verify abnormalities in DNA chemistry. This chapter reviews recent findings about the mechanisms underlying the efficiency, versatility, and accuracy of NER.",

Less well known is that semi-conservative replication of telomeric DNA also presents problems for DNA replication. These problems likely arise from the atypical chromatin structure of telomeres, the GC-richness of telomeric DNA that makes it prone to forming DNA secondary structures, and from RNA-DNA hybrids, formed by transcripts of one or both DNA strands. Given the different aspects of telomeres that complicate their replication, it is not surprising that multiple DNA helicases promote replication of telomeric DNA. This review focuses on one such class of DNA helicases, the Pif1 family of 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 DNA helicases.

In pigmented melanocytes, we found that CPDs arise both instantaneously and for hours after UV exposure ends. Remarkably, the CPDs arising in the dark originate by a novel pathway that resembles bioluminescence but does not end in light: First, UV activates the enzymes nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and NADPH oxidase (NOX), which generate the radicals nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide (O2\u2212); these combine to form the powerful oxidant peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212). A fragment of the skin pigment melanin is then oxidized, exciting an electron to an energy level so high that it is rarely seen in biology. This process of chemically exciting electrons, termed \u201cchemiexcitation\u201d, is used by fireflies to generate light but it had never been seen in mammalian cells. In melanocytes, the energy transfers radiationlessly to DNA, inducing CPDs. Chemiexcitation is a new source of genome instability, and it calls attention to endogenous mechanisms of genome maintenance that prevent electronic excitation or dissipate the energy of excited states. Chemiexcitation may also trigger pathogenesis in internal tissues because the same chemistry should arise wherever superoxide and nitric oxide arise near cells that contain melanin.",

UVA is about 20-times more abundant than UVB in incident sunlight. It does cause some DNA damage but this does not fully account for its biological impact.

The first bottleneck in cell recovery from radiation damage is functional (proteome) rather than informational (DNA), since prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell death correlates with incurred protein, but not DNA, damage. Proteome protection against oxidative damage determines survival after ionizing or UV irradiation, since sufficient residual proteome activity is required to turn on the DNA damage response activating DNA repair and protein renewal processes.Extreme radiation and desiccation resistance of rare bacterial and animal species is accounted for by exceptional constitutive proteome protection against oxidative damage. After excessive radiation their well-protected proteome faithfully reconstitutes a transcription-competent genome from hundreds of DNA fragments. The observation that oxidative damage targeted selectively to cellular proteins results in aging-like phenotypes suggests that aging and age-related diseases could be phenotypic consequences of proteome damage patterns progressing with age.",

     "abstract": "Artificially modified nucleotides, in the form of nucleoside analogues, are widely used in the treatment of cancers and various other diseases, and have become important tools in the laboratory to characterise DNA repair pathways. In contrast, the role of endogenously occurring nucleotide modifications in genome stability is little understood. This is despite the demonstration over three decades ago that the cellular DNA precursor pool is orders of magnitude more susceptible to modification than the DNA molecule itself. More recently, underscoring the importance of this topic, oxidation of the cellular nucleotide pool achieved through targeting the sanitation enzyme MTH1, appears to be a promising anti-cancer strategy. This article reviews our current understanding of modified DNA precursors in genome stability, with a particular focus upon oxidised nucleotides, and outlines some important outstanding questions.",

Such signatures provide information regarding mechanisms of tumor induction which, in turn, can reduce exposure to carcinogens by shaping public health policy. Using a molecular epidemiologic approach that takes advantage of recent advances in genome sequencing while applying sensitive and specific analytical methods to characterize DNA damage, it has become increasingly possible to establish causative linkages between certain environmental mutagens and disease risk. In this perspective, we use aristolochic acid, a human carcinogen and nephrotoxin found in Aristolochia herbs, to illustrate the power and effectiveness of this multidisciplinary approach. The genome-wide mutational signature for this toxin, detected initially in cancers of the upper urinary tract, has subsequently been associated with cancers of the liver and kidney. These findings have significant implications for global public health, especially in China, where millions of individuals have used Aristolochia herbal remedies as part of traditional Chinese medicine and, thus, are at risk of developing aristolochic acid nephropathy and/or upper urinary tract carcinomas. The studies reported here set the stage for research into prevention and early detection, both of which will be required to manage a potentially devastating global disease.",

A wide range of nucleases, including Artemis, Metnase, APLF, Mre11, CtIP, APE1, APE2 and WRN, are biochemically competent to carry out such double-strand break end processing, and have been implicated in NHEJ by at least circumstantial evidence.

     "abstract": "Mammalian chromosome ends are protected by nucleoprotein structures called telomeres. Telomeres ensure genome stability by preventing chromosome termini from being recognized as DNA damage. Telomere length homeostasis is inevitable for telomere maintenance because critical shortening or over-lengthening of telomeres may lead to DNA damage response or delay in DNA replication, and hence genome instability. Due to their repetitive DNA sequence, unique architecture, bound shelterin proteins, and high propensity to form alternate/secondary DNA structures, telomeres are like common fragile sites and pose an inherent challenge to the progression of DNA replication, repair, and recombination apparatus. It is conceivable that longer the telomeres are, greater is the severity of such challenges. Recent studies have linked excessively long telomeres with increased tumorigenesis. Here we discuss telomere abnormalities in a rare recessive chromosomal instability disorder called Fanconi Anemia and the role of the Fanconi Anemia pathway in telomere biology. Reports suggest that Fanconi Anemia proteins play a role in maintaining long telomeres, including processing telomeric joint molecule intermediates. We speculate that ablation of the Fanconi Anemia pathway would lead to inadequate aberrant structural barrier resolution at excessively long telomeres, thereby causing replicative burden on the cell.",

     "abstract": "Trinucleotide repeats (TNRs) are tandem arrays of three nucleotides that can expand in length to cause at least 17 inherited human diseases. Somatic expansions in patients can occur in differentiated tissues where DNA replication is limited and cannot be a primary source of somatic mutation. Instead, mouse models of TNR diseases have shown that both inherited and somatic expansions can be suppressed by the loss of certain DNA repair factors. It is generally believed that these repair factors cause misprocessing of TNRs, leading to expansions. Here we extend this idea to show that the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 (MRX) complex of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a causative factor in expansions of short TNRs. Mutations that eliminate MRX subunits led to significant suppression of expansions whereas mutations that inactivate Rad51 had only a minor effect. Coupled with previous evidence, this suggests that MRX drives expansions of short TNRs through a process distinct from homologous recombination. The nuclease function of Mre11 was dispensable for expansions, suggesting that expansions do not occur by Mre11-dependent nucleolytic processing of the TNR. Epistasis between MRX and post-replication repair (PRR) was tested. PRR protects against expansions, so a rad5 mutant gave a high expansion rate. In contrast, the mre11 rad5 double mutant gave a suppressed expansion rate, indistinguishable from the mre11 single mutant. This suggests that MRX creates a TNR substrate for PRR. Protein acetylation was also tested as a mechanism regulating MRX activity in expansions. Six acetylation sites were identified in Rad50. Mutation of all six lysine residues to arginine gave partial bypass of a sin3 HDAC mutant, suggesting that Rad50 acetylation is functionally important for Sin3-mediated expansions. Overall we conclude that yeast MRX helps drive expansions of short TNRs by a mechanism distinct from its role in homologous recombination and independent of the nuclease function of Mre11.",

A series of DNA ligase inhibitors with differing selectivity for the three human DNA ligases were identified using a structure-based approach with one of these inhibitors being used to inhibit abnormal DNA ligase III\u03b1-dependent repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB)s in breast cancer, neuroblastoma and leukemia cell lines. Raghavan and colleagues reported the characterization of a derivative of one of the previously identified DNA ligase inhibitors, which they called SCR7 (designated SCR7-R in our experiments using SCR7). SCR7 appeared to show increased selectivity for DNA ligase IV, inhibit the repair of DSBs by the DNA ligase IV-dependent non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway, reduce tumor growth, and increase the efficacy of DSB-inducing therapeutic modalities in mouse xenografts. In attempting to synthesize SCR7, we encountered problems with the synthesis procedures and discovered discrepancies in its reported structure. We determined the structure of a sample of SCR7 and a related compound, SCR7-G, that is the major product generated by the published synthesis procedure for SCR7. We also found that SCR7-G has the same structure as the compound (SCR7-X) available from a commercial vendor (XcessBio). The various SCR7 preparations had similar activity in DNA ligation assay assays, exhibiting greater activity against DNA ligases I and III than DNA ligase IV. Furthermore, SCR7-R failed to inhibit DNA ligase IV-dependent V(D)J recombination in a cell-based assay. Based on our results, we conclude that SCR7 and the SCR7 derivatives are neither selective nor potent inhibitors of DNA ligase IV.",

DNA pol reactions require at least two divalent metal ions for the phosphodiester bond formation. We explore two understudied roles of metals in pol transactions with emphasis on pol\u03b1, a crucial enzyme in the initiation of DNA synthesis. We present evidence that the combination of many factors, including the structure of the template/primer, the identity of the metal, the metal turnover in the pol active site, and the influence of the concentration of nucleoside triphosphates, affect DNA pol synthesis. On the poly-dT70 template, the increase of Mg2+ concentration within the range typically used for pol reactions led to the severe loss of the ability of pol to extend DNA primers and led to a decline in DNA product sizes when extending RNA primers, simulating the effect of \u201ccounting\u201d of the number of nucleotides in nascent primers by pol\u03b1. We suggest that a high Mg2+ concentration promotes the dynamic formation of unconventional DNA structure(s), thus limiting the apparent processivity of the enzyme. Next, we found that Zn2+ supported robust pol\u03b1 reactions when the concentration of nucleotides was above the concentration of ions; however, there was only one nucleotide incorporation by the Klenow fragment of DNA pol I. Zn2+ drastically inhibited pol\u03b1, but had no effect on Klenow, when Mg2+ was also present. It is possible that Zn2+ perturbs metal-mediated transactions in pol active site, for example affecting the step of pyrophosphate removal at the end of each pol cycle necessary for continuation of polymerization.",

Proteolytic degradation of the covalently attached Top2 leaves a 5\u2032-tyrosylated blocked termini which is removed by tyrosyl DNA phosphodiesterase 2 (TDP2), prior to DSB repair through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Thus, TDP2 confers resistance of tumor cells to Top2-poisons by repairing such covalent DNA-protein adducts, and its pharmacological inhibition could enhance the efficacy of Top2-poisons.

Here we identified the chromatin remodeling factor SNF2H/SMARCA5 as a novel binding partner of XRCC1, with their interaction dependent on the casein kinase 2-mediated constitutive phosphorylation of XRCC1. The proficiency of repairing H2O2-induced damage was strongly impaired by SNF2H knock-down, and similar impairment was observed with knock-down of both XRCC1 and SNF2H simultaneously, suggesting their role in a common repair pathway. Most SNF2H exists in the nuclear matrix fraction, forming salt extraction-resistant foci-like structures in unchallenged nuclei. Remarkably, damage-induced formation of both PAR and XRCC1 foci depended on SNF2H, and the PAR and XRCC1 foci co-localized with the SNF2H foci.

     "abstract": "The family of Ten-Eleven Translocation (TET) proteins is implicated in the process of active DNA demethylation and thus in epigenetic regulation. TET 1, 2 and 3 proteins are oxygenases that can hydroxylate 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) and further oxidize 5-hmC into 5-formylcytosine (5-fC) and 5-carboxylcytosine (5-caC). The base excision repair (BER) pathway removes the resulting 5-fC and 5-caC bases paired with a guanine and replaces them with regular cytosine. The question arises whether active modification of 5-mC residues and their subsequent elimination could affect the genomic DNA stability. Here, we generated two inducible cell lines (Ba/F3-EPOR, and UT7) overexpressing wild-type or catalytically inactive human TET2 proteins. Wild-type TET2 induction resulted in an increased level of 5-hmC and a cell cycle defect in S phase associated with higher level of phosphorylated P53, chromosomal and centrosomal abnormalities. Furthermore, in a thymine-DNA glycosylase (Tdg) deficient context, the TET2-mediated increase of 5-hmC induces mutagenesis characterized by GC\u00a0>\u00a0AT transitions in CpG context suggesting a mutagenic potential of 5-hmC metabolites. Altogether, these data suggest that TET2 activity and the levels of 5-hmC and its derivatives should be tightly controlled to avoid genetic and chromosomal instabilities. Moreover, TET2-mediated active demethylation might be a very dangerous process if used to entirely demethylate the genome and might rather be used only at specific loci.",

     "abstract": "Dynamics of DNA methylation and demethylation at CpG clusters are involved in gene regulation. CpG clusters have been identified as hot spots of mutagenesis because of their susceptibility to oxidative DNA damage. Damaged Cs and Gs at CpGs can disrupt a normal DNA methylation pattern through modulation of DNA methylation and demethylation, leading to mutations and deregulation of gene expression. DNA base excision repair (BER) plays a dual role of repairing oxidative DNA damage and mediating an active DNA demethylation pathway on CpG clusters through removal of a T/G mismatch resulting from deamination of a 5mC adjacent to a guanine that can be simultaneously damaged by oxidative stress. However, it remains unknown how BER processes clustered lesions in CpGs and what are the consequences from the repair of these lesions. In this study, we examined BER of an abasic lesion next to a DNA demethylation intermediate, the T/G mismatch in a CpG dinucleotide, and its effect on the integrity of CpGs. Surprisingly, we found that the abasic lesion completely abolished the activity of thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) for removing the mismatched T. However, we found that APE1 could still efficiently incise the abasic lesion leaving a 3-terminus mismatched T, which was subsequently extended by pol \u03b2. This in turn resulted in a C to T transition mutation. Interestingly, we also found that APE1 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity efficiently removed the mismatched T, thereby preventing pol \u03b2 extension of the mismatched nucleotide and the resulting mutation. Our results demonstrate a crucial role of APE1 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease activity in combating mutations in CpG clusters caused by an intermediate of DNA demethylation during BER.",

     "abstract": "Non-Homologous End-Joining (NHEJ) is the predominant pathway for the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in human cells. The NHEJ pathway is frequently upregulated in several solid cancers as a compensatory mechanism for a separate DSB repair defect or for innate genomic instability, making this pathway a powerful target for synthetic lethality approaches. In addition, NHEJ reduces the efficacy of cancer treatment modalities which rely on the introduction of DSBs, like radiation therapy or genotoxic chemotherapy. Consequently, inhibition of the NHEJ pathway can modulate a radiation- or chemo-refractory disease presentation. The Ku70/80 heterodimer protein plays a pivotal role in the NHEJ process. It possesses a ring-shaped structure with high affinity for DSBs and serves as the first responder and central scaffold around which the rest of the repair complex is assembled. Because of this central position, the Ku70/80 dimer is a logical target for the disruption of the entire NHEJ pathway. Surprisingly, specific inhibitors of the Ku70/80 heterodimer are currently not available. We here describe an in silico, pocket-based drug discovery methodology utilizing the crystal structure of the Ku70/80 heterodimer. We identified a novel putative small molecule binding pocket and selected several potential inhibitors by computational screening. Subsequent biological screening resulted in the first identification of a compound with confirmed Ku-inhibitory activity in the low micro-molar range, capable of disrupting the binding of Ku70/80 to DNA substrates and impairing Ku-dependent activation of another NHEJ factor, the DNA-PKCS kinase. Importantly, this compound synergistically sensitized human cell lines to radiation treatment, indicating a clear potential to diminish DSB repair. The chemical scaffold we here describe can be utilized as a lead-generating platform for the design and development of a novel class of anti-cancer agents.",

In cancer tissues, overexpression of cyclin D1 is associated with both cancer genome instability, and resistance to DNA-damaging cancer drugs.

The inhibitory effect of P21 on cell cycle progression correlates with its nuclear localization. P21 can be induced by both p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms. Some other important functions attributed to p21 include transcriptional regulation, modulation or inhibition of apoptosis. These functions are largely dependent on direct p21/protein interactions and also on p21 subcellular localizations. In addition, p21 can play a role in DNA repair by interacting with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA).

     "abstract": "Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion beyond a certain threshold results in some 20 incurable neurodegenerative disorders where disease anticipation positively correlates with repeat length. Long TNRs typically display a bias toward further expansion during germinal transmission from parents to offspring, and then are highly unstable in somatic tissues of affected individuals. Understanding mechanisms of TNR instability will provide insights into disease pathogenesis. Previously, we showed that enhanced convergent transcription at long CAG repeat tracks induces TNR instability and cell death via ATR activation. Components of TC-NER (transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair) and RNaseH enzymes that resolve RNA/DNA hybrids oppose cell death, whereas the MSH2 component of MMR (mismatch repair) enhances cell death. The exact role of the MMR pathway during convergent transcription-induced cell death at CAG repeats is not well understood. In this study, we show that siRNA knockdowns of MMR components\u2014MSH2, MSH3, MLHI, PMS2, and PCNA\u2014reduce DNA toxicity. Furthermore, knockdown of MSH2, MLH1, and PMS2 significantly reduces the frequency of ATR foci formation.

Homologous recombination preferentially reunites cognate broken ends. In contrast, non-homologous end-joining could ligate together any two ends, possibly generating dicentric or acentric fragments, leading to inviability. Here, we characterize the yeast NHEJ pathway in populations of pure G1 phase cells, where there is no possibility of repair using a homolog. We show that in G1 yeast cells, NHEJ is a highly effective repair pathway for gamma-ray induced breaks, even when many breaks are present. Pulsed-field gel analysis showed chromosome karyotypes following NHEJ repair of cells from populations with multiple breaks. The number of reciprocal translocations was surprisingly low, perhaps zero, suggesting that NHEJ preferentially re-ligates the \u201ccorrect\u201d broken ends instead of randomly-chosen ends.

Activation of RAD51 recombination activities requires the assembly of RAD51 presynaptic filaments on the single-stranded DNA that forms at resected DSB ends. Mutations in proteins that control presynaptic filament assembly, such as BRCA2, and in RAD51 itself, are associated with human breast cancer. Here we describe the properties of two mutations in RAD51 protein that derive from human lung and kidney tumors, respectively. Sequence variants Q268P and Q272L both map to the DNA binding loop 2 (L2) region of RAD51, a motif that is involved in DNA binding and in the allosteric activation of ATP hydrolysis and DNA strand exchange activities. Both mutations alter the thermal stability, DNA binding, and ATPase properties of RAD51, however both variants retain intrinsic DNA strand exchange activity towards oligonucleotide substrates under optimized conditions. In contrast, both Q268P and Q272L variants exhibit drastically reduced DNA strand exchange activity in reaction mixtures containing long homologous ssDNA and dsDNA substrates and human RPA protein. Mixtures of wild-type and variant proteins also exhibit reduced DNA strand exchange activity, suggesting that heterozygous mutations could negatively affect DNA recombination and repair processes in vivo. Together, the findings of this study suggest that hypomorphic missense mutations in RAD51 protein could be drivers of genomic instability in cancer cells, and thereby contribute to the etiology of metastatic disease.",

RAD51D, the fourth member of the family, is a known ovarian cancer susceptibility gene and required for the repair of interstrand crosslink DNA damage and preserving chromosomal stability. In this report, we describe the RNF138 E3 ubiquitin ligase that interacts with and ubiquitinates the RAD51D HR protein. RNF138 is a member of an E3 ligase family that contains an amino-terminal RING finger domain and a putative carboxyl-terminal ubiquitin interaction motif. In mammalian cells, depletion of RNF138 increased the stability of the RAD51D protein, suggesting that RNF138 governs ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation of RAD51D. However, RNF138 depletion conferred sensitivity to DNA damaging agents, reduced RAD51 focus formation, and increased chromosomal instability. Site-specific mutagenesis of the RNF138 RING finger domain demonstrated that it was necessary for RAD51D ubiquitination. Presence of RNF138 also enhanced the interaction between RAD51D and a known interacting RAD51 family member XRCC2 in a yeast three-hybrid assay.

     "abstract": "Trinucleotide repeat expansions are responsible for at least two dozen neurological disorders. Mechanisms leading to these large expansions of repeated DNA are still poorly understood. It was proposed that transient stalling of the replication fork by the repeat tract might trigger slippage of the newly-synthesized strand over its template, leading to expansions or contractions of the triplet repeat. However, such mechanism was never formally proven. Here we show that replication fork pausing and CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat instability are not linked, stable and unstable repeats exhibiting the same propensity to stall replication forks when integrated in a yeast natural chromosome. We found that replication fork stalling was dependent on the integrity of the mismatch-repair system, especially the Msh2p-Msh6p complex, suggesting that direct interaction of MMR proteins with secondary structures formed by trinucleotide repeats in vivo, triggers replication fork pauses. We also show by chromatin immunoprecipitation that Msh2p is enriched at trinucleotide repeat tracts, in both stable and unstable orientations, this enrichment being dependent on MSH3 and MSH6. Finally, we show that overexpressing MSH2 favors the formation of heteroduplex regions, leading to an increase in contractions and expansions of CAG/CTG repeat tracts during replication, these heteroduplexes being dependent on both MSH3 and MSH6. These heteroduplex regions were not detected when a mutant msh2-E768A gene in which the ATPase domain was mutated was overexpressed. Our results unravel two new roles for mismatch-repair proteins: stabilization of heteroduplex regions and transient blocking of replication forks passing through such repeats. Both roles may involve direct interactions between MMR proteins and secondary structures formed by trinucleotide repeat tracts, although indirect interactions may not be formally excluded.",

     "abstract": "Typically disease-causing CAG/CTG repeats expand, but rare affected families can display high levels of contraction of the expanded repeat amongst offspring. Understanding instability is important since arresting expansions or enhancing contractions could be clinically beneficial. The MutS\u03b2 mismatch repair complex is required for CAG/CTG expansions in mice and patients. Oddly, by unknown mechanisms MutS\u03b2-deficient mice incur contractions instead of expansions. Replication using CTG or CAG as the lagging strand template is known to cause contractions or expansions respectively; however, the interplay between replication and repair leading to this instability remains unclear. Towards understanding how repeat contractions may arise, we performed in vitro SV40-mediated replication of repeat-containing plasmids in the presence or absence of mismatch repair. Specifically, we separated repair from replication: Replication mediated by MutS\u03b2- and MutS\u03b1-deficient human cells or cell extracts produced slipped-DNA heteroduplexes in the contraction- but not expansion-biased replication direction. Replication in the presence of MutS\u03b2 disfavoured the retention of replication products harbouring slipped-DNA heteroduplexes. Post-replication repair of slipped-DNAs by MutS\u03b2-proficient extracts eliminated slipped-DNAs. Thus, a MutS\u03b2-deficiency likely enhances repeat contractions because MutS\u03b2 protects against contractions by repairing template strand slip-outs. Replication deficient in LigaseI or PCNA-interaction mutant LigaseI revealed slipped-DNA formation at lagging strands. Our results reveal that distinct mechanisms lead to expansions or contractions and support inhibition of MutS\u03b2 as a therapeutic strategy to enhance the contraction of expanded repeats.",

However, inter-individual variations in DNA repair capacity plays a key role in modifying breast cancer risk. We review here emerging evidence that two proteins involved in BER \u2013 adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and flap endonuclease 1 (Fen1) \u2013 promote the development of breast cancer through novel mechanisms. APC and Fen1 expression and interaction is increased in breast tumors versus normal cells, APC interacts with and blocks Fen1 activity in Pol-\u03b2-directed LP-BER, and abrogation of LP-BER is linked with cigarette smoke condensate-induced transformation of normal breast epithelial cells. Carcinogens increase expression of APC and Fen1 in spontaneously immortalized human breast epithelial cells, human colon cancer cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Since APC and Fen1 are tumor suppressors, an increase in their levels could protect against carcinogenesis; however, this does not seem to be the case. Elevated Fen1 levels in breast and lung cancer cells may reflect the enhanced proliferation of cancer cells or increased DNA damage in cancer cells compared to normal cells. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor functions of APC and Fen1 is due to their interaction, which may act as a susceptibility factor for breast cancer. The increased interaction of APC and Fen1 may occur due to polypmorphic and/or mutational variation in these genes. Screening of APC and Fen1 polymorphic and/or mutational variations and APC/Fen1 interaction may permit assessment of individual DNA repair capability and the risk for breast cancer development. Such individuals might lower their breast cancer risk by reducing exposure to carcinogens. Stratifying individuals according to susceptibility would greatly assist epidemiologic studies of the impact of suspected environmental carcinogens. Additionally, a mechanistic understanding of the interaction of APC and Fen1 may provide the basis for developing new and effective targeted chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents.",

The rate of RNA synthesis is dramatically elevated in small mammals and correlates quantitatively with the rate of aging among different mammalian species. The rate of RNA synthesis is reduced by caloric restriction and inhibition of TOR pathway signaling, two perturbations that increase lifespan in multiple metazoan species. From bacteria to man, the transcription of a gene has been found to increase the rate at which it is damaged, and a number of lines of evidence suggest that DNA damage is sufficient to induce multiple symptoms associated with normal aging.

In order to better define the features that make some DSBs repair-resistant, XLF-dependent nonhomologous end joining of blunt-ended DSB substrates having the oxidatively modified nonplanar base thymine glycol at the first (Tg1), second (Tg2), third (Tg3) or fifth (Tg5) positions from one 3\u2032 terminus, was examined in human whole-cell extracts. Tg at the third position had little effect on end-joining even when present on both ends of the break. However, Tg as the terminal or penultimate base was a major barrier to end joining (>10-fold reduction in ligated products) and an absolute barrier when present at both ends. Dideoxy trapping of base excision repair intermediates indicated that Tg was excised from Tg1, Tg2 and Tg3 largely if not exclusively after DSB ligation. However, Tg was rapidly excised from the Tg5 substrate, resulting in a reduced level of DSB ligation, as well as slow concomitant resection of the opposite strand. Ligase reactions containing only purified Ku, XRCC4, ligase IV and XLF showed that ligation of Tg3 and Tg5 was efficient and only partially XLF-dependent, whereas ligation of Tg1 and Tg2 was inefficient and only detectable in the presence of XLF. Overall, the results suggest that promoting ligation of DSBs with proximal base damage may be an important function of XLF, but that Tg can still be a major impediment to repair, being relatively resistant to both trimming and ligation.

Base excision repair (BER) is one of the principal mechanisms of defense against oxidative DNA damage, however recent evidences suggest that also nucleotide excision repair (NER) could be involved. The aim of present work was to identify novel differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) risk variants in BER and NER genes. For this purpose, the most strongly associated SNPs within NER and BER genes found in our previous GWAS on DTC were selected and replicated in an independent series of samples for a new case-control study. Although a positive signal was detected at the nominal level of 0.05 for rs7689099 (encoding for an aminoacid change proline to arginine at codon 117 within NEIL3), none of the considered SNPs (i.e. rs7990340 and rs690860 within RFC3, rs3744767 and rs1131636 within RPA1, rs16962916 and rs3136166 in ERCC4, and rs17739370 and rs7689099 in NEIL3) was associated with the risk of DTC when the correction of multiple testing was applied. In conclusion, a role of NER and BER pathways was evoked in the susceptibility to DTC. However, this seemed to be limited to few polymorphic genes and the overall effect size appeared weak.",

     "abstract": "Although chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) affects approximately 5\u201360% of cancer patients, there are currently no treatments available in part due to the fact that the underlying causes of CIPN are not well understood. One contributing factor in CIPN may be persistence of DNA lesions resulting from treatment with platinum-based agents such as cisplatin. In support of this hypothesis, overexpression of the base excision repair (BER) enzyme, apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), reduces DNA damage and protects cultured sensory neurons treated with cisplatin. Here, we address stimulation of APE1\u2019s endonuclease through a small molecule, nicorandil, as a means of mimicking the beneficial effects observed for overexpression of APE1. Nicorandil, was identified through high-throughput screening of small molecule libraries and found to stimulate APE1 endonuclease activity by increasing catalytic efficiency approximately 2-fold. This stimulation is primarily due to an increase in kcat. To prevent metabolism of nicorandil, an approved drug in Europe for the treatment of angina, cultured sensory neurons were pretreated with nicorandil and daidzin, an aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 inhibitor, resulting in decreased DNA damage but not altered transmitter release by cisplatin. This finding suggests that activation of APE1 by nicorandil in cisplatin-treated cultured sensory neurons does not imbalance the BER pathway in contrast to overexpression of the kinetically faster R177A APE1. Taken together, our results suggest that APE1 activators can be used to reduce DNA damage induced by cisplatin in cultured sensory neurons, although further studies will be required to fully assess their protective effects.",

     "abstract": "Iron-dependent oxidative DNA damage in vivo by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, HP) induces copious single-strand(ss)-breaks and base modifications. HP also causes infrequent double-strand DNA breaks, whose relationship to the cell killing is unclear. Since hydrogen peroxide only fragments chromosomes in growing cells, these double-strand breaks were thought to represent replication forks collapsed at direct or excision ss-breaks and to be fully reparable. We have recently reported that hydrogen peroxide kills Escherichia coli by inducing catastrophic chromosome fragmentation, while cyanide (CN) potentiates both the killing and fragmentation. Remarkably, the extreme density of CN\u00a0+\u00a0HP-induced chromosomal double-strand breaks makes involvement of replication forks unlikely. Here we show that this massive fragmentation is further amplified by inactivation of ss-break repair or base-excision repair, suggesting that unrepaired primary DNA lesions are directly converted into double-strand breaks. Indeed, blocking DNA replication lowers CN\u00a0+\u00a0HP-induced fragmentation only \u223c2-fold, without affecting the survival. Once cyanide is removed, recombinational repair in E. coli can mend several double-strand breaks, but cannot mend \u223c100 breaks spread over the entire chromosome. Therefore, double-strand breaks induced by oxidative damage happen at the sites of unrepaired primary one-strand DNA lesions, are independent of replication and are highly lethal, supporting the model of clustered ss-breaks at the sites of stable DNA-iron complexes.",

To assess whether BLM deficiency provokes an increase in HeR in human cells, we transfected an HeR substrate into a BLM-null cell line derived from a BS patient. The substrate contained a thymidine kinase (tk)-neo fusion gene disrupted by the recognition site for endonuclease I-SceI, as well as a functional tk gene to serve as a potential recombination partner for the tk-neo gene. The two tk sequences on the substrate displayed 19% divergence. A double-strand break was introduced by expression of I-SceI and repair events were recovered by selection for G418-resistant clones. Among 181 events recovered, 30 were accomplished via HeR with the balance accomplished by nonhomologous end-joining. The frequency of HeR events in the BS cells was elevated significantly compared to that seen in normal human fibroblasts or in BS cells complemented for BLM expression.

In mice, recombination hot spots were found to be clustered within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region. Several models, that help explain meiotic recombination has been proposed.

     "abstract": "R-loop formation occurs when the nascent RNA hybridizes with the template DNA strand behind the RNA polymerase. R-loops affect a wide range of cellular processes and their use as origins of replication was the first function attributed to them. In Escherichia coli, R-loop formation is promoted by the ATP-dependent negative supercoiling activity of gyrase (gyrA and gyrB) and is inhibited by topoisomerase (topo) I (topA) relaxing transcription-induced negative supercoiling. RNase HI (rnhA) degrades the RNA moiety of R-loops. The depletion of RNase HI activity in topA null mutants was previously shown to lead to extensive DNA relaxation, due to DNA gyrase inhibition, and to severe growth and chromosome segregation defects that were partially corrected by overproducing topo III (topB). Here, DNA gyrase assays in crude cell extracts showed that the ATP-dependent activity (supercoiling) of gyrase but not its ATP-independent activity (relaxation) was inhibited in topA null cells lacking RNase HI. To characterize the cellular event(s) triggered by the absence of RNase HI, we performed a genetic screen for suppressors of the growth defect of topA rnhA null cells. Suppressors affecting genes in replication (holC2::aph and dnaT18::aph) nucleotide metabolism (dcd49::aph), RNA degradation (rne59::aph) and fimbriae synthesis (fimD22::aph) were found to reduce replication from R-loops and to restore supercoiling, thus pointing to a correlation between R-loop-dependent replication in topA rnhA mutants and the inhibition of gyrase activity and growth. Interestingly, the position of fimD on the E. coli chromosome corresponds to the site of one of the five main putative origins of replication from R-loops in rnhA null cells recently identified by next-generation sequencing, thus suggesting that the fimD22::aph mutation inactivated one of these origins. Furthermore, we show that topo III overproduction is unable to complement the growth defect of topA rnhA null mutants at low temperatures that stabilizes hyper-negatively supercoiled DNA.",

Smoking causes DNA damage, including double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), that leads to carcinogenesis. To test the hypothesis that suboptimal DSB repair capacity is associated with risk of SCCHN, we applied a flow cytometry-based method to detect the DSB repair phenotype first in four EBV-immortalized human lymphoblastoid cell lines and then in human peripheral blood T-lymphocytes (PBTLs). With this blood-based laboratory assay, we conducted a pilot case-control study of 100 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated SCCHN and 124 cancer-free controls of non-Hispanic whites. We found that the mean DSB repair capacity level was significantly lower in cases (42.1%) than that in controls (54.4%) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). When we used the median DSB repair capacity level in the controls as the cutoff value for calculating the odds ratios (ORs) with adjustment for age, sex, smoking and drinking status, the cases were more likely than the controls to have a reduced DSB repair capacity (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.93; 95% confidence interval, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04\u20133.56, P\u00a0=\u00a00.037), especially for those subjects who were ever drinkers (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.73; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.17\u20136.35, P\u00a0=\u00a00.020) and had oropharyngeal tumors (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.17; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.06\u20134.45, P\u00a0=\u00a00.035).

Therefore, it is important to measure the variation in radiosensitivity and to identify the genetic factors influencing it.By adopting a pathway specific genotype-phenotype design, we established the variability in cellular radiosensitivity by performing \u03b3-H2AX foci assay in healthy individuals. Further, we genotyped ten selected SNPs in candidate genes XRCC3 (rs861539), XRCC4 (rs1805377), XRCC5 (rs3835), XRCC6 (rs2267437), ATM (rs3218698, rs1800057), LIG4 (rs1805388), NBN (rs1805794), RAD51 (rs1801320) and PRKDC (rs7003908), and analysed their influence on observed variation in radiosensitivity.The rs2267437 polymorphisms in XRCC6 was associated (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0326) with increased DSB induction while rs1805388 in LIG4 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0240) was associated with increased radioresistance. Further, multiple risk alleles decreased the DSB repair capacity in an additive manner. Polymorphisms in candidate DSB repair genes can act individually or in combination to the efficacy of DSB repair process, resulting in variation of cellular radiosensitivity.Current study suggests that \u03b3-H2AX assay may fulfil the role of a rapid and sensitive biomarker that can be used for epidemiological studies to measure variations in radiosensitivity.

Although clinical trials have demonstrated that the combination of CDDP and IR appear to be synergistic in terms of therapeutic efficacy, the mechanism of synergism remains largely uncharacterized. We investigated the role of the DNA damage response (DDR) in CDDP radiosensitization using two NSCLC cell lines. Using clonogenic survival assays, we determined that the cooperative cytotoxicity of CDDP and IR treatment is sequence dependent, requiring administration of CDDP prior to IR (CDDP-IR). We identified and interrogated the unique time and agent-dependent activation of the DDR in NSCLC cells treated with cisplatin-IR combination therapy. Compared to treatment with CDDP or IR alone, CDDP-IR combination treatment led to persistence of \u03b3H2Ax foci, a marker of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), for up to 24\u00a0h after treatment. Interestingly, pharmacologic inhibition of DDR sensor kinases revealed the persistence of \u03b3-H2Ax foci in CDDP-IR treated cells is independent of kinase activation. Taken together, our data suggest that delayed repair of DSBs in NSCLC cells treated with CDDP-IR contributes to CDDP radiosensitization and that alterations of the DDR pathways by inhibition of specific DDR kinases can augment CDDP-IR cytotoxicity by a complementary mechanism.",

Here, we confirm these results using a larger more genetically homogenous Costa Rican DM1 cohort (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Interestingly, we also provide evidence that supports subtle sex-dependent differences in repeat length-dependent age at onset and somatic mutational dynamics. Previously, we demonstrated that variation in the rate of somatic expansion was a heritable quantitative trait. Given the important role that DNA mismatch repair genes play in mediating expansions in mouse models, we tested for modifier gene effects with 13 DNA mismatch gene polymorphisms (one each in MSH2, PMS2, MSH6 and MLH1; and nine in MSH3). After correcting for allele length and age effects, we identified three polymorphisms in MSH3 that were associated with variation in somatic instability: Rs26279 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003); Rs1677658 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009); and Rs10168 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031). However, only the association with Rs26279 remained significant after multiple testing correction. Although we revealed a statistically significant association between Rs26279 and somatic instability, we did not detect an association with the age at onset. Individuals with the A/A genotype for Rs26279 tended to show a greater propensity to expand the CTG repeat than other genotypes. Interestingly, this SNP results in an amino acid change in the critical ATPase domain of MSH3 and is potentially functionally dimorphic. These data suggest that MSH3 is a key player in generating somatic variation in DM1 patients and further highlight MSH3 as a potential therapeutic target.",

Here we investigated the influence of nucleotide excision repair (NER) on 3-NBA-induced mutagenesis of the human tumour suppressor gene TP53 and the reporter gene lacZ. To this end we utilised Xpa -knockout (Xpa-Null) human TP53 knock-in (Hupki) embryo fibroblasts (HUFs). As Xpa is essential for NER of bulky DNA adducts, we hypothesized that DNA adducts induced by 3-NBA would persist in the genomes of Xpa-Null cells and lead to an increased frequency of mutation. The HUF immortalisation assay was used to select for cells harbouring TP53 mutations following mutagen exposure. We found that Xpa-Null Hupki mice and HUFs were more sensitive to 3-NBA treatment than their wild-type (Xpa-WT) counterparts. However, following 3-NBA treatment and immortalisation, a similar frequency of TP53-mutant clones arose from Xpa-WT and Xpa-Null HUF cultures. In cells from both Xpa genotypes G:C\u00a0>\u00a0T:A transversion was the predominant TP53 mutation type and mutations exhibited bias towards the non-transcribed strand.

     "abstract": "In our previous study, low-dose hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) effect was demonstrated for normal fibroblasts (asynchronous and G2-phase enriched) of 4 of the 25 cancer patients investigated. For the rest of patients, HRS was not defined in either of the 2 fibroblast populations. Thus, the study indicated that G2-phase enrichment had no influence on HRS identification. The conclusion contradicts that reported for human tumor cells, and suggests different mechanism of HRS in normal human cells. In the present paper we report, for the first time, the activity of early G2-phase checkpoint after low-dose irradiation in normal fibroblasts of these 4 HRS-positive patients and 4 HRS-negative patients and answer the question regarding the role of this checkpoint in normal human cells. The response of the early G2-phase checkpoint was determined by assessment of the progression of irradiated cells into mitosis using the mitotic marker, phosphorylated histone H3. We found evident differences in the activity of the early G2-phase checkpoint between HRS-positive and HRS-negative fibroblasts. In HRS-positive fibroblasts the checkpoint was not triggered and DNA damage was not recognized after doses lower than 0.2\u00a0Gy resulting in HRS response. On the contrary, in HRS-negative fibroblasts the early G2-phase checkpoint was activated regardless of the dose in the range 0.1\u20132\u00a0Gy. In conclusion, although cell cycle phase has no effect on the presence of HRS effect in normal human fibroblasts, the data reported here indicate that HRS response in these cells is associated with the functioning of early G2-phase checkpoint in a threshold-dose dependent manner, similarly as it takes place in most of human tumor and other cells.",

     "abstract": "The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) machinery in mammals plays critical roles in both mutation avoidance and spermatogenesis. Meiotic analysis of knockout mice of two different MMR genes, Mlh1 and Mlh3, revealed both male and female infertility associated with a defect in meiotic crossing over. In contrast, another MMR gene knockout, Pms2 (Pms2ko/ko), which contained a deletion of a portion of the ATPase domain, produced animals that were male sterile but female fertile. However, the meiotic phenotype of Pms2ko/ko males was less clear-cut than for Mlh1- or Mlh3-deficient meiosis. More recently, we generated a different Pms2 mutant allele (Pms2cre), which results in deletion of the same portion of the ATPase domain. Surprisingly, Pms2cre/cre male mice were completely fertile, suggesting that the ATPase domain of Pms2 is not required for male fertility. To explore the difference in male fertility, we examined the Pms2 RNA and found that alternative splicing of the Pms2cre allele results in a predicted Pms2 containing the C-terminus, which contains the Mlh1-interaction domain, a possible candidate for stabilizing Mlh1 levels. To study further the basis of male fertility, we examined Mlh1 levels in testes and found that whereas Pms2 loss in Pms2ko/ko mice results in severely reduced levels of Mlh1 expression in the testes, Mlh1 levels in Pms2cre/cre testes were reduced to a lesser extent. Thus, we propose that a primary function of Pms2 during spermatogenesis is to stabilize Mlh1 levels prior to its critical crossing over function with Mlh3.",

Such mismatches can be mispairs involving normal or damaged bases or insertion/deletion loops due to strand misalignment. When such mispairs are generated during replication or recombination, MMR will direct removal of an incorrectly paired base or block recombination between nonidentical sequences. However, when mispairs are recognized outside the context of replication, proper strand discrimination between old and new DNA is lost, and MMR can act randomly and mutagenically on mispaired DNA. Such non-canonical actions of MMR are important in somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, expansion of triplet repeats, and potentially in mutations arising in nondividing cells. MMR involvement in damage recognition and signaling is complex, with the end result likely dependent on the amount of DNA damage in a cell.",

     "abstract": "Expanded tandem repeat sequences in DNA are associated with at least 40 human genetic neurological, neurodegenerative, and neuromuscular diseases. Repeat expansion can occur during parent-to-offspring transmission, and arise at variable rates in specific tissues throughout the life of an affected individual. Since the ongoing somatic repeat expansions can affect disease age-of-onset, severity, and progression, targeting somatic expansion holds potential as a therapeutic target. Thus, understanding the factors that regulate this mutation is crucial. DNA repair, in particular mismatch repair (MMR), is the major driving force of disease-associated repeat expansions. In contrast to its anti-mutagenic roles, mammalian MMR curiously drives the expansion mutations of disease-associated (CAG)\u00b7(CTG) repeats. Recent advances have broadened our knowledge of both the MMR proteins involved in disease repeat expansions, including: MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2, and MLH3, as well as the types of repeats affected by MMR, now including: (CAG)\u00b7(CTG), (CGG)\u00b7(CCG), and (GAA)\u00b7(TTC) repeats. Mutagenic slipped-DNA structures have been detected in patient tissues, and the size of the slip-out and their junction conformation can determine the involvement of MMR. Furthermore, the formation of other unusual DNA and R-loop structures is proposed to play a key role in MMR-mediated instability. A complex correlation is emerging between tissues showing varying amounts of repeat instability and MMR expression levels. Notably, naturally occurring polymorphic variants of DNA repair genes can have dramatic effects upon the levels of repeat instability, which may explain the variation in disease age-of-onset, progression and severity. An increasing grasp of these factors holds prognostic and therapeutic potential.",

     "abstract": "The DNA repair pathway mismatch repair (MMR) is responsible for the recognition and correction of DNA biosynthetic errors caused by inaccurate nucleotide incorporation during replication. Faulty MMR leads to failure to address the mispairs or insertion deletion loops (IDLs) left behind by the replicative polymerases and results in increased mutation load at the genome. The realization that defective MMR leads to a hypermutation phenotype and increased risk of tumorigenesis highlights the relevance of this pathway for human disease. The association of MMR defects with increased risk of cancer development was first observed in colorectal cancer patients that carried inactivating germline mutations in MMR genes and the disease was named as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC). Currently, a growing list of cancers is found to be MMR defective and HNPCC has been renamed Lynch syndrome (LS) partly to include the associated risk of developing extra-colonic cancers. In addition, a number of non-hereditary, mostly epigenetic, alterations of MMR genes have been described in sporadic tumors. Besides conferring a strong cancer predisposition, genetic or epigenetic inactivation of MMR genes also renders cells resistant to some chemotherapeutic agents. Therefore, diagnosis of MMR deficiency has important implications for the management of the patients, the surveillance of their relatives in the case of LS and for the choice of treatment. Some of the alterations found in MMR genes have already been well defined and their pathogenicity assessed. Despite this substantial wealth of knowledge, the effects of a large number of alterations remain uncharacterized (variants of uncertain significance, VUSs). The advent of personalized genomics is likely to increase the list of VUSs found in MMR genes and anticipates the need of diagnostic tools for rapid assessment of their pathogenicity. This review describes current tools and future strategies for addressing the relevance of MMR gene alterations in human disease.",

Both conditions are important to recognize clinically as their identification has direct consequences for clinical management and allows targeted preventive actions in mutation carriers. Lynch syndrome is one of the more common adult-onset hereditary tumor syndromes, with thousands of patients reported to date. Its tumor spectrum is well established and includes colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer and a range of other cancer types. However, surveillance for cancers other than colorectal cancer is still of uncertain value. Prophylactic surgery, especially for the uterus and its adnexa is an option in female mutation carriers. Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer with aspirin is actively being investigated in this syndrome and shows promising results. In contrast, the Constitutional Mismatch Repair Deficiency syndrome is rare, features a wide spectrum of childhood onset cancers, many of which are brain tumors with high mortality rates. Future studies are very much needed to improve the care for patients with this severe disorder.",

     "abstract": "DNA damage response machinery (DDR) is an attractive target of cancer therapy. Modulation of DDR network may alter the response of cancer cells to DNA damaging anticancer drugs such as doxorubicin. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of a newly developed imidazopyridine (IAZP) derivative on the DDR after induction of DNA damage in cancer cells by doxorubicin. Cytotoxicity sulphrhodamine-B assay showed a weak anti-proliferative effect of IAZP alone on six cancer cell lines (MCF7, A549, A549DOX11, HepG2, HeLa and M8) and a normal fibroblast strain. Combination of IAZP with doxorubicin resulted in synergism in lung (A549) and breast (MCF7) cancer cells but neither in the other cancer cell lines nor in normal fibroblasts. Molecular studies revealed that synergism is mediated by modulation of DNA damage response and induction of apoptosis. Using constant-field gel electrophoresis and immunofluorescence detection of \u03b3-H2AX foci, IAZP was shown to inhibit the repair of doxorubicin-induced DNA damage in A549 and MCF7 cells. Immunoblot analysis showed that IAZP suppresses the phosphorylation of the ataxia lelangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) protein, which is an important player in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. Moreover, IAZP augmented the doxorubicin-induced degradation of p21, activation of p53, CDK2, caspase 3/7 and phosphorylation of Rb protein. These effects enhanced doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Our results indicate that IAZP is a promising agent that may enhance the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin on some cancer cells through targeting the DDR. It is a preliminary step toward the clinical application of IAZP in combination with anticancer drugs and opens the avenue for the development of compounds targeting the DDR pathway that might improve the therapeutic index of anticancer drugs and enhance their cure rate.",

However, the damage induced by a focused laser beam interacting with a photosensitiser may not fully reflect the types of damage and repair encountered in cells of an animal under typical conditions in vivo. We report on two characteristic stages of recruitment of XRCC1 (a protein engaged in BER and SSB repair pathways), in response to low level DNA damage induced by visible light. We demonstrate that, when just a few DNA breaks are induced in a small region of the nucleus, the recruited XRCC1 is initially distributed uniformly throughout this region, and rearranges into several small stationary foci within minutes. In contrast, when heavy damage of various types (including oxidative damage) is induced in cells pre-sensitized with a DNA-binding drug ethidium bromide, XRCC1 is also recruited but fails to rearrange from the stage of the uniform distribution to the stage of several small foci, indicating that this heavy damage interferes with the progress and completion of the repair processes. We hypothesize that that first stage may reflect recruitment of XRCC1 to poly(ADP-ribose) moieties in the region surrounding the single-strand break, while the second-binding directly to the DNA lesions. We also show that moderate damage or stress induces formation of two types of XRCC1-containing foci differing in their mobility. A large subset of DNA damage-induced XRCC1 foci is associated with a major component of PML nuclear bodies - the Sp100 protein.",

     "abstract": "Cells are constantly exposed to assaults that cause DNA damage, which must be detected and repaired to prevent genome instability. The DNA damage response is mediated by key kinases that activate various signaling pathways. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of these kinases is Mec1, which phosphorylates numerous targets, including H2A and the DNA damage protein Rtt107. In addition to being phosphorylated, Rtt107 contains six BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domains, which typically recognize phospho-peptides. Thus Rtt107 represented an opportunity to study complementary aspects of the phosphorylation cascades within one protein. Here we sought to describe the functional roles of the multiple BRCT domains in Rtt107. Rtt107 BRCT5/6 facilitated recruitment to sites of DNA lesions via its interaction with phosphorylated H2A. Rtt107 BRCT3/4 also contributed to Rtt107 recruitment, but BRCT3/4 was not sufficient for recruitment when BRCT5/6 was absent. Intriguingly, both mutations that affected Rtt107 recruitment also abrogated its phosphorylation. Pointing to its modular nature, replacing Rtt107 BRCT5/6 with the BRCT domains from the checkpoint protein Rad9 was able to sustain Rtt107 function. Although Rtt107 physically interacts with both the endonuclease Slx4 and the DNA replication and repair protein Dpb11, only Slx4 was dependent on Rtt107 for its recruitment to DNA lesions. Fusing Rtt107 BRCT5/6 to Slx4, which presumably allows artificial recruitment of Slx4 to DNA lesions, alleviated some phenotypes of rtt107\u0394 mutants, indicating the functional importance of Slx4 recruitment. Together this data revealed a key function of the Rtt107 BRCT domains for targeting of both itself and its interaction partners to DNA lesions.",

Ultraviolet (UV) light is known to induce two primary forms of DNA damage, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer and the 6-4 photoproduct, both of which destabilize the DNA double helix. The uvs9 strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was isolated based on its sensitivity to UV light and was subsequently shown to have a defect in NER. In this work, the UVS9 gene was cloned through molecular mapping and shown to encode a homolog of XPG, the structure-specific nuclease responsible for cleaving damaged DNA strands 3\u2032 to sites of damage during NER. 3\u2032 RACE revealed that the UVS9 transcript is alternatively polyadenylated.

DMBA metabolism largely depends on activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Mice phenotypically selected for high (AIRmax) or low (AIRmin) acute inflammatory response present a complete segregation of Ahr alleles endowed with low (Ahrd) or high (Ahrb1) affinity to PAHs, respectively. To evaluate the role of AhR genetic polymorphism on the bone marrow susceptibility to DMBA, AIRmax and AIRmin mice were treated with a single intraperitoneal injection of DMBA (50\u00a0mg/kg b.w.) in olive oil. Bone marrow cells (BMCs) were phenotyped by both flow cytometry and cytoslide preparations. Despite a significant decrease in total cell count in BM from AIRmin mice, there was an increase of blast cells and immature neutrophils at 1 and 50 days after DMBA treatment, probably due to a cell-cycle blockade at the G1/S transition leading to immature stage cell production. A panel of proteins related to cell cycle regulation was evaluated in immature BM cells (Lin\u2212) by Western Blot, and DNA damage and repair were measured using an alkaline version of the Comet assay. In Lin\u2212 cells isolated from AIRmin mice, high levels were found in both p53 and p21 protein contents in contrast with the low levels of CDK4 and Ciclin D1. Evaluation of DNA repair in DMBA-treated BMCs, indicated long-lasting genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in BMC from AIRmin mice and a blockade of cell cycle progression. On the other hand, AIRmax mice have a high capacity of DNA damage repair and protection. These mechanisms can be associated with the differential susceptibility to the toxic and carcinogenic effects of DMBA observed in these mice.",

Five different homologs are present in humans, three of which are implicated in accelerated aging genetic disorders: Rothmund Thomson (RECQL4), Werner (WRN), and Bloom (BLM) syndromes. While the DNA helicase activities of the 5 human RecQ helicases have been extensively characterized, much less is known about their DNA double strand annealing activities. Strand annealing is an important integral enzymatic activity in DNA metabolism, including DNA repair. Here, we have characterized the strand annealing activities of all five human RecQ helicase proteins and compared them. Interestingly, the relative strand annealing activities of the five RecQ proteins are not directly (inversely) related to their helicase activities. RECQL5 possesses relatively strong annealing activity on long or small duplexed substrates compared to the other RecQs. Additionally, the strand annealing activity of RECQL5 is not inhibited by the presence of ATP, unlike the other RecQs. We also show that RECQL5 efficiently catalyzes annealing of RNA to DNA in vitro in the presence or absence of ATP, revealing a possible new function for RECQL5. Additionally, we investigate how different known RecQ interacting proteins, RPA, Ku, FEN1 and RAD51, regulate their strand annealing activity. Collectively, we find that the human RecQ proteins possess differential DNA double strand annealing activities and we speculate on their individual roles in DNA repair. This insight is important in view of the many cellular DNA metabolic actions of the RecQ proteins and elucidates their unique functions in the cell.",

     "abstract": "The DNA damage response (DDR) has been broadly defined as a complex network of cellular pathways that cooperate to sense and repair lesions in DNA. Multiple types of DNA damage, some natural DNA sequences, nucleotide pool deficiencies and collisions with transcription complexes can cause replication arrest to elicit the DDR. However, in practice, the term DDR as applied to eukaryotic/mammalian cells often refers more specifically to pathways involving the activation of the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM-Rad3-related) kinases in response to double-strand breaks or arrested replication forks, respectively. Nevertheless, there are distinct responses to particular types of DNA damage that do not involve ATM or ATR. In addition, some of the aberrations that cause replication arrest and elicit the DDR cannot be categorized as direct DNA damage. These include nucleotide pool deficiencies, nucleotide sequences that can adopt non-canonical DNA structures, and collisions between replication forks and transcription complexes. The response to these aberrations can be called the genomic stress response (GSR), a term that is meant to encompass the sensing of all types of DNA aberrations together with the mechanisms involved in coping with them. In addition to fully functional cells, the consequences of processing genomic aberrations may include mutagenesis, genomic rearrangements and lethality.",

     "abstract": "The DNA damage response is a widely used term that encompasses all signaling initiated at DNA lesions and damaged replication forks as it extends to orchestrate DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, cell death and senescence. ATM, an apical DNA damage signaling kinase, is virtually instantaneously activated following the introduction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). The MRE11-RAD50-NBS1 (MRN) complex, which has a catalytic role in DNA repair, and the KAT5 (Tip60) acetyltransferase are required for maximal ATM kinase activation in cells exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation. The sensing of DNA lesions occurs within a highly complex and heterogeneous chromatin environment. Chromatin decondensation and histone eviction at DSBs may be permissive for KAT5 binding to H3K9me3 and H3K36me3, ATM kinase acetylation and activation. Furthermore, chromatin perturbation may be a prerequisite for most DNA repair. Nucleosome disassembly during DNA repair was first reported in the 1970s by Smerdon and colleagues when nucleosome rearrangement was noted during the process of nucleotide excision repair of UV-induced DNA damage in human cells. Recently, the multi-functional protein nucleolin was identified as the relevant histone chaperone required for partial nucleosome disruption at DBSs, the recruitment of repair enzymes and for DNA repair. Notably, ATM kinase is activated by chromatin perturbations induced by a variety of treatments that do not directly cause DSBs, including treatment with histone deacetylase inhibitors. Central to the mechanisms that activate ATR, the second apical DNA damage signaling kinase, outside of a stalled and collapsed replication fork in S-phase, is chromatin decondensation and histone eviction associated with DNA end resection at DSBs. Thus, a stress that is common to both ATM and ATR kinase activation is chromatin perturbations, and we argue that chromatin perturbations are both sufficient and required for induction of the DNA damage response.",

     "abstract": "The disturbance of DNA helix conformation by bulky DNA damage poses hindrance to transcription elongating due to stalling of RNA polymerase at transcription blocking lesions. Stalling of RNA polymerase provokes the formation of R-loops, i.e. the formation of a DNA-RNA hybrid and a displaced single stranded DNA strand as well as displacement of spliceosomes. R-loops are processed into DNA single and double strand breaks by NER factors depending on TC-NER factors leading to genome instability. Moreover, stalling of RNA polymerase induces a strong signal for cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These toxic and mutagenic effects are counteracted by a rapid recruitment of DNA repair proteins to perform transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) to remove the blocking DNA lesions and to restore transcription. Recent studies have highlighted the role of backtracking of RNA polymerase to facilitate TC-NER and identified novel factors that play key roles in TC-NER and in restoration of transcription. On the molecular level these factors facilitate stability of the repair complex by promotion and regulation of various post-translational modifications of NER factors and chromatin substrate. In addition, the continuous flow of new factors that emerge from screening assays hints to several regulatory levels to safeguard the integrity of transcription elongation after disturbance by DNA damage that have yet to be explored.",

Nuclease digestion-assays and psoralen crosslinking have shown that they are open; that is, largely devoid of nucleosomes. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisae, nucleotide excision repair (NER) and photolyase remove UV photoproducts faster from open rRNA genes than from closed and nucleosome-loaded inactive rRNA genes. After UV irradiation, rRNA transcription declines because RNAPI halt at UV photoproducts and are then displaced from the transcribed strand. When the DNA lesion is quickly recognized by NER, it is the sub-pathway transcription-coupled TC-NER that removes the UV photoproduct. If dislodged RNAPI are replaced by nucleosomes before NER recognizes the lesion, then it is the sub-pathway global genome GG-NER that removes the UV photoproducts from the transcribed strand. Also, GG-NER maneuvers in the non-transcribed strand of open genes and in both strands of closed rRNA genes. After repair, transcription resumes and elongating RNAPI reopen the rRNA gene.

Specifically, nucleosome assembly affects DNA damage formation in both random sequences and sequences with strong nucleosome-positioning signals such as 5S rDNA. At least three systems have been used to analyze the effect of nucleosome folding on nucleotide excision repair (NER) in vitro: (a) human cell extracts that have to rely on labeling of repair synthesis to monitor DNA repair, due to very low repair efficacy; (b) Xenopus oocyte nuclear extracts, that have very robust DNA repair efficacy, have been utilized to follow direct removal of DNA damage; (c) six purified human DNA repair factors (RPA, XPA, XPC, TFIIH, XPG, and XPF-ERCC1) that have been used to reconstitute excision repair in vitro.

More recent work in this field aims to understand how BER operates on the natural substrate, chromatin [1], [2]. Toward this end, a number of researchers, including the Smerdon group, have focused attention to understand how individual enzymes and reconstituted BER operate on nucleosome substrates. While nucleosomes were once thought to completely restrict access of DNA-dependent factors, the surprising finding from these studies suggests that at least some BER components can utilize target DNA bound within nucleosomes as substrates for their enzymatic processes. This data correlates well with both structural studies of these enzymes and our developing understanding of nucleosome conformation and dynamics. While more needs to be learned, these studies highlight the utility of reconstituted BER and chromatin systems to inform our understanding of in vivo biological processes.",

     "abstract": "DNA lesions arise from many endogenous and environmental agents, and such lesions can promote deleterious events leading to genomic instability and cell death. Base excision repair (BER) is the main DNA repair pathway responsible for repairing single strand breaks, base lesions and abasic sites in mammalian cells. During BER, DNA substrates and repair intermediates are channeled from one step to the next in a sequential fashion so that release of toxic repair intermediates is minimized. This includes handoff of the product of gap-filling DNA synthesis to the DNA ligation step. The conformational differences in DNA polymerase \u03b2 (pol \u03b2) associated with incorrect or oxidized nucleotide (8-oxodGMP) insertion could impact channeling of the repair intermediate to the final step of BER, i.e., DNA ligation by DNA ligase I or the DNA Ligase III/XRCC1 complex. Thus, modified DNA ligase substrates produced by faulty pol \u03b2 gap-filling could impair coordination between pol \u03b2 and DNA ligase. Ligation failure is associated with 5\u2032-AMP addition to the repair intermediate and accumulation of strand breaks that could be more toxic than the initial DNA lesions. Here, we provide an overview of the consequences of ligation failure in the last step of BER. We also discuss DNA-end processing mechanisms that could play roles in reversal of impaired BER.",

     "abstract": "Base Excision Repair (BER) is a conserved, intracellular DNA repair system that recognizes and removes chemically modified bases to insure genomic integrity and prevent mutagenesis. Aberrant BER has been tightly linked with a broad spectrum of human pathologies, such as several types of cancer, neurological degeneration, developmental abnormalities, immune dysfunction and aging. In the cell, BER must recognize and remove DNA lesions from the tightly condensed, protein-coated chromatin. Because chromatin is necessarily refractory to DNA metabolic processes, like transcription and replication, the compaction of the genomic material is also inhibitory to the repair systems necessary for its upkeep. Multiple ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling (ACR) complexes play essential roles in modulating the protein-DNA interactions within chromatin, regulating transcription and promoting activities of some DNA repair systems, including double-strand break repair and nucleotide excision repair. However, it remains unclear how BER operates in the context of chromatin, and if the chromatin remodelling processes that govern transcription and replication also actively regulate the efficiency of BER. In this review we highlight the emerging role of ACR in regulation of BER.",

Nucleosomes can be repressors by limiting access of factors to regulatory sequences, or activators by facilitating binding of factors to exposed DNA sequences on the surface of the core histones. The formation of UV induced DNA lesions, like cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), is modulated by DNA bending around the core histones. Since CPDs are removed by nucleotide excision repair (NER) and photolyase repair, it is of paramount importance to understand how DNA damage and repair are tempered by the position of nucleosomes. In vitro, nucleosomes inhibit NER and photolyase repair. In vivo, nucleosomes slow down NER and considerably obstruct photoreactivation of CPDs. However, over-expression of photolyase allows repair of nucleosomal DNA in a second time scale. It is proposed that the intrinsic abilities of nucleosomes to move and transiently unwrap could facilitate damage recognition and repair in nucleosomal DNA.",

Technologies were developed to examine NER at nucleotide resolution in yeast sequences of choice and to determine how these related to local changes in chromatin. We focused on how GG-NER relates to histone acetylation for its functioning and we identified the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 and acetylation at lysines 9/14 of histone H3 as a major factor in enabling efficient repair. Factors influencing this Gcn5-mediated event are considered which include Rad16, a GG-NER specific SWI/SNF factor and the yeast histone variant of H2AZ (Htz1). We describe results employing primarily MFA2 as a model gene, but also those with URA3 located at subtelomeric sequences. In the latter case we also see a role for acetylation at histone H4. We then consider the development of a high resolution genome-wide approach that enables one to examine correlations between histone modifications and the NER of UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers throughout entire yeast genome. This is an approach that will enable rapid advances in understanding the complexities of how compacted chromatin in chromosomes is processed to access DNA damage before it is returned to its pre-damaged status to maintain epigenetic codes.",

Damaged DNA that is not properly repaired can lead to genomic instability, driving tumorigenesis. To protect genomic stability, mammalian cells have evolved highly conserved DNA repair mechanisms to remove and repair DNA lesions. Telomeres are composed of long tandem TTAGGG repeats located at the ends of chromosomes. Maintenance of functional telomeres is critical for preventing genome instability. The telomeric sequence possesses unique features that predispose telomeres to a variety of DNA damage induced by environmental genotoxins. This review briefly describes the relevance of excision repair pathways in telomere maintenance, with the focus on base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and mismatch repair (MMR). By summarizing current knowledge on excision repair of telomere damage and outlining many unanswered questions, it is our hope to stimulate further interest in a better understanding of excision repair processes at telomeres and in how these processes contribute to telomere maintenance.",

The steady-state abundance of DNA lesions in a cell is minimized by a variety of DNA repair mechanisms, including DNA strand break repair, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, and ribonucleotide excision repair. The efficiencies and mechanisms by which these pathways remove damage from chromosomes have been primarily characterized by investigating the processing of lesions at defined genomic loci, among bulk genomic DNA, on episomal DNA constructs, or using in vitro substrates. However, the structure of a chromosome is heterogeneous, consisting of heavily protein-bound heterochromatic regions, open regulatory regions, actively transcribed genes, and even areas of transient single stranded DNA. Consequently, DNA repair pathways function in a much more diverse set of chromosomal contexts than can be readily assessed using previous methods. Recent efforts to develop whole genome maps of DNA damage, repair processes, and even mutations promise to greatly expand our understanding of DNA repair and mutagenesis. Here we review the current efforts to utilize whole genome maps of DNA damage and mutation to understand how different chromosomal contexts affect DNA excision repair pathways.",

Alternatively, a library of captured sequences could be generated for a genome wide study of damage sites and large-scale assessment of repair kinetics in different regions of the genome, using next-generation sequencing. The assay is suitable to study any DNA lesion that can be converted into 3\u2019-OH by UVDE, or other enzymes. Toward these goals, we compared UVDE with the classical T4 endonuclease V (T4V) assay.

     "abstract": "DNA polymerase \u03b7 (pol \u03b7) is best characterized for its ability to perform accurate and efficient translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) through cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). To ensure accurate bypass the polymerase is not only required to select the correct base, but also discriminate between NTPs and dNTPs. Most DNA polymerases have a conserved \u201csteric gate\u201d residue which functions to prevent incorporation of NMPs during DNA synthesis. Here, we demonstrate that the Phe35 residue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae pol \u03b7 functions as a steric gate to limit the use of ribonucleotides during polymerization both in vitro and in vivo. Unlike the related pol \u03b9 enzyme, wild-type pol \u03b7 does not readily incorporate NMPs in vitro. In contrast, a pol \u03b7 F35A mutant incorporates NMPs on both damaged and undamaged DNA in vitro with a high degree of base selectivity. An S.cerevisiae strain expressing pol \u03b7 F35A (rad30-F35A) that is also deficient for nucleotide excision repair (rad1\u0394) and the TLS polymerase, pol \u03b6 (rev3\u0394), is extremely sensitive to UV-light. The sensitivity is due, in part, to RNase H2 activity, as an isogenic rnh201\u0394 strain is roughly 50-fold more UV-resistant than its RNH201+ counterpart. Interestingly the rad1\u0394 rev3\u0394 rad30-F35A rnh201\u0394 strain exhibits a significant increase in the extent of spontaneous mutagenesis with a spectrum dominated by 1\u00a0bp deletions at runs of template Ts. We hypothesize that the increased mutagenesis is due to rA incorporation at these sites and that the short poly rA tract is subsequently repaired in an error-prone manner by a novel repair pathway that is specifically targeted to polyribonucleotide tracks. These data indicate that under certain conditions, pol \u03b7 can compete with the cell\u2019s replicases and gain access to undamaged genomic DNA.

NHEJ appears to play a greater role in DSB repair in intestinal tissue since impairment by functional change of Prkdc significantly increases the rate of mis-repair in intestinal but not mammary tissue. HR appears to play a greater role in DSB repair in adult mammary tissue since impaired HR results in significant changes in mammary but not in the intestinal tumorigenesis. This indicates that early DNA damage response and repair is important for cancer susceptibility and plays a role in determining tissue specificity of cancer risk.",

This retardation seen in nucleosomal DNA was alleviated by incubation with CHO-K1 nuclear extract. When clustered DNA damage sites containing bistranded AP sites were present in nucleosomal DNA, efficient cleavage of the AP sites was observed after treatment with nuclear extract. The resultant DSB formation led to DNA dissociating from the histone core and nucleosomal dispersion.

     "abstract": "Type 1A topoisomerases (topos) are ubiquitous enzymes involved in supercoiling regulation and in the maintenance of genome stability. Escherichia coli possesses two type 1A enzymes, topo I (topA) and topo III (topB). Cells lacking both enzymes form very long filaments and have severe chromosome segregation and growth defects. We previously found that RNase HI overproduction or a dnaT::aph mutation could significantly correct these phenotypes. This leads us to hypothesize that they were related to unregulated replication originating from R-loops, i.e. constitutive stable DNA replication (cSDR). cSDR, first observed in rnhA (RNase HI) mutants, is characterized by its persistence for several hours following protein synthesis inhibition and by its requirement for primosome components, including DnaT. Here, to visualize and measure cSDR, the incorporation of the nucleotide analog ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) during replication in E. coli cells pre-treated with protein synthesis inhibitors, was revealed by \u201cclick\u201d labeling with Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488 in fixed cells, and flow cytometry analysis. cSDR was detected in rnhA mutants, but not in wild-type strains, and the number of cells undergoing cSDR was significantly reduced by the introduction of the dnaT::aph mutation. cSDR was also found in topA, double topA topB but not in topB null cells. This result is consistent with the established function of topo I in the inhibition of R-loop formation. Moreover, our finding that topB rnhA mutants are perfectly viable demonstrates that topo III is not uniquely required during cSDR. Thus, either topo I or III can provide the type 1A topo activity that is specifically required during cSDR to allow chromosome segregation.",

These results highly suggest this allele, as well as SLX4L530Q, to be pathogenic. The interacting partner XPF is involved in various DNA repair pathways, and certain XPF mutations cause progeria, Cockayne syndrome (CS), and/or FA phenotypes. Because several atypical xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) phenotype-causing XPF missense mutations are located in the SLX4-interacting region, we suspected the disruption of the interaction with SLX4 in these XPF mutants, thereby causing severer phenotypes. The immunoprecipitation assay of cell extracts revealed that those XPF mutations, except XPFC236R, located in the SLX4-interacting region cause instability of XPF protein, which could be the reason for the FA, progeria and/or CS phenotypes.",

To identify additional genes that control the replication stress response, we performed a three-parameter, high content, whole genome siRNA screen measuring DNA replication before and after a challenge with replication stress as well as a marker of checkpoint kinase signalling.

Metabolic activation of NNK generates a number of DNA adducts including O2-methylthymidine (O2-Me-dT) and O2-[4-(3-pyridyl)-4-oxobut-1-yl]thymidine (O2-POB-dT). To investigate the biological effects of these O2-alkylthymidines in humans, we have replicated plasmids containing a site-specifically incorporated O2-Me-dT or O2-POB-dT in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. The bulkier O2-POB-dT exhibited high genotoxicity and only 26% translesion synthesis (TLS) occurred, while O2-Me-dT was less genotoxic and allowed 55% TLS. However, O2-Me-dT was 20% more mutagenic (mutation frequency (MF) 64%) compared to O2-POB-dT (MF 53%) in HEK293T cells. The major type of mutations in each case was targeted T\u00a0\u2192\u00a0A transversions (56% and 47%, respectively, for O2-Me-dT and O2-POB-dT). Both lesions induced a much lower frequency of T\u00a0\u2192\u00a0G, the dominant mutation in bacteria. siRNA knockdown of the TLS polymerases (pols) indicated that pol \u03b7, pol \u03b6, and Rev1 are involved in the lesion bypass of O2-Me-dT and O2-POB-dT as the TLS efficiency decreased with knockdown of each pol. In contrast, MF of O2-Me-dT was decreased in pol \u03b6 and Rev1 knockdown cells by 24% and 25%, respectively, while for O2-POB-dT, it was decreased by 44% in pol \u03b6 knockdown cells, indicating that these TLS pols are critical for mutagenesis. Additional decrease in both TLS efficiency and MF was observed in cells deficient in pol \u03b6 plus other Y-family pols. This study provided important mechanistic details on how these lesions are bypassed in human cells in both error-free and error-prone manner.",

     "abstract": "DNA lesions arise from many endogenous and environmental agents, and such lesions can promote deleterious events leading to genomic instability and cell death. Base excision repair (BER) is the main DNA repair pathway responsible for repairing single strand breaks, base lesions and abasic sites in mammalian cells. During BER, DNA substrates and repair intermediates are channeled from one step to the next in a sequential fashion so that release of toxic repair intermediates is minimized. This includes handoff of the product of gap-filling DNA synthesis to the DNA ligation step. The conformational differences in DNA polymerase \u03b2 (pol \u03b2) associated with incorrect or oxidized nucleotide (8-oxodGMP) insertion could impact channeling of the repair intermediate to the final step of BER, i.e., DNA ligation by DNA ligase I or the DNA Ligase III/XRCC1 complex. Thus, modified DNA ligase substrates produced by faulty pol \u03b2 gap-filling could impair coordination between pol \u03b2 and DNA ligase. Ligation failure is associated with 5\u2032-AMP addition to the repair intermediate and accumulation of strand breaks that could be more toxic than the initial DNA lesions. Here, we provide an overview of the consequences of ligation failure in the last step of BER. We also discuss DNA-end processing mechanisms that could play roles in reversal of impaired BER.",

Among the proposed mechanisms for Cd toxic effects, its ability to promote oxidative stress and to inhibit, in vitro, the activities of some Base Excision DNA Repair (BER) enzymes, such as hOGG1, XRCC1 and APE1, have been already established. However, the molecular mechanisms at the basis of these processes are largely unknown especially at sub-lethal doses of Cd and no information is available on the effect of Cd on the expression levels of BER enzymes. Here, we show that non-toxic treatment of neuronal cell lines, with pro-mitogenic doses of Cd, promotes a significant time- and dose-dependent down-regulation of DNA polymerase \u03b4 (POLD1) expression through a transcriptional mechanism with a modest effect on Pol\u03b2, XRCC1 and APE1. We further elucidated that the observed transcriptional repression on Pol\u03b4 is acted by through competition by activated p53 on Sp1 at POLD1 promoter and by a squelching effect. We further proved the positive effect of Sp1 not only on POLD1 expression but also on Pol\u03b2, XRCC1 and APE1 expression, suggesting that Sp1 has pleiotropic effects on the whole BER pathway. Our results indicated that Cd-mediated impairment of BER pathway, besides acting on the enzymatic functions of some key proteins, is also exerted at the gene expression level of Pol\u03b4 by acting on the p53\u2013Sp1 regulatory axis.

However, the mechanisms for regulating Exo1 activity in these processes remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that Exo1 activity is regulated by a direct interaction with poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), a prominent posttranslational modification at the sites of DNA damage. This PAR-binding activity promotes the early recruitment of Exo1 to sites of DNA damage, where it is retained through an interaction with PCNA, which interacts with the C-terminus of Exo1. The effects of both PAR and PCNA on Exo1 damage association are antagonized by the 14-3-3 adaptor proteins, which interact with the central domain of Exo1. Although PAR binding inhibits both the exonuclease activity and the 5\u2032 flap endonuclease activity of purified Exo1, the pharmacological blockade of PAR synthesis does not overtly affect DNA double-strand break end resection in a cell free Xenopus egg extract. Thus, the counteracting effects of PAR on Exo1 recruitment and enzymatic activity may enable appropriate resection of DNA ends while preventing unscheduled or improper processing of DNA breaks in cells.",

     "abstract": "Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency gives rise to cisplatin resistance and can lead to poor prognosis in cancers. Various models have been proposed to explain this low level of resistance caused due to loss of MMR proteins. We have shown that MMR proteins are required to maintain cisplatin interstrand cross-links (ICLs) on the DNA leading to increased cellular sensitivity. In our previous studies, we have shown that BER processing of the cisplatin ICLs is mutagenic. Polymerase \u03b2 (Pol\u03b2) can generate mismatches which leads to the activation and the recruitment of mismatch repair proteins. In this paper, we distinguished between the requirement of different downstream MMR proteins for maintaining cisplatin sensitivity. We show that the MutS\u03b1 (MSH2\u2013MSH6) heterocomplex is required to maintain cisplatin sensitivity, whereas the Muts\u03b2 complex has no effect. These results can be correlated with the increased repair of cisplatin ICLs and ICL induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in the resistant cells. Moreover, we show that MLH1 proficient cells displayed a cisplatin sensitive phenotype when compared with the MLH1 deficient cells and the ATPase activity of MLH1 is essential to mediate this effect. Based on these results, we propose that MutS\u03b1 as well as the downstream MMR pathway proteins are essential to maintain a cisplatin sensitive phenotype as a consequence of processing Pol\u03b2 induced mismatches at sites flanking cisplatin ICLs.",

     "abstract": "The resection of 5\u2032-DNA ends at a double-strand break (DSB) is an essential step in recombinational repair, as it exposes 3\u2032 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tails for interaction with a repair template. In mitosis, Exo1 and Sgs1 have a conserved function in the formation of long ssDNA tails, whereas this step in the processing of programmed meiotic DSBs is less well-characterized across model organisms. In budding yeast, which has been most intensely studied in this respect, Exo1 is a major meiotic nuclease. In addition, it exerts a nuclease-independent function later in meiosis in the conversion of DNA joint molecules into ZMM-dependent crossovers. In order to gain insight into the diverse meiotic roles of Exo1, we investigated the effect of Exo1 deletion in the ciliated protist Tetrahymena. We found that Exo1 together with Mre11, but without the help of Sgs1, promotes meiotic DSB end resection. Resection is completely eliminated only if both Mre11 and Exo1 are missing. This is consistent with the yeast model where Mre11 promotes resection in the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 direction and Exo1 in the opposite 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 direction. However, while the endonuclease activity of Mre11 is essential to create an entry site for exonucleases and hence to start resection in budding yeast, Tetrahymena Exo1 is able to create single-stranded DNA in the absence of Mre11. Excluding a possible contribution of the Mre11 cofactor Sae2 (Com1) as an autonomous endonuclease, we conclude that there exists another unknown nuclease that initiates DSB processing in Tetrahymena. Consistent with the absence of the ZMM crossover pathway in Tetrahymena, crossover formation is independent of Exo1.",

     "abstract": "To bypass DNA damage, cells have Y-Family DNA polymerases (DNAPs). One Y-Family-class includes DNAP \u03ba and DNAP IV, which accurately insert dCTP opposite N2-dG adducts, including from the carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BP). Another class includes DNAP \u03b7 and DNAP V, which insert accurately opposite UV-damage, but inaccurately opposite BP-N2-dG. To investigate structural differences between Y-Family-classes, regions are swapped between DNAP IV (a \u03ba/IV-class-member) and Dpo4 (a \u03b7/V-class-member); the kinetic consequences are evaluated via primer-extension studies with a BP-N2-dG-containing template. Four key structural elements are revealed. (1) Y-Family DNAPs have discreet non-covalent contacts between their little finger-domain (LF-Domain) and their catalytic core-domain (CC-Domain), which we call \u201cnon-covalent bridges\u201d (NCBs). Arg37 and Arg38 in DNAP IV\u2019s CC-Domain near the active site form a non-covalent bridge (AS-NCB) by interacting with Glu251 and Asp252, respectively, in DNAP IV\u2019s LF-Domain. Without these interactions dATP/dGTP/dTTP misinsertions increase. DNAP IV\u2019s AS-NCB suppresses misinsertions better than Dpo4's equivalent AS-NCB. (2) DNAP IV also suppresses dATP/dGTP/dTTP misinsertions via a second non-covalent bridge, which is \u223c8\u00a0\u00c5 from the active site (Distal-NCB). Dpo4 has no Distal-NCB, rendering it inferior at dATP/dGTP/dTTP suppression. (3) dCTP insertion is facilitated by the larger minor groove opening near the active site in DNAP IV versus Dpo4, which is sensible given that Watson/Crick-like [dCTP:BP-N2-dG] pairing requires the BP-moiety to be in the minor groove. (4) Compared to Dpo4, DNAP IV has a smaller major groove opening, which suppresses dGTP misinsertion, implying BP-N2-dG bulk in the major groove during Hoogsteen syn-adduct-dG:dGTP pairing. In summary, DNAP IV has a large minor groove opening to enhance dCTP insertion, a plugged major groove opening to suppress dGTP misinsertion, and two non-covalent bridges (near and distal to the active site) to suppress dATP/dGTP/dTTP misinsertions; collectively these four structural features enhance DNAP IV\u2019s dNTP insertion fidelity opposite a BP-N2-dG adduct compared to Dpo4.",

GM0639 cells and two ATM deficient/mutant cells, AT5BIVA and AT2KY were irradiated by carbon ion beam. Thymidine block technique was developed to enrich the G2-phase population. Radiation induced early G2/M checkpoint was quantitatively assess with dual-parameter flow cytometry by detecting the cells positive for phospho-histone H3. The involvement of ATR pathway in HRS/IRR response was detected with pretreatment of specific inhibitors prior to carbon ion beam. The link between the early G2/M checkpoint and HRS/IRR under carbon ion beam was first confirmed in GM0639 cells, through the enrichment of cell population in G2-phase or with Aurora kinase inhibitor that attenuates the transition from G2 to M phase. Interestingly, the early G2/M arrest could still be observed in ATM deficient/mutant cells with an effect of ATR signaling, which was discovered to function in an LET-dependent manner, even as low as 0.2\u00a0Gy for carbon ion radiation. The involvement of ATR pathway in heavy particles induced HRS/IRR was determined with the specific ATR inhibitor in GM0639 cells, which affected the HRS/IRR occurrence similarly as ATM inhibitor.

Since GLI1 and p53 both interact with the coactivator TATA Binding Protein Associated Factor 9 (TAF9), we hypothesized that competition between these transcription factors for TAF9 in cancer cells may contribute to the inhibitory loop and directly affect GLI1 function and cellular phenotype. We showed that TAF9 interacts with the oncogenic GLI family members GLI1 and GLI2 but not GLI3 in cell-free pull-down assays and with GLI1 in rhabdomyosarcoma and osteosarcoma cell lines. Removal of the TAF9-binding acidic alpha helical transactivation domain of GLI1 produced a significant reduction in the ability of GLI1 to transform cells. We then introduced a point mutation into GLI1 (L1052I) that eliminates TAF9 binding and a point mutation into GLI3 (I1510L) that establishes binding. Wild-type and mutant GLI proteins that bind TAF9 showed enhanced transactivating and cell transforming activity compared with those that did not. Therefore, GLI-TAF9 binding appears important for oncogenic activity. We then determined whether wild-type p53 down-regulates GLI function by sequestering TAF9. We showed that p53 binds TAF9 with greater affinity than does GLI1 and that co-expression of p53 with GLI1 or GLI2 down-regulated GLI-induced transactivation, which could be abrogated using mutant forms of GLI1 or p53. This suggests that p53 sequesters TAF9 from GLI1, which may contribute to inhibition of GLI1 activity by p53 and potentially impact therapeutic success of agents targeting GLI-TAF9 interactions in cancer.",

     "abstract": "Retrotransposon expression or mobility is increased with age in multiple species and could promote genome instability or altered gene expression during aging. However, it is unclear whether activation of retrotransposons during aging is an indirect result of global changes in chromatin and gene regulation or a result of retrotransposon-specific mechanisms. Retromobility of a marked chromosomal Ty1 retrotransposon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae was elevated in mother cells relative to their daughter cells, as determined by magnetic cell sorting of mothers and daughters. Retromobility frequencies in aging mother cells were significantly higher than those predicted by cell age and the rate of mobility in young populations, beginning when mother cells were only several generations old. New Ty1 insertions in aging mothers were more strongly correlated with gross chromosome rearrangements than in young cells and were more often at non-preferred target sites. Mother cells were more likely to have high concentrations and bright foci of Ty1 Gag\u2013GFP than their daughter cells. Levels of extrachromosomal Ty1 cDNA were also significantly higher in aged mother cell populations than their daughter cell populations. These observations are consistent with a retrotransposon-specific mechanism that causes retrotransposition to occur preferentially in yeast mother cells as they begin to age, as opposed to activation by phenotypic changes associated with very old age. These findings will likely be relevant for understanding retrotransposons and aging in many organisms, based on similarities in regulation and consequences of retrotransposition in diverse species.",

     "abstract": "MUTYH is a base excision repair (BER) enzyme that prevents mutations in DNA associated with 8-oxoguanine (OG) by catalyzing the removal of adenine from inappropriately formed OG:A base-pairs. Germline mutations in the MUTYH gene are linked to colorectal polyposis and a high risk of colorectal cancer, a syndrome referred to as MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP). There are over 300 different MUTYH mutations associated with MAP and a large fraction of these gene changes code for missense MUTYH variants. Herein, the adenine glycosylase activity, mismatch recognition properties, and interaction with relevant protein partners of human MUTYH and five MAP variants (R295C, P281L, Q324H, P502L, and R520Q) were examined. P281L MUTYH was found to be severely compromised both in DNA binding and base excision activity, consistent with the location of this variation in the iron-sulfur cluster (FCL) DNA binding motif of MUTYH. Both R295C and R520Q MUTYH were found to have low fractions of active enzyme, compromised affinity for damaged DNA, and reduced rates for adenine excision. In contrast, both Q324H and P502L MUTYH function relatively similarly to WT MUTYH in both binding and glycosylase assays. However, P502L and R520Q exhibited reduced affinity for PCNA (proliferation cell nuclear antigen), consistent with their location in the PCNA-binding motif of MUTYH. Whereas, only Q324H, and not R295C, was found to have reduced affinity for Hus1 of the Rad9\u2013Hus1\u2013Rad1 complex, despite both being localized to the same region implicated for interaction with Hus1. These results underscore the diversity of functional consequences due to MUTYH variants that may impact the progression of MAP.",

     "abstract": "Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases are key enzymes involved in the repair of abasic sites and DNA strand breaks. Pathogenic bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains two AP endonucleases: MtbXthA and MtbNfo members of the exonuclease III and endonuclease IV families, which are exemplified by Escherichia coli Xth and Nfo, respectively. It has been shown that both MtbXthA and MtbNfo contain AP endonuclease and 3\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a05\u2032 exonuclease activities. However, it remains unclear whether these enzymes hold 3\u2032-repair phosphodiesterase and nucleotide incision repair (NIR) activities. Here, we report that both mycobacterial enzymes have 3\u2032-repair phosphodiesterase and 3\u2032-phosphatase, and MtbNfo contains in addition a very weak NIR activity. Interestingly, depending on pH, both enzymes require different concentrations of divalent cations: 0.5\u00a0mM MnCl2 at pH 7.6 and 10\u00a0mM at pH 6.5. MtbXthA requires a low ionic strength and 37\u00b0C, while MtbNfo requires high ionic strength (200\u00a0mM KCl) and has a temperature optimum at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. Point mutation analysis showed that D180 and N182 in MtbXthA and H206 and E129 in MtbNfo are critical for enzymes activities. The steady-state kinetic parameters indicate that MtbXthA removes 3\u2032-blocking sugar-phosphate and 3\u2032-phosphate moieties at DNA strand breaks with an extremely high efficiency (kcat/KM\u00a0=\u00a0440 and 1280\u00a0\u00a0\u03bcM-1\u2219min\u22121, respectively), while MtbNfo exhibits much lower 3\u2032-repair activities (kcat/KM\u00a0=\u00a00.26 and 0.65\u00a0\u03bcM-1\u2219min\u22121, respectively). Surprisingly, both MtbXthA and MtbNfo exhibited very weak AP site cleavage activities, with kinetic parameters 100- and 300-fold lower, respectively, as compared with the results reported previously. Expression of MtbXthA and MtbNfo reduced the sensitivity of AP endonuclease-deficient E. coli xth nfo strain to methylmethanesulfonate and H2O2 to various degrees. Taken together, these data establish the DNA substrate specificity of M. tuberculosis AP endonucleases and suggest their possible role in the repair of oxidative DNA damage generated by endogenous and host- imposed factors.",

In this study, for the first time, we discovered that DNA polymerase \u03b2 (pol \u03b2) efficiently bypassed a 5\u2032R-cdA, but inefficiently bypassed a 5\u2032S-cdA during DNA replication and BER. We found that cell extracts from pol \u03b2 wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts exhibited significant DNA synthesis activity in bypassing a cdA lesion located in replication and BER intermediates. However, pol \u03b2 knock-out cell extracts exhibited little DNA synthesis to bypass the lesion. This indicates that pol \u03b2 plays an important role in bypassing a cdA lesion during DNA replication and BER. Furthermore, we demonstrated that pol \u03b2 inserted both a correct and incorrect nucleotide to bypass a cdA at a low concentration. Nucleotide misinsertion was significantly stimulated by a high concentration of pol \u03b2, indicating a mutagenic effect induced by pol \u03b2 lesion bypass synthesis of a 5\u2032,8-cyclopurine-2\u2032-deoxynucleoside. Moreover, we found that bypass of a 5\u2032S-cdA by pol \u03b2 generated an intermediate that failed to be extended by pol \u03b2, resulting in accumulation of single-strand DNA breaks. Our study provides the first evidence that pol \u03b2 plays an important role in bypassing a 5\u2032,8-cyclo-dA during DNA replication and repair, as well as new insight into mutagenic effects and genome instability resulting from pol \u03b2 bypassing of a cdA lesion.",

     "abstract": "Both p53 and BRCA1 are tumor suppressors and are involved in a number of cellular processes including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation, and DNA damage repair. Some studies have suggested that the association of BRCA1 and p53 is required for transcriptional regulation of genes involved in cell replication and DNA repair pathways. However, the relationship between the two proteins in molecular mechanisms of DNA repair is still not clear. Therefore, we sought to determine whether there is a functional link between p53 and BRCA1 in DNA repair. Firstly, using a plasmid recombination substrate, pDR-GFP, integrated into the genome of breast cancer cell line MCF7, we have demonstrated that p53 suppressed Rad51-mediated hyper-recombinational repair by two independent cell models of HPV-E6 induced p53 inactivation and p53 knockdown assay. Our study further indicated that p53 mediated homologous recombination (HR) through inhibiting BRCA1 over-function via mechanism of transcription regulation in response to DNA repair. Since it was found p53 and BRCA1 existed in a protein complex, indicating both proteins may be associated at post-transcriptional level. Moreover, defective p53-induced hyper-recombination was associated with cell radioresistance and chromosomal stability, strongly supporting the involvement of p53 in the inhibition of hyper-recombination, which led to genetic stability and cellular function in response to DNA damage. In addition, it was found that p53 loss rescued BRCA1 deficiency via recovering HR and chromosomal stability, suggesting that p53 is also involved in the HR-inhibition independently of BRCA1. Thus, our data indicated that p53 was involved in inhibiting recombination by both BRCA1-dependent and -independent mechanisms, and there is a functional link between p53-suppression and BRCA1-promotion in regulation of HR activity at transcription level and possible post-transcription level.",

The mutant allele isolated results from a mutation at glutamine codon 488 to a stop codon that would be predicted to lead to truncation of the carboxy-terminal kinase domain of the protein. This mutant (lkh1Q488*) is highly sensitive to ultraviolet light, methyl methanesulfonate, and hydroxyurea. In contrast, a null mutant (lkh1\u0394) deleted of the entire lkh1 gene has a less severe phenotype. No epistasis was observed when an lkh1Q488*rad51\u0394 double mutant was tested for genotoxin sensitivity. However, overexpressing the gene for Rad51, its regulator Brh2, or the Brh2 regulator Dss1 partially restored genotoxin resistance of the lkh1\u0394 and lkh1Q488* mutants. Deletion of lkh1 in a chk1\u0394 mutant enabled these double mutant cells to continue to cycle when challenged with hydroxyurea. lkh1\u0394 and lkh1Q488* mutants were able to complete the meiotic process but exhibited reduced heteroallelic recombination and aberrant chromosome segregation. The observations suggest that Lkh1 serves in some aspect of cell cycle regulation after DNA damage or replication stress and that it also contributes to proper chromosome segregation in meiosis.",

In Caulobacter crescentus, previous work has identified a plethora of genes that are part of the SOS regulon, but the biological roles of several of them remain to be determined. In this study, we report that two genes, hereafter named mmcA and mmcB, are involved in the defense against DNA damage caused by mitomycin C (MMC), but not against lesions induced by other common DNA damaging agents, such as UVC light, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and hydrogen peroxide. mmcA is a conserved gene that encodes a member of the glyoxalases/dioxygenases protein family, and acts independently of known DNA repair pathways. On the other hand, epistasis analysis showed that mmcB acts in the same pathway as imuC (dnaE2), and is required specifically for MMC-induced mutagenesis, but not for that induced by UV light, suggesting a role for MmcB in translesion synthesis-dependent repair of MMC damage. We show that the lack of MMC-induced mutability in the mmcB strain is not caused by lack of proper SOS induction of the imuABC operon, involved in translesion synthesis (TLS) in C. crescentus. Based on this data and on structural analysis of a close homolog, we propose that MmcB is an endonuclease which creates substrates for ImuABC-mediated TLS patches.",

Part of this induced Ap4A is converted into novel derivatives, identified as mono- and di-ADP-ribosylated Ap4A. Gene knockout experiments suggest that DNA ligase III is primarily responsible for the synthesis of damage-induced Ap4A and that PARP1 and PARP2 can both catalyze its ADP-ribosylation. Degradative proteins such as aprataxin may also contribute to the increase. Using a cell-free replication system, Ap4A was found to cause a marked inhibition of the initiation of DNA replicons, while elongation was unaffected.

Cancer cells require MTH1 to avoid incorporation of oxidized dNTPs into DNA that results in mutations and cell death. Inhibition of MTH1 eradicates cancer, validating MTH1 as an anticancer target. By overexpressing MTH1, cancer cells may mediate cancer growth and resist therapy. To date, there is unreliable evidence suggesting that MTH1 is increased in cancer cells, and available methods to measure MTH1 levels are indirect and semi-quantitative. Accurate measurement of MTH1 in disease-free tissues and malignant tumors of patients may be essential for determining if the protein is truly upregulated in cancers, and for the development and use of MTH1 inhibitors in cancer therapy. Here, we present a novel approach involving liquid chromatography\u2013isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry to positively identify and accurately quantify MTH1 in human tissues. We produced full length 15N-labeled MTH1 and used it as an internal standard for the measurements. Following trypsin digestion, seven tryptic peptides of both MTH1 and 15N-MTH1 were identified by their full scan and product ion spectra. These peptides provided a statistically significant protein score that would unequivocally identify MTH1. Next, we identified and quantified MTH1 in human disease-free breast tissues and malignant breast tumors, and in four human cultured cell lines, three of which were cancer cells. Extreme expression of MTH1 in malignant breast tumors was observed, suggesting that cancer cells are addicted to MTH1 for their survival. The approach described is expected to be applicable to the measurement of MTH1 levels in malignant tumors vs. surrounding disease-free tissues in cancer patients. This attribute may help develop novel treatment strategies and MTH1 inhibitors as potential drugs, and guide therapies.",

Using the yeast knockout (YKO) strain collection, high-throughput genetic interaction screens have identified a large set of negative interactions between PBY1 and genes involved in genome stability. In drug sensitivity screens, the YKO collection pby1\u0394 strain exhibits a sensitivity profile typical for genes involved in DNA replication and repair. We show that these findings are not related to loss of Pby1. On the basis of genetic interaction profile similarity, we pinpoint disruption of Holliday junction resolvase Mus81-Mms4 as the mutation responsible for DNA repair phenotypes currently ascribed to pby1. The finding that Pby1 is not a DNA repair factor reconciles discrepancies in the data available for PBY1, and indirectly supports a role for Pby1 in mRNA metabolism.

The frequency of lesion abundance can vary depending on the lesion type. Certain adducts such as oxidative base modifications can be quite numerous, and their effects can be helix-distorting or subtle perturbations to DNA structure. Helicase encounters with specific DNA lesions and more novel forms of DNA damage will be discussed. We will also review the battery of assays that have been used to characterize helicase-catalyzed unwinding of damaged DNA substrates. Characterization of the effects of specific DNA adducts on unwinding by various DNA repair and replication helicases has proven to be insightful for understanding mechanistic and biological aspects of helicase function in cellular DNA metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Species survival depends on the faithful replication of genetic information, which is continually monitored and maintained by DNA repair pathways that correct replication errors and the thousands of lesions that arise daily from the inherent chemical lability of DNA and the effects of genotoxic agents. Nonetheless, neutrally evolving DNA (not under purifying selection) accumulates base substitutions with time (the neutral mutation rate). Thus, repair processes are not 100% efficient. The neutral mutation rate varies both between and within chromosomes. For example it is 10\u201350 fold higher at CpGs than at non-CpG positions. Interestingly, the neutral mutation rate at non-CpG sites is positively correlated with CpG content. Although the basis of this correlation was not immediately apparent, some bioinformatic results were consistent with the induction of non-CpG mutations by DNA repair at flanking CpG sites. Recent studies with a model system showed that in vivo repair of preformed lesions (mismatches, abasic sites, single stranded nicks) can in fact induce mutations in flanking DNA. Mismatch repair (MMR) is an essential component for repair-induced mutations, which can occur as distant as 5\u00a0kb from the introduced lesions. Most, but not all, mutations involved the C of TpCpN (G of NpGpA) which is the target sequence of the C-preferring single-stranded DNA specific APOBEC deaminases. APOBEC-mediated mutations are not limited to our model system: Recent studies by others showed that some tumors harbor mutations with the same signature, as can intermediates in RNA-guided endonuclease-mediated genome editing. APOBEC deaminases participate in normal physiological functions such as generating mutations that inactivate viruses or endogenous retrotransposons, or that enhance immunoglobulin diversity in B cells. The recruitment of normally physiological error-prone processes during DNA repair would have important implications for disease, aging and evolution. This perspective briefly reviews both the bioinformatic and biochemical literature relevant to repair-induced mutagenesis and discusses future directions required to understand the mechanistic basis of this process.",

It can also be a mutational hotspot at CpG dinucleotides as a result of spontaneous hydrolytic deamination of 5mC to thymine. The resulting G\u00b7T mismatch pair is recognized by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and revereted to a G\u00b7C pair. Recent studies have shown that 5mC is consecutively catalyzed into 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), 5-formylcytosine (5fC), and 5-carboxylcytosine (5caC) by a DNA dioxygenase from the ten\u2013eleven translocation (TET) family. Two oxidative cytosine derivatives, 5fC and 5caC, are eliminated by TDG during active DNA demethylation. Therefore, TDG has versatile roles in epigenetic regulation to control the gene expression as well as the DNA repair pathway to prevent mutagenesis. 5fC and 5caC serve as intermediate products of active DNA demethylation and also behave as DNA damages that threaten genomic integrity. Here, we discuss the potential functions of 5mC oxidative derivatives in epigenetic modification and DNA damage.",

DDR, as defined specifically in relation to DSBs, consists of multi-layered regulatory modes including DNA damage sensors, transducers and effectors, through which DSBs are sensed and then repaired via DNAprotein interactions. Unexpectedly, recent studies have revealed a direct role of RNA in the repair of DSBs, including DSB-induced small RNA (diRNA)-directed and RNA-templated DNA repair.

Although intensive efforts have focused on how recombination reactions initiate, far less is known about the molecular events that follow. Based upon biochemical studies, current models propose that RecBCD processes double-strand ends and loads RecA to initiate recombinational repair. However, recent studies have shown that RecBCD plays a critical role in completing replication events on the chromosome through a mechanism that does not involve RecA or recombination. Here, we examine several studies, both early and recent, that suggest RecBCD also operates late in the recombination process \u2013 after initiation, strand invasion, and crossover resolution have occurred. Similar to its role in completing replication, we propose a model in which RecBCD is required to resect and resolve the DNA synthesis associated with homologous recombination at the point where the missing sequences on the broken molecule have been restored. We explain how the impaired ability to complete chromosome replication in recBC and recD mutants is likely to account for the loss of viability and genome instability in these mutants, and conclude that spontaneous double-strand breaks and replication fork collapse occur far less frequently than previously speculated.",

We and others have shown that the structural location of DNA lesions within nucleosomes greatly influences their accessibility to repair enzymes. Indeed, a difference in the location of uracil as small as one-half turn of the DNA backbone on the histone surface can result in a 10-fold difference in the time course of its removal in vitro. In addition, the cell has evolved several interdependent processes capable of enhancing the accessibility of excision repair enzymes to DNA lesions in nucleosomes, including post-translational modification of histones, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and interchange of histone variants in nucleosomes.

Impediments to replication fork progression including difficult to replicate DNA sequences, conflicts with transcription, and DNA damage further add to the genome maintenance challenge. These obstacles frequently cause fork stalling, but only rarely cause a failure to complete replication. Robust mechanisms ensure that stalled forks remain stable and capable of either resuming DNA synthesis or being rescued by converging forks. However, when failures do happen the fork collapses leading to genome rearrangements, cell death and disease. Despite intense interest, the mechanisms to repair damaged replication forks, stabilize them, and ensure successful replication remain only partly understood.

The encounter of replication forks with DNA lesions triggers several cellular responses, including the activation of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), which largely depends upon specialized DNA polymerases with flexible active sites capable of accommodating bulky DNA lesions. A detrimental aspect of TLS is its intrinsic mutagenic nature, and thus the activity of the TLS polymerases must ideally be restricted to synthesis on damaged DNA templates. Despite their potential clinical importance in chemotherapy, TLS inhibitors have been difficult to identify since a direct assay designed to quantify genomic TLS events is still unavailable.

     "abstract": "Hypoxia, as a pervasive feature in the microenvironment of solid tumors, plays a significant role in cancer progression, metastasis, and ultimately clinical outcome. One key cellular consequence of hypoxic stress is the regulation of DNA repair pathways, which contributes to the genomic instability and mutator phenotype observed in human cancers. Tumor hypoxia can vary in severity and duration, ranging from acute fluctuating hypoxia arising from temporary blockages in the immature microvasculature, to chronic moderate hypoxia due to sparse vasculature, to complete anoxia at distances more than 150\u00a0\u03bcM from the nearest blood vessel. Paralleling the intra-tumor heterogeneity of hypoxia, the effects of hypoxia on DNA repair occur through diverse mechanisms. Acutely, hypoxia activates DNA damage signaling pathways, primarily via post-translational modifications. On a longer timescale, hypoxia leads to transcriptional and/or translational downregulation of most DNA repair pathways including DNA double-strand break repair, mismatch repair, and nucleotide excision repair. Furthermore, extended hypoxia can lead to long-term persistent silencing of certain DNA repair genes, including BRCA1 and MLH1, revealing a mechanism by which tumor suppressor genes can be inactivated. The discoveries of the hypoxic modulation of DNA repair pathways have highlighted many potential ways to target susceptibilities of hypoxic cancer cells. In this review, we will discuss the multifaceted hypoxic control of DNA repair at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and epigenetic levels, and we will offer perspective on the future of its clinical implications.",

Although the yeast proteins, Pol4, a Pol X family DNA polymerase, and Rad27, a nuclease, participate in the end processing reactions of NHEJ, the mechanisms underlying the recruitment of these factors to DSBs are not known. Here we demonstrate that Nej1, a NHEJ factor that interacts with and modulates the activity of the NHEJ DNA ligase complex (Dnl4/Lif1), physically and functionally interacts with both Pol4 and Rad27. Notably, Nej1 and Dnl4/Lif1, which also interacts with both Pol4 and Rad27, independently recruit the end processing factors to in vivo DSBs via mechanisms that are additive rather than redundant. As was observed with Dnl4/Lif1, the activities of both Pol4 and Rad27 were enhanced by the interaction with Nej1. Furthermore, Nej1 increased the joining of incompatible DNA ends in reconstituted reactions containing Pol4, Rad27 and Dnl4/Lif1, indicating that the stimulatory activities of Nej1 and Dnl4/Lif1 are also additive. Together our results reveal novel roles for Nej1 in the recruitment of Pol4 and Rad27 to in vivo DSBs and the coordination of the end processing and ligation reactions of NHEJ.",

Bacterial nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) system which consists of the DNA-end-binding enzyme Ku and the multifunctional DNA ligase LigD has been shown to be important for survival of bacteria especially during quiescent states, such as late stationary-phase populations or sporulation. In this study we provide genetic evidence that NHEJ enzymes participate in stationary-phase mutagenesis in a population of carbon-starved Pseudomonas putida. Both the absence of LigD or Ku resulted in characteristic spectra of stationary-phase mutations that differed from each other and also from the wild-type spectrum. This indicates that LigD and Ku may participate also in mutagenic pathways that are independent from each other. Our results also imply that both phosphoesterase (PE) and polymerase (POL) domains of the LigD protein are involved in the occurrence of mutations in starving P. putida. The participation of both Ku and LigD in the occurrence of stationary-phase mutations was further supported by the results of the analysis of mutation spectra in stationary-phase sigma factor RpoS-minus background. The spectra of mutations identified in the RpoS-minus background were also distinct if LigD or Ku was absent. Interestingly, the effects of the presence of these enzymes on the frequency of occurrence of certain types of mutations were different or even opposite in the RpoS-proficient and deficient backgrounds. These results imply that RpoS affects performance of mutagenic pathways in starving P. putida that utilize LigD and/or Ku.",

Based on mouse xenograft experiments, where ERCC1-deficient melanomas were cured by cisplatin therapy, we proposed that inhibition of ERCC1\u2013XPF could enhance the effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy. Here we report the identification and properties of inhibitors against two key targets on ERCC1\u2013XPF.

We also utilised high throughput and in silico screening to identify the first reported inhibitors of the other key target, the XPF endonuclease domain. We demonstrate that two of these compounds display specificity in vitro for ERCC1\u2013XPF over two other endonucleases, bind to ERCC1\u2013XPF, inhibit Nucleotide Excision Repair in two independent assays and specifically sensitise Nucleotide Excision Repair-proficient, but not Nucleotide Excision Repair-deficient human and mouse cells to cisplatin.",

Chemical or genetic inactivation of factors involved in C-NHEJ or HRR, but also their local failure in repair proficient cells, promotes an alternative, error-prone end-joining pathway that serves as backup (A-EJ). There is evidence for the involvement of Artemis endonuclease, a protein deficient in a human radiosensitivity syndrome associated with severe immunodeficiency (RS-SCID), in the processing of subsets of DSBs by HRR or C-NHEJ. It is thought that within HRR or C-NHEJ Artemis processes DNA termini at complex DSBs. Whether Artemis has a role in A-EJ remains unknown. Here, we analyze using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and specialized reporter assays, DSB repair in wild-type pre-B NALM-6 lymphocytes, as well as in their Artemis\u2212/\u2212, DNA ligase 4\u2212/\u2212 (LIG4\u2212/\u2212), and LIG4\u2212/\u2212/Artemis\u2212/\u2212 double mutant counterparts, under conditions allowing evaluation of A-EJ. Our results substantiate the suggested roles of Artemis in C-NHEJ and HRR, but also demonstrate a role for the protein in A-EJ that is confirmed in Artemis deficient normal human fibroblasts.

Defects in both processes are associated with increased susceptibility to cancer. To better understand these processes, we have quantified base selectivity, proofreading and MMR during nuclear DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the absence of proofreading and MMR, the primary leading and lagging strand replicases, polymerase \u025b and polymerase \u03b4 respectively, synthesize DNA in vivo with somewhat different error rates and specificity, and with apparent base selectivity that is more than 100 times higher than measured in vitro. Moreover, leading and lagging strand replication fidelity rely on a different balance between proofreading and MMR. On average, proofreading contributes more to replication fidelity than does MMR, but their relative contributions vary from nearly all proofreading of some mismatches to mostly MMR of other mismatches. Thus accurate replication of the two DNA strands results from a non-uniform and variable balance between error prevention, proofreading and MMR.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the SNPs XPC A499V, XPD K751Q, XRCC1 R399Q, and XRCC3 T241M as potential risk factors and indicators of survival among Caucasian patients. One-hundred-sixty-nine patients as well as 344 healthy controls were included and genotyped with PCR\u2013RFLP. We showed that XPC A499V was associated with increased risk of HNSCC, especially laryngeal carcinoma. Among women, XPD K751Q was associated with increased risk of oral SCC. Furthermore, XPD homozygous mutant individuals had the shortest survival time, a survival time that increased however after full dose radiotherapy. Wild-type individuals of XRCC3 T241M demonstrated an earlier age of onset. HPV-positive never smokers had lower frequencies of p53 mutation. Among HNSCC patients, HPV-positivity was significantly associated with XRCC1 R399Q homozygous mutant genotype. Moreover, combinations of putative risk alleles seemed to act synergistically, increasing the risk of HNSCC. In conclusion, our results suggest that SNPs of the DNA repair genes XPC, XPD, XRCC1, and XRCC3 may affect risk and survival of HNSCC.",

BER is one of the basic DNA repair pathways repairing greater than 20,000 endogenous lesions per cell per day. Proper functioning of XRCC1, one of the most important players in BER, was suggested to be indispensable for effective DNA repair. Despite accumulating evidence of an important role that XRCC1 plays in maintaining genomic stability, the relationship between one of its most predominant variants, R280H (rs25489), and cancer prevalence remains ambiguous. In the current study we functionally characterized the effect of the R280H variant expression on immortal non-transformed mouse mammary epithelial C127 and human breast epithelial MCF10A cells. We found that expression of R280H results in increased focus formation in mouse C127 cells and induces cellular transformation in human MCF10A cells. Cells expressing R280H showed significantly increased levels of chromosomal aberrations and accumulate double strand breaks in the G1 cell cycle phase. Our results confirm a possible link between R280H and genomic instability and suggest that individuals carrying this mutation may be at increased risk of cancer development.",

The heterotrimeric Rad9\u2013Rad1\u2013Hus1 (9\u20131\u20131) clamp is a DNA damage response sensor and can be loaded onto DNA. 9\u20131\u20131 is involved in base excision repair (BER) by interacting with nearly every enzyme in BER. Here, we show that individual 9\u20131\u20131 components play distinct roles in BER directed by MYH DNA glycosylase. Analyses of Hus1 deletion mutants revealed that the interdomain connecting loop (residues 134\u2013155) is a key determinant of MYH binding. Both the N-(residues 1\u2013146) and C-terminal (residues 147\u2013280) halves of Hus1, which share structural similarity, can interact with and stimulate MYH. The Hus1K136A mutant retains physical interaction with MYH but cannot stimulate MYH glycosylase activity. The N-terminal domain, but not the C-terminal half of Hus1 can also bind DNA with moderate affinity. Intact Rad9 expressed in bacteria binds to and stimulates MYH weakly. However, Rad91\u2212266 (C-terminal truncated Rad9) can stimulate MYH activity and bind DNA with high affinity, close to that displayed by heterotrimeric 91\u2212266\u20131\u20131 complexes. Conversely, Rad1 has minimal roles in stimulating MYH activity or binding to DNA. Finally, we show that preferential recruitment of 91\u2212266\u20131\u20131 to 5\u2032-recessed DNA substrates is an intrinsic property of this complex and is dependent on complex formation. Together, our findings provide a mechanistic rationale for unique contributions by individual 9\u20131\u20131 subunits to MYH-directed BER based on subunit asymmetry in protein\u2013protein interactions and DNA binding events.",

     "abstract": "Deinococcus radiodurans (Dr) has a significantly more robust DNA repair response than Escherichia coli (Ec), which helps it survive extremely high doses of ionizing radiation and prolonged periods of desiccation. DrRecA protein plays an essential part in this DNA repair capability. In this study we directly compare the binding of DrRecA and EcRecA to the same set of short, defined single (ss) and double stranded (ds) DNA oligomers. In the absence of cofactors (ATP\u03b3S or ADP), DrRecA binds to dsDNA oligomers more than 20 fold tighter than EcRecA, and binds ssDNA up to 9 fold tighter. Binding to dsDNA oligomers in the absence of cofactor presumably predominantly monitors DNA end binding, and thus suggests a significantly higher affinity of DrRecA for ds breaks. Upon addition of ATP\u03b3S, this species-specific affinity difference is nearly abolished, as ATP\u03b3S significantly decreases the affinity of DrRecA for DNA. Other findings include that: (1) both proteins exhibit a dependence of binding affinity on the length of the ssDNA oligomer, but not the dsDNA oligomer; (2) the salt dependence of binding is modest for both species of RecA, and (3) in the absence of DNA, DrRecA produces significantly shorter and/or fewer free-filaments in solution than does EcRecA. The results suggest intrinsic biothermodynamic properties of DrRecA contribute directly to the more robust DNA repair capabilities of D. radiodurans.",

We developed a novel assay for the repair of \u025b-adducts by AlkB enzymes using oligodeoxynucleotides with a single lesion and specific DNA glycosylases and AP-endonuclease for identification of the repair products. We compared the repair of three \u025b-adducts, 1,N6-ethenoadenine (\u025bA), 3,N4-ethenocytosine (\u025bC) and 1,N2-ethenoguanine (1,N2-\u025bG) by nine bacterial and two human AlkBs, representing four different structural groups defined on the basis of conserved amino acids in the nucleotide recognition lid, engaged in the enzyme binding to the substrate.Two bacterial AlkB proteins, MT-2B (from Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and SC-2B (Streptomyces coelicolor) did not repair these lesions in either double-stranded (ds) or single-stranded (ss) DNA. Three proteins, RE-2A (Rhizobium etli), SA-2B (Streptomyces avermitilis), and XC-2B (Xanthomonas campestris) efficiently removed all three lesions from the DNA substrates. Interestingly, XC-2B and RE-2A are the first AlkB proteins shown to be specialized for \u025b-adducts, since they do not repair methylated bases. Three other proteins, EcAlkB (Escherichia coli), SA-1A, and XC-1B removed \u025bA and \u025bC from ds and ssDNA but were inactive toward 1,N2-\u025bG. SC-1A repaired only \u025bA with the preference for dsDNA. The human enzyme ALKBH2 repaired all three \u025b-adducts in dsDNA, while only \u025bA and \u025bC in ssDNA and repair was less efficient in ssDNA. ALKBH3 repaired only \u025bC in ssDNA. Altogether, we have shown for the first time that some AlkB proteins, namely ALKBH2, RE-2A, SA-2B and XC-2B can repair 1,N2-\u025bG and that ALKBH3 removes only \u025bC from ssDNA.

Breast epithelial cells are known to contain elevated levels of oxidative DNA damage, triggered by hormonally driven growth and its effect on cell metabolism. BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient cells were found to be more sensitive to oxidative stress, modeled by treatment with patho-physiologic concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide exposure leads to oxidative DNA damage induced DNA double strand breaks (DSB) in BRCA-deficient cells causing them to accumulate in S-phase. In addition, after hydrogen peroxide treatment, BRCA deficient cells showed impaired Rad51 foci which are dependent on an intact BRCA1\u2013BRCA2 pathway. These DSB resulted in an increase in chromatid-type aberrations, which are characteristic for BRCA1 and BRCA2-deficient cells. The most common result of oxidative DNA damage induced processing of S-phase DSB is an interstitial chromatid deletion, but insertions and exchanges were also seen in BRCA deficient cells. Thus, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential for the repair of oxidative DNA damage repair intermediates that persist into S-phase and produce DSB. The implication is that oxidative stress plays a role in the etiology of hereditary breast cancer.",

The inhibitors of these proteins are also important to study the pathways in genome integrity maintenance. A prominent example is Ugi, a well known cross-species inhibitor protein of the enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase, responsible for uracil excision from DNA. Here, we report that a Staphylococcus pathogenicity island repressor protein called StlSaPIbov1 (Stl) exhibits potent dUTPase inhibition in Mycobacteria. To our knowledge, this is the first indication of a cross-species inhibitor protein for any dUTPase. We demonstrate that the Staphylococcus aureus Stl and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis dUTPase form a stable complex and that in this complex, the enzymatic activity of dUTPase is strongly inhibited. We also found that the expression of the Stl protein in Mycobacterium smegmatis led to highly increased cellular dUTP levels in the mycobacterial cell, this effect being in agreement with its dUTPase inhibitory role. In addition, Stl expression in M. smegmatis drastically decreased colony forming ability, as well, indicating significant perturbation of the phenotype. Therefore, we propose that Stl can be considered to be a cross-species dUTPase inhibitor and may be used as an important reagent in dUTPase inhibition experiments either in vitro/in situ or in vivo.",

     "abstract": "The repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) is central to the maintenance of genomic integrity. In tumor cells, the ability to repair DSBs predicts response to radiation and many cytotoxic anti-cancer drugs. DSB repair pathways include homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). NHEJ is a template-independent mechanism, yet many NHEJ repair products carry limited genetic changes, which suggests that NHEJ includes mechanisms to minimize error. Proteins required for mammalian NHEJ include Ku70/80, the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), XLF/Cernunnos and the XRCC4:DNA ligase IV complex. NHEJ also utilizes accessory proteins that include DNA polymerases, nucleases, and other end-processing factors. In yeast, mutations of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase (TDP1) reduced NHEJ fidelity. TDP1 plays an important role in repair of topoisomerase-mediated DNA damage and 3\u2032-blocking DNA lesions, and mutation of the human TDP1 gene results in an inherited human neuropathy termed SCAN1. We found that human TDP1 stimulated DNA binding by XLF and physically interacted with XLF to form TDP1:XLF:DNA complexes. TDP1:XLF interactions preferentially stimulated TDP1 activity on dsDNA as compared to ssDNA. TDP1 also promoted DNA binding by Ku70/80 and stimulated DNA-PK activity. Because Ku70/80 and XLF are the first factors recruited to the DSB at the onset of NHEJ, our data suggest a role for TDP1 during the early stages of mammalian NHEJ.",

We have analyzed six transcriptome data sets and one data set on translational regulation of known DNA repair and remodeling genes in synchronized human cells. These data are available through our new database: www.dnarepairgenes.com. Genes that have similar transcription profiles in at least two of our data sets generally agree well with known protein profiles. In brief, long patch base excision repair (BER) is enriched for S phase genes, whereas short patch BER uses genes essentially equally expressed in all cell cycle phases. Furthermore, most genes related to DNA mismatch repair, Fanconi anemia and homologous recombination have their highest expression in the S phase. In contrast, genes specific for direct repair, nucleotide excision repair, as well as non-homologous end joining do not show cell cycle-related expression. Cell cycle regulated chromatin remodeling genes were most frequently confined to G1/S and S. These include e.g. genes for chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) major subunits CHAF1A and CHAF1B; the putative helicases HELLS and ATAD2 that both co-activate E2F transcription factors central in G1/S-transition and recruit DNA repair and chromatin-modifying proteins and DNA double strand break repair proteins; and RAD54L and RAD54B involved in double strand break repair. TOP2A was consistently most highly expressed in G2, but also expressed in late S phase, supporting a role in regulating entry into mitosis. Translational regulation complements transcriptional regulation and appears to be a relatively common cell cycle regulatory mechanism for DNA repair genes. Our results identify cell cycle phases in which different pathways have highest activity, and demonstrate that periodically expressed genes in a pathway are frequently co-expressed. Furthermore, the data suggest that S phase expression and over-expression of some multifunctional chromatin remodeling proteins may set up feedback loops driving cancer cell proliferation.",

Recent work has shown that RNA polymerase II (Pol II) accumulation correlates with AID recruitment. However, a direct link between Pol II and AID abundance has not been tested. We used the DT40 B-cell line to manipulate levels of Pol II by decreasing topoisomerase I (Top1), which relaxes DNA supercoiling in front of the transcription complex. Top1 was decreased by stable transfection of a short hairpin RNA against Top1, which produced an accumulation of Pol II in transcribed genes, compared to cells transfected with sh-control RNA. The increased Pol II density enhanced AID recruitment to variable genes in the \u03bb light chain locus, and resulted in higher levels of somatic hypermutation and gene conversion. It has been proposed by another lab that AID itself might directly suppress Top1 to increase somatic hypermutation. However, we found that in both AID+/+ and AID\u2212/\u2212 B cells from DT40 and mice, Top1 protein levels were identical, indicating that the presence or absence of AID did not decrease Top1 expression.

This semi-quantitative approach allowed us to locate the preferentially targeted residues in DNA-dependent PARPs. In contrast to what has been reported in the literature, automodification of PARP-1 is not predominantly targeted towards its BRCT domain. Our results show that interdomain linker regions that connect the BRCT to the WGR module and the WGR to the PRD domain undergo prominent ADP-ribosylation during PARP-1 automodification. We also found that PARP-1 efficiently automodifies the D-loop structure within its own catalytic fold. Interestingly, additional major ADP-ribosylation sites were identified in functional domains of PARP-1, including all three zinc fingers. Similar to PARP-1, specific residues located within the catalytic sites of PARP-2 and PARP-3 are major targets of automodification following their DNA-dependent activation. Together our results suggest that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation hot spots make a dominant contribution to the overall automodification process.",

     "abstract": "The RECQ4 protein belongs to the RecQ helicase family, which plays crucial roles in genome maintenance. Mutations in the RECQ4 gene are associated with three insidious hereditary disorders: Rothmund\u2013Thomson, Baller\u2013Gerold, and RAPADILINO syndromes. These syndromes are characterized by growth deficiency, radial ray defects, red rashes, and higher predisposition to malignancy, especially osteosarcomas. Within the RecQ family, RECQ4 is the least characterized, and its role in DNA replication and repair remains unknown. We have identified several DNA binding sites within RECQ4. Two are located at the N-terminus and one is located within the conserved helicase domain. N-terminal domains probably cooperate with one another and promote the strong annealing activity of RECQ4. Surprisingly, the region spanning 322\u2013400\u00a0aa shows a very high affinity for branched DNA substrates, especially Holliday junctions. This study demonstrates biochemical activities of RECQ4 that could be involved in genome maintenance and suggest its possible role in processing replication and recombination intermediates.",

At the time, polymerase processivity was thought to be the only function of ring shaped processivity clamps. But studies from many laboratories have identified numerous proteins that bind and function with sliding clamps. Among these processes are mismatch repair and nucleosome assembly. Interestingly, there exist polymerases that are highly processive and do not require clamps. Hence, DNA polymerase processivity does not intrinsically require that sliding clamps evolved for this purpose. We propose that polymerases evolved to require clamps as a way of ensuring that clamps are deposited on newly replicated DNA. These clamps are then used on the newly replicated daughter strands, for processes important to genomic integrity, such as mismatch repair and the assembly of nucleosomes to maintain epigenetic states of replicating cells during development.",

     "abstract": "Numerous genetic studies have provided compelling evidence to establish DNA polymerase \u025b (Pol\u025b) as the primary DNA polymerase responsible for leading strand synthesis during eukaryotic nuclear genome replication. Pol\u025b is a heterotetramer consisting of a large catalytic subunit that contains the conserved polymerase core domain as well as a 3\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a05\u2032 exonuclease domain common to many replicative polymerases. In addition, Pol\u025b possesses three small subunits that lack a known catalytic activity but associate with components involved in a variety of DNA replication and maintenance processes. Previous enzymatic characterization of the Pol\u025b heterotetramer from budding yeast suggested that the small subunits slightly enhance DNA synthesis by Pol\u025b in vitro. However, similar studies of the human Pol\u025b heterotetramer (hPol\u025b) have been limited by the difficulty of obtaining hPol\u025b in quantities suitable for thorough investigation of its catalytic activity. Utilization of a baculovirus expression system for overexpression and purification of hPol\u025b from insect host cells has allowed for isolation of greater amounts of active hPol\u025b, thus enabling a more detailed kinetic comparison between hPol\u025b and an active N-terminal fragment of the hPol\u025b catalytic subunit (p261N), which is readily overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Here, we report the first pre-steady-state studies of fully-assembled hPol\u025b. We observe that the small subunits increase DNA binding by hPol\u025b relative to p261N, but do not increase processivity during DNA synthesis on a single-stranded M13 template. Interestingly, the 3\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a05\u2032 exonuclease activity of hPol\u025b is reduced relative to p261N on matched and mismatched DNA substrates, indicating that the presence of the small subunits may regulate the proofreading activity of hPol\u025b and sway hPol\u025b toward DNA synthesis rather than proofreading.",

It is postulated that CMG is responsible for targeting of Pol \u025b to the leading strand. We isolated a mutator dpb2-100 allele which encodes the mutant form of Dpb2p. We showed previously that Dpb2-100p has impaired interactions with Pol2p, the catalytic subunit of Pol \u025b. Here, we present that Dpb2-100p has strongly impaired interaction with the Psf1 and Psf3 subunits of the GINS complex. Our in vitro results suggest that while dpb2-100 does not alter Pol \u025b\u2019s biochemical properties including catalytic efficiency, processivity or proofreading activity \u2013 it moderately decreases the fidelity of DNA synthesis. As the in vitro results did not explain the strong in vivo mutator effect of the dpb2-100 allele we analyzed the mutation spectrum in vivo. The analysis of the mutation rates in the dpb2-100 mutant indicated an increased participation of the error-prone DNA polymerase zeta in replication. However, even in the absence of Pol \u03b6 activity the presence of the dpb2-100 allele was mutagenic, indicating that a significant part of mutagenesis is Pol \u03b6-independent. A strong synergistic mutator effect observed for transversions in the triple mutant dpb2-100 pol2-4 rev3\u0394 as compared to pol2-4 rev3\u0394 and dpb2-100 rev3\u0394 suggests that in the presence of the dpb2-100 allele the number of replication errors is enhanced. We hypothesize that in the dpb2-100 strain, where the interaction between Pol \u025b and GINS is weakened, the access of Pol \u03b4 to the leading strand may be increased. The increased participation of Pol \u03b4 on the leading strand in the dpb2-100 mutant may explain the synergistic mutator effect observed in the dpb2-100 pol3-5DV double mutant.",

Genetic, biochemical and structural studies demonstrate that the phage \u03b2 hairpin acts as a wedge to separate the primer-end from the template strand in exonuclease complexes. Single amino acid substitutions in the tip of the hairpin or deletion of the hairpin prevent proofreading and create \u201cmutator\u201d DNA polymerases. There is little known, however, about the function of similar hairpin structures in other family B DNA polymerases. We present mutational analysis of the yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) DNA polymerase \u03b4 hairpin. Deletion of the DNA polymerase \u03b4 hairpin (hp\u0394) did not significantly reduce DNA replication fidelity; thus, the \u03b2 hairpin structure in yeast DNA polymerase \u03b4 is not essential for proofreading. However, replication efficiency was reduced as indicated by a slow growth phenotype. In contrast, the G447D amino acid substitution in the tip of the hairpin increased frameshift mutations and sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU). A chimeric yeast DNA polymerase \u03b4 was constructed in which the T4 DNA polymerase hairpin (T4hp) replaced the yeast DNA polymerase \u03b4 hairpin; a strong increase in frameshift mutations was observed and the mutant strain was sensitive to HU and to the pyrophosphate analog, phosphonoacetic acid (PAA). But all phenotypes \u2013 slow growth, HU-sensitivity, PAA-sensitivity, and reduced fidelity, were observed only in the absence of mismatch repair (MMR), which implicates a role for MMR in mediating DNA polymerase \u03b4 replication problems. In comparison, another family B DNA polymerase, DNA polymerase \u025b, has only an atrophied hairpin with no apparent function. Thus, while family B DNA polymerases share conserved motifs and general structural features, the \u03b2 hairpin has evolved to meet specific needs.",

     "abstract": "Discrimination against ribonucleotides by DNA polymerases is critical to preserve DNA integrity. For many DNA polymerases, including those of the Y family, rNTP discrimination has been attributed to steric clashes between a residue near the active site, the steric gate, and the 2\u2032-hydroxyl of the incoming rNTP. Here we used hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) to probe the effects of the steric gate in the Y-family DNA polymerases Escherichia coli DinB and human DNA pol \u03ba. Formation of a ternary complex with a G:dCTP base pair in the active site resulted in slower hydrogen exchange relative to a ternary complex with G:rCTP in the active site. The protection from exchange was localized to regions both distal and proximal to the active site, suggesting that DinB and DNA pol \u03ba adopt different conformations depending on the sugar of the incoming nucleotide. In contrast, when the respective steric gate residues were mutated to alanine, the differences in HDX between the dNTP- and rNTP-bound ternary complexes were attenuated such that for DinB(F13A) and pol \u03ba(Y112A), ternary complexes with either G:dCTP or G:rCTP base pairs had similar HDX profiles. Furthermore, the HDX in these ternary complexes resembled that of the rCTP-bound state rather than the dCTP-bound state of the wild-type enzymes. Primer extension assays confirmed that DinB(F13A) and pol \u03ba(Y112A) do not discriminate against rNTPs to the same extent as the wild-type enzymes. Our observations indicate that the steric gate is crucial for rNTP discrimination because of its role in specifically promoting a dNTP-induced conformational change and that rNTP discrimination occurs in a relatively closed state of the polymerases.",

     "abstract": "The survival of all living organisms is determined by their ability to reproduce, which in turn depends on accurate duplication of chromosomal DNA. In order to ensure the integrity of genome duplication, DNA polymerases are equipped with stringent mechanisms by which they select and insert correctly paired nucleotides with a deoxyribose sugar ring. However, this process is never 100% accurate. To fix occasional mistakes, cells have evolved highly sophisticated and often redundant mechanisms. A good example is mismatch repair (MMR), which corrects the majority of mispaired bases and which has been extensively studied for many years. On the contrary, pathways leading to the replacement of nucleotides with an incorrect sugar that is embedded in chromosomal DNA have only recently attracted significant attention. This review describes progress made during the last few years in understanding such pathways in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Genetic studies in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrated that MMR has the capacity to replace errant ribonucleotides, but only when the base is mispaired. In contrast, the major evolutionarily conserved ribonucleotide repair pathway initiated by the ribonuclease activity of type 2 Rnase H has broad specificity. In yeast, this pathway also requires the concerted action of Fen1 and pol \u03b4, while in bacteria it can be successfully completed by DNA polymerase I. Besides these main players, all organisms contain alternative enzymes able to accomplish the same tasks, although with differing efficiency and fidelity. Studies in bacteria have very recently demonstrated that isolated rNMPs can be removed from genomic DNA by error-free nucleotide excision repair (NER), while studies in yeast suggest the involvement of topoisomerase 1 in alternative mutagenic ribonucleotide processing. This review summarizes the most recent progress in understanding the ribonucleotide repair mechanisms in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.",

Here, we examine the effects of polymerase identity (mammalian Pols \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03ba, and \u03b7), template sequence, dNTP pool size, and reaction temperature on indel errors during in vitro synthesis of mononucleotide microsatellites. We utilized the ratio of insertion to deletion errors as a genetic indicator of mechanism. Strikingly, we observed a statistically significant bias toward deletion errors within mononucleotide repeats for the majority of the 28 DNA template and polymerase combinations examined, with notable exceptions based on sequence and polymerase identity. Using mutator forms of Pol \u03b2 did not substantially alter the error specificity, suggesting that mispairing-misalignment mechanism is not a primary mechanism. Based on our results for mammalian DNA polymerases representing three structurally distinct families, we suggest that dNTP-stabilized mutagenesis may be an alternative mechanism for mononucleotide microsatellite indel mutation. The change from a predominantly dNTP-stabilized mechanism to a strand-slippage mechanism with increasing microsatellite length may account for the differential rates of tandem repeat mutation that are observed genome-wide.",

We show here that PrimPol is able to extend RNA primers with ribonucleotides, even when bypassing 8oxoG lesions, suggesting a potential new scenario for PrimPol as a TLS polymerase assisting transcription. We also show that PrimPol displays a high degree of versatility to accept or induce distortions of both primer and template strands, creating alternative alignments based on microhomology that would serve to skip unreadable lesions and to connect separate strands. In good agreement, PrimPol is highly prone to generate indels at short nucleotide repeats. Finally, an evolutionary view of the relationship between translesion synthesis and primase functions is briefly discussed.",

Pol\u03b7 catalyzes accurate translesion synthesis (TLS) past pyrimidine dimers, the most prominent UV-induced lesions. DNA polymerase \u03b9 (Pol\u03b9) is a paralog of Pol\u03b7 that has been suggested to participate in TLS past UV-induced lesions, but its function in vivo remains uncertain. We have previously reported that Pol\u03b7-deficient and Pol\u03b7/Pol\u03b9 double-deficient mice showed increased susceptibility to UV-induced carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated UV-induced mutation frequencies and spectra in the epidermal cells of Pol\u03b7- and/or Pol\u03b9-deficient mice. While Pol\u03b7-deficient mice showed significantly higher UV-induced mutation frequencies than wild-type mice, Pol\u03b9 deficiency did not influence the frequencies in the presence of Pol\u03b7. Interestingly, the frequencies in Pol\u03b7/Pol\u03b9 double-deficient mice were statistically lower than those in Pol\u03b7-deficient mice, although they were still higher than those of wild-type mice. Sequence analysis revealed that most of the UV-induced mutations in Pol\u03b7-deficient and Pol\u03b7/Pol\u03b9 double-deficient mice were base substitutions at dipyrimidine sites. An increase in UV-induced mutations at both G:C and A:T pairs associated with Pol\u03b7 deficiency suggests that Pol\u03b7 contributes to accurate TLS past both thymine- and cytosine-containing dimers in vivo. A significant decrease in G:C to A:T transition in Pol\u03b7/Pol\u03b9 double-deficient mice when compared with Pol\u03b7-deficient mice suggests that Pol\u03b9 is involved in error-prone TLS past cytosine-containing dimers when Pol\u03b7 is inactivated.",

However, this specialized polymerase is error prone when synthesizing through an undamaged DNA template. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both depletion and overproduction of Pol eta result in mutator phenotypes. Therefore, regulation of the cellular abundance of this enzyme is of particular interest. However, based on the investigation of variously tagged forms of Pol eta, mutually contradictory conclusions have been reached regarding the stability of this polymerase in yeast. Here, we optimized a protocol for the detection of untagged yeast Pol eta and established that the half-life of the native enzyme is 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014\u00a0min in asynchronously growing cultures. Experiments with synchronized cells indicated that the cellular abundance of this translesion polymerase changes throughout the cell cycle. Accordingly, we show that the stability of Pol eta, but not its mRNA level, is cell cycle stage dependent. The half-life of the polymerase is more than fourfold shorter in G1-arrested cells than in those at G2/M. Our results, in concert with previous data for Rev1, indicate that cell cycle regulation is a general property of Y family TLS polymerases in S. cerevisiae.",

     "abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum variant (XP-V) is a rare genetic disease, characterized by sunlight sensitivity and predisposition to cutaneous malignancies. XP-V is caused by a deficiency in DNA polymerase eta (Pol\u03b7) that plays a pivotal role in translesion synthesis by bypassing UV-induced pyrimidine dimers. Previously we identified a new Pol\u03b7 variant containing two missense mutations, one mutation within the bipartite NLS (T692A) and a second mutation on the stop codon (X714W) leading to a longer protein with an extra 8 amino acids (721 instead of 713 AA). First biochemical analysis revealed that this Pol\u03b7 missense variant was barely detectable by western blot. As this mutant is extremely unstable and is nearly undetectable, a definitive measure of its functional deficit in cells has not been explored. Here we report the molecular and cellular characterization of this missense variant. In cell free extracts, the extra 8 amino acids in the C-terminal of Pol\u03b7721 only slightly reduce the bypass efficiency through CPD lesions. In vivo, Pol\u03b7721 accumulates in replication factories and interacts with mUb-PCNA albeit at lower level than Pol\u03b7wt. XP-V cells overexpressing Pol\u03b7721 were only slightly UV-sensitive. Altogether, our data strongly suggest that Pol\u03b7721 is functional and that the patient displays a XP-V phenotype because the mutant protein is excessively unstable. We then investigated the molecular mechanisms involved in this excessive proteolysis. We showed that Pol\u03b7721 is degraded by the proteasome in an ubiquitin-dependent manner and that this proteolysis is independent of the E3 ligases, CRL4cdt2 and Pirh2, reported to promote Pol\u03b7 degradation. We then demonstrated that the extra 8 amino acids of Pol\u03b7721 do not act as a degron but rather induce a conformational change of the Pol\u03b7 C-terminus exposing its bipartite NLS as well as a sequence close to its UBZ to the ubiquitin/proteasome system. Interestingly we showed that the clinically approved proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib restores the levels of Pol\u03b7721 suggesting that this might be a therapeutic approach to preventing tumor development in certain XP-V patients harboring missense mutations.",

     "abstract": "Posttranslational modification of proteins often controls various aspects of their cellular function. Indeed, over the past decade or so, it has been discovered that posttranslational modification of lysine residues plays a major role in regulating translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and perhaps the most appreciated lysine modification is that of ubiquitination. Much of the recent interest in ubiquitination stems from the fact that proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was previously shown to be specifically ubiquitinated at K164 and that such ubiquitination plays a key role in regulating TLS. In addition, TLS polymerases themselves are now known to be ubiquitinated. In the case of human polymerase \u03b7, ubiquitination at four lysine residues in its C-terminus appears to regulate its ability to interact with PCNA and modulate TLS. Within the past few years, advances in global proteomic research have revealed that many proteins involved in TLS are, in fact, subject to a previously underappreciated number of lysine modifications. In this review, we will summarize the known lysine modifications of several key proteins involved in TLS; PCNA and Y-family polymerases \u03b7, \u03b9, \u03ba and Rev1 and we will discuss the potential regulatory effects of such modification in controlling TLS in vivo.",

The Arabidopsis genome encodes two PCNAs with only nine amino acid variations, yet two recent reports indicate that AtPCNA2 plays a more critical role in DNA damage response than AtPCNA1. In this study, it was found that both AtPCNAs were able to functionally complement the essential roles of yeast POL30 (PCNA), but failed to rescue the DNA damage tolerance defect of pol30. Surprisingly, the AtPCNA1-K164R mutation rendered cells more tolerant to DNA damage, which appears to be dependent on PCNA sumoylation but not ubiquitination. Two critical residues proximal in structure to K164 were identified in AtPCNAs that contribute to their differences in DNA damage tolerance, since their amino acid substitutions alter the level of DNA damage tolerance. Collectively, it is concluded that the two AtPCNAs differ in their efficiency for ubiquitination and sumoylation, leading to their differential responses to DNA damage in yeast cells.",

At the molecular level, self-sustaining processes, such as oscillations of transcription\u2013translation feedback loops, control the circadian clock, which in turn regulates a wide variety of cellular processes, including gene expression and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, previous studies reported circadian oscillations in the repair capacity of DNA lesions specifically repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER). However, it is so far only poorly understood if DNA repair pathways other than NER are under circadian control, in particular base excision and DNA strand break repair. In the present study, we analyzed potential day and night variations in the repair of DNA lesions induced by ionizing radiation (i.e., mainly oxidative damage and DNA strand breaks) in living mouse splenocytes using a modified protocol of the automated FADU assay. Our results reveal that splenocytes isolated from mice during the light phase (ZT06) displayed higher DNA repair activity than those of the dark phase (ZT18). As analyzed by highly sensitive and accurate qPCR arrays, these alterations were accompanied by significant differences in expression profiles of genes involved in the circadian clock and DNA repair. Notably, the majority of the DNA repair genes were expressed at higher levels during the light phase (ZT06). This included genes of all major DNA repair pathways with the strongest differences observed for genes of base excision and DNA double strand break repair. In conclusion, here we provide novel evidence that mouse splenocytes exhibit significant differences in the repair of IR-induced DNA damage during the LD cycle, both on a functional and on a gene expression level. It will be interesting to test if these findings could be exploited for therapeutic purposes, e.g. time-of-the-day-specific application of DNA-damaging treatments used against blood malignancies.",

The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has been a challenge for the researchers for a long time because of emergence of drug resistance. The availability of its genome sequence has opened new avenues for research. Antimalarial drugs like chloroquine and mefloquine have been reported to inhibit NER pathway mediated repair reactions and thus promote mutagenesis. Previous studies have validated existence and implied possible association of defective or altered DNA repair pathways with development of drug resistant phenotype in certain P. falciparum strains. We conjecture that a compromised NER pathway in combination with other DNA repair pathways might be conducive for the emergence and sustenance of drug resistance in P. falciparum. Therefore we decided to unravel the components of NER pathway in P. falciparum and using bioinformatics based approaches here we report a genome wide in silico analysis of NER components from P. falciparum and their comparison with the human host. Our results reveal that P. falciparum genome contains almost all the components of NER but we were unable to find clear homologue for p62 and XPC in its genome. The structure modeling of all the components further suggests that their structures are significantly conserved.

This study specifically examines the role of a genome stability protein, Bloom (BLM) in limiting formaldehyde-induced cellular and genetic abnormalities. Here, we show that in the absence of BLM protein, formaldehyde-treated cells exhibited increased cellular sensitivity, an immediate cell cycle arrest, and an accumulation of chromosome radial structures. In addition, live-cell imaging experiments demonstrated that formaldehyde-treated cells are dependent on BLM for timely segregation of daughter cells. Both wild-type and BLM-deficient formaldehyde-treated cells showed an accumulation of 53BP1 and \u03b3H2AX foci indicative of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs); however, relative to wild-type cells, the BLM-deficient cells exhibited delayed repair of formaldehyde-induced DSBs. In response to formaldehyde exposure, we observed co-localization of 53BP1 and BLM foci at the DSB repair site, where ATM-dependent accumulation of formaldehyde-induced BLM foci occurred after the recruitment of 53BP1.

Phosphorylation of Mms21 occurred in unchallenged cells, but was more abundant in the presence of DNA damaging agents. Mass spectrometry identified five phosphorylated serines organized in two regions of Mms21, and two C-terminal serines, S260 and S261, formed part of a Mec1/Tel1 consensus motif. Nonphosphorylatable substitutions of the C-terminal serines, inactivation of Mec1 or removal of the Mms21 C-terminus all abolished Mms21 phosphorylation.

We investigated the formation and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and clustered lesions in human fibroblasts after exposure to sparsely (low-LET; delivered by photons) and densely (high-LET; delivered by carbon ions) ionising radiation. DNA repair factors (pKu70, 53BP1, \u03b3H2AX, and pXRCC1) were detected using immunogold-labelling and electron microscopy, and spatiotemporal DNA damage patterns were analysed within the nuclear ultrastructure at the nanoscale level. By labelling activated Ku-heterodimers (pKu70) the number of DSBs was determined in electron-lucent euchromatin and electron-dense heterochromatin. Directly after low-LET exposure (5\u00a0min post-irradiation), single pKu70 dimers, which reflect isolated DSBs, were randomly distributed throughout the entire nucleus with a linear dose correlation up to 30\u00a0Gy. Most euchromatic DSBs were sensed and repaired within 40\u00a0min, whereas heterochromatic DSBs were processed with slower kinetics. Essentially all DNA lesions induced by low-LET irradiation were efficiently rejoined within 24\u00a0h post-irradiation. High-LET irradiation caused localised energy deposition within the particle tracks, and generated highly clustered DNA lesions with multiple DSBs in close proximity. The dimensions of these clustered lesions along the particle trajectories depended on the chromatin packing density, with huge DSB clusters predominantly localised in condensed heterochromatin. High-LET irradiation-induced clearly higher DSB yields than low-LET irradiation, with up to \u223c500 DSBs per \u03bcm3 track volume, and large fractions of these heterochromatic DSBs remained unrepaired. Hence, the spacing and quantity of DSBs in clustered lesions influence DNA repair efficiency, and may determine the radiobiological outcome.",

     "abstract": "Genome integrity is constantly challenged by endo- and exogenous DNA-damaging factors. The influence of genotoxic agents causes an accumulation of DNA lesions, which if not repaired, become mutations that can cause various abnormalities in a cell metabolism. The main pathway of DSB repair, which is based on non-homologous recombination, is canonical non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ). It has been shown that this mechanism is highly conserved in both Pro- and Eukaryotes. The mechanisms that underlie DSB repair through C-NHEJ have mainly been investigated in mammalian systems, and therefore our knowledge about this process is much more limited as far as plants, and crop plants in particular, are concerned. Recent studies have demonstrated that PARP3 is an important response factor to the presence of DSB in a genome. The aims of this study were to identify the sequence of the barley PARP3 gene, to perform a mutational analysis of the sequence that was identified using the TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) method and to phenotype the mutants that were identified through their exposure to mutagenic treatment with the DSB-inducing chemical \u2013 bleomycin. A functional analysis led to the identification of a series of parp3 alleles. The mutants were characterized using several different approaches, including quantifying the DSB and \u03b3H2AX foci, which validated the function of the HvPARP3 gene in DSB repair in barley. The potential involvement of the HvPARP3 gene in the regulation of telomere length in barley was also analyzed.",

One hypothesis posits that meG toxicity is caused by futile attempts of the mismatch repair (MMR) system to process meG/C or meG/T mispairs arising during replication, while an alternative proposal suggests that the latter lesions activate DNA damage signaling, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis directly. Attempts to elucidate the molecular mechanism of meG-induced cell killing in vivo have been hampered by the fact that the above reagents induce several types of modifications in genomic DNA, which are processed by different repair pathways. In contrast, defined substrates studied in vitro did not undergo replication. We set out to re-examine this phenomenon in replication-competent Xenopus laevis egg extracts, using either phagemid substrates containing a single meG residue, or methylated sperm chromatin.

     "abstract": "In both pro- and eukaryotes, the mutagenic and toxic DNA adduct O6-methylguanine (O6MeG) is subject to repair by alkyltransferase proteins via methyl group transfer. In addition, in prokaryotes, there are proteins with sequence homology to alkyltransferases, collectively designated as alkyltransferase-like (ATL) proteins, which bind to O6-alkylguanine adducts and mediate resistance to alkylating agents. Whether such proteins might enable similar protection in higher eukaryotes is unknown. Here we expressed the ATL protein of Escherichia coli (eATL) in mammalian cells and addressed the question whether it is able to protect them against the cytotoxic effects of alkylating agents. The Chinese hamster cell line CHO-9, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) deficient derivative 43-3B and the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) impaired derivative Tk22-C1 were transfected with eATL cloned in an expression plasmid and the sensitivity to N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) was determined in reproductive survival, DNA double-strand break (DSB) and apoptosis assays. The results indicate that eATL expression is tolerated in mammalian cells and conferes protection against killing by MNNG in both wild-type and 43-3B cells, but not in the MMR-impaired cell line. The protection effect was dependent on the expression level of eATL and was completely ablated in cells co-expressing the human O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). eATL did not protect against cytotoxicity induced by the chloroethylating agent lomustine, suggesting that O6-chloroethylguanine adducts are not target of eATL. To investigate the mechanism of protection, we determined O6MeG levels in DNA after MNNG treatment and found that eATL did not cause removal of the adduct. However, eATL expression resulted in a significantly lower level of DSBs in MNNG-treated cells, and this was concomitant with attenuation of G2 blockage and a lower level of apoptosis. The results suggest that eATL confers protection against methylating agents by masking O6MeG/thymine mispaired adducts, preventing them from becoming a substrate for mismatch repair-mediated DSB formation and cell death.",

We have combined both these abilities into one alkoxyamine, AA3, which reacts with AP sites with a better pH profile and reactivity than ARP. Additionally, AA3 contains an alkyne functionality for bioorthogonal click chemistry that can be used to link a wide variety of biochemical tags to AP sites. We used click chemistry to tag AP sites with biotin and a fluorescent molecule without the use of proteins or enzymes. AA3 has a better reactivity profile than ARP and gives much higher product yields at physiological pH than ARP. It is simpler to use than ARP and its use results in lower background and greater sensitivity for AP site detection. We also show that AA3 inhibits the first enzyme in the repair of abasic sites, APE-1, to about the same extent as methoxyamine. Furthermore, AA3 enhances the ability of an alkylating agent, methylmethane sulfonate, to kill human cells and is more effective in such combination chemotherapy than methoxyamine.",

However, it is not known whether cellular responses to DSBs by genotoxic stressors affect the RAG complex. Using cellular imaging and subcellular fractionation approaches, we show that formation of DSBs by treating cells with DNA damaging agents causes export of nuclear RAG2. Within the cytoplasm, RAG2 exhibited substantial enrichment at the centrosome. Further, RAG2 export was sensitive to inhibition of ATM, and was reversed following DNA repair. The core region of RAG2 was sufficient for export, but not centrosome targeting, and RAG2 export was blocked by mutation of Thr490. In summary, DNA damage triggers relocalization of RAG2 from the nucleus to centrosomes, suggesting a novel mechanism for modulating cellular responses to DSBs in developing lymphocytes.",

However, no attempts have been made to test the various hypotheses derived from these studies in a quantitative way e.g. by using modeling approaches. Here we present the first modeling approach that allows predicting the cell cycle dependent radiosensitivity of repair proficient as well as of repair deficient cell lines after photon irradiation based on a small set of parameters and assumptions.A key element of the model is the classification of DNA damage according to its complexity on the level of chromatin loops of about 2\u00a0Mbp size. Isolated DSB (iDSB), characterized by a single DSB within a chromatin loop, are distinguished from clustered DSB (cDSB), characterized by two or more DSB within a chromatin loop. The class of iDSB is further subdivided into two sub-classes, characterized by the replication status of the corresponding chromatin loop. For iDSB in replicated loops that are in close contact, error-free homologous recombination is assumed to be effective; in unreplicated loops or in replicated loops that have already been separated, iDSB are assumed to be repaired by error-prone non-homologous end joining. cDSB are assumed not to be repairable effectively by neither HR nor NHEJ.Assigning empirically derived lethalities to these three damage classes and pathways, we demonstrate that the model is able to accurately reproduce cell cycle dependent survival probabilities. Notably, the relevant parameters are derived solely from two survival curves for normal, repair proficient cells in G1 and late-S phase. Based on a comparison of model predictions with a large data set reported in the literature, we show that the lethality values for wild type cells are simultaneously predictive for the cell cycle dependent variation of sensitivity observed for HR-deficient and NHEJ-deficient cells.",

The cells, named MEFla (MEFlowAPE1), were hypersensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and showed little activity for repairing AP-sites and MMS induced DNA damage. While these results were consistent with the essential role of APE1 in repair of AP sites, the MEFla cells grew normally and the basal activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases in MEFla was lower than that in the wild-type MEF (MEFwt), indicating the low DNA damage stress in MEFla under the normal growth condition. Oxidative phosphorylation activity in MEFla was lower than in MEFwt, while the glycolysis rates in MEFla were higher than in MEFwt.

     "abstract": "RecQ-like helicases are a highly conserved protein family that functions during DNA repair and, when mutated in humans, is associated with cancer and/or premature aging syndromes. The budding yeast RecQ-like helicase Sgs1 has important functions in double-strand break (DSB) repair of exogenously induced breaks, as well as those that arise endogenously, for example during DNA replication. To further investigate Sgs1's regulation, we analyzed the subcellular localization of a fluorescent fusion of Sgs1 upon DNA damage. Consistent with a role in DSB repair, Sgs1 recruitment into nuclear foci in asynchronous cultures increases after ionizing radiation (IR) and after exposure to the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Yet, despite the importance of Sgs1 in replicative damage repair and in contrast to its elevated protein levels during S-phase, we find that the number of Sgs1 foci decreases upon nucleotide pool depletion by hydroxyurea (HU) treatment and that this negative regulation depends on the intra S-phase checkpoint kinase Mec1. Importantly, we identify the SUMO-targeted ubiquitin ligase (STUbL) complex Slx5\u2013Slx8 as a negative regulator of Sgs1 foci, both spontaneously and upon replicative damage. Slx5\u2013Slx8 regulation of Sgs1 foci is likely conserved in eukaryotes, since expression of the mammalian Slx5\u2013Slx8 functional homologue, RNF4, restores Sgs1 focus number in slx8 cells and furthermore, knockdown of RNF4 leads to more BLM foci in U-2 OS cells. Our results point to a model where RecQ-like helicase subcellular localization is regulated by STUbLs in response to DNA damage, presumably to prevent illegitimate recombination events.",

One driver of oxidative stress that can induce 8-oxodG is inflammation, which can be initiated by the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Oxidative DNA damage is primarily repaired by the base excision repair pathway, initiated by glycosylases targeting specific DNA lesions. 8-oxodG is excised by 8-oxoguanine glycosylase 1 (OGG1). A common Ogg1 allelic variant is S326C-Ogg1, prevalent in Asian and Caucasian populations. S326C-Ogg1 is associated with various forms of cancer, and is inactivated by oxidation. However, whether oxidative stress caused by inflammatory cytokines compromises OGG1 variant repair activity remains unknown. We addressed whether TNF-\u03b1 causes oxidative stress that both induces DNA damage and inactivates S326C-OGG1 via cysteine 326 oxidation. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we found that S326C-OGG1 was inactivated only after exposure to H2O2 or TNF-\u03b1. Treatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine prior to oxidative stress rescued S326C-OGG1 activity, demonstrated by in vitro and cellular repair assays. In contrast, S326C-OGG1 activity was unaffected by potassium bromate, which induces oxidative DNA damage without causing oxidative stress, and presumably cysteine oxidation. This study reveals that Cys326 is vulnerable to oxidation that inactivates S326C-OGG1. Physiologically relevant levels of TNF-\u03b1 simultaneously induce 8-oxodG and inactivate S326C-OGG1. These results suggest a mechanism that could contribute to increased risk of cancer among S326C-Ogg1 homozygous individuals.",

Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) represent the two major pathways by which DSBs are repaired in mammalian cells. We now understand that HR and NHEJ repair are composed of multiple sub-pathways, some of which still remain poorly understood. As such, there is great interest in the development of novel assays to interrogate these key pathways, which could lead to the development of novel therapeutics, and a better understanding of how DSBs are repaired. Furthermore, assays which can measure repair specifically at endogenous chromosomal loci are of particular interest, because of an emerging understanding that chromatin interactions heavily influence DSB repair pathway choice. Here, we present the design and validation of a novel, next-generation sequencing-based approach to study DSB repair at chromosomal loci in cells. We demonstrate that NHEJ repair \u201cfingerprints\u201d can be identified using our assay, which are dependent on the status of key DSB repair proteins. In addition, we have validated that our system can be used to detect dynamic shifts in DSB repair activity in response to specific perturbations. This approach represents a unique alternative to many currently available DSB repair assays, which typical rely on the expression of reporter genes as an indirect read-out for repair. As such, we believe this tool will be useful for DNA repair researchers to study NHEJ repair in a high-throughput and sensitive manner, with the capacity to detect subtle changes in DSB repair patterns that was not possible previously.",

     "abstract": "In addition to its prominence in producing genetic diversity in bacterial species, homologous recombination (HR) plays a key role in DNA repair and damage tolerance. The frequency of HR depends on several factors, including the efficiency of DNA repair systems as HR is involved in recovery of replication forks perturbed by DNA damage. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the major DNA repair pathways involved in repair of a broad range of DNA lesions generally induced by exogenous chemicals or UV-irradiation and its functions in the cells not exposed to DNA-damaging agents have attracted less attention. In this study we have developed an assay that enables to investigate HR between chromosomal loci of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida both in growing and stationary-phase cells. The present assay detects HR events between two non-functional alleles of phenol degrading genes that produce a functional allele and allow the growth of bacteria on phenol as a sole carbon source. Our results indicate that HR between chromosomal loci takes place mainly in the growing cells and the frequency of HR is reduced during the following starvation in NER-proficient P. putida but not in the case when bacteria lack UvrA or UvrB enzymes. The absence of UvrA or UvrB resulted in a hyper-recombination phenotype in P. putida, the cells were filamented and their growth was impaired even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. However, NER-deficient derivatives that overcame growth defects emerged rapidly. Such adaptation resulted in the decline of the frequency of HR. Although HR in actively replicating P. putida was still elevated in the adapted variants of the UvrA- and UvrB-deficient strains, the dynamics of emergence of the recombinants in these strains turned similar to NER-proficient bacteria. Additionally, we observed that HR was enhanced in the absence of the transcription repair coupling factor Mfd in growing cells but not during starvation. The frequency of HR was not affected by the UvrA homologue UvrA2 neither in NER-proficient bacteria nor in the absence of UvrA, suggesting a minor role of UvrA2 in NER. Thus, we conclude that NER functions are important also without exogenously induced DNA damage in P. putida and both transcription-coupled and global genome NER act to suppress HR in growing cells, whereas UvrA and UvrB are involved in the maintenance of the genome integrity also in stationary-phase cells.",

Disruption of the gene encoding RAD51, the protein that catalyzes DNA strand exchange during homologous recombination, results in lethality of mammalian cells. Proteins required for homologous recombination, also play an important role during DNA replication. To explore the role of RAD51 in DNA replication and DSB repair, we used a knock-in strategy to express a carboxy-terminal fusion of green fluorescent protein to mouse RAD51 (mRAD51-GFP) in mouse embryonic stem cells. Compared to wild-type cells, heterozygous mRad51+/wt-GFP embryonic stem cells showed increased sensitivity to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation and mitomycin C. Moreover, gene targeting was found to be severely impaired in mRad51+/wt-GFP embryonic stem cells. Furthermore, we found that mRAD51-GFP foci were not stably associated with chromatin. From these experiments we conclude that this mRad51-GFP allele is an antimorphic allele. When this allele is present in a heterozygous condition over wild-type mRad51, embryonic stem cells are proficient in DNA replication but display defects in homologous recombination and DNA damage repair.",

     "abstract": "Dda, one of three helicases encoded by bacteriophage T4, has been well-characterized biochemically but its biological role remains unclear. It is thought to be involved in origin dependent DNA replication, recombination-dependent replication, anti-recombination, and recombination repair. The Gp32 protein of bacteriophage T4 plays critical roles in DNA replication, recombination, and repair by coordinating protein components of the replication fork and by stabilizing ssDNA. Previous work demonstrated that stimulation of DNA synthesis by Dda helicase appears to require direct Gp32\u2013Dda protein\u2013protein interactions and that Gp32 and Dda form a tight complex in the absence of ssDNA. Here we characterize the effects of Gp32\u2013Dda physical and functional interactions through changes in the duplex DNA unwinding and ATPase activities of Dda helicase in the presence of different variants of Gp32 and different DNA repair and replication intermediate structures. Results show that Gp32\u2013Dda interactions can be enhancing or inhibitory, depending on the Gp32 domain seen by Dda. Protein\u2013protein interactions with Gp32 stimulate the unwinding activity of Dda, an effect associated with increased turnover of ATP, suggesting a higher rate of ATPase-driven translocation. Dda\u2013Gp32 interactions also promote the unwinding of DNA substrates at higher salt concentrations and in the presence of substrate-bound DNA polymerase. Conversely, the formation of Gp32 clusters on ssDNA can inhibit unwinding, suggesting that Gp32\u2013ssDNA formation sterically regulates which portions of replication and recombination intermediates are accessible for processing by Dda helicase. The data suggest a mechanism of replication fork restart in which Gp32 promotes Dda activity in template switching while preventing premature fork progression.",

     "abstract": "The most common mutations in cancer are C to T transitions, but their origin has remained elusive. Recently, mutational signatures of APOBEC-family cytosine deaminases were identified in many common cancers, suggesting off-target deamination of cytosine to uracil as a common mutagenic mechanism. Here we present evidence from mass spectrometric quantitation of deoxyuridine in DNA that shows significantly higher genomic uracil content in B-cell lymphoma cell lines compared to non-lymphoma cancer cell lines and normal circulating lymphocytes. The genomic uracil levels were highly correlated with AID mRNA and protein expression, but not with expression of other APOBECs. Accordingly, AID knockdown significantly reduced genomic uracil content. B-cells stimulated to express endogenous AID and undergo class switch recombination displayed a several-fold increase in total genomic uracil, indicating that B cells may undergo widespread cytosine deamination after stimulation. In line with this, we found that clustered mutations (kataegis) in lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia predominantly carry AID-hotspot mutational signatures. Moreover, we observed an inverse correlation of genomic uracil with uracil excision activity and expression of the uracil-DNA glycosylases UNG and SMUG1. In conclusion, AID-induced mutagenic U:G mismatches in DNA may be a fundamental and common cause of mutations in B-cell malignancies.",

     "abstract": "DNA double strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice following ionizing radiation (IR) is currently an appealing research topic, which is still largely unclear. Our recent paper indicated that the complexity of DSBs is a critical factor that enhances DNA end resection. It has been well accepted that the RPA-coated single strand DNA produced by resection is a signaling structure for ATR activation. Therefore, taking advantage of high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation to effectively produce complex DSBs, we investigated how the complexity of DSB influences the function of ATR pathway on the G2/M checkpoint regulation. Human skin fibroblast cells with or without ATM were irradiated with X rays or heavy ion particles, and dual-parameter flow cytometry was used to quantitatively assess the mitotic entry at early period post radiation by detecting the cells positive for phosphor histone H3. In ATM-deficient cells, ATR pathway played a pivotal role and functioned in a dose- and LET-dependent way to regulate the early G2/M arrest even as low as 0.2\u00a0Gy for heavy ion radiation, which indicated that ATR pathway could be rapidly activated and functioned in an ATM-independent, but DSB complexity-dependent manner following exposure to IR. Furthermore, ATR pathway also functioned more efficiently in ATM-proficient cells to block G2 to M transition at early period of particle radiation exposure. Accordingly, in contrast to ATM inhibitor, ATR inhibitor had a more effective radiosensitizing effect on survival fraction following heavy ion beams as compared with X ray radiation. Taken together, our results reveal that the complexity of DSBs is a crucial factor for the activation of ATR pathway for G2/M checkpoint regulation, and ATM-dependent end resection is not essential for the activation.",

     "abstract": "SUMOylation is a form of post-translational modification involving covalent attachment of SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) polypeptides to specific lysine residues in the target protein. In human cells, there are four SUMO proteins, SUMO1\u20134, with SUMO2 and SUMO3 forming a closely related subfamily. SUMO2/3, in contrast to SUMO1, are predominantly involved in the cellular response to certain stresses, including heat shock. Substantial evidence from studies in yeast has shown that SUMOylation plays an important role in the regulation of DNA replication and repair. Here, we report a proteomic analysis of proteins modified by SUMO2 in response to DNA replication stress in S phase in human cells. We have identified a panel of 22 SUMO2 targets with increased SUMOylation during DNA replication stress, many of which play key functions within the DNA replication machinery and/or in the cellular response to DNA damage. Interestingly, POLD3 was found modified most significantly in response to a low dose aphidicolin treatment protocol that promotes common fragile site (CFS) breakage. POLD3 is the human ortholog of POL32 in budding yeast, and has been shown to act during break-induced recombinational repair. We have also shown that deficiency of POLD3 leads to an increase in RPA-bound ssDNA when cells are under replication stress, suggesting that POLD3 plays a role in the cellular response to DNA replication stress. Considering that DNA replication stress is a source of genome instability, and that excessive replication stress is a hallmark of pre-neoplastic and tumor cells, our characterization of SUMO2 targets during a perturbed S-phase should provide a valuable resource for future functional studies in the fields of DNA metabolism and cancer biology.",

     "abstract": "Quantitating relative 32P-band intensity in gels is desired, e.g., to study primer-extension kinetics of DNA polymerases (DNAPs). Following imaging, multiple 32P-bands are often present in lanes. Though individual bands appear by eye to be simple and well-resolved, scanning reveals they are actually skewed-Gaussian in shape and neighboring bands are overlapping, which complicates quantitation, because slower migrating bands often have considerable contributions from the trailing edges of faster migrating bands. A method is described to accurately quantitate adjacent 32P-bands, which relies on having a standard: a simple skewed-Gaussian curve from an analogous pure, single-component band (e.g., primer alone). This single-component scan/curve is superimposed on its corresponding band in an experimentally determined scan/curve containing multiple bands (e.g., generated in a primer-extension reaction); intensity exceeding the single-component scan/curve is attributed to other components (e.g., insertion products). Relative areas/intensities are determined via pixel analysis, from which relative molarity of components is computed. Common software is used. Commonly used alternative methods (e.g., drawing boxes around bands) are shown to be less accurate. Our method was used to study kinetics of dNTP primer-extension opposite a benzo[a]pyrene-N2-dG-adduct with four DNAPs, including Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4 and Sulfolobus acidocaldarius Dbh. Vmax/Km is similar for correct dCTP insertion with Dpo4 and Dbh. Compared to Dpo4, Dbh misinsertion is slower for dATP (\u223c20-fold), dGTP (\u223c110-fold) and dTTP (\u223c6-fold), due to decreases in Vmax. These findings provide support that Dbh is in the same Y-Family DNAP class as eukaryotic DNAP \u03ba and bacterial DNAP IV, which accurately bypass N2-dG adducts, as well as establish the scan-method described herein as an accurate method to quantitate relative intensity of overlapping bands in a single lane, whether generated from 32P-signals or by other means (e.g., staining).",

Stabilisation of G4 leads to telomere architecture disruption with a consequent detrimental effect on cell proliferation, which makes these agents good candidates for chemotherapeutic purposes. RHPS4 is one of the most effective and well-studied G4 ligands with a very high specificity for telomeric G4.In this work, we tested the in vitro efficacy of RHPS4 in astrocytoma cell lines, and we evaluated whether RHPS4 can act as a radiosensitising agent by destabilising telomeres.In the first part of the study, the response to RHPS4 was investigated in four human astrocytoma cell lines (U251MG, U87MG, T67 and T70) and in two normal primary fibroblast strains (AG01522 and MRC5). Cell growth reduction, histone H2AX phosphorylation and telomere-induced dysfunctional foci (TIF) formation were markedly higher in astrocytoma cells than in normal fibroblasts, despite the absence of telomere shortening. In the second part of the study, the combined effect of submicromolar concentrations of RHPS4 and X-rays was assessed in the U251MG glioblastoma radioresistant cell line. Long-term growth curves, cell cycle analysis and cell survival experiments, clearly showed the synergistic effect of the combined treatment. Interestingly the effect was greater in cells bearing a higher number of dysfunctional telomeres. DNA double-strand breaks rejoining after irradiation revealed delayed repair kinetics in cells pre-treated with the drug and a synergistic increase in chromosome-type exchanges and telomeric fusions.These findings provide the first evidence that exposure to RHPS4 radiosensitizes astrocytoma cells, suggesting the potential for future therapeutic applications.",

Dynamic incorporation of H2A.Z by SWR-C also enhances the ability of exonuclease I (Exo1) to process DNA ends during repair of double strand breaks. Given that Exo1 also participates in DNA replication and mismatch repair, here we test whether SWR-C influences DNA replication fidelity. We find that inactivation of SWR-C elevates the spontaneous mutation rate of a strain encoding a L612M variant of DNA polymerase (Pol) \u03b4, with a single base mutation signature characteristic of lagging strand replication errors. However, this genomic instability does not solely result from reduced Exo1 function, because single base mutator effects are seen in both Exo1-proficient and Exo1-deficient pol3-L612M swr1\u0394 strains. The data are consistent with the possibility that incorporation of the H2A.Z variant by SWR-C may stimulate Exo1 activity, as well as enhance the fidelity of replication by Pol \u03b4, the repair of mismatches generated by Pol \u03b4, or both.",

As human tumour cells typically maintain short equilibrium telomere lengths, we wondered if enforced telomere elongation would positively or negatively impact cell survival.

As an example, we investigated the possibility of repair of an AP site located opposite a minor groove-positioned (+)-trans-BPDE-dG or a base-displaced intercalated (+)-cis-BPDE-dG adduct (BP lesion) by a BER system. Oligonucleotides with single uracil residue in the certain position were annealed with complementary oligonucleotides bearing either a cis- or trans-BP adduct. Digestion with uracil DNA glycosylase was utilized to generate an AP site which was then hydrolyzed by APE1, and the resulting gap was processed by X-family DNA polymerases \u03b2 (Pol\u03b2) and \u03bb (Pol\u03bb), or Y-family polymerase \u03b9 (Pol\u03b9). By varying reaction conditions, namely, Mg2+/Mn2+ replacement/combination and ionic strength decrease, we found that under certain conditions both Pol\u03b2 and Pol\u03b9 can catalyze lesion bypass across both cis- and trans-BP adducts in the presence of physiological dNTP concentrations. Pol\u03b2 and Pol\u03b9 catalyze gap filling trans-lesion synthesis in an error prone manner.

It was reported that APC physically interacts with POL\u03b2 and FEN1, thus blocking LP-BER via APC's DNA repair inhibitory (DRI) domain in vitro. The aim of this study was to elucidate how APC status affects BER and the response of CRC to 5-FU. HCT-116, HT-29, and LOVO cells varying in APC status were treated with 5-FU to evaluate expression, repair, and survival responses. HCT-116 expresses wild-type APC; HT-29 expresses an APC mutant that contains DRI domain; LOVO expresses an APC mutant lacking DRI domain. 5-FU increased the expression of APC and decreased the expression of FEN1 in HCT-116 and HT-29 cells, which were sensitized to 5-FU when compared to LOVO cells. Knockdown of APC in HCT-116 rendered cells resistant to 5-FU, and FEN1 levels remained unchanged. Re-expression of full-length APC in LOVO cells caused sensitivity to 5-FU, and decreased expression of FEN1. These knockdown and addback studies confirmed that the DRI domain is necessary for the APC-mediated reduction in LP-BER and 5-FU. Modelling studies showed that 5-FU can interact with the DRI domain of APC via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. 5-FU resistance in CRC occurs with mutations in APC that disrupt or eliminate the DRI domain's interaction with LP-BER. Understanding the type of APC mutation should better predict 5-FU resistance in CRC than simply characterizing APC status as wild-type or mutant.",

Independent of its role in MMR, Exo1 contributes to long-range resection of DNA double-strand break (DSB) ends to facilitate their repair by homologous recombination (HR), and was recently identified as a component of error-free DNA damage tolerance pathways. Here, we show that Exo1 activity increases the hydroxyurea sensitivity of cells lacking Pol32, a subunit of DNA polymerases \u03b4 and \u03b6. Both, phospho-mimicking and dephospho-mimicking exo1 mutants act as hypermorphs, as evidenced by an increase in HU sensitivity of pol32\u0394 cells, suggesting that they are trapped in an active form and that phosphorylation of Exo1 at residues S372, S567, S587, S692 is necessary, but insufficient, for the accurate regulation of Exo1 activity at stalled replication forks. In contrast, neither phosphorylation status is important for Exo1's role in MMR or in the suppression of genome instability in cells lacking Sgs1 helicase. This ability of an EXO1 deletion to suppress the HU hypersensitivity of pol32\u0394 cells is in contrast to the negative genetic interaction between deletions of EXO1 and POL32 in MMS-treated cells as well as the role of EXO1 in DNA-damage treated rad53 and mec1 mutants.",

A combination of immunofluorescence and live cell imaging of GFP-tagged RPA70 revealed that RPA, in contrast to other replication factors, does not cluster into replication foci, which is explained by its short residence time at ssDNA. In addition to replication, RPA also plays a crucial role in both the pre- and post-incision steps of nucleotide excision repair (NER). Pre-incision factors like XPC and TFIIH accumulate rapidly at locally induced UV-damage and remain visible up to 4\u00a0h. However, RPA did not reach its maximum accumulation level until 3\u00a0h after DNA damage infliction and a chromatin-bound pool remained detectable up to 8\u00a0h, probably reflecting its role during the post-incision step of NER. During the pre-incision steps of NER, RPA could only be visualized at DNA lesions in incision deficient XP-F cells, however without a substantial increase in residence time at DNA damage. Together our data show that RPA is an intrinsically highly dynamic ssDNA-binding complex during both replication and distinct steps of NER.",

Monoubiquitination of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) by Rad6/Rad18 leads to recruitment of translesion polymerases for direct and potentially mutagenic damage bypass. An error-free bypass pathway may be initiated via K63-linked PCNA polyubiquitination by Ubc13/Mms2 and the E3 ligase Rad5 in yeast, or HLTF/SHPRH in vertebrates. For the latter two enzymes, redundancy with a third E3 ligase and alternative functions have been reported. We have previously shown that the Rad6 pathway is involved in somatic hypermutation of immunoglobulin genes in B lymphocytes. Here, we have used knockout strategies targeting expression of the entire SHPRH protein or functionally significant domains in chicken DT40 cells that do not harbor a HLTF ortholog. We show that SHPRH is apparently redundant with another E3 ligase during DNA damage-induced PCNA modification. SHPRH plays no substantial role in cellular resistance to drugs initiating excision repair and the Rad6 pathway, but is important in survival of topoisomerase II inhibitor treatment. Removal of only the C-terminal RING domain does not interfere with this SHPRH function. SHPRH inactivation does not substantially impact on the overall efficacy of Ig diversification. Redundancy of E3 ligases in the Rad6 pathway may be linked to its different functions in genome maintenance and genetic plasticity.",

In human somatic cells, knockdown of RAD51AP1 results in increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and to impaired HR, but the formation of DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci is unaffected. Here, we generated a genetic model system, based on chicken DT40 cells, to assess the phenotype of fully inactivated RAD51AP1 in vertebrate cells. Targeted inactivation of both RAD51AP1 alleles has no effect on either viability or doubling-time in undamaged cells, but leads to increased levels of cytotoxicity after exposure to cisplatin or to ionizing radiation. Interestingly, ectopic expression of GgRAD51AP1, but not of HsRAD51AP1 is able to fully complement in cell survival assays. Notably, in RAD51AP1-deficient DT40 cells the resolution of DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci is greatly slowed down, while their formation is not impaired. We also identify, for the first time, an important role for RAD51AP1 in counteracting both spontaneous and DNA damage-induced replication stress. In human and in chicken cells, RAD51AP1 is required to maintain wild type speed of replication fork progression, and both RAD51AP1-depleted human cells and RAD51AP1-deficient DT40 cells respond to replication stress by a slow-down of replication fork elongation rates. However, increased firing of replication origins occurs in RAD51AP1-/- DT40 cells, likely to ensure the timely duplication of the entire genome. Taken together, our results may explain why RAD51AP1 commonly is overexpressed in tumor cells and tissues, and we speculate that the disruption of RAD51AP1 function could be a promising approach in targeted tumor therapy.",

The resulting mice (inactivated Polk KI mice) were exposed to mitomycin C (MMC), and the frequency of point mutations, micronucleus formation in peripheral erythrocytes, and \u03b3H2AX induction in the bone marrow was determined. The inactivated Polk KI mice exhibited significantly higher frequency of mutations at CpG and GpG sites, micronucleated cells, and \u03b3H2AX foci-positive cells than did the Polk wild-type (Polk+) mice. Recovery from MMC-induced DNA damage, which was evaluated by \u03b3H2AX induction, was retarded in embryonic fibroblasts from the knock-in mice when compared to those from the Polk+ mice. These results suggest that Polk mediates TLS, which suppresses point mutations and DNA double-strand breaks caused by intra- and interstrand cross-links induced by MMC treatment.

     "abstract": "Unrepaired DNA lesions often stall replicative DNA polymerases and are bypassed by translesion synthesis (TLS) to prevent replication fork collapse. Mechanisms of TLS are lesion- and species-specific, with a prominent role of specialized DNA polymerases with relaxed active sites. After nucleotide(s) are incorporated across from the altered base(s), the aberrant primer termini are typically extended by DNA polymerase \u03b6 (pol \u03b6). As a result, pol \u03b6 is responsible for most DNA damage-induced mutations. The mechanisms of sequential DNA polymerase switches in vivo remain unclear. The major replicative DNA polymerase \u03b4 (pol \u03b4) shares two accessory subunits, called Pol31/Pol32 in yeast, with pol \u03b6. Inclusion of Pol31/Pol32 in the pol \u03b4/pol \u03b6 holoenzymes requires a [4Fe\u20134S] cluster in C-termini of the catalytic subunits. Disruption of this cluster in Pol \u03b6 or deletion of POL32 attenuates induced mutagenesis. Here we describe a novel mutation affecting the catalytic subunit of pol \u03b6, rev3\u0394C, which provides insight into the regulation of pol switches. Strains with Rev3\u0394C, lacking the entire C-terminal domain and therefore the platform for Pol31/Pol32 binding, are partially proficient in Pol32-dependent UV-induced mutagenesis. This suggests an additional role of Pol32 in TLS, beyond being a pol \u03b6 subunit, related to pol \u03b4. In search for members of this regulatory pathway, we examined the effects of Maintenance of Genome Stability 1 (Mgs1) protein on mutagenesis in the absence of Rev3\u2013Pol31/Pol32 interaction. Mgs1 may compete with Pol32 for binding to PCNA. Mgs1 overproduction suppresses induced mutagenesis, but had no effect on UV-mutagenesis in the rev3\u0394C strain, suggesting that Mgs1 exerts its inhibitory effect by acting specifically on Pol32 bound to pol \u03b6. The evidence for differential regulation of Pol32 in pol \u03b4 and pol \u03b6 emphasizes the complexity of polymerase switches.",

Pfh1 promoted semi-conservative replication through telomeric DNA, as replication forks moved more slowly through telomeres when Pfh1 levels were reduced. Unlike other organisms, S. pombe cells overexpressing Pfh1 displayed markedly longer telomeres. Because this lengthening occurred in the absence of homologous recombination but not in a replication protein A mutant (rad11-D223Y) that has defects in telomerase function, it is probably telomerase-mediated. The effects of Pfh1 on telomere replication and telomere length are likely direct as Pfh1 exhibited high telomere binding in cells expressing endogenous levels of Pfh1.

This modification can be removed by the hydrolytic action of poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) and ADP-ribosylhydrolase 3 (ARH3). Hydrolytic activity of macrodomain proteins (MacroD1, MacroD2 and TARG1) is responsible for the removal of terminal ADP-ribose unit and for complete reversion of protein ADP-ribosylation.Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is widely utilized in eukaryotes and PARPs are present in representatives from all six major eukaryotic supergroups, with only a small number of eukaryotic species that do not possess PARP genes.

Distribution of PARGs strictly follows the distribution of PARP proteins in eukaryotic species. At least one of the macrodomain proteins that hydrolyse terminal ADP-ribose is also always present. Therefore, we can presume that the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes possessed a fully functional and reversible PAR metabolism and that PAR signalling provided the conditions essential for survival of the ancestral eukaryote in its ancient environment.PARP proteins are far less prevalent in bacteria and were probably gained through horizontal gene transfer. Only eleven bacterial species possess all proteins essential for a functional PAR metabolism, although it is not known whether PAR metabolism is truly functional in bacteria.

In particular, we focus on the participation of both NAD-consuming enzymes (DNA ligase, mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase, sirtuins, and RNA 2\u2032-phosphotransferase) and NAD biosynthetic enzymes (both de novo, and recycling enzymes) in the response to DNA/RNA damage. As further supporting evidence for such a link, a genomic context analysis is presented showing several conserved associations between NAD homeostasis and stress responsive genes.",

These processes consume and produce both oxidative and reduced forms of NAD (NAD+ and NADH). NAD+ is also important for ADP(ribosyl)ation reactions mediated by the ADP-ribosyltransferase enzymes (ARTDs) or deacetylation reactions catalyzed by the sirtuins (SIRTs) which use NAD+ as a substrate. In this review, we highlight the significance of NAD+ catabolism in DNA repair and cell death through its utilization by ARTDs and SIRTs. We summarize the current findings on the involvement of ARTD1 activity in DNA repair and most specifically its involvement in the trigger of cell death mediated by ARTD1 activation and energy depletion. By sharing the same substrate, the activities of ARTDs and SIRTs are tightly linked, are dependent on each other and are thereby involved in the same cellular processes that play an important role in cancer biology, inflammatory diseases and ischaemia/reperfusion.",

The acetylation reaction is catalyzed by alpha-tubulin N-acetyltransferase and the modification can be reversed by either the NAD-independent class II histone deacetylase HDAC6 or the NAD-dependent deacetylase SIRT2. In this study, we assessed to what extent cellular NAD levels are involved in the regulation of the \u03b1-tubulin acetylation state. Cells were subjected to different treatments known to influence cellular NAD content. In response to NAD depletion caused by inhibition of NAD synthesis from nicotinamide, \u03b1-tubulin was hyperacetylated. Under these conditions, the normal tubulin acetylation state could be restored by providing the cells with alternative NAD precursors. Likewise, decreasing the rate of endogenous NAD consumption using an inhibitor of poly-ADP-ribosylation also stabilized the acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin. Conversely, the level of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin decreased when NAD synthesis was enhanced by overexpression of an NAD biosynthetic enzyme. Combined, these results show that the tubulin acetylation status is reciprocally regulated by cellular NAD levels. Furthermore, we provide evidence confirming that the NAD-dependent regulation of tubulin acetylation is mediated by SIRT2.",

     "abstract": "NAD is not only an important cofactor in redox reactions but has also received attention in recent years because of its physiological importance in metabolic regulation, DNA repair and signaling. In contrast to the redox reactions, these regulatory processes involve degradation of NAD and therefore necessitate a constant replenishment of its cellular pool. NAD biosynthetic enzymes are common to almost all species in all clades, but the number of NAD degrading enzymes varies substantially across taxa. In particular, vertebrates, including humans, have a manifold of NAD degrading enzymes which require a high turnover of NAD. As there is currently a lack of a systematic study of how natural selection has shaped enzymes involved in NAD metabolism we conducted a comprehensive evolutionary analysis based on intraspecific variation and interspecific divergence. We compare NAD biosynthetic and degrading enzymes in four eukaryotic model species and subsequently focus on human NAD metabolic enzymes and their orthologs in other vertebrates. We find that the majority of enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are subject to varying levels of purifying selection. While NAD biosynthetic enzymes appear to experience a rather high level of evolutionary constraint, there is evidence for positive selection among enzymes mediating NAD-dependent signaling. This is particularly evident for members of the PARP family, a diverse protein family involved in DNA damage repair and programmed cell death. Based on haplotype information and substitution rate analysis we pinpoint sites that are potential targets of positive selection. We also link our findings to a three dimensional structure, which suggests that positive selection occurs in domains responsible for DNA binding and polymerization rather than the NAD catalytic domain. Taken together, our results indicate that vertebrate NAD metabolism is still undergoing functional diversification.",

     "abstract": "Pyridine nucleotides are essential coenzymes in many cellular redox reactions in all living systems. In addition to functioning as a redox carrier, NAD+ is also a required co-substrate for the conserved sirtuin deacetylases. Sirtuins regulate transcription, genome maintenance and metabolism and function as molecular links between cells and their environment. Maintaining NAD+ homeostasis is essential for proper cellular function and aberrant NAD+ metabolism has been implicated in a number of metabolic- and age-associated diseases. Recently, NAD+ metabolism has been linked to the phosphate-responsive signaling pathway (PHO pathway) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Activation of the PHO pathway is associated with the production and mobilization of the NAD+ metabolite nicotinamide riboside (NR), which is mediated in part by PHO-regulated nucleotidases. Cross-regulation between NAD+ metabolism and the PHO pathway has also been reported; however, detailed mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The PHO pathway also appears to modulate the activities of common downstream effectors of multiple nutrient-sensing pathways (Ras-PKA, TOR, Sch9/AKT). These signaling pathways were suggested to play a role in calorie restriction-mediated beneficial effects, which have also been linked to Sir2 function and NAD+ metabolism. Here, we discuss the interactions of these pathways and their potential roles in regulating NAD+ metabolism. In eukaryotic cells, intracellular compartmentalization facilitates the regulation of enzymatic functions and also concentrates or sequesters specific metabolites. Various NAD+-mediated cellular functions such as mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation are compartmentalized. Therefore, we also discuss several key players functioning in mitochondrial, cytosolic and vacuolar compartmentalization of NAD+ intermediates, and their potential roles in NAD+ homeostasis. To date, it remains unclear how NAD+ and NAD+ intermediates shuttle between different cellular compartments. Together, these studies provide a molecular basis for how NAD+ homeostasis factors and the interacting signaling pathways confer metabolic flexibility and contribute to maintaining cell fitness and genome stability.",

     "abstract": "Human skin is exposed to daily environmental insults, particularly solar radiation, that triggers a range of molecular responses. These perturbations to the normal homeostatic state can lead to cellular dysfunction and, ultimately, impacts tissue integrity and accelerates skin aging (photoaging). One of the responses is increased oxidative stress which has been shown to disrupt cellular bioenergetics. This can be detected by depletion of the nucleotide energy metabolites NAD+ and ATP as both an acute transient decrease and, over time, a more permanent chronic reduction due in part to cumulative damage of mitochondria. NAD+ and its primary precursor nicotinamide have been known for some time to impact skin homeostasis based on linkages to dietary requirements, treatment of various inflammatory conditions, photoaging, and prevention of cancer. Cellular NAD+ pools are known to be lower in aged skin and treatment with nicotinamide is hypothesized to restore these levels, thereby mitigating cellular bioenergetics dysfunction. In dermal fibroblasts, nicotinamide is able to protect against oxidative stress to glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation as well as increase mitochondrial efficiency via sirtuin-dependent selective mitophagy. Recent research has found that NAD+ cellular pools are more dynamic than previously thought, oscillating in tandem with free nicotinamide, and serves as a regulatory point and feedback loop in cellular metabolism regulation, maintenance of mitochondrial efficiency, and circadian rhythmicity. Since UV-induced oxidative stress in skin can disrupt these processes, continued molecular understanding of the role of NAD+ and nicotinamide in skin biology is important to identify interventions that would help maintain its normal homeostatic functions and efficient cellular bioenergetics.",

Each spontaneous diastolic Ca2+ transient was exactly mirrored by a decrease of [Ca2+]SR. Since antagonism of the Ca2+ mobilizing second messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) was shown to block SCTs in single cardiac myocytes [28], we analyzed the effect of the novel ADP-ribosyl cyclase inhibitor SAN4825 on both cytosolic and intra-luminal Ca2+ transients upon strong \u03b2-adrenergic stimulation.

     "abstract": "NAD+ metabolism is an essential regulator of cellular redox reactions, energy pathways, and a substrate provider for NAD+ consuming enzymes. We recently demonstrated that enhancement of NAD+/NADH levels in breast cancer cells with impaired mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity, through augmentation of complex I or by supplementing tumor cell nutrients with NAD+ precursors, inhibits tumorigenicity and metastasis. To more fully understand how aberrantly low NAD+ levels promote tumor cell dissemination, we here asked whether inhibition of NAD+ salvage pathway activity by reduction in nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) expression can impact metastasis and tumor cell adhesive functions. We show that knockdown of NAMPT, the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step of the NAD+ salvage pathway, enhances metastatic aggressiveness in human breast cancer cells and involves modulation of integrin expression and function. Reduction in NAMPT expression is associated with upregulation of select adhesion receptors, particularly \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b21 integrins, and results in increased breast cancer cell attachment to extracellular matrix proteins, a key function in tumor cell dissemination. Interestingly, NAMPT downregulation prompts expression of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 in a high affinity conformation, known to promote tumor cell adhesive interactions during hematogenous metastasis. NAMPT has been selected as a therapeutic target for cancer therapy based on the essential functions of this enzyme in NAD+ metabolism, cellular redox, DNA repair and energy pathways. Notably, our results indicate that incomplete inhibition of NAMPT, which impedes NAD+ metabolism but does not kill a tumor cell can alter its phenotype to be more aggressive and metastatic. This phenomenon could promote cancer recurrence, even if NAMPT inhibition initially reduces tumor growth.",

The ADP-ribose transfer reactions are divided into mono- and poly-(ADP-ribosyl)ation. Cellular ADP-ribosylation levels are tightly regulated by enzymes that transfer ADP-ribose to acceptor proteins (e.g., ADP-ribosyltransferases, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP)) and those that cleave the linkage between ADP-ribose and acceptor (e.g., ADP-ribosyl-acceptor hydrolases (ARH), poly-(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases (PARG)), thereby constituting an ADP-ribosylation cycle. This review summarizes current findings related to the ARH family of proteins. This family comprises three members (ARH1-3) with similar size (39\u00a0kDa) and amino acid sequence. ARH1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond of mono-(ADP-ribosyl)ated arginine. ARH3 hydrolyzes poly-(ADP-ribose) (PAR) and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The different substrate specificities of ARH1 and ARH3 contribute to their unique roles in the cell. Based on a phenotype analysis of ARH1\u2212/\u2212 and ARH3\u2212/\u2212 mice, ARH1 is involved in the action by bacterial toxins as well as in tumorigenesis.

The chemical properties of this analog are comparable to those of \u03b2-NAD+ with a redox potential of \u2212324\u00a0mV and a 341\u00a0nm \u03bbmax for the reduced form. Both yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH) and horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (HLADH) catalyze the reduction of acycloNAD+ by primary alcohols. With HLADH 1-butanol has the highest Vmax at 49% that of \u03b2-NAD+. The primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect is greater than 3 indicating a significant contribution to the rate limiting step from cleavage of the carbon\u2013hydrogen bond. The stereochemistry of the hydride transfer in the oxidation of stereospecifically deuterium labeled n-butanol is identical to that for the reaction with \u03b2-NAD+. In contrast to the activity toward primary alcohols there is no detectable reduction of acycloNAD+ by secondary alcohols with HLADH although these alcohols serve as competitive inhibitors. The net effect is that acycloNAD+ has converted horse liver ADH from a broad spectrum alcohol dehydrogenase, capable of utilizing either primary or secondary alcohols, into an exclusively primary alcohol dehydrogenase. This is the first example of an NAD analog that alters the substrate specificity of a dehydrogenase and, like site-directed mutagenesis of proteins, establishes that modifications of the coenzyme distance from the active site can be used to alter enzyme function and substrate specificity. These and other results, including the activity with \u03b1-NADH, clearly demonstrate the promiscuity of the binding interactions between dehydrogenases and the riboside phosphate of the nicotinamide moiety, thus greatly expanding the possibilities for the design of analogs and inhibitors of specific dehydrogenases.",

LPO products react with cellular proteins changing their properties, and with DNA bases to form mutagenic etheno-DNA adducts, removed from DNA mainly by the base excision repair (BER) pathway.One of the major reactive aldehydes generated by LPO is 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). We investigated the effect of HNE on BER enzymes in human cells and in vitro. K21 cells pretreated with physiological HNE concentrations were more sensitive to oxidative and alkylating agents, H2O2 and MMS, than were untreated cells. Detailed examination of the effects of HNE on particular stages of BER in K21 cells revealed that HNE decreases the rate of excision of 1,N6-ethenoadenine (\u025bA) and 3,N4-ethenocytosine (\u025bC), but not of 8-oxoguanine. Simultaneously HNE increased the rate of AP-site incision and blocked the re-ligation step after the gap-filling by DNA polymerases. This suggested that HNE increases the number of unrepaired single-strand breaks (SSBs) in cells treated with oxidizing or methylating agents. Indeed, preincubation of cells with HNE and their subsequent treatment with H2O2 or MMS increased the number of nuclear poly(ADP-ribose) foci, known to appear in cells in response to SSBs. However, when purified BER enzymes were exposed to HNE, only ANPG and TDG glycosylases excising \u025bA and \u025bC from DNA were inhibited, and only at high HNE concentrations.

     "abstract": "Gene targeting is extremely efficient in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is performed by transformation with a linear, non-replicative DNA fragment carrying a selectable marker and containing ends homologous to the particular locus in a genome. However, even in S. cerevisiae, transformation can result in unwanted (aberrant) integration events, the frequency and spectra of which are quite different for ends-out and ends-in transformation assays. It has been observed that gene replacement (ends-out gene targeting) can result in illegitimate integration, integration of the transforming DNA fragment next to the target sequence and duplication of a targeted chromosome. By contrast, plasmid integration (ends-in gene targeting) is often associated with multiple targeted integration events but illegitimate integration is extremely rare and a targeted chromosome duplication has not been reported. Here we systematically investigated the influence of design of the ends-out assay on the success of targeted genetic modification. We have determined transformation efficiency, fidelity of gene targeting and spectra of all aberrant events in several ends-out gene targeting assays designed to insert, delete or replace a particular sequence in the targeted region of the yeast genome. Furthermore, we have demonstrated for the first time that targeted chromosome duplications occur even during ends-in gene targeting. Most importantly, the whole chromosome duplication is POL32 dependent pointing to break-induced replication (BIR) as the underlying mechanism. Moreover, the occurrence of duplication of the targeted chromosome was strikingly increased in the exo1\u0394 sgs1\u0394 double mutant but not in the respective single mutants demonstrating that the Exo1 and Sgs1 proteins independently suppress whole chromosome duplication during gene targeting.",

Identification of labeled proteins was achieved by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry peptide mass fingerprinting and genetic analysis. In wild-type extract, one of the components of the Ddc1-Rad17-Mec3 complex, Ddc1, was found to be preferentially photocrosslinked at a 3\u2032-junction. On the other hand, RPAp70, the large subunit of the replication protein A (RPA), was the predominant crosslinking product at a 5\u2032-junction. Interestingly, ddc1\u0394 extracts did not display photocrosslinking of RPAp70 at a 5\u2032-junction. The results show that RPAp70 crosslinked to DNA with a 5\u2032-junction is subject to limited proteolysis in ddc1\u0394 extracts, whereas it is stable in WT, rad17\u0394, mec3\u0394 and mec1\u0394 extracts. The degradation of the RPAp70-DNA adduct in ddc1\u0394 extract is strongly reduced in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor MG 132. We also addressed the question of the stability of free RPA, using anti-RPA antibodies. The results show that RPAp70 is also subject to proteolysis without photocrosslinking to DNA upon incubation in ddc1\u0394 extract. The data point to a novel property of Ddc1, modulating the turnover of DNA binding proteins such as RPAp70 by the proteasome.",

     "abstract": "The X-family DNA polymerases \u03bb (Pol\u03bb) and \u03b2 (Pol\u03b2) possess similar 5\u2032-2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate lyase (dRPase) and polymerase domains. Besides these domains, Pol\u03bb also possesses a BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain and a proline-rich domain at its N terminus. However, it is unclear how these non-enzymatic domains contribute to the unique biological functions of Pol\u03bb. Here, we used primer extension assays and a newly developed high-throughput short oligonucleotide sequencing assay (HT-SOSA) to compare the efficiency of lesion bypass and fidelity of human Pol\u03b2, Pol\u03bb and two N-terminal deletion constructs of Pol\u03bb during the bypass of either an abasic site or an 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) lesion. We demonstrate that the BRCT domain of Pol\u03bb enhances the efficiency of abasic site bypass by approximately 1.6-fold. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal domains of Pol\u03bb did not affect the efficiency of 8-oxodG bypass relative to nucleotide incorporations opposite undamaged dG. HT-SOSA analysis demonstrated that Pol\u03bb and Pol\u03b2 preferentially generated \u22121 or \u22122 frameshift mutations when bypassing an abasic site and the single or double base deletion frequency was highly sequence dependent. Interestingly, the BRCT and proline-rich domains of Pol\u03bb cooperatively promoted the generation of \u22122 frameshift mutations when the abasic site was situated within a sequence context that was susceptible to homology-driven primer realignment. Furthermore, both N-terminal domains of Pol\u03bb increased the generation of \u22121 frameshift mutations during 8-oxodG bypass and influenced the frequency of substitution mutations produced by Pol\u03bb opposite the 8-oxodG lesion. Overall, our data support a model wherein the BRCT and proline-rich domains of Pol\u03bb act cooperatively to promote primer/template realignment between DNA strands of limited sequence homology. This function of the N-terminal domains may facilitate the role of Pol\u03bb as a gap-filling polymerase within the non-homologous end joining pathway.",

     "abstract": "Human APE1 is an essential enzyme performing functions in DNA repair and transcription. It possesses four distinct repair activities acting on a variety of base and sugar derived DNA lesions. APE1 has seven cysteine residues and Cys65, and to a lesser extent Cys93 and Cys99, is uniquely involved in maintaining a subset of transcription factors in the reduced and active state. Four of the cysteines Cys93, 99, 208 and 310 of APE1 are located proximal to its active site residues Glu96, Asp210 and His309 involved in processing damaged DNA, raising the possibility that missense mutation of these cysteines could alter the enzyme DNA repair functions. An earlier report documented that serine substitution of the individual cysteine residues did not affect APE1 ability to cleave an abasic site oligonucleotide substrate in vitro, except for Cys99Ser, although any consequences of these variants in the repair of in vivo DNA lesions were not tested. Herein, we mutated all seven cysteines of APE1, either singly or in combination, to alanine and show that none of the resulting variants interfered with the enzyme DNA repair functions. Cross-specie complementation analysis reveals that these APE1 cysteine variants fully rescued the yeast DNA repair deficient strain YW778, lacking AP endonucleases and 3\u2032-diesterases, from toxicities caused by DNA damaging agents. Moreover, the elevated spontaneous mutations arising in strain YW778 from the lack of the DNA repair activities were completely suppressed by the APE1 cysteine variants. These findings suggest that the cysteine residues of APE1 are unlikely to play a role in the DNA repair functions of the enzyme in vivo. We also examine other APE1 missense mutations and provide the first evidence that the variant Asp308Ala with normal AP endonuclease, but devoid of 3\u02b9\u21925\u02b9 exonuclease, displays hypersensitivity to the anticancer drug bleomycin, and not to other agents, suggesting that it has a defect in processing unique DNA lesions. Molecular modeling reveals that Asp308Ala cannot make proper contact with Mg2+ and may alter the enzyme ability to cleave or disassociate from specific DNA lesions.",

Structural analysis of Pol \u03b9 revealed a narrow active site that promotes noncanonical base-pairing during catalysis. To better understand the structure-function relationships in the active site of Pol \u03b9 we investigated substitutions of individual amino acid residues in its fingers domain that contact either the templating or the incoming nucleotide. Two of the substitutions, Y39A and Q59A, significantly decreased the catalytic activity but improved the fidelity of Pol \u03b9. Surprisingly, in the presence of Mn2+ ions, the wild-type and mutant Pol \u03b9 variants efficiently incorporated nucleotides opposite template purines containing modifications that disrupted either Hoogsteen or Watson\u2013Crick base-pairing, suggesting that Pol \u03b9 may use various types of interactions during nucleotide addition. In contrast, in Mg2+ reactions, wild-type Pol \u03b9 was dependent on Hoogsteen base-pairing, the Y39A mutant was essentially inactive, and the Q59A mutant promoted Watson\u2013Crick interactions with template purines. The results suggest that Pol \u03b9 utilizes distinct mechanisms of nucleotide incorporation depending on the metal cofactor and reveal important roles of specific residues from the fingers domain in base-pairing and catalysis.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents a mechanistic model of base excision repair (BER) pathway for the repair of single-stand breaks (SSBs) and oxidized base lesions produced by ionizing radiation (IR). The model is based on law of mass action kinetics to translate the biochemical processes involved, step-by-step, in the BER pathway to translate into mathematical equations. The BER is divided into two subpathways, short-patch repair (SPR) and long-patch repair (LPR). SPR involves in replacement of single nucleotide via Pol \u03b2 and ligation of the ends via XRCC1 and Ligase III, while LPR involves in replacement of multiple nucleotides via PCNA, Pol \u03b4/\u025b and FEN 1, and ligation via Ligase I. A hallmark of IR is the production of closely spaced lesions within a turn of DNA helix (named complex lesions), which have been attributed to a slower repair process. The model presented considers fast and slow component of BER kinetics by assigning SPR for simple lesions and LPR for complex lesions. In the absence of in vivo reaction rate constants for the BER proteins, we have deduced a set of rate constants based on different published experimental measurements including accumulation kinetics obtained from UVA irradiation, overall SSB repair kinetic experiments, and overall BER kinetics from live-cell imaging experiments. The model was further used to calculate the repair kinetics of complex base lesions via the LPR subpathway and compared to foci kinetic experiments for cells irradiated with \u03b3 rays, Si, and Fe ions. The model calculation show good agreement with experimental measurements for both overall repair and repair of complex lesions. Furthermore, using the model we explored different mechanisms responsible for inhibition of repair when higher LET and HZE particles are used and concluded that increasing the damage complexity can inhibit initiation of LPR after the AP site removal step in BER.",

Here we were interested in comparing the biochemical properties of Brh2 fragments, Brh2NT and Brh2CT, respectively, harboring the two different DNA-binding regions to understand the mechanistic purpose of dual DNA-interaction domains. With oligonucleotide substrates to model different DNA conformations, it was found that the substrate specificity of Brh2NT and Brh2CT was almost indistinguishable although avidity was different depending on salt concentration. DNA annealing activity inherent in Brh2 was found to be attributable to Brh2NT. Likewise, activity responsible for a second-end capture reaction modeling a later step in repair of DNA double-strand breaks was found attributable to Brh2NT. Efficient annealing of DNA strands coated with RPA required full length Brh2 rather than Brh2NT suggesting Brh2CT contributes to the activity when RPA is present. Brh2NT and Brh2CT were both found capable of physically interacting with RPA. The results suggest that while the two DNA-binding regions of Brh2 appear functionally redundant in certain aspects of DNA repair, they differ in fundamental properties, and likely contribute in different ways to repair processes involving or arising from stalled DNA replication forks.",

We constructed pol\u03b7-deficient mice transgenic with lacZ mutational reporter genes to study the effect of Polh null mutation (Polh\u2212/\u2212) on mutagenesis in the skin after UVB irradiation. UVB induced lacZ mutations with remarkably higher frequency in the Polh\u2212/\u2212 epidermis and dermis than in the wild-type (Polh+/+) and heterozygote. DNA sequences of a hundred lacZ mutants isolated from the epidermis of four UVB-exposed Polh\u2212/\u2212 mice were determined and compared with mutant sequences from irradiated Polh+/+ mice. The spectra of the mutations in the two genotypes were both highly UV-specific and dominated by C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T transitions at dipyrimidines, namely UV-signature mutations. However, sequence preferences of the occurrence of UV-signature mutations were quite different between the two genotypes: the mutations occurred at a higher frequency preferentially at the 5\u2032-TCG-3\u2032 sequence context than at the other dipyrimidine contexts in the Polh+/+ epidermis, whereas the mutations were induced remarkably and exclusively at the 3\u2032-cytosine of almost all dipyrimidine contexts with no preference for 5\u2032-TCG-3\u2032 in the Polh\u2212/\u2212 epidermis. In addition, in Polh\u2212/\u2212 mice, a small but remarkable fraction of G\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T transversions was also observed exclusively at the 3\u2032-cytosine of dipyrimidine sites, strongly suggesting that these transversions resulted not from oxidative damage but from UV photolesions. These results would reflect the characteristics of the error-prone TLS functioning in the bypass of UV photolesions in the absence of pol\u03b7, which would be mediated by mechanisms based on the two-step model of TLS. On the other hand, the deamination model would explain well the mutation spectrum in the Polh+/+ genotype.",

     "abstract": "BLM and WRN are members of the RecQ family of DNA helicases that act to suppress genome instability and cancer predisposition. In addition to a RecQ helicase domain, each of these proteins contains an N-terminal domain of approximately 500 amino acids (aa) that is incompletely characterized. Previously, we showed that the N-terminus of Sgs1, the yeast ortholog of BLM, contains a physiologically important 200 aa domain (Sgs1103\u2013322) that displays single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding, strand annealing (SA), and apparent strand-exchange (SE) activities in vitro. Here we used a genetic assay to search for heterologous proteins that could functionally replace this domain of Sgs1 in vivo. In contrast to Rad59, the oligomeric Rad52 protein provided in vivo complementation, suggesting that multimerization is functionally important. An N-terminal domain of WRN was also identified that could replace Sgs1103\u2013322 in yeast. This domain, WRN235\u2013526, contains a known coiled coil and displays the same SA and SE activities as Sgs1103\u2013322. The coiled coil domain of WRN235\u2013526 is required for both its in vivo activity and its in vitro SE activity. Based on this result, a potential coiled coil was identified within Sgs1103\u2013322. This 25 amino acid region was similarly essential for wt Sgs1 activity in vivo and was replaceable by a heterologous coiled coil. Taken together, the results indicate that a coiled coil and a closely linked apparent SE activity are conserved features of the BLM and WRN DNA helicases.",

To measure the correct or mutagenic outcome of lesion bypass, an original quantitative pyrosequencing method was developed and analytically validated. The method was applied to the study of DNA synthesis fidelity through an 8-oxodG or an undamaged guanine. After an in vitro primer-extension through 8-oxodG in the presence of the four deoxynucleotides triphosphates and a total nuclear protein extract, obtained from normal human intestinal epithelial cells (FHs 74 Int cell line), the reaction products were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed by pyrosequencing to measure nucleotides inserted opposite the lesion. The 8-oxodG bypass fidelity of FHs 74 Int cells nuclear extract is about 85.3%. We calculated within-day and total precisions for both 8-oxodG (2.8% and 2.8%, respectively) and undamaged templates (1.0% and 1.1%, respectively). We also demonstrated that only cytosine is incorporated opposite a normal guanine and that both cytosine and adenine can be incorporated opposite an 8-oxodG lesion.

     "abstract": "Transient induction or suppression of target genes is useful to study the function of toxic or essential genes in cells. Here we apply a Tet-On 3G system to DT40 lymphoma B cell lines, validating it for three different genes. Using this tool, we then show that overexpression of the chicken BRC4 repeat of the tumor suppressor BRCA2 impairs cell proliferation and induces chromosomal breaks. Mechanistically, high levels of BRC4 suppress double strand break-induced homologous recombination, inhibit the formation of RAD51 recombination repair foci, reduce cellular resistance to DNA damaging agents and induce a G2 damage checkpoint-mediated cell-cycle arrest. The above phenotypes are mediated by BRC4 capability to bind and inhibit RAD51. The toxicity associated with BRC4 overexpression is exacerbated by chemotherapeutic agents and reversed by RAD51 overexpression, but it is neither aggravated nor suppressed by a deficit in the non-homologous end-joining pathway of double strand break repair. We further find that the endogenous BRCA2 mediates the cytotoxicity associated with BRC4 induction, thus underscoring the possibility that BRC4 or other domains of BRCA2 cooperate with ectopic BRC4 in regulating repair activities or mitotic cell division. In all, the results demonstrate the utility of the Tet-On 3G system in DT40 research and underpin a model in which BRC4 role on cell proliferation and chromosome repair arises primarily from its suppressive role on RAD51 functions.",

In order to investigate the intrinsic mutagenic potential of N7-alkylguanine adducts, we prepared single-stranded DNA probes containing a single well-defined N7-alkylguanine adduct under conditions that minimize the presence of depurinated molecules. Following introduction of these probes into Escherichia coli cells, the effect of the N7-alkylguanine adducts on the efficiency and fidelity of replication was determined. To investigate the effect on replication we monitored the relative transformation efficiency of the lesion containing constructs with respect to the control construct. The methyl adduct was found not to be toxic, while the N7-(2-hydroxyethyl)guanine (N7-heG) and N7-(2-hydroxypropyl)guanine (N7-hpG) adducts reduce the transformation efficiency to \u224870% and 40%, respectively. Within the detection limits of our assay, replication across the N7-alkylguanine adducts in vivo is essentially error-free, as no mutant colony was observed among \u2248300 individual sequenced colonies (i.e., mutation frequency\u00a0<\u00a00.3%).",

Many intracellular proteins are involved in the activation or inhibition of Akt signaling and the hyperactivation of Akt signaling pathway is found to be frequently involved in various types of human cancers. Furthermore, while p53R2, a p53-inducible peptide involved in the synthesis of dNTPs normally works toward suppression of cancer through elimination of reactive oxygen species (ROS), inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway and providing dNTPs for DNA repair, the overexpression of p53R2 is reported to be associated with cancer progression and resistance to therapy. In this review article, we will discuss the situation in which cancer cells with hyperactive PI3K/Akt signaling can recruit p53R2 in favor of cancer progression and resistance to therapy. In the hyperactive state of PI3K/Akt signaling (which happens in the absence of deactivation or excess of activation), p53R2 can be used by cancer cells to promote proliferation. Therefore, the hyperactivity of PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated levels of p53R2 can give rise to highly invasive cancers.",

     "abstract": "RecQ-like helicases are a highly conserved family of proteins which are critical for preserving genome integrity. Genome instability is considered a hallmark of cancer and mutations within three of the five human RECQ genes cause hereditary syndromes that are associated with cancer predisposition. The human RecQ-like helicase BLM has a central role in DNA damage signaling, repair, replication, and telomere maintenance. BLM and its budding yeast orthologue Sgs1 unwind double-stranded DNA intermediates. Intriguingly, BLM functions in both a pro- and anti-recombinogenic manner upon replicative damage, acting on similar substrates. Thus, BLM activity must be intricately controlled to prevent illegitimate recombination events that could have detrimental effects on genome integrity. In recent years it has become evident that post-translational modifications (PTMs) of BLM allow a fine-tuning of its function. To date, BLM phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and SUMOylation have been identified, in turn regulating its subcellular localization, protein\u2013protein interactions, and protein stability. In this review, we will discuss the cellular context of when and how these different modifications of BLM occur. We will reflect on the current model of how PTMs control BLM function during DNA damage repair and compare this to what is known about post-translational regulation of the budding yeast orthologue Sgs1. Finally, we will provide an outlook toward future research, in particular to dissect the cross-talk between the individual PTMs on BLM.",

While this interaction is known to be important for the activation of ATR-Chk1 pathway, how the interaction contributes to their accumulation at sites of DNA damage remains controversial. Here, we have studied the contribution of the 9\u20131\u20131/TopBP1 interaction to the assembly and activation of checkpoint proteins at damaged DNA. UV-irradiation enhanced association of Rad9 with chromatin and its localization to sites of DNA damage without a direct interaction with TopBP1. TopBP1, as well as RPA and Rad17 facilitated Rad9 recruitment to DNA damage sites. Similar to Rad9, TopBP1 also localized to sites of UV-induced DNA damage. The DNA damage-induced TopBP1 redistribution was delayed in cells expressing a TopBP1 binding-deficient Rad9 mutant. Pharmacological inhibition of ATR recapitulated the delayed accumulation of TopBP1 in the cells, suggesting that ATR activation will induce more efficient accumulation of TopBP1. Taken together, TopBP1 and Rad9 can be independently recruited to damaged DNA. Once recruited, a direct interaction of 9\u20131\u20131/TopBP1 occurs and induces ATR activation leading to further TopBP1 accumulation and amplification of the checkpoint signal. Thus, we propose a new positive feedback mechanism that is necessary for successful formation of the damage-sensing complex and DNA damage checkpoint signaling in human cells.",

Here we show that Uls1 is implicated in DNA repair independently of the replication stress response pathways mediated by the endonucleases Mus81 and Yen1 and the helicases Mph1 and Srs2. Uls1 works together with Sgs1 and we demonstrate that the attenuation of replication stress-related defects in sgs1\u0394 by deletion of ULS1 depends on a functional of Rad51 recombinase and post-replication repair pathway mediated by Rad18 and Rad5, but not on the translesion polymerase, Rev3. The higher resistance of sgs1\u0394 uls1\u0394 mutants to genotoxic stress compared to single sgs1\u0394 cells is not the result of decreased formation or accelerated resolution of recombination-dependent DNA structures. Instead, deletion of ULS1 restores stability of the rDNA region in sgs1\u0394 cells. Our data suggest that Uls1 may contribute to genomic stability during DNA synthesis and channel the repair of replication lesions into the Sgs1-dependent pathway, with DNA translocase and SUMO binding activities of Uls1 as well as a RING domain being essential for its functions in replication stress response.",

However, the mechanism(s) by which Ligase IV control the NHEJ reaction and other NHEJ factor(s) remains poorly characterized. Here, we show that a C-terminal region of Ligase IV (aa 620\u2013800), which encompasses a NLS, the BRCT I, and the XRCC4 interacting region (XIR), is essential for nuclear localization of its co-factor XRCC4. In Ligase IV deficient cells, XRCC4 showed deregulated localization remaining in the cytosol even after induction of DNA double strand breaks. DNA Ligase IV was also required for efficient localization of XLF into the nucleus. Additionally, human fibroblasts that harbor hypomorphic mutations within the Ligase IV gene displayed decreased levels of XRCC4 protein, implicating that DNA Ligase IV is also regulating XRCC4 stability. Our results provide evidence for a role of DNA Ligase IV in controlling the cellular localization and protein levels of XRCC4.",

Previous structural and biochemical studies showed that the conserved Asn-212 residue is important for the enzymatic activity of APE1. Here, we report a comprehensive pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of two APE1 mutants, each containing amino acid substitutions at position 212, to ascertain the role of Asn-212 in individual steps of the APE1 catalytic mechanism. We applied the stopped-flow technique for detection of conformational transitions in the mutant proteins and DNA substrates during the catalytic cycle, using fluorophores that are sensitive to the micro-environment. Our data indicate that Asn-212 substitution by Asp reduces the rate of the incision step by \u223c550-fold, while Ala substitution results in \u223c70,000-fold decrease. Analysis of the binding steps revealed that both mutants continued to rapidly and efficiently bind to abasic DNA containing the natural AP site or its tetrahydrofuran analogue (F). Moreover, transient kinetic analysis showed that N212A APE1 possessed a higher binding rate and a higher affinity for specific substrates compared to N212D APE1. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation revealed a significant dislocation of the key catalytic residues of both mutant proteins relative to wild-type APE1. The analysis of the model structure of N212D APE1 provides evidence for alternate hydrogen bonding between Asn-212 and Asp-210 residues, whereas N212A possesses an extended active site pocket due to Asn removal. Taken together, these biochemical and MD simulation results indicate that Asn-212 is essential for abasic DNA incision, but is not crucial for effective recognition/binding.",

In hematopoiesis, loss of MMR results in methylating agent resistance and a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) repopulation defect.

We focus on the 5\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a03\u2032 exonuclease Exo1, the primary enzyme excising the nicked strand during MMR, preceding polymerase synthesis. We found that nuclease dead Exo1 mutant cells are sensitive to the O6-methylguanine alkylating agent temozolomide when given with the MGMT inactivator, O6benzylguanine (BG). Additionally we used an MMR reporter plasmid to verify that Exo1mut MEFs were able to repair G:T base mismatches in vitro. We showed that unlike other MMR deficient mouse models, Exo1mut mouse HSC did not gain a competitive survival advantage post temozolomide/BG treatment in vivo. To determine potential nucleases implicated in MMR in the absence of Exo1 nuclease activity, but in the presence of the inactive protein, we performed gene expression analyses of several mammalian nucleases in WT and Exo1mut MEFs before and after temozolomide treatment and identified upregulation of Artemis, Fan1, and Mre11. Partial shRNA mediated silencing of each of these in Exo1mut cells resulted in decreased MMR capacity and increased resistance to temozolomide/BG. We propose that nuclease function is required for fully functional MMR, but a portfolio of nucleases is able to compensate for loss of Exo1 nuclease activity to maintain proficiency.",

One of the three major adducts identified is N-(2\u2032-deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-3-aminobenzanthrone (dGC8-N-ABA). This bulky adduct likely stalls replicative DNA polymerases but can be traversed by lesion bypass polymerases in vivo. Here, we employed running start assays to show that a site-specifically placed dGC8-N-ABA is bypassed in vitro by Sulfolobus solfataricus DNA polymerase IV (Dpo4), a model Y-family DNA polymerase. However, the nucleotide incorporation rate of Dpo4 was significantly reduced opposite both the lesion and the template position immediately downstream from the lesion site, leading to two strong pause sites. To investigate the kinetic effect of dGC8-N-ABA on polymerization, we utilized pre-steady-state kinetic methods to determine the kinetic parameters for individual nucleotide incorporations upstream, opposite, and downstream from the dGC8-N-ABA lesion. Relative to the replication of the corresponding undamaged DNA template, both nucleotide incorporation efficiency and fidelity of Dpo4 were considerably decreased during dGC8-N-ABA lesion bypass and the subsequent extension step. The lower nucleotide incorporation efficiency caused by the lesion is a result of a significantly reduced dNTP incorporation rate constant and modestly weaker dNTP binding affinity. At both pause sites, nucleotide incorporation followed biphasic kinetics with a fast and a slow phase and their rates varied with nucleotide concentration. In contrast, only the fast phase was observed with undamaged DNA. A kinetic mechanism was proposed for the bypass of dGC8-N-ABA bypass catalyzed by Dpo4.",

We also uncovered important genetic interactions between Aag, which excises a wide variety of damaged DNA bases, and the DNA damage sensor and signaling protein, Atm. We show that Atm plays a role in mediating survival in the face of both spontaneous and induced DNA damage, and that Aag deficiency not only promotes overall survival, but also alters the tumor spectrum in Atm\u2212/\u2212 mice. Further, the reversal of spontaneous alkylation damage by Mgmt interacts with the DNA mismatch repair pathway to modulate survival and tumor spectrum.

The interstrand DNA crosslinks are complex double strand lesions that require the involvement of multiple pathways for repair. Homologous recombination, which can carry out error-free repair, is a major pathway for crosslink repair; however, some recombination pathways can also produce DNA rearrangements. Psoralen photoreaction-induced recombination in yeast was measured using direct repeat substrates that can detect gene conversions, a form of conservative recombination, as well as deletions and triplications, which generate gene copy number changes. In repair-proficient cells the major products of recombination were gene conversions, along with substantial fractions of deletions. Deficiencies in DNA repair pathways increased non-conservative recombination products. Homologous recombination-deficient rad51, rad54, and rad57 strains had low levels of crosslink-induced recombination, and most products were deletions produced by single strand annealing. Nucleotide excision repair-deficient rad1 and rad2 yeast had increased levels of triplications, and rad1 cells had lower crosslink-induced recombination. Deficiencies in post-replication repair increased crosslink-induced recombination and gene copy number changes.

Recently, an additional EJing repair pathway (A-NHEJ; alternative-NHEJ) has been described. Currently, the mechanism of A-NHEJ is obscure although a dependency on LIGIII (DNA ligase III) is often implicated. To test the requirement for LIGIII in A-NHEJ we constructed a LIGIII conditionally-null human cell line using gene targeting. Nuclear EJing activity appeared unaffected by a deficiency in LIGIII as, surprisingly, so were random gene targeting integration events. In contrast, LIGIII was required for mitochondrial function and this defined the gene's essential activity. Human Ku:LIGIII and Ku:LIGIV (DNA ligase IV) double knockout cell lines, however, demonstrated that LIGIII is required for the enhanced A-NHEJ activity that is observed in Ku-deficient cells. Most unexpectedly, however, the majority of EJing events remained LIGIV-dependent. In conclusion, although human LIGIII has an essential function in mitochondrial maintenance, it is dispensable for most types of nuclear DSB repair, except for the A-NHEJ events that are normally suppressed by Ku. Moreover, we describe that a robust Ku-independent, LIGIV-dependent repair pathway exists in human somatic cells.",

The C-terminal small mutS-related (Smr) domain is critical for its endonucleolytic activity. However, the detailed catalytic mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we first investigated the in vivo role of drMutS2 in Deinococcus radiodurans, the most radiation-resistant organism exhibits the remarkable DNA repair capacity. mutS2 and recA mutS2 double knockout mutants were constructed because the phenotype was strongly masked by the predominant homologous recombination DNA repair pathway in this bacterium. Compared with the recA mutant, cells devoid of both genes showed increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and oxidative agents, suggesting that drMutS2 is involved in RecA-independent mechanisms that enhance cellular resistance to oxidative stress-induced DNA damage. Moreover, the basal level of reductase activity and thiamine biosynthesis was induced in the absence of mutS2. To characterize its catalytic residues, the Smr domain was crystallized and soaked in buffer containing manganese ions. In contrast to native crystals, the space group of manganese-derivative crystals transformed from monoclinic to orthorhombic unexpectedly. This type of crystals showed improved diffraction resolution to 1.2\u00a0\u00c5, which has the highest resolution of currently known Smr structures. Structural comparison revealed that three acidic amino-acid residues, which are all located in the \u03b11 helix, changed the rotamer states after metal soaking. Mutational analysis of conserved residue glutamic acid 710 to alanine yielded a drMutS2 variant with impaired nuclease activity, and could only partially rescue the radiosensitive phenotype of the mutS2 null strain, indicating that glutamic acid 710 is the catalytic residue.",

Site-specific DSBs were induced by SegC endonuclease in the rIIB gene of one of the parents. The frequency/distance relationship was determined in crosses of the wild-type phage, topoisomerase II mutant amN116 (gene 39), and primase mutant E219 (gene 61). Ordinary two-factor (i\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0j) and three-factor (i k\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0j) crosses between point rII mutations were also performed. These data provide information about the frequency and distance distribution of the single-exchange (splice) and double-exchange (patch) events. In two-factor crosses ets1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0i, the topoisomerase and primase mutants had similar recombinant frequencies in crosses at ets1\u2013i distances longer than 1000\u00a0bp, comprising about 80% of the corresponding wild-type values. They, however, differ remarkably in crosses at shorter distances. In the primase mutant, the recombinant frequencies are similar to those in the wild-type crosses at distances less than 100\u00a0bp, being a bit diminished at longer distances. In two-factor crosses ets1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0i of the topoisomerase mutant, the recombinant frequencies were reduced ten-fold at the shortest distances. In three-factor crosses a6 ets1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0i, where we measure patch-related recombination, the primase mutant was quite proficient across the entire range of distances. The topoisomerase mutant crosses demonstrated virtually complete absence of rII+ recombinants at distances up to 33\u00a0bp, with the frequencies increasing steadily at longer distances. The data were interpreted as follows. The primase mutant is fully recombination-proficient. An obvious difference from the wild-type state is some shortage of EndoVII function leading to prolonged existence of HJs and thus stretched out ds-branch migration. This is also true for the topoisomerase mutant. However, the latter is deficient in the ss-branch migration step of the DSB repair pathway and partially deficient in HJ initiation. In apparent contradiction to their effects on the DSB-induced site-specific recombination, the topoisomerase and primase mutants demonstrated about 3\u20138-fold increase in the recombinant frequencies in the ordinary crosses, with the recombination running exclusively via patches. This implies that most of the spontaneous recombination events are not initiated by dsDNA ends in these mutants.",

The DDR suppresses cancer by promoting genome stability, and it regulates tumor resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy. Three members of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK, are important DDR proteins. A key PIKK target is replication protein A (RPA), which binds single-stranded DNA and functions in DNA replication, DNA repair, and checkpoint signaling. An early response to replication stress is ATR activation, which occurs when RPA accumulates on ssDNA. Activated ATR phosphorylates many targets, including the RPA32 subunit of RPA, leading to Chk1 activation and replication arrest. DNA-PK also phosphorylates RPA32 in response to replication stress, and we demonstrate that cells with DNA-PK defects, or lacking RPA32 Ser4/Ser8 targeted by DNA-PK, confer similar phenotypes, including defective replication checkpoint arrest, hyper-recombination, premature replication fork restart, failure to block late origin firing, and increased mitotic catastrophe. We present evidence that hyper-recombination in these mutants is ATM-dependent, but the other defects are ATM-independent. These results indicate that DNA-PK and ATR signaling through RPA32 plays a critical role in promoting genome stability and cell survival in response to replication stress.",

Importantly, radiation therapy and most radiomimetic drugs have diminished effect in hypoxic environments due to decreased induction of DNA strand breaks, which is an oxygen requiring process. However, C-1027's induction of ICLs is enhanced under hypoxia and it is actually more potent against hypoxic cells, overcoming this common tumor resistance mechanism. In this study, an analog of C-1027, 20\u2032-deschloro-C-1027 was examined for its ability to induce DNA ICLs under hypoxic conditions. Deschloro-induced ICLs were detected under hypoxic cell-free conditions, with a concomitant reduction in the induction of DNA strand breaks. In cells deschloro behaved similarly, inducing cellular ICLs under hypoxic conditions with a reduction in DNA breaks. The cytotoxicity of deschloro treatment was similar in normoxic and hypoxic cells, suggesting that the ICL induction allows deschloro to retain its cytotoxic activity under hypoxia. It appears that rational engineering of the C-1027 family of radiomimetics holds promise toward overcoming the radioresistance associated with the hypoxic environment associated with solid tumors.",

These lesions are repaired by parallel repair pathways including the tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1)-related pathway and homologous recombination. As TDP1-deficient cells in vertebrates are hypersensitive to Top1 inhibitors, small molecules inhibiting TDP1 should augment the cytotoxicity of Top1 inhibitors. We developed a cell-based high-throughput screening assay for the discovery of inhibitors for human TDP1 using a TDP1-deficient chicken DT40 cell line (TDP1\u2212/\u2212) complemented with human TDP1 (hTDP1). Any compounds showing a synergistic effect with the Top1 inhibitor camptothecin (CPT) in hTDP1 cells should either be a TDP1-related pathway inhibitor or an inhibitor of alternate repair pathways for Top1cc. We screened the 400,000-compound Small Molecule Library Repository (SMLR, NIH Molecular Libraries) against hTDP1 cells in the absence or presence of CPT. After confirmation in a secondary screen using both hTDP1 and TDP1\u2212/\u2212 cells in the absence or presence of CPT, five compounds were confirmed as potential TDP1 pathway inhibitors. All five compounds showed synergistic effect with CPT in hTDP1 cells, but not in TDP1\u2212/\u2212 cells, indicating that the compounds inhibited a TDP1-related repair pathway. Yet, in vitro gel-based assay revealed that the five compounds did not inhibit TDP1 catalytic activity directly. We tested the compounds for their ability to inhibit poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) because PARP inhibitors are known to potentiate the cytotoxicity of CPT by inhibiting the recruitment of TDP1 to Top1cc. Accordingly, we found that the five compounds inhibit catalytic activity of PARP by ELISA and Western blotting. We identified the most potent compound (Cpd1) that offers characteristic close to veliparib, a leading clinical PARP inhibitor.

These enzymes share a unique structural feature, an auxiliary domain stabilized by an iron-sulphur (FeS) cluster, and a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 polarity of DNA translocation and duplex unwinding. Biochemical analyses alongside two single-molecule approaches, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and high-resolution optical tweezers, have shown how the unique structural features of XPD helicase and its specific patterns of substrate interactions tune the helicase for its specific cellular function and shape its molecular mechanism. The FeS domain forms a duplex separation wedge and contributes to an extended DNA binding site. Interactions within this site position the helicase in an orientation to unwind the duplex, control the helicase rate, and verify the integrity of the translocating strand. Consistent with its cellular role, processivity of XPD is limited and is defined by an idiosyncratic stepping kinetics. DNA duplex separation occurs in single base pair steps punctuated by frequent backward steps and conformational rearrangements of the protein\u2013DNA complex. As such, the helicase in isolation mainly stabilizes spontaneous base pair opening and exhibits a limited ability to unwind stable DNA duplexes. The presence of a cognate ssDNA binding protein converts XPD into a vigorous helicase by destabilizing the upstream dsDNA as well as by trapping the unwound strands. Remarkably, the two proteins can co-exist on the same DNA strand without competing for binding. The current model of the XPD unwinding mechanism will be discussed along with possible modifications to this mechanism by the helicase interacting partners and unique features of such bio-medically important XPD-like helicases as FANCJ (BACH1), RTEL1 and CHLR1 (DDX11).",

The same system of proteins plays key roles in many cancer related cellular transactions in humans. Although the basic process has been reconstituted in vitro using purified components, many fundamental aspects of DNA mismatch repair remain hidden due in part to the complexity and transient nature of the interactions between the mismatch repair proteins and DNA substrates. Single molecule methods offer the capability to uncover these transient but complex interactions and allow novel insights into mechanisms that underlie DNA mismatch repair. In this review, we discuss applications of single molecule methodology including electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, particle tracking, FRET, and optical trapping to studies of DNA mismatch repair.

     "abstract": "Base-pair mismatches that occur during DNA replication or recombination can reduce genetic stability or conversely increase genetic diversity. The genetics and biophysical mechanism of mismatch repair (MMR) has been extensively studied since its discovery nearly 50 years ago. MMR is a strand-specific excision-resynthesis reaction that is initiated by MutS homolog (MSH) binding to the mismatched nucleotides. The MSH mismatch-binding signal is then transmitted to the immediate downstream MutL homolog (MLH/PMS) MMR components and ultimately to a distant strand scission site where excision begins. The mechanism of signal transmission has been controversial for decades. We have utilized single molecule Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET), Fluorescence Tracking (smFT) and Polarization Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (smP-TIRF) to examine the interactions and dynamic behaviors of single Thermus aquaticus MutS (TaqMutS) particles on mismatched DNA. We determined that TaqMutS forms an incipient clamp to search for a mismatch in \u223c1\u00a0s intervals by 1-dimensional (1D) thermal fluctuation-driven rotational diffusion while in continuous contact with the helical duplex DNA. When MutS encounters a mismatch it lingers for \u223c3\u00a0s to exchange bound ADP for ATP (ADP\u00a0\u2192\u00a0ATP exchange). ATP binding by TaqMutS induces an extremely stable clamp conformation (\u223c10\u00a0min) that slides off the mismatch and moves along the adjacent duplex DNA driven simply by 1D thermal diffusion. The ATP-bound sliding clamps rotate freely while in discontinuous contact with the DNA. The visualization of a train of MSH proteins suggests that dissociation of ATP-bound sliding clamps from the mismatch permits multiple mismatch-dependent loading events. These direct observations have provided critical clues into understanding the molecular mechanism of MSH proteins during MMR.",

     "abstract": "A fundamental feature of many nucleic-acid binding proteins is their ability to move along DNA either by diffusion-based mechanisms or by ATP-hydrolysis driven translocation. For example, most site-specific DNA-binding proteins must diffuse to some extent along DNA to either find their target sites, or to otherwise fulfill their biological roles. Similarly, nucleic-acid translocases such as helicases and polymerases must move along DNA to fulfill their functions. In both instances, the proteins must also be capable of moving in crowded environments while navigating through DNA-bound obstacles. These types of behaviors can be challenging to analyze by bulk biochemical methods because of the transient nature of the interactions, and/or heterogeneity of the reaction intermediates. The advent of single-molecule methodologies has overcome some of these problems, and has led to many new insights into the mechanisms that contribute to protein motion along DNA. We have developed DNA curtains as a tool to facilitate single molecule observations of protein-nucleic acid interactions, and we have applied these new research tools to systems involving both diffusive-based motion as well as ATP directed translocation. Here we highlight these studies by first discussing how diffusion contributes to target searches by proteins involved in post-replicative mismatch repair. We then discuss DNA curtain assays of two different DNA translocases, RecBCD and FtsK, which participate in homologous DNA recombination and site-specific DNA recombination, respectively.",

Members of the type I topoisomerase family cleave a single strand of their double-stranded DNA substrate, whereas enzymes of the type II family cleave both DNA strands. Bacterial DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, catalyzes the introduction of negative supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. Gyrase is not present in humans, and constitutes an attractive drug target for the treatment of bacterial and parasite infections. DNA supercoiling by gyrase is believed to occur by a strand passage mechanism, in which one segment of the double-stranded DNA substrate is passed through a (transient) break in a second segment. This mechanism requires the coordinated opening and closing of three protein interfaces, so-called gates, to ensure the directionality of strand passage toward negative supercoiling.Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments are ideally suited to investigate conformational changes during the catalytic cycle of DNA topoisomerases. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the cascade of DNA- and nucleotide-induced conformational changes in gyrase that lead to strand passage and negative supercoiling of DNA. We discuss how these conformational changes couple ATP hydrolysis to DNA supercoiling in gyrase, and how the common mechanistic principle of coordinated gate opening and closing is modulated to allow for the catalysis of different reactions by different type II topoisomerases.",

In this review, we have focused on the endogenous exposome, the DNA damage that arises from the production of endogenous electrophilic molecules in our cells. It provides quantitative data on endogenous DNA damage and its relationship to mutagenesis, with emphasis on when exogenous chemical exposures that produce identical DNA adducts to those arising from normal metabolism cause significant increases in total identical DNA adducts. We have utilized stable isotope labeled chemical exposures of animals and cells, so that accurate relationships between endogenous and exogenous exposures can be determined. Advances in mass spectrometry have vastly increased both the sensitivity and accuracy of such studies.

     "abstract": "Genomic uracil is normally processed essentially error-free by base excision repair (BER), with mismatch repair (MMR) as an apparent backup for U:G mismatches. Nuclear uracil-DNA glycosylase UNG2 is the major enzyme initiating BER of uracil of U:A pairs as well as U:G mismatches. Deficiency in UNG2 results in several-fold increases in genomic uracil in mammalian cells. Thus, the alternative uracil-removing glycosylases, SMUG1, TDG and MBD4 cannot efficiently complement UNG2-deficiency. A major function of SMUG1 is probably to remove 5-hydroxymethyluracil from DNA with general back-up for UNG2 as a minor function. TDG and MBD4 remove deamination products U or T mismatched to G in CpG/mCpG contexts, but may have equally or more important functions in development, epigenetics and gene regulation. Genomic uracil was previously thought to arise only from spontaneous cytosine deamination and incorporation of dUMP, generating U:G mismatches and U:A pairs, respectively. However, the identification of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and other APOBEC family members as DNA-cytosine deaminases has spurred renewed interest in the processing of genomic uracil. Importantly, AID triggers the adaptive immune response involving error-prone processing of U:G mismatches, but also contributes to B-cell lymphomagenesis. Furthermore, mutational signatures in a substantial fraction of other human cancers are consistent with APOBEC-induced mutagenesis, with U:G mismatches as prime suspects. Mutations can be caused by replicative polymerases copying uracil in U:G mismatches, or by translesion polymerases that insert incorrect bases opposite abasic sites after uracil-removal. In addition, kataegis, localized hypermutations in one strand in the vicinity of genomic rearrangements, requires APOBEC protein, UNG2 and translesion polymerase REV1. What mechanisms govern error-free versus error prone processing of uracil in DNA remains unclear. In conclusion, genomic uracil is an essential intermediate in adaptive immunity and innate antiviral responses, but may also be a fundamental cause of a wide range of malignancies.",

     "abstract": "The first eukaryotic NER factor that recognizes NER substrates is the heterodimeric XPC-RAD23B protein. The currently accepted hypothesis is that this protein recognizes the distortions/destabilization caused by DNA lesions rather than the lesions themselves. The resulting XPC-RAD23B\u2013DNA complexes serve as scaffolds for the recruitment of subsequent NER factors that lead to the excision of the oligonucleotide sequences containing the lesions. Based on several well-known examples of DNA lesions like the UV radiation-induced CPD and 6\u20134 photodimers, as well as cisplatin-derived intrastrand cross-linked lesions, it is generally believed that the differences in excision activities in human cell extracts is correlated with the binding affinities of XPC-RAD23B to these DNA lesions. However, using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we have found that XPC-RAD23B binding affinities of certain bulky lesions derived from metabolically activated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds such as benzo[a]pyrene and dibenzo[a,l]pyrene, are not directly, or necessarily correlated with NER excision activities observed in cell-free extracts. These findings point to features of XPC-RAD23B\u2013bulky DNA adduct complexes that may involve the formation of NER-productive or unproductive forms of binding that depend on the structural and stereochemical properties of the DNA adducts studied. The pronounced differences in NER cleavage efficiencies observed in cell-free extracts may be due to differences in the successful recruitment of subsequent NER factors by the XPC-RAD23B\u2013DNA adduct complexes, and/or in the verification step. These phenomena appear to depend on the structural and conformational properties of the class of bulky DNA adducts studied.",

Damage identification is a challenge for all DNA damage response proteins, but especially for nucleases that cut the DNA and necessarily create a cleaved DNA repair intermediate, likely more toxic than the initial damage. How do these enzymes achieve exquisite specificity without specific sequence recognition or, in some cases, without a non-canonical DNA nucleotide? Combined structural, biochemical, and biological analyses of repair nucleases are revealing their molecular tools for damage verification and safeguarding against inadvertent incision. Surprisingly, these enzymes also often act on RNA, which deserves more attention.

DNA and RNA structure-sensing nucleases are essential to life with roles in DNA replication, repair, and transcription. Increasingly these enzymes are employed as advanced tools for synthetic biology and as targets for cancer prognosis and interventions. Currently their structural biology is most fully illuminated for DNA repair, which is also essential to life. How DNA repair enzymes maintain genome fidelity is one of the DNA double helix secrets missed by James Watson and Francis Crick, that is only now being illuminated though structural biology and mutational analyses. Structures reveal motifs for repair nucleases and mechanisms whereby these enzymes follow the old carpenter adage: measure twice, cut once. Furthermore, to measure twice these nucleases act as molecular level transformers that typically reshape the DNA and sometimes themselves to achieve extraordinary specificity and efficiency.",

     "abstract": "DNA strand breaks arise continuously in cells and can lead to chromosome rearrangements and genome instability or cell death. The commonest DNA breaks are DNA single-strand breaks, which arise at a frequency of tens-of-thousands per cell each day and which can block the progression of RNA/DNA polymerases and disrupt gene transcription and genome duplication. If not rapidly repaired, SSBs can be converted into DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during genome duplication, eliciting a complex series of DNA damage responses that attempt to protect cells from irreversible replication fork collapse. DSBs are the most cytotoxic and clastogenic type of DNA breaks, and can also arise independently of DNA replication, albeit at a frequency several orders of magnitude lower than SSBs. Here, I discuss the evidence that DNA single- and double -strand break repair pathways, and cellular tolerance mechanisms for protecting replication forks during genome duplication, utilize signalling by protein ADP-ribosyltransferases to protect cells from the harmful impact of DNA strand breakage.",

Yet, both enzymes have an extended spectrum of activities. TDP1 not only excises trapped topoisomerases I (Top1 in the nucleus and Top1mt in mitochondria), but also repairs oxidative damage-induced 3\u2032-phosphoglycolates and alkylation damage-induced DNA breaks, and excises chain terminating anticancer and antiviral nucleosides in the nucleus and mitochondria. The repair function of TDP2 is devoted to the excision of topoisomerase II- and potentially topoisomerases III-DNA adducts. TDP2 is also essential for the life cycle of picornaviruses (important human and bovine pathogens) as it unlinks VPg proteins from the 5\u2032-end of the viral RNA genome. Moreover, TDP2 has been involved in signal transduction (under the former names of TTRAP or EAPII). The DNA repair partners of TDP1 include PARP1, XRCC1, ligase III and PNKP from the base excision repair (BER) pathway. By contrast, TDP2 repair functions are coordinated with Ku and ligase IV in the non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ). This article summarizes and compares the biochemistry, functions, and post-translational regulation of TDP1 and TDP2, as well as the relevance of TDP1 and TDP2 as determinants of response to anticancer agents. We discuss the rationale for developing TDP inhibitors for combinations with topoisomerase inhibitors (topotecan, irinotecan, doxorubicin, etoposide, mitoxantrone) and DNA damaging agents (temozolomide, bleomycin, cytarabine, and ionizing radiation), and as novel antiviral agents.",

     "abstract": "Thymineless death (TLD), a phenomenon in which thymine auxotrophy becomes lethal when cells are starved of thymine, can be prevented by the presence of rifampicin, an RNA polymerase inhibitor. Several lines of evidence link TLD to chromosome initiation events. This suggests that rifampicin-mediated TLD suppression could be due to the inhibition of RNA synthesis required for DNA chromosomal initiation at oriC, although other mechanisms cannot be discarded. In this work, we show that the addition of different rifampicin concentrations to thymine-starved cells modulates TLD and chromosomal initiation capacity (ChIC). Time-lapse experiments find increasing levels of ChIC during thymine starvation correlated with the accumulation of simple-Y, double-Y and bubble arc replication intermediates at the oriC region as visualized by two-dimensional DNA agarose gel electrophoresis. None of these structures were observed following rifampicin addition or under genetic-physiological conditions that suppress TLD, indicating that abortive chromosome replication initiations under thymine starvation are crucial for this lethality. Significantly, the introduction of mioC and gid mutations which alter transcription levels around oriC, reduces ChIC and alleviates TLD. These results show that the impairment of transcription-dependent initiation caused by rifampicin addition, is responsible for TLD suppression. Our findings here may provide new avenues for the development of improved antibacterial treatments and chemotherapies based on thymine starvation-induced cell death.",

Msh2\u2013Msh3 is also required for 3\u2032 non-homologous tail removal (3\u2032NHTR) in double-strand break repair. In both pathways, Msh2\u2013Msh3 binds double-strand/single-strand junctions and initiates repair in an ATP-dependent manner. However, we recently demonstrated that the two pathways have distinct requirements with respect to Msh2\u2013Msh3 activities. We identified a set of aromatic residues in the nucleotide binding pocket (FLY motif) of Msh3 that, when mutated, disrupted MMR, but left 3\u2032NHTR largely intact. One of these mutations, msh3Y942A, was predicted to disrupt the nucleotide sandwich and allow altered positioning of ATP within the pocket. To develop a mechanistic understanding of the differential requirements for ATP binding and/or hydrolysis in the two pathways, we characterized Msh2\u2013Msh3 and Msh2\u2013msh3Y942A ATP binding and hydrolysis activities in the presence of MMR and 3\u2032NHTR DNA substrates. We observed distinct, substrate-dependent ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide turnover by Msh2\u2013Msh3, indicating that the MMR and 3\u2032NHTR DNA substrates differentially modify the ATP binding/hydrolysis activities of Msh2\u2013Msh3. Msh2\u2013msh3Y942A retained the ability to bind DNA and ATP but exhibited altered ATP hydrolysis and nucleotide turnover.

     "abstract": "Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a unique genotoxin produced by several pathogenic bacteria. The tripartite protein toxin is internalized into mammalian cells via endocytosis followed by retrograde transport to the ER. Upon translocation into the nucleus, CDT catalyzes the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) due to its intrinsic endonuclease activity. In the present study, we compared the DNA damage response (DDR) in human fibroblasts triggered by recombinant CDT to that of ionizing radiation (IR), a well-known DSB inducer. Furthermore, we dissected the pathways involved in the detection and repair of CDT-induced DNA lesions. qRT-PCR array-based mRNA and western blot analyses showed a partial overlap in the DDR pattern elicited by CDT and IR, with strong activation of both the ATM-Chk2 and the ATR-Chk1 axis. In line with its in vitro DNase I-like activity on plasmid DNA, neutral and alkaline Comet assay revealed predominant induction of DSBs in CDT-treated fibroblasts, whereas irradiation of cells generated higher amounts of SSBs and alkali-labile sites. Using confocal microscopy, the dynamics of the DSB surrogate marker \u03b3-H2AX was monitored after pulse treatment with CDT or IR. In contrast to the fast induction and disappearance of \u03b3-H2AX-foci observed in irradiated cells, the number of \u03b3-H2AX-foci induced by CDT were formed with a delay and persisted. 53BP1 foci were also generated following CDT treatment and co-localized with \u03b3-H2AX foci. We further demonstrated that ATM-deficient cells are very sensitive to CDT-induced DNA damage as reflected by increased cell death rates with concomitant cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP-1. Finally, we provided novel evidence that both homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) protect against CDT-elicited DSBs. In conclusion, the findings suggest that CDT functions as a radiomimetic agent and, therefore, is an attractive tool for selectively inducing persistent levels of DSBs and unveiling the associated cellular responses.",

The impact of DNA damage depends on the specific site as well as the cellular state. The steady-state level of DNA damage is the net result of continuous formation and subsequent repair, but it is unknown to what extent heterogeneous damage distribution is caused by variations in formation or repair of DNA damage. Here, we used a restriction enzyme/qPCR based method to analyze DNA damage in promoter and coding regions of four nuclear genes: the two house-keeping genes Gadph and Tbp, and the Ndufa9 and Ndufs2 genes encoding mitochondrial complex I subunits, as well as mt-Rnr1 encoded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). The distribution of steady-state levels of damage varied in a site-specific manner. Oxidative stress induced damage in nDNA to a similar extent in promoter and coding regions, and more so in mtDNA. The subsequent removal of damage from nDNA was efficient and comparable with recovery times depending on the initial damage load, while repair of mtDNA was delayed with subsequently slower repair rate. The repair was furthermore found to be independent of transcription or the transcription-coupled repair factor CSB, but dependent on cellular ATP. Our results demonstrate that the capacity to repair DNA is sufficient to remove exogenously induced damage. Thus, we conclude that the heterogeneous steady-state level of DNA damage in promoters and coding regions is caused by site-specific DNA damage/modifications that take place under normal metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress via redox reactions can regulate DNA repair pathways. The base excision repair (BER) enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is a key player in the redox regulation of DNA repair. Environmental factors can alter the methylation of DNA repair genes, change their expression and thus modulate BER activity and susceptibility to oxidative DNA damage. Therefore, we hypothesized that epigenetic modifications play a role in the redox regulation of APE1 in hippocampi of newborns and investigated the effect of supplementation of pregnant sows with a diet enriched in antioxidants and other nutrients on oxidative stress, DNA methylation and DNA repair in their offspring. High levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) and low levels of glutathione were detected in control piglets after birth compared with supplemented piglets, indicating the presence of oxidative stress. In control animals, this oxidative stress was associated with genomic DNA demethylation, decreased APE1 promoter methylation, increased APE1 expression and with slightly but not statistically significant increased BER-related DNA incision activity. Supplementation of piglets with antioxidants and other nutrients significantly lowered 8-oxodG levels compared to control animals, which was accompanied by overall lower APE1 promoter methylation and enhanced APE1 expression at day 7\u201328 after birth in supplemented piglets, although DNA incision activity was not significantly different between groups. Preliminary attempts to study the interaction between redox and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms revealed an inverse correlation between APE1 expression and methylation of CpG-sites 11 and 13 in the promoter region, which according to Genomatix \u201cMatInspector\u201d are located in the core binding sites of redox-sensitive transcription factors. We are the first to study methylation of the APE1 promoter and its role in mediating the functional effects of redox reactions induced by oxidative stress.

     "abstract": "During replication in yeast, the three B family DNA replicases frequently incorporate ribonucleotides (rNMPs) into DNA, and their presence in the nuclear genome can affect genome stability. This prompted us to examine ribonucleotide incorporation by the fourth B family member, Pol \u03b6, the enzyme responsible for the majority of damage-induced mutagenesis in eukaryotes. We first show that Pol \u03b6 inserts rNMPs into DNA and can extend primer termini containing 3\u2032-ribonucleotides. We then measure rNMP incorporation by Pol \u03b6 in the presence of its cofactors, RPA, RFC and PCNA and at normal cellular dNTP and rNTP concentrations that exist under unstressed conditions. Under these conditions, Pol \u03b6 stably incorporates one rNMP for every 200\u2013300 dNMPs incorporated, a frequency that is slightly higher than for the high fidelity replicative DNA polymerases. Under damage-induced conditions wherein cellular dNTP concentrations are elevated 5-fold, Pol \u03b6 only incorporates one rNMP per 1300 dNMPs. Functional interaction of Pol \u03b6 with the mutasome assembly factor Rev1 gives comparable rNMP incorporation frequencies. These results suggest that ribonucleotide incorporation into DNA during Pol \u03b6-mediated mutagenesis in vivo may be rare.",

NHEJ rejoins these programmed DSBs. Consequently, NHEJ deficiency confers (severe) combined immunodeficiency \u2013 (S)CID \u2013 due to a failure to carry out V(D)J recombination efficiently. NHEJ also functions in class switch recombination, another step enhancing T and B cell diversity.

     "abstract": "High linear energy transfer (LET) ionising radiation (IR) such as radon-derived alpha particles and high mass, high energy (HZE) particles of cosmic radiation are the predominant forms of IR to which humanity is exposed throughout life. High-LET forms of IR are established carcinogens relevant to human cancer, and their potent mutagenicity is believed, in part, to be due to a greater incidence of clustered DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and associated lesions, as ionization events occur within a more confined genomic space. The repair of such DNA damage is now well-documented to occur with slower kinetics relative to that induced by low-LET IR, and to be more reliant upon homology-directed repair pathways. Underlying these phenomena is the relative inability of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) to adequately resolve high-LET IR-induced DSBs. Current findings suggest that the functionality of the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), comprised of the Ku70-Ku80 heterodimer and the DNA-PK catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs), is particularly perturbed by high-LET IR-induced clustered DSBs, rendering DNA-PK dependent NHEJ less relevant to resolving these lesions. By contrast, the NHEJ-associated DNA processing endonuclease Artemis shows a greater relevance to high-LET IR-induced DSB repair. Here, we will review the cellular response to high-LET irradiation, the implications of the chronic, low-dose modality of this exposure and molecular pathways that respond to high-LET irradiation induced DSBs, with particular emphasis on NHEJ factors.",

Here we focus on structural aspects of the interactions of LigIV with XRCC4, XLF, Artemis and DNA involved in the bridging and end-joining steps of NHEJ. We begin with a discussion of the role of XLF, which interacts with Ku and forms a hetero-filament with XRCC4; this likely forms a scaffold bridging the DNA ends. We then review the well-defined interaction of XRCC4 with LigIV, and discuss the possibility of this complex interrupting the filament formation, so positioning the ligase at the correct positions close to the broken ends. We also describe the interactions of LigIV with Artemis, the nuclease that prepares the ends for ligation and also interacts with DNA-PK.

NHEJ is also needed for V(D)J recombination and the development of T and B cells in vertebrate immune systems, and acts in both the generation and prevention of non-homologous chromosomal translocations, a hallmark of genomic instability and many human cancers. X-ray crystal structures, cryo-electron microscopy envelopes, and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) solution conformations and assemblies are defining most of the core protein components for NHEJ: Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer; the DNA dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs); the structure-specific endonuclease Artemis along with polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP), aprataxin and PNKP related protein (APLF); the scaffolding proteins XRCC4 and XLF (XRCC4-like factor); DNA polymerases, and DNA ligase IV (Lig IV). The dynamic assembly of multi-protein NHEJ complexes at DSBs is regulated in part by protein phosphorylation. The basic steps of NHEJ have been biochemically defined to require: (1) DSB detection by the Ku heterodimer with subsequent DNA-PKcs tethering to form the DNA-PKcs-Ku-DNA complex (termed DNA-PK), (2) lesion processing, and (3) DNA end ligation by Lig IV, which functions in complex with XRCC4 and XLF. The current integration of structures by combined methods is resolving puzzles regarding the mechanisms, coordination and regulation of these three basic steps. Overall, structural results suggest the NHEJ system forms a flexing scaffold with the DNA-PKcs HEAT repeats acting as compressible macromolecular springs suitable to store and release conformational energy to apply forces to regulate NHEJ complexes and the DNA substrate for DNA end protection, processing, and ligation.",

     "abstract": "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are a particularly cytotoxic variety of DNA lesion that can be repaired by homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). HR utilises sequences homologous to the damage DNA template to facilitate repair. In contrast, NHEJ does not require homologous sequences for repair but instead functions by directly re-joining DNA ends. These pathways are critical to resolve DSBs generated intentionally during processes such as meiotic and site-specific recombination. However, they are also utilised to resolve potentially pathological DSBs generated by mutagens and errors during DNA replication. The importance of DSB repair is underscored by the findings that defects in these pathways results in chromosome instability that contributes to a variety of disease states including malignancy. The general principles of NHEJ are conserved in eukaryotes. As such, relatively simple model organisms have been instrumental in identifying components of these pathways and providing a mechanistic understanding of repair that has subsequently been applied to vertebrates. However, certain components of the NHEJ pathway are absent or show limited conservation in the most commonly used invertebrate models exploited to study DNA repair. Recently, however, it has become apparent that vertebrate DNA repair pathway components, including those involved in NHEJ, are unusually conserved in the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. Traditionally, this genetically tractable organism has been exploited to study the molecular basis of cell type specification, cell motility and chemotaxis.

However, the role of this domain is controversial because its presence does not affect NER. Using yeast RAD2, a homolog of human XPG, we show that Rad2p interacts with PCNA through its PCNA-BD and the PCNA-BD of Rad2p plays a role in UV-induced mutagenesis. While a mutation of Rad2p endonuclease activity alone causes dramatically increased mutation rates and UV sensitivity, as well as growth retardation after UV irradiation, a mutation of the Rad2p PCNA-BD in the same mutant causes dramatically decreased mutation rates, reduced UV sensitivity and increased growth rate after UV irradiation. After UV irradiation, large-budded cells of Rad2p endonuclease defective mutants wane due to a mutation of the Rad2p PCNA-BD. Besides, the Rad2p PCNA-BD mutant protein exhibits alleviated PCNA-binding efficiency. These results show a hitherto unsuspected role of the Rad2p PCNA-BD that controls mutagenesis via cell cycle modulation together with PCNA. Furthermore, the high mutation rate of cells with other NER gene mutations was also decreased by the mutation of the Rad2p PCNA-BD, which indicates that the Rad2p-PCNA interaction might be responsible for mutagenesis control in the general NER pathway. Our results suggest that the drastically increased incidence of skin cancer in xeroderma pigmentosum patients could arise from the synergistic effects between cell cycle arrest due to the XPG\u2013PCNA interaction and the accumulation of damaged DNA via defects in DNA damage repair.",

     "abstract": "DNA topoisomerases inter-convert different DNA topoisomers in the cell. They catalyze the introduction or relaxation of DNA supercoils, as well as catenation and decatenation. Members of the type I topoisomerase family cleave a single strand of their double-stranded DNA substrate, whereas enzymes of the type II family cleave both DNA strands. Bacterial DNA gyrase, a type II topoisomerase, catalyzes the introduction of negative supercoils into DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. Gyrase is not present in humans, and constitutes an attractive drug target for the treatment of bacterial and parasite infections. DNA supercoiling by gyrase is believed to occur by a strand passage mechanism, in which one segment of the double-stranded DNA substrate is passed through a (transient) break in a second segment. This mechanism requires the coordinated opening and closing of three protein interfaces, so-called gates, to ensure the directionality of strand passage toward negative supercoiling.Single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments are ideally suited to investigate conformational changes during the catalytic cycle of DNA topoisomerases. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the cascade of DNA- and nucleotide-induced conformational changes in gyrase that lead to strand passage and negative supercoiling of DNA. We discuss how these conformational changes couple ATP hydrolysis to DNA supercoiling in gyrase, and how the common mechanistic principle of coordinated gate opening and closing is modulated to allow for the catalysis of different reactions by different type II topoisomerases.",

     "abstract": "The base excision repair (BER) pathway is a conserved DNA repair system required to maintain genomic integrity and prevent mutagenesis in all eukaryotic cells. Nevertheless, how BER operates in vivo (i.e. in the context of chromatin) is poorly understood. We have investigated the role of an essential ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling (ACR) complex RSC (Remodels the Structure of Chromatin) in BER of intact yeast cells. We show that depletion of STH1, the ATPase subunit of RSC, causes enhanced sensitivity to the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and results in a substantial inhibition of BER, at the GAL1 locus and in the genome overall. Consistent with this observation, the DNA in chromatin is less accessible to micrococcal nuclease digestion in the absence of RSC. Quantitative PCR results indicate that repair deficiency in STH1 depleted cells is not due to changes in the expression of BER genes. Collectively, our data indicates the RSC complex promotes efficient BER in chromatin. These results provide, for the first time, a link between ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling and BER in living cells.",

     "abstract": "Base excision repair (BER) is the most prominent DNA repair pathway in human mitochondria. BER also results in a temporary generation of AP-sites, single-strand breaks and nucleotide gaps. Thus, incomplete BER can result in the generation of DNA repair intermediates that can disrupt mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription and generate mutations. We carried out BER analysis in highly purified mitochondrial extracts from human cell lines U2OS and HeLa, and mouse brain using a circular DNA substrate containing a lesion at a specific position. We found that DNA ligation is significantly slower than the preceding mitochondrial BER steps. Overexpression of DNA ligase III in mitochondria improved the rate of overall BER, increased cell survival after menadione induced oxidative stress and reduced autophagy following the inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex I by rotenone. Our results suggest that the amount of DNA ligase III in mitochondria may be critical for cell survival following prolonged oxidative stress, and demonstrate a functional link between mitochondrial DNA damage and repair, cell survival upon oxidative stress, and removal of dysfunctional mitochondria by autophagy.",

     "abstract": "Cancer risk and radiation sensitivity are often associated with alterations in DNA repair, cell cycle, or apoptotic pathways. Interindividual variability in mutagen or radiation sensitivity and in cancer susceptibility may also be traced back to polymorphisms of genes affecting e.g. DNA repair capacity. We studied possible associations between 70 polymorphisms of 12 DNA repair genes with basal and initial DNA damage and with repair thereof. We investigated DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation in lymphocytes isolated from 177 young lung cancer patients and 169 cancer-free controls. We also sought replication of our findings in an independent sample of 175 families (in total 798 individuals). DNA damage was assessed by the Olive tail moment (OTM) of the comet assay. DNA repair capacity (DRC) was determined for 10, 30 and, 60\u00a0min of repair.Genes involved in the single-strand-repair pathway (SSR; like XRCC1 and MSH2) as well as genes involved in the double-strand-repair pathway (DSR; like RAD50, XRCC4, MRE11 and ATM) were found to be associated with DNA damage. The most significant association was observed for marker rs3213334 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) of XRCC1 with basal DNA damage (B), in both cases and controls. A clear additive effect on the logarithm of OTM was identified for the marker rs1001581 of the same LD-block (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039): BCC\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.06 (95%-CI: \u22121.16 to \u22120.96), BCT\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.02 (95%-CI: \u22121.11 to \u22120.93) and BTT\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.85 (95%-CI: \u22121.01 to \u22120.68). In both cases and controls, we observed significantly higher DNA basal damage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) for carriers of the genotype AA of marker rs2237060 of RAD50 (involved in DSR). However, this could not be replicated in the sample of families (p\u00a0=\u00a00.781). An alteration to DRC after 30\u00a0min of repair with respect to cases was observed as borderline significant for marker rs611646 of ATM (involved in DSR; p\u00a0=\u00a00.055), but was the most significant finding in the sample of families (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009).Our data indicate that gene variation impacts measurably on DNA damage and repair, suggesting at least a partial contribution to radiation sensitivity and lung cancer susceptibility.",

Our aim was to characterize internal and external factors that underlie inter-individual variability in DNA damage and repair and to identify dietary habits beneficial for maintaining DNA integrity.Habitual diet was estimated in 340 healthy individuals using a food frequency questionnaire and biomarkers of antioxidant status were quantified in fasting blood samples. Markers of DNA integrity were represented by DNA strand breaks, oxidized purines, oxidized pyrimidines and a sum of all three as total DNA damage. DNA repair was characterized by genetic variants and functional activities of base and nucleotide excision repair pathways.Sex, fruit-based food consumption and XPG genotype were factors significantly associated with the level of DNA damage. DNA damage was higher in women (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035). Fruit consumption was negatively associated with the number of all measured DNA lesions, and this effect was mediated mostly by \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and \u03b2-tocopherol (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). XPG 1104His homozygotes appeared more vulnerable to DNA damage accumulation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Sex and individual antioxidants were also associated with DNA repair capacity; both the base and nucleotide excision repairs were lower in women and the latter increased with higher plasma levels of ascorbic acid and \u03b1-carotene (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).We have determined genetic and dietary factors that modulate DNA integrity. We propose that the positive health effect of fruit intake is partially mediated via DNA damage suppression and a simultaneous increase in DNA repair capacity.",

     "abstract": "DNA post-replication repair (PRR) functions to bypass replication-blocking lesions and is subdivided into two parallel pathways: error-prone translesion DNA synthesis and error-free PRR. While both pathways are dependent on the ubiquitination of PCNA, error-free PRR utilizes noncanonical K63-linked polyubiquitinated PCNA to signal lesion bypass through template switch, a process thought to be dependent on Mms2-Ubc13 and a RING finger motif of the Rad5 ubiquitin ligase. Previous in vitro studies demonstrated the ability of Rad5 to promote replication fork regression, a function dependent on its helicase activity. To investigate the genetic and mechanistic relationship between fork regression in vitro and template switch in vivo, we created and characterized site-specific mutations defective in the Rad5 RING or helicase activity. Our results indicate that both the Rad5 ubiquitin ligase and the helicase activities are exclusively involved in the same error-free PRR pathway. Surprisingly, the Rad5 helicase mutation abolishes its physical interaction with Ubc13 and the K63-linked PCNA polyubiquitin chain assembly. Indeed, physical fusions of Rad5 with Ubc13 bypass the requirement for either the helicase or the RING finger domain. Since the helicase domain overlaps with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling domain, our findings suggest a structural role of this domain and that the Rad5 helicase activity is dispensable for error-free lesion bypass.",

Defects in NHEJ proteins confer marked radiosensitivity in cell lines and mice models, since radiation potently induces DSBs. The process of V(D)J recombination functions during the development of the immune response, and involves the introduction and rejoining of programmed DSBs to generate an array of diverse T and B cells. NHEJ rejoins these programmed DSBs. Consequently, NHEJ deficiency confers (severe) combined immunodeficiency \u2013 (S)CID \u2013 due to a failure to carry out V(D)J recombination efficiently. NHEJ also functions in class switch recombination, another step enhancing T and B cell diversity.

Mutations in NHEJ genes, defining human syndromes deficient in DNA ligase IV (LIG4 Syndrome), XLF-Cernunnos, Artemis or DNA-PKcs, have been identified in such patients. Mutations in XRCC4 or Ku70,80 in patients have not been identified. RS-SCID patients frequently display additional characteristics including microcephaly, dysmorphic facial features and growth delay.

     "abstract": "Oxidative DNA damage is repaired primarily by the base excision repair (BER) pathway in a process initiated by removal of base lesions or mismatched bases by DNA glycosylases. MutY homolog (MYH, MUTYH, or Myh1) is a DNA glycosylase which excises adenine paired with the oxidative lesion 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG, or G\u00b0), thus reducing G:C to T:A mutations. The resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site is processed by an AP-endonuclease or a bifunctional glycosylase/lyase. We show here that the major Schizosaccharomyces pombe AP endonuclease, Apn2, binds to the inter-domain connector located between the N- and C-terminal domains of Myh1. This Myh1 inter-domain connector also interacts with the Hus1 subunit of the Rad9\u2013Rad1\u2013Hus1 checkpoint clamp. Mutagenesis studies indicate that Apn2 and Hus1 bind overlapping but different sequence motifs on Myh1. Mutation on I261 of Myh1 reduces its interaction with Hus1, but only slightly attenuates its interaction with Apn2. However, E262 of Myh1 is a key determinant for both Apn2 and Hus1 interactions. Like human APE1, Apn2 has 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase activity. However, unlike hAPE1, Apn2 has a weak AP endonuclease activity which cleaves the AP sites generated by Myh1 glycosylase. Functionally, Apn2 stimulates Myh1 glycosylase activity and Apn2 phosphodiesterase activity is stimulated by Myh1. The cross stimulation of Myh1 and Apn2 enzymatic activities is dependent on their physical interaction. Thus, Myh1 and Apn2 constitute an initial BER complex.",

Targeted mutagenesis methods site-specifically replace endogenous DNA bases with bases carrying synthetic adducts using targeting vectors. The TATAM system was enabled by introduction of site-specific DNA double strand breaks (DSB), which strongly enhanced targeting efficiency through homologous recombination (HR), and a new polymerase chain reaction-based technique, which gives high yields of the target vectors carrying DNA adducts. Human lymphoblastoid TSCER122 cells are compound heterozygous for the thymidine kinase gene (TK\u2212/\u2212), and have a homing endonuclease I-SceI site in intron 4 of the TK gene. The TATAM system enabled targeting of the TK\u2212 allele with the I-SceI site using a synthetic TK+ allele containing an 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) adduct, a typical product of oxidative DNA damage. The targeted clones (TK+/\u2212) were then isolated by drug selection. Site-specific HR for DSB induced by I-SceI improved targeted integration of the synthetic allele by five orders of magnitude (from 10\u22127 to 10\u22122). Subsequent analyses of approximately 800 target clones revealed that 8-oxoG was restored to G in 86% clones, probably reflecting base excision repair or translesion synthesis without mutation. Lesions of the remaining clones (14%) were associated with mutations. The mutation spectrum corresponded closely with that of oxidative DNA damage inducers reported, in which G:C to T:A transversions (5.9%) were predominant. Over-expression of MutY homologs in cells, which prevents G:C to T:A transversions by removing 8-oxoG:A mispairing, significantly decreased the frequency of mutations to 2.6%, indicating that the 8-oxoG adducts introduced by the TATAM system are processed in the same manner as those generated by oxidative DNA damage.",

DNA polymerase kappa (Pol \u03ba) bypasses benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide-N2-deoxyguanine (BPDE-N2-dG) DNA adducts in an almost error-free manner. In the previous work, we changed the amino acids close to the adducts in the active site and examined the bypass efficiency. The substitution of alanine for phenylalanine 171 (F171A) enhanced by 18-fold in vitro, the efficiencies of dCMP incorporation opposite (\u2212)- and (+)-trans-anti-BPDE-N2-dG. In the present study, we established human cell lines that express wild-type Pol \u03ba (POLK+/\u2212), F171A (POLK F171A/\u2212) or lack expression of Pol \u03ba (POLK\u2212/\u2212) to examine the in vivo significance. These cell lines were generated with Nalm-6, a human pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, which has high efficiency for gene targeting.

     "abstract": "Faithful transmission of genetic material is essential for cell viability and organism health. The occurrence of DNA damage, due to either spontaneous events or environmental agents, threatens the integrity of the genome. The consequences of these insults, if allowed to perpetuate and accumulate over time, are mutations that can lead to the development of diseases such as cancer. Alkylation is a relevant DNA lesion produced endogenously as well as by exogenous agents including certain chemotherapeutics. We sought to better understand the cellular response to this form of DNA damage using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. For this purpose, we performed sub-cellular fractionation to monitor the effect of methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment on protein localization to chromatin. The levels of over 500 proteins were increased in the chromatin-enriched nuclear lysate including histone chaperones. Levels of ubiquitin and subunits of the proteasome were also increased within this fraction, suggesting that ubiquitin-mediated degradation by the proteasome has an important role in the chromatin response to MMS treatment. Finally, the levels of some proteins were decreased within the chromatin-enriched lysate including components of the nuclear pore complex. Our spatial proteomics data demonstrate that many proteins that influence chromatin organization are regulated in response to MMS treatment, presumably to open the DNA to allow access by other DNA damage response proteins. To gain further insight into the cellular response to MMS-induced DNA damage, we also performed phosphorylation enrichment on total cell lysates to identify proteins regulated via post-translational modification. Phosphoproteomic analysis demonstrated that many nuclear phosphorylation events were decreased in response to MMS treatment. This reflected changes in protein kinase and/or phosphatase activity in response to DNA damage rather than changes in total protein abundance. Using these two mass spectrometry-based approaches, we have identified a novel set of MMS-responsive proteins that will expand our understanding of DNA damage signaling.",

A core C-NHEJ component is the DNA ligase IV co-factor, Cernunnos/XLF (hereafter XLF). In patients, mutations in XLF cause predicted increases in radiosensitivity and deficits in immune function, but also cause other less well-understood pathologies including neural disorders. To characterize XLF function(s) in a defined genetic system, we used a recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene targeting strategy to inactivate both copies of the XLF locus in the human HCT116 cell line. Analyses of XLF-null cells (which were viable) showed that they were highly sensitive to ionizing radiation and a radiomimetic DNA damaging agent, etoposide. XLF-null cells had profound DNA DSB repair defects as measured by in vivo plasmid end-joining assays and were also dramatically impaired in their ability to form either V(D)J coding or signal joints on extrachromosomal substrates. Thus, our somatic XLF-null cell line recapitulates many of the phenotypes expected from XLF patient cell lines. Subsequent structure:function experiments utilizing the expression of wild-type and mutant XLF cDNAs demonstrated that all of the phenotypes of an XLF deficiency could be rescued by the overexpression of a wild-type XLF cDNA. Unexpectedly, mutant forms of XLF bearing point mutations at amino acid positions L115 and L179, also completely complemented the null phenotype suggesting, in contrast to predictions to the contrary, that these mutations do not abrogate XLF function. Finally, we demonstrate that the absence of XLF causes a small, but significant, increase in homologous recombination, implicating XLF in DSB pathway choice regulation. We conclude that human XLF is a non-essential, but critical, C-NHEJ-repair factor.",

     "abstract": "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are highly toxic to the cells and accumulation of DSBs results in several detrimental effects in various cellular processes which can lead to neurological, immunological and developmental disorders. Failure of the repair of DSBs spurs mutagenesis and is a driver of tumorigenesis, thus underscoring the importance of the accurate repair of DSBs. Two major canonical DSB repair pathways are the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways. 53BP1 and BRCA1 are the key mediator proteins which coordinate with other components of the DNA repair machinery in the NHEJ and HR pathways respectively, and their exclusive recruitment to DNA breaks/ends potentially decides the choice of repair by either NHEJ or HR. Recently, Rap1 interacting factor 1 has been identified as an important component of the DNA repair pathway which acts downstream of the ATM/53BP1 to inhibit the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 end resection of broken DNA ends, in-turn facilitating NHEJ repair and inhibiting homology directed repair. Rif1 is conserved from yeast to humans but its function has evolved from telomere length regulation in yeast to the maintenance of genome integrity in mammalian cells. Recently its role in the maintenance of genomic integrity has been expanded to include the regulation of chromatin structure, replication timing and intra-S phase checkpoint. We present a summary of these important findings highlighting the various aspects of Rif1 functions and discuss the key implications for genomic integrity.",

End-processing activities and the RecA protein itself contribute to increase RecN levels after DNA DSBs. RecO is required for RecA filament formation and full SOS induction, but its absence did not significantly affect RecN expression. Neither the absence of LexA nor the phosphorylation state of RecA or SsbA significantly affect RecN expression levels. These findings identify two major mechanisms (SOS and DSB response) used to respond to DSBs, with LexA required for one of them (SOS response). The DSB response, which requires end-processing and RecA or short RecO-independent RecA filaments, highlights the importance of guarding genome stability by modulating the DNA damage responses.",

In humans, three orthologs of the prototypical endonuclease VIII (Nei), the Nei-like NEIL1-3 enzymes are involved in the repair of oxidized DNA lesions. In recent years, several genome and cancer single-nucleotide polymorphic variants of the NEIL1 glycosylase have been identified. In this study we characterized four variants of human NEIL1: S82C, G83D, P208S, and \u0394E28, and tested their ability to excise pyrimidine-derived lesions such as thymine glycol (Tg), 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU), and dihydrouracil (DHU) and the purine-derived guanidinohydantoin (Gh), spiroiminodihydantoin 1 (Sp1), and methylated 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (MeFapyG). The P208S variant has near wild-type activity on all substrates tested. The S82C and \u0394E28 variants exhibit decreased Tg excision compared to wild-type. G83D displays little to no activity with any of the substrates tested, with the exception of Gh and Sp1. Human NEIL1 is known to undergo editing whereby the lysine at position 242 is recoded into an arginine. The non-edited form of NEIL1 is more efficient at cleaving Tg than the R242 form, but the G83D variant does not cleave Tg regardless of the edited status of NEIL1. The corresponding G86D variant in Mimivirus Nei1 similarly lacks glycosylase activity. A structure of a G86D\u2013DNA complex reveals a rearrangement in the \u03b24/5 loop comprising Leu84, the highly-conserved void-filling residue, thereby providing a structural rationale for the decreased glycosylase activity of the glycine to aspartate variant.",

TLS may act at stalled replication forks or through an S-phase independent gap-filling mechanism. After UVC irradiation, Pol\u03b7-deficient (XP-V) human cells were arrested in early S-phase and exhibited both single-strand DNA (ssDNA) and prolonged replication fork stalling, as detected by DNA fiber assay. In contrast, NER deficiency in XP-C cells caused no apparent defect in S-phase progression despite the accumulation of ssDNA and a G2-phase arrest. These data indicate that while Pol\u03b7 is essential for DNA synthesis at ongoing damaged replication forks, NER deficiency might unmask the involvement of tolerance pathway through a gap-filling mechanism. ATR knock down by siRNA or caffeine addition provoked increased cell death in both XP-V and XP-C cells exposed to low-dose of UVC, underscoring the involvement of ATR/Chk1 pathway in both DNA damage tolerance mechanisms. We generated a unique human cell line deficient in XPC and Pol\u03b7 proteins, which exhibited both S- and G2-phase arrest after UVC irradiation, consistent with both single deficiencies. In these XP-C/Pol\u03b7KD cells, UVC-induced replicative intermediates may collapse into double-strand breaks, leading to cell death. In conclusion, both TLS at stalled replication forks and gap-filling are active mechanisms for the tolerance of UVC-induced DNA damage in human cells and the preference for one or another pathway depends on the cellular genotype.",

It also removes 3\u2032-blocking residues derived from oxidative damage or incorporation of chain terminating anticancer and antiviral nucleosides. Thus, TDP1 is regarded as a determinant of resistance to Top1 inhibitors and chain terminating nucleosides, and possibly of genomic stability. In the 60 cell lines of the NCI Developmental Therapeutic Anticancer Screen (the NCI-60), whose whole genome transcriptome and mutations have recently been characterized, we discovered two human lung cancer cell lines deficient for TDP1 (NCI_H522 and HOP_62). HOP_62 shows undetectable TDP1 mRNA and NCI_H522 bears a homozygous deleterious mutation of TDP1 at a highly conserved amino acid residue (K292E). Absence of TDP1 protein and lack of TDP1 catalytic activity were demonstrated in cell lysates from both cell lines. Lack of TDP1 expression in HOP_62 was shown to be due to TDP1 promoter hypermethylation.

Mutations in the human MYH (hMYH) gene are associated with the colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome MYH-associated polyposis. To examine the function of MYH in human cells, we regulated MYH gene expression by knockdown or overproduction. MYH knockdown human HeLa cells are more sensitive to the killing effects of H2O2 than the control cells. In addition, hMYH knockdown cells have altered cell morphology, display enhanced susceptibility to apoptosis, and have altered DNA signaling activation in response to oxidative stress. The cell cycle progression of hMYH knockdown cells is also different from that of the control cells following oxidative stress. Moreover, hMYH knockdown cells contain higher levels of 8-oxo-G lesions than the control cells following H2O2 treatment. Although MYH does not directly remove 8-oxo-G, MYH may generate favorable substrates for other repair enzymes. Overexpression of mouse Myh (mMyh) in human mismatch repair defective HCT15 cells makes the cells more resistant to killing and refractory to apoptosis by oxidative stress than the cells transfected with vector.

A-T is caused by mutations in the kinase ATM, a master regulator of the DNA double-strand break response. In addition to DNA-damage signaling defects, A-T cells display mitochondrial dysfunction that is thought to contribute to A-T pathogenesis. However, the molecular mechanism leading to mitochondrial dysfunction in A-T remains unclear. Here, we show that lack of ATM leads to reduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) integrity and mitochondrial dysfunction, which are associated to defective mtDNA repair. While protein levels of mtDNA repair proteins are essentially normal, in the absence of ATM levels specifically of DNA ligase III (Lig3), the only DNA ligase working in mitochondria is reduced. The reduction of Lig3 is observed in different A-T patient cells, in brain and pre-B cells derived from ATM knockout mice as well as upon transient or stable knockdown of ATM. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of Lig3 in wild type cells phenocopies the mtDNA repair defects observed in A-T patient cells. As targeted deletion of LIG3 in the central nervous system causes debilitating ataxia in mice, reduced Lig3 protein levels and the consequent mtDNA repair defect may contribute to A-T neurodegeneration. A-T is thus the first disease characterized by diminished Lig3.",

DNA damage by host-derived reactive oxygen/nitrogen species is hypothesized to be critical for the mutagenic process in Mtb thus, highlighting an important role for DNA repair enzymes in maintenance of genome fidelity. Formamidopyrimidine (Fpg/MutM/Fapy) and EndonucleaseVIII (Nei) constitute the Fpg/Nei family of DNA glycosylases and together with EndonucleaseIII (Nth) are central to the base excision repair pathway in bacteria. In this study we assess the contribution of Nei and Nth DNA repair enzymes in Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msm), which retains a single nth homologue and duplications of the Fpg (fpg1 and fpg2) and Nei (nei1 and nei2) homologues. Using an Escherichia coli nth deletion mutant, we confirm the functionality of the mycobacterial nth gene in the base excision repair pathway. Msm mutants lacking nei1, nei2 and nth individually or in combination did not display aberrant growth in broth culture. Deletion of nth individually results in increased UV-induced mutagenesis and combinatorial deletion with the nei homologues results in reduced survival under oxidative stress conditions and an increase in spontaneous mutagenesis to rifampicin. Deletion of nth together with the fpg homolgues did not result in any growth/survival defects or changes in mutation rate. Furthermore, no differential emergence of the common rifampicin resistance conferring genotypes were noted. Collectively, these data confirm a role for Nth in base excision repair in mycobacteria and further highlight a novel interplay between the Nth and Nei homologues in spontaneous mutagenesis.",

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one repair pathway implicated in TNR instability, although most previous work focussed on TNR contractions, not expansions. Here we investigated the role of NER in modulating expansions of threshold-length (CTG\u00b7CAG) repeats in yeast. We show that both the global genome and transcription-coupled repair subpathways promote expansions of threshold-length TNRs. Furthermore, NER works with the 26S proteasome to drive expansions, based on analysis of double mutants defective in both pathways, and of Rad23, a protein involved in both NER and the shuttling of ubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome. This work provides the first evidence that both subpathways of NER can promote threshold-length TNR expansions and that NER interacts with the proteasome to drive expansions.",

Remodeling of the DNA backbone promotes nucleotide flipping of the lesion and the complementary base into the solvent and toward the protein surface, respectively. The important features of this new DNA binding architecture that allow AlkD to distinguish between damaged and normal DNA without contacting the lesion are poorly understood. Here, we show through extensive mutational analysis that DNA binding and N3-methyladenine (3mA) and N7-methylguanine (7mG) excision are dependent upon each residue lining the DNA binding interface. Disrupting electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions with the DNA backbone substantially reduced binding affinity and catalytic activity.

     "abstract": "The incorporation of ribonucleotides in DNA has attracted considerable notice in recent years, since the pool of ribonucleotides can exceed that of the deoxyribonucleotides by at least 10\u201320-fold, and single ribonucleotide incorporation by DNA polymerases appears to be a common event. Moreover ribonucleotides are potentially mutagenic and lead to genome instability. As a consequence, errantly incorporated ribonucleotides are rapidly repaired in a process dependent upon RNase H enzymes. On the other hand, global genomic nucleotide excision repair (NER) in prokaryotes and eukaryotes removes damage caused by covalent modifications that typically distort and destabilize DNA through the production of lesions derived from bulky chemical carcinogens, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites, or via crosslinking. However, a recent study challenges this lesion-recognition paradigm. The work of Vaisman et al. (2013) [34] reveals that even a single ribonucleotide embedded in a deoxyribonucleotide duplex is recognized by the bacterial NER machinery in vitro. In their report, the authors show that spontaneous mutagenesis promoted by a steric-gate pol V mutant increases in uvrA, uvrB, or uvrC strains lacking rnhB (encoding RNase HII) and to a greater extent in an NER-deficient strain lacking both RNase HI and RNase HII. Using purified UvrA, UvrB, and UvrC proteins in in vitro assays they show that despite causing little distortion, a single ribonucleotide embedded in a DNA duplex is recognized and doubly-incised by the NER complex. We present the hypothesis to explain the recognition and/or verification of this small lesion, that the critical 2\u2032-OH of the ribonucleotide \u2013 with its unique electrostatic and hydrogen bonding properties \u2013 may act as a signal through interactions with amino acid residues of the prokaryotic NER complex that are not possible with DNA. Such a mechanism might also be relevant if it were demonstrated that the eukaryotic NER machinery likewise incises an embedded ribonucleotide in DNA.",

The specific gap-repair assay used allows repair events resolved as crossover versus noncrossover products to be distinguished, as well as the extent of heteroduplex DNA formed during recombination to be measured. To examine end resection, the efficiency and outcome of gap repair were monitored in the absence of the Exo1 exonuclease and the Sgs1 helicase. We found that either Exo1 or Sgs1 presence is sufficient to inhibit gap-repair efficiency over 10-fold, consistent with resection-mediated destruction of the introduced plasmid. In terms of DNA polymerase requirements for gap repair, we focused specifically on potential roles of the Pol \u03b6 and Pol \u03b7 translesion synthesis DNA polymerases.

     "abstract": "MutY homologue (MYH) is a DNA glycosylase which excises adenine paired with the oxidative lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG, or Go) during base excision repair (BER). Base excision by MYH results in an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site in the DNA where the DNA sugar\u2013phosphate backbone remains intact. A key feature of MYH activity is its physical interaction and coordination with AP endonuclease I (APE1), which subsequently nicks DNA 5\u2032 to the AP site. Because AP sites are mutagenic and cytotoxic, they must be processed by APE1 immediately after the action of MYH glycosylase. Our recent reports show that the interdomain connector (IDC) of human MYH (hMYH) maintains interactions with hAPE1 and the human checkpoint clamp Rad9\u2013Rad1\u2013Hus1 (9\u20131\u20131) complex. In this study, we used NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments to determine hMYH-binding site on hAPE1. Chemical shift perturbations indicate that the hMYH IDC peptide binds to the DNA-binding site of hAPE1 and an additional site which is distal to the APE1 DNA-binding interface. In these two binding sites, N212 and Q137 of hAPE1 are key mediators of the MYH/APE1 interaction. Intriguingly, despite the fact that hHus1 and hAPE1 both interact with the MYH IDC, hHus1 does not compete with hAPE1 for binding to hMYH. Rather, hHus1 stabilizes the hMYH/hAPE1 complex both in vitro and in cells. This is consistent with a common theme in BER, namely that the assembly of protein\u2013DNA complexes enhances repair by efficiently coordinating multiple enzymatic steps while simultaneously minimizing the release of harmful repair intermediates.",

     "abstract": "Gap-repair assays have been an important tool for studying the genetic control of homologous recombination in yeast. Sequence analysis of recombination products derived when a gapped plasmid is diverged relative to the chromosomal repair template additionally has been used to infer structures of strand-exchange intermediates. In the absence of the canonical mismatch repair pathway, mismatches present in these intermediates are expected to persist and segregate at the next round of DNA replication. In a mismatch repair defective (mlh1\u0394) background, however, we have observed that recombination-generated mismatches are often corrected to generate gene conversion or restoration events. In the analyses reported here, the source of the aberrant mismatch removal during gap repair was examined. We find that most mismatch removal is linked to the methylation status of the plasmid used in the gap-repair assay. Whereas more than half of Dam-methylated plasmids had patches of gene conversion and/or restoration interspersed with unrepaired mismatches, mismatch removal was observed in less than 10% of products obtained when un-methylated plasmids were used in transformation experiments. The methylation-linked removal of mismatches in recombination intermediates was due specifically to the nucleotide excision repair pathway, with such mismatch removal being partially counteracted by glycosylases of the base excision repair pathway. These data demonstrate that nucleotide excision repair activity is not limited to bulky, helix-distorting DNA lesions, but also targets removal of very modest perturbations in DNA structure. In addition to its effects on mismatch removal, methylation reduced the overall gap-repair efficiency, but this reduction was not affected by the status of excision repair pathways. Finally, gel purification of DNA prior to transformation reduced gap-repair efficiency four-fold in a nucleotide excision repair-defective background, indicating that the collateral introduction of UV damage can potentially compromise genetic interpretations.",

In humans there are three Nei-like (NEIL) glycosylases: NEIL1, 2, and 3.

The N-terminal region of MvNei2 is most closely related to NEIL3. Like NEIL3, MvNei2 bears a valine at position 2 instead of the usual proline and it lacks two of the three conserved void-filling residues present in other members of the Fpg/Nei family. Mutational analysis of the only conserved void-filling residue methionine 72 to alanine yields an MvNei2 variant with impaired glycosylase activity.

Previous work has shown that one type of recA mutation (e.g., recA4162 (I298V)) and one type of uvrD mutation (e.g., uvrD303 (D403A, D404A)) can differentially decrease SOS expression depending on the type of inducing treatments (UV damage versus RecA mutants that constitutively express SOS). Here it is tested using other SOS inducing conditions if there is a general feature of ssDNA generated during these treatments that allows recA4162 and uvrD303 to decrease SOS expression. The SOS inducing conditions tested include growing cells containing temperature-sensitive DNA replication mutations (dnaE486, dnaG2903, dnaN159, dnaZ2016 (at 37\u00a0\u00b0C)), a del(polA)501 mutation and induction of Double-Strand Breaks (DSBs). uvrD303 could decrease SOS expression under all conditions, while recA4162 could decrease SOS expression under all conditions except in the polA strain or when DSBs occur. It is hypothesized that recA4162 suppresses SOS expression best when the ssDNA occurs at a gap and that uvrD303 is able to decrease SOS expression when the ssDNA is either at a gap or when it is generated at a DSB (but does so better at a gap).",

Previously, we demonstrated that NER-deficient mouse models Xpa\u2212/\u2212 and Xpc\u2212/\u2212 exhibit a divergent spontaneous tumor spectrum and proposed that XPC might be functionally involved in the defense against oxidative DNA damage. Others have mechanistically dissected several functionalities of XPC to oxidative DNA damage sensitivity using in vitro studies. XPC has been linked to regulation of base excision repair (BER) activity, redox homeostasis and recruitment of ATM and ATR to damage sites, thereby possibly regulating cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis. XPC has additionally been implicated in recognition of bulky (e.g. cyclopurines) and non-bulky DNA damage (8-oxodG). However, the ultimate contribution of the XPC functionality in vivo in the oxidative DNA damage response and subsequent mutagenesis process remains unclear. Our study indicates that Xpc\u2212/\u2212 mice, in contrary to Xpa\u2212/\u2212 and wild type mice, have an increased mutational load upon induction of oxidative stress and that mutations arise in a slowly accumulative fashion. The effect of non-functional XPC in vivo upon oxidative stress exposure appears to have implications in mutagenesis, which can contribute to the carcinogenesis process. The levels and rate of mutagenesis upon oxidative stress correlate with previous findings that lung tumors in Xpc\u2212/\u2212 mice overall arise late in the lifespan and that the incidence of internal tumors in XP-C patients is relatively low in comparison to skin cancer incidence.",

If UNG excises the dU, the abasic site could be cleaved by AP-endonuclease (APE), introducing the single-strand DNA breaks (SSBs) required for generating mutations at A:T bp, which are known to depend upon mismatch repair and DNA Pol \u03b7. DNA Pol \u03b2 or \u03bb could instead repair the lesion correctly. To assess the involvement of Pols \u03b2 and \u03bb in SHM of antibody genes, we analyzed mutations in the VDJh4 3\u2032 flanking region in Peyer's patch germinal center (GC) B cells from pol\u03b2\u2212/\u2212pol\u03bb\u2212/\u2212, pol\u03bb\u2212/\u2212, and pol\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 mice. We find that deficiency of either or both polymerases results in a modest but significant decrease in V region SHM, with Pol \u03b2 having a greater effect, but there is no effect on mutation specificity, suggesting they have no direct role in SHM. Instead, the effect on SHM appears to be due to a role for these enzymes in GC B cell proliferation or viability. The results suggest that the BER pathway is not important during V region SHM for generating mutations at A:T bp. Furthermore, this implies that most of the SSBs required for Pol \u03b7 to enter and create A:T mutations are likely generated during replication instead. These results contrast with the inhibitory effect of Pol \u03b2 on mutations at the Ig S\u03bc locus, S\u03bc DSBs and class switch recombination (CSR) reported previously. We show here that B cells deficient in Pol \u03bb or both Pol \u03b2 and \u03bb proliferate normally in culture and undergo slightly elevated CSR, as shown previously for Pol \u03b2-deficient B cells.",

The repair enzyme ogg1 initiates the highly conserved base-excision repair pathway. However, its function in the embryonic brain is largely unknown.This study is the first to validate the function of ogg1 during brain development using zebrafish embryos. Ogg1 was found to be highly expressed in the brain throughout early embryonic development, with particularly enrichment observed in the midbrain. The lack of ogg1 causes severe brain defects including changes in brain volume and integrity, destruction of the midbrain\u2013hindbrain boundary, and balance and motor impairment, while overexpression of ogg1 can partially rescue these defects.Multiple cellular and molecular events were involved in the manifestation of brain defects due primarily to the lack of ogg1. These included (1) increased apoptosis; (2) decreased proliferation; and (3) aberrant axon distribution and extension from the inner surface towards the outer layers. The results of a microarray analysis showed that the expression of genes involved in cell cycle checkpoint, apoptosis, and neurogenesis were significantly changed in response to ogg1 knockdown. Cmyb was the key downstream gene that responses to DNA damage caused by ogg1 deficiency. Notably, the recruitment of ogg1 mRNA can alleviate the effects on the brain due to neural DNA damage.In summary, we introduce here that ogg1 is fundamentally required for protecting the developing brain, which may be helpful in understanding the aetiology of congenital brain deficits.",

However, structural insights into this recruitment are currently limited. Sequence analysis of the first unstructured linker domain of XRCC1 identifies a segment consistent with a possible REV1 interacting region (X1RIR) motif. The X1RIR motif is present in translesion polymerases that can be recruited to the pol \u03b6/REV1 DNA repair complex via a specific interaction with the REV1 C-terminal domain. NMR and fluorescence titration studies were performed on XRCC1-derived peptides containing this putative RIR motif in order to evaluate the binding affinity for the REV1 C-terminal domain. These studies demonstrate an interaction of the XRCC1-derived peptide with the human REV1 C-terminal domain characterized by dissociation constants in the low micromolar range. Ligand competition studies comparing the XRCC1 RIR peptide with previously studied RIR peptides were found to be inconsistent with the NMR based Kd values. These discrepancies were resolved using a fluorescence assay for which the RIR\u2013REV1 system is particularly well suited. The structure of a REV1-XRCC1 peptide complex was determined by using NOE restraints to dock the unlabeled XRCC1 peptide with a labeled REV1 C-terminal domain. The structure is generally homologous with previously determined complexes with the pol \u03ba and pol \u03b7 RIR peptides, although the helical segment in XRCC1 is shorter than was observed in these cases. These studies suggest the possible involvement of XRCC1 and its associated repair factors in post replication repair.",

We propose that homologous recombination (HR), a major repair pathway for DNA double strand breaks, can prevent GCV-induced DNA damage, and that inhibition of HR will enhance cytotoxicity with GCV. Survival after GCV treatment in cells expressing a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase was strongly dependent on HR (>14-fold decrease in IC50 in HR-deficient vs. HR-proficient CHO cells). In a homologous recombination reporter assay, the histone deacetylase inhibitor, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat), decreased HR repair events up to 85%. SAHA plus GCV produced synergistic cytotoxicity in U251tk human glioblastoma cells. Elucidation of the synergistic mechanism demonstrated that SAHA produced a concentration-dependent decrease in the HR proteins Rad51 and CtIP. GCV alone produced numerous Rad51 foci, demonstrating activation of HR. However, the addition of SAHA blocked GCV-induced Rad51 foci formation completely and increased \u03b3H2AX, a marker of DNA double strand breaks. SAHA plus GCV also produced synergistic cytotoxicity in HR-proficient CHO cells, but the combination was antagonistic or additive in HR-deficient CHO cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that HR promotes survival with GCV and compromise of HR by SAHA results in synergistic cytotoxicity, revealing a new mechanism for enhancing anticancer activity with GCV.",

This PARP1-EJ is suggested to be active especially in tumor cells contributing to their genomic instability. Here, we define conditions under which cells would switch the repair to PARP1-EJ. Using the end jining repair substrate pEJ, we revealed that PARP1-EJ is solely used when Ku is deficient but not when either DNA-PKcs or Xrcc4 is lacking. In the latter case, DSB repair, however, could be shuttled to PARP1-EJ after additional Ku80 down-regulation, which partly rescued the DSB repair in these mutants. We demonstrate here that PARP-EJ may work on DSB ends at high fidelity manner, as evident from the unchanged efficiency upon blocking end resection by either roscovitin or mirin. Furthermore, we demonstrate for that PARP-EJ is likewise involved in the repair of multiple DSBs (I-PpoI- and IR-induced). Importantly, we identified a chromatin signature associated with the switch to PARP1-EJ which is characterized by a strong enrichment of both PARP1 and LigIII at damaged chromatin. Together, these data indicate that Ku is the main regulator for the hierarchal organization between C-NHEJ and PARP1-EJ.",

Recent reports suggest that activation of ATM and ATR are oppositely regulated by the length of single stranded overhangs generated during end processing by nucleases at the break sites. These stretches of single stranded overhangs hold the clue for the transition from ATM to ATR signaling at broken DNA ends. We investigated whether differential processing of breaks induced by low and high LET radiation augments the phenomenon of switching from ATM to ATR kinase and hence a concomitant NHEJ to HR transition at the sites of DNA damage. 82-6 human fibroblasts were irradiated with 1 or 2\u00a0Gy of \u03b3-rays and particle radiation of increasing LET in order to increase the complexity and variability of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) structures. The activation kinetics of ATM and ATR kinases along with their downstream substrates were determined utilizing Western blotting and immunofluorescence techniques. Our data provide evidence of a potential switch from ATM to ATR kinase signaling in cells treated with \u03b3-rays at approximately 2\u00a0h post irradiation, with induction and completion of resection denoted by Rad51 foci resolution kinetics and observed with a significant decline of phosphorylated ATR kinase 8\u00a0h after IR. On the other hand, irradiation with high LET 600\u00a0MeV/u 56Fe (180\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) and 170\u00a0MeV/u 28Si (99\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) particles show a similar Rad51 foci decay kinetics, however, exhibiting prolonged resection, evident by the persistent phosphorylated ATM and ATR kinase until 24\u00a0h post irradiation. This residual effect, however, was significantly reduced for 250\u00a0MeV/u 16O particles of moderate LET (25\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) and absent for \u03b3-rays. Hence, our results support the hypothesis that the transition from ATM to ATR signaling at DNA break sites is extended for longer periods of time, indicated by sustained resection due to the complex type of damage induced, a hallmark of high LET radiation, which may contribute to its increased biological effectiveness.",

Unlike NEIL1 and NEIL2, which possess a \u03b2,\u03b4-elimination activity, NEIL3 mainly incised damaged DNA by \u03b2-elimination. Further, the base excision and strand incision activities of NEIL3 exhibited a non-concerted action, indicating that NEIL3 mainly operate as a monofunctional DNA glycosylase. The site-specific NEIL3 mutant V2P, however, showed a concerted action, suggesting that the N-terminal amino group in Val2 is critical for the monofunctional modus.

We have discovered that POT1 exists in at least three consistently occurring forms; 90, 70 and 45\u00a0kDa. The unexpected molecular weights of POT1 seem to be associated with SUMO1 and ubiquitin conjugation; the latter occurring at a double lysine residue at 289-KK-290. We also present evidence that the relative abundance of the different POT1 forms can be altered by experimental modulation of POT1 nuclear localization.

     "abstract": "Abasic sites in genomic DNA can be a significant source of mutagenesis in biological systems, including human cancers. Such mutagenesis requires translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) bypass of the abasic site by specialized DNA polymerases. The abasic site bypass specificity of TLS proteins had been studied by multiple means in vivo and in vitro, although the generality of the conclusions reached have been uncertain. Here, we introduce a set of yeast reporter strains for investigating the in vivo specificity of abasic site bypass at numerous random positions within chromosomal DNA. When shifted to 37\u00a0\u00b0C, these strains underwent telomere uncapping and resection that exposed reporter genes within a long 3\u2032 ssDNA overhang. Human APOBEC3G cytosine deaminase was expressed to create uracils in ssDNA, which were excised by uracil-DNA N-glycosylase. During repair synthesis, error-prone TLS bypassed the resulting abasic sites. Because of APOBEC3G's strict motif specificity and the restriction of abasic site formation to only one DNA strand, this system provides complete information about the location of abasic sites that led to mutations. We recapitulated previous findings on the roles of REV1 and REV3. Further, we found that sequence context can strongly influence the relative frequency of A or C insertion. We also found that deletion of Pol32, a non-essential common subunit of Pols \u03b4 and \u03b6, resulted in residual low-frequency C insertion dependent on Rev1 catalysis. We summarize our results in a detailed model of the interplay between TLS components leading to error-prone bypass of abasic sites. Our results underscore the utility of this system for studying TLS bypass of many types of lesions within genomic DNA.",

We report here the isolation and biochemical characterization of a putative MBD4 homolog from Arabidopsis thaliana, designated as MBD4L (MBD4-like). The plant enzyme lacks the MBD domain present in mammalian MBD4 proteins, but conserves a DNA glycosylase domain with critical residues for substrate recognition and catalysis, and it is more closely related to MBD4 homologs than to other members of the HhH-GPD superfamily. Arabidopsis MBD4L excises uracil and thymine opposite G, and the presence of halogen substituents at C5 of the target base greatly increases its excision efficiency. No significant activity is detected on cytosine derivatives such as 5-methylcytosine or 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. The enzyme binds to the abasic site product generated after excision, which decreases its catalytic turnover in vitro. Both the full-length protein and a N-terminal truncated version retaining the catalytic domain exhibit a preference for a CpG sequence context, where most plant DNA methylation is found. Our results suggest that an important function of Arabidopsis MBD4L is to protect the plant genome from the mutagenic consequences of cytosine and 5-methylcytosine deamination.",

We exposed pregnant dams to DNA-damaging agents, conferring a variety of lesions at a specific time in embryo development. To monitor homologous recombination frequency, we used the well-established retinal pigment epithelium pink-eyed unstable assay. Homologous recombination resulting in the deletion of a duplicated 70\u00a0kb fragment in the coding region of the Oca2 gene renders this gene functional and can be visualized as a pigmented eyespot in the retinal pigment epithelium.

To better understand this process in human cells, we have reconstituted Okazaki fragment processing by the short flap pathway in vitro with purified human proteins and oligonucleotide substrates. We systematically characterized the key events in Okazaki fragment processing: the strand displacement, Pol \u03b4/Fen1 combined reactions for removal of the RNA/DNA primer, and the complete reaction with DNA ligase I. Two forms of human DNA polymerase \u03b4 were studied: Pol \u03b44 and Pol \u03b43, which represent the heterotetramer and the heterotrimer lacking the p12 subunit, respectively. Pol \u03b43 exhibits very limited strand displacement activity in contrast to Pol \u03b44, and stalls on encounter with a 5\u2032-blocking oligonucleotide. Pol \u03b44 and Pol \u03b43 exhibit different characteristics in the Pol \u03b4/Fen1 reactions. While Pol \u03b43 produces predominantly 1 and 2 nt cleavage products irrespective of Fen1 concentrations, Pol \u03b44 produces cleavage fragments of 1\u201310 nts at low Fen1 concentrations. Pol \u03b43 and Pol \u03b44 exhibit comparable formation of ligated products in the complete system. While both are capable of Okazaki fragment processing in vitro, Pol \u03b43 exhibits ideal characteristics for a role in Okazaki fragment processing. Pol \u03b43 readily idles and in combination with Fen1 produces primarily 1 nt cleavage products, so that nick translation predominates in the removal of the blocking strand, avoiding the production of longer flaps that require additional processing. These studies represent the first analysis of the two forms of human Pol \u03b4 in Okazaki fragment processing.

     "abstract": "DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation (IR) are deleterious damages. Two major pathways repair DSBs in human cells, DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR). It has been suggested that the balance between the two repair pathways varies depending on the chromatin structure surrounding the damage site and/or the complexity of damage at the DNA break ends. Heavy ion radiation is known to induce complex-type DSBs, and the efficiency of NHEJ in repairing these DSBs was shown to be diminished. Taking advantage of the ability of high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation to produce complex DSBs effectively, we investigated how the complexity of DSB end structure influences DNA damage responses. An early step in HR is the generation of 3\u2032-single strand DNA (SSD) via a process of DNA end resection that requires CtIP. To assess this process, we analyzed the level of phosphorylated CtIP, as well as RPA phosphorylation and focus formation, which occur on the exposed SSD. We show that complex DSBs efficiently activate DNA end resection. After heavy ion beam irradiation, resection signals appear both in the vicinity of heterochromatic areas, which is also observed after X-irradiation, and additionally in euchromatic areas. Consequently, \u223c85% of complex DSBs are subjected to resection in heavy ion particle tracks. Furthermore, around 20\u201340% of G1 cells exhibit resection signals. Taken together, our observations reveal that the complexity of DSB ends is a critical factor regulating the choice of DSB repair pathway and drastically alters the balance toward resection-mediated rejoining. As demonstrated here, studies on DNA damage responses induced by heavy ion radiation provide an important tool to shed light on mechanisms regulating DNA end resection.",

Although the DNA binding properties of XPC have been studied by several groups, there is a lack of consensus over whether XPC discriminates between DNA damaged by lesions associated with NER activity versus those that are not. In this study we report a high-throughput fluorescence anisotropy assay used to measure the DNA binding affinity of XPC for a panel of DNA substrates containing a range of chemical lesions in a common sequence. Our results demonstrate that while XPC displays a preference for binding damaged DNA, the identity of the lesion has little effect on the binding affinity of XPC.

Possibly, Pol \u025b mutations reduce the accuracy of DNA synthesis, thereby increasing the mutational burden and contributing to tumor development. To test this possibility in vivo, we characterized an active site mutant allele of human Pol \u025b that exhibits a strong mutator phenotype in vitro when the proofreading exonuclease activity of the enzyme is inactive. This mutant has a strong bias toward mispairs opposite template pyrimidine bases, particularly T\u2022dTTP mispairs. Expression of mutant Pol \u025b in human cells lacking functional mismatch repair caused an increase in mutation rate primarily due to T\u2022dTTP mispairs. Functional mismatch repair eliminated the increased mutagenesis. The results indicate that the mutant Pol \u025b causes replication errors in vivo, and is at least partially dominant over the endogenous, wild type Pol \u025b. Since tumors from familial and somatic colorectal patients arise with Pol \u025b mutations in a single allele, are microsatellite stable and have a large increase in base pair substitutions, our data are consistent with a Pol \u025b mutation requiring additional factors to promote tumor development.",

Most of these lesions are located within nucleosomes, which package DNA in chromatin and impede base excision repair (BER). We demonstrated previously that periodic, spontaneous partial unwrapping of DNA from the underlying histone octamer enables BER enzymes to bind to oxidative lesions that would otherwise be sterically inaccessible. In the present study, we asked if these periodic DNA unwrapping events are frequent enough to account for the estimated rates of BER in vivo. We measured rates of excision of oxidative lesions from sites in nucleosomes that are accessible only during unwrapping episodes. Using reaction conditions appropriate for presteady-state kinetic analyses, we derived lesion exposure rates for both 601 and 5S rDNA-based nucleosomes. Although DNA unwrapping-mediated exposure of a lesion \u223c16\u00a0NT from the nucleosome edge occurred \u223c7\u20138 times per minute, exposure rates fell dramatically for lesions located 10 or more NT further in from the nucleosome edge.

In contrast to C-NHEJ, A-NHEJ shows pronounced efficiency fluctuations throughout the cell cycle and is severely compromised as cells cease proliferating and enter the plateau phase (Windhofer et al., 2007 [23]). The molecular mechanisms underpinning this response remain unknown but changes in chromatin structure are prime candidate-A-NHEJ-modulators. Since parameters beyond chromatin acetylation appear to determine A-NHEJ efficiency (Manova et al., 2012 [42], [76]), we study here the role of chromatin decondensation mediated either by treatment with 5\u2032-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (AzadC) or growth in hypotonic conditions, on A-NHEJ. We report that both treatments have no detectable effect on C-NHEJ but provoke, specifically for A-NHEJ, cell-growth-dependent effects. These results uncover for the first time a link between A-NHEJ and chromatin organization and provide means for understanding the regulatory mechanisms underpinning the growth-state dependency of A-NHEJ. A-NHEJ is implicated in the formation of chromosomal translocations and in chromosome fusions that underlie genomic instability and carcinogenesis. The observations reported here may therefore contribute to the development of drug-based A-NHEJ suppression-strategies aiming at optimizing cancer treatment outcomes and possibly also at suppressing carcinogenesis.",

We have set out to identify genes with highly conserved response patterns through meta-analysis of mRNA expression datasets collected during natural ageing and accelerated ageing caused by a Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER) defect in a diverse set of organs and tissues in mice, and from in vitro UV-induced DNA damage in a variety of murine cells. The identified set of genes that show similar expression patterns in response to organ ageing (accelerated and normal), and endogenously and exogenously induced DNA damage, consists of genes involved in anti-oxidant systems and includes the transcription factor Bach2 as one of the most consistent markers. BACH2 was originally identified as a partner of the small Maf proteins and antagonist of the NRF2 anti-oxidant defence pathway and has been implicated in B-cell differentiation and immune system homeostasis. Although BACH2 has never before been associated with UV-induced damage or ageing, it shows a strong downregulation in both conditions. We have characterized the dynamics of Bach2 expression in response to DNA damage and show that it is a highly sensitive responder to transcription-blocking DNA lesions. Gene expression profiling using Affymetrix microarray analysis after siRNA-mediated silencing of Bach2 identified cell cycle and transcription regulation as the most significantly altered processes consistent with a function as transcription factor affecting proliferation.",

In Escherichia coli, significant loss of viability during TLD requires the SOS replication-stress/DNA-damage response, specifically its role in inducing the inhibitor of cell division, SulA. An independent RecQ- and RecJ-dependent TLD pathway accounts for a similarly large additional component of TLD, and a third SOS- and RecQ/J-independent TLD pathway has also been observed. Although two groups have implicated the SOS-response in TLD, an SOS-deficient mutant strain from an earlier study was found to be sensitive to thymine deprivation. We performed whole-genome resequencing on that SOS-deficient strain and find that, compared with the SOS-proficient control strain, it contains five mutations in addition to the SOS-blocking lexA(Ind\u2212) mutation. One of the additional mutations, csrA, confers TLD sensitivity specifically in SOS-defective strains. We find that CsrA, a carbon storage regulator, reduces TLD in SOS- or SulA-defective cells, and that the increased TLD that occurs in csrA\u2212 SOS-defective cells is dependent on RecQ.

We show that, contrary to research in Escherichia coli, the Nucleotide Excision Repair pathway is not required to repair nitrofuran-induced DNA damage in mammalian cells. Instead, we show that inhibiting repair of single-strand DNA breaks with the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, Olaparib, enhances nitrofuran toxicity in melanoma and neuroblastoma cells. We propose that this is due to mammalian cells utilising Type 2 nitroreductases for nitrofuran activation producing Reactive Oxygen Species which cause DNA damage that is repaired by the Single Strand Break Repair and/or Base Excision Repair pathways, whereas in bacteria and trypanosomes, Type 1 nitroreductases are also utilised resulting in different DNA lesions. In addition we show that, consistent with Reactive Oxygen Species being formed upon nitrofuran activation and the ability of melanin to absorb Reactive Oxygen Species, production of melanin in melanoma cells offers some protection from NFN1- and hydrogen peroxide-induced toxicity. Our data suggest that combinations of Olaparib and nitrofuran compounds may be advantageous for the treatment of melanoma and neuroblastoma, but that the protection offered to melanoma cells by their melanin pigment must be taken into account.",

DNA repair activity is representative of this functional approach, being seen as a valuable biomarker related to cancer risk. Repair activity is evaluated by incubating a cell extract with a DNA substrate containing lesions specific for the DNA repair pathway of interest. Enzymic incision at the lesion sites can be measured by means of the comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis). The assay is particularly applicable for evaluation of base and nucleotide excision repair pathways (BER and NER). Substrate DNA containing oxidised purines gives a measure of BER, while UV-induced photolesions are the substrate for NER. While applications of comet-based DNA repair assays continue to increase, there are no commonly accepted standard protocols, which complicates inter-laboratory comparisons of results.Here we provide a comprehensive summary of protocols for the comet-based BER- and NER-specific in vitro DNA repair assays that can be applied to a wide spectrum of biological material \u2013 cultured cell lines, blood cells, animal tissue samples and human biopsies. Our intention is to provide a detailed and user-friendly account of the assays, including practical tips and recommendations to help in setting them up.

The cellular response to DSBs is orchestrated by signal transduction pathways, known as DNA damage checkpoints, which are conserved from yeasts to humans. These pathways can sense DNA damage and transduce this information to specific cellular targets, which in turn regulate cell cycle transitions and DNA repair. The mammalian protein kinases ATM and ATR, as well as their budding yeast corresponding orthologs Tel1 and Mec1, act as master regulators of the checkpoint response to DSBs.

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) sever entire chromosomes and pose a major threat to genome integrity as a result of chromosomal fragment loss or chromosomal rearrangements. Exogenous factors such as ionizing radiation, crosslinking agents, and topoisomerase poisons, contribute to break formation. DSBs are associated with oxidative metabolism, form during the normal S phase, when replication forks collapse and are generated during physiological processes such as V(D)J recombination, yeast mating type switching and meiosis. It is estimated that in mammalian cells \u223c10 DSBs per cell are formed daily. If left unrepaired DSBs can lead to cell death or deregulated growth, and cancer development. Cellular response to DSB damage includes mechanisms to halt the progression of the cell cycle and to restore the structure of the broken chromosome. Changes in chromatin adjacent to DNA break sites are instrumental to the DNA damage response (DDR) with two apparent ends: to control compaction and to bind repair and signaling molecules to the lesion. Here, we review the key findings related to each of these functions and examine their cross-talk.",

Pol\u03bc participates in the repair of spontaneous double strand breaks (DSB) by non homologous end-joining (NHEJ), and also in the V(D)J recombination process after programmed DSBs. Pol\u03bc plays this dual role due to its template-dependent and terminal transferase (template-independent) polymerization activities. In this study we evaluated if Pol\u03bc could be regulated by Cdk phosphorylation along the cell cycle. In vitro kinase assays showed that the S phase-associated Cdk2/cyclin A complex was able to phosphorylate Pol\u03bc. We identified Ser12, Thr21 (located in the BRCT domain) and Ser372 (located in loop1) as the target residues. Mutation of these residues to alanine indicated that Ser372 is the main phosphorylation site. Mobilization of loop1, which mediates DNA end micro-synapsis, is crucial both for terminal transferase and NHEJ. Interestingly, the phospho-mimicking S372E mutation specifically impaired these activities. Our evidences suggest that Pol\u03bc could be regulated in vivo by phosphorylation of the BRCT domain (Ser12/Thr21) and of Ser372, affecting the function of loop1. Consequently, Pol\u03bc\u2019s most distinctive activities would be turned off at specific cell-cycle phases (S and G2), when these promiscuous functions might be harmful to the cell.",

Our recent studies have shown that OGG1 binds its repair product 8-oxoG base with high affinity at a site independent from its DNA lesion-recognizing catalytic site and the OGG1\u20228-oxoG complex physically interacts with canonical Ras family members. Furthermore, exogenously added 8-oxoG base enters the cells and activates Ras GTPases; however, a link has not yet been established between cell signaling and DNA BER, which is the endogenous source of the 8-oxoG base. In this study, we utilized KG-1 cells expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant OGG1, siRNA ablation of gene expression, and a variety of molecular biological assays to define a link between OGG1-BER and cellular signaling. The results show that due to activation of OGG1-BER, 8-oxoG base is released from the genome in sufficient quantities for activation of Ras GTPase and resulting in phosphorylation of the downstream Ras targets Raf1, MEK1,2 and ERK1,2.

Inactivation of the ubiquitous DNA mismatch repair pathway, whose normal function is to correct replication errors and hence increase replication fidelity, is often the cause of the mutator phenotype. One of the essential genes in this pathway, mutL, includes a short tandem repeat that is prone to polymerase slippage during replication. While extensive work has established that this repetitive sequence is a genuine genetic switch, the mechanism of MutL inactivation remains unclear. This short tandem repeat is translated into a LALALA motif that resides near the ATPase active site of MutL. Therefore, changes in the length of this motif are presumed to alter the ATPase activity of MutL. We have engineered variants of Escherichia coli MutL with shorter/longer LALALA motifs and characterized their ATPase and DNA binding functions. We have found that the deletion or insertion of a single LA repeat did not compromise the structural integrity of the protein, nor did it affect MutS- or DNA-binding activity. However, it severely compromised ATP binding and, consequently, engagement of the N-terminal domains; both essential activities for proper DNA mismatch repair.

To address the issues leading to this inconsistency, we explored possible shortcomings with existing methods and developed a sensitive LC/MS/MS-based method for the absolute quantification of genomic 2\u2032-deoxyuridine (dUrd). To this end, DNA was enzymatically hydrolyzed to 2\u2032-deoxyribonucleosides and dUrd was purified in a preparative HPLC step and analyzed by LC/MS/MS.

We quantified genomic dUrd in Ung+/+ and Ung\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts and human lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying UNG mutations.

Y-family polymerases make contacts with the minor groove side of the DNA substrate at the nascent base pair. The Y-family polymerases also contact the DNA major groove via the unique little finger domain, but they generally lack contacts with the major groove at the nascent base pair. Escherichia coli DinB efficiently and accurately copies certain minor groove guanosine adducts. In contrast, we previously showed that the presence in the DNA template of the major groove-modified base 1,3-diaza-2-oxophenothiazine (tC) inhibits the activity of E. coli DinB. Even when the DNA primer is extended up to three nucleotides beyond the site of the tC analog, DinB activity is strongly inhibited. These findings prompted us to investigate discrimination against other major groove modifications by DinB and its orthologs. We chose a set of pyrimidines and purines with modifications in the major groove and determined the activity of DinB and several orthologs with these substrates. DinB, human pol kappa, and Sulfolobus solfataricus Dpo4 show differing specificities for the major groove adducts pyrrolo-dC, dP, N6-furfuryl-dA, and etheno-dA. In general, DinB was least efficient for bypass of all of these major groove adducts, whereas Dpo4 was most efficient. DinB activity was essentially completely inhibited by the presence of etheno-dA, while pol kappa activity was strongly inhibited. All three of these DNA polymerases were able to bypass N6-furfuryl-dA with modest efficiency, with DinB being the least efficient. We also determined that the R35A variant of DinB enhances bypass of N6-furfuryl-dA but not etheno-dA.

We find in G1 arrested cells that histone H2A phosphorylation in response to ionizing radiation is independent of Sgs1 and Exo1. In contrast, these proteins are required for damage-induced recruitment of Rfa1 to the DSB sites, phosphorylation of the Rad53 effector kinase, cell cycle arrest and RNR3 expression. Checkpoint activation in G1 requires the catalytic activity of Sgs1, suggesting that it is DNA resection mediated by Sgs1 that stimulates the damage response pathway rather than protein\u2013protein interactions with other DDR proteins. Together, these results implicate DNA resection, which is thought to be minimal in G1, as necessary for activation of the G1 checkpoint.",

     "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) plays an important role in DNA repair, but also contributes to other aspects of nucleic acid metabolism, such as transcriptional regulation. Modification of PARP-1 with the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) affects its function as a transcriptional co-activator of hypoxia-responsive genes and promotes induction of the heat shock-induced HSP70.1 promoter. We now report that PARP-1 sumoylation is strongly influenced by DNA. Consistent with a function in transcription, we show that sumoylation in vitro is enhanced by binding to intact, but not to damaged DNA, in a manner clearly distinct from the mechanism by which DNA damage stimulates PARP-1's catalytic activity. An enhanced affinity of PARP-1 for the SUMO-conjugating enzyme Ubc9 upon binding to DNA is likely responsible for this effect. Sumoylation does not interfere with the catalytic or DNA-binding properties of PARP-1, and structural analysis reveals no significant impact of SUMO on the conformation of PARP-1's DNA-binding domain. In vivo, sumoylated PARP-1 is associated with chromatin, but the modification is not responsive to DNA damage and is not affected by PARP-1 catalytic activity. Our results suggest that PARP-1's alternative modes of DNA recognition serve as a means to differentiate between distinct aspects of the enzyme's function.",

PAR mediates recruitment and functions of the key BER factors XRCC1 and DNA polymerase \u03b2 (pol \u03b2) that in turn regulate PAR. Yet, the molecular mechanism and implications of coordination between XRCC1 and pol \u03b2 in regulating the level of PAR are poorly understood. A complex of PARP-1, XRCC1 and pol \u03b2 is found in vivo, and it is known that pol \u03b2 and XRCC1 interact through a redox-sensitive binding interface in the N-terminal domain of XRCC1. We confirmed here that both oxidized and reduced forms of XRCC1 are present in mouse fibroblasts. To further understand the importance of the C12\u2013C20 oxidized form of XRCC1 and the interaction with pol \u03b2, we characterized cell lines representing stable transfectants in Xrcc1\u2212/\u2212 mouse fibroblasts of wild-type XRCC1 and two mutants of XRCC1, a novel reduced form with the C12\u2013C20 disulfide bond blocked (C12A) and a reference mutant that is unable to bind pol \u03b2 (V88R). XRCC1-deficient mouse fibroblasts are extremely hypersensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and transfected wild-type and C12A mutant XRCC1 proteins similarly reversed MMS hypersensitivity. However, after MMS exposure the cellular PAR level was found to increase to a much greater extent in cells expressing the C12A mutant than in cells expressing wild-type XRCC1. PARP inhibition resulted in very strong MMS sensitization in cells expressing wild-type XRCC1, but this sensitization was much less in cells expressing the C12A mutant. The results suggest a role for the oxidized form of XRCC1 in the interaction with pol \u03b2 in (1) controlling the PAR level after MMS exposure and (2) enabling the extreme cytotoxicity of PARP inhibition during the MMS DNA damage response.",

Consequently, when members of this complex are disrupted, cells exhibit a mutator phenotype, sensitivity to DNA damage reagents and increased gross chromosomal rearrangements. Previously, we found that the Shu complex plays an important role in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) recombination when the Upstream Activating Factor (UAF) protein Uaf30 is disrupted. UAF30 encodes a protein needed for rDNA transcription and when deleted, rDNA recombination increases and the rDNA expands in a Shu1-dependent manner. Here we find using the uaf30-sensitized background that the central DNA repair protein Rad52, which is normally excluded from the nucleolus, frequently overlaps with the rDNA. This close association of Rad52 with the rDNA is dependent upon Shu1 in a uaf30 mutant. Previously, it was shown that in the absence of Rad52 sumoylation, Rad52 foci mislocalize to the nucleolus. Interestingly, here we find that using the uaf30 sensitized background the ability to regulate Rad52 sumoylation is important for Shu1 dependent rDNA recombination as well as Rad52 close association with rDNA. Our results suggest that in the absence of UAF30, the Shu complex plays a central role in Rad52 rDNA localization as long as Rad52 can be sumoylated. This discrimination is important for rDNA copy number homeostasis.",

Brain functionality is defined as the total input and output of the brain's neural circuits and networks. A given brain degenerative disorder does not deregulate total brain functionality but rather the activity of specific circuits in a given network, affecting their organization and topology, their cell numbers, their cellular functionality, and the interactions between neural circuits. Similarly, our concept of neurodegenerative diseases, which for many years revolved around neural survival or death, has now been extended to emphasize the role of glia. In particular, the role of glial cells in neuro-vascular communication is now known to be central to the effect of insults to the nervous system. In addition, a malfunctioning vascular system likely plays a role in the etiology of certain neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the symptoms of neurodegenerative or more correctly brain degenerative disease are, to a very large extent, a result of impairment in glial cells that lead to pathological neuro-vascular interactions that, in turn, generate a rather \u201chostile\u201d environment in which the neurons fail to function. These events lead to systematic neural cell death on a scale that appears to be proportional to the severity of the neurological deficit.",

Involvement of NER/TCR in these disorders is also substantiated by the evidence that aging constitutes the principal risk factor for chronic ND and that this DNA repair mechanism is very relevant for the aging process itself. Our understanding of the exact role of NER/TCR in chronic ND, however, is extremely rudimentary; while there is no doubt that defective NER/TCR can lead to neuronal death, evidence for its participation in the etiopathogenesis of ND is inconclusive thus far. Here we summarize the experimental observations supporting a role for NER/TCR in chronic ND and suggest questions and lines of investigation that might help in addressing this important issue.

Accumulation of this damage in the background of a functional DNA repair response is associated with normal aging, but defective repair in brain cells can contribute to neurological dysfunction.

The discovery of mutations in the ATM gene as being the underlying cause for A\u2013T and the demonstration that the ATM protein functions as a DNA damage-responsive kinase has defined current research focusing on decoding how the cell responds to genotoxic stress. Yet, despite significant advances in delineating the cellular DNA damage response pathways coordinated by ATM, very little headway has been made toward understanding how loss of ATM leads to progressive cerebellar ataxia and whether this can be attributed to an underlying defect in DNA double strand break repair (DSBR). Since its identification, A\u2013T has been used as the archetypal model for how a deficiency in DNA repair affects both the development and maintenance of the nervous and immune systems in humans as well as contributing to the process of tumourigenesis. However, following the growing availability and cost effectiveness of next generation sequencing technologies, the increasing recognition of novel human disorders associated with abnormal DNA repair has demonstrated that the neuropathology typified by A\u2013T is an \u2018exception\u2019 rather than the \u2018rule\u2019. As a consequence, this throws into doubt the longstanding hypothesis that the neurodegeneration seen in A\u2013T is due to the progressive loss of damaged neurons that have acquired toxic levels of unrepaired DNA lesions over time. Therefore, this review aims to address the question: Is defective DNA double strand break repair an underlying cause of neurodegeneration?",

ATM is now appreciated to play a role in vesicle dynamics as well as in the maintenance of the epigenetic code of histone modifications. Finally, the decline of ATM levels with age suggest that late onset neurodegenerative diseases may owe part of their pathogenesis to deficits in ATM signaling. Evidence from the location of HDAC4 in the hippocampal pyramidal cells of the Alzheimer's disease brain supports this hypothesis. These multiple functions of the ATM protein are in keeping with the complex multi-system nature of the symptoms of ataxia-telangiectasia and encourage us to look beyond DNA damage for the full understanding of the disease and its consequences.",

We have shown previously that a deletion of Mcph1 in mice results in microcephaly because of a premature switch from symmetric to asymmetric division of the neuroprogenitors, which is regulated by MCPH1's function in the centrosome. Because MCPH1 has been implicated in ATM and ATR-mediated DNA damage response (DDR) and defective DDR is often associated with neurodevelopmental diseases, we wonder whether the DDR-related function of MCPH1 prevents microcephaly. Here, we show that a deletion of Mcph1 results in a specific reduction of the cerebral cortex at birth, which is persistent through life. Due to an effect on premature neurogenic production, Mcph1-deficient progenitors give rise to a high level of early-born neurons that form deep layers (IV\u2013VI), while generate less late-born neurons that form a thinner outer layer (II\u2013III) of the cortex. However, neuronal migration seems to be unaffected by Mcph1 deletion. Ionizing radiation (IR) induces a massive apoptosis in the Mcph1-null neocortex and also embryonic lethality. Finally, Mcph1 deletion compromises homologous recombination repair and increases genomic instability. Altogether, our data suggest that MCPH1 ensures proper neuroprogenitor expansion and differentiation not only through its function in the centrosome, but also in the DDR.",

CS is typically considered to be a DNA repair disorder, since cells from CS patients have a defect in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). However, cells from UV-sensitive syndrome patients also lack TC-NER, but these patients do not suffer from the neurologic and other abnormalities that CS patients do. Also, the neurologic abnormalities that affect CS patients (CS neurologic disease) are qualitatively different from those seen in NER-deficient XP patients. Therefore, the TC-NER defect explains the sun sensitive phenotype common to both CS and UVsS, but cannot explain CS neurologic disease. However, as CS neurologic disease is of much greater clinical significance than the sun sensitivity, there is a pressing need to understand its molecular basis. While there is evidence for defective repair of oxidative DNA damage and mitochondrial abnormalities in CS cells, here I propose that the defects in transcription by both RNA polymerases I and II that have been documented in CS cells provide a better explanation for many of the severe growth and neurodevelopmental defects in CS patients than defective DNA repair.

Expansion causes disease when a particular base sequence is repeated beyond the normal range, interfering with the expression or properties of a gene product. Disease severity and onset depend on the number of repeats. As the length of the repeat tract grows, so does the size of the successive expansions and the likelihood of another unstable event. In fragile X syndrome, for example, CGG repeat instability and pathogenesis are not typically observed below tracts of roughly 50 repeats, but occur frequently at or above 55 repeats, and are virtually certain above 100\u2013300 repeats.Recent evidence points to bidirectional transcription as a new aspect of TNR instability and pathophysiology. Bidirectional transcription of TNR genes produces novel proteins and/or regulatory RNAs that influence both toxicity and epigenetic changes in TNR promoters. Bidirectional transcription of the TNR tract appears to influence aspects of its stability, gene processing, splicing, gene silencing, and chemical modification of DNAs. Paradoxically, however, some of the same effects are observed on both the expanded TNR gene and on its normal gene counterpart. In this review, we discuss the possible normal and abnormal effects of bidirectional transcription on trinucleotide repeat instability, the role of DNA repair in causing, preventing, or maintaining methylation, and chromatin environment of TNR genes.",

Hence, while CNS and PNS neurons cope with many similar challenges inherent to their high oxygen consumption and vigorous metabolism, PNS neurons are also exposed to circulating toxins and inflammatory mediators due to relative permeability of PNS blood nerve barrier (BNB). Consequently, genomes of PNS neurons incur greater damage and the question awaiting investigation is whether specialized repair mechanisms for maintenance of DNA integrity have evolved to meet the additional needs of PNS neurons. Here, I review data showing how PNS neurons manage collateral DNA damage incurred in the course of different anti-cancer treatments designed to block DNA replication in proliferating tumor cells. Importantly, while PNS neurotoxicity and concomitant chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) are among major dose limiting barriers in achieving therapy goals, CIPN is partially reversible during post-treatment nerve recovery. Clearly, cell recovery necessitates mobilization of the DNA damage response and underscores the need for systematic investigation of the scope of DNA repair capacities in the PNS to help predict post-treatment risks to recovering neurons.",

Protein arginine methylation is a covalent modification that results in the addition of methyl groups to the nitrogen atoms of the arginine side chains and is catalyzed by a family of protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs). In the past, arginine methylation was mainly observed on abundant proteins such as RNA-binding proteins and histones, but recent advances have revealed a plethora of arginine methylated proteins implicated in a variety of cellular processes including RNA metabolism, epigenetic regulation and DNA repair pathways. Herein, we discuss these recent advances, focusing on the role of PRMTs in DNA damage signaling and its importance for maintaining genomic stability.",

However, because several key repair proteins in mammals are missing from the well-studied budding and fission yeast, their roles at telomeres cannot be modeled in standard fungi. In this report, we explored the dimorphic fungus Ustilago maydis as an alternative model for telomere research. This fungus, which belongs to the phylum Basidiomycota, has a telomere repeat unit that is identical to the mammalian repeat, as well as a constellation of DNA repair proteins that more closely mimic the mammalian collection. We showed that the two core components of homology-directed repair (HDR) in U. maydis, namely Brh2 and Rad51, both promote telomere maintenance in telomerase positive cells, just like in mammals. In addition, we found that Brh2 is localized to telomeres in vivo, suggesting that it acts directly at chromosome ends. We surveyed a series of mutants with DNA repair defects, and found many of them to have short telomeres. Our results indicate that factors involved in DNA repair are probably also needed for optimal telomere maintenance in U. maydis, and that this fungus is a useful alternative model system for telomere research.",

     "abstract": "Double-strand breaks (DSBs), a common type of DNA lesion, occur daily in human cells as a result of both endogenous and exogenous damaging agents. DSBs are repaired in two general ways: by the homology-dependent, error-free pathways of homologous recombination (HR) and by the homology-independent, error-prone pathways of nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), with NHEJ predominating in most cells. DSBs with compatible ends can be re-joined in vitro with DNA ligase alone, which raises the question of whether such DSBs require the more elaborate machinery of NHEJ to be repaired in cells. Here we report that chromosomal DSBs with compatible ends introduced by the rare-cutting endonuclease, ISceI, are repaired by precise ligation nearly 100% of the time in human cells. Precise ligation depends on the classical NHEJ components Ku70, XRCC4, and DNA ligase IV, since siRNA knockdowns of these factors significantly reduced the efficiency of precise ligation. Interestingly, knockdown of the tumor suppressors p53 or BRCA1 showed similar effects as the knockdowns of NHEJ factors. In contrast, knockdown of components involved in alternative NHEJ, mismatch repair, nucleotide excision repair, and single-strand break repair did not reduce precise ligation. In summary, our results demonstrate that DSBs in human cells are efficiently repaired by precise ligation, which requires classical NHEJ components and is enhanced by p53 and BRCA1.",

     "abstract": "Considerable progress has been made recently toward understanding the processes of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and repair. However, a paucity of information still exists regarding the physiological effects of persistent mtDNA damage. This is due, in part, to experimental difficulties associated with targeting mtDNA for damage, while sparing nuclear DNA. Here, we characterize two systems designed for targeted mtDNA damage based on the inducible (Tet-ON) mitochondrial expression of the bacterial enzyme, exonuclease III, and the human enzyme, uracil-N-glyosylase containing the Y147A mutation. In both systems, damage was accompanied by degradation of mtDNA, which was detectable by 6\u00a0h after induction of mutant uracil-N-glycosylase and by 12\u00a0h after induction of exoIII. Unexpectedly, increases in the steady-state levels of single-strand lesions, which led to degradation, were small in absolute terms indicating that both abasic sites and single-strand gaps may be poorly tolerated in mtDNA. mtDNA degradation was accompanied by the loss of expression of mtDNA-encoded COX2. After withdrawal of the inducer, recovery from mtDNA depletion occurred faster in the system expressing exonuclease III, but in both systems reduced mtDNA levels persisted longer than 144\u00a0h after doxycycline withdrawal. mtDNA degradation was followed by reduction and loss of respiration, decreased membrane potential, reduced cell viability, reduced intrinsic reactive oxygen species production, slowed proliferation, and changes in mitochondrial morphology (fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, rounding and \u201cfoaming\u201d of the mitochondria). The mutagenic effects of abasic sites in mtDNA were low, which indicates that damaged mtDNA molecules may be degraded if not rapidly repaired. This study establishes, for the first time, that mtDNA degradation can be a direct and immediate consequence of persistent mtDNA damage and that increased ROS production is not an invariant consequence of mtDNA damage.",

Although several genes are known to be involved in the progression to blastic phase, molecular mechanisms for the evolution toward blast crisis have not been fully identified. Oncogenic stimuli enforce cell proliferation, which requires DNA replication. Unscheduled DNA replication enforced by oncogenic stimuli leads to double strand breaks on DNA. We found the DNA damage-response pathway is activated in bone marrow of chronic-phase CML patients possibly due to an enforced proliferation signal by BCR-ABL expression. Since ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a central player of the DNA damage-response pathway, we studied whether loss of this pathway accelerates blast crisis. We crossed Atm-knockout mice with BCR-ABL transgenic mice to test this hypothesis. Interestingly, the loss of one of the Atm alleles was shown to be enough for the acceleration of the blast crisis, which is supported by the finding of increased genomic instability as assayed by breakage\u2013fusion\u2013bridge (BFB) cycle formation. In light of these findings, the DNA damage-response pathway plays a vital role for determination of susceptibility to blast crisis in CML.",

Total RNA extraction from CD4+ lymphocytes was done at four different post-irradiation times. After mRNA amplification, aRNAs were hybridized on DNA microarrays.The results indicated that up-regulation was twice than down-regulation. Surprisingly, the number of modulated genes does not seem to change drastically with dose, even at the lowest dose of 5\u00a0mGy. Clustering analysis revealed seven gene expression clusters with different dose dependence profiles. The functional analysis showed that the genes which increased their expression with the dose were related to p53 pathway and DNA damage response. This could be observed from 25\u00a0mGy, but became very clear at doses equal or greater than 100\u00a0mGy. On the other hand, genes with a constant modulation of their expression in all the tested doses were related to cellular respiration, ATP metabolic process and chromatin organization. These latter molecular mechanisms seem to be triggered at very low doses (5\u201325\u00a0mGy). In silico promoter analysis seems to confirm the implication of transcription factors related to the pathways mentioned above.",

Characterizing the metabolic roles of RECQL4 and WRN in telomere maintenance is crucial in understanding the pathogenesis of their associated disorders. We have previously shown that WRN and RECQL4 display a preference in vitro to unwind telomeric DNA substrates containing the oxidative lesion 8-oxoguanine. Here, we show that RECQL4 helicase has a preferential activity in vitro on telomeric substrates containing thymine glycol, a critical lesion that blocks DNA metabolism, and can be modestly stimulated further on a D-loop structure by TRF2, a telomeric shelterin protein. Unlike that reported for telomeric D-loops containing 8-oxoguanine, RECQL4 does not cooperate with WRN to unwind telomeric D-loops with thymine glycol, suggesting RECQL4 helicase is selective for the type of oxidative lesion. RECQL4's function at the telomere is not yet understood, and our findings suggest a novel role for RECQL4 in the repair of thymine glycol lesions to promote efficient telomeric maintenance.",

To further investigate the differences and similarities of DSB- and nick-induced repair, we used an integrated reporter system in human cells to measure HR and NHEJ produced by the homing endonuclease I-AniI and a designed \u2018nickase\u2019 variant that nicks the same target site, focusing on the PARP and HR repair pathways. PARP inhibitors, which block single-strand break repair, increased the rate of nick-induced HR up to 1.7-fold but did not affect DSB-induced HR or mutNHEJ. Additionally, expression of the PALB2 WD40 domain in trans acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor of both DSB- and nick-induced HR, sensitized cells to PARP inhibition, and revealed an alternative mutagenic repair pathway for nicks. Thus, while both DSB- and nick-induced HR use a common pathway, their substrates are differentially processed by cellular factors. These results also suggest that the synthetic lethality of PARP and BRCA may be due to repair of nicks through an error prone, NHEJ-like mechanism that is active when both PARP and HR pathways are blocked.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which serve as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes, including the DNA damage response (DDR). However, little is known about whether miRNAs might influence sensitivity to PARP inhibitors. To investigate this, we performed a high throughput miRNA mimetic screen, which identified several miRNAs whose over-expression results in sensitization to the clinical PARP inhibitor olaparib. In particular, our findings indicate that hsa-miR-107 and hsa-miR-222 regulate the DDR and sensitise tumour cells to olaparib by repressing expression of RAD51, thus impairing DSB repair by HR. Moreover, elevated expression of hsa-miR-107 has been observed in a subset of ovarian clear cell carcinomas, which correlates with PARP inhibitor sensitivity and reduced RAD51 expression. Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that these miRNAs could be used as biomarkers to identify patients that may benefit from treatment with PARP inhibitors.",

To assess the potential of these enzymes for facilitating resolution of damaged ends during double-strand break rejoining, substrates bearing a variety of normal and structurally modified 3\u2032 overhangs were constructed, and treated either with Metnase or with Artemis plus DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Unlike Artemis, which trims long overhangs to 4\u20135 bases, cleavage by Metnase was more evenly distributed over the length of the overhang, but with significant sequence dependence. In many substrates, Metnase also induced marked cleavage in the double-stranded region within a few bases of the overhang. Like Artemis, Metnase efficiently trimmed overhangs terminated in 3\u2032-phosphoglycolates (PGs), and in some cases the presence of 3\u2032-PG stimulated cleavage and altered its specificity. The nonplanar base thymine glycol in a 3\u2032 overhang severely inhibited cleavage by Metnase in the vicinity of the modified base, while Artemis was less affected. Nevertheless, thymine glycol moieties could be removed by Metnase- or Artemis-mediated cleavage at sites farther from the terminus than the lesion itself. In in vitro end-joining systems based on human cell extracts, addition of Artemis, but not Metnase, effected robust trimming of an unligatable 3\u2032-PG overhang, resulting in a dramatic stimulation of ligase IV- and XLF-dependent end joining. Thus, while both Metnase and Artemis are biochemically capable of resolving a variety of damaged DNA ends for the repair of complex double-strand breaks, Artemis appears to act more efficiently in the context of other nonhomologous end joining proteins.",

It is a DNA-damaging agent that induces apoptosis of rapidly proliferating cells, an important factor underlying its therapeutic efficacy. Unfortunately, cellular resistance occurs often. A large fraction of tumor cells harbor mutations in p53, contributing to defects in apoptotic pathways and drug resistance. However, cisplatin-induced apoptosis can also occur in p53 deficient cells; thus, elucidation of the molecular mechanism involved will potentially yield new strategies to eliminate tumors that have defects in the p53 pathway. Most of the studies in this field have been conducted in cultured mammalian cells, not amenable to systematic genetic manipulation. Therefore, we aimed to establish a simplified model devoid of a p53 ortholog to study cisplatin-induced programmed cell death (PCD), using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Our results indicate cisplatin induces an active form of cell death in yeast, as this process was partially dependent on de novo protein synthesis and did not lead to loss of membrane integrity. Cisplatin also increased DNA condensation and fragmentation/degradation, but no significant mitochondrial dysfunction other than partial fragmentation. Co-incubation with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 increased resistance to cisplatin and, accordingly, yeast strains deficient in proteasome activity were more resistant to cisplatin than wild-type strains. Proteasome inhibitors can sensitize tumor cells to cisplatin, but protect others from cisplatin-induced cell death. Our results indicate inhibition of the proteasome protects budding yeast from cisplatin-induced cell death and validate yeast as a model to study the role of the proteasome in cisplatin-induced PCD. Elucidation of this mechanism will aid in the development of new strategies to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy.",

The deoxyuridine residues were converted into abasic sites by treatment with UDG enzyme creating an abasic clustered damage site in a precise position in each of the single strand of the DNA duplex. This oligomer duplex having compatible cohesive ends was ligated to pUC19 plasmid, linearized with HindIII restriction endonuclease. The plasmid\u2013oligomer conjugate was transformed into condensates by treating them with spermidine. The efficiency of strand cleavage action of ApeI enzyme on the abasic sites was determined by denaturing PAGE after timed incubation of the oligomer duplex and the oligomer\u2013plasmid conjugate in presence and absence of spermidine. The efficiency of double strand breaks was determined similarly by native PAGE. Quantitative gel analysis revealed that rate of abasic site cleavage is reduced in the DNA condensates as compared to the oligomer DNA duplex or the linear ligated oligomer\u2013plasmid conjugates. Generation of double strand break is significantly reduced also, suggesting that their creation is not proportionate to the number of abasic sites cleaved in the condensate model. All these suggest that the ApeI enzyme have difficulty to access the abasic sites located deep into the condensates leading to repair refractivity of the damages. In addition, we found that presence of a polyamine such as spermidine has no notable effect in the incision activity of ApeI enzyme in linear oligomer DNA duplexes in our experimental concentration.",

     "abstract": "Base excision repair (BER) is a major DNA repair pathway employed in mammalian cells that is required to maintain genome stability, thus preventing several human diseases, such as ageing, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. This is achieved through the repair of damaged DNA bases, sites of base loss and single strand breaks of varying complexity that are continuously induced endogenously or via exogenous mutagens. Whilst the enzymes involved in BER are now well known and characterised, the role of the co-ordination of BER enzymatic activities in the cellular response to DNA damage and the mechanisms regulating this process are only now being revealed. Post-translational modifications of BER proteins, including ubiquitylation and phosphorylation, are increasingly being identified as key processes that regulate BER. In this review we will summarise recent evidence discovering novel mechanisms that are involved in maintaining genome stability by regulation of the key BER proteins in response to DNA damage.",

We have identified a novel mutator strain yycJ in Bacillus anthracis. Mutations in the yycJ gene result in a spontaneous mutator phenotype with a mutational frequency and specificity comparable to that of MMR-deficient strains such as those with mutations in mutL or mutS. YycJ was annotated as a metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (M\u03b2L) super family member with unknown activity. In this study we carried out a biochemical characterization of YycJ and demonstrated that a recombinant YycJ protein possesses a 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonuclease activity at the 5\u2032 termini and at nicks of double-stranded DNA. This activity requires a divalent metal cofactor Mn2+ and is stimulated by 5\u2032-phosphate ends of duplex DNA. The mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues revealed that in addition to the five M\u03b2L family conserved motifs, YycJ appears to have its specific motifs that can be used to distinguish YycJ from other closely related M\u03b2L family members. A phylogenetic survey showed that putative YycJ homologs are present in several bacterial phyla as well as in members of the Methanomicrobiales and Thermoplasmales from Archaea. We propose that YycJ represents a new group of M\u03b2L fold exonucleases, which is likely to act in the recognition of MMR entry point and subsequent removal of the mismatched base in certain MutH-less bacterial species.",

We show that Tid1 ATPase activity is dispensable for its phosphorylation and for its recruitment near a DSB, but it is required to switch off Rad53 activation and for checkpoint adaptation. Mec1 and Rad53 kinases, together with Rad51 recombinase, are also implicated in the hyper-phosphorylation of the ATPase defective Tid1-K318R variant and in the efficient binding of the protein to the DSB site.In summary, Tid1 is a novel target of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway that is also involved in checkpoint adaptation.",

In yeasts the Smc5-6 complex is essential for proliferation and is involved in DNA repair and homologous recombination. siRNA depletion of genes involved in the Smc5-6 complex in cultured mammalian cells results in sensitivity to some DNA damaging agents. In order to gain further insight into its role in mammals we have generated mice mutated in the Smc6 gene. A complete knockout resulted in early embryonic lethality, demonstrating that this gene is essential in mammals. However, mutation of the highly conserved serine-994 to alanine in the ATP hydrolysis motif in the SMC6 C-terminal domain, resulted in mice with a surprisingly mild phenotype. With the neo gene selection marker in the intron following the mutation, resulting in reduced expression of the SMC6 gene, the mice were reduced in size, but fertile and had normal lifespans. When the neo gene was removed, the mice had normal size, but detailed phenotypic analysis revealed minor abnormalities in glucose tolerance, haematopoiesis, nociception and global gene expression patterns. Embryonic fibroblasts derived from the ser994 mutant mice were not sensitive to killing by a range of DNA damaging agents, but they were sensitive to the induction of sister chromatid exchanges induced by ultraviolet light or mitomycin C.

     "abstract": "Translesion synthesis (TLS), the process by which DNA polymerases replicate through DNA lesions, is the source of most DNA damage-induced mutations. Sometimes TLS is carried out by replicative polymerases that have evolved to synthesize DNA on non-damaged templates. Most of the time, however, TLS is carried out by specialized translesion polymerases that have evolved to synthesize DNA on damaged templates. TLS requires the mono-ubiquitylation of the replication accessory factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA and ubiquitin-modified PCNA (UbPCNA) stimulate TLS by replicative and translesion polymerases. Two mutant forms of PCNA, one with an E113G substitution and one with a G178S substitution, support normal cell growth but inhibit TLS thereby reducing mutagenesis in yeast. A re-examination of the structures of both mutant PCNA proteins revealed substantial disruptions of the subunit interface that forms the PCNA trimer. Both mutant proteins have reduced trimer stability with the G178S substitution causing a more severe defect. The mutant forms of PCNA and UbPCNA do not stimulate TLS of an abasic site by either replicative Pol \u03b4 or translesion Pol \u03b7. Normal replication by Pol \u03b7 was also impacted, but normal replication by Pol \u03b4 was much less affected. These findings support a model in which reduced trimer stability causes these mutant PCNA proteins to occasionally undergo conformational changes that compromise their ability to stimulate TLS by both replicative and translesion polymerases.",

In eukaryotes, MMR is initiated by the binding of heterodimeric MutS homologue (MSH) complexes, MSH2\u2013MSH6 and MSH2\u2013MSH3, which recognize and bind mismatches and unpaired nucleotides. Plants encode another mismatch recognition protein, named MSH7. MSH7 forms a heterodimer with MSH2 and the protein complex is designated MutS\u03b3. We here report the effect the expression of Arabidopsis MSH2 and MSH7 alone or in combination exert on the genomic stability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. AtMSH2 and AtMutS\u03b3 proteins failed to complement the hypermutator phenotype of an msh2 deficient strain. However, overexpressing AtMutS\u03b3 in MMR proficient strains generated a 4-fold increase in CAN1 forward mutation rate, when compared to wild-type strains. Canr mutation spectrum analysis of AtMutS\u03b3 overproducing strains revealed a substantial increase in the frequency of base substitution mutations, including an increased accumulation of base pair changes from G:C to A:T and T:A to C:G, G:C or A:T.

Using a tagged PprA protein and immunofluorescence microscopy, we show that PprA is recruited onto the nucleoid after \u03b3-irradiation before DNA double strand break repair completion, and then is found as a thread across the septum in dividing cells. Moreover, whereas untreated cells devoid of PprA displayed a wild type morphology, they showed a characteristic cell division abnormality after irradiation not found in other radiosensitive mutants committed to die, as DNA is present equally in the two daughter cells but not separated at the division septum.

ATR and ATM physically interacted with XPC and promptly localized to the UV damage sites. ATR and ATM recruitment and their phosphorylation were negatively affected in cells defective in DDB2 or XPC functions. Consequently, the phosphorylation of ATR and ATM substrates, Chk1, Chk2, H2AX, and BRCA1 was significantly reduced or abrogated in mutant cells. Furthermore, UV exposure of cells defective in DDB2 or XPC resulted in a marked decrease in BRCA1 and Rad51 recruitment to the damage site. Conversely, ATR- and ATM-deficiency failed to affect the recruitment of DDB2 and XPC to the damage site, and therefore did not influence the NER efficiency.

Here we use immunofluorescence to show that AAG localizes to mitochondria, and we find that native AAG is present in purified human mitochondrial extracts, as well as that exposure to alkylating agent promotes AAG accumulation in the mitochondria. We identify mitochondrial single-stranded binding protein (mtSSB) as a novel interacting partner of AAG; interaction between mtSSB and AAG is direct and increases upon methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment. The consequence of this interaction is specific inhibition of AAG glycosylase activity in the context of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but not a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) substrate. By inhibiting AAG-initiated processing of damaged bases, mtSSB potentially prevents formation of DNA breaks in ssDNA, ensuring that base removal primarily occurs in dsDNA.

However, it is not known whether endogenous RNA is repaired in vivo by repair proteins present at physiological concentrations. The concept of RNA repair as a biologically relevant process has therefore remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate AlkB-mediated repair of endogenous RNA in vivo by measuring differences in lesion-accumulation in two independent AlkB-proficient and deficient E. coli strains during exposure to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Repair was observed both in AlkB-overproducing strains and in the wild-type strains after AlkB induction. RNA repair appeared to be highest in RNA species below 200 nucleotides in size, mainly comprising tRNAs. Strikingly, at least 10-fold more lesions were repaired in RNA than in DNA. This may be a consequence of some 30-fold higher levels of aberrant methylation in RNA than in DNA after exposure to MMS. A high primary kinetic isotope effect (>10) was measured using a deuterated methylated RNA substrate, D3-1me(rA), demonstrating that it is the catalytic step, and not the search step that is rate-limiting.

Phylogenetic analysis of related proteins from four Schizosaccharomyces and other fungal species shows that the Mag1/Mag2 duplication is unique to the genus Schizosaccharomyces and most likely occurred in its ancestor. Mag1 excises N3- and N7-alkylguanines and 1,N6-ethenoadenine from DNA, whereas Mag2 has been reported to have no detectible alkylpurine base excision activity despite high sequence and active site similarity to Mag1. To understand this discrepancy we determined the crystal structure of Mag2 bound to abasic DNA and compared it to our previously determined Mag1\u2013DNA structure. In contrast to Mag1, Mag2 does not flip the abasic moiety into the active site or stabilize the DNA strand 5\u2032 to the lesion, suggesting that it is incapable of forming a catalytically competent protein\u2013DNA complex. Subtle differences in Mag1 and Mag2 interactions with the DNA duplex illustrate how Mag2 can stall at damage sites without fully engaging the lesion. We tested our structural predictions by mutational analysis of base excision and found a single amino acid responsible at least in part for Mag2's lack of activity. Substitution of Mag2 Asp56, which caps the helix at the base of the DNA intercalation loop, with the corresponding serine residue in Mag1 endows Mag2 with \u025bA excision activity comparable to Mag1. This work provides novel insight into the chemical and physical determinants by which the HhH glycosylases engage DNA in a catalytically productive manner.",

Top1 activity in yeast is a major source of transcription-associated mutagenesis, generating a distinctive mutation signature characterized by deletions in short, tandem repeats. A similar signature is associated with the persistence of ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) in DNA, and it also depends on Top1 activity. There is only partial overlap, however, between Top1-dependent deletion hotspots identified in highly transcribed DNA and those associated with rNMPs, suggesting the existence of both rNMP-dependent and rNMP-independent events. Here, we present genetic studies confirming that there are two distinct types of hotspots. Data suggest a novel model in which rNMP-dependent hotspots are generated by sequential Top1 reactions and are consistent with rNMP-independent hotspots reflecting processing of a trapped Top1 cleavage complex.",

At damaged telomeres, Saccharomyces cerevisiae RPA recruits the Mec1\u2013Ddc2 module of the DNA damage checkpoint network, its only known function in DNA damage signaling. Here, we describe rfa1 mutants (rfa1-1, rfa1-9, rfa1-10, rfa1-11 and rfa1-12) that are proficient in this checkpoint but nevertheless exhibit deregulation of cell cycle control upon telomere uncapping induced by the cdc13-1 mutation. Overriding of this damage-induced checkpoint-independent cell cycle block in the rfa1 mutants was suppressed following genetic inactivation of either TEL1 or EST2/telomerase. Altogether, our results suggest that a previously non-suspected function of RPA is to block cell cycle progression upon telomere uncapping using a yet unidentified pathway that functions in a Mec1\u2013Ddc2-independent manner. We propose that in the rfa1 mutants, ill-masking of uncapped telomeres provokes inappropriate access of Tel1 and inappropriate functioning of telomerase, which, by yet unknown mechanisms, allows cell division to take place in spite of the block established by the DNA damage checkpoint. In the present study, we also observed that upon telomere uncapping, rfa1-12, but not the other studied rfa1 mutants, triggered telomeric recombination in the presence of functional telomerase. In conclusion, the present study identifies a novel pathway of telomere end protection that utilizes a previously unsuspected function of RPA at the telomeres.",

     "abstract": "Inhibition of DNA repair has been proposed as a mechanism underlying heat-induced sensitization of tumour cells to some anticancer treatments. Base excision repair (BER) constitutes the main pathway for the repair of DNA lesions induced by oxidizing or alkylating agents. Here, we report that mild hyperthermia, without toxic consequences per se, affects cellular DNA glycosylase activities, thus impairing BER. Exposure of cells to mild hyperthermia leads to a rapid and selective inactivation of OGG1 (8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase) associated with the relocalisation of the protein into a detergent-resistant cellular fraction. Following its inactivation, OGG1 is ubiquitinated and directed to proteasome-mediated degradation, through a CHIP (C-terminus of HSC70-interacting protein) E3 ligase-mediated process. Moreover, the residual OGG1 accumulates in the perinuclear region leading to further depletion from the nucleus. As a consequence, HeLa cells subjected to hyperthermia and exposed to a genotoxic treatment have a reduced capacity to repair OGG1 cognate base lesions and an enhanced cell growth defect. The partial alleviation of this response by OGG1 overexpression indicates that heat-induced glycosylase inactivation contributes to the synergistic effect of hyperthermia on genotoxic treatments. Taken together, our results suggest that OGG1 inhibition contributes to heat-induced chemosensitisation of cells and could lay the basis for new anticancer therapeutic protocols that include hyperthermia.",

Deleting EXO1 was previously shown to increase mutation rates to a greater extent when combined with a mutator variant (pol3-L612M) of the lagging strand replicase, DNA polymerase \u03b4 (Pol \u03b4), than when combined with a mutator variant (pol2-M644G) of the leading strand replicase, DNA polymerase \u025b (Pol \u025b). Here we confirm that result, and extend the approach to examine the effect of deleting EXO1 in a mutator variant (pol1-L868M) of Pol \u03b1, the proofreading-deficient and least accurate of the three nuclear replicases that is responsible for initiating Okazaki fragment synthesis. We find that deleting EXO1 increases the mutation rate in the Pol \u03b1 mutator strain to a significantly greater extent than in the Pol \u03b4 or Pol \u025b mutator strains, thereby preferentially reducing the efficiency of MMR of replication errors generated by Pol \u03b1. Because these mismatches are closer to the 5\u2032 ends of Okazaki fragments than are mismatches made by Pol \u03b4 or Pol \u025b, the results not only support the previous suggestion that Exo1 preferentially excises lagging strand replication errors during mismatch repair, they further imply that the 5\u2032 ends serve as entry points for 5\u2032 excision of replication errors made by Pol \u03b1, and possibly as strand discrimination signals for MMR. Nonetheless, mutation rates in the Pol \u03b1 mutator strain are 5- to 25-fold lower in an exo1\u0394 strain as compared to an msh2\u0394 strain completely lacking MMR, indicating that in the absence of Exo1, most replication errors made by Pol \u03b1 can still be removed in an Msh2-dependent manner by other nucleases and/or by strand displacement.",

Mismatch repair is also implicated in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis after DNA damage. Because yeast and human mismatch repair systems are well conserved, we have employed the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to understand the regulation and function of the mismatch repair gene MSH2. Using a luciferase-based transcriptional reporter, we defined a 218-bp region upstream of MSH2 that contains cell-cycle and DNA damage responsive elements. The 5\u2032 end of the MSH2 transcript was mapped by primer extension and was found to encode a small upstream open reading frame (uORF). Mutagenesis of the uORF start codon or of the uORF stop codon, which creates a continuous reading frame with MSH2, increased Msh2 steady-state protein levels \u223c2-fold. Furthermore, we found that the cell-cycle transcription factors Swi6, Swi4, and Mbp1\u2014along with SCB/MCB cell-cycle binding sites upstream of MSH2\u2014are all required for full basal expression of MSH2. Mutagenesis of the cell-cycle boxes resulted in a minor reduction in basal Msh2 levels and a 3-fold defect in mismatch repair. Disruption of the cell-cycle boxes also affected growth in a DNA polymerase-defective strain background where mismatch repair is essential, particularly in the presence of the DNA damaging agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS). Promoter replacements conferring constitutive expression of MSH2 revealed that the transcriptional induction in response to MMS is required to maintain induced levels of Msh2. Turnover experiments confirmed an elevated rate of degradation in the presence of MMS. Taken together, the data show that the DNA damage regulation of Msh2 occurs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The transcriptional and translational control elements identified are conserved in mammalian cells, underscoring the use of yeast as a model system to examine the regulation of MSH2.",

They are subsequently removed by RNase H2-dependent repair, which if defective leads to replication stress and genome instability. To extend these studies to humans, where an RNase H2 defect results in an autoimmune disease, here we compare the ability of human and yeast Pol \u03b4 to incorporate, proofread, and bypass ribonucleotides during DNA synthesis. In reactions containing nucleotide concentrations estimated to be present in mammalian cells, human Pol \u03b4 stably incorporates one rNTP for approximately 2000 dNTPs, a ratio similar to that for yeast Pol \u03b4. This result predicts that human Pol \u03b4 may introduce more than a million ribonucleotides into the nuclear genome per replication cycle, an amount recently reported to be present in the genome of RNase H2-defective mouse cells. Consistent with such abundant stable incorporation, we show that the 3\u2032-exonuclease activity of yeast and human Pol \u03b4 largely fails to edit ribonucleotides during polymerization. We also show that, like yeast Pol \u03b4, human Pol \u03b4 pauses as it bypasses ribonucleotides in DNA templates, with four consecutive ribonucleotides in a DNA template being more problematic than single ribonucleotides. In conjunction with recent studies in yeast and mice, this ribonucleotide incorporation may be relevant to impaired development and disease when RNase H2 is defective in mammals. As one tool to investigate ribonucleotide incorporation by Pol \u03b4 in human cells, we show that human Pol \u03b4 containing a Leu606Met substitution in the polymerase active site incorporates 7-fold more ribonucleotides into DNA than does wild type Pol \u03b4.",

WRN but not BLM is required to support fork progression after HU. Resumption of replication by forks may be necessary but is not sufficient for timely completion of the cell cycle after HU arrest, as depletion of WRN or BLM compromises fork recovery to a similar degree, but only BLM depletion leads to extensive delay of cell division after HU, as well as more pronounced chromatin bridging. Finally, we show that recovery from HU includes apparent removal of some of the DNA that was synthesized immediately after release from HU, a novel phenomenon that we refer to as nascent strand processing, NSP.",

They enable the use of defined DNA ends as substrates for end-joining and the analysis by sequencing of the resulting junctions to identify the repair pathways engaged. Yet, plasmid assays have generated divergent results of end-joining capacity in the same DSB repair mutants when used under different conditions, which implies contributions from undefined and therefore uncontrolled parameters. To help standardize these assays, we searched for parameters underpinning these variations and identified transfection method as an important determinant. Here, we compare a lipid-based transfection method, lipofection, with an electroporation method, nucleofection, and find large, unanticipated and cell line-dependent differences in percent end-joining without recognizable trends. For example, in rodent cells, transfection using lipofection gives nearly WT end-joining in DNA-PKcs mutants and only mildly inhibited end-joining in Lig4 and Ku mutants. In contrast, transfection using nucleofection shows marked end-joining inhibition in all NHEJ mutants tested as compared to the WT. In human HCT116 cells, end-joining after nucleofection is strongly suppressed even in the WT and the differences to the mutants are small. After lipofection, in contrast, end-joining is high in WT cells and markedly suppressed in the mutants. We conclude that better understanding and control of the physicochemical/biological and analytical parameters underpinning these differences will be required to generate with plasmid assays results with quantitative power comparable to that of well-established methods of DSB analysis such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or \u03b3-H2AX foci scoring.

POLQ has been implicated by different experiments to play a role in resistance to ionizing radiation and defense against genomic instability, in base excision repair, and in immunological diversification. The protein is formed by an N-terminal helicase-like domain, a C-terminal DNA polymerase domain, and a large central domain that spans between the two. This arrangement is also found in the Drosophila Mus308 protein, which functions in resistance to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. Homologs of POLQ and Mus308 are found in multicellular eukaryotes, including plants, but a comparison of phenotypes suggests that not all of these genes are functional orthologs. Flies defective in Mus308 are sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, while mammalian cells defective in POLQ are primarily sensitive to DNA double-strand breaking agents. Cells from Polq\u2212/\u2212 mice are hypersensitive to radiation and peripheral blood cells display increased spontaneous and ionizing radiation-induced levels of micronuclei (a hallmark of gross chromosomal aberrations), though mice apparently develop normally. Loss of POLQ in human and mouse cells causes sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other double strand breaking agents and increased DNA damage signaling. Retrospective studies of clinical samples show that higher levels of POLQ gene expression in breast and colorectal cancer are correlated with poorer outcomes for patients. A clear understanding of the mechanism of action and physiologic function of POLQ in the cell is likely to bear clinical relevance.",

Our goal was to establish the role of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a common oxidatively damaged base, and its repair by 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (Ogg1) in allergic airway inflammatory processes. Airway inflammation was induced by intranasally administered ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) pollen grain extract (RWPE) in sensitized BALB/c mice. We utilized siRNA technology to deplete Ogg1 from airway epithelium; 8-oxoG and DNA strand break levels were quantified by Comet assays. Inflammatory cell infiltration and epithelial methaplasia were determined histologically, mucus and cytokines levels biochemically and enhanced pause was used as the main index of airway hyperresponsiveness. Decreased Ogg1 expression and thereby 8-oxoG repair in the airway epithelium conveyed a lower inflammatory response after RWPE challenge of sensitized mice, as determined by expression of Th2 cytokines, eosinophilia, epithelial methaplasia, and airway hyperresponsiveness. In contrast, 8-oxoG repair in Ogg1-proficient airway epithelium was coupled to an increase in DNA single-strand break (SSB) levels and exacerbation of allergen challenge-dependent inflammation. Decreased expression of the Nei-like glycosylases Neil1 and Neil2 that preferentially excise ring-opened purines and 5-hydroxyuracil, respectively, did not alter the above parameters of allergic immune responses to RWPE.

The Rev1 pathway constitutes the major mechanism of translesion synthesis and base damage-induced mutagenesis in model cell systems. Rev1 is a dCMP transferase, but additionally plays non-catalytic functions in translesion synthesis. Using the yeast model system, we attempted to gain further insights into the non-catalytic functions of Rev1. Rev1 stably interacts with Rad5 (a central component of the template switching pathway) via the C-terminal region of Rev1 and the N-terminal region of Rad5. Supporting functional significance of this interaction, both the Rev1 pathway and Rad5 are required for translesion synthesis and mutagenesis of 1,N6-ethenoadenine. Furthermore, disrupting the Rev1\u2013Rad5 interaction by mutating Rev1 did not affect its dCMP transferase, but led to inactivation of the Rev1 non-catalytic function in translesion synthesis of UV-induced DNA damage. Deletion analysis revealed that the C-terminal 21-amino acid sequence of Rev1 is uniquely required for its interaction with Rad5 and is essential for its non-catalytic function. Deletion analysis additionally implicated a C-terminal region of Rev1 in its negative regulation. These results show that a non-catalytic function of Rev1 in translesion synthesis and mutagenesis is mediated by its interaction with Rad5.",

     "abstract": "In S and G2 phase mammalian cells DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) can potentially be repaired by homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ). Results of several studies suggest that these two mechanistically distinct repair pathways can compete for DNA ends. Because HR and NHEJ differ with respect to error susceptibility, generation of chromosome rearrangements, which are potentially carcinogenic products of DSB repair, may depend on the pathway choice. To investigate this hypothesis, the influence of HR and NHEJ inhibition on the frequencies of chromosome aberrations in G2 phase cells was investigated. SW-1573 and RKO cells were treated with mild (41\u00a0\u00b0C) hyperthermia in order to disable HR and/or NU7441/cisplatin to inactivate NHEJ and frequencies of chromosomal fragments (resulting from unrepaired DSBs) and translocations (products of erroneous DSB rejoining) were studied using premature chromosome condensation (PCC) combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).It is shown here that temporary inhibition of HR by hyperthermia results in increased frequency of ionizing-radiation (IR)-induced chromosomal translocations and that this effect is abrogated by NU7441- or cisplatin-mediated inhibition of NHEJ. The results suggest that in the absence of HR, DSB repair is shifted to the error-prone NHEJ pathway resulting in increased frequencies of chromosomal rearrangements. These results might be of consequence for clinical cancer treatment approaches that aim at inhibition of one or more DSB repair pathways.",

In the genetic absence of MMR, certain tissues are predisposed to mutations and cancer. MMR proteins are involved in various functions including protection from replication-associated and non-mitotic mutations, as well as driving programmed and deleterious mutations, including disease-causing trinucleotide repeat expansions. Here we have assessed the levels of MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 expression in a large number of murine tissues by transcript analysis and simultaneous Western blotting. We observed that MMR expression patterns varied widely between 14 different tissue types, but did not vary with age (13\u201384 weeks). MMR protein expression is highest in testis, thymus and spleen and lowest in pancreas, quadriceps and heart, with intermediate levels in liver, kidney, intestine, colon, cortex, striatum and cerebellum. By equalizing antibody signal intensity to represent levels found in mMutS\u03b1 and mMutS\u03b2 purified proteins, we observed that mMSH3 protein levels are greater than mMSH6 levels in the multiple tissues analyzed, with more MSH6 in proliferating tissues. In the intestinal epithelium MSH3 and MSH6 are more highly expressed in the proliferative undifferentiated cells of the crypts than in the differentiated villi cells, as reported for MSH2. This finding correlates with the higher level of MMR expression in highly proliferative mouse tissues such as the spleen and thymus. The relative MMR protein expression levels may explain the functional and tissue-specific reliance upon the roles of each MMR protein.",

The proteins form a right-handed nucleoprotein complex on ssDNA called the presynaptic filament. In an ATP-dependent manner, the presynaptic filament searches for homology to form a physical connection with the homologous chromosome. We constructed two variants of hDMC1 altering the conserved lysine residue of the Walker A motif to arginine (hDMC1K132R) or alanine (hDMC1K132A). The hDMC1 variants were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to near homogeneity. Both hDMC1K132R and hDMC1K132A variants were devoid of ATP hydrolysis. The hDMC1K132R variant was attenuated for ATP binding that was partially restored by the addition of either ssDNA or calcium. The hDMC1K132R variant was partially capable of homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange in the presence of calcium and protecting DNA from a nuclease, while the hDMC1K132A variant was inactive. These results suggest that the conserved lysine of the Walker A motif in hDMC1 plays a key role in ATP binding. Furthermore, the binding of calcium and ssDNA promotes a conformational change in the ATP binding pocket of hDMC1 that promotes ATP binding. Our results provide evidence that the conserved lysine in the Walker A motif of hDMC1 is critical for ATP binding which is required for presynaptic filament formation.",

The relationships between dNTPs and error rates have been studied in vitro, but only limited insights exist into these correlations during in vivo replication. We have investigated this issue in the bacterium Escherichia coli by analyzing the mutational properties of dcd and ndk strains. These strains, defective in dCTP deaminase and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, respectively, are characterized by both disturbances of dNTP pools and a mutator phenotype. ndk strains have been studied before, but were included in this study, as controversies exist regarding the source of its mutator phenotype. We show that dcd strains suffer from increased intracellular levels of dCTP (4-fold) and reduced levels of dGTP (2-fold), while displaying, as measured using a set of lacZ reversion markers in a mismatch-repair defective (mutL) background, a strong mutator effect for G\u00b7C\u2192T\u00b7A and A\u00b7T\u2192T\u00b7A transversions (27- and 42-fold enhancement, respectively).

The two strains also display differential mutability for rifampicin-resistant mutants. Overall, our analysis reveals for both strains a satisfactory correlation between dNTP pool alterations and the replication error rates, and also suggests that a minimal explanation for the ndk mutator does not require assumptions beyond the predicted effect of the dNTP pools.",

The assembly state of TFIIH is known to be affected by truncation mutations in xeroderma pigmentosum group G/Cockayne syndrome (XP-G/CS). Here, we showed that CAK component MAT1 was rapidly recruited to UV-induced DNA damage sites, co-localizing with core TFIIH component p62, and dispersed from the damage sites upon completion of DNA repair. While the core TFIIH\u2013CAK association remained intact, MAT1 failed to accumulate at DNA damage sites in fibroblasts harboring XP-B or XP-B/CS mutations. Nevertheless, MAT1, XPD and XPC as well as XPG were able to accumulate at damage sites in XP-D fibroblasts, in which the core TFIIH-CAK association also remained intact. Interestingly, XPG recruitment was impaired in XP-B/CS fibroblasts derived from patients with mild phenotype, but persisted in XP-B/CS fibroblasts from severely affected patients resulting in a nonfunctional preincision complex. An examination of steady-state levels of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) indicated that UV-induced RNAPII phosphorylation was dramatically reduced in XP-B/CS fibroblasts. These results demonstrated that the CAK rapidly disassociates from the core TFIIH upon assembly of nonfunctional preincision complex in XP-B and XP-B/CS cells.

     "abstract": "SN1 DNA methylating agents are genotoxic agents that methylate numerous nucleophilic centers within DNA including the O6 position of guanine (O6meG). Methylation of this extracyclic oxygen forces mispairing with thymine during DNA replication. The mismatch repair (MMR) system recognizes these O6meG:T mispairs and is required to activate DNA damage response (DDR). Exonuclease I (EXO1) is a key component of MMR by resecting the damaged strand; however, whether EXO1 is required to activate MMR-dependent DDR remains unknown. Here we show that knockdown of the mouse ortholog (mExo1) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) results in decreased G2/M checkpoint response, limited effects on cell proliferation, and increased cell viability following exposure to the SN1 methylating agent N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), establishing a phenotype paralleling MMR deficiency. MNNG treatment induced formation of \u03b3-H2AX foci with which EXO1 co-localized in MEFs, but mExo1-depleted MEFs displayed a significant diminishment of \u03b3-H2AX foci formation. mExo1 depletion also reduced MSH2 association with DNA duplexes containing G:T mismatches in vitro, decreased MSH2 association with alkylated chromatin in vivo, and abrogated MNNG-induced MSH2/CHK1 interaction. To determine if nuclease activity is required to activate DDR we stably overexpressed a nuclease defective form of human EXO1 (hEXO1) in mExo1-depleted MEFs. These experiments indicated that expression of wildtype and catalytically null hEXO1 was able to restore normal response to MNNG. This study indicates that EXO1 is required to activate MMR-dependent DDR in response to SN1 methylating agents; however, this function of EXO1 is independent of its nucleolytic activity.",

Adenoviral transduction of Huh7 tumor cells with the TIS21 gene accelerated the repair of DSBs induced by etoposide treatment as evaluated by clearance of \u03b3H2AX foci and the Comet assay. TIS21 increased methylation of Mre11 and protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) activity, leading to Mre11 activation in vitro and in vivo, as determined by immunoprecipitation and radiolabeling analyses.

The loss of Chk2 activation after etoposide treatment reduced apoptosis in the cells by downregulating the expression of E2F1 and Bax.

Crosslinking agents have been shown to stall DNA replication and failure to repair ICL lesions before encountered by replication forks may induce severe DNA damage. Most knowledge of the ICL repair process has been revealed from studies in bacteria and cell extracts. However, for mammalian cells the process of ICL repair is still unclear and conflicting data exist. In this study we have explored the fate of psoralen-induced ICLs during replication, by employing intact mammalian cells and novel techniques. By comparative studies distinguishing between effects by monoadducts versus ICLs, we have been able to link the block of replication to the ICLs induction. We found that the replication fork was equally blocked by ICLs in wild-type cells as in cells deficient in ERCC1/XPF and XRCC3. The formation of ICL induced double strand breaks (DSBs), detected by formation of 53PB1 foci, was equally induced in the three cell lines suggesting that these proteins are involved at a later step of the repair process. Furthermore, we found that forks blocked by ICLs were neither bypassed, restarted nor restored for several hours. We propose that this process is different from that taking place following monoadduct induction by UV-light treatment where replication bypass is taking place as an early step. Altogether our findings suggest that restoration of an ICL blocked replication fork, likely initiated by a DSB occurs relatively rapidly at a stalled fork, is followed by restoration, which seems to be a rather slow process in intact mammalian cells.",

Depletion of dUTPase activity in the absence of UNG provoked cell cycle alterations, massive dUTP misincorporation into DNA and chromosomal fragmentation.

To determine the mutagenic consequences of uracil in DNA, mutation rates and spectra were analyzed in dUTPase-depleted cells in the presence of UNG activity. These cells displayed a spontaneous mutation rate 9-fold higher than the parental cell line. Base substitutions at A:T base pairs and deletion frequencies were both significantly enhanced which is consistent with the generation of mutagenic AP sites and DNA strand breaks.

     "abstract": "Base excision repair (BER) is an evolutionarily conserved DNA repair pathway that is critical for repair of many of the most common types of DNA damage generated both by endogenous metabolic pathways and exposure to exogenous stressors such as pollutants. Caenorhabditis elegans is an increasingly important model organism for the study of DNA damage-related processes including DNA repair, genotoxicity, and apoptosis, but BER is not well understood in this organism, and has not previously been measured in vivo. We report robust BER in the nuclear genome and slightly slower damage removal from the mitochondrial genome; in both cases the removal rates are comparable to those observed in mammals. However we could detect no deficiency in BER in the nth-1 strain, which carries a deletion in the only glycosylase yet described in C. elegans that repairs oxidative DNA damage. We also failed to detect increased lethality or growth inhibition in nth-1 nematodes after exposure to oxidative or alkylating damage, suggesting the existence of at least one additional as-yet undetected glycosylase.",

     "abstract": "It is believed that normal cells with an unaffected DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA damage repair machinery, could be less prone to DNA damaging treatment than cancer cells. However, the anticancer drug, etoposide, which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor, can generate DNA double strand breaks affecting not only replication but also transcription and therefore can induce DNA damage in non-replicating cells. Indeed, we showed that etoposide could influence transcription and was able to activate DDR in resting human T cells by inducing phosphorylation of ATM and its substrates, H2AX and p53. This led to activation of PUMA, caspases and to apoptotic cell death. Lymphoblastoid leukemic Jurkat cells, as cycling cells, were more sensitive to etoposide considering the level of DNA damage, DDR and apoptosis. Next, we used ATM inhibitor, KU 55933, which has been shown previously to be a radio/chemo-sensitizing agent. Pretreatment of resting T cells with KU 55933 blocked phosphorylation of ATM, H2AX and p53, which, in turn, prevented PUMA expression, caspase activation and apoptosis. On the other hand, KU 55933 incremented apoptosis of Jurkat cells. However, etoposide-induced DNA damage in resting T cells was not influenced by KU 55933 as revealed by the FADU assay. Altogether our results show that KU 55933 blocks DDR and apoptosis induced by etoposide in normal resting T cells, but increased cytotoxic effect on proliferating leukemic Jurkat cells. We discuss the possible beneficial and adverse effects of drugs affecting the DDR in cancer cells that are currently in preclinical anticancer trials.",

     "abstract": "XPD is a helicase subunit of transcription factor IIH, an eleven-protein complex involved in a wide range of cellular activities including transcription and nucleotide excision DNA repair (NER). Mutations in NER genes including XPD can lead to a variety of overlapping syndromes with three general categories of symptoms in addition to sun (UV) sensitivity: severe skin cancer predisposition as in xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), segmental progeria as in trichothiodystrophy (TTD) and Cockayne syndrome (CS), and a combination of both as in XP/CS and XP/TTD. Genetic background and compound heterozygosity are two factors potentially complicating straightforward interpretations of genotype\u2013phenotype relationship at the XPD locus. Previously we showed that the presence of two different mutant Xpd alleles in compound heterozygous mice could in principle contribute to disease heterogeneity through biallelic effects, including dominance of one mutant allele over another and interallelic complementation between mutant alleles, in a tissue-specific manner. Here we report on the interaction between different mutant alleles in compound heterozygous mice carrying one XP/CS-associated allele (XpdG602D) and one TTD-associated allele (XpdR722W) relative to homozygous controls in an isogenic background over a range of metabolic and UV-induced DNA damage-related phenotypes. We found complementation of metabolic phenotypes including body weight and insulin sensitivity, but none for any of the measured responses to UV irradiation. Instead, we found dominance of the partially functional TTD allele over the XPCS allele in most aspects of the response to UV irradiation including sunburn and skin cancer in vivo or cellular proliferation and DNA damage foci formation in vitro. These data support to a model of genotype\u2013phenotype relationship at the XPD locus in which interactions between different recessive diseases alleles are a potent source of disease heterogeneity in compound heterozygous patients.",

     "abstract": "Endonuclease VIII (Nei) from Escherichia coli is a DNA repair enzyme that removes a wide range of oxidized pyrimidine bases from DNA. As inferred from the crystal structures and biochemical studies, recognition of DNA lesions by Nei involves several conformational changes in both protein and DNA, such as DNA kinking, damaged base eversion into the enzyme's active site, and insertion of a loop of the enzyme into the void formed by the eversion. Excision of the damaged base by Nei also proceeds through several chemical steps: N-glycosidic bond breakage, \u03b2-elimination and \u03b4-elimination of the phosphates flanking the lesion. We have used stopped-flow kinetics with fluorescence detection to follow conformational changes in the Nei molecule when the enzyme binds normal DNA, damaged but uncleavable DNA, or several cleavable damaged DNA substrates. Binding normal or damaged uncleavable DNA proceeded in two fluorescently discernible reversible stages, while processing of cleavable substrates involved three reversible stages followed by and irreversible stage and equilibrium with the reaction product. Individual rate constants were calculated for each reaction step. Based on the stopped-flow data, crystal structure, and a comparison with the stopped-flow kinetics of E. coli formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase, a homolog of Nei, we propose the nature of some of the steps that may be involved into the recognition and excision of damaged bases by Nei.",

X-family DNA polymerases (PolXs) play critical roles in BER, especially in filling single-nucleotide gaps. In addition to a polymerase core domain, bacterial PolXs have a polymerase and histidinol phosphatase (PHP) domain with phosphoesterase activity which is also required for BER. However, the role of the PHP domain of PolX in bacterial BER remains unresolved. We found that the PHP domain of Thermus thermophilus HB8 PolX (ttPolX) functions as two types of phosphoesterase in BER, including a 3\u2032-phosphatase and an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease. Experiments using T. thermophilus HB8 cell lysates revealed that the majority of the 3\u2032-phosphatase and AP endonuclease activities are attributable to the another phosphoesterase in T. thermophilus HB8, endonuclease IV (ttEndoIV). However, ttPolX possesses significant 3\u2032-phosphatase activity in \u0394ttendoIV cell lysate, indicating possible complementation. Our experiments also reveal that there are only two enzymes that display the 3\u2032-phosphatase activity in the T. thermophilus HB8 cell, ttPolX and ttEndoIV. Furthermore, phenotypic analysis of \u0394ttpolX, \u0394ttendoIV, and \u0394ttpolX/\u0394ttendoIV using hydrogen peroxide and sodium nitrite supports the hypothesis that ttPolX functions as a backup for ttEndoIV in BER.",

     "abstract": "An unconventional DNA repair termed SIR ( S OS I ndependent R epair), specific to mitomycin C (MMC) damage elicited by a combination of specific RifR (rpoB87) and NalR (gyrA87) mutations in SOS un-inducible strains of Escherichia coli was reported by Kumaresan and Jayaraman (1988). We report here that the rpoB87 mutation defines a C1565\u2192T1565 transition changing S522\u2192F522 and gyrA87 defines a G244\u2192A244 transition changing D82\u2192N82. The reconstructed lexA3 rpoB87 gyrA87 strain (DM49RN) exhibited resistance to MMC but not to UV as expected. When mutations in several genes implicated in SOS/NER were introduced into DM49RN strain, uvrB mutation alone decreased the MMC resistance and suppressed SIR phenotype. This was alleviated about two fold by a plasmid clone bearing the uvrB+ allele. Neither SulA activity as measured based on filamentation and sulA::gfp fluorescence analyses nor the transcript levels of sulA as seen based on RT-PCR analyses indicate a change in sulA expression in DM49RN strain. However, uvrB transcript levels are increased with or without MMC treatment in the same strain. While the presence of lexA3 allele in a plasmid clone was found to markedly decrease the MMC resistance of the DM49RN strain, the additional presence of uvrB+ allele in the same clone alleviated the suppression of MMC resistance by lexA3 allele to a considerable extent. These results indicate the increased expression of uvrB in the DM49RN strain is probably from the LexA dependent promoter of uvrB. The sequence analyses of various uvrB mutants including those isolated in this study using localized mutagenesis indicate the involvement of the nucleotide phosphate binding domain (ATPase domain) and the ATP binding domain and/or the DNA binding domain of the UvrB protein in the MMC repair in DM49RN. The possible involvement of UvrB protein in the MMC damage repair in DM49RN strain in relation to DNA repair is discussed.",

R-cdA and S-cdA are repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER) in mammalian cellular extracts. Here, we have examined seven purified base excision repair enzymes for their ability to repair S-cdG or S-cdA. We could not detect either excision or binding of these enzymes on duplex oligonucleotide substrates containing these lesions. However, both lesions were repaired by HeLa cell extracts.

The time course of dual incisions were measured in comparison to cis-anti-B[a]P-N2-dG, an excellent substrate for human NER, which showed that cis-anti-B[a]P-N2-dG was repaired more efficiently than S-cdG, which, in turn, was repaired more efficiently than S-cdA. When NER efficiency of S-cdG with different complementary bases was investigated, the wobble pair S-cdG\u00b7dT was excised more efficiently than the S-cdG\u00b7dC pair that maintains nearly normal Watson-Crick base pairing.

To preserve the integrity of the genome, eukaryotic cells have evolved extremely intricate mechanisms for repairing DNA damage. One type of DNA lesion is a double-strand break (DSB), which is highly toxic when unrepaired. Repair of DSBs can occur through multiple mechanisms. Aside from religating the DNA ends, a homologous template can be used for repair in a process called homologous recombination (HR). One key step in committing to HR is the formation of Rad51 filaments, which perform the homology search and strand invasion steps. In S. cerevisiae, Srs2 is a key regulator of Rad51 filament formation and disassembly.

Furthermore, at the replication fork, Srs2 is required for fork progression and prevents the instability of trinucleotide repeats. To better understand the multiple roles of the Srs2 helicase during these processes, we analysed the ability of Srs2 to bind and unwind various DNA substrates that mimic structures present during DNA replication and recombination. While leading or lagging strands were efficiently unwound, the presence of ssDNA binding protein RPA presented an obstacle for Srs2 translocation. We also tested the preferred directionality of unwinding of various substrates and studied the effect of Rad51 and Mre11 proteins on Srs2 helicase activity. These biochemical results help us understand the possible role of Srs2 in the processing of stalled or blocked replication forks as a part of post-replication repair as well as homologous recombination (HR).",

Nse2 was dispensable for DT40 cell viability and required for efficient repair of bulky DNA lesions, although Nse2-deficient cells showed normal sensitivity to ionising radiation-induced DNA damage. Homologous recombination activities were reduced in Nse2\u2212/\u2212/\u2212 cells. Nse2 deficiency destabilised Smc5, but not Smc6.

Analysis of Nse2\u2212/\u2212/\u2212Smc5\u2212 clones, which were viable although slow-growing, showed no significant increase in DNA damage sensitivity.

While purified EXO-3 directly incises AP sites and removes 3\u2032-blocking groups, such characterization has not been previously reported for APN-1. We recently documented that C. elegans knockdown for apn-1 is unable to maintain integrity of the genome. Despite the presence of EXO-3, the apn-1 knockdown animals are also defective in the division of the P1 blastomere, an observation consistent with the accumulation of unrepaired DNA lesions suggesting a unique role for APN-1 DNA repair functions. Herein, we show that C. elegans APN-1 is stably expressed as GST-fusion protein in S. cerevisiae only when it carries a nuclear localization signal, and with this requirement rescued the DNA repair defects of the S. cerevisiae apn1\u0394 apn2\u0394 tpp1\u0394 triple mutant. We purified the APN-1 from the yeast expression system and established that it displays AP endonuclease and 3\u2032-diesterase activities. In addition, we showed that APN-1 also possesses a 3\u2032- to 5\u2032-exonuclease and the nucleotide incision repair activity. This latter activity is capable of directly incising DNA at the 5\u2032-side of various oxidatively damaged bases, as previously observed for Escherichia coli endonuclease IV and S. cerevisiae Apn1, underscoring the importance of this family of enzymes in removing these types of lesions. Glycine substitution of the conserved amino acid residue Glu261 of APN-1, corresponding to Glu145 involved in coordinating Zn2+ ions in the active site pocket of E. coli endonuclease IV, resulted in an inactive variant that lose the ability to rescue the DNA repair defects of S. cerevisiae apn1\u0394 apn2\u0394 tpp1\u0394 mutant.

Using repair-proficient mice as an in vivo system we monitored the accumulation of DNA damage in normal tissues exposed to daily low-dose radiation of 100\u00a0mGy or 10\u00a0mGy. Radiation-induced foci in differentiated and tissue-specific stem cells were quantified by immunofluorescence microscopy after 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 weeks of daily low-dose radiation and DNA lesions were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) combined with immunogold-labeling. In brain, long-living cortical neurons had a significant accumulation of foci with increasing cumulative doses. In intestine and skin, characterized by constant cell renewal of their epithelial lining, differentiated enterocytes and keratinocytes had either unchanged or only slightly increased foci levels during protracted low-dose radiation.

To test if these phenotypes required the catalytic activity of Yen1, we introduced point mutations targeting the catalytic site of Yen1, which abolished the nuclease activity in vitro. Remarkably, catalytically inactive Yen1 did not exacerbate the hydroxyurea sensitivity of the sgs1\u0394 strain, which the yen1\u0394 allele did. In addition, overexpression of catalytically inactive Yen1 partially rescued the DNA damage sensitivity of both mus81 and sgs1 mutant strains albeit less efficiently than WT Yen1. These results suggest that Yen1 serves both a catalytic and non-catalytic role in its redundant function with Mus81 and Sgs1. Diploids lacking Mus81 had a severe defect in sporulation efficiency and crossover frequency, but diploids lacking both Mus81 and Yen1 showed no further reduction in spore formation. Hence, Yen1 had no evident role in meiosis. However, overexpression of WT Yen1, but not catalytically inactive Yen1 partially rescued the crossover defect in mus81/mus81 mutant diploids. Yen1 is a member of the RAD2/XPG-family of nucleases, but genetic analyses revealed no genetic interaction between yen1 and other family members (rad2, exo1 and rad27). In addition, yen1 mutants had normal nonhomologous end-joining efficiency. We discuss the similarities and differences between K. lactis Yen1 and Yen1/GEN1 from other organisms.",

     "abstract": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an important DNA repair mechanism through which cells remove bulky DNA lesions. Following DNA damage, the histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300 (also referred to as lysine acetyltransferase or KAT) is known to associate with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a master regulator of DNA replication and repair processes. This interaction, which results in HAT inhibition, may be dissociated by the cell cycle inhibitor p21CDKN1A, thereby restoring p300 activity; however, the role of this protein interplay is still unclear. Here, we report that silencing p300 or its homolog CREB-binding protein (CBP) by RNA interference (RNAi) significantly reduces DNA repair synthesis in human fibroblasts. In addition, we determined whether p300 and CBP may associate with and acetylate specific NER factors such as XPG, the 3\u2032-endonuclease that is involved in the incision/excision step and is known to interact with PCNA. Our results show that p300 and CBP interact with XPG, which has been found to be acetylated in vivo. XPG is acetylated by p300 in vitro, and this reaction is inhibited by PCNA. Knocking down both p300/CBP by RNAi or by chemical inhibition with curcumin greatly reduced XPG acetylation, and a concomitant accumulation of the protein at DNA damage sites was observed. The ability of p21 to bind PCNA was found to regulate the interaction between p300 and XPG, and an abnormal accumulation of XPG at DNA damage sites was also found in p21\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts. These results indicate an additional function of p300/CBP in NER through the acetylation of XPG protein in a PCNA\u2013p21 dependent manner.",

The meeting was attended by a productive mix of scientists, ranging from those prominent in the initial characterization of the underlying genetic defect to young scientists just entering the field. In broad terms, three main themes were discussed at the meeting: first, a wealth of new details emerged on DNA damage signaling/repair mechanisms for which ATM is a critical element; secondly, important functions for ATM in previously unrelated cellular pathways were identified; and thirdly, new physiological effects and potential therapeutic treatments related to A-T were presented.

     "abstract": "Formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg; MutM) is a DNA repair enzyme widely distributed in bacteria. Fpg recognizes and excises oxidatively modified purines, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine and 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), with similar excision kinetics. It exhibits some lesser activity toward 8-oxoadenine. Fpg enzymes are also present in some plant and fungal species. The eukaryotic Fpg homologs exhibit little or no activity on DNA containing 8-oxoG, but they recognize and process its oxidation products, guanidinohydantoin (Gh) and spiroiminohydantoin (Sp). To date, several structures of bacterial Fpg enzymes unliganded or in complex with DNA containing a damaged base have been published but there is no structure of a eukaryotic Fpg. Here we describe the first crystal structure of a plant Fpg, Arabidopsis thaliana (AthFpg), unliganded and bound to DNA containing an abasic site analog, tetrahydrofuran (THF). Although AthFpg shares a common architecture with other Fpg glycosylases, it harbors a zincless finger, previously described in a subset of Nei enzymes, such as human NEIL1 and Mimivirus Nei1. Importantly the \u201c\u03b1F\u2013\u03b29/10 loop\u201d capping 8-oxoG in the active site of bacterial Fpg is very short in AthFpg. Deletion of a segment encompassing residues 213\u2013229 in Escherichia coli Fpg (EcoFpg) and corresponding to the \u201c\u03b1F\u2013\u03b29/10 loop\u201d does not affect the recognition and removal of oxidatively damaged DNA base lesions, with the exception of 8-oxoG. Although the exact role of the loop remains to be further explored, it is now clear that this protein segment is specific to the processing of 8-oxoG.",

The fidelity and sugar selectivity of pol V can be modified by missense mutations around the \u201csteric gate\u201d of UmuC. Here, we analyze the ability of three steric gate mutants of UmuC to facilitate translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) of a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) in vitro, and to promote UV-induced mutagenesis and cell survival in vivo. The pol V (UmuC_F10L) mutant discriminates against rNTP and incorrect dNTP incorporation much better than wild-type pol V and although exhibiting a reduced ability to bypass a CPD in vitro, does so with high-fidelity and consequently produces minimal UV-induced mutagenesis in vivo. In contrast, pol V (UmuC_Y11A) readily misincorporates both rNTPs and dNTPs during efficient TLS of the CPD in vitro. However, cells expressing umuD\u2032C(Y11A) were considerably more UV-sensitive and exhibited lower levels of UV-induced mutagenesis than cells expressing wild-type umuD\u2032C or umuD\u2032C(Y11F). We propose that the increased UV-sensitivity and reduced UV-mutability of umuD\u2032C(Y11A) is due to excessive incorporation of rNTPs during TLS that are subsequently targeted for repair, rather than an inability to traverse UV-induced lesions.",

The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori express a nucleoid-associated protein encoded by the hup gene, which is the homolog to the Escherichia coli histone-like protein HU. An H. pylori hup mutant strain (X47 hup:cat) showed a defect in stationary phase survival. The X47 hup:cat mutant was more sensitive to the DNA damaging agent mitomycin C, and displayed a decreased frequency of DNA recombination, indicating Hup plays a significant role in facilitating DNA recombinational repair. The X47 hup:cat mutant was also sensitive to both oxidative and acid stress, conditions that H. pylori commonly encounters in the host. The hup mutant cells survived significantly (7-fold) less upon exposure to macrophages than the wild type strain. In a mouse infection model, the hup mutant strain displayed a greatly reduced ability to colonize host stomachs. The geometric means of colonization number for the wild type and hup mutant were 6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 and 1.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0CFU/g stomachs, respectively. Complementation of the hup strain by chromosomal insertion of a functional hup gene restored oxidative stress resistance, DNA transformation frequency, and mouse colonization ability to the wild type level.

They are also activated by ionizing radiation (IR) that induces DNA double-strand breaks. Studies in human tissue culture and Xenopus egg extracts identified Claspin as a mediator that increased the activity of ATR toward Chk1. Because the in vivo functions of Claspin are not known, we generated Drosophila lines that each contained a mutated Claspin gene. Similar to the Drosophila mei-41/ATR and grp/Chk1 mutants, embryos of the Claspin mutant showed defects in checkpoint activation, which normally occurs in early embryogenesis in response to incomplete DNA replication. Additionally, Claspin mutant larvae were defective in G2 arrest after HU treatment; however, the defects were less severe than those of the mei-41/ATR and grp/Chk1 mutants. In contrast, IR-induced G2 arrest, which was severely defective in mei-41/ATR and grp/Chk1 mutants, occurred normally in the Claspin mutant. We also found that Claspin was phosphorylated in response to HU and IR treatment and a hyperphosphorylated form of Claspin was generated only after HU treatment in mei-41/ATR-dependent and tefu/ATM-independent way. In summary, our data suggest that Drosophila Claspin is required for the G2 arrest that is induced by DNA replication stress but not by DNA double-strand breaks, and this difference is probably due to distinct phosphorylation statuses.",

We employed Saccharomyces cerevisiae in an unbiased forward genetic screen to identify amino acid substitutions in the major yeast AP endonuclease, Apn1, that impair cellular DNA repair capacity by conferring sensitivity to the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate. We report here the identification and characterization of the Apn1 V156E amino acid substitution mutant through biochemical and functional analysis. We found that steady state levels of Apn1 V156E were substantially decreased compared to wild type protein, and that this decrease was due to more rapid degradation of mutant protein compared to wild type. Based on homology to E. coli endonuclease IV and computational modeling, we predicted that V156E impairs catalytic ability. However, overexpression of mutant protein restored DNA repair activity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, the V156E substitution decreases DNA repair capacity by an unanticipated mechanism via increased degradation of mutant protein, leading to substantially reduced cellular levels. Our study provides evidence that the V156 residue plays a critical role in Apn1 structural integrity, but is not involved in catalytic activity. These results have important implications for elucidating structure\u2013function relationships for the endonuclease IV family of proteins, and for employing simple eukaryotic model systems to understand how structural defects in the major human AP endonuclease APE1 may contribute to disease etiology.",

     "abstract": "Base excision repair of oxidized DNA in human cells is initiated by several DNA glycosylases with overlapping substrate specificity. The human endonuclease VIII homologue NEIL1 removes a broad spectrum of oxidized pyrimidine and purine lesions. In this study of NEIL1 we have identified several key residues, located in three loops lining the DNA binding cavity, important for lesion recognition and DNA glycosylase/AP lyase activity for oxidized bases in double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. Single-turnover kinetics of NEIL1 revealed that removal of 5-hydroxycytosine (5-OHC) and 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU) is \u223c25 and \u223c10-fold faster in duplex DNA compared to single-stranded DNA, respectively, and also faster than removal of dihydrothymine (DHT) and dihydrouracil (DHU), both in double-stranded and single-stranded DNA. NEIL1 excised 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) only from double-stranded DNA and analysis of site-specific mutants revealed that Met81, Arg119 and Phe120 are essential for removal of 8-oxoG. Further, several arginine and histidine residues located in the loop connecting the two \u03b2-strands forming the zincless finger motif and projecting into the DNA major groove, were shown to be imperative for lesion processing for both single- and double-stranded substrates. Trapping experiments of active site mutants revealed that the N-terminal Pro2 and Lys54 can alternate to form a Schiff-base complex between the protein and DNA. Hence, both Pro2 and Lys54 are involved in the AP lyase activity. While wildtype NEIL1 activity almost exclusively generated a \u03b4-elimination product when processing single-stranded substrates, substitution of Lys54 changed this in favor of a \u03b2-elimination product. These results suggest that Pro2 and Lys54 are both essential for the concerted action of the \u03b2,\u03b4-elimination in NEIL1.",

In contrast, stress-induced telomere shortening, which is believed to be just as important for causing cellular senescence, cannot be measured properly using these methods. Stress-induced telomere shortening caused by, e.g. oxidative damage happens in a stochastic manner leaving just a few single telomeres critically short. It is now possible to visualize these few ultra-short telomeres due to the advantages of the newly developed Universal single telomere length assay (STELA), and we therefore believe that this method should be considered the method of choice when measuring the length of telomeres after exposure to oxidative stress. In order to test our hypothesis, cultured human mesenchymal stem cells, either primary or hTERT immortalized, were exposed to sub-lethal doses of hydrogen peroxide, and the short term effect on telomere dynamics was monitored by Universal STELA and TRF measurements. Both telomere measures were then correlated with the percentage of senescent cells estimated by senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase staining. The exposure to acute oxidative stress resulted in an increased number of ultra-short telomeres, which correlated strongly with the percentage of senescent cells, whereas a correlation between mean telomere length and the percentage of senescent cells was absent. Based on the findings in the present study, it seems reasonable to conclude that Universal STELA is superior to TRF in detecting telomere damage caused by exposure to oxidative stress. The choice of method should therefore be considered carefully in studies examining stress-related telomere shortening as well as in the emerging field of lifestyle studies involving telomere length measurements.",

     "abstract": "A key component of the response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation is DNA repair. Release of extracellular nucleotides, such as ATP, from cells plays a role in signaling via P2 receptors. We show here that release of ATP, followed by activation of P2Y receptors, is involved in the response to \u03b3-irradiation-induced DNA damage. Formation of phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) foci, which are induced in nuclei by DNA damage and contribute to accumulation of DNA-repair factors, was increased at 1\u20133\u00a0h after \u03b3-ray irradiation (2.0\u00a0Gy) of human lung cancer A549 cells. Focus formation was suppressed by pre-treatment with the ecto-nucleotidase apyrase. Pre-treatment with ecto-nucleotidase inhibitor ARL67156 or post-treatment with ATP or UTP facilitated induction of \u03b3H2AX, indicating that extracellular nucleotides play a role in induction of \u03b3H2AX foci. Next, we examined the effect of P2 receptor inhibitors on activation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; a protein kinase) and accumulation of 53BP1 (a DNA repair factor), both of which are important for DNA repair, at DNA damage sites. P2Y6 receptor antagonist MRS2578, P2Y12 receptor antagonist clopidogrel, and P2X7 receptor antagonists A438079 and oxATP significantly inhibited these processes. Release of ATP was detected within 2.5\u00a0min after irradiation, but was blocked by A438079. Activation of ATM and accumulation of 53BP1 were decreased in P2Y6 or P2Y12 receptor-knockdown cells.

We investigated how rad3 (ATR ortholog) or chk1/cds1 (CHK1/CHK2 orthologs) null mutations change the kinetics of double-strand break (DSB) repair in Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells under conditions of forced G2 arrest. After 200-Gy \u03b3-ray irradiation, DSBs were repaired in rad3\u0394 cdc25-22 or chk1\u0394 cds1\u0394 cdc25-22 cells, almost as efficiently as in cdc25-22 cells at the restrictive temperature. In contrast, little repair was observed in the checkpoint-deficient cells up to 4\u00a0h after higher-dose (500\u00a0Gy) irradiation, whereas repair was still efficient in the control cdc25-22 cells. Immediate loss of viability appeared not be responsible for the repair defect after the higher dose, since both checkpoint-proficient and deficient cells with cdc25-22 allele synchronously resumed cycling with a similar time course when released to the permissive temperature 4\u00a0h after irradiation. Recruitment of repair proteins Rad11 (Rpa1 ortholog), Rad22 (Rad52 ortholog), and Rhp54 (Rad54 ortholog) to the damage sites was not significantly impaired in the checkpoint-deficient cells, whereas their release was profoundly delayed. Our results suggest that sensor and effector kinases in the damage checkpoint machinery affect the efficiency of repair downstream of, or in parallel with the core repair reaction.",

Here, we report that pnk1pku70 and pnk1rhp51 double mutants are more sensitive to \u03b3-radiation than single mutants, from which we infer that Pnk1's primary role is independent of either homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining mechanisms. We also report that pnk1 cells are more sensitive than wild-type cells to oxidizing and alkylating agents, suggesting that Pnk1 is involved in base excision repair. Mutational analysis of Pnk1 revealed that the DNA 3\u2032-phosphatase activity is necessary for repair of DNA damage, whereas the 5\u2032-kinase activity is dispensable. A role for Pnk1 in base excision repair is supported by genetic analyses which revealed that pnk1apn2 is synthetically lethal, suggesting that Pnk1 and Apn2 may function in parallel pathways essential for the repair of endogenous DNA damage. Furthermore, the nth1pnk1apn2 and tdp1pnk1apn2 triple mutants are viable, implying that single-strand breaks with 3\u2032-blocked termini produced by Nth1 and Tdp1 contribute to synthetic lethality. We also examined the sensitivity to methyl methanesulfonate of all single and double mutant combinations of nth1, apn2, tdp1 and pnk1. Together, our results support a model where Tdp1 and Pnk1 act in concert in an Apn2-independent base excision repair pathway to repair 3\u2032-blocked termini produced by Nth1; and they also provide evidence that Pnk1 has additional roles in base excision repair.",

Although mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in processes such as premature aging, neurodegeneration, and cancer, it has not been shown whether persistent mtDNA damage causes a loss of oxidative phosphorylation. We addressed this question by treating mouse embryonic fibroblasts with either hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and measuring several endpoints, including mtDNA damage and repair rates using QPCR, levels of mitochondrial- and nuclear-encoded proteins using antibody analysis, and a pharmacologic profile of mitochondria using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer. We show that a 60\u00a0min treatment with H2O2 causes persistent mtDNA lesions, mtDNA loss, decreased levels of a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial subunit, a loss of ATP-linked oxidative phosphorylation and a loss of total reserve capacity. Conversely, a 60\u00a0min treatment with 2\u00a0mM MMS causes persistent mtDNA lesions but no mtDNA loss, no decrease in levels of a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial subunit, and no mitochondrial dysfunction. These results suggest that persistent mtDNA damage is not sufficient to cause mitochondrial dysfunction.",

     "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that mildly predict prostate cancer risk. These SNPs are local tagging markers for causal gene alterations. Consideration of candidate genes in the tagged regions would be facilitated by additional information on the particular pathomechanisms which contribute to the observed risk increase. In this study we test for an association of prostate cancer tagging SNPs with alterations in DNA repair capacity, a phenotype that is frequently involved in cancer predisposition. DNA repair capacity was assessed on blood lymphocytes from 128 healthy probands after ionizing irradiation. We used the micronucleus (MN) assay to determine the cellular DNA double-strand break repair capacity and flow cytometry to measure damage induced mitotic delay (MD). Probands were genotyped for a panel of 14 SNPs, each representing an independent prostate cancer risk locus previously identified by GWAS. Associations between germline variants and DNA repair capacity were found for the SNPs rs1512268 (8p21), rs6983267 (8q24) and rs10993994 (10q11). The most significant finding was an association of homozygous rs10993994 T-allele carriers with a lower MN frequency (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003) and also a decreased MD index (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0353). Cells with prostate cancer risk alleles at rs10993994 seem to cope more efficiently with DNA double strand breaks (less MN) in a shorter time (decreased MD index). This intriguing finding imposes concern about the accuracy of repair, with respect to the cancer risk that is mediated by T genotypes. To date, MSMB (microseminoprotein \u03b2) is favored as the causal gene at the 10q11 risk locus, since it was the first candidate gene known to be expressionally altered by rs10993994. Based on the present observation, candidate genes from the contexts of DNA repair and apoptosis may be more promising targets for expression studies with respect to the rs10993994 genotype.",

We describe the frequency and spectrum of somatic mutations involving several tumor suppressor genes in the rectal carcinoma of a 13-year-old girl harboring biallelic, germline mutations in the DNA mismatch repair gene PMS2. Apart from microsatellite instability, the tumor DNA contained a number of C:G\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T:A or G:C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0A:T transitions in CpG dinucleotides, which often result through spontaneous deamination of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine. Four DNA glycosylases, UNG2, SMUG1, MBD4 and TDG, are involved in the repair of these deamination events. We identified a heterozygous missense mutation in TDG, which was associated with TDG protein loss in the tumor. The CpGs mutated in this patient's tumor are generally methylated in normal colonic mucosa. Thus, it is highly likely that loss of TDG contributed to the supermutator phenotype and that most of the point mutations were caused by deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine, which remained uncorrected owing to the TDG deficiency. This case provides the first in vivo evidence of the key role of TDG in protecting the human genome against the deleterious effects of 5-methylcytosine deamination.",

     "abstract": "RECQL5 is one of the five human RecQ helicases, involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity. While much insight has been gained into the function of the Werner (WRN) and Bloom syndrome proteins (BLM), little is known about RECQL5. We have analyzed the recruitment and retention dynamics of RECQL5 at laser-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) relative to other human RecQ helicases. RECQL5-depleted cells accumulate persistent 53BP1 foci followed by \u03b3-irradiation, indicating a potential role of RECQL5 in the processing of DSBs. Real time imaging of live cells using confocal laser microscopy shows that RECQL5 is recruited early to laser-induced DSBs and remains for a shorter duration than BLM and WRN, but persist longer than RECQL4. These studies illustrate the differential involvement of RecQ helicases in the DSB repair process. Mapping of domains within RECQL5 that are necessary for recruitment to DSBs revealed that both the helicase and KIX domains are required for DNA damage recognition and stable association of RECQL5 to the DSB sites. Previous studies have shown that MRE11 is essential for the recruitment of RECQL5 to the DSB sites. Here we show that the recruitment of RECQL5 does not depend on the exonuclease activity of MRE11 or on active transcription by RNA polymerase II, one of the prominent interacting partners of RECQL5. Also, the recruitment of RECQL5 to laser-induced damage sites is independent of the presence of other DNA damage signaling and repair proteins BLM, WRN and ATM.",

     "abstract": "RECQ1 is the most abundant RecQ homolog in humans but its functions have remained mostly elusive. Biochemically, RECQ1 displays distinct substrate specificities from WRN and BLM, indicating that these RecQ helicases likely perform non-overlapping functions. Our earlier work demonstrated that RECQ1-deficient cells display spontaneous genomic instability. We have obtained key evidence suggesting a unique role of RECQ1 in repair of oxidative DNA damage. We show that similar to WRN, RECQ1 associates with PARP-1 in nuclear extracts and exhibits direct protein interaction in vitro. Deficiency in WRN or BLM helicases have been shown to result in reduced homologous recombination and hyperactivation of PARP under basal condition. However, RECQ1-deficiency did not lead to PARP activation in undamaged cells and nor did it result in reduction in homologous recombination repair. In stark contrast to what is seen in WRN-deficiency, RECQ1-deficient cells hyperactivate PARP in a specific response to H2O2 treatment. RECQ1-deficient cells are more sensitive to oxidative DNA damage and exposure to oxidative stress results in a rapid and reversible recruitment of RECQ1 to chromatin. Chromatin localization of RECQ1 precedes WRN helicase, which has been shown to function in oxidative DNA damage repair. However, oxidative DNA damage-induced chromatin recruitment of these RecQ helicases is independent of PARP activity. As other RecQ helicases are known to interact with PARP-1, this study provides a paradigm to delineate specialized and redundant functions of RecQ homologs in repair of oxidative DNA damage.",

PCNA-Ub is associated with the recruitment or activation of translesion synthesis (TLS) DNA polymerases of the Y family that can bypass the lesions, thereby rescuing replication and preventing replication fork collapse and consequent formation of double-strand DNA breaks. Here, we have used gene-targeted mouse embryonic fibroblasts to perform a comprehensive study of the in vivo roles of PCNA-Ub and of the Y family TLS Pols \u03b7, \u03b9, \u03ba, Rev1 and the B family TLS Pol\u03b6 in TLS and in the suppression of DNA damage signaling and genome instability after exposure to UV light. Our data indicate that TLS Pols \u03b9 and \u03ba and the N-terminal BRCT domain of Rev1, that previously was implicated in the regulation of TLS, play minor roles in TLS of DNA photoproducts. PCNA-Ub is critical for an early TLS pathway that replicates both strongly helix-distorting (6-4) pyrimidine\u2013pyrimidone ((6-4)PP) and mildly distorting cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) photoproducts. The role of Pol\u03b7 is mainly restricted to early TLS of CPD photoproducts, whereas Rev1 and, in particular, Pol\u03b6 are essential for the bypass of (6-4)PP photoproducts, both early and late after exposure. Thus, structurally distinct photoproducts at the mammalian genome are bypassed by different TLS Pols in temporally different, PCNA-Ub-dependent and independent fashions.",

     "abstract": "In human cell nuclei, UNG2 is the major uracil-DNA glycosylase initiating DNA base excision repair of uracil. In activated B cells it has an additional role in facilitating mutagenic processing of AID-induced uracil at Ig loci and UNG-deficient patients develop hyper-IgM syndrome characterized by impaired class-switch recombination and disturbed somatic hypermutation. How UNG2 is recruited to either error-free or mutagenic uracil processing remains obscure, but likely involves regulated interactions with other proteins. The UNG2 N-terminal domain contains binding motifs for both proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and replication protein A (RPA), but the relative contribution of these interactions to genomic uracil processing is not understood. Interestingly, a heterozygous germline single-nucleotide variant leading to Arg88Cys (R88C) substitution in the RPA-interaction motif of UNG2 has been observed in humans, but with unknown functional relevance. Here we demonstrate that UNG2-R88C protein is expressed from the variant allele in a lymphoblastoid cell line derived from a heterozygous germ line carrier. Enzyme activity as well as localization in replication foci of UNG2-R88C was similar to that of WT. However, binding to RPA was essentially abolished by the R88C substitution, whereas binding to PCNA was unaffected. Moreover, we show that disruption of the PCNA-binding motif impaired recruitment of UNG2 to S-phase replication foci, demonstrating that PCNA is a major factor for recruitment of UNG2 to unperturbed replication forks. Conversely, in cells treated with hydroxyurea, RPA mediated recruitment of UNG2 to stalled replication forks independently of functional PCNA binding. Modulation of PCNA- versus RPA-binding may thus constitute a functional switch for UNG2 in cells subsequent to genotoxic stress and potentially also during the processing of uracil at the immunoglobulin locus in antigen-stimulated B cells.",

DNA integrity is maintained by the coordinated action of DNA damage response mechanisms and DNA repair. In addition, there are also mechanisms of damage tolerance, such as translesion synthesis (TLS), which are important for survival after DNA damage but are potentially error-prone. Here, we investigate the role of DNA polymerase \u03ba (pol \u03ba) in TLS across alkylated lesions by silencing this polymerase (pol) in human cells using transient small RNA interference. We show that human pol \u03ba has a significant protective role against methyl nitrosourea (MNU)-associated cytotoxicity without affecting significantly mutagenicity. The increase in MNU-induced cytotoxicity when pol \u03ba is down-regulated was affected by the levels of O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase and fully abolished when mismatch repair (MMR) was defective. Following MNU treatment, the cell cycle profile was unaffected by the pol \u03ba status. The downregulation of pol \u03ba caused a severe delay in the onset of the second mitosis that was fully dependent on the presence of O6-methylguanine (O6-meGua) lesions. After MNU exposure, in the absence of pol \u03ba, the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges was unaffected whereas the induction of RAD 51 foci increased. We propose that pol \u03ba partially protects human cells from the MMR-dependent cytotoxicity of O6-meGua lesions by restoring the integrity of replicated duplexes containing single-stranded gaps generated opposite O6-meGua facilitated by RAD 51 binding.",

However, in B-cells, activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) generates U:G mismatches in hot-spot sequences at Ig loci. These are subject to mutagenic processing during somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). Uracil N-glycosylases UNG2 and SMUG1 (single strand-selective monofunctional uracil-DNA glycosylase 1) initiate error-free BER in most DNA contexts, but UNG2 is also involved in mutagenic processing of AID-induced uracil during the antibody diversification process, the regulation of which is not understood. AID is strictly single strand-specific. Here we show that in the presence of Mg2+ and monovalent salts, human and mouse SMUG1 are essentially double strand-specific, whereas UNG2 efficiently removes uracil from both single and double stranded DNA under all tested conditions. Furthermore, SMUG1 and UNG2 display widely different sequence preferences. Interestingly, uracil in a hot-spot sequence for AID is 200-fold more efficiently removed from single stranded DNA by UNG2 than by SMUG1. This may explain why SMUG1, which is not excluded from Ig loci, is unable to replace UNG2 in antibody diversification.

The human genome encodes nine AlkB homologs and the function of most of these is still unknown. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has two AlkB homologs and here we have addressed the function of one of these, Abh1, which appears not to possess a classical AlkB-like repair activity. No enzymatic activity was found toward methylated DNA or etheno adducts, nor was the yeast abh1\u2212 mutant sensitive toward alkylating agents. Interestingly, heterologous expression of E. coli AlkB protected the fission yeast cells from alkylation induced cytotoxicity, suggesting that S. pombe lacks systems for efficient repair of lesions that are AlkB substrates. Further, we show that Abh1 possesses an unexpected DNA incision activity at apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites. This AP lyase activity did not depend on 2OG and Fe(II) and was not repressed by dioxygenase inhibitors. Survival and complementation analyses failed to reveal any biological role for AP lyase cleavage by Abh1.

The frequency/distance relationships were obtained in crosses of the wild-type phage and of the amber mutant S17 (gene uvsX) and the double mutant S17 E727 (genes uvsX and 49). These data provide information about the frequency and distance distribution of the single-exchange (splices) and double-exchange (patches) events. The extended variant of the splice/patch coupling (SPC) model of recombination, which includes transition to the replication resolution (RR) alternative is substantiated and used for interpretation of the frequency/distance relationships. We conclude that the uvsX mutant executes recombination-dependent replication but does it by a qualitatively different way. In the absence of UvsX function, the DSB repair runs largely through the RR subpathway because of inability of the mutant to form a Holliday junction. In the two-factor crosses, the double uvsX 49\u2212 is recombinationally more proficient than the single uvsX mutant (partial suppression of the uvsX deficiency), while the patch-related double exchanges are virtually eliminated in this background.",

     "abstract": "Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) is the enzyme critically responsible for the production of the 5\u2032-deoxynucleoside-triphosphates (dNTPs), the direct precursors for DNA synthesis. The dNTP levels are tightly controlled to permit high efficiency and fidelity of DNA synthesis. Much of this control occurs at the level of the RNR by feedback processes, but a detailed understanding of these mechanisms is still lacking. Using a genetic approach in the bacterium Escherichia coli, a paradigm for the class Ia RNRs, we isolated 23 novel RNR mutants displaying elevated mutation rates along with altered dNTP levels. The responsible amino-acid substitutions in RNR reside in three different regions: (i) the (d)ATP-binding activity domain, (ii) a novel region in the small subunit adjacent to the activity domain, and (iii) the dNTP-binding specificity site, several of which are associated with different dNTP pool alterations and different mutational outcomes. These mutants provide new insight into the precise mechanisms by which RNR is regulated and how dNTP pool disturbances resulting from defects in RNR can lead to increased mutation.",

     "abstract": "Cockayne syndrome is a segmental progeria most often caused by mutations in the CSB gene encoding a SWI/SNF-like ATPase required for transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR). Over 43\u00a0Mya before marmosets diverged from humans, a piggyBac3 (PGBD3) transposable element integrated into intron 5 of the CSB gene. As a result, primate CSB genes now generate both CSB protein and a conserved CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein in which the first 5 exons of CSB are alternatively spliced to the PGBD3 transposase. Using a host cell reactivation assay, we show that the fusion protein inhibits TCR of oxidative damage but facilitates TCR of UV damage. We also show by microarray analysis that expression of the fusion protein alone in CSB-null UV-sensitive syndrome (UVSS) cells induces an interferon-like response that resembles both the innate antiviral response and the prolonged interferon response normally maintained by unphosphorylated STAT1 (U-STAT1); moreover, as might be expected based on conservation of the fusion protein, this potentially cytotoxic interferon-like response is largely reversed by coexpression of functional CSB protein. Interestingly, expression of CSB and the CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein together, but neither alone, upregulates the insulin growth factor binding protein IGFBP5 and downregulates IGFBP7, suggesting that the fusion protein may also confer a metabolic advantage, perhaps in the presence of DNA damage. Finally, we show that the fusion protein binds in vitro to members of a dispersed family of 900 internally deleted piggyBac elements known as MER85s, providing a potential mechanism by which the fusion protein could exert widespread effects on gene expression. Our data suggest that the CSB-PGBD3 fusion protein is important in both health and disease, and could play a role in Cockayne syndrome.",

If left unrepaired, some of the damage can be cytotoxic and/or mutagenic. In Escherichia coli, the alkylation repair protein B (AlkB) provides one form of resistance to alkylating agents by eliminating mainly 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine, thereby increasing survival and preventing mutation. To examine the biological role of the mammalian AlkB homologs Alkbh2 and Alkbh3, which both have similar enzymatic activities to that of AlkB, we evaluated the survival and mutagenesis of primary Big Blue mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that had targeted deletions in the Alkbh2 or Alkbh3 genes. Both Alkbh2- and Alkbh3-deficient MEFs were \u223c2-fold more sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) induced cytotoxicity compared to the wild type control cells.

However, despite the similar survival of the two mutant MEFs after MMS treatment, only the Alkbh2-deficient MEFs showed a statistically significant increase in mutant frequency compared to wild type MEFs after MMS treatment.

Previously, we reported that in response to densely ionizing radiation CDKN1A rapidly is recruited to the sites of particle traversal, and that CDKN1A foci formation in response to heavy ions is independent of its transactivation by TP53. Here, we show that exposure of normal human fibroblasts to X-rays or to H2O2 also induces nuclear accumulations of CDKN1A. We find that CDKN1A foci formation in response to radiation damage is dependent on its dephosphorylation and on its direct physical interaction with PCNA. Live cell imaging analyses of ectopically expressed EGFP-CDKN1A and dsRed-PCNA show rapid recruitment of both proteins into foci after radiation damage. Detailed dynamic measurements reveal a slightly delayed recruitment of CDKN1A compared to PCNA, which is best described by bi-exponential curve fitting, taking the preceding binding of PCNA to DNA into account. We propose a regulatory role for CDKN1A in mediating PCNA function after radiation damage, and provide evidence that this role is distinct from its involvement in nucleotide excision repair and unrelated to double-strand break repair.",

Although genetic analysis has been useful to interrogate the aging process, there has been both interest and debate over how functionally conserved the mechanisms of aging are between yeast and higher eukaryotes, especially mammalian cells. One area of interest has been the importance of genomic stability for age-related processes, and the potential conservation of proteins and pathways between yeast and human. Translational genetics have been employed to examine the functional roles of mammalian proteins using yeast as a pliable model system.

DSBs repair mainly occurs via the RecFOR pathway in Deinococcus radiodurans, a well-known radiation-resistant bacterium. A recJ null mutant was constructed to investigate the role of recJ in D. radiodurans. recJ inactivation caused growth defects and sensitivity to high temperatures. However, the radiation resistance of the recJ mutant was only moderately decreased. The full-length D. radiodurans RecJ (DrRecJ) protein was expressed and purified to further characterize its biochemical properties. DrRecJ possessed a Mn2+ concentration-dependent nuclease activity where the optimal Mn2+ concentration was 0.1\u00a0mM. DrRecJ had a similar activity profile after adding 10\u00a0mM Mg2+ to reactions with different Mn2+ concentrations, indicating that Mn2+ is a RecJ regulator. Escherichia coli RecJ has no activity on 5\u2032 ssDNA tails shorter than 6-nt, but DrRecJ could effectively degrade DNA with a 4-nt 5\u2032 ssDNA tail, suggesting that DrRecJ may have a wider range of DNA substrates. Moreover, SSB in D. radiodurans stimulated the DrRecJ exonuclease activity, whereas DdrB inhibited it and provided protection to ssDNA. Overall, our results indicate that recJ is a nonessential gene in D. radiodurans and that the activity of DrRecJ is regulated by Mn2+ and SSB-DdrB.",

Oligonucleotides with single uracil residues in certain positions were annealed with complementary oligonucleotides bearing either a cis- or trans-BP adduct. The resulting DNA duplexes contained dU either directly opposite the modified dG or shifted to adjacent 5\u2032 (\u22121) or 3\u2032 (+1) positions. Digestion with uracil DNA glycosylase was utilized to generate AP sites which were then hydrolyzed by APE1, and the resulting gaps were processed by DNA polymerase \u03b2 (Pol\u03b2) or \u03bb (Pol\u03bb). The AP sites in position \u22121 can be repaired effectively using APE1 and Pol\u03b2 or Pol\u03bb. The AP sites opposite the BP lesions can be repaired using Pol\u03bb in the case of cis- but not the trans-isomeric adduct. The AP sites in position +1 are the most difficult to repair. In the case of the AP site located in position +1, the activity of Pol\u03bb does not depend on the stereoisomeric properties of the BP lesions and dCTP is the preferred inserted substrate in both cases. The capability of Pol\u03bb to introduce the correct dNTP opposite the cis-BP-dG adduct in gap filling reactions suggests that this polymerase may play a specialized role in the process of repair of these kinds of lesions.",

To identify functions of the Y-family DNA polymerase Dbh in replicating the Sulfolobus genome under extreme conditions, we disrupted the dbh gene in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and characterized the resulting mutant strains phenotypically. Disruption of dbh did not cause any obvious growth defect, sensitivity to any of several DNA-damaging agents, or change in overall rate of spontaneous mutation at a well-characterized target gene. Loss of dbh did, however, cause significant changes in the spectrum of spontaneous forward mutation in each of two orthologous target genes of different sequence. Relative to wild-type strains, dbh\u2212 constructs exhibited fewer frame-shift and other small insertion-deletion mutations, but exhibited more base-pair substitutions that converted G:C base pairs to T:A base pairs. These changes, which were confirmed to be statistically significant, indicate two distinct activities of the Dbh polymerase in Sulfolobus cells growing under nearly optimal culture conditions (78\u201380\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 3). The first activity promotes slipped-strand events within simple repetitive motifs, such as mononucleotide runs or triplet repeats, and the second promotes insertion of C opposite a potentially miscoding form of G, thereby avoiding G:C to T:A transversions.",

In this study we showed that both the transcription and protein levels of hNEIL3 fluctuated during the cell cycle. Based on predicted promoter elements of cell cycle-regulated genes and microarray data from various reports, we suggest that hNEIL3 repression in quiescent cells might be mediated by the DREAM (DP1, RB p130, E2F4 and MuvB core complex) complex. Release from G0 by mitogenic stimulation showed an induction of hNEIL3 in early S phase under the control of the Ras dependent ERK\u2013MAP kinase pathway. In contrast, the total expression of hNEIL1 was downregulated upon release from quiescence while the expression of hNEIL2 was cell cycle independent. Notably, hNEIL3 showed a similar regulation pattern as the replication protein hFEN1 supporting a function of hNEIL3 in replication associated repair. Thus, it appears that specialized functions of the NEILs are ensured by their expression patterns.",

Although the D. radiodurans genome is clearly devoid of recBC and addAB counterparts as RecA mediators, the genome possesses all genes associated with the RecFOR pathway. In an effort to gain insights into the role of D. radiodurans RecFOR proteins in homologous recombination, we generated recF, recO and recR disruptant strains and characterized the disruption effects. All the disruptant strains exhibited delayed growth relative to the wild-type, indicating that the RecF, RecO and RecR proteins play an important role in cell growth under normal growth conditions. A slight reduction in transformation efficiency was observed in the recF and recO disruptant strains compared to the wild-type strain. Interestingly, disruption of recR resulted in severe reduction of the transformation efficiency. On the other hand, the recF disruptant strain was the most sensitive phenotype to \u03b3 rays, UV irradiation and mitomycin C among the three disruptants. In the recF disruptant strain, the intracellular level of the LexA1 protein did not decrease following \u03b3 irradiation, suggesting that a large amount of the RecA protein remains inactive despite being induced. These results demonstrate that the RecF protein plays a crucial role in the homologous recombination repair process by facilitating RecA activation in D. radiodurans. Thus, the RecF and RecR proteins are involved in the RecA activation and the stability of incoming DNA, respectively, during RecA-mediated homologous recombination processes that initiated the ESDSA pathway in D. radiodurans. Possible mechanisms that involve the RecFOR complex in homologous intermolecular recombination and homologous recombination repair processes are also discussed.",

     "abstract": "In recBCD sbcB sbcC(D) mutants of Escherichia coli homologous recombination proceeds via RecF pathway, which is thought to require RecQ, UvrD and HelD helicases at its initial stage. It was previously suggested that depletion of all three helicases totally abolishes the RecF pathway. The present study (re)examines the roles of these helicases in transductional recombination, and in recombinational repair of UV-induced DNA damage in the RecF pathway. The study has employed the \u0394recBCD \u0394sbcB sbcC201 and \u0394recBCD sbcB15 sbcC201 strains, carrying combinations of mutations in recQ, uvrD, and helD genes. We show that in \u0394recBCD \u0394sbcB sbcC201 strains, recombination requires exclusively the RecQ helicase. In \u0394recBCD sbcB15 sbcC201 strains, RecQ may be partially substituted by UvrD helicase. The HelD helicase is dispensable for recombination in both backgrounds. Our results also suggest that significant portion of recombination events in the RecF pathway is independent of RecQ, UvrD and HelD. These events are initiated either by RecJ nuclease alone or by RecJ nuclease associated with an unknown helicase. Inactivation of exonuclease VII by a xseA mutation further decreases the requirement for helicase activity in the RecF pathway. We suggest that elimination of nucleases acting on 3\u2032 single-strand DNA ends reduces the necessity for helicases in initiation of recombination.",

Biochemical characterization of pol V has been hindered by the fact that the enzyme is notoriously difficult to purify, largely because overproduced UmuC is insoluble. Here, we report a simple and efficient protocol for the rapid purification of milligram quantities of pol V from just 4\u00a0L of bacterial culture. Rather than over producing the UmuC protein, it was expressed at low basal levels, while Umu D \u2032 2 was expressed in trans from a high copy-number plasmid with an inducible promoter. We have also developed strategies to purify the \u03b2-clamp and \u03b3-clamp loader free from contaminating polymerases. Using these highly purified proteins, we determined the cofactor requirements for optimal activity of pol V in vitro and found that pol V shows robust activity on an SSB-coated circular DNA template in the presence of the \u03b2/\u03b3-complex and a RecA nucleoprotein filament (RecA*) formed in trans. This strong activity was attributed to the unexpectedly high processivity of pol V Mut ( Umu D \u2032 2 C \u22c5 RecA \u22c5 ATP ), which was efficiently recruited to a primer terminus by SSB.",

     "abstract": "The resection of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to generate ssDNA tails is a pivotal event in the cellular response to these breaks. In the two-step model of resection, primarily elucidated in yeast, initial resection by Mre11-CtIP is followed by extensive resection by two distinct pathways involving Exo1 or BLM/WRN-Dna2. However, resection pathways and their exact contributions in humans in vivo are not as clearly worked out as in yeast. Here, we examined the contribution of Exo1 to DNA end resection in humans in vivo in response to ionizing radiation (IR) and its relationship with other resection pathways (Mre11-CtIP or BLM/WRN). We find that Exo1 plays a predominant role in resection in human cells along with an alternate pathway dependent on WRN. While Mre11 and CtIP stimulate resection in human cells, they are not absolutely required for this process and Exo1 can function in resection even in the absence of Mre11-CtIP. Interestingly, the recruitment of Exo1 to DNA breaks appears to be inhibited by the NHEJ protein Ku80, and the higher level of resection that occurs upon siRNA-mediated depletion of Ku80 is dependent on Exo1. In addition, Exo1 may be regulated by 53BP1 and Brca1, and the restoration of resection in BRCA1-deficient cells upon depletion of 53BP1 is dependent on Exo1. Finally, we find that Exo1-mediated resection facilitates a transition from ATM- to ATR-mediated cell cycle checkpoint signaling. Our results identify Exo1 as a key mediator of DNA end resection and DSB repair and damage signaling decisions in human cells.",

     "abstract": "Formaldehyde is a reactive chemical that is commonly used in the production of industrial, laboratory, household, and cosmetic products. The causal association between formaldehyde exposure and increased incidence of cancer led the International Agency for Research on Cancer to classify formaldehyde as a carcinogen. Formaldehyde-induced DNA\u2013protein crosslinks (DPCs) elicit responses involving nucleotide excision repair (NER) and homologous recombination (HR) repair pathways; however, little is known about the cellular and genetic changes that subsequently lead to formaldehyde-induced genotoxic and cytotoxic effects. Herein, investigations of genes that modulate the cytotoxic effects of formaldehyde exposure revealed that of five NER-deficient Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines tested, XPF- and ERCC1-deficient cells were most sensitive to formaldehyde treatment as compared to wild-type cells. Cell cycle analyses revealed that formaldehyde-treated XPF-deficient cells exhibited an immediate G2/M arrest that was associated with altered cell ploidy and apoptosis. Additionally, an elevated number of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), chromosomal breaks and radial formation were also observed in XPF-deficient cells following formaldehyde treatment. Formaldehyde-induced DSBs occurred in a replication-dependent, but an XPF-independent manner. However, delayed DSB repair was observed in the absence of XPF function. Collectively, our findings highlight the role of an XPF-dependent pathway in mitigating the sensitivity to formaldehyde-induced DNA damage as evidenced by the increased genomic instability and reduced cell viability in an XPF-deficient background. In addition, centrosome and microtubule abnormalities, as well as enlarged nuclei, caused by formaldehyde exposure are demonstrated in a repair-proficient cell line.",

However, the mechanisms responsible for its cytotoxicity are not fully understood. From the phenotypic analysis of mutant chicken B lymphoma DT40 cells, we found that homologous recombinational repair (HRR), involving Rad54 and BRCA2, and the ATR\u2013Chk1 signaling pathway, involving Rad9 and Rad17, significantly contribute to 5-FU tolerance. 5-FU induced \u03b3H2AX nuclear foci, which were colocalized with the key HRR factor Rad51, but not with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), in a dose-dependent manner as cells accumulated in the S phase. Inhibition of Chk1 kinase by UCN-01 increased 5-FU-induced \u03b3H2AX and enhanced 5-FU cytotoxicity not only in wild-type cells but also in Rad54- or BRCA2-deficient cells, suggesting that HRR and Chk1 kinase have non-overlapping roles in 5-FU tolerance. 5-FU-induced Chk1 phosphorylation was significantly impaired in Rad9- or Rad17-deficient cells, and severe \u03b3H2AX nuclear foci and DSBs were formed, which was followed by apoptosis. Finally, inhibition of Chk1 kinase by UCN-01 increased 5-FU-induced \u03b3H2AX nuclear foci and enhanced 5-FU cytotoxicity in Rad9- or Rad17-deficient cells. These results suggest that Rad9- and Rad17-independent activation of the ATR\u2013Chk1 signaling pathway also significantly contributes to 5-FU tolerance.",

     "abstract": "O6-Methylguanine produced in DNA by the action of simple alkylating agents, such as N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), causes base-mispairing during DNA replication, thus leading to mutations and cancer. To prevent such outcomes, the cells carrying O6-methylguanine undergo apoptosis in a mismatch repair protein-dependent manner. We previously identified MAPO1 as one of the components required for the induction of apoptosis triggered by O6-methylguanine. MAPO1, also known as FNIP2 and FNIPL, forms a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and folliculin (FLCN), which is encoded by the BHD tumor suppressor gene. We describe here the involvement of the AMPK\u2013MAPO1\u2013FLCN complex in the signaling pathway of apoptosis induced by O6-methylguanine. By the introduction of siRNAs specific for these genes, the transition of cells to a population with sub-G1 DNA content following MNU treatment was significantly suppressed. After MNU exposure, phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b1 occurred in an MLH1-dependent manner, and this activation of AMPK was not observed in cells in which the expression of either the Mapo1 or the Flcn gene was downregulated. When cells were treated with AICA-ribose (AICAR), a specific activator of AMPK, activation of AMPK was also observed in a MAPO1- and FLCN-dependent manner, thus leading to cell death which was accompanied by the depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane, a hallmark of the apoptosis induction. It is therefore likely that MAPO1, in its association with FLCN, may regulate the activation of AMPK to control the induction of apoptosis triggered by O6-methylguanine.",

In contrast, 14-3-3 proteins are regulatory phosphorserine/threonine binding proteins involved in the control of diverse cellular events, including cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis signaling. hEXO1 is regulated by post-translation Ser/Thr phosphorylation in a yet not fully clarified manner, but evidently three phosphorylation sites are specifically induced by replication inhibition leading to protein ubiquitination and degradation. We demonstrate direct and robust interaction between hEXO1 and six of the seven 14-3-3 isoforms in vitro, suggestive of a novel protein interaction network between DNA repair and cell cycle control. Binding experiments reveal weak affinity of the more selective isoform 14-3-3\u03c3 but both 14-3-3 isoforms \u03b7 and \u03c3 significantly stimulate hEXO1 activity, indicating that these regulatory proteins exert a common regulation mode on hEXO1. Results demonstrate that binding involves the phosphorable amino acid S746 in hEXO1 and most likely a second unidentified binding motif. 14-3-3 associations do not appear to directly influence hEXO1 in vitro nuclease activity or in vitro DNA replication initiation. Moreover, specific phosphorylation variants, including hEXO1 S746A, are efficiently imported to the nucleus; to associate with PCNA in distinct replication foci and respond to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), indicating that 14-3-3 binding does not involve regulating the subcellular distribution of hEXO1. Altogether, these results suggest that association may be related to regulation of hEXO1 availability during the DNA damage response to plausibly prevent extensive DNA resection at the damage site, as supported by recent studies.",

The 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) and MutY homolog 1 (MYH) synergistically prevent mutagenesis and cancer formation in mice. Their localization in the mitochondria as well as in the nucleus suggests that mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) contribute to the carcinogenesis in the myh\u2212/\u2212/ogg1\u2212/\u2212 double knockout mouse.In order to test this hypothesis, we analyzed mtDNA mutagenesis and mitochondrial function in young (1\u00a0month) and adult (6\u00a0months) wt and myh\u2212/\u2212/ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice. To our surprise, the absence of OGG1 and MYH had no impact on mtDNA mutation rates in these mice, even at the onset of cancer. This indicates that mtDNA mutagenesis is not responsible for the carcinogenesis of myh\u2212/\u2212/ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In line with these results, mitochondrial function was unaffected in the cancerous tissues liver and lung, whereas a significant reduction in respiration capacity was observed in brain mitochondria from the adult myh\u2212/\u2212/ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mouse. The reduced respiration capacity correlated with a specific reduction (\u221225%) in complex I biochemical activity in brain mitochondria.Our results demonstrate that mtDNA mutations are not associated with cancer development in myh\u2212/\u2212/ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice, and that impairment of mitochondrial function in brain could be linked to nuclear DNA mutations in this strain.

Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we directly visualize and compare binding of Bax1 and XPB/Bax1 to different DNA substrates.

These data led us to investigate genetic interactions between Apn1p, Apn2p and DNA damage checkpoint proteins. The results show that mec1 sml1, rad53 sml1 and rad9 is synthetic lethal with apn1 apn2. In contrast, apn1 apn2 rad17, apn1 apn2 ddc1 and apn1 apn2 rad24 triple mutants are viable, although they exhibit a strong CanR spontaneous mutator phenotype. In these strains, high CanR mutation rate is dependent upon functional uracil DNA N-glycosylase (Ung1p) and mutation spectra are dominated by AT to CG events. The results point to a role for Rad17\u2013Mec3\u2013Ddc1 (9\u20131\u20131) checkpoint clamp in the prevention of mutations caused by abasic (AP) sites linked to incorporation of dUTP into DNA followed by the excision of uracil by Ung1p. The antimutator role of the (9\u20131\u20131) clamp can either rely on its essential function in the induction of the DNA damage checkpoint or to another function that specifically impacts DNA repair and/or mutagenesis at AP sites. Here, we show that the abrogation of the DNA damage checkpoint is not sufficient to enhance spontaneous mutagenesis in the apn1 apn2 rad9 sml1 quadruple mutant. Spontaneous mutagenesis was also explored in strains deficient in the two major DNA N-glycosylases/AP-lyases (Ntg1p and Ntg2p). Indeed, apn1 apn2 ntg1 ntg2 exhibits a strong Ung1p-dependent CanR mutator phenotype with a spectrum enriched in AT to CG, like apn1 apn2 rad17. However, genetic analysis reveals that ntg1 ntg2 and rad17 are not epistatic for spontaneous mutagenesis in apn1 apn2. We conclude that under normal growth conditions, dUTP incorporation into DNA is a major source of AP sites that cause high genetic instability in the absence of BER factors (Apn1p, Apn2p, Ntg1p and Ntg2p) and Rad17\u2013Mec3\u2013Ddc1 (9\u20131\u20131) checkpoint clamp in yeast.",

While it controls genotoxic stress responses such as cell cycle arrest, replication fork stabilization and increase in dNTP pools, little is known about the consequences of reduced Rad53 levels on the various cellular endpoints or about its roles in dealing with chronic vs. acute genotoxic challenges. Using a tetraploid gene dosage model in which only one copy of the yeast RAD53 is functional (simplex), we found that the simplex strain was not sensitive to acute UV radiation or chronic MMS exposure. However, the simplex strain was sensitized to chronic exposure of the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU). Surprisingly, reduced RAD53 gene dosage did not affect sensitivity to HU acute exposure, indicating that immediate checkpoint responses and recovery from HU-induced stress were not compromised. Interestingly, cells of most of the colonies that arise after chronic HU exposure acquired heritable resistance to HU. We also found that short HU exposure before and after treatment of G2 cells with ionizing radiation (IR) reduced the capability of RAD53 simplex cells to repair DSBs, in agreement with sensitivity of RAD53 simplex strain to high doses of IR. We propose that a modest reduction in Rad53 activity can impact the activation of the ribonucleotide reductase catalytic subunit Rnr1 following stress, reducing the ability to generate nucleotide pools sufficient for DNA repair and replication. At the same time, reduced Rad53 activity may lead to genome instability and to the acquisition of drug resistance before and/or during the chronic exposure to HU. These results have implications for developing drug enhancers as well as for understanding mechanisms of drug resistance in cells compromised for DNA damage checkpoint.",

However, how Mdm2 is regulated in response to various stresses is not well understood. In this study, we found that Mdm2 was stabilized and upregulated upon Actinomycin D (ActD) treatment in the p53-deficient H1299 cell line. This Mdm2 upregulation was not dependent on the ribosomal protein L11, an essential player in ribosomal stress-induced p53 activation, but did require a NEDDylation-dependent mechanism. We further demonstrated that the ActD-induced Mdm2 stabilization may be modulated by the cell growth signaling, and that knockdown of Mdm2 enhanced ActD-induced cell death in H1299 cells. These results suggested a role of Mdm2 in the ribosomal stress response in the p53 deficient cells, which could be exploited in therapeutic use for treating cancers harboring p53 mutations.",

The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has a conserved set of NHEJ factors including Ku, DNA ligase IV, Xlf1, and Pol4. Their roles in chromosomal DSB repair have not been directly characterized before. Here we used HO endonuclease to create a specific chromosomal DSB in fission yeast and examined the imprecise end joining events allowing cells to survive the continuous expression of HO. Our analysis showed that cell survival was significantly reduced in mutants defective for Ku, ligase IV, or Xlf1. Using Sanger sequencing and Illumina sequencing, we have characterized in depth the repair junction sequences in HO survivors. In wild type cells the majority of repair events were one-nucleotide insertions dependent on Ku, ligase IV, and Pol4. Our data suggest that fission yeast Pol4 is important for gap filling during NHEJ repair and can extend primers in the absence of terminal base pairing with the templates. In Ku and ligase IV mutants, the survivors mainly resulted from two types of alternative end joining events: one used microhomology flanking the HO site to delete sequences of hundreds to thousands of base pairs, the other rejoined the break using the HO-generated overhangs but also introduced one- or two-nucleotide base substitutions. The chromosomal repair assay we describe here should provide a useful tool for further exploration of the end joining repair mechanisms in fission yeast.",

Deinococcal PprI serves as a general switch to regulate the expression of dozens of proteins from different pathways after radiation, including the DNA repair proteins RecA, PprA and SSB. However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed the dynamic alteration in global transcriptional profiles in wildtype and pprI mutant strains by combining microarrays and time-course sampling. We found that PprI up-regulated transcription of at least 210 genes after radiation, including 21 DNA repair and replication-related genes. We purified PprI and a helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain mutant and found that PprI specifically bound to the promoters of recA and pprA in vitro but did not bind nonspecific double-strand DNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays confirmed that PprI specifically interacted with the promoter DNA of recA and pprA after radiation. Finally, we showed that a DNA-binding activity-deficient pprI mutant only partially restored resistance of the pprI mutant strain to \u03b3 radiation, UV radiation, and mitomycin C.

As a potent HDAC inhibitor, depsipeptide not only modulates histone deacetylation but also activates non-histone protein p53 to inhibit cancer cell growth. However, the mechanism of depsipeptide-induced p53 transactivity remains unknown. Here, we show that depsipeptide causes DNA damage through induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, as demonstrated by a comet assay and by detection of the phosphorylation of H2AX. Depsipeptide induced oxidative stress was confirmed to relate to a disturbance in reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions through inhibition of the transactivation of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in human cancer cells. Upon treatment with depsipeptide, p53 phosphorylation at threonine 18 (Thr18) was specifically induced. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that phosphorylation of p53 at Thr18 is required for p53 acetylation at lysine 373/382 and for p21 expression in response to depsipeptide treatment.

Here we report the identification and functional characterization of two zebrafish UEV genes, Drmms2 and Druev1. Their deduced amino acid sequences indicate that the two UEV genes evolved separately prior to the appearance of vertebrates. Both zebrafish Uevs form a stable complex with DrUbc13 as well as Ubc13s from yeast and human, and are able to promote Ubc13-mediated K63 polyubiquitination in vitro, suggesting that their biochemical activities are conserved. Despite the fact that both zebrafish UEV genes can functionally replace the yeast MMS2 DNA-damage tolerance function, they exhibited differences in DNA-damage response in zebrafish embryos: ablation of DrMms2, but not DrUev1, enhances both spontaneous and DNA-damage induced expression of p53 effectors p21 and mdm2.

     "abstract": "p63 and p73, two p53 family members, play crucial roles in development and tumor suppression. p63 and p73 have multiple isoforms, which have similar or distinct biological functions. Transactivation (TA) isoforms of p63 and p73 have high similarity with p53 and often have biological functions similar to p53. p53 plays an important role in nucleotide excision repair (NER) through transcriptional regulation of target genes involved in NER, including DDB2, XPC and GADD45. To investigate whether TAp63 and TAp73 play a similar role in NER, Saos2 cells with inducible expression of specific isoforms of TAp63 and TAp73, including TAp63\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 and TAp73\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 isoforms, were employed. Overexpression of TAp63\u03b3 significantly enhances NER of ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage, including cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6\u20134 photoproducts, and enhances cell survival after UV irradiation in Soas2 cells. The enhancement of NER of UV-induced DNA damage by TAp63\u03b3 was also confirmed in H1299 cells with overexpression of TAp63\u03b3. Consistently, knockdown of endogenous TAp63 decreases NER of UV-induced DNA damage in H1299 cells. TAp63\u03b1/\u03b2 and TAp73\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 isoforms do not have a clear effect on NER in Saos2 or H1299 cells. TAp63\u03b3 overexpression clearly induces the expression of DDB2, XPC and GADD45 at both RNA and protein levels. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assays show that TAp63\u03b3 transcriptionally activates DDB2, XPC and GADD45 genes through the regulation of the p53 binding elements in these genes. These results demonstrate that TAp63\u03b3 enhances NER to remove UV-induced DNA damage and maintain genomic stability through transcriptional induction of a set of NER proteins, which provides an additional important mechanism that contributes to the function of TAp63 in tumor suppression.",

Thus, the pathways by which PolH expression and activity are controlled may be explored as a strategy to prevent UV-induced cancer.

Specifically, we showed that knockdown of Mdm2 increases PolH expression in both p53-proficient and -deficient cells. In addition, we showed that UV-induced PolH degradation is attenuated by Mdm2 knockdown. In contrast, ectopically expression of Mdm2 decreases PolH expression, which can be abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Moreover, we showed that Mdm2 physically associates with PolH and promotes PolH polyubiquitination in vivo and in vitro. Finally, we showed that knockdown of Mdm2 increases the formation of PolH replication foci and decreases the sensitivity of cells to UV-induced lesions in a PolH-dependent manner.

It has been reported that filamin-A interacts with DNA damage response proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2. Defects of filamin-A impair the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), resulting in sensitization of cells to ionizing radiation. In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that filamin-A can be used as a target for cancer chemotherapy and as a biomarker to predict cancer response to therapeutic DNA damage. We found that reduction of filamin-A sensitizes cancer cells to chemotherapy reagents bleomycin and cisplatin, delays the repair of not only DSBs but also single strand breaks (SSBs) and interstrand crosslinks (ICLs), and increases chromosome breaks after the drug treatment. By treating a panel of human melanoma cell lines with variable filamin-A expression, we observed a correlation between expression level of filamin-A protein and drug IC50. We further inhibited the expression of filamin-A in melanoma cells, and found that this confers an increased sensitivity to bleomycin and cisplatin treatment in a mouse xenograft tumor model. These results suggest that filamin-A plays a role in repair of a variety of DNA damage, that lack of filamin-A is a prognostic marker for a better outcome after DNA damage based treatment, and filamin-A can be inhibited to sensitize filamin-A positive cancer cells to therapeutic DNA damage.

Increasing evidence suggests that formation of a stable DNA hairpin within CAG/CTG repeats during DNA metabolism leads to TNR instability. However, the molecular mechanism by which cells recognize and repair CAG/CTG hairpins is largely unknown. Recent studies have identified a novel DNA repair pathway specifically removing (CAG)n/(CTG)n hairpins, which is considered a major mechanism responsible for TNR instability. The hairpin repair (HPR) system targets the repeat tracts for incisions in the nicked strand in an error-free manner. To determine the substrate spectrum of the HPR system and its ability to process smaller hairpins, which may be the intermediates for CAG/CTG expansions, we constructed a series of CAG/CTG hairpin heteroduplexes containing different numbers of repeats (from 5 to 25) and examined their repair in human nuclear extracts. We show here that although repair efficiencies differ slightly among these substrates, removal of the individual hairpin structures all involve endonucleolytic incisions within the repeat tracts in the nicked DNA strand. Analysis of the repair intermediates defined specific incision sites for each substrate, which were all located within the repeat regions. Mismatch repair proteins are not required for, nor do they inhibit, the processing of smaller hairpin structures. These results suggest that the HPR system ensures CAG/CTG stability primarily by removing various sizes of (CAG)n/(CTG)n hairpin structures during DNA metabolism.",

Whether these two DNA damage response components interact to prevent neuropathology is largely unknown. Here we show that a deletion of Nbs1 or Atr in the mouse central nervous system (CNS) results in neurodevelopmental defects characterized by reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in embryonic brains. In contrast to Nbs1, deletion of Atr alone and both Nbs1 and Atr in the CNS causes early postnatal lethality, indicating a wider function of Atr. Importantly, deletion of Nbs1 and Atr together results in dramatic proliferation defects in neuroprogenitors. Whereas most apoptosis in the Nbs1-deleted cortex is restricted to the highly proliferating progenitors, Atr knockout induces apoptosis in both proliferating and non-proliferating neural cells. Consistently, an inducible deletion of Atr or Nbs1\u2013Atr, but not of Nbs1, triggers a p53-independent cell death pathway in differentiated neurons, albeit elevated DNA damage in Nbs1 null neurons.

Pol \u03bc has been shown to participate in DNA synthesis at junctions in vitro, including on unpaired substrates, and to promote annealing. However, the phenotypes observed in vivo poorly recapitulate the functions of pol \u03bc reported in vitro. We analysed the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in a cellular context using improved NHEJ substrates. These substrates do not replicate in mammalian cells, thereby result in clonal repair events, which allows the measure of the efficiency of repair. We validated this paradigm by comparing the repair of NHEJ substrates to the repair reported for chromosome DSBs in mouse cells. Molecular analysis and, in most cases sequencing of more than 1500 repair events on a variety of NHEJ substrates in wild type and pol \u03bc\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts shows that, unexpectedly, the absence of pol \u03bc decreases the efficiency of joining of all types of DSBs, including those that do not undergo end-processing. Importantly, by reducing the efficiency of accurate events, lack of pol \u03bc also affects the overall fidelity of the repair process. We also show that, although pol \u03bc does not help protect DNA ends from resection, the efficiency of repair of resected ends is reduced in the absence of pol \u03bc. Interestingly, the DNA synthesis activity of pol \u03bc, including on non-aligned substrates, appears negligible at least in a cellular context.

This telomere-initiated cellular senescence occurs because cells have halted production of telomerase, a DNA polymerase required for stabilization of chromosome ends. Telomerase-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells undergo a similar process, with most cells arresting growth after approximately 60 generations. In the current study we demonstrate that senescence is largely reversible. Reactivation of telomerase (EST2) expression in the growth-arrested cells led to resumption of cycling and reversal of senescent cell characteristics. Rescue was also observed after mating of senescent haploid cells with telomerase-proficient cells to form stable diploids. Although senescence was reversible in DNA damage checkpoint response mutants (mec3 and/or rad24 cells), survival of recombination-defective rad52 mutants remained low after telomerase reactivation. Telomere lengths in rescued est2 cells were initially half those of wildtype cells, but could be restored to normal by propagation for \u223c70 generations in the presence of telomerase. These results place limitations on possible models for senescence and indicate that most cells, despite gross morphological changes and short, resected telomeres, do not experience lethal DNA damage and become irreversibly committed to death.",

Notably, we find that in vitro, the non-enzymatic binding of AAG to \u025bC specifically blocks ALKBH2-catalyzed repair of \u025bC but not that of methylated ALKBH2 substrates. These results identify human ALKBH2 as a repair enzyme for mutagenic \u025bC lesions and highlight potential consequences for substrate-binding overlap between the base excision and direct reversal DNA repair pathways.",

As part of the cellular defenses to DNA damage, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases repair the abasic sites produced by spontaneous hydrolysis, oxidative or alkylation base damage and during base excision repair (BER). Trypanosoma brucei, the protozoan pathogen responsible of human sleeping sickness, has a class II AP endonuclease (TBAPE1) with a high degree of homology to human APE1 and bacterial exonuclease III. The purified recombinant enzyme cleaves AP sites and removes 3\u2032-phosphoglycolate groups from 3\u2032-ends. To study its cellular function, we have established TBAPE1-deficient cell lines derived from bloodstream stage trypanosomes, thus confirming that the AP endonuclease is not essential for viability in this cell type under in vitro culture conditions. The role of TBAPE1 in the removal of AP sites is supported by the inverse correlation between the level of AP endonuclease in the cell and the number of endogenously generated abasic sites in its genomic DNA. Furthermore, depletion of TBAPE1 renders cells hypersensitive to AP site and strand break-inducing agents such as methotrexate and phleomycin respectively but not to alkylating agents. Finally, the increased susceptibility that TBAPE1-depleted cells show to nitric oxide suggests an essential role for this DNA repair enzyme in protection against the immune defenses of the mammalian host.",

TREX1 is a member of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated SET complex and participates in granzyme A-mediated cell death to degrade nicked genomic DNA.

The TREX1 D18N and V201D mutants are able to bind both metals in the active site, but with inter-metal distances that are larger than optimal for catalysis. Additionally, all of the mutant structures reveal a reduced mobility in the catalytic histidine, providing further explanation for the loss of catalytic activity.

During the repair of DSBs by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), DNA ends are brought together, processed and then joined. In eukaryotes, this repair pathway is initiated by the binding of the ring-shaped Ku heterodimer and completed by DNA ligase IV. The DNA ligase IV complex, DNA ligase IV/XRRC4 in humans and Dnl4/Lif1 in yeast, is recruited to DNA ends in vitro and in vivo by an interaction with Ku and, in yeast, Dnl4/Lif1 stabilizes the binding of yKu to in vivo DSBs. Here we have analyzed the interactions of these functionally conserved eukaryotic NHEJ factors with DNA by electron microscopy. As expected, the ring-shaped Ku complex bound stably and specifically to DNA ends at physiological salt concentrations. At a ratio of 1 Ku molecule per DNA end, the majority of DNA ends were occupied by a single Ku complex with no significant formation of linear DNA multimers or circular loops. Both Dnl4/Lif1 and DNA ligase IV/XRCC4 formed complexes with Ku-bound DNA ends, resulting in intra- and intermolecular DNA end bridging, even with non-ligatable DNA ends. Together, these studies, which provide the first visualization of the conserved complex formed by Ku and DNA ligase IV at juxtaposed DNA ends by electron microscopy, suggest that the DNA ligase IV complex mediates end-bridging by engaging two Ku-bound DNA ends.",

In eukaryotes, the nuclear single-strand DNA binding protein RPA is essential for chromosomal DNA replication and transcription and directly participates in several DNA repair processes by binding to and modulating the activity of repair factors. Much less is known about the involvement of the only mitochondrial single-strand binding protein mtSSB in the context of DNA repair. Here we demonstrate that mtSSB impedes excision of uracil and oxidative demethylation of 3meC in single-stranded DNA by UNG1 and ABH1, respectively, whereas excision by NEIL1 was partially inhibited. mtSSB also effectively inhibited nicking of single-stranded DNA by APE1 and ABH1 and partially inhibited the lyase activity of NEIL1. Finally we identified a putative surface motif in mtSSB that may recruit UNG1 to DNA-bound mtSSB. We suggest that the massive amount of mtSSB in mitochondria effectively prevents processing of uracil and other types of damaged bases to avoid introduction of nicks in single-stranded mtDNA formed during replication. Local enrichment of UNG1 at DNA-bound mtSSB may furthermore facilitate rapid access to- and processing of the damage once the dsDNA conformation is restored. This could be of potential biological importance, since mitochondria have no or limited capacity for homologous recombination to process nicks at the replication fork.",

In studies using 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labeled DNAs, AGT reduced the fluorescence intensity by \u223c40% at binding saturation, whether the FAM was located at the 5\u2032 or the 3\u2032 end of the DNA. AGT protected residual fluorescence from quenching, indicating a solute-inaccessible binding site for FAM. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses showed that saturating AGT-stoichiometries were higher with FAM-labeled DNAs than with unlabeled DNAs, suggesting that the FAM provides a protein binding site that is not present in unlabeled DNAs. Additional fluorescence and sedimentation measurements showed that AGT forms a 1:1 complex with free FAM. Active site benzylation experiments and docking calculations support models in which the primary binding site is located in or near the active site of the enzyme.

Current evidence suggests that the FA pathway initiates with DNA damage recognition by the FANCM complex (FANCM/FAAP24/MHF). However, genetic inactivation of FANCM in mouse and DT40 cells causes only a partial defect in the FA pathway activation, suggesting the existence of redundant DNA damage sensors. Here we show that the MutS homologs function in this capacity. A RNAi screen revealed that MSH2 silencing caused defective FA pathway activation, as assessed by damage-induced FANCD2 mono-ubiquitination. A similar FA pathway defect was observed with MSH3 or MSH6 silencing. MSH2 depletion caused cellular phenotypes associated with defective FA pathway, including mitomycin C hypersensitivity and chromosomal instability. Further, silencing of FANCM in MSH2 deficient HEC59 cells caused a more severe FA defect relative to comparable silencing in MSH2 complemented HEC59\u00a0+\u00a0Chr2 cells, suggesting redundant functions between MSH2 and FANCM. Consistent with this hypothesis, depletion of MSH2 resulted in defective chromatin localization of the FA core complex upon DNA damage. Further, MSH2 was co-purified and co-immunoprecipitated with FA core complex components. Taken together, our results suggest that human MutS homologs and FANCM complexes function as redundant DNA damage sensors of the FA pathway.",

Although a number of genes have been implicated in the recovery process, it is still unknown whether checkpoint recovery is caused by a signalling network activated by DNA repair or whether it is the result of the loss of DNA structures that elicit the checkpoint. Here we show that checkpoint recovery can be uncoupled from bulk chromosome DNA repair if single-stranded (ss) DNA persists. This situation occurs in cells that are deficient in the Srs2 helicase, a protein that antagonizes Rad51. We report that srs2\u0394 cells fail to eliminate Ddc2 and RPA subnuclear foci following bulk chromosome repair due to the persistence of ssDNA. In contrast to cells with DNA double-strand breaks that remain unrepaired, srs2\u0394 cells remove the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp from chromatin after repair. However, despite the loss of the 9-1-1 clamp, Dpb11 remains associated with chromatin to promote checkpoint activity. Our work indicates that Srs2 promotes checkpoint recovery by removing Rad51 after DNA repair. A failure to remove Rad51 causes persistence of ssDNA and the checkpoint signal. Therefore, we conclude that cells initiate recovery when the DNA structures that elicit the checkpoint are eliminated.",

Here, we investigated the in vivo role of DdrB, a radiation-induced Deinococcus specific protein that was previously shown to exhibit some in vitro properties akin to those of SSB protein from Escherichia coli but also to promote annealing of single stranded DNA. First we report that the deletion of the C-terminal motif of the DdrB protein, which is similar to the SSB C-terminal motif involved in recruitment to DNA of repair proteins, did neither affect cell radioresistance nor DNA binding properties of purified DdrB protein. We show that, in spite of their different quaternary structure, DdrB and SSB occlude the same amount of ssDNA in vitro. We also show that DdrB is recruited early and transiently after irradiation into the nucleoid to form discrete foci. Absence of DdrB increased the lag phase of the extended synthesis-dependent strand annealing (ESDSA) process, affecting neither the rate of DNA synthesis nor the efficiency of fragment reassembly, as indicated by monitoring DNA synthesis and genome reconstitution in cells exposed to a sub-lethal ionizing radiation dose. Moreover, cells devoid of DdrB were affected in the establishment of plasmid DNA during natural transformation, a process that requires pairing of internalized plasmid single stranded DNA fragments, whereas they were proficient in transformation by a chromosomal DNA marker that integrates into the host chromosome through homologous recombination. Our data are consistent with a model in which DdrB participates in an early step of DNA double strand break repair in cells exposed to very high radiation doses. DdrB might facilitate the accurate assembly of the myriad of small fragments generated by extreme radiation exposure through a single strand annealing (SSA) process to generate suitable substrates for subsequent ESDSA-promoted genome reconstitution.",

Following break recognition, alignment and processing, broken DNA ends are finally rejoined by the essential DNA Ligase IV. In the cell, Ligase IV is unable to function without its constitutive interaction partner XRCC4 and becomes unstable when it is missing, and it has been assumed that XRCC4 may also be required for recruitment of Ligase IV to repair sites. To investigate the function of complex formation between both proteins directly in the living cell, we stably expressed them as bio-fluorescent fusion proteins in human HT-1080 cell clones. Ligase IV or XRCC4 were expressed either alone or both were co-expressed at a roughly equimolar ratio. Labelled proteins were overexpressed manifold in comparison to endogenously expressed proteins. We show that over-expressed Ligase IV was only partially imported into the nucleus and showed a diffuse distribution there, whereas XRCC4 expressed alone was entirely nuclear with a distinct exclusion from nucleoli. When Ligase IV was co-expressed with XRCC4, both proteins formed the natural complex, and Ligase IV was not only efficiently imported but also resembled the sub-nuclear distribution of XRCC4. In addition, Ligase IV, when in complex with XRCC4, acquired a delayed nuclear reimport after mitotic cell division of XRCC4. We further determined by photobleaching the kinetics with which the proteins exchange at UVA laser-irradiated nuclear sites between damage-bound and diffusing states. We found that the dynamic exchange rate of the Ligase IV/XRCC4 complex at micro-irradiated sites was faster than that of XRCC4 expressed alone. In summary, our findings demonstrate a novel function of XRCC4 in controlling nuclear import and sub-nuclear distribution of Ligase IV, and they suggest that XRCC4 modulates the dynamic interaction of the Ligase IV/XRCC4 complex with the NHEJ machinery at double-stranded DNA breaks.",

We found that siz1\u0394 siz2\u0394 mutants are sensitive to ultra-violet (UV) light. Epistasis analysis showed that the SIZ genes act in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, and suggested that they participate both in global genome repair (GGR) and in the Rpb9-dependent subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR), but have minimal role in Rad26-dependent TCR. Quantitative analysis of NER at the single-nucleotide level showed that siz1\u0394 siz2\u0394 is deficient in repair of both the transcribed and non-transcribed strands of the DNA. These experiments confirmed that the SIZ genes participate in GGR. Their role in TCR remains unclear. It has been reported previously that mutants deficient for the SUMO conjugating enzyme Ubc9 contain reduced levels of Rad4, the yeast homolog of human XPC. However, our experiments do not support the conclusion that SUMO conjugation affects Rad4 levels. We found that several factors that participate in NER are sumoylated, including Rad4, Rad16, Rad7, Rad1, Rad10, Ssl2, Rad3, and Rpb4. Although Rad16 was heavily sumoylated, elimination of the major SUMO attachment sites in Rad16 had no detectable effect on UV resistance or removal of DNA lesions. SUMO attachment to most of these NER factors was significantly increased by DNA damage. Furthermore, SUMO-modified Rad4 accumulated in NER mutants that block the pathway downstream of Rad4, suggesting that SUMO becomes attached to Rad4 at a specific point during its functional cycle. Collectively, these results suggest that SIZ-dependent sumoylation may modulate the activity of multiple proteins to promote efficient NER.",

     "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a heritable disease characterized by bone marrow failure, congenital abnormalities, and cancer predisposition. The 15 identified FA genes operate in a molecular pathway to preserve genomic integrity. Within this pathway the FA core complex operates as an ubiquitin ligase that activates the complex of FANCD2 and FANCI to coordinate DNA repair. The FA core complex is formed by at least 12 proteins. However, only the FANCL subunit displays ubiquitin ligase activity. FANCA and FANCG are members of the FA core complex for which no other functions have been described than to participate in protein interactions. In this study we generated mice with combined null alleles for Fanca and Fancg to identify extended functions for these genes by characterizing the double mutant mice and cells.Double mutant a\u2212/\u2212/g\u2212/\u2212 mice were born at near Mendelian frequencies without apparent developmental abnormalities.

Although Rev1 was originally characterized biochemically as a dCMP transferase during AP-site bypass, the relevance of this activity in vivo is unclear. The current study uses highly sensitive frameshift- and nonsense-reversion assays to monitor the bypass of AP sites created when uracil is excised from chromosomal DNA. In the frameshift-reversion assay, an unselected base substitution frequently accompanies the selected mutation, allowing the relative incorporation of each of the four dNMPs opposite endogenously created AP sites to be inferred. Results with this assay suggest that dCMP is the most frequent dNMP inserted opposite uracil-derived AP sites and demonstrate that dCMP insertion absolutely requires the catalytic activity of Rev1. In the complementary nonsense-reversion assay, dCMP insertion likewise depended on the dCMP transferase activity of Rev1. Because dAMP insertion opposite uracil-derived AP sites does not revert the nonsense allele and hence could not be detected, it also was possible to detect low levels of dGMP or dTMP insertion upon loss of Rev1 catalytic activity. These results demonstrate that the catalytic activity of Rev1 is biologically relevant and is required specifically for dCMP insertion during the bypass of endogenous AP sites.",

Although ssDNA downstream of blocks was likely cleaved into DSBs throughout S phase, death pathways appeared to initiate late in S. In atm mutants death appeared much later, likely signaled by a slow ATR-dependent pathway. To bypass replication blocks, tissues may use TLS rather than error-free pathways that could generate genomic aberrations.

     "abstract": "Inflammation associated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONs), including peroxynitrite (ONOO\u2212) and nitric oxide (NO), create base lesions that potentially play a role in the toxicity and large genomic rearrangements associated with many malignancies. Little is known about the role of base excision repair (BER) in removing these endogenous DNA lesions. Here, we explore the role of X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) in attenuating RONs-induced genotoxicity. XRCC1 is a scaffold protein critical for BER for which polymorphisms modulate the risk of cancer. We exploited CHO and human glioblastoma cell lines engineered to express varied levels of BER proteins to study XRCC1. Cytotoxicity and the levels of DNA repair intermediates (single-strand breaks; SSB) were evaluated following exposure of the cells to the ONOO\u2212 donor, SIN-1, and to gaseous NO. XRCC1 null cells were slightly more sensitive to SIN-1 than wild-type cells. We used small-scale bioreactors to expose cells to NO and found that XRCC1-deficient CHO cells were not sensitive. However, using a molecular beacon assay to test lesion removal in vitro, we found that XRCC1 facilitates AAG-initiated excision of two key NO-induced DNA lesions: 1,N6-ethenoadenine and hypoxanthine. Furthermore, overexpression of AAG rendered XRCC1-deficient cells sensitive to NO-induced DNA damage. These results show that AAG is a key glycosylase for BER of NO-induced DNA damage and that XRCC1's role in modulating sensitivity to RONs is dependent upon the cellular level of AAG. This demonstrates the importance of considering the expression of other components of the BER pathway when evaluating the impact of XRCC1 polymorphisms on cancer risk.",

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor whose function is critical for maintaining genomic stability in mammalian cells. In response to DNA damage, p53 initiates a signaling cascade that results in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or, if the damage is severe, programmed cell death. In addition, p53 interacts with repair proteins involved in homologous recombination. Mitotic homologous recombination (HR) plays an essential role in the repair of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and broken replication forks. Loss of function of either p53 or HR leads to an increased risk of cancer. Given the importance of both p53 and HR in maintaining genomic integrity, we analyzed the effect of p53 on HR in vivo using Fluorescent Yellow Direct Repeat (FYDR) mice as well as with the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay. FYDR mice carry a direct repeat substrate in which an HR event can yield a fluorescent phenotype. Here, we show that p53 status does not significantly affect spontaneous HR in adult pancreatic cells in vivo or in primary fibroblasts in vitro when assessed using the FYDR substrate and SCEs. In addition, primary fibroblasts from p53 null mice do not show increased susceptibility to DNA damage-induced HR when challenged with mitomycin C. Taken together, the FYDR assay and SCE analysis indicate that, for some tissues and cell types, p53 status does not greatly impact HR.",

     "abstract": "In the early steps of homologous recombination, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) from a broken chromosome invades homologous sequence located in a sister or homolog donor. In genomes that contain numerous repetitive DNA elements or gene paralogs, recombination can potentially occur between non-allelic/divergent (homeologous) sequences that share sequence identity. Such recombination events can lead to lethal chromosomal deletions or rearrangements. However, homeologous recombination events can be suppressed through rejection mechanisms that involve recognition of DNA mismatches in heteroduplex DNA by mismatch repair factors, followed by active unwinding of the heteroduplex DNA by helicases. Because factors required for heteroduplex rejection are hypothesized to be targets and/or effectors of the DNA damage response (DDR), a cell cycle control mechanism that ensures timely and efficient repair, we tested whether the DDR, and more specifically, the RAD9 gene, had a role in regulating rejection. We performed these studies using a DNA repair assay that measures repair by single-strand annealing (SSA) of a double-strand break (DSB) using homeologous DNA templates. We found that repair of homeologous DNA sequences, but not identical sequences, induced a RAD9-dependent cell cycle delay in the G2 stage of the cell cycle. Repair through a divergent DNA template occurred more frequently in RAD9 compared to rad9\u0394 strains. However, repair in rad9\u0394 mutants could be restored to wild-type levels if a G2 delay was induced by nocodazole. These results suggest that cell cycle arrest induced by the Rad9-dependent DDR allows repair between divergent DNA sequences despite the potential for creating deleterious genome rearrangements, and illustrates the importance of additional cellular mechanisms that act to suppress recombination between divergent DNA sequences.",

     "abstract": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced DNA lesions can be efficiently repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER). However, NER is less effective during replication of UV-damaged chromosomes. In contrast, translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and homologous recombination (HR) are capable of dealing with lesions in replicating DNA. The core HR protein in mammalian cells is the strand exchange protein RAD51, which is aided by numerous proteins, including RAD54. We used RAD54 as a cellular marker for HR to study the response of mammalian embryonic stem (ES) cells to UV irradiation. In contrast to yeast, ES cells lacking RAD54 are not UV sensitive. Here we show that the requirement for mammalian RAD54 is masked by active NER. By genetically inactivating NER and HR through disruption of the Xpa and Rad54 genes, respectively, we demonstrate the contribution of HR to chromosomal integrity upon UV irradiation. We demonstrate using chromosome fiber analysis at the individual replication fork level, that HR activity is important for the restart of DNA replication after induction of DNA damage by UV-light in NER-deficient cells. Furthermore, our data reveal RAD54-dependent and -independent contributions of HR to the cellular sensitivity to UV-light, and they uncover that RAD54 can compensate for the loss of TLS polymerase \u03b7 with regard to UV-light sensitivity. In conclusion, we show that HR is important for the progression of UV-stalled replication forks in ES cells, and that protection of the fork is an interplay between HR and TLS.",

     "abstract": "Carcinogenesis may involve overproduction of oxygen-derived species including free radicals, which are capable of damaging DNA and other biomolecules in vivo. Increased DNA damage contributes to genetic instability and promote the development of malignancy. We hypothesized that the repair of oxidatively induced DNA base damage may be modulated in colorectal malignant tumors, resulting in lower levels of DNA base lesions than in surrounding pathologically normal tissues. To test this hypothesis, we investigated oxidatively induced DNA damage in cancerous tissues and their surrounding normal tissues of patients with colorectal cancer. The levels of oxidatively induced DNA lesions such as 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine, 8-hydroxyguanine and (5\u2032S)-8,5\u2032-cyclo-2\u2032-deoxyadenosine were measured by gas chromatography/isotope-dilution mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography/isotope-dilution tandem mass spectrometry. We found that the levels of these DNA lesions were significantly lower in cancerous colorectal tissues than those in surrounding non-cancerous tissues. In addition, the level of DNA lesions varied between colon and rectum tissues, being lower in the former than in the latter. The results strongly suggest upregulation of DNA repair in malignant colorectal tumors that may contribute to the resistance to therapeutic agents affecting the disease outcome and patient survival. The type of DNA base lesions identified in this work suggests the upregulation of both base excision and nucleotide excision pathways. Development of DNA repair inhibitors targeting both repair pathways may be considered for selective killing of malignant tumors in colorectal cancer.",

In bacteria, extensive studies have been conducted with the MutH-dependent MMR in Escherichia coli and its close relatives. The picture of MutH-independent MMR in other bacteria is less clear, as MMR components other than MutS and MutL have not been identified in the majority of bacteria. Bacillus anthracis is one of the MutH-less Gram+ bacteria in the phylum of Firmicutes. We used papillation as a tool to search for B. anthracis new mutator strains and identified a spontaneous mutator that carries a minitransposon insertion in the BAS4289 locus. The mutational frequency and specificity exhibited in this mutant were comparable to that of MMR-deficient strains with knockouts of mutL or mutS. It retained a similar UV sensitivity profile as that of the wild type. BAS4289 encodes a putative DNA helicase RecD2 that shares 30% sequence identity with Deinococcus radiodurans RecD2, a well characterized superfamily 1B helicase whose homologs are widely present in Firmicutes complete genomes. We demonstrated that the N-terminal region of RecD2, a unique sequence extension used to distinguish RecD2 from RecD1, was important for B. anthracis RecD2, as mutations in the N-terminal conserved motifs affected its DNA repair function. This is the first report of a RecD2 helicase being associated with MMR. RecD2 and our recently described YycJ protein are likely to be two additional components in the B. anthracis MutH-independent MMR system.",

To gain a better understanding of this molecular alteration, we developed a long-distance inverse PCR (LDI PCR) method for M-bcr breakpoint identification in BCR-ABL1-positive cases and were thus able to identify the chromosomal breakpoints within the M-bcr in 62 BCR-ABL1-positive samples. The corresponding reciprocal breakpoints were identified and molecularly characterized in 45 of these cases. In 2 samples, the breaks were located 5\u2032 to the ABL1 locus and in one case, the der(9) break was identified on 9q34.13 several hundred kB 3\u2032 telomeric to ABL1. The analysis of breaks revealed no significant clustering and no association with repetitive elements (Alu, L1, L2) or recombination signal sequence sites. The established LDI PCR permits fast, relatively easy and unbiased identification of breakpoints in the M-bcr region of BCR and also enables the molecular analysis of more complex translocations with breakpoints outside the ABL1 gene locus or other BCR fusion genes.",

We found that yeast Rev1 is capable of rapid nucleotide incorporation, but only a small fraction of the protein molecules possessed this robust activity.

Utilizing a fractionation-based approach, we have isolated a single polypeptide that enhances mismatch dependence of reconstituted 5\u2032-directed excision and have shown it to be identical to poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1). Titration of reconstituted excision reactions or PARP-1-depleted HeLa nuclear extract with purified PARP-1 showed that the protein specifically enhances mismatch dependence of 5\u2032-directed excision. Analysis of a set of PARP-1 mutants revealed that the DNA binding domain and BRCT fold contribute to the regulation of excision specificity. Involvement of the catalytic domain is restricted to its ability to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ate PARP-1 in the presence of NAD+, likely through interference with DNA binding. Analysis of protein-protein interactions demonstrated that PARP-1 interacts with mismatch repair proteins MutS\u03b1, exonuclease 1, replication protein A (RPA), and as previously shown by others, replication factor C (RFC) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) as well.

However, telomerase can also add telomeric repeat sequences at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), a process called chromosome healing. Here, we employed a method of inducing DSBs near telomeres to query the role of two proteins, PIF1 and NBS1, in chromosome healing in mammalian cells. PIF1 was investigated because the PIF1 homolog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae inhibits chromosome healing, as shown by a 1000-fold increase in chromosome in PIF1-deficient cells. NBS1 was investigated because the functional homolog of NBS1 in S. cerevisiae, Xrs2, is part of the Mre11/Rad50/Xrs2 complex that is required for chromosome healing due to its role in the processing of DSBs and recruitment of telomerase. We found that disruption of mPif1 had no detectable effect on the frequency of chromosome healing at DSBs near telomeres in murine embryonic stem cells. Moreover, the Nbs1\u0394B hypomorph, which is defective in the processing of DSBs, also had no detectable effect on the frequency of chromosome healing, DNA degradation, or gross chromosome rearrangements (GCRs) that result from telomeric DSBs. Although we cannot rule out small changes in chromosome healing using this system, it is clear from our results that knockout of PIF1 or the Nbs1\u0394B hypomorph does not result in large differences in chromosome healing in murine cells. These results represent the first genetic assessment of the role of these proteins in chromosome healing in mammals, and suggest that murine cells have evolved mechanisms to ensure the functional redundancy of Pif1 or Nbs1 in the regulation of chromosome healing.",

The mitotic arrest was caffeine sensitive and UCN01 insensitive and did not absolutely require p53, ATM or Chk1, while p21 was necessary for maintaining the growth arrest.

Comparisons of these models with biochemical nicking data revealed significant changes in the damage search mechanisms between wild-type pdgs and most of the mutant enzymes. Several conserved arginine residues were shown to be critical for the processivity of the incision activity, without interfering with catalysis at AP sites.

     "abstract": "The transposases of DNA transposable elements catalyze the excision of the element from the host genome, but are not involved in the repair of the resulting double-strand break. To elucidate the role of various host DNA repair and damage response proteins in the repair of the hairpin-ended double strand breaks (DSBs) generated during excision of the maize Ac element in Arabidopsis thaliana, we deep-sequenced hundreds of thousands of somatic excision products from a variety of repair- or response-defective mutants. We find that each of these repair/response defects negatively affects the preservation of the ends, resulting in an enhanced frequency of deletions, insertions, and inversions at the excision site. The spectra of the resulting repair products demonstrate, not unexpectedly, that the canonical nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) proteins DNA ligase IV and KU70 play an important role in the repair of the lesion generated by Ac excision. Our data also indicate that auxiliary NHEJ repair proteins such as DNA ligase VI and DNA polymerase lambda are routinely involved in the repair of these lesions. Roles for the damage response kinases ATM and ATR in the repair of transposition-induced DSBs are also discussed.",

Moreover, Mph1 unwinds 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 DNA Flap structures that bear key features of the D-loop.

By comparing the mutation spectra in B cells of WT, TLS polymerase \u03b7 (Pol\u03b7)-deficient, PCNAK164R-mutant, and PCNAK164R;Pol\u03b7 double-mutant mice, we now find that most PCNA-Ub-independent A/T mutagenesis during SHM is mediated by Pol\u03b7.

Interestingly, compared to the single mutants, PCNAK164R;Pol\u03b7 double-mutant cells are dramatically delayed in S phase progression and far more prone to cell death following UV exposure.

Uniquely amongst the Y family polymerases, the N-terminal part of Rev1, dubbed the BR CA1 C - t erminal homology (BRCT) region, includes a BRCT domain. While most BRCT domains mediate protein\u2013protein interactions, Rev1 contains a predicted \u03b1-helix N-terminal to the BRCT domain and in human Replication Factor C (RFC) such a BRCT region endows the protein with DNA binding capacity. Here, we studied the DNA binding properties of yeast and mouse Rev1. Our results show that the BRCT region of Rev1 specifically binds to a 5\u2032 phosphorylated, recessed, primer\u2013template junction. This DNA binding depends on the extra \u03b1-helix, N-terminal to the BRCT domain. Surprisingly, a stretch of 20 amino acids N-terminal to the predicted \u03b1-helix is also critical for high-affinity DNA binding. In addition to 5\u2032 primer\u2013template junction binding, Rev1 efficiently binds to a recessed 3\u2032 primer\u2013template junction.

We found that XRCC1 is a direct regulatory target of E2F1 and further investigated the role of XRCC1 in DNA repair during the cell cycle. Saos2 primary osteosarcoma cells stably transfected with inducible E2F1-wt or mutant E2F1-132E were treated with hydroxurea (HU) for 36\u00a0h and were subsequently withdrawn HU for 2\u201324\u00a0h to test whether cell-cycle-dependent DNA SSBR requires E2F1-mediated upregulation of XRCC1. We found that SSBR activity, as determined using a qPCR-base method, was correlated with E2F1 levels at different phases of the cell cycle. XRCC1-positive (AA8) and negative (EM9) CHO cells were used to demonstrate that the alterations in SSBR were mediated by XRCC1. The results indicate that E2F1-mediated regulation of XRCC1 is required for cell-cycle-dependent SSBR predominantly in G1/S phases. Our observations have provided new mechanistic insight for understanding the role of E2F1 in the maintenance of genomic stability and cell survival during the cell cycle. The regulation of XRCC1 by E2F1 during cell-cycle-dependent SSBR might be an important aspect for practical consideration for resolving the problem of drug resistance in tumor chemotherapies.",

Three genes (ada, alkA, and alkB) encode DNA repair proteins that remove or repair alkylated bases. However, the role of AidB remains unclear despite extensive efforts to determine its function in cells exposed to alkylating agents. The E. coli AidB protein was identified as a component of the protein complex that assembles at strong promoters. We demonstrate that AidB protein preferentially binds to UP elements, AT rich transcription enhancer sequences found upstream of many highly expressed genes, several DNA repair genes, and housekeeping genes. AidB allows efficient transcription from promoters containing an UP element upon exposure to a DNA methylating agent and protects downstream genes from DNA damage. The DNA binding domain is required to target AidB to specific genes preferentially protecting them from alkylation damage. However, deletion of AidB's DNA binding domain does not prevent its antimutagenic activity, instead this deletion appears to allow AidB to function as a cytoplasmic alkylation resistance protein. Our studies identify the role of AidB in alkylating agent exposed cells and suggest a new cellular strategy in which a subset of the genome is preferentially protected from damage by alkylating agents.",

     "abstract": "Although exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) can produce significant neurotoxicity, the mechanisms mediating this toxicity remain to be determined. Previous studies using neurons isolated from the central nervous system show that IR produces reactive oxygen species and oxidative DNA damage in those cells. Because the base excision DNA repair pathway repairs single-base modifications caused by ROS, we asked whether manipulating this pathway by altering APE1 expression would affect radiation-induced neurotoxicity. In cultures of adult hippocampal and sensory neurons, IR produces DNA damage as measured by phosphorylation of histone H2A.X and results in dose-dependent cell death. In isolated sensory neurons, we demonstrate for the first time that radiation decreases the capsaicin-evoked release of the neuropeptide CGRP. Reducing APE1 expression in cultured cells augments IR-induced neurotoxicity, whereas overexpressing APE1 is neuroprotective. Using lentiviral constructs with a neuronal specific promoter that selectively expresses APE1s different functions in neurons, we show that selective expression of the DNA repair competent (redox inactive) APE1 constructs in sensory neurons resurrects cell survival and neuronal function, whereas use of DNA-repair deficient (redox active) constructs is not protective. Use of an APE1 redox-specific inhibitor, APX3330, also facilitates neuronal protection against IR-induced toxicity. These results demonstrate for the first time that the repair function of APE1 is required to protect both hippocampal and DRG neuronal cultures\u2014specifically neuronal cells\u2014from IR-induced damage, while the redox activity of APE1 does not appear to be involved.",

     "abstract": "Non-B DNA structures are a major contributor to the genomic instability associated with repetitive sequences. Immunoglobulin switch Mu (S\u03bc) region sequence is comprised of guanine-rich repeats and has high potential for forming G4 DNA, in which one strand of DNA folds into an array of guanine quartets. Taking advantage of the genetic tractability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we developed a recombination assay to investigate mechanisms involved in maintaining stability of G-rich repetitive sequence. By embedding S\u03bc sequence within recombination substrates under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable promoter, we demonstrate that the rate and orientation of transcription both affect the stability of S\u03bc sequence. In particular, the greatest instability was observed under high-transcription conditions when the S\u03bc sequence was oriented with the C-rich strand as the transcription template. The effect of transcription orientation was enhanced in the absence of the Type IB topoisomerase Top1, possibly due to enhanced R-loop formation. Loss of Sgs1 helicase and RNase H activity also increased instability, suggesting they may cooperatively function to reduce the formation of non-B DNA structures in highly transcribed regions. Finally, the S\u03bc sequence was unstable when transcription elongation was perturbed due to a defective THO complex. In a THO-deficient background, there was further exacerbation of orientation-dependent instability associated with the ectopically expressed, single-strand cytosine deaminase AID. The implications of our findings to understanding instability associated with potential G4 DNA forming sequences are discussed.",

We also show that XRCC1ckm protein has a higher affinity for DNA than wild type XRCC1 protein and resides in an immobile fraction on DNA, in particular after damage. We propose a model whereby the increased affinity for DNA sequesters XRCC1ckm and the repair enzymes associated with it, at the repair site, which retards kinetics of BER. In conclusion, our results indicate that phosphorylation of XRCC1 by CK2 facilitates the BER incision step, likely by promoting dissociation from DNA.",

The dynamics of \u03b3-H2AX foci disappearance in the presence and in the absence of butyrate, however, demonstrated that butyrate inhibited DSB repair. In an attempt to clarify which one of the two major DSBs repair pathways was affected, we synchronized HeLa cells in G1 phase and after \u03b3-irradiation followed the repair of the DSBs by agarose gel electrophoresis. Since HR is not operational during G1 phase, by this approach we determined the rates of NHEJ only. The results showed that NHEJ decreased in the presence of butyrate. In another set of experiments, we followed the dynamics of disappearance of RAD51 foci in the presence and in the absence of butyrate after \u03b3-radiation of HeLa cells. Since RAD51 takes part in HR only, this experiment allows the effect of butyrate on DSB repair by homologous recombination to be assessed. It showed that HR was also obstructed by butyrate. These results were confirmed by host cell reactivation assays in which the repair of plasmids containing a single DSB by NHEJ or HR was monitored. We suggest that after a DSB is formed, HDACs deacetylated core histones in the vicinity of the breaks in order to compact the chromatin structure and prevent the broken DNA ends from moving apart from each other, thus ensuring effective repair.",

ERCC1 deficient mice show severe growth retardation associated with premature replicative senescence leading to liver failure and death at four weeks of age. In humans, ERCC1 is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma and in the late G1 phase of hepatocyte cell cycle.To investigate whether ERCC1 could be involved in human hepatocyte cell growth and cell cycle progression, we knocked-down ERCC1 expression in the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7 by RNA interference. ERCC1 knocked-down cells were delayed in their cell cycle and became multinucleated. This phenotype was rescued by ERCC1 overexpression. Multinucleation was not liver specific since it also occurred in HeLa and in human fibroblasts knocked-down for ERCC1. Multinucleated cells arose after drastic defects leading to flawed metaphase and cytokinesis. Interestingly, multinucleation did not appear after knocking-down other NER enzymes such as XPC and XPF, suggesting that NER deficiency was not responsible for multinucleation. Moreover, XPF mutant human fibroblasts formed multinucleated cells after ERCC1 knock-down but not after XPF knock-down. Therefore our results seem consistent with ERCC1 being involved in multinucleation but not XPF.This work reveals a new role for ERCC1 distinct from its known function in DNA repair, which may be independent of XPF.

Two of the crosslinked proteins were identified as the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase \u025b and Ddc1 checkpoint protein. Labeling of DNA polymerase \u025b catalytic subunit with the nick-containing DNA repair intermediate indicates that the DNA polymerase is involved in the DNA repair synthesis in yeast, at least at DNA single-strand interruptions. Crosslinking of Ddc1 to DNA nicks took place independently of the other components of checkpoint clamp, Mec3 and Rad17, suggesting that the protein alone is able to recognize DNA single-strand breaks. Indeed, purified GST-tagged Ddc1 protein was efficiently crosslinked to nick-containing DNA. The interaction of Ddc1 with DNA nicks may provide a link between the DNA damage checkpoint and DNA base excision/single-strand breaks repair pathways in yeast. In addition, we found that absence of Ddc1 protein greatly influences the overall pattern of other proteins crosslinked to DNA nick. We suggested that this last effect of Ddc1 is at least partially due to its capacity to prevent proteolytic degradation of the DNA\u2013protein adducts.",

Previous studies have led to the suggestion that the primary role of Pol \u03b6 in TLS is to extend primers created when another DNA polymerase inserts nucleotides opposite lesions. Here we test the non-exclusive possibility that Pol \u03b6 can sometimes perform TLS in the absence of any other polymerase. To do so, we quantified the efficiency with which S. cerevisiae Pol \u03b6 bypasses abasic sites, cis-syn cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (6-4) photoproducts. In reactions containing dNTP concentrations that mimic those induced by DNA damage, a Pol \u03b6 derivative with phenylalanine substituted for leucine 979 at the polymerase active site bypasses all three lesions at efficiencies between 27 and 73%. Wild-type Pol \u03b6 also bypasses these lesions, with efficiencies that are lower and depend on the sequence context in which the lesion resides. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that, in addition to extending aberrant termini created by other DNA polymerases, Pol \u03b6 has the potential to be the sole DNA polymerase involved in TLS.",

     "abstract": "Several genes in human cells are activated by physical genotoxic agents in order to regenerate cell homeostasis. Among the pathways contributing to this response, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is unique in restoring the nucleotide sequence of the DNA molecule without generating mutations. The first step of NER is mediated by a protein complex composed of XPC, RAD23B, an ubiquitin receptor and CENTRIN 2, an EF-hand calcium binding protein. These three proteins are multifunctional and participate in other important biochemical pathways. We silenced the XPC, RAD23A or RAD23B genes in HeLa cells for a long period of time by using Epstein Barr Virus-derived plasmids carrying sequences coding for small interfering RNA. XPC silencing confirms an essential role for XPC in DNA repair and cell survival after ultraviolet light irradiation. RAD23A and RAD23B participate in DNA repair and cell survival with diverging functions. Our data also indicate that CENTRIN 2 is recruited onto nuclear damaged areas quickly after irradiation and that XPC plays an important role during its internalization into the nucleus of human cells. Furthermore, the inhibition of XPC expression correlates with a decreased amount of CENTRIN 2 transcript and protein, indicating that XPC is required for the fine tuning of CENTRIN 2 gene expression. Moreover, XPC-silenced cells present a reduced concentration of CENTRIN 2 that affects both its centrosomal and nuclear localization suggesting that XPC deficiency may indirectly slow down cell division.",

The rare autosomal recessive disorder Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia secondary to Purkinje cell death, immunodeficiency, and increased cancer incidence. ATM, the protein mutated in A-T, plays a key role in cellular DNA-damage responses. A-T cells show poor cellular anti-oxidant defences and increased oxidant sensitivity compared to normal cells, and ATM functions, in part, as an oxidative stress sensor. The oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and its uptake by macrophages is an initiating step in the development of atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that oxLDL activates ATM and downstream p21 expression in normal fibroblasts and endothelial cells. In ATM-deficient fibroblasts oxLDL induces DNA double-strand breaks, micronuclei formation and causes chromosome breaks. Furthermore, oxLDL decreases cell viability and inhibits colony formation in A-T fibroblasts more effectively as compared to normal controls. Formation of oxLDL-induced reactive oxygen species is significantly higher in A-T, than normal fibroblasts. Last, pre-treatment of cells with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, a potent antioxidant and inhibitor of transcription factor nuclear factor \u03baB, reduces oxLDL-induced reactive oxygen species formation.

Due to 3-mA chemical instability, the stable isostere 3-methyl-3-deazaadenine (3-m-c3A) was site specifically positioned into an oligodeoxynucleotide. The oligomer was, then incorporated into a vector system that is rapidly converted to ssDNA inside yeast cells and requires DNA replication opposite the lesion for plasmid clonal selection. For control purposes, an adenine or a stable apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP)-lesion was placed at the same site. The presence of each lesion in the oligonucleotide was confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis. Plasmids were then transfected into yeast cells. While the AP-site dramatically reduced plasmid replication in all strains, the 3-m-c3A had a slight effect in the rad30 background which significantly increased only in a rev3rad30 background. Considering TLS events opposite 3-m-c3A, the lack of Pol\u03b7 was associated with a substantial increase in AT\u00a0>\u00a0GC transitions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0011), while in the absence of Pol\u03b6 only events derived from an error free bypass were detected. The 3-m-c3A also did not affect in vitro transcription, while the AP-site was a strong block to T7 RNA progression when located in the transcribed strand. We conclude that, in these experimental systems, 3-m-c3A is efficiently bypassed by replication in vivo and by transcription in vitro.",

Their DNA contains 6-TG which absorbs ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, and their skin is UVA hypersensitive, consistent with the formation of DNA photodamage. Here we demonstrate that UVA irradiation of 6-TG-containing DNA causes DNA interstrand crosslinking. In synthetic duplex oligodeoxynucleotides, the interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) can form between closely opposed 6-TG bases and, in a less favoured reaction, between 6-TG and normal bases on the opposite strand. In vivo, UVA irradiation of cultured cells containing 6-TG-substituted DNA also causes ICL formation and induces the chromosome aberrations that are characteristically associated with this type of DNA lesion. 6-TG/UVA activates the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway via monoubiquitination of the FANCD2 protein. Cells defective in the FA pathway or other factors involved in ICL processing, such as XPF and DNA Pol\u03b6, are all hypersensitive to killing by 6-TG/UVA-consistent with a significant contribution of photochemical ICLs to the cytotoxicity of this treatment. Our findings suggest that sunlight-exposed skin of thiopurine treated patients may experience chronic photochemical DNA damage that requires constant intervention of the FA pathway.",

The 32P-postlabelling assay was applied to analyze DNA adduct levels and the Hprt gene mutation assay for monitoring mutations. Previously, we found that the mutagenicity per adduct was four times higher for DBPDE compared to BPDE in NER proficient cells. In these same cells, the mutagenicity of DBADE and BPhDE adducts was now found to be significantly lower compared to that of BPDE. In NER deficient cells the highest mutagenicity per adduct was found for BPDE and there was a tenfold and fivefold difference when comparing the BPDE data with the DBADE and BPhDE data, respectively. In order to investigate to what extent the mutagenicity of the different adducts in NER proficient cells was influenced by repair or replication bypass, we measured the overall NER incision rate, the rate of adduct removal, the rate of replication bypass and the frequency of induced recombination in the Hprt gene. Since NER turned out to be an important pathway for the yield of mutations, we further analyzed the role of transcription coupled NER versus global genome NER. However, our data demonstrate that neither of these pathways seems to be the sole factor determining the mutation frequency of the four PAH\u2013DE and that the differences in the repair efficiency of these compounds could not be related to the presence of a bay or fjord region in the parent PAH.",

     "abstract": "The repair protein 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine glycosylase (OGG1) initiates base excision repair (BER) in mammalian cells by removing the oxidized base 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) from DNA. Interestingly, OGG1 has been implicated in somatic expansion of the trinucleotide repeat (TNR) sequence CAG/CTG. Furthermore, a \u2018toxic oxidation cycle\u2019 has been proposed for age-dependent expansion in somatic cells. In this cycle, duplex TNR DNA is (1) oxidized by endogenous species; (2) BER is initiated by OGG1 and the DNA is further processed by AP endonuclease 1 (APE1); (3) a stem-loop hairpin forms during strand-displacement synthesis by polymerase \u03b2 (pol \u03b2); (4) the hairpin is ligated and (5) incorporated into duplex DNA to generate an expanded CAG/CTG region. This expanded region is again subject to oxidation and the cycle continues. We reported previously that the hairpin adopted by TNR repeats contains a hot spot for oxidation. This finding prompted us to examine the possibility that the generation of a hairpin during a BER event exacerbates the toxic oxidation cycle due to accumulation of damage. Therefore, in this work we used mixed-sequence and TNR substrates containing a site-specific 8-oxoG lesion to define the kinetic parameters of human OGG1 (hOGG1) activity on duplex and hairpin substrates. We report that hOGG1 activity on TNR duplexes is indistinguishable from a mixed-sequence control. Thus, BER is initiated on TNR sequences as readily as non-repetitive DNA in order to start the toxic oxidation cycle. However, we find that for hairpin substrates hOGG1 has reduced affinity and excises 8-oxoG at a significantly slower rate as compared to duplexes. Therefore, 8-oxoG is expected to accumulate in the hairpin intermediate. This damage-containing hairpin can then be incorporated into duplex, resulting in an expanded TNR tract that now contains an oxidative lesion. Thus, the cycle restarts and the DNA can incrementally expand.",

All three polymerases can replicate past ribonucleotides. Relative to all-DNA templates, bypass of ribo-containing templates is slightly reduced, to extents that depend on the identity of the ribo and the sequence context in which it resides.

Several of these XP proteins are characterized by a mediocre preference for damaged substrates over the native double helix but, intriguingly, none of them recognizes injured bases with sufficient selectivity to account for the very high precision of bulky lesion excision. Instead, substrate versatility as well as damage specificity and strand selectivity are achieved by a multistage quality control strategy whereby different subunits of the XP pathway, in succession, interrogate the DNA double helix for a distinct abnormality in its structural or dynamic parameters. Through this step-by-step filtering procedure, the XP proteins operate like a systematic decision making tool, generally known as decision tree analysis, to sort out rare damaged bases embedded in a vast excess of native DNA.

     "abstract": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is an important prokaryotic and eukaryotic defense mechanism that removes a large variety of structurally distinct lesions in cellular DNA. While the proteins involved are completely different, the mode of action of these two repair systems is similar, involving a cut-and-patch mechanism in which an oligonucleotide sequence containing the lesion is excised. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic NER damage-recognition factors have common structural features of \u03b2-hairpin intrusion between the two DNA strands at the site of the lesion. In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that this common \u03b2-hairpin intrusion motif is mirrored in parallel NER incision efficiencies in the two systems. We have utilized human HeLa cell extracts and the prokaryotic UvrABC proteins to determine their relative NER incision efficiencies. We report here comparisons of relative NER efficiencies with a set of stereoisomeric DNA lesions derived from metabolites of benzo[a]pyrene and equine estrogens in different sequence contexts, utilizing 21 samples. We found a general qualitative trend toward similar relative NER incision efficiencies for \u223c65% of these substrates; the other cases deviate mostly by \u223c30% or less from a perfect correlation, although several more distant outliers are also evident. This resemblance is consistent with the hypothesis that lesion recognition through \u03b2-hairpin insertion, a common feature of the two systems, is facilitated by local thermodynamic destabilization induced by the lesions in both cases. In the case of the UvrABC system, varying the nature of the UvrC endonuclease, while maintaining the same UvrA/B proteins, can markedly affect the relative incision efficiencies. These observations suggest that, in addition to recognition involving the initial modified duplexes, downstream events involving UvrC can also play a role in distinguishing and processing different lesions in prokaryotic NER.",

Biologically critical XPB and XPD helicases are key members of the human TFIIH complex; they anchor CAK kinase (cyclinH, MAT1, CDK7) to TFIIH and open DNA for transcription and for repair of duplex distorting damage by nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER is initiated by arrested RNA polymerase or damage recognition by XPC\u2013RAD23B with or without DDB1/DDB2. XP helicases, named for their role in the extreme sun-mediated skin cancer predisposition xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), are then recruited to asymmetrically unwind dsDNA flanking the damage. XPB and XPD genetic defects can also cause premature aging with profound neurological defects without increased cancers: Cockayne syndrome (CS) and trichothiodystrophy (TTD). XP helicase patient phenotypes cannot be predicted from the mutation position along the linear gene sequence and adjacent mutations can cause different diseases. Here we consider the structural biology of DNA damage recognition by XPC\u2013RAD23B, DDB1/DDB2, RNAPII, and ATL, and of helix unwinding by the XPB and XPD helicases plus the bacterial repair helicases UvrB and UvrD in complex with DNA. We then propose unified models for TFIIH assembly and roles in NER. Collective crystal structures with NMR and electron microscopy results reveal functional motifs, domains, and architectural elements that contribute to biological activities: damaged DNA binding, translocation, unwinding, and ATP driven changes plus TFIIH assembly and signaling. Coupled with mapping of patient mutations, these combined structural analyses provide a framework for integrating and unifying the rich biochemical and cellular information that has accumulated over forty years of study. This integration resolves puzzles regarding XP helicase functions and suggests that XP helicase positions and activities within TFIIH detect and verify damage, select the damaged strand for incision, and coordinate repair with transcription and cell cycle through CAK signaling.",

     "abstract": "In an earlier review of our understanding of the mechanism of nucleotide excision repair (NER) we examined the process with respect to how it occurs in chromatin [1]. We described how much of our mechanistic understanding of NER was derived from biochemical studies that analysed the repair reaction in DNA substrates not representative of that which exists in the living cell. We pointed out that our efforts to understand how NER operates in chromatin had been hampered in part because of the well-known inhibition of NER that occurs when DNA is assembled into nucleosomes and used as the substrate to examine the repair reaction in vitro. Despite this technical bottleneck, we summarized the biochemical, genetic and cell-based studies which have provided insights into the molecular mechanism of NER in the cellular context. More recently, we revisited the topic of how UV induced DNA damage is repaired in chromatin. In this review we examined the commonly held view that depicts a struggle in which the DNA repair machinery battles to overcome the inhibitory effect of chromatin during the repair process. We suggested that in this interpretation of events, the DNA repair mechanisms might be described as \u2018tilting at windmills\u2019: fighting an imaginary foe [2]. We surmised that this scenario was overly simplistic, and we described an emerging picture in which the DNA repair process and chromatin remodeling were mechanistically linked and were in fact functioning cooperatively to organize the efficient removal of DNA damage from the genome. Here we discuss the latest findings, which contribute to the idea that DNA damage induced changes to chromatin represent an important way in which the DNA repair process is initiated and organized throughout the genome to promote the efficient removal of damage in response to UV radiation.",

     "abstract": "A network of DNA damage surveillance systems is triggered by sensing of DNA lesions and the initiation of a signal transduction cascade that activates genome-protection pathways including nucleotide excision repair (NER). NER operates through coordinated assembly of repair factors into pre- and post-incision complexes. Recent work identifies RPA as a key regulator of the transition from dual incision to repair-synthesis in UV-irradiated non-cycling cells, thereby averting the generation of unprocessed repair intermediates. These intermediates could lead to recombinogenic events and trigger a persistent ATR-dependent checkpoint signaling. It is now evident that DNA damage signaling is not limited to NER proficient cells. ATR-dependent checkpoint activation also occurs in UV-exposed non-cycling repair deficient cells coinciding with the formation of endonuclease APE1-mediated DNA strand breaks. In addition, the encounter of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNAPIIo) with DNA damage lesions and its persistent stalling provides a strong DNA damage signaling leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and increased mutagenesis. The mechanism underlying the strong and strand specific induction of UV-induced mutations in NER deficient cells has been recently resolved by the finding that gene transcription itself increases UV-induced mutagenesis in a strand specific manner via increased deamination of cytosines. The cell removes the RNAPIIo-blocking DNA lesions by transcription-coupled repair (TC-NER) without displacement of the DNA damage stalled RNAPIIo. Deficiency in TC-NER associates with mutations in the CSA and CSB genes giving rise to the rare human disorder Cockayne syndrome (CS). CSB functions as a repair coupling factor to attract NER proteins, chromatin remodelers and the CSA-E3-ubiquitin ligase complex to the stalled RNAPIIo; CSA is dispensable for attraction of NER proteins, yet in cooperation with CSB is required to recruit XAB2, the nucleosomal binding protein HMGN1 and TFIIS. The molecular mechanisms by which these proteins bring about efficient TC-NER and trigger signaling after transcription arrest remain elusive; particularly the role of chromatin remodeling in TC-NER needs to be clarified in the context of anticipated structural changes that allow repair and transcription restart.",

In contrast to several other DNA damage response mechanisms that occur in specific subnuclear structures, NER is not confined to nuclear foci, which has severely hampered the analysis of its arrangement in time and space. In this review the recently developed tools to study the dynamic molecular transactions between the NER factors and the chromatin template are summarized. First, different procedures to inflict DNA damage in a part of the cell nucleus are discussed. In addition, technologies to measure protein dynamics of NER factors tagged with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) will be reviewed. Most of the dynamic parameters of GFP-tagged NER factors are deduced from different variants of \u2018fluorescence recovery after photobleaching\u2019 (FRAP) experiments and FRAP analysis procedures will be briefly evaluated. The combination of local damage induction, genetic tagging of repair factors with GFP and microscopy innovations have provided the basis for the determination of NER kinetics within living mammalian cells. These new cell biological approaches have disclosed a highly dynamic arrangement of NER factors that assemble in an orderly fashion on damaged DNA. The spatio-temporal analysis tools developed for the study of NER and the kinetic model derived from these studies can serve as a paradigm for the understanding of other chromatin-associated processes.",

In addition to cancer, recent years have also uncovered a very strong association of DNA damage with many features of (premature) aging. The notion that DNA repair systems protect not only against cancer but also equally against to fast aging has become evident from a systematic, integral analysis of a variety of mouse mutants carrying defects in e.g. transcription-coupled repair with or without an additional impairment of global genome nucleotide excision repair and the corresponding segmental premature aging syndromes in human. A striking correlation between the degree of the DNA repair deficiency and the acceleration of specific progeroid symptoms has been discovered for those repair systems that primarily protect from the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of DNA damage. These observations are explained from the perspective of nucleotide excision repair mouse mutant and human syndromes. However, similar principles likely apply to other DNA repair pathways including interstrand crosslink repair and double strand break repair and genome maintenance systems in general, supporting the notion that DNA damage constitutes an important intermediate in the process of aging.",

We previously identified a stationary phase specific increase in minisatellite instability caused by mutations in the high affinity zinc transporter ZRT1, using a minisatellite inserted into the ADE2 locus in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we examined ZRT1-mediated minisatellite instability in yeast strains lacking key recombination genes to determine the mechanisms by which these alterations occur. Our analysis revealed that minisatellite alterations in a \u0394zrt1 mutant occur by a combination of RAD52-dependent and RAD52-independent mechanisms. In this study, plasmid-based experiments demonstrate that ZRT1-mediated minisatellite alterations occur independently of chromosomal context or adenine auxotrophy, and confirmed the stationary phase timing of the events. To further examine the stationary phase specificity of ZRT1-mediated minisatellite alterations, we deleted ETR1 and POR1, genes that were previously shown to differentially affect the viability of quiescent or nonquiescent cells in stationary phase populations. These experiments revealed that minisatellite alterations in \u0394zrt1 mutants occur exclusively in quiescent stationary phase cells. Finally, we show that loss of ZRT1 stimulates alterations in a derivative of the human HRAS1 minisatellite. We propose that the mechanism of ZRT1-mediated minisatellite instability during quiescence is relevant to human cells, and thus, human disease.",

Among a cohort of 32 XP, we describe the clinical and genetic features of 18 living Comorian black XP patients. We discuss the remarkable clinical differences between white and black XPs. Skin and ocular abnormalities are remarkably precocious and severe XP phenotypes are recognized by the early ocular injuries. In our cohort, the first skin cancer appeared at a median age of 4.5 years with no neurological symptoms. Post-UV DNA repair, cell survival and genetic complementation assigned these patients to the XP group C. All patients exhibited a new G\u00a0\u2192\u00a0C homozygous substitution at 3\u2032-end of XPC intron 12 (IVS 12-1G\u00a0>\u00a0C) leading to the abolition of an acceptor splicing site and the absence of the XPC protein. We found 3 different mRNA isoforms: one with retention of intron 12, one showing exon 13 skipping, and a third with a 44\u00a0bp deletion in exon 13. These 3 isoforms were differently expressed in XP-C cells compared to normal cells. This new mutation found in the Comorian islands, where consanguinity is frequent, represents a founder effect, with an estimated age of about 770 years. Due to the African origin of the black XPs from Mayotte, it would be valuable to search for this mutation in African XPs whenever possible.",

M. tuberculosis treated with N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine induced transcription of the adaA-alkA and adaB genes, suggesting that M. tuberculosis mount an inducible response to methylating agents. Survival assays of the methyltransferase defective Escherichia coli mutant KT233 (ada ogt), showed that expression of the adaB gene rescued the alkylation sensitivity. Further, adaB but not adaA-alkA complemented the hypermutator phenotype of KT233. Purified AdaA-AlkA and AdaB possessed methyltransferase activity. These data suggested that AdaB counteract the cytotoxic and mutagenic effect of O6-methylguanine, while AdaA-AlkA most likely transfers methyl groups from innocuous methylphosphotriesters. AdaA-AlkA did not possess alkylbase DNA glycosylase activity nor rescue the alkylation sensitivity of the E. coli mutant BK2118 (tag alkA). We propose that AdaA-AlkA is a positive regulator of the adaptive response in M. tuberculosis. It thus appears that the ada operon of M. tuberculosis suppresses the mutagenic effect of alkylation but not the cytotoxic effect of lesions such as 3-methylpurines. Collectively, these data indicate that M. tuberculosis hypermutator strains with defective adaptive response genes might sustain robustness to cytotoxic alkylation DNA damage and confer a selective advantage contributing to host adaptation.",

Herein, we present the technical validation of a newly modified HCRA, where nucleofection is used for the transfection of the pmaxGFP plasmid into cryopreserved peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) or lymphoblastoid cell lines. In each sample, 20\u201324\u00a0h after transfection, the relative DNA repair capacity (DRC) was quantified by flow cytometry, comparing the transfection efficiency of nucleoporated cells with undamaged plasmid to those transfected with UV-light damaged plasmid in the seven cell lines that were characterized by different DNA repair phenotypes. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis. We observed a high reproducibility of the relative DRC, transfection efficiency and cell viability. The inter-experimental normalization of the flow cytometry resulted in an increased data accuracy and reproducibility. The amount of cells required for each transfection reaction was reduced fourfold, without affecting the final relative DRC. Furthermore, our HCRA demonstrated strong discrimination power in the UV-light dose\u2013response, both in lymphoblastoid cell lines and cryopreserved PBLs. We also observed a strong correlation of the relative DRC data, when samples were measured against two independent batches of both damaged and undamaged plasmid DNA. The relative DRC variable shows a normal distribution when analyzed in the cryopreserved PBLs from a cohort of 35 lung cancer patients and a 5.59-fold variation in the relative DRC is identified among our patients. The mitotic dynamic was discarded as a confounding factor for the relative DRC measurement in this cohort of patients.

Repair of DSB by recombination can generate mutations and further chromosomal rearrangements, making the regulation of recombination and the choice of recombination pathways of the highest importance. Although knowledge of recombination mechanisms has considerably advanced, the complex interrelationships and regulation of pathways are far from being fully understood.We analyse the different pathways of DSB repair acting in G2/M phase nuclei of irradiated plants, through quantitation of the kinetics of appearance and loss of \u03b3-H2AX foci in Arabidopsis mutants. These analyses show the roles for the four major recombination pathways in post-S-phase DSB repair and that non-homologous recombination pathways constitute the major response. The data suggest a hierarchical organisation of DSB repair in these cells: C-NHEJ acts prior to B-NHEJ which can also inhibit MMEJ. Surprisingly the quadruple ku80 xrcc1 xrcc2 xpf mutant can repair DSB, although with severely altered kinetics. This repair leads to massive genetic instability with more than 50% of mitoses showing anaphase bridges following irradiation. This study thus clarifies the relationships between the different pathways of DSB repair in the living plant and points to the existence of novel DSB repair processes.",

Unexpectedly this study reveals three modes of genetic interactions in response to different types of DNA damage, implying that plant RAD5 and REV3 are also involved in DNA damage responses independent of DDT.

The level of micronucleation in tumor cells has been used to predict prognosis after radiotherapy in many cancers. In order to understand how irradiation-induced micronuclei affect cell fate, we performed extensive long-term live cell imaging on X-irradiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells. To visualize the dynamics of micronuclei more clearly, chromosomes were stably labeled with red fluorescent protein (RFP) by targeting to human histone H2B. Initially, significantly more micronuclei were observed in radiosensitive cells than in radioresistant cells post irradiation. Additionally, cells with micronuclei were found to be more likely to die or undergo cell cycle arrest when compared with micronucleus-free cells after irradiation, and the more micronuclei the cells contained the more likely they would die or undergo arrest. Moreover, micronucleated cells showed predisposition to produce daughter cells with micronuclei through chromosome lagging. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using human pan-centromeric probes revealed that about 70% of these micronuclei and lagging chromosomes did not contain centromeric signals. Finally, DNA damage was more severe and p38 stress kinase activity was higher in micronucleated cells than in micronucleus-free cells as shown by phospho-H2AX and phospho-p38 immunofluorescence staining. Altogether, our observations indicated that the presence of micronuclei coupled with activated DNA damage response could compromise the proliferation capacity of irradiated cells, providing the evidence and justification for using micronucleus index as a valuable biomarker of radiosensitivity.",

We have generated transgenic mice expressing an enzyme in forebrain neurons that causes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage in the form of abasic-sites, creating mtDNA toxicity. Here, we report that mitochondrial distribution is disturbed in hippocampal neurons of these mice. Moreover, mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial transcription are reduced, and oxidative stress is increased. There is also a loss of receptors at excitatory glutamatergic synapses in the dentate gyrus, and the size of the postsynaptic density in this region is abnormal. We speculate that the loss of synaptic mitochondria caused by accumulation in the neuronal cell body contributes to the observed synaptic abnormalities, as well as the overall loss of mtDNA and diminished mitochondrial transcription. Collectively, these changes lead to mitochondria with reduced function and increased oxidative stress.",

DHX9 melts simple DNA\u2013DNA, RNA\u2013RNA, and DNA\u2013RNA strands with a 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 polarity; despite this little is known about its substrate specificity. Here, we used partial duplex DNA consisting of M13mp18 DNA and oligonucleotide-based replication and recombination intermediates. We show that DHX9 unwinds DNA- and RNA-containing forks, DNA- and RNA-containing displacement loops (D- and R-loops), and also G-quadruplexes. With these substrates, DHX9 behaved similarly as the RecQ helicase WRN. In contrast to WRN, DHX9 melted RNA-hybrids considerably faster than the corresponding DNA\u2013DNA strands. DHX9 preferably unwound R-loops and DNA-based G-quadruplexes indicating that these structures may be biologically relevant. DHX9 also unwound RNA-based G-quadruplexes that have been reported to occur in human transcripts. It is believed that an improper dissolution of co-transcriptionally formed D-loops, R-loops, and DNA- or RNA-based G-quadruplexes represent potential roadblocks for transcription and thereby enhance transcription associated recombination events. By unwinding these structures, DHX9 may significantly contribute to transcriptional activation and also to the maintenance of genomic stability.",

Among several proteins required for eukaryotic MMR, MutL\u03b1 is a heterodimer comprised of Mlh1 and Pms1. The two proteins dimerize along their C-terminal domains (CTDs), and the CTD of Pms1 houses a latent endonuclease that is required for MMR. The highly conserved N-terminal domains (NTDs) independently bind DNA and possess ATPase active sites. Here we use two protein footprinting techniques, limited proteolysis and oxidative surface mapping, coupled with mass spectrometry to identify amino acids involved along the DNA-binding surface of the Pms1-NTD. Limited proteolysis experiments elucidated several basic residues that were protected in the presence of DNA, while oxidative surface mapping revealed one residue that is uniquely protected from oxidation. Furthermore, additional amino acids distributed throughout the Pms1-NTD were protected from oxidation either in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP or DNA, indicating that each ligand stabilizes the protein in a similar conformation. Based on the recently published X-ray crystal structure of yeast Pms1-NTD, a model of the Pms1-NTD/DNA complex was generated using the mass spectrometric data as constraints. The proposed model defines the DNA-binding interface along a positively charged groove of the Pms1-NTD and complements prior mutagenesis studies of Escherichia coli and eukaryotic MutL.",

In addition to reactive oxygen produced as a byproduct of their own metabolism, intracellular parasites also have to manage oxidative stress generated as a defense mechanism by the host. The spontaneous loss of DNA bases due to hydrolysis and oxidative DNA damage in intracellular parasites is great, but little is known about the type of DNA repair machineries that exist in these early-branching eukaryotes. However, it is clear, processes similar to DNA base excision repair (BER) must exist to rectify spontaneous and host-mediated damage in Toxoplasma gondii. Here we report that T. gondii, an opportunistic protozoan pathogen, possesses two apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases that function in DNA BER. We characterize the enzymatic activities of Toxoplasma exonuclease III (ExoIII, or Ape1) and endonuclease IV (EndoIV, or Apn1), designated TgAPE and TgAPN, respectively. Over-expression of TgAPN in Toxoplasma conferred protection from DNA damage, and viable knockouts of TgAPN were not obtainable. We generated an inducible TgAPN knockdown mutant using a ligand-controlled destabilization domain to establish that TgAPN is critical for Toxoplasma to recover from DNA damage. The importance of TgAPN and the fact that humans lack any observable APN family activity highlights TgAPN as a promising candidate for drug development to treat toxoplasmosis.",

In strains encoding a mutator allele of Pol \u025b (pol2-M644G), failure to remove rNMPs from DNA due to deletion of the RNH201 gene encoding the catalytic subunit of RNase H2, results in deletion of 2\u20135 base pairs in short repetitive sequences. Deletion rates depend on the orientation of the reporter gene relative to a nearby replication origin, suggesting that mutations result from rNMPs incorporated during replication. Here we demonstrate that 2\u20135 base pair deletion mutagenesis also strongly increases in rnh201\u0394 strains encoding wild type DNA polymerases. As in the pol2-M644G strains, the deletions occur at repetitive sequences and are orientation-dependent, suggesting that mismatches involving misaligned strands arise that could be subject to mismatch repair. Unexpectedly however, 2\u20135 base pair deletion rates resulting from loss of RNH201 in the pol2-M644G strain are unaffected by concomitant loss of MSH3, MSH6, or both. It could be that the mismatch repair machinery is unable to repair mismatches resulting from unrepaired rNMPs incorporated into DNA by M644G Pol \u025b, but this possibility is belied by the observation that Msh2\u2013Msh6 can bind to a ribonucleotide-containing mismatch. Alternatively, following incorporation of rNMPs by M644G Pol \u025b during replication, the conversion of unrepaired rNMPs into mutations may occur outside the context of replication, e.g., during the repair of nicks resulting from rNMPs in DNA.

     "abstract": "UvrA is the initial DNA damage-sensing protein in bacterial nucleotide excision repair. Each protomer of the UvrA dimer contains two ATPase domains, that belong to the family of ATP-binding cassette domains. Three structural domains are inserted in these ATPase domains: the insertion domain (ID) and UvrB binding domain (in ATP domain I) and the zinc-finger motif (in ATP domain II). In this paper we analyze the function of the ID and the zinc finger motif in damage specific binding of Escherichia coli UvrA.We show that the ID is not essential for damage discrimination, but it does stabilize UvrA on the DNA, most likely by forming a clamp around the DNA helix. We present evidence that two conserved arginine residues in the ID contact the phosphate backbone of the DNA, leading to strand separation after the ATPase-driven movement of the ID's. Remarkably, deletion of the ID generated a phenotype in which UV-survival strongly depends on the presence of photolyase, indicating that UvrA and photolyase form a ternary complex on a CPD-lesion.The zinc-finger motif is shown to be important for the transfer of the damage recognition signal to the ATPase of UvrA. In the absence of this domain the coupling between DNA binding and ATP hydrolysis is completely lost. Mutation of the phenylalanine residue in the tip of the zinc-finger domain resulted in a protein in which the ATPase was already triggered when binding to an undamaged site. As the zinc-finger motif is connected to the DNA binding regions on the surface of UvrA, this strongly suggests that damage-specific binding to these regions results in a rearrangement of the zinc-finger motif, which in its turn activates the ATPase. We present a model how damage recognition is transmitted to activate ATP hydrolysis in ATP binding domain I of the protein.",

Mismatch repair is a well described pathway for the suppression of microsatellite instability. However, the cellular polymerases responsible for generating microsatellite errors have not been fully described. We address this gap in knowledge by measuring the fidelity of recombinant yeast polymerase \u03b4 (Pol \u03b4) and \u025b (Pol \u025b) holoenzymes during synthesis of a [GT/CA] microsatellite. The in vitro HSV-tk forward assay was used to measure DNA polymerase errors generated during gap-filling of complementary GT10 and CA10-containing substrates and \u223c90 nucleotides of HSV-tk coding sequence surrounding the microsatellites. The observed mutant frequencies within the microsatellites were 4 to 30-fold higher than the observed mutant frequencies within the coding sequence. More specifically, the rate of Pol \u03b4 and Pol \u025b misalignment-based insertion/deletion errors within the microsatellites was \u223c1000-fold higher than the rate of insertion/deletion errors within the HSV-tk gene. Although the most common microsatellite error was the deletion of a single repeat unit, \u223c 20% of errors were deletions of two or more units for both polymerases. The differences in fidelity for wild type enzymes and their exonuclease-deficient derivatives were \u223c2-fold for unit-based microsatellite insertion/deletion errors. Interestingly, the exonucleases preferentially removed potentially stabilizing interruption errors within the microsatellites. Since Pol \u03b4 and Pol \u025b perform not only the bulk of DNA replication in eukaryotic cells but also are implicated in performing DNA synthesis associated with repair and recombination, these results indicate that microsatellite errors may be introduced into the genome during multiple DNA metabolic pathways.",

We identified 274 genes affecting a large variety of cellular functions that are required for cell growth when SRS2 or its mutants are overexpressed. Further analysis of these interactions reveals that Srs2 acts independently of its helicase function at replication forks likely through its recruitment by the sumoylated PCNA replication clamp. This helicase-independent function is responsible for the negative interactions with DNA metabolism genes and for the toxicity of SRS2 overexpression in many of the diverse cellular pathways revealed in our screens.",

The key FA protein FANCD2 is phosphorylated on Ser 222 by ATM after ionizing radiation (IR), thus allowing normal activation of the S-phase checkpoint, and ATM cells are known to be hypersensitive to oxidative damage. In this work we show that FANCD2 deficient cells have a defective S-phase checkpoint after Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) induced oxidative damage. ATM dependent phosphorylation of FANCD2 at the S222 residue is necessary for normal S-phase checkpoint activation after oxidative stress, while FANCD2 monoubiquitination at K561 is dispensable. We also show that FANCD2 is not required for base excision repair of 8-oxoG and other DNA lesions (abasic sites, uracils), while treatments that exclusively induce 8-oxoG, but not DNA double strand breaks, fail to activate FANCD2 monoubiquitination, thus indicating that the known accumulation of 8-oxoG in FA cells reflects an overproduction of ROS rather than defective processing of oxidized bases.We conclude that the handling of DNA damage after H2O2-induced oxidative stress requires the coordinated action of FANCD2 and ATM.",

Recently, wt and mutant outcomes have been compared at one or two doses. The criterion for parallel pathways was \u201cadditivity\u201d: wt positive outcomes roughly equal to numerical sums of single-mutant positive outcomes or double-mutant negative outcomes equal to sums of single-mutant negative outcomes. For redundant pathways, wt positive outcomes or double-mutant negative outcomes were postulated to be \u201cgreater-than-additive\u201d relative to single-mutant sums. Equations derived here to describe parallel and redundant pathways provide no rigorous theoretical justification for these criteria. Furthermore, simulations using these equations generate additive or greater-than-additive outcomes for both parallel and redundant pathways, depending on the values chosen for various parameters. Proposed new methods to compare wt vs. mutant plots of negative outcomes against doses of genotoxic agents yield three different but complementary estimates of resistances to DNA damage: respective plot slopes where mutant and wt outcomes are the same (inversely proportional to instantaneous damage-resistance strengths), respective total doses that cause the same outcomes (total resistance capacities), and respective dose thresholds where negative outcomes are first detected. Analyses of experimental examples suggest that greater-than additive threshold doses provide the most straightforward criteria for pathway redundancy.",

In the present study, we investigated whether this response of subtelomeric regions to DSBs is a result of a deficiency in DSB repair by comparing the frequency of homologous recombination repair (HRR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) at interstitial and telomeric sites following the introduction of DSBs by I-SceI endonuclease. We also monitored the frequency of small deletions, which have been shown to be the most common mutation at I-SceI-induced DSBs at interstitial sites. We observed no difference in the frequency of small deletions or HRR at interstitial and subtelomeric DSBs. However, the frequency of NHEJ was significantly lower at DSBs near telomeres compared to interstitial sites. The frequency of NHEJ was also lower at DSBs occurring at interstitial sites containing telomeric repeat sequences. We propose that regions near telomeres are deficient in classical NHEJ as a result of the presence of cis-acting telomere-binding proteins that cause DSBs to be processed as though they were telomeres, resulting in excessive resection, telomere loss, and eventual chromosome rearrangements by alternative NHEJ.",

     "abstract": "Repair of G\u00b7T mismatches arising from deamination of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) involves excision of thymine and restoration of a G\u00b7C pair via base excision repair (BER). Thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) is one of two mammalian enzymes that can specifically remove thymine from G\u00b7T mispairs. While TDG can excise other bases, it maintains stringent specificity for a CpG context, suggesting deaminated m5C is an important biological substrate. Recent studies reveal TDG is essential for embryogenesis; it helps to maintain an active chromatin complex and initiates BER to counter aberrant de novo CpG methylation, which may involve excision of actively deaminated m5C. The relatively weak G\u00b7T activity of TDG has been implicated in the hypermutability of CpG sites, which largely involves C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T transitions arising from m5C deamination. Thus, it is important to understand how TDG recognizes and process substrates, particularly G\u00b7T mispairs. Here, we extend our detailed studies of TDG by examining the dependence of substrate binding and catalysis on pH, ionic strength, and temperature. Catalytic activity is relatively constant for pH 5.5\u20139, but falls sharply for pH\u00a0>\u00a09 due to severely weakened substrate binding, and, potentially, ionization of the target base. Substrate binding and catalysis diminish sharply with increasing ionic strength, particularly for G\u00b7T substrates, due partly to effects on nucleotide flipping. TDG aggregates rapidly and irreversibly at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, but can be stabilized by specific and nonspecific DNA. The temperature dependence of catalysis reveals large and unexpected differences for G\u00b7U and G\u00b7T substrates, where G\u00b7T activity exhibits much steeper temperature dependence. The results suggest that reversible nucleotide flipping is much more rapid for G\u00b7T substrates, consistent with our previous findings that steric effects limit the active-site lifetime of thymine, which may account for the relatively weak G\u00b7T activity.

This marker-dependent recombination pathway was identified as a repair of mismatches in recombination heteroduplexes. We suggested that the first step in this pathway, recognition and incision of the mismatch, is performed by endonuclease VII (endo VII) encoded by the T4 gene 49. In the present paper, we tested this hypothesis in vivo. We used an experimental model system that combines site-specific double-strand breaks with the famous advantages of the recombination analysis of bacteriophage T4 rII mutants. We compared recombination of homoallelic HR and LR markers in the S17 and S17 E727 background (amber mutations in the uvsX and in the uvsX and 49 genes, respectively). In S17-crosses, the HR and LR markers retain their respective high-recombination and low-recombination behavior. In S17 E727-crosses, however, the HR and LR markers show no difference in the recombination frequency and both behave as LR markers. We conclude that endo VII is the enzyme that recognizes mismatches in recombinational heteroduplexes and performs their incision. This role for endo VII was suggested previously from biochemical studies, but this is its first in vivo demonstration.",

Excessive tolerance of sequence heterology may compromise the fidelity of repair of DNA double-strand breaks. In this study, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was used to monitor the heterology tolerance of human Rad51 mediated strand exchange reactions, in real time, by introducing either G-T or I-C mismatched base pairs between the two homologous DNA strands. The strand exchange reactions were much more sensitive to G-T than to I-C base pairs. These results imply that the recognition of homology and the tolerance of heterology by hRad51 may depend on the local structural motif adopted by the base pairs participating in strand exchange.

In this study, we examined the physiological roles of H. pylori RecRO pathway in DNA recombinational repair. We characterized H. pylori single mutants in recR and in recO, genes in the putative gap repair recombination pathway, and an addA recO double mutant that is thus deficient in both pathways that initiate DNA recombinational repair. The recR or recO single mutants showed the same level of sensitivity to mitomycin C as the parent strain, suggesting that the RecRO pathway is not responsible for the repair of DNA double strand breaks. However, H. pylori recR and recO mutants are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and separately to acid stress, two major stress conditions that H. pylori encounters in its physiological niche. The complementation of the recR mutant restored the sensitivity to oxidative and acid stress to the wild type level. By measuring DNA transformation frequencies, the recR and recO single mutants were shown to have no effect on inter-genomic recombination, whereas the addA recO double mutant had a greatly (\u223c12-fold) reduced transformation frequency. On the other hand, the RecRO pathway was shown to play a significant role in intra-genomic recombination with direct repeat sequences. Whereas the recA strain had a deletion frequency 35-fold lower than that of background level, inactivation of recR resulted in a 4-fold decrease in deletion frequency. In a mouse infection model, the three mutant strains displayed a greatly reduced ability to colonize the host stomachs.

During the DNA damage response, phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase and checkpoint kinase Chk2 induces the stabilization of Che-1 protein, which is critical for the maintenance of G2/M arrest. In this study we showed that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, beyond phosphorylation, is involved in the regulation of Che-1 stabilization following DNA damage. We demonstrated that Che-1 accumulation upon doxorubicin treatment is reduced after the inhibition of PARP activity in HCT116 cells and in PARP-1 knock-out or silenced cells. In accordance, impairment in Che-1 accumulation by PARP inhibition reduced Che-1 occupancy at p21 promoter and affected the expression of the corresponding gene. Epistasis experiments showed that the effect of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on Che-1 stabilization is independent from ATM kinase activity. Indeed we demonstrated that Che-1 protein co-immunoprecipitates with ADP-ribose polymers and that PARP-1 directly interacts with Che-1, promoting its modification in vitro and in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Maintaining genome integrity in germ cells is important, given that the germ cells produce the next generation of offspring. Base excision repair is a DNA repair pathway that is responsible for the repair of most endogenous DNA damage. A key enzyme that functions in this repair pathway is DNA polymerase beta (Pol \u03b2). We previously used conditional gene targeting to engineer mice with sperm deleted of the Pol B gene, which encodes Pol \u03b2. We characterized mutagenesis in the sperm of these mice and compared it to wild-type and mice heterozygous for the Pol B gene. We found that sperm obtained that were heterozygously or homozygously deleted of the Pol B gene exhibited increased mutation frequencies compared to wild-type sperm. We identified an increase in transition mutations in both heterozygously and homozygously deleted sperm, and the types of mutations induced suggest that a polymerase other than Pol \u03b2 functions in its absence. Interestingly, most of the transversions we observed were induced only in heterozygous, compared with wild-type sperm. Our results suggest that haploinsufficiency of Pol \u03b2 leads to increased frequencies and varieties of mutations. Our study also shows that Pol \u03b2 is critical for genome stability in the germline.",

We analyzed all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 125 DNA repair genes covered by the Illumina HumanHap300 (v1.1) BeadChips in a previously conducted genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 1154 lung cancer cases and 1137 controls and replicated the top-hits of XRCC4 SNPs in an independent set of 597 cases and 611 controls in Texas populations. We found that six of 20 XRCC4 SNPs were associated with a decreased risk of lung cancer with a P-value of 0.01 or lower in the discovery dataset, of which the most significant SNP was rs10040363 (P for allelic test\u00a0=\u00a04.89\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124). Moreover, the data in this region allowed us to impute a potentially functional SNP rs2075685 (imputed P for allelic test\u00a0=\u00a01.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123). A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that the rs2075685G\u00a0>\u00a0T change in the XRCC4 promoter increased expression of the gene. In the replication study of rs10040363, rs1478486, rs9293329, and rs2075685, however, only rs10040363 achieved a borderline association with a decreased risk of lung cancer in a dominant model (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.80, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.62\u20131.03 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.079). In the final combined analysis of both the Texas GWAS discovery and replication datasets, the strength of the association was increased for rs10040363 (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.77, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.66\u20130.89, Pdominant\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 and P for trend\u00a0=\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124) and rs1478486 (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.82, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.71\u20130.94, Pdominant\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 and P for trend\u00a0=\u00a03.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123). Finally, we conducted a meta-analysis of these XRCC4 SNPs with available data from published GWA studies of lung cancer with a total of 12,312 cases and 47,921 controls, in which none of these XRCC4 SNPs was associated with lung cancer risk. It appeared that rs2075685, although associated with increased expression of a reporter gene and lung cancer risk in the Texas populations, did not have an effect on lung cancer risk in other populations.

RAD59 is required for RAD51-independent inverted-repeat recombination, but no clear mechanism for how recombination occurs in the absence of RAD51 has emerged. Because Rad59 is thought to function as an accessory factor for the single-strand annealing activity of Rad52 one possible mechanism for spontaneous recombination could be by strand annealing between repeats at a stalled replication fork. Here we demonstrate the importance of the Rad52 single-strand annealing activity for generating recombinants by showing suppression of the rad52\u0394, rad51\u0394 rad52\u0394 and rad52\u0394 rad59\u0394 inverted-repeat recombination defects by the rfa1-D228Y mutation. In addition, formation of recombinants in the rad51\u0394 mutant was sensitive to the distance between the inverted repeats, consistent with a replication-based mechanism. Deletion of RAD5 or RAD18, which are required for error-free post-replication repair, reduced the recombination rate in the rad59\u0394 mutant, but not in wild type. These data are consistent with RAD51-independent recombinants arising by a faulty template switch mechanism that is distinct from nascent strand template switching.",

To study the influence of BLM on double-strand break (DSB) repair in human chromosomes, we stably transfected a normal human cell line with a DNA substrate that contained a thymidine kinase (tk)-neo fusion gene disrupted by the recognition site for endonuclease I-SceI. The substrate also contained a closely linked functional tk gene to serve as a recombination partner for the tk-neo fusion gene. We derived two cell lines each containing a single integrated copy of the DNA substrate. In these cell lines, a DSB was introduced within the tk-neo fusion gene by expression of I-SceI. DSB repair events that occurred via homologous recombination (HR) or nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) were recovered by selection for G418-resistant clones. DSB repair was examined under conditions of either normal BLM expression or reduced BLM expression brought about by RNA interference. We report that BLM knockdown in both cell lines specifically increased the frequency of HR events that produced deletions by crossovers or single-strand annealing while leaving the frequency of gene conversions unchanged or reduced. We observed no change in the accuracy of individual HR events and no substantial alteration of the nature of individual NHEJ events when BLM expression was reduced. Our work provides the first direct evidence that BLM influences DSB repair pathway choice in human chromosomes and suggests that BLM deficiency can engender genomic instability by provoking an increased frequency of HR events of a potentially deleterious nature.",

The ultra-high resolution of TEM offers the intriguing possibility of detecting core components of the DNA repair machinery at the single-molecule level and visualizing their molecular interactions with specific histone modifications. By labeling phosphorylated Ku70, which binds directly to broken DNA ends in preparation for rejoining, this TEM approach can monitor formation and repair of actual DSBs in euchromatic versus heterochromatic regions. While DNA lesions in euchromatin are detected and rejoined without any delay, DNA packaging in heterochromatin appears to retard DSB processing, leading to slower repair kinetics. Of significance, the assembly of \u03b3H2AX, MDC1, and 53BP1 occurs exclusively at DSBs in heterochromatic (characterized by H3K9me3), but not euchromatic domains, suggesting involvement in localized chromatin decondensation (which increases heterochromatic DNA accessibility).

Monoubiquitination (PCNA-Ub) at lysine residue 164 (K164) stimulates error-prone translesion synthesis (TLS), Rad5-dependent polyubiquitination (PCNA-Ubn) stimulates error-free template switching (TS). To generate high affinity antibodies by somatic hypermutation (SHM), B cells profit from error-prone TLS polymerases. Consistent with the role of PCNA-Ub in stimulating TLS, hypermutated B cells of PCNAK164R mutant mice display a defect in generating selective point mutations. Two Rad5 orthologs, HLTF and SHPRH have been identified as alternative E3 ligases generating PCNA-Ubn in mammals. As PCNA-Ub and PCNA-Ubn both make use of K164, error-free PCNA-Ubn-dependent TS may suppress error-prone PCNA-Ub-dependent TLS. To determine a regulatory role of Shprh and Hltf in SHM, we generated Shprh/Hltf double mutant mice. Interestingly, while the formation of PCNA-Ub and PCNA-Ubn is prohibited in PCNAK164R MEFs, the formation of PCNA-Ubn is not abolished in Shprh/Hltf mutant MEFs. In line with these observations Shprh/Hltf double mutant B cells were not hypersensitive to DNA damage. Furthermore, SHM was normal in Shprh/Hltf mutant B cells.

The MMR proteins Msh2 and Msh6 are highly elevated in mouse ES cells compared with mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), as are Pms2 and Mlh1, albeit to a lesser extent. Cells transfected with an MMR reporter plasmid showed that MMR repair capacity is low in MEFs, but highly active in wildtype ES cells. As expected, an ES cell line defective in MMR was several-fold less effective in repair level than wildtype ES cells. Like proteins that participate in MMR, the level of proteins involved in BER was elevated in ES cells compared with MEFs. When BER activity was examined biochemically using a uracil-containing oligonucleotide template, repair activity was higher in ES cells compared with MEFs. The data are consistent with the suggestion that ES cells have multiple mechanisms, including highly active MMR and BER that preserve genetic integrity and minimize the accumulation of mutations.",

PSF and PSF-containing complexes stimulate double-strand break repair in cell free systems, most likely via direct interaction with the repair substrate. Prior in vitro studies are, however, insufficient to demonstrate whether PSF contributes to DNA repair in living cells. Here, we investigate the effect of miRNA-mediated PSF knockdown in human (HeLa) cells. We find that PSF is essential for reproductive viability. To circumvent this and investigate the DNA damage sensitivity phenotype, we established a genetic rescue assay based on co-transfection of PSF miRNA and mutant PSF expression constructs. Mutational analysis suggests that sequences required for viability and radioresistance are partially separable, and that the latter requires a unique N-terminal PSF domain. As an independent means to investigate PSF sequences involved in DNA repair, we established an assay based on real-time relocalization of PSF-containing complexes to sites of dense, laser-induced DNA damage in living cells. We show that relocalization is driven by sequences in PSF, rather than its dimerization partner, p54nrb/NONO, and that sequences required for relocalization reside in the same N-terminal domain that contributes to radioresistance. Further evidence for the importance of PSF sequences in mediating relocalization is provided by observations that PSF promotes relocalization of a third protein, PSPC1, under conditions where p54nrb is limiting. Together, these observations support the model derived from prior biochemical studies that PSF influences repair via direct, local, interaction with the DNA substrate.",

     "abstract": "Azidothymidine (AZT, zidovudine) is used to treat HIV-AIDS and prevent maternal transmission to newborns. Because the azido group replaces the 3\u2032 OH of thymidine, AZT is believed to act as a chain terminator during reverse transcription of viral RNA into DNA, although other mechanisms of viral inhibition have been suggested. There is evidence that AZT is genotoxic, particularly to the mitochondria. In this study, we use the bacterium Escherichia coli to investigate the mechanism of AZT toxicity and the cellular mechanisms that aid survival. We show that that replication arrests quickly after treatment, accompanied by induction of the SOS DNA damage response. AZT appears to produce single-strand DNA gaps, as evident by RecF-dependent induction of the SOS response and visualization of single-strand DNA binding protein foci within the cell. Some of these gaps must be converted to breaks, since mutants in the RecBCD nuclease, required for recombinational double-strand break repair, are highly sensitive to AZT. Blocks in the late recombination functions, the RuvAB branch migration helicase and RuvC Holliday junction endonuclease, caused extreme AZT sensitivity that could be relieved by mutations in the early recombination functions, such as RecF, suggesting gaps engage in recombination reactions. Finally, our data suggest that the proofreading exonucleases of DNA polymerases play little role in AZT tolerance. Rather, Exonuclease III appears to be the enzyme that removes AZT: xthA mutants are highly AZT-sensitive, with a sustained SOS response, and overproduction of the enzyme protects wild-type cells. Our findings suggest that incorporation of AZT into human nuclear and mitochondrial DNA has the potential to promote genetic instability and toxicity through the production of ssDNA gaps and dsDNA breaks, and predicts that the human Exonuclease III ortholog, APE1, will be important for drug tolerance.",

Recently, the Smc5/6 complex has been reported to be important for telomere maintenance in yeast and also in cancerous human ALT cells, where it could function in a homologous recombination-based (HR) telomere maintenance pathway. Here, we investigate the possible roles of the budding yeast Smc5/6 complex in maintaining appropriate chromosome end-structures allowing cell survival in absence of telomerase. The results show that cells harbouring mutant alleles of genes encoding Smc5/6-complex proteins rapidly stop growing after telomerase loss. Furthermore, this telomerase-induced growth arrest is much more pronounced as compared to cultures with a functional Smc5/6-complex. Bulk telomere sequence loss is not increased in the mutant cells and the evidence suggests that Smc5/6 slows senescence through a partially HR-independent pathway. We propose that in yeast, the Smc5/6-complex is required for efficient and timely termination of DNA replication and repair at telomeres to avoid stochastic telomere loss during cell division. Consistent with this hypothesis, sequencing of telomeres from telomerase-positive smc5/6 mutant cells revealed a higher frequency of telomere breakage events. Finally, the results also show that on dysfunctional telomeres, the generation of 3\u2032-single stranded DNA is impaired, suggesting that the complex may also participate in the formation of single-stranded overhangs which are thought to be the substrates for telomere repeat replenishment in the absence of telomerase.",

We performed epistasis analysis between \u0394mms1 and mutants of pathways with known functions in genome integrity, and measured the recruitment of homologous recombination proteins to blocked replication forks and recombination frequencies. We show that, in S. pombe, the functions of Mms1 and the conserved components of the Cullin 4 ubiquitin ligase, Pcu4 and Ddb1, do not significantly overlap. Furthermore, unlike in S. cerevisiae, the function of the H3K56 acetylase Rtt109 is not essential for Mms1 function. We provide evidence that Mms1 function is particularly important when a single strand break is converted into a double strand break during replication. Genetic data connect Mms1 to a Mus81 and Rad22Rad52 dependent, but Rhp51 independent, branch of homologous recombination. This is supported by results demonstrating that Mms1 is recruited to a site-specific replication fork barrier and that, in a \u0394mms1 strain, Rad22Rad52 and RPA recruitment to blocked forks are reduced, whereas Rhp51 recruitment is unaffected. In addition, Mms1 appears to specifically promote chromosomal rearrangements in a recombination assay.

We propose that in archaea RPA acts as a platform for loading of Hel308 onto aberrant single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that arises at blocked replication forks.

We investigated the distorting influence of endogenous, assay-inherent factors onto base (single cell level) and primary outcome measures (experimental/slide level), such as olive tail moment (OTM) and percentage DNA in the tail (%tail-DNA). From 2003 to 2008, we performed the assay on lymphocytes isolated from the blood samples of 355 lung cancer patients, 170 controls, and 610 relatives, as well as one single reference individual, repeated 170 times. In total, the data from 10,016 single experiments containing around 1,750,000 cells have been included in this study. This is the first time that the endogenous variability of the COMET assay has been validated systematically on such a huge data set over a 5 year period.Assuming that the reference sample reflects assay specific white noise, we estimated a proportion of 7\u201395% of the variability of the outcome measures due to assay variation (white noise) depending on parameter, exposure level, and study group. The proportion of white noise was largest for the initial radiation damage. The specific endogenous factors considered attribute to 14.8% of the total variability in the primary outcome measurements of the OTM and 6.9% of the %tail-DNA. OTM turns out to be a sensitive parameter to detect variation, but is also more susceptible to disturbance caused by endogenous factors than %tail-DNA.To reduce the experimental variability in COMET assays, we recommend a highly standardized operation protocol as well as inspecting and/or adjusting the primary outcome measures according to endogenous factors before calculating secondary outcome measures, e.g. DNA repair capacity (DRC) or testing statistical inference. A human reference (HR) sample is also useful to inspect homogeneity in the temporal progression of long lasting investigations, but not for calibrating primary outcome measurements.",

This targeting requires that the same deamination event be repaired either by a mutagenic or a high-fidelity pathway depending on the genomic location. We have previously shown that the BRCT domain of the DNA-damage sensor PARP-1 is required for mutagenic repair occurring in the context of IgH and IgL diversification in the chicken B cell line DT40. Here we show that immunoprecipitation of the BRCT domain of PARP-1 pulls down Ku70 and the DNA\u2013PK complex although the BRCT domain of PARP-1 does not bind DNA, suggesting that this interaction is not DNA dependent. Through sequencing the IgL variable region in PARP-1\u2212/\u2212 cells that also lack Ku70 or Lig4, we show that Ku70 or Lig4 deficiency restores GCV to PARP-1\u2212/\u2212 cells and conclude that the mechanism by which PARP-1 is promoting mutagenic repair is by inhibiting high-fidelity repair which would otherwise be mediated by Ku70 and Lig4.",

Long tracts of ssDNA are also required for activation of the ATR-mediated checkpoint response. Thus, identifying the proteins required and the underlying mechanism for DNA end resection has been an intense area of investigation. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae show that end resection takes place in two steps. Initially, a short oligonucleotide tract is removed from the 5\u2032 strand to create an early intermediate with a short 3\u2032 overhang. Then in a second step the early intermediate is rapidly processed generating an extensive tract of ssDNA. The first step is dependent on the highly conserved Mre11\u2013Rad50\u2013Xrs2 complex and Sae2, while the second step employs the exonuclease Exo1 and/or the helicase\u2013topoisomerase complex Sgs1\u2013Top3\u2013Rmi1 with the endonuclease Dna2.

     "abstract": "Due to its link with human pathologies, including cancer, the mechanism of Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) has been extensively studied. Most of the pathway and players have been defined using in vitro reconstitution experiments. However, in vivo, the NER machinery must deal with the presence of organized chromatin, which in some regions, such as heterochromatin, is highly condensed but still susceptible to DNA damage. A series of events involving different chromatin-remodeling factors and histone-modifying enzymes target chromatin regions that contain DNA lesions. CPDs change the structure of the nucleosome, allowing access to factors that can recognize the lesion. Next, DDB1\u2013DDB2 protein complexes, which mono-ubiquitinate histones H2A, H3, and H4, recognize nucleosomes containing DNA lesions. The ubiquitinated nucleosome facilitates the recruitment of ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors and the XPC\u2013HR23B\u2013Centrin 2 complex to the target region. Different ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling factors, such as SWI/SNF and INO80, have been identified as having roles in the UV irradiation response prior to the action of the NER machinery. Subsequently, remodeling of the nucleosome allows enzymatic reactions by histone-modifying factors that may acetylate, methylate or demethylate specific histone residues. Intriguingly, some of these histone modifications are dependent on p53. These histone modifications and the remodeling of the nucleosome allow the entrance of TFIIH, XPC and other NER factors that remove the damaged strand; then, gap-filling DNA synthesis and ligation reactions are carried out after excision of the oligonucleotide with the lesion. Finally, after DNA repair, the initial chromatin structure has to be reestablished. Therefore, factors that modulate chromatin dynamics contribute to the NER mechanism, and they are significant in the future design of treatments for human pathologies related to genome instability and the appearance of drug-resistant tumors.",

In addition to performing a variety of functions during mitotic growth, Exo1 is also important for the production of crossovers during meiosis. However, its precise molecular role has remained ambiguous and several models have been proposed to account for the crossover deficit observed in its absence. Here, we present physical evidence that the nuclease activity of Exo1 is essential for normal 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 resection at the Spo11-dependent HIS4 hotspot in otherwise wild-type cells. This same activity was also required for normal levels of gene conversion at the locus. However, gene conversions were frequently observed at a distance beyond that at which resection was readily detectable arguing that it is not the extent of the initial DNA end resection that limits heteroduplex formation. In addition to these nuclease-dependent functions, we found that an exo1-D173A mutant defective in nuclease activity is able to maintain crossing-over at wild-type levels in a number of genetic intervals, suggesting that Exo1 also plays a nuclease-independent role in crossover promotion.",

     "abstract": "During meiosis DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are induced and repaired by homologous recombination to create gene conversion and crossover products. Mostly these DSBs are made by Spo11, which covalently binds to the DSB ends. More rarely in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, other meiotic DSBs are formed by self-homing endonucleases such as VDE, which is site specific and does not covalently bind to the DSB ends. We have used experimentally located VDE-DSB sites to analyse an intermediate step in homologous recombination, resection of the single-strand ending 5\u2032 at the DSB site. Analysis of strains with different mutant alleles of MRE11 (mre11-58S and mre11-H125N) and deleted for EXO1 indicated that these two nucleases make significant contributions to repair of VDE-DSBs. Physical analysis of single-stranded repair intermediates indicates that efficient initiation and processivity of resection at VDE-DSBs require both Mre11 and Exo1, with loss of function for either protein causing severe delay in resection. We propose that these experiments model what happens at Spo11-DSBs after removal of the covalently bound protein, and that Mre11 and Exo1 are the major nucleases involved in creating resection tracts of widely varying lengths typical of meiotic recombination.",

     "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited disease characterized by bone marrow failure, increased cancer risk and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, implying a role for this pathway in the maintenance of genomic stability. The central player of the FA pathway is the multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase complex activated through a replication- and DNA damage-dependent mechanism. A consequence of the activation of the complex is the monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 and FANCI, late term effectors in the maintenance of genome integrity. The details regarding the coordination of the FA-dependent response and the DNA replication process are still mostly unknown. We found, by yeast two-hybrid assay and co-immunoprecipitation in human cells, that the core complex subunit FANCF physically interacts with PSF2, a member of the GINS complex essential for both the initiation and elongation steps of DNA replication. In HeLa cells depleted for PSF2, we observed a decreased binding to chromatin of the FA core complex, suggesting that the GINS complex may have a role in either loading or stabilizing the FA core complex onto chromatin. Consistently, GINS and core complex bind chromatin contemporarily upon origin firing and PSF2 depletion sensitizes cells to DNA cross-linking agents. However, depletion of PSF2 is not sufficient to reduce monoubiquitylation of FANCD2 or its localization to nuclear foci following DNA damage. Our results suggest a novel crosstalk between DNA replication and the FA pathway.",

SSCs must therefore have robust response mechanisms to counteract the potentially deleterious effects of DNA damage, with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) representing the greatest threat to genomic integrity. Through in vivo analysis of the DNA damage response of SSCs within their physiological tissue context, we aimed to gain insights into the mechanisms by which SSCs preserve genome integrity. After whole-body irradiation of repair-proficient and repair-deficient (DNA-PK- and ATM-deficient) mice, the formation and rejoining of DSBs was analyzed in SSCs of testis compared with somatic cells of other tissues by enumerating \u03b3H2AX-, MDC1-, and 53BP1-foci. Caspase-3 and PARP-1 were used as markers for apoptotic cell death. Our results show that DNA damage response mechanisms in SSCs characterized by unique chromatin compositions are markedly different from those of somatic cells. In SSCs lacking compact heterochromatin, histone-associated signaling components of the DNA repair machinery are completely absent and radiation-induced DSBs are rejoined predominantly by DNA-PK-independent pathways, suggesting the existence of alternative repair mechanisms. As a complimentary mechanism characterized by low thresholds for ATM-dependent checkpoint activation, the differentiating progeny, but not the SSCs themselves, promote apoptosis in response to low levels of DNA damage. By evaluating SSCs within their stem cell niche, we show that DNA repair, cell-cycle checkpoints, and apoptosis function together to maintain the integrity of the heritable genome.",

Three TLS polymerases (Pols) function to bypass DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Rev1, Pol \u03b6, a heterodimer of the Rev3 and Rev7 proteins, and Pol \u03b7 (Rad30). Our lab has shown that S. cerevisiae Rev1 protein levels are under striking cell cycle regulation, being \u223c50-fold higher during G2/M than during G1 and much of S phase (Waters and Walker, 2006). REV1 transcript levels only vary \u223c3-fold in a similar cell cycle pattern, suggesting a posttranscriptional mechanism controls protein levels. Here, we show that the S. cerevisiae Rev1 protein is unstable during both the G1 and the G2/M phases of the cell cycle, however, the protein's half-life is shorter in G1 arrested cells than in G2/M arrested cells, indicating that the rate of proteolysis strongly contributes to Rev1's cell cycle regulation. In the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132, the steady-state levels and half-life of Rev1 increase during G1 and G2/M. Through the use of a viable proteasome mutant, we confirm that the levels of Rev1 protein are dependent on proteasome-mediated degradation. The accumulation of higher migrating forms of Rev1 under certain conditions shows that the degradation of Rev1 is possibly directed through the addition of a polyubiquitination signal or another modification. These results support a model that proteasomal degradation acts as a regulatory system of mutagenic TLS mediated by Rev1.",

     "abstract": "The ERCC1\u2013XPF structure-specific endonuclease is necessary for correct processing of homologous recombination intermediates requiring the removal of end-blocking nonhomologies. We previously showed that targeting the endogenous CHO APRT locus with plasmids designed to generate such intermediates revealed defective recombination phenotypes in ERCC1 deficient cells, including suppression of targeted insertion and vector correction recombinants and the generation of a novel class of aberrant recombinants through a deletogenic mechanism. In the present study, we examined some of the mechanistic features of ERCC1\u2013XPF in processing recombination intermediates by varying gene targeting parameters. These included altering the distance between the double-strand break (DSB) in the targeting vector and the inactivating mutation in the APRT target gene, and changing the position of the target gene mutation relative to the DSB to result in target mutations that were either upstream or downstream from the DSB. Increasing the distance from the DSB in the targeting vector to the chromosomal target gene mutation resulted in an ERCC1 dependent decrease in the efficiency of gene targeting from intermediates presenting lengthy end-blocking nonhomologies. This decrease was accompanied by a shift in the distribution of recombinant classes away from target gene conversions to targeted insertions in both wild-type and ERCC1 deficient cells, and a dramatic increase in the proportion of aberrant recombinants in ERCC1 deficient cells. Changing the position of the target gene mutation relative to the DSB in the plasmid also altered the distribution of targeted insertion subclasses recovered in wild-type cells, consistent with two-ended strand invasion followed by resolution into crossover-type products and vector integration. Our results confirm expectations from studies of Rad10\u2013Rad1 in budding yeast that ERCC1\u2013XPF activity affects conversion tract length, and provide evidence for the mechanism of generation of the novel, aberrant recombinant class first described in our previous study.",

Damage-induced Dpb11 foci are distinct from Sld3 replication initiation foci. Further, Dpb11 foci are dependent on the checkpoint proteins Mec3 (9-1-1 complex) and Rad24, and require the C-terminal domain of Dpb11. Dpb11 foci are independent of the checkpoint kinases Mec1 and Tel1, and of the checkpoint mediator Rad9. In a site-directed mutagenesis screen, we identify a separation-of-function mutant, dpb11-PF, that is sensitive to DSB-inducing agents yet remains proficient for DNA replication and the S-phase checkpoint at the permissive temperature. The dpb11-PF mutant displays altered rates of heteroallelic and direct-repeat recombination, sensitivity to DSB-inducing drugs as well as delayed kinetics of mating-type switching with a defect in the DNA synthesis step thus implicating Dpb11 in homologous recombination.

Activation of ATM/Chk2 is involved in sustaining the S phase checkpoint, and double strand break (DSB) accumulation was demonstrated. NBS1, part of the MRN complex that responds to DSBs, is known to modulate ATR- and ATM-dependent checkpoint responses to UV and IR, but a role in the response to PARP inhibition has not been addressed. Here we show that the S phase checkpoint observed 4\u20138\u00a0h after MMS\u00a0+\u00a04-AN treatment was absent in cells deficient in NBS1, but was present in NBS1-complemented (i.e., functionally wild-type) cells, indicating a critical role for NBS1 in this checkpoint response. NBS1 was phosphorylated in response to MMS\u00a0+\u00a04-AN treatment, and this was partially ATR- and ATM-dependent, suggesting involvement of both upstream kinases. NBS1 expression had little effect on ATR-mediated phosphorylation of Chk1 and ATM-mediated phosphorylation of Chk2 in response to MMS\u00a0+\u00a04-AN. Phosphorylation of SMC1 was also observed in response to MMS\u00a0+\u00a04-AN treatment. In the absence of ATM and NBS1, phosphorylation of SMC1 was weak, especially at early times after MMS\u00a0+\u00a04-AN treatment. In the absence of ATR activation, reduced SMC1 phosphorylation was seen over a 24\u00a0h time course. These results suggested that both ATR and ATM phosphorylate SMC1 in response to MMS\u00a0+\u00a04-AN and that this phosphorylation is enhanced by phospho-NBS1. The loss of the MMS\u00a0+\u00a04-AN-induced S phase checkpoint in NBS1-deficient cells may be due to a reduced cellular level of the critical downstream effector, phospho-SMC1.",

Constitutively activated NF-\u03baB is common in breast cancers, and contributes to malignant progression and therapeutic resistance. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is a key regulator of the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), and recent reports have demonstrated that ATM is required for the activation of NF-\u03baB following DNA damage. We investigated the role of ATM in the NF-\u03baB signalling cascade induced by ionising radiation (IR) in breast cancer cell lines using KU55933, a novel and specific inhibitor of ATM. KU55933 suppressed IR-induced I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, p50/p65 nuclear translocation and binding to kB consensus sequences. KU55933 also suppressed transcription of an NF-\u03baB dependent reporter gene and inhibited IR-induced DSB repair as assessed by the neutral Comet assay. KU55933 sensitised cells to IR, with a concurrent increase in caspase 3 activity. Importantly, KU55933 sensitised IKK\u03b2+/+ and p65+/+, but not IKK\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 or p65\u2212/\u2212, mouse embryonic fibroblasts to IR, despite the equivalent inhibitory effects of KU55933 on DSB repair in both the proficient and the deficient cell lines.P65 siRNA had no effect on DSB repair in either breast cancer cell line. When combined with KU55933, DSB repair was inhibited to the same extent as KU55933 alone in both breast cancer cell lines. P65 siRNA alone sensitised both cell lines to IR. A combination of p65 siRNA and KU55933 resulted in no further sensitisation compared to either one alone. Taken together these data support the hypothesis that KU55933-mediated radio-sensitisation is solely a consequence of its inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation. We conclude that radiotherapy deploying ATM inhibitors may be particularly advantageous in tumours where NF-\u03baB is constitutively activated.",

     "abstract": "Non-degradative ubiquitylation plays a crucial role in many cellular signaling pathways, including the DNA damage response. Two ubiquitin ligases, RNF8 and RNF168, in combination with the E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzyme UBC13 catalyze the formation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains at sites of DNA double-strand breaks to promote their faithful repair. However, little is known about their negative regulation. A recent study identifies a deubiquitylating enzyme, OTUB1, which counteracts RNF8/RNF168-dependent ubiquitin chain formation at break sites. Surprisingly, this enzyme carries out its function not by cleavage of polyubiquitin chains, but by targeting UBC13. This non-canonical role for a deubiquitylating enzyme has implications for the regulation of ubiquitylation not just in DNA repair, but potentially in many other cellular signaling processes.",

     "abstract": "The double-strand break (DSB) repair via homologous recombination is generally construed as a high-fidelity process. However, some molecular genetic observations show that the recombination and the recombinational DSB repair may be mutagenic and even highly mutagenic. Here we developed an effective and precise method for studying the fidelity of DSB repair in vivo by combining DSBs produced site-specifically by the SegC endonuclease with the famous advantages of the recombination analysis of bacteriophage T4 rII mutants. The method is based on the comparison of the rate of reversion of rII mutation in the presence and in the absence of a DSB repair event initiated in the proximity of the mutation. We observed that DSB repair may moderately (up to 6-fold) increase the apparent reversion frequency, the effect of being dependent on the mutation structure. We also studied the effect of the T4 recombinase deficiency (amber mutation in the uvsX gene) on the fidelity of DSB repair. We observed that DSBs are still repaired via homologous recombination in the uvsX mutants, and the apparent fidelity of this repair is higher than that seen in the wild-type background. The mutator effect of the DSB repair may look unexpected given that most of the normal DNA synthesis in bacteriophage T4 is performed via a recombination-dependent replication (RDR) pathway, which is thought to be indistinguishable from DSB repair. There are three possible explanations for the observed mutagenicity of DSB repair: (1) the origin-dependent (early) DNA replication may be more accurate than the RDR; (2) the step of replication initiation may be more mutagenic than the process of elongation; and (3) the apparent mutagenicity may just reflect some non-randomness in the pool of replicating DNA, i.e., preferential replication of the sequences already involved in replication. We discuss the DSB repair pathway in the absence of UvsX recombinase.",

     "abstract": "The base excision repair (BER) pathway coordinates the replacement of 1\u201310 nucleotides at sites of single-base lesions. This process generates DNA substrates with various gap sizes which can alter the catalytic efficiency and fidelity of a DNA polymerase during gap-filling DNA synthesis. Here, we quantitatively determined the substrate specificity and base substitution fidelity of human DNA polymerase \u03bb (Pol \u03bb), an enzyme proposed to support the known BER DNA polymerase \u03b2 (Pol \u03b2), as it filled 1\u201310-nucleotide gaps at 1-nucleotide intervals. Pol \u03bb incorporated a correct nucleotide with relatively high efficiency until the gap size exceeded 9 nucleotides. Unlike Pol \u03bb, Pol \u03b2 did not have an absolute threshold on gap size as the catalytic efficiency for a correct dNTP gradually decreased as the gap size increased from 2 to 10 nucleotides and then recovered for non-gapped DNA. Surprisingly, an increase in gap size resulted in lower polymerase fidelity for Pol \u03bb, and this downregulation of fidelity was controlled by its non-enzymatic N-terminal domains. Overall, Pol \u03bb was up to 160-fold more error-prone than Pol \u03b2, thereby suggesting Pol \u03bb would be more mutagenic during long gap-filling DNA synthesis. In addition, dCTP was the preferred misincorporation for Pol \u03bb and its N-terminal domain truncation mutants. This nucleotide preference was shown to be dependent upon the identity of the adjacent 5\u2032-template base. Our results suggested that both Pol \u03bb and Pol \u03b2 would catalyze nucleotide incorporation with the highest combination of efficiency and accuracy when the DNA substrate contains a single-nucleotide gap. Thus, Pol \u03bb, like Pol \u03b2, is better suited to catalyze gap-filling DNA synthesis during short-patch BER in vivo, although, Pol \u03bb may play a role in long-patch BER.",

Telomere shortening has been linked to cellular senescence and human aging, with oxidative stress as a major contributing factor. 7,8-Dihydro-8-oxogaunine (8-oxodG) is one of the most abundant oxidative guanine lesions, and 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) is involved in its removal. In this study, we examined if telomeric DNA is particularly susceptible to oxidative base damage and if telomere-specific factors affect the incision of oxidized guanines by OGG1. We demonstrated that telomeric TTAGGG repeats were more prone to oxidative base damage and repaired less efficiently than non-telomeric TG repeats in vivo. We also showed that the 8-oxodG-incision activity of OGG1 is similar in telomeric and non-telomeric double-stranded substrates. In addition, telomere repeat binding factors TRF1 and TRF2 do not impair OGG1 incision activity. Yet, 8-oxodG in some telomere structures (e.g., fork-opening, 3\u2032-overhang, and D-loop) were less effectively excised by OGG1, depending upon its position in these substrates. Collectively, our data indicate that the sequence context of telomere repeats and certain telomere configurations may contribute to telomere vulnerability to oxidative DNA damage processing.",

A 266\u00a0bp sequence duplication in the KanMX4 module was generated and reversions were scored via G418 resistant colonies. Both 4-NQO induced and spontaneous reversions are strictly dependent on RAD52. Damage-induced reversions are also largely dependent on RAD51. Thus, most damage-induced events require a strand invasion step. Induced reversions were not affected in rev3 mutants and partially reduced in rad30 mutants indicating an involvement of Pol \u03b7. In cells lacking Mph1, a member of the FANCM family of DNA helicases, that has been implicated in a pathway for fork reactivation involving homologous recombination, damage-induced events are significantly reduced. Together with the spontaneous mutator phenotype of mph1 mutants this data strongly suggest that Mph1 has an additional function in recombination besides its previously described ability to disrupt D-loops.

The DNA pol \u03ba was maximally activated to similar levels by a twenty-fold lower concentration of Mn2+ compared to Mg2+. In addition, the steady state analysis indicated that high fidelity DNA pol \u03ba-catalyzed N2-ethyl-Gua bypass is Mg2+-dependent. Strikingly, Mn2+ activation of DNA pol \u03ba resulted in a dramatically lower efficiency of correct nucleotide incorporation opposite both N2-ethyl-Gua and Gua compared to that detected upon Mg2+ activation. This effect is largely governed by diminished correct nucleotide binding as indicated by the high Km values for dCTP insertion opposite N2-ethyl-Gua and Gua with Mn2+ activation. A rapid kinetic analysis showed diminished burst amplitudes in the presence of Mn2+ compared to Mg2+ indicating that DNA pol \u03ba preferentially utilizes Mg2+ activation. These kinetic data support a DNA pol \u03ba wobble base pairing mechanism for dCTP incorporation opposite N2-ethyl-Gua.

NMPs were repaired with heterogeneous rates in the human mtDNA. The nearest-neighbor nucleotides significantly affected the repair rates: NMPs between pyrimidines were repaired much faster than those between purines, and those between a purine and a pyrimidine were repaired at intermediate rates. Repair intermediates of NMPs can also be detected at certain sites of the human mtDNA, indicating an ineffectiveness of processing the intermediates at these sites by the human mitochondrial BER machinery. In contrast to the human mtDNA, the yeast mtDNA did not show detectable repair of NMPs at any sites. Furthermore, a high level of spontaneous strand breaks exists exclusively at purine sites in the yeast mtDNA. Spontaneous NMPs or oxidative lesions were unlikely to be the major causes for the spontaneous strand breaks. Rather, spontaneous depurination combined with inefficient processing of DNA nicks or single-nucleotide gaps by the yeast mitochondrial BER machinery may result in the spontaneous strand breaks.

The \u03b2 and PCNA sliding clamps increase the polymerase processivity during DNA replication and are important at several stages of mismatch repair. Both MutS and MutL, the two proteins that initiate the mismatch repair response, interact with \u03b2. Binding of MutS to \u03b2 is important to recruit MutS and MutL to foci. Moreover, the endonuclease activity of human and yeast MutL\u03b1 is stimulated by PCNA. However, the concrete functions of the processivity clamp in the repair steps preceding DNA resynthesis remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of MutL encompasses a bona fide \u03b2-binding motif that mediates a weak, yet specific, interaction between the two proteins. Mutation of this conserved motif correlates with defects in mismatch repair, demonstrating that the direct interaction with \u03b2 is important for MutL function. The interaction between the C-terminal domain of MutL and \u03b2 is conserved in both Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli, but the repair defects associated with mutation of this \u03b2-binding motif are more severe in the former, suggesting that this interaction may have a more prominent role in methyl-independent than methyl-directed mismatch repair systems.

     "abstract": "Thymine deprivation results in the loss of viability in cells from bacteria to eukaryotes. Numerous studies have identified a variety of molecular processes and cellular responses associated with thymineless death (TLD). It has been observed that TLD occurs in actively growing cells, and DNA damage and DNA recombination structures have been associated with cells undergoing TLD. We measured the loss of viability in thymine-starved cells differing in the number of overlapping replication cycles (n), and we found that the magnitude of TLD correlates with the number of replication forks. By using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), we determined the proportion of linear DNA (DSBs) and the amount of DNA remaining in the well after treatment with XbaI (nmDNA) under thymine starvation in the absence or presence of both rifampicin (suppressing TLD) and hydroxyurea (maintaining TLD). Our results indicate that DSBs and nmDNA are induced by thymine starvation, but they do not correlate with the lethality observed in the presence of the drugs.We asked whether TLD was related to chromosomal DNA initiation. DNA labeling experiments and flow cytometric analyses showed that new initiation events were induced under thymine starvation. These new DNA replication initiation events were inhibited in the presence of rifampicin but not in the presence of hydroxyurea, indicating that TLD correlates with the induction of new initiation events in Escherichia coli. In support of this finding, cells carrying a deletion of the datA site, in which DNA initiation is allowed in the presence of rifampicin, underwent TLD in the presence of rifampicin. We propose that thymineless-induced DNA initiation generates a fraction of DNA damage and/or nmDNA at origins that is critical for TLD. Our model provides new elements to be considered when testing mammalian chemotherapies that are based on the inhibition of thymidylate synthetase.",

However, as previously shown in yeast as well as human cells, the introduction of a double-strand break (DSB) does not generate a chromosome break (CRB) in yeast or human cells. The transition from DSB to CRB was found to be under limited control by the tethering function of the RAD50/MRE11/XRS2 (MRX) complex. Using a system for differential fluorescent marking of both sides of an endonuclease-induced DSB in single cells, we found that nearly all DSBs are converted to CRBs in cells lacking both exonuclease 1 (EXO1) activity and MRX complex. Thus, it appears that some feature of exonuclease processing or resection at a DSB is critical for maintaining broken chromosome ends in close proximity. In addition, we discovered a thermal sensitive (cold) component to CRB formation in an MRX mutant that has implications for chromosome end mobility and/or end-processing.",

     "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are among the most cytotoxic types of DNA damage, which if left unrepaired can lead to mutations or gross chromosomal aberrations, and promote the onset of diseases associated with genomic instability such as cancer. One of the most discernible hallmarks of the cellular response to DSBs is the accumulation and local concentration of a plethora of DNA damage signaling and repair proteins in the vicinity of the lesion, initiated by ATM-mediated phosphorylation of H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX) and culminating in the generation of distinct nuclear compartments, so-called Ionizing Radiation-Induced Foci (IRIF). The assembly of proteins at the DSB-flanking chromatin occurs in a highly ordered and strictly hierarchical fashion. To a large extent, this is achieved by regulation of protein\u2013protein interactions triggered by a variety of post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, SUMOylation, and acetylation. Over the last decade, insight into the identity of proteins residing in IRIF and the molecular underpinnings of their retention at these structures has been vastly expanded. Despite such advances, however, our understanding of the biological relevance of such DNA repair foci still remains limited. In this review, we focus on recent discoveries on the mechanisms that govern the formation of IRIF, and discuss the implications of such findings in light of our understanding of the physiological importance of these structures.",

     "abstract": "Homologous recombination, the exchange of DNA strands between homologous DNA molecules, is involved in repair of many structural diverse DNA lesions. This versatility stems from multiple ways in which homologous DNA strands can be rearranged. At the core of homologous recombination are recombinase proteins such as RecA and RAD51 that mediate homology recognition and DNA strand exchange through formation of a dynamic nucleoprotein filament. Four stages in the life cycle of nucleoprotein filaments are filament nucleation, filament growth, homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange, and filament dissociation. Progression through this cycle requires a sequence of recombinase\u2013DNA and recombinase protein\u2013protein interactions coupled to ATP binding and hydrolysis. The function of recombinases is controlled by accessory proteins that allow coordination of strand exchange with other steps of homologous recombination and that tailor to the needs of specific aberrant DNA structures undergoing recombination. Accessory proteins are also able to reverse filament formation thereby guarding against inappropriate DNA rearrangements. The dynamic instability of the recombinase\u2013DNA interactions allows both positive and negative action of accessory proteins thereby ensuring that genome maintenance by homologous recombination is not only flexible and versatile, but also accurate.",

     "abstract": "DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) represent the major DNA double strand break (DSB) pathways in mammalian cells, whilst ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) lies at the core of the DSB signalling response. ATM signalling plays a major role in modifying chromatin structure in the vicinity of the DSB and increasing evidence suggests that this function influences the DSB rejoining process. DSBs have long been known to be repaired with two (or more) component kinetics. The majority (\u223c85%) of DSBs are repaired with fast kinetics in a predominantly ATM-independent manner. In contrast, \u223c15% of radiation-induced DSBs are repaired with markedly slower kinetics via a process that requires ATM and those mediator proteins, such as MDC1 or 53BP1, that accumulate at ionising radiation induced foci (IRIF). DSBs repaired with slow kinetics predominantly localise to the periphery of genomic heterochromatin (HC). Indeed, there is mounting evidence that chromatin complexity and not damage complexity confers slow DSB repair kinetics. ATM's role in HC-DSB repair involves the direct phosphorylation of KAP-1, a key HC formation factor. KAP-1 phosphorylation (pKAP-1) arises in both a pan-nuclear and a focal manner after radiation and ATM-dependent pKAP-1 is essential for DSB repair within HC regions. Mediator proteins such as 53BP1, which are also essential for HC-DSB repair, are expendable for pan-nuclear pKAP-1 whilst being essential for pKAP-1 formation at IRIF. Data suggests that the essential function of the mediator proteins is to promote the retention of activated ATM at DSBs, concentrating the phosphorylation of KAP-1 at HC DSBs. DSBs arising in G2 phase are also repaired with fast and slow kinetics but, in contrast to G0/G1 where they all DSBs are repaired by NHEJ, the slow component of DSB repair in G2 phase represents an HR process involving the Artemis endonuclease. Results suggest that whilst NHEJ repairs the majority of DSBs in G2 phase, Artemis-dependent HR uniquely repairs HC DSBs. Collectively, these recent studies highlight not only how chromatin complexity influences the factors required for DSB repair but also the pathway choice.",

Pathways of repair that require homology initiate with the resection of the 5\u2032 strand at the break site, to uncover the 3\u2032 single-stranded DNA that becomes a critical intermediate in single-strand annealing and in homologous strand exchange. Resection of the 5\u2032 strand is regulated to occur most efficiently in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle when sister chromatids are present as recombination templates.

     "abstract": "Repair and integrity of DNA ends at breaks, replication forks and telomeres are essential for life; yet, paradoxically, these responses are, in many cases, controlled by a single protein complex, Mre11\u2013Rad50\u2013Nbs1 (MRN). The MRN complex consists of dimers of each subunit and this heterohexamer controls key sensing, signaling, regulation, and effector responses to DNA double-strand breaks including ATM activation, homologous recombinational repair, microhomology-mediated end joining and, in some organisms, non-homologous end joining. We propose that this is possible because each MRN subunit can exist in three or more distinct states; thus, the trimer of MRN dimers can exist in a stunning 63 or 216 states, a number that can be expanded further when post-translational modifications are taken into account. MRN can therefore be considered as a molecular computer that effectively assesses optimal responses and pathway choice based upon its states as set by cell status and the nature of the DNA damage. This extreme multi-state concept demands a paradigm shift from striving to understand DNA damage responses in separate terms of signaling, checkpoint, and effector proteins: we must now endeavor to characterize conformational and assembly states of MRN and other DNA repair machines that couple, coordinate, and control biological outcomes. Addressing the emerging challenge of gaining a detailed molecular understanding of MRN and other multi-state dynamic DNA repair machines promises to provide opportunities to develop master keys for controlling cell biology with probable impacts on therapeutic interventions.",

Dynamic structural changes associated with a functionally important cluster of autophosphorylation sites play a significant role in regulating the dissociation of DNA-PKcs from Ku and DNA.

While G-quadruplexes interfere with DNA synthesis in vitro, the impact of G-quadruplex formation on telomeric repeat replication in human cells is not clear. We investigated the mutagenicity of telomeric repeats as a function of G-quadruplex folding opportunity and thermal stability using a shuttle vector mutagenesis assay. Since single-stranded DNA during lagging strand replication increases the opportunity for G-quadruplex folding, we tested vectors with G-rich sequences on the lagging versus the leading strand. Contrary to our prediction, vectors containing human [TTAGGG]10 repeats with a G-rich lagging strand were significantly less mutagenic than vectors with a G-rich leading strand, after replication in normal human cells. We show by UV melting experiments that G-quadruplexes from ciliates [TTGGGG]4 and [TTTTGGGG]4 are thermally more stable compared to human [TTAGGG]4. Consistent with this, replication of vectors with ciliate [TTGGGG]10 repeats yielded a 3-fold higher mutant rate compared to the human [TTAGGG]10 vectors. Furthermore, we observed significantly more mutagenic events in the ciliate repeats compared to the human repeats. Our data demonstrate that increased G-quadruplex opportunity (repeat orientation) in human telomeric repeats decreased mutagenicity, while increased thermal stability of telomeric G-quadruplexes was associated with increased mutagenicity.",

Transcription elongation factor IIS (TFIIS) has been found to localize with the TC-NER complex after cellular exposure to UV-C light and in vitro addition of TFIIS to a damage arrested RNAPII causes transcript shortening.

Here, we describe for the first time conditions that frequently cause erroneous chromosomal assemblies. Gross chromosomal rearrangements have been detected in recA mutant cells that survived exposure to 5\u00a0kGy \u03b3-radiation. The recA mutants are prone also to spontaneous DNA rearrangements during normal exponential growth. Some insertion sequences have been identified as dispersed genomic homology blocks that can mediate DNA rearrangements.

We showed here that the main reason for the lower ATM level in M059J cells was not related to the transcriptional regulation or protein degradation but was related to post-transcriptional regulation. Based on database information, we found that the 3\u2032-untranslational region (UTR) of ATM contains a miR-100 binding site.

Knocking down miR-100 promotes ATM expression in M059J cells. Up-regulating miR-100 in M059K cells and other cancer cells reduces ATM expression and sensitizes these cells to ionizing radiation.

We have determined the activities of two mutants, in which a single domain was deactivated. Inactivation of either one ATPase domain in Escherichia coli UvrA results in a complete loss of ATPase activity, indicating that both domains function in a cooperative way. We could show that this ATPase activity is not required for the recognition of bulky lesions by UvrA, but it does promote the specific binding to the less distorting cyclobutane\u2013pyrimidine dimer (CPD). The two ATPase mutants also show a difference in UvrB-loading, depending on the length of the DNA substrate. The ATPase domain I mutant was capable of loading UvrB on a lesion in a 50\u00a0bp fragment, but this loading was reduced on a longer substrate. For the ATPase domain II mutant the opposite was found: UvrB could not be loaded on a 50\u00a0bp substrate, but this loading was rescued when the length of the fragment was increased. This differential loading of UvrB by the two ATPase mutants could be related to different interactions between the UvrA and UvrB subunits.",

Pol \u03bc\u2212/\u2212 MEFs thus exhibit a robust anti-proliferative defence in response to irreparable DNA damage. These findings indicate that sub-optimal DSB repair, due to the absence of an auxiliary DNA damage repair factor, can impact on cell fitness and thereby on cell fate.",

We have now found similar resistance by the p53-null Jurkat T-cell line and by siRNA p53-knockdown normal T-cells. This evidence that ActD initiates a p53-dependent apoptotic responce prompted us to look for defective p53 accumulation by AT and NBS T-cells. Surprisingly the total p53 level was only slightly reduced compared to normal T cells but its intracellular localization was highly defective: p53 was poorly accumulated in the cytosol and nearly undetectable in mitochondria. In accordance with the dependence of ActD-induced apoptosis on a mitochondrial p53 function, in control T-cells specific inhibition of mitochondrial p53 translocation with \u03bc pifithrin reduced apoptosis by 86%, whereas treatment with \u03b1 pifithrin, which blocks p53-mediated transcription, had no effect. We also showed that nuclear export is not required for mitochondrial p53 translocation. Observation of an altered p53 ubiquitination pattern and Mdm2 accumulation in ActD-treated AT and NBS T-cells provided a mechanistic link to their defective extranuclear p53 localization.Our results disclose an undescribed defect in mitochondrial p53 accumulation in AT and NBS T-cells that makes them resistant to apoptosis following unrepairable DNA damage.",

These ATPases undergo functionally important conformational changes, including dimerization of the NH2-termini associated with ATP binding and hydrolysis. Previous studies in yeast and biochemical studies with the mammalian proteins established the importance of the MutL\u03b1 ATPase for overall MMR function. Additionally, the studies in yeast demonstrated a functional asymmetry between the contributions of the Mlh1 and Pms1 ATPase domains to MMR that was not reflected in the biochemical studies. We investigated the effect of mutating the highly conserved ATP hydrolysis and Mg2+ binding residues of MLH1 and PMS2 in mammalian cell lines. Amino acid substitutions in MLH1 intended to impact either ATP binding or hydrolysis disabled MMR, as measured by instability at microsatellite sequences, to an extent similar to MLH1-null mutation. Furthermore, cells expressing these MLH1 mutations exhibited resistance to the MMR-dependent cytotoxic effect of 6-thioguanine (6-TG). In contrast, ATP hydrolysis and binding mutants of PMS2 displayed no measurable increase in microsatellite instability or resistance to 6-TG. Our findings suggest that, in vivo, the integrity of the MLH1 ATPase domain is more critical than the PMS2 ATPase domain for normal MMR functions. These in vivo results are in contrast to results obtained previously in vitro that showed no functional asymmetry within the MutL\u03b1 ATPase, highlighting the differences between in vivo and in vitro systems.",

     "abstract": "To maintain genomic integrity cells have to respond properly to a variety of exogenous and endogenous factors that produce genome injuries and interfere with DNA replication. DNA integrity checkpoints coordinate this response by slowing cell cycle progression to provide time for the cell to repair the damage, stabilizing replication forks and stimulating DNA repair to restore the original DNA sequence and structure. In addition, there are also mechanisms of damage tolerance, such as translesion synthesis (TLS), which are important for survival after DNA damage. TLS allows replication to continue without removing the damage, but results in a higher frequency of mutagenesis. Here, we investigate the functional contribution of the Dot1 histone methyltransferase and the Rad53 checkpoint kinase to TLS regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate that the Dot1-dependent status of H3K79 methylation modulates the resistance to the alkylating agent MMS, which depends on PCNA ubiquitylation at lysine 164. Strikingkly, either the absence of DOT1, which prevents full activation of Rad53, or the expression of an HA-tagged version of RAD53, which produces low amounts of the kinase, confer increased MMS resistance. However, the dot1\u0394 rad53-HA double mutant is hypersensitive to MMS and shows barely detectable amounts of activated kinase. Furthermore, moderate overexpression of RAD53 partially suppresses the MMS resistance of dot1\u0394. In addition, we show that MMS-treated dot1\u0394 and rad53-HA cells display increased number of chromosome-associated Rev1 foci. We propose that threshold levels of Rad53 activity exquisitely modulate the tolerance to alkylating damage at least by controlling the abundance of the key TLS factor Rev1 bound to chromatin.",

     "abstract": "DNA-methylating agents of the SN2 type target DNA mostly at ring nitrogens, producing predominantly N-methylated purines. These adducts are repaired by base excision repair (BER). Since defects in BER cause accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) and sensitize cells to the agents, it has been suggested that some of the lesions on their own or BER intermediates (e.g. apurinic sites) are cytotoxic, blocking DNA replication and inducing replication-mediated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Here, we addressed the question of whether homologous recombination (HR) or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or both are involved in the repair of DSBs formed following treatment of cells with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). We show that HR defective cells (BRCA2, Rad51D and XRCC3 mutants) are dramatically more sensitive to MMS-induced DNA damage as measured by colony formation, apoptosis and chromosomal aberrations, while NHEJ defective cells (Ku80 and DNA-PKCS mutants) are only mildly sensitive to the killing, apoptosis-inducing and clastogenic effects of MMS. On the other hand, the HR mutants were almost completely refractory to the formation of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) following MMS treatment. Since DSBs are expected to be formed specifically in the S-phase, we assessed the formation and kinetics of repair of DSBs by \u03b3H2AX quantification in a cell cycle specific manner. In the cytotoxic dose range of MMS a significant amount of \u03b3H2AX foci was induced in S, but not G1- and G2-phase cells. A major fraction of \u03b3H2AX foci colocalized with 53BP1 and phosphorylated ATM, indicating they are representative of DSBs. DSB formation following MMS treatment was also demonstrated by the neutral comet assay. Repair kinetics revealed that HR mutants exhibit a significant delay in DSB repair, while NHEJ mutants completed S-phase specific DSB repair with a kinetic similar to the wildtype. Moreover, DNA-PKcs inhibition in HR mutants did not affect the repair kinetics after MMS treatment. Overall, the data indicate that agents producing N-alkylpurines in the DNA induce replication-dependent DSBs. Further, they show that HR is the major pathway of protection of cells against DSB formation, killing and genotoxicity following SN2-alkylating agents.",

We have recently shown distinct genetic dependencies for lesion bypass at and behind the replication fork in the avian cell line DT40, bypass at the fork requiring REV1 and bypass at post-replicative gaps requiring PCNA ubiquitination by RAD18. The WRN helicase/exonuclease, which is mutated in the progeroid and cancer predisposition disorder Werner's Syndrome, has previously been implicated in a RAD18-dependent DNA damage tolerance pathway. However, WRN has also been shown to be required to maintain normal replication fork progression on a damaged DNA template, a defect reminiscent of REV1-deficient cells. Here we use the avian cell line DT40 to demonstrate that WRN assists REV1-dependent translesion synthesis at the replication fork and that PCNA ubiquitination-dependent post-replicative lesion bypass provides an important backup mechanism for damage tolerance in the absence of WRN protein.",

TFAM has been previously reported to inhibit nucleotide excision repair (NER) in vitro but NER has not yet been detected in mitochondria, whereas base excision repair (BER) has been comprehensively characterized in these organelles. The BER proteins are associated with the inner membrane in mitochondria and thus with the mitochondrial nucleoid, where TFAM is also situated. However, a function for TFAM in BER has not yet been investigated. This study examines the role of TFAM in BER. In vitro studies with purified recombinant TFAM indicate that it preferentially binds to DNA containing 8-oxoguanines, but not to abasic sites, uracils, or a gap in the sequence. TFAM inhibited the in vitro incision activity of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), apurinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), and nucleotide incorporation by DNA polymerase \u03b3 (pol \u03b3). On the other hand, a DNA binding-defective TFAM mutant, L58A, showed less inhibition of BER in vitro. Characterization of TFAM knockdown (KD) cells revealed that these lysates had higher 8oxoG incision activity without changes in \u03b1OGG1 protein levels, TFAM KD cells had mild resistance to menadione and increased damage accumulation in the mtDNA when compared to the control cells. In addition, we found that the tumor suppressor p53, which has been shown to interact with and alter the DNA binding activity of TFAM, alleviates TFAM-induced inhibition of BER proteins. Together, the results suggest that TFAM modulates BER in mitochondria by virtue of its DNA binding activity and protein interactions.",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pol \u03b4 is a heterotrimeric complex composed of the catalytic subunit Pol3, the structural B subunit Pol31, and Pol32, an additional auxiliary subunit. Pol3 interacts with Pol31 thanks to its C-terminal domain (CTD) and this interaction is of functional importance both in DNA replication and DNA repair. Interestingly, deletion of the last four C-terminal Pol3 residues, LSKW, in the pol3-ct mutant does not affect DNA replication but leads to defects in homologous recombination and in break-induced replication (BIR) repair pathways. The defect associated with pol3-ct could result from a defective interaction between Pol \u03b4 and a protein involved in recombination. However, we show that the LSKW motif is required for the interaction between Pol3 C-terminal end and Pol31. This loss of interaction is relevant in vivo since we found that pol3-ct confers HU sensitivity on its own and synthetic lethality with a POL32 deletion. Moreover, pol3-ct shows genetic interactions, both suppression and synthetic lethality, with POL31 mutant alleles. Structural analyses indicate that the B subunit of Pol \u03b4 displays a major conserved region at its surface and that pol31 alleles interacting with pol3-ct, correspond to substitutions of Pol31 amino acids that are situated in this particular region. Superimposition of our Pol31 model on the 3D architecture of the phylogenetically related DNA polymerase \u03b1 (Pol \u03b1) suggests that Pol3 CTD interacts with the conserved region of Pol31, thus providing a molecular basis to understand the defects associated with pol3-ct.

DSB repair using homologous recombination is essential for the error-free repair of such breaks and proliferating cells require some level of HR activity for their viability. The BRCA1 tumour suppressor has an important role in this process and is believed to channel the DSBs into the HR pathway. The related 53BP1 gene is known to positively regulate repair of DSBs outside of S phase, but via the NHEJ pathway. Two new studies suggest a new role for 53BP1 as an inhibitor of HR [1], [2]. These genetic studies establish that 53BP1, but not other components of the NHEJ machinery, can inhibit the early resection step of HR. In cells defective for BRCA1, which is required for efficient HR, the balance between promoting and inhibiting HR is thrown towards inhibition. Simultaneous loss of 53BP1 can rescue the HR defect of BRCA1-defective cells and restore cellular viability.

     "abstract": "Both UVB radiation and DNA-breaking agents were previously reported to kill Arabidopsis stem cells. We demonstrate that death induced by UVB or by ionizing radiation (IR) requires Suppressor of Gamma Response 1 (SOG1), a transcription factor already found to govern many responses to these agents in Arabidopsis. DNA-damage responses (DDRs) triggered primarily by replication-blocking photoadducts or double-strand-breaks thus converge to a shared programmed-cell-death (PCD) pathway. Both UVB- and IR-induced PCD also require functional DDR protein kinases. Employment of atr atm mutants (uniquely available in Arabidopsis) shows that either ATR (which recognizes ssDNA) or ATM (which recognizes DSBs) suffices for PCD induction by either agent. Thus, DNA damage made by UVB or by IR engenders both ATM-activating and ATR-activating structures. The elevated PCD in UVB-irradiated atr and atm mutants suggests that in wt plants ATR and/or ATM may activate both pathways that avert PCD and those that elicit it. The similar PCD levels induced by roughly 30,000 unrepaired photoadducts vs. 20 IR-induced DSBs indicate that DDR damage-tolerance activities in this model stem-cell niche are remarkably efficient.",

The signal for TC-NER is thought to be RNA polymerase stalled at a lesion in the DNA template. In Escherichia coli, the stalled polymerase is dissociated from the lesion by the transcription repair coupling factor (Mfd protein), which also recruits excision repair proteins to the site resulting in efficient removal of the lesion. TC-NER has been documented in cells from a variety of organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. In each case, the RNA polymerase involved has been a multimeric protein complex. To ascertain whether a gene transcribed by the monomeric RNA polymerase of bacteriophage T7 could be repaired by TC-NER, we constructed strains of E. coli in which the chromosomal lacZ gene is controlled by a T7 promoter. In the absence of T7 RNA polymerase, little or no \u03b2-galactosidase is produced, indicating that the E. coli RNA polymerase does not transcribe lacZ efficiently, if at all, in these strains. By introducing a plasmid (pAR1219) carrying the T7 gene 1 under control of the E. coli lac UV5 promoter into these strains, we obtained derivatives in which the level of T7 RNA polymerase could be regulated. In cultures containing upregulated levels of the polymerase, \u03b2-galactosidase was actively produced indicating that the T7 RNA polymerase transcribes the lacZ gene efficiently. Under these conditions, we observed that UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers were removed more rapidly from the transcribed strand of lacZ than from the nontranscribed strand, supporting the conclusion that TC-NER occurred in this gene. This response was absent in an mfd-1 mutant, indicating that the underlying mechanism may be similar to that for the bacterial RNA polymerase.",

Though yeast with defects in ino80 show sensitivity to killing by a variety of DNA-damaging agents, a role for the INO80 protein complex in the repair of DNA has only been assessed for double-strand breaks, and the results are contradictory and inconclusive. We report that ino80\u0394 cells are hypersensitive to DNA base lesions induced by ultraviolet (UV) radiation and methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), but show little (or no) increased sensitivity to the DNA double-strand break (DSB)-inducing agents ionizing radiation and camptothecin.

     "abstract": "CSB protein is required for strand-specific repair of bulky DNA lesions in transcribed genes and mediates transcription recovery after exposure to DNA-damaging agents. We enzymatically generated DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs) with 3\u2032-OH and 5\u2032-phosphate termini in defined positions of a plasmid-borne gene and measured their effect on transcription in cell lines with different statuses of the Csb gene. A single SSB in the transcribed region of the gene caused significant decrease of gene expression. In all tested cell lines of mouse and human origin, a SSB in the transcribed DNA strand was less harmful for gene expression than a SSB situated in the opposing DNA strand. CSB deficiency exhibited no effect on the expression of the nicked DNA in human fibroblasts immortalised by SV40 large T-antigen but caused a very strong decrease of gene expression in spontaneously transformed mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Compared to the corresponding CSB-proficient MEFs, the effect was on average 6.7-fold stronger for a defined SSB located in the non-transcribed DNA strand, but only 2.4-fold for a SSB in the transcribed strand and 1.7-fold for a SSB located in the non-genic region. At the same time, CSB deficiency did not compromise the overall efficiency of repair of SSBs generated by treatment of the cells with hydrogen peroxide. The gene expression data thus indicate that CSB prevents irreversible transcription failures at the sites of DNA damage, acting preferentially at SSBs located in the non-transcribed DNA strand of the transcribed genes. We further conclude that SSBs in the non-transcribed DNA strand are commonly more harmful for transcription than those situated in the transcribed strand.",

     "abstract": "The XPF/MUS81 family of endonucleases is found in eukaryotes and archaea, in the former they play a critical role in DNA repair and replication fork restart. Hef is a XPF/MUS81 family member found in Euryarchaea and is related to the Fanconi anemia protein FANCM. We have studied the role of Hef in the euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii. Unlike Xpf in eukaryotes, Hef is not involved in nucleotide excision repair; instead, this function is encoded by the uvrABC genes. Similarly, deletion of hef confers only moderate sensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, whereas mutation of FANCM in leads to hypersensitivity in eukaryotes. However, Hef is essential for cell viability when the Holliday junction resolvase Hjc is absent, and both the helicase and nuclease activities of Hef are indispensable. By contrast, single mutants of hjc and hef display no significant defects in growth or homologous recombination. This suggests that Hef and Hjc are redundant for the resolution of recombination intermediates, and that Hef is the functional homolog of eukaryotic Mus81. Furthermore, deletion of hef in a recombination-deficient \u0394radA background is highly deleterious but deletion of hjc has no effect. Therefore, Hjc acts exclusively in homologous recombination whereas Hef, in addition to its role in resolving recombination intermediates, can act in a pathway that avoids the use of homologous recombination. We propose that Hef and Hjc provide alternative means to restart stalled DNA replication forks.",

     "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are carcinogens with varying potencies. These compounds are metabolized to diol epoxides that react to form DNA adducts. Nucleotide excision repair is a critical cellular defense against these bulky DNA adducts which, if not repaired, can lead to mutations and the initiation of cancer. The structural features of the PAH-adducts play a role in differential repair of these adducts by the global genomic repair subpathway of nucleotide excision repair. DNA adducts derived from the PAHs containing bay-regions are repaired more rapidly than adducts derived from PAHs containing fjord-regions. We have employed the host cell reactivation assay to examine the rate of repair of these adducts in an actively transcribing gene. The pGL3 plasmid containing a luciferase gene was damaged with diol epoxides of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P-DE), dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P-DE), benzo[g]chrysene (B[g]Ch-DE), and benzo[c]phenanthrene (B[c]Ph-DE). The plasmids were transfected into B-lymphocytes with normal repair capacity as well as lymphocytes derived from patients with the XP-A, XP-C and CS-B syndromes. We found that XPA cells were able to transcribe slowly past B[g]Ch-adducts but not the other PAHs. Using the amount of luciferase produced as a measure of DNA repair, we found that the relative rates of repair in the actively transcribing luciferase gene was B[a]P-DE\u00a0>\u00a0DB[a,l]P-DE, B[g]Ch-DE, >B[c]Ph-DE in repair proficient and XP-C cells.

     "abstract": "The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been used extensively to study responses to DNA damage. In contrast, little is known about DNA repair in this organism. C. elegans is unusual in that it encodes few DNA glycosylases and the uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) encoded by the ung-1 gene is the only known UDG. C. elegans could therefore become a valuable model organism for studies of the genetic interaction networks involving base excision repair (BER). As a first step towards characterization of BER in C. elegans, we show that the UNG-1 protein is an active uracil-DNA glycosylase. We demonstrate that an ung-1 mutant has reduced ability to repair uracil-containing DNA but that an alternative Ugi-inhibited activity is present in ung-1 nuclear extracts. Finally, we demonstrate that ung-1 mutants show altered levels of apoptotic cell corpses formed in response to DNA damaging agents. Increased apoptosis in the ung-1 mutant in response to ionizing radiation (IR) suggests that UNG-1 contributes to repair of IR-induced DNA base damage in vivo. Following treatment with paraquat however, the apoptotic corpse-formation was reduced. Gene expression profiling suggests that this phenotype is a consequence of compensatory transcriptomic shifts that modulate oxidative stress responses in the mutant and not an effect of reduced DNA damage signaling.",

     "abstract": "Available DNA mutational spectra reveal that the number of mutants with multiple mutations (\u201cmultiples\u201d) is usually greater than expected from a random distribution of mutations among mutants. These overloads imply the occurrence of non-random clusters of mutations, probably generated during episodes of low-fidelity DNA synthesis. Excess multiples have been reported not only for viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells but also for the DNA polymerases of phages T4 and RB69 in vitro. In the simplest case of a purified polymerase, non-random clusters may be generated by a subfraction of phenotypic variants able to introduce more errors per cycle of DNA synthesis than the normal enzyme. According to this hypothesis, excess multiples are not expected with non-processive polymerases even if they harbor rare mutator variants. DNA polymerase \u03b2 (Pol \u03b2) is a mammalian DNA-repair polymerase with very low processivity. Although several Pol \u03b2 mutational spectra have been described, there is conflicting evidence on whether or not excess multiples occur, with spectra based on the HSV-tk system tending to show excess multiples. Excess multiples generated by Pol \u03b2 or any of its mutants might imply that the excesses of multiples observed in numerous other systems, especially those with processive polymerases, could be artifactual. Here, the distributions of mutations generated by native and recombinant rat Pol \u03b2 and by the Pol \u03b2Y265C mutator were analyzed in the M13mp2 lacZ\u03b1 system. Our results present no evidence for a significant excess of multiples over the expected numbers with any of the Pol \u03b2 enzymes tested in this system. The reported excess of Pol \u03b2-generated multiples in the HSV-tk system may reflect a reduced efficiency of detection of base substitutions that cause weak phenotypes, which in turn may artifactually increase the frequency of multiples.",

Their origin, nature and magnitude, however, have remained elusive. We quantified these DSBs and show that a surprising 14% of replicating ribosomal DNA molecules are broken at the replication fork barrier in replicating wild-type cells. This translates into an estimated steady-state level of 7\u201310 DSBs per cell during S-phase. Importantly, breaks detectable in wild-type and sgs1 mutant cells differ from each other in terms of origin and repair. Breaks in wild-type, which were previously reported as DSBs, are likely an artefactual consequence of nicks nearby the rRFB. Sgs1 deficient cells, in which replication fork stability is compromised, reveal a class of DSBs that are detectable only in the presence of functional Dnl4. Under these conditions, Dnl4 also limits the formation of extrachromosomal ribosomal DNA circles. Consistently, dnl4 cells displayed altered fork structures at the replication fork barrier, leading us to propose an as yet unrecognized role for Dnl4 in the maintenance of ribosomal DNA stability.",

Aim of this study was to demonstrate this interaction between EGFR signalling and DNA DSB repair and to identify the underlying downstream pathways. We especially wanted to know in how far non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) as the most important DSB repair pathway is involved in this interaction. Overall DSB repair was determined by counting \u03b3H2AX foci remaining 24 after irradiation, while NHEJ activity was monitored by using a specially designed repair construct stably integrated into the genome. The overall DSB repair capacity was clearly enhanced when EGFR was activated by its natural ligand EGF and, vice versa, was reduced when EGFR was blocked either by the specific antibody Cetuximab or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib, whereby reduction was clearly stronger for erlotinib. There was also a difference in the pathways affected. While erlotinib lead to a block of both, MAPK as well as AKT signalling, Cetuximab only affected MAPK. As demonstrated by specific inhibitors (PD98059, AKTIII) EGFR interacts with DSB repair mostly via MAPK pathway. Also for NHEJ activity, there was a substantial increase, when EGFR was activated by EGF as determined for two different reporter cell lines (A549.EJ and H1299.EJ) and, vice versa, a reduction was seen when EGFR signalling was blocked by Cetuximab or erlotinib. There was, however, no difference for the two inhibitors used. This regulation of NHEJ by EGFR was only blocked when ERK was affected by siRNA but not when AKT was knocked down. These data indicate that EGFR modulates DSB repair by regulating NHEJ via MAPK signalling.",

Radiation induced DNA damage has the potential to initiate events that can lead ultimately to mutations and the onset of cancer and therefore understanding the cellular responses to DNA lesions is of particular importance. Using \u03b3H2AX as a marker for DSB formation and RAD51 as a marker of homologous recombination (HR) which is recruited in the processing of frank DSBs or DSBs arising from stalled replication forks, we have investigated the contribution of SSBs and non-DSB DNA damage to the induction of DSBs in mammalian cells by ionizing radiation during the cell cycle. V79-4 cells and human HF19 fibroblast cells have been either irradiated with 0\u201320\u00a0Gy of \u03b3 radiation or, for comparison, treated with a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide, which is known to induce SSBs but not DSBs. Inhibition of the repair of oxidative DNA lesions by poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor leads to an increase in radiation induced \u03b3H2AX and RAD51 foci which we propose is due to these lesions colliding with replication forks forming replication induced DSBs. It was confirmed that DSBs are not induced in G1 phase cells by treatment with hydrogen peroxide but treatment does lead to DSB induction, specifically in S phase cells. We therefore suggest that radiation induced SSBs and non-DSB DNA damage contribute to the formation of replication induced DSBs, detected as RAD51 foci.",

We previously reported that single-strand DNA (ssDNA) can be an important source of damage-induced LHM in yeast. Here, we establish that the generation of LHM by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) during repair of a chromosomal double-strand break (DSB) can result in over 0.2\u00a0mutations/kb, which is \u223c20,000-fold higher than the MMS-induced mutation density without a DSB. The MMS-induced mutations associated with DSB repair were primarily due to substitutions via translesion DNA synthesis at damaged cytosines, even though there are nearly 10 times more MMS-induced lesions at other bases. Based on this mutation bias, the promutagenic lesion dominating LHM is likely 3-methylcytosine, which is single-strand specific. Thus, the dramatic increase in mutagenesis at a DSB is concluded to result primarily from the generation of non-repairable lesions in ssDNA associated with DSB repair along with efficient induction of highly mutagenic ssDNA-specific lesions. These findings with MMS-induced LHM have broad biological implications for unrepaired damage generated in ssDNA and possibly ssRNA.",

We show that the depletion of PDIP38 increases the number of cells with Pol\u03b7 foci in the absence of DNA damage and diminishes cell survival after UV irradiation. In addition, PDIP38 is able to interact directly not only with Pol\u03b7 but also with the specialized polymerases Rev1 and Pol\u03b6 (via Rev7).

However, the DNA lesions producing the synergistic cell killing effect in tumors are not fully understood. Treatment of human and mouse fibroblasts with the monofunctional DNA methylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in the presence of a PARP inhibitor has been shown to trigger a cell cycle checkpoint response. Among other changes, this DNA damage response to combination treatment includes activation of ATM/Chk2 and phosphorylation of histone H2A.X. These changes are consistent with DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation during the response, but the measurement of DSBs has not been addressed. Such DSB evaluation is important in understanding this DNA damage response because events other than DSB formation are known to lead to ATM/Chk2 activation and H2A.X phosphorylation. Here, we examined the structural integrity of genomic DNA after the combined treatment of cells with MMS and a PARP inhibitor, i.e., exposure to a sub-lethal dose of MMS in the presence of the PARP inhibitor 4-amino-1,8-napthalimide (4-AN). We used pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for measurement of DSBs in both human and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and flow cytometry to follow the phosphorylated form of H2A.X (\u03b3-H2A.X). The results indicate that DSBs are formed with the combination treatment, but not following treatment with either agent alone. Our data also show that formation of \u03b3-H2A.X correlates with PARP-1-expressing cells in S-phase of the cell cycle. The observations support the model that persistence of PARP-1 at base excision repair intermediates, as cells move into S-phase, leads to DSBs and the attendant checkpoint responses.",

EM-C11 cells, deficient in XRCC1 activity, showed a 2.5-fold higher sensitivity to the toxicity of Me-lex compared to the DNA repair proficient parental CHO-9 cells, but were not hyper mutable. The spontaneous mutation spectrum at the Hprt locus generated in EM-C11 cells revealed a high percentage of genomic deletions. After Me-lex treatment, the percentage of genomic deletions did not increase, but a class of mutations which appeared to target regulatory regions of the gene significantly increased (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0277), suggesting that non-coding Hprt genomic sequences represent a strong target for the rare mutations induced by Me-lex. The number of SCEs per chromosome increased 3-fold above background in 50\u00a0\u03bc\u041c Me-lex treated CHO-9 cells, while at higher Me-lex concentrations a sharp increase in the percentage of MN and fragmented nuclei was observed.

In EM-C11, even low doses of Me-lex (25\u00a0\u03bcM) led to a significant increase in genomic damage.

To evaluate the contributions of HRR and non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) to overall DSB repair capacity throughout the cell cycle after \u03b3-irradiation, we compared HRR-deficient RAD51D-knockout 51D1 to CgRAD51D-complemented 51D1 (51D1.3) CHO cells for survival and chromosomal aberrations (CAs). Asynchronous cultures were irradiated with 150 or 300\u00a0cGy and separated by cell size using centrifugal elutriation. Cell survival of each synchronous fraction (\u223c20 fractions total from early G1 to late G2/M) was measured by colony formation. 51D1.3 cells were most resistant in S, while 51D1 cells were most resistant in early G1 (with survival and chromosome-type CA levels similar to 51D1.3) and became progressively more sensitive throughout S and G2. Both cell lines experienced significantly reduced survival from late S into G2. Metaphases were collected from every third elutriation fraction at the first post-irradiation mitosis and scored for CAs. 51D1 cells irradiated in S and G2 had \u223c2-fold higher chromatid-type CAs and a remarkable \u223c25-fold higher level of complex chromatid-type exchanges compared to 51D1.3 cells. Complex exchanges in 51D1.3 cells were only observed in G2. These results show an essential role for HRR in preventing gross chromosomal rearrangements in proliferating cells and, with our previous report of reduced survival of G2-phase NHEJ-deficient prkdc CHO cells [Hinz et al., DNA Repair 4, 782\u2013792, 2005], imply reduced activity/efficiency of both HRR and NHEJ as cells transition from S to G2.",

     "abstract": "Bulky cisplatin lesions are repaired primarily by nucleotide excision repair (NER), in which the structure specific endonuclease XPF\u2013ERCC1 is a critical component. It is now known that the XPF\u2013ERCC1 complex has repair functions beyond NER and plays a role in homologous recombination (HR). It has been suggested that expression of ERCC1 correlates with cisplatin drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In our study, using NSCLC, ovarian, and breast cancer cells, we show that the XPF\u2013ERCC1 complex is a valid target to increase cisplatin cytotoxicity and efficacy. We targeted XPF\u2013ERCC1 complex by RNA interference and assessed the repair capacity of cisplatin intrastrand and interstrand crosslinks by ELISA and alkaline comet assay, respectively. We also assessed the repair of cisplatin-ICL-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs) by monitoring \u03b3-H2AX focus formation. Interestingly, XPF protein levels were significantly reduced following ERCC1 downregulation, but the converse was not observed. The transcript levels were unaffected suggesting that XPF protein stability is likely affected. The repair of both types of cisplatin-DNA lesions was decreased with downregulation of XPF, ERCC1 or both XPF\u2013ERCC1. The ICL-induced DSBs persist in the absence of XPF\u2013ERCC1. The suppression of the XPF\u2013ERCC1 complex significantly decreases the cellular viability which correlates well with the decrease in DNA repair capacity. A double knockdown of XPF\u2013ERCC1 displays the greatest level of cellular cytotoxicity when compared with XPF or ERCC1 alone. The difference in cytotoxicity observed is likely due to the level of total protein complex remaining. These data demonstrate that XPF\u2013ERCC1 is a valid target to enhance cisplatin efficacy in cancer cells by affecting cisplatin-DNA repair pathways.",

     "abstract": "The autosomal recessive disorder Xeroderma pigmentosum-variant (XPV) is characterized (i) at the cellular level by dramatic hypermutability and defective recovery of DNA synthesis following UV exposure, and (ii) clinically by abnormal sunlight sensitivity and remarkable predisposition to skin cancer. These phenotypes are clearly attributable to germline mutations in POLH, encoding DNA polymerase eta (pol\u03b7) normally required for accurate translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) past UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Here we demonstrate that patient-derived XPV-skin fibroblasts exposed to 15\u00a0J/m2 of UV also exhibit (in addition to abnormal TLS) a significant defect in global-genomic nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER) exclusively during S phase. This cell cycle-specific GG-NER defect can be complemented by ectopic expression of wild-type pol\u03b7, but not of pol\u03b7 variants deficient in either nuclear relocalization or PCNA interaction. We highlight a previous study from our laboratory demonstrating that UV-exposed, ATR-deficient Seckel syndrome fibroblasts, like XPV fibroblasts, manifest strong attenuation of GG-NER uniquely in S phase populations. We now present further evidence suggesting that deficient S phase repair can be rescued in both XPV- and Seckel syndrome-cells if the formation of blocked replication forks post-UV is either prevented or substantially reduced, i.e., following, respectively, pharmacological inhibition of DNA synthesis prior to UV irradiation, or exposure to a relatively low UV dose (5\u00a0J/m2). Our findings in cultured cells permit speculation that abrogation of GG-NER during S phase might partially contribute (in a synergistic manner with defective, atypically error-prone TLS) to the extreme state of UV-hypermutability leading to accelerated skin cancer development in XPV patients. Moreover, based on the overall data, we postulate that loss of either functional pol\u03b7 or -ATR engenders abnormal persistence of stalled replication forks at UV-adducted sites in DNA which, in turn, can actively and/or passively trigger GG-NER inhibition.",

We examined the ability of WRN to rescue DNA damage sensitivity of a yeast mutant defective in the Rad50 subunit of Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 nuclease complex implicated in homologous recombination repair. Genetic studies revealed WRN operates in a yEXO1-dependent pathway to rescue rad50 sensitivity to methylmethane sulfonate (MMS). WRN helicase, but not exonuclease, is required for MMS resistance. WRN missense mutations in helicase or RecQ C-terminal domains interfered with the ability of WRN to rescue rad50 MMS sensitivity. WRN does not rescue rad50 ionizing radiation (IR) sensitivity, suggesting that WRN, in collaboration with yEXO1, is tailored to relieve replicational stress imposed by alkylated base damage. WRN and yEXO1 are associated with each other in vivo. Purified WRN stimulates hEXO1 nuclease activity on DNA substrates associated with a stalled or regressed replication fork. We propose WRN helicase operates in an EXO1-dependent pathway to help cells survive replicational stress. In contrast to WRN, BLM helicase defective in Bloom's syndrome failed to rescue rad50 MMS sensitivity, but partially restored IR resistance, suggesting a delineation of function by the human RecQ helicases.",

We have investigated whether a ubiquitin-PCNA fusion can mimic ubiquitinated PCNA, by transforming plasmids expressing this fusion protein into different mutants of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We show that the fusion protein is able to form PCNA trimers and that it can reduce the UV sensitivity and increase translesion synthesis in mutants in which PCNA cannot be ubiquitinated (pcn1-K164R and rhp18), but not of the rad8 mutant in which PCNA can be mono-ubiquitinated but not poly-ubiquitinated. We conclude that the fusion protein is a mimic of mono-ubiquitinated PCNA but it cannot be poly-ubiquitinated. Expression of the fusion protein at levels similar to that of endogenous unmodified protein has little effect on the spontaneous mutation rate of S. pombe. Replacement of the pcn1 locus with PCNA N-terminally tagged with different epitopes resulted in lethality, probably because the tagged proteins were expressed at substantially reduced levels.",

Using pull-down experiments we demonstrate that UNG2 directly interacts with the nuclear localization signal-region (NLS) of XRCC1. Western blot and functional analysis of immunoprecipitates from whole cell extracts prepared from S-phase enriched cells demonstrate the presence of XRCC1 complexes that contain UNG2 in addition to separate XRCC1 and UNG2 associated complexes with distinct repair features. XRCC1 complexes performed complete repair of uracil with higher efficacy than UNG2 complexes.

Here we tested the helicase activity of purified human RecQ4 on various substrates. Consistent with recent results, we detected ATP-dependent RecQ4 unwinding of forked duplexes. However, our results provide the first evidence that human RecQ4's unwinding is independent of strand annealing, and that it does not require the presence of excess ssDNA. Moreover, we demonstrate that a point mutation of the conserved lysine in the Walker A motif abolished helicase activity, implying that not the N-terminal portion, but the helicase domain is solely responsible for the enzyme's unwinding activity. In addition, we demonstrate a novel stimulation of RecQ4's helicase activity by replication protein A, similar to that of RecQ1, BLM, WRN, and RecQ5.

     "abstract": "Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is the only mechanism in humans to repair UV-induced DNA lesions such as pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone photoproducts and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). In response to UV damage, the ataxia telangiectasia mutated and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase phosphorylates and activates several downstream effector proteins, such as p53 and XPA, to arrest cell cycle progression, stimulate DNA repair, or initiate apoptosis. However, following the completion of DNA repair, there must be active mechanisms that restore the cell to a prestressed homeostatic state. An important part of this recovery must include a process to reduce p53 and NER activity as well as to remove repair protein complexes from the DNA damage sites. Since activation of the damage response occurs in part through phosphorylation, phosphatases are obvious candidates as homeostatic regulators of the DNA damage and repair responses. Therefore, we investigated whether the serine/threonine wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1/PPM1D) might regulate NER. WIP1 overexpression inhibits the kinetics of NER and CPD repair, whereas WIP1 depletion enhances NER kinetics and CPD repair. This NER suppression is dependent on WIP1 phosphatase activity, as phosphatase-dead WIP1 mutants failed to inhibit NER. Moreover, WIP1 suppresses the kinetics of UV-induced damage repair largely through effects on NER, as XPD-deficient cells are not further suppressed in repairing UV damage by overexpressed WIP1. Wip1 null mice quickly repair their CPD and undergo less UV-induced apoptosis than their wild-type counterparts. In vitro phosphatase assays identify XPA and XPC as two potential WIP1 targets in the NER pathway. Thus WIP1 may suppress NER kinetics by dephosphorylating and inactivating XPA and XPC and other NER proteins and regulators after UV-induced DNA damage is repaired.",

The majority of XRCC1 has previously been demonstrated to exist in a phosphorylated form and cells containing mutant XRCC1, that is unable to be phosphorylated, display a reduced rate of single strand break repair. Here, in an unbiased assay, we demonstrate that the cytoplasmic form of the casein kinase 2 (CK2) protein is the major protein kinase activity involved in phosphorylation of XRCC1 in human cell extracts and that XRCC1 phosphorylation is required for XRCC1-Lig III complex stability. We demonstrate that XRCC1-Lig III complex containing mutant XRCC1, in which CK2 phosphorylation sites have been mutated, is unstable. We also find that a knockdown of CK2 by siRNA results in both reduced XRCC1 phosphorylation and stability, which also leads to a reduced amount of Lig III and accumulation of DNA strand breaks.

To verify the suitability of combining DRAQ5-staining with protein dynamic measurements, we have tested the cellular consequences of DRAQ5 DNA intercalation. We show that DRAQ5 intercalation rapidly modifies both the localization and the mobility properties of several DNA-binding proteins such as histones, DNA repair, replication and transcription factors, by stimulating a release of these proteins from their substrate. Most importantly, the effect of DRAQ5 on the mobility of essential cellular enzymes results in a potent inhibition of the corresponding cellular functions.

     "abstract": "The maintenance of genetic stability is of crucial importance for any form of life. Prior to cell division in each mammalian cell, the process of DNA replication must faithfully duplicate the three billion bases with an absolute minimum of mistakes. Various environmental and endogenous agents, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), can modify the structural properties of DNA bases and thus damage the DNA. Upon exposure of cells to oxidative stress, an often generated and highly mutagenic DNA damage is 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (8-oxo-G). The estimated steady-state level of 8-oxo-G lesions is about 103 per cell/per day in normal tissues and up to 105 lesions per cell/per day in cancer tissues. The presence of 8-oxo-G on the replicating strand leads to frequent (10\u201375%) misincorporations of adenine opposite the lesion (formation of A:8-oxo-G mispairs), subsequently resulting in C:G to A:T transversion mutations. These mutations are among the most predominant somatic mutations in lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and colorectal cancers. Thus, in order to reduce the mutational burden of ROS, human cells have evolved base excision repair (BER) pathways ensuring (i) the correct and efficient repair of A:8-oxo-G mispairs and (ii) the removal of 8-oxo-G lesions from the genome. Very recently it was shown that MutY glycosylase homologue (MUTYH) and DNA polymerase \u03bb play a crucial role in the accurate repair of A:8-oxo-G mispairs. Here we review the importance of accurate BER of 8-oxo-G damage and its regulation in prevention of cancer.",

Surprisingly, there was little difference in sensitivities of wildtype cells and mutants defective in homologous recombination, nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), or both pathways. Physical analysis using standard and pulsed field gel electrophoresis demonstrated time-dependent breakage of chromosomal DNA within cells. Although ionizing radiation-induced DSBs were largely repaired within 4\u00a0h, no repair of PvuII-induced breaks could be detected in diploid cells, even after arrest in G2/M. Rare survivors of PvuII expression had an increased frequency of chromosome XII deletions, an indication that a fraction of the induced DSBs could be repaired by an error-prone process. These results indicate that, unlike DSBs with complementary single-stranded DNA overhangs, blunt-ended DSBs in yeast chromosomes are poor substrates for repair by either NHEJ or recombination.",

     "abstract": "The cell cycle inhibitor p21CDKN1A has been shown to participate in nucleotide excision repair by interacting with PCNA. Here we have investigated whether p21 plays a role in base excision repair (BER), by analyzing p21 interactions with BER factors, and by assessing the response of p21\u2212/\u2212 human fibroblasts to DNA damage induced by alkylating agents. Absence of p21 protein resulted in a higher sensitivity to alkylation-induced DNA damage, as indicated by reduced clonogenic efficiency, defective DNA repair (assessed by the comet test), and by persistence of histone H2AX phosphorylation. To elucidate the mechanisms at the basis of the function of p21 in BER, we focused on its interaction with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an important player in this repair process. p21 was found to bind the automodification/DNA binding domain of PARP-1, although some interaction occurred also with the catalytic domain after DNA damage. This association was necessary to regulate PARP-1 activity since poly(ADP-ribosylation) induced by DNA damage was higher in p21\u2212/\u2212 human fibroblasts than in parental p21+/+ cells, and in primary fibroblasts after p21 knock-down by RNA interference. Concomitantly, recruitment of PARP-1 and PCNA to damaged DNA was greater in p21\u2212/\u2212 than in p21+/+ fibroblasts. This accumulation resulted in persistent interaction of PARP-1 with BER factors, such as XRCC1 and DNA polymerase \u03b2, suggesting that prolonged association reduced the DNA repair efficiency. These results indicate that p21 regulates the interaction between PARP-1 and BER factors, to promote efficient DNA repair.",

Furthermore, our previous work demonstrating functional interaction of NEIL1 with PCNA and flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) suggested its involvement in replication-associated repair. Here we show interaction of NEIL1 with replication protein A (RPA), the heterotrimeric single-strand DNA binding protein that is essential for replication and other DNA transactions. The NEIL1 immunocomplex isolated from human cells contains RPA, and its abundance in the complex increases after exposure to oxidative stress. NEIL1 directly interacts with the large subunit of RPA (Kd \u223c20\u00a0nM) via the common interacting interface (residues 312\u2013349) in NEIL1's disordered C-terminal region. RPA inhibits the base excision activity of both wild-type NEIL1 (389 residues) and its C-terminal deletion C\u039478 mutant (lacking the interaction domain) for repairing 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU) in a primer-template structure mimicking the DNA replication fork. This inhibition is reduced when the damage is located near the primer-template junction. Contrarily, RPA moderately stimulates wild-type NEIL1 but not the C\u039478 mutant when 5-OHU is located within the duplex region. While NEIL1 is inhibited by both RPA and Escherichia coli single-strand DNA binding protein, only inhibition by RPA is relieved by PCNA. These results showing modulation of NEIL1's activity on single-stranded DNA substrate by RPA and PCNA support NEIL1's involvement in repairing the replicating genome.",

Now, in an attempt to generate a model for UV-induced melanoma, we have used the floxed Ercc1 allele in combination with a Cre transgene under the control of the tyrosinase gene promoter to produce mice with Ercc1-deficient melanocytes that are hypersensitive to UV irradiation. These animals developed normally, but died when 4\u20136 months old with severe colonic obstruction. Melanocytes are derived from the neural crest and the tyrosinase promoter is also expressed in additional neural crest-derived lineages, including the progenitors of the parasympathetic nervous system that innervates the gastrointestinal tract and controls gut peristalsis. A functional enteric nervous system developed in floxed Ercc1 mice with the tyrosinase Cre transgene, but was found to have degenerated in the colons of affected mice.

     "publication date": "06-2010",
     "abstract": "Mitotic homologous recombination is utilised to repair DNA breaks using either sister chromatids or homologous chromosomes as templates. Because sister chromatids are identical, exchanges between sister chromatids have no consequences for the maintenance of genomic integrity unless they involve repetitive DNA sequences. Conversely, homologous chromosomes might differ in genetic content, and exchanges between homologues might lead to loss of heterozygosity and subsequent inactivation of functional genes. Genomic instability, caused by unscheduled recombination events between homologous chromosomes, is enhanced in the absence of RecQ DNA helicases, as observed in Bloom's cancer-prone syndrome. Here, we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis to analyse budding yeast diploid cells that were modified to distinguish replication intermediates originating from each homologous chromosome. Therefore, these cells were suitable for analysing the formation of inter-homologue junctions. We found that Rad51-dependent DNA structures resembling inter-homologue junctions accumulate together with sister chromatid junctions at damaged DNA replication forks in recQ mutants, but not in the absence of Srs2 or Mph1 DNA recombination helicases. Inter-homologue joint molecules in recQ mutants are less abundant than sister chromatid junctions, but they accumulate with similar kinetics after origin firing under conditions of DNA damage. We propose that unscheduled accumulation of inter-homologue junctions during DNA replication might account for allelic recombination defects in recQ mutants.",

In vitro, both DNA-PK independent 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 exonuclease activities and DNA-PK dependent endonuclease activity have been attributed to Artemis, though mutational analysis of the Artemis active site only disrupts endonuclease activity. This suggests that either the enzyme contains two different active sites, or the exonuclease activity is not intrinsic to the Artemis polypeptide. To distinguish between these possibilities, we sought to determine if it was possible to biochemically separate Artemis endonuclease activity from exonuclease activity. Recombinant [His]6-Artemis was expressed in a Baculovirus insect-cell expression system and isolated using a three-column purification methodology. Exonuclease and endonuclease activities, the ability to be phosphorylated by DNA-PK, and Artemis antibody reactivity was monitored throughout the purification and to characterize final pools of protein preparation. Results demonstrated the co-elution of exonuclease and endonuclease activities on a Ni\u2013agarose affinity column but separation of the two enzymatic activities upon fractionation on a hydroxyapatite column. An exonuclease-free fraction of Artemis was obtained that retained DNA-PK dependent endonuclease activity, was phosphorylated by DNA-PK and reacted with an Artemis specific antibody.

We and others have identified several cell cycle checkpoint and DNA repair proteins that influence common fragile site stability. However, the initial events underlying fragile site breakage remain poorly understood. We demonstrate here that aphidicolin-induced gaps and breaks at fragile sites are prevented when cells are co-treated with low concentrations of the topoisomerase I inhibitor, camptothecin. This reduction in breakage is accompanied by a reduction in aphidicolin-induced RPA foci, CHK1 and RPA2 phosphorylation, and PCNA monoubiquitination, indicative of reduced levels of single stranded DNA. Furthermore, camptothecin reduces spontaneous fragile site breakage seen in cells lacking ATR, even in the absence of aphidicolin. These data from cultured human cells demonstrate that topoisomerase I activity is required for DNA common fragile site breaks and suggest that polymerase\u2013helicase uncoupling is a key initial event in this process.",

To gain insight into which DNA lesions are substrates for Aprataxin action in vivo, we deleted the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HNT3 gene, which encodes the Aprataxin homolog, in combination with known DNA repair genes. While hnt3\u0394 single mutants were not sensitive to DNA damaging agents, loss of HNT3 caused synergistic sensitivity to H2O2 in backgrounds that accumulate strand breaks with blocked termini, including apn1\u0394 apn2\u0394 tpp1\u0394 and ntg1\u0394 ntg2\u0394 ogg1\u0394.

Loss of HNT3 also increased the sister chromatid exchange frequency. Surprisingly, HNT3 deletion partially rescued H2O2 sensitivity in recombination-deficient rad51\u0394 and rad52\u0394 cells, suggesting that Hnt3 promotes formation of a repair intermediate that is resolved by recombination.",

Following expression and purification of human proteins from a bacterial system, we investigated MUTYH incision capacity on an 8-oxoG:A substrate by standard glycosylase assays. For the first time, we employed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology for real-time recording of the association/dissociation of wild-type and MUTYH variants from an 8-oxoG:A DNA substrate. When compared to the wild-type protein, R171W, E466del and Y165C variants showed a severe reduction in the binding affinity towards the substrate, while 137insIW and G382D mutants manifested only a slight decrease mainly due to a slower rate of association. This reduced binding was always associated with impairment of glycosylase activity, with adenine removal being totally abrogated in R171W, E466del and Y165C and only partially reduced in 137insIW and G382D.

Consistent with previous reports of Fbh1-deficiency in vertebrate cells, we found that Fbh1\u2212/\u2212 cells show a moderate increase in Rad51 localization to DNA damage, but no clear defect in chromosome break repair. In contrast, we found that Fbh1f/f cells show a decrease in Rad51 localization to DNA damage and increased cytoplasmic localization of Rad51. However, these Fbh1f/f cells show no clear defects in chromosome break repair. Since some Rad51 partners and F-box-associated proteins (Skp1-Cul1) have been implicated in progression through mitosis, we considered whether Fbh1 might play a role in this process. To test this hypothesis, we disrupted mitosis using catalytic topoisomerase II inhibitors (bisdioxopiperazines), which inhibit chromosome decatenation. We found that both Fbh1f/f and Fbh1\u2212/\u2212 cells show hypersensitivity to topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitors, even though the degree of decatenation stress was not affected. Furthermore, following topoisomerase II catalytic inhibition, both Fbh1-deficient cell lines show substantial defects in anaphase separation of chromosomes. These results indicate that Fbh1 is important for restoration of normal mitotic progression following decatenation stress.",

Slx4 is phosphorylated by the Mec1 and Tel1 kinases after DNA damage on at least six Ser/Thr residues, and mutation of all six residues to Ala reduces the efficiency of SSA.

Slx4 became phosphorylated after induction of a single double-strand break (DSB) during SSA and dephosphorylation coincided approximately with completion of repair.

Studies on sbcCD mutation in Deinococcus showed nearly a 100-fold increase in gamma radiation sensitivity as compared to wild type. The mutant showed a higher rate of in vivo DNA degradation during the post-irradiation recovery period that corresponds to the RecA-dependent DSB repair phase. These cells showed a typical NotI pattern of DNA reassembly during the early phase of DSB repair, but were defective for the subsequent RecA-dependent phase II of DSB repair. Hydrogen peroxide had no effect on cell survival of the mutant. While its tolerance to higher doses of UVC and mitomycin C was significantly decreased as compared to wild type.

By ENDOR spectroscopy, the local environment of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor is probed by virtue of proton hyperfine couplings that report on the electron-spin density at the positions of magnetic nuclei. Despite the amino-acid sequence dissimilarity as compared to class I enzymes, the results indicate similar binding motifs for FAD in the class II photolyases. Furthermore, the photoreduction kinetics starting from the FAD cofactor in the fully oxidized redox state, FADox, have been probed by UV/Vis spectroscopy. In Escherichia coli (class I) CPD photolyase, light-induced generation of FADH from FADox, and subsequently FADH\u2212 from FADH, proceeds in a step-wise fashion via a chain of tryptophan residues. These tryptophans are well conserved among the sequences and within all known structures of class I photolyases, but completely lacking from the equivalent positions of class II photolyase sequences. Nevertheless, class II photolyases show photoreduction kinetics similar to those of the class I enzymes. We propose that a different, but also effective, electron-transfer cascade is conserved among the class II photolyases. The existence of such electron transfer pathways is supported by the observation that the catalytically active fully reduced flavin state obtained by photoreduction is maintained even under oxidative conditions in all three classes of enzymes studied in this contribution.",

Several RAD51-like proteins, including XRCC2, appear to help with this process, but their roles are not well understood. Here we show that XRCC2 is highly conserved and that most substantial truncations of the protein destroy its ability to function. XRCC2 and its partner protein RAD51L3 are found to interact with RAD51 in the 2-hybrid system, and XRCC2 is shown to be important but not essential for the accumulation of RAD51 at the sites of DNA damage. We visualize the localization of XRCC2 protein at the same sites of DNA damage for the first time using specialized irradiation conditions. Our data indicate that an important function of XRCC2 is to enhance the activity of RAD51, so that the loss of XRCC2 results in a severe delay in the early response of RAD51 to DNA damage.",

In eukaryotes, GT recruits enzymes from the HR-mediated double strand break repair pathway. Different mechanisms of HR have been described which depend on the Rad52 epistasis group of genes, but which specific mechanism is used by the cell for GT remains unclear. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the RAD52 protein is essential for GT, and the RAD51 protein plays a minor role. In filamentous fungi and animal cells, however, GT depends on RAD51 and is weakly affected by suppression of RAD52. Genetic evidence also indicates that the non-homologous end-joining pathway of DSB repair has a negative impact on GT efficiencies, but how the balance between these two pathways is controlled is poorly understood. Here, we have examined the role of RAD51 in the only plant that exhibits high GT frequencies, the model bryophyte Physcomitrella patens. Our results show that the two RAD51 proteins have partially redundant functions in the maintenance of genome integrity and resistance to ionizing radiation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that loss of function of the two RAD51 proteins completely abolishes GT and strongly increases illegitimate integration rates in this moss. These findings demonstrate for the first time in plant the critical role of RAD51 in controlling the balance between targeted and random integration events observed upon transgenesis, and confirm that P. patens is a particularly interesting tool for studying GT in higher eukaryotes.",

Fibroblasts and lymphocytes of BS patients also exhibit increased mutation frequency at the X-linked reporter gene HPRT, suggesting that BLM also plays a role in preventing small scale genomic rearrangements. However, the nature of such small scale alterations has not been well characterized. Here we report the characterization of Hprt mutations in vivo in Blm hypomorphic mice, Blmtm1Ches/Blmtm3Brd. We found that the frequency of Hprt mutants was increased about 6-fold in the Blmtm1Ches/Blmtm3Brd mice when compared to Blmtm3Brd heterozygous mice or wildtype mice. Molecular characterization of Hprt gene in the mutant clones indicates that many of the mutations were caused by deletions that range from several base pairs to several thousand base pairs. While deletions in BLM-proficient somatic cells are often shown to be mediated by direct repeats, all three deletion junctions in Hprt of Blmtm1Ches/Blmtm3Brd mice were flanked by inverted repeats, suggesting that secondary structures formed during DNA replication, when resolved improperly, may lead to deletions. In addition, single base pair substitution and insertion/deletion were also detected in the mutant clones. Taken together, our results indicated that BLM function is important in preventing small scale genetic alterations. Thus, both large scale and small scale genetic alterations are elevated when BLM is reduced, which may contribute to loss of function of tumor suppressor genes and subsequent tumorigenesis.",

We hypothesize that MGMT polymorphisms are associated with risk of SCCHN. In a hospital-based case\u2013control study of 721 patients with SCCHN and 1234 cancer-free controls frequency-matched by age, sex and ethnicity, we genotyped four MGMT polymorphisms, two in exon 3, 16195C\u00a0>\u00a0T and 16286C\u00a0>\u00a0T and two in the promoter region, 45996G\u00a0>\u00a0T and 46346C\u00a0>\u00a0A. We found that none of these polymorphisms alone had a significant effect on risk of SCCHN. However, when these four polymorphisms were evaluated together by the number of putative risk genotypes (i.e. 16195CC, 16286CC, 45996GT\u00a0+\u00a0TT, and 46346CA\u00a0+\u00a0AA), a statistically significantly increased risk of SCCHN was associated with the combined genotypes with three to four risk genotypes, compared with those with zero to two risk genotypes (adjusted odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.27; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u20131.53). This increased risk was also more pronounced among young subjects (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.81; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.11\u20132.96), men (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.24; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.00\u20131.55), ever smokers (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.25; 95%\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u20131.56), ever drinkers (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.29; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04\u20131.60), patients with oropharyngeal cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.45; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.12\u20131.87), and oropharyngeal cancer with regional lymph node metastasis (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.52; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.16\u20131.89).

Consistently, expression of AtRAD51 and AtDMC1 induced the SOS response in bacteria, even affecting E. coli viability. 100 SOS-inducing cDNAs were isolated from a cDNA library constructed from an Arabidopsis cell suspension that was found to highly express meiotic genes. A large proportion of these SOS+ candidates are clearly related to the DNA metabolism, others could be involved in the RNA metabolism, while the remaining cDNAs encode either totally unknown proteins or proteins that were considered as irrelevant. Seven SOS+ candidate genes are induced following gamma irradiation. The in planta function of several of the SOS-inducing clones was investigated using T-DNA insertional mutants or RNA interference. Only one SOS+ candidate, among those examined, exhibited a defined phenotype: silenced plants for DUT1 were sensitive to 5-fluoro-uracil (5FU), as is the case of the leaky dut-1 mutant in E. coli that are affected in dUTPase activity. dUTPase is essential to prevent uracil incorporation in the course of DNA replication.",

Guided by the structures of the A3G carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain (A3G-CTD), we identified two potential regions (region 1 and region 2) that may interact with DNA and swapped the corresponding regions between a variant of A3G-CTD and AID. The resulting hybrids were expressed in Escherichia coli and two different genetic assays and a biochemical assay were used to determine the sequence selectivity of the hybrids in promoting C to T mutations. The results show that while the 10 amino acid region 2 of A3G was its principal sequence-specificity determinant, region 1 of A3G enhanced the target cytosine preference conferred by region 2. In contrast, neither of the two regions in AID individually or in combination were sufficient to confer the DNA sequence preference of this protein upon A3G. Instead, introduction of AID sequences in A3G relaxed the sequence-specificity of the latter protein. Our results show that the sequence selectivity of APOBEC family of enzymes is determined by at least two separate sequence segments and there may be additional regions of the protein involved in DNA sequence recognition.",

Compelling evidences have demonstrated the existence of converging signals that negatively regulate p21 bellow basal levels when replication forks are blocked. Moreover, conclusive reports identified the E3-ligase CRL4CDT2 (CUL4\u2013DDB1\u2013CDT2) as the enzymatic complex that promotes p21 proteolysis when treatments such as UV irradiation trigger replication fork stress. A pre-requisite for CRL4CDT2-driven proteolysis is the interaction of p21 with PCNA. Interestingly as well, CRL4CDT2-dependent proteolysis is not limited to p21 and affects other PCNA partners, including the specialized DNA polymerase \u03b7 (pol eta). These recent discoveries are particularly intriguing since the UV-induced degradation of p21 has been shown to be required for efficient pol \u03b7 recruitment to DNA lesions. Herein we review the findings that lead to the identification of the molecular mechanism that triggers damage-induced PCNA-coupled protein proteolysis. We propose a novel model in which CRL4CDT2-dependent protein degradation facilitates a sequential and dynamic exchange between PIP box bearing proteins at stall forks during Translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). Moreover, given the tight spatiotemporal control that CRL4CDT2-driven proteolysis is able to confer to PCNA-regulated processes, we discuss the impact that this degradation mechanism might have in other molecular switches associated with the repair of damaged DNA.",

     "abstract": "The class III histone deacetylase (HDAC) SIRT1 plays a role in the metabolism, aging, and carcinogenesis of organisms and regulates senescence and apoptosis in cells. Recent reports revealed that SIRT1 also deacetylates several DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair proteins. However, its exact functions in DNA repair remained elusive. Using nuclear foci analysis and fluorescence-based, chromosomal DSB repair reporter, we find that SIRT1 activity promotes homologous recombination (HR) in human cells. Importantly, this effect is unrelated to functions of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), another NAD(+)-catabolic protein, and does not correlate with cell cycle changes or apoptosis. Interestingly, we demonstrate that inactivation of Rad51 does not eliminate the effect of SIRT1 on HR. By epistasis-like analysis through knockdown and use of mutant cells of distinct SIRT1 target proteins, we show that the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factor Ku70 as well as the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome protein (nibrin) are not needed for this SIRT1-mediated effect, even though a partial contribution of nibrin cannot be excluded.

These results provide first evidence that links SIRT1's functions to HR with possible implications for genomic stability during aging and tumorigenesis.",

     "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, multiple DNA repair mechanisms respond to a wide variety of DNA lesions. Homologous recombination-dependent repair provides a pathway for dealing with DNA double-strand breaks and replication fork demise. A key step in this process is the resolution of recombination intermediates such as Holliday junctions (HJs). Recently, nucleases from yeast (Yen1) and human cells (GEN1) were identified that can resolve HJ intermediates, in a manner analogous to the E. coli HJ resolvase RuvC. Here, we have analyzed the role of Yen1 in DNA repair in S. cerevisiae, and show that while yen1\u0394 mutants are repair-proficient, yen1\u0394 mus81\u0394 double mutants are exquisitely sensitive to a variety of DNA-damaging agents that disturb replication fork progression. This phenotype is dependent upon RAD52, indicating that toxic recombination intermediates accumulate in the absence of Yen1 and Mus81. After MMS treatment, yen1\u0394 mus81\u0394 double mutants arrest with a G2 DNA content and unsegregated chromosomes. These findings indicate that Yen1 can act upon recombination/repair intermediates that arise in MUS81-defective cells following replication fork damage.",

     "abstract": "Maintenance of genomic stability is critical for all cells. Homologous recombination (HR) pathways promote genome stability using evolutionarily conserved proteins such as RecA, SSB, and RecQ, the Escherichia coli homologue of five human proteins at least three of which suppress genome instability and cancer. A previous report indicated that RecQ promotes the net accumulation in cells of intermolecular HR intermediates (IRIs), a net effect opposite that of the yeast and two human RecQ homologues. Here we extend those conclusions. We demonstrate that cells that lack both UvrD, an inhibitor of RecA-mediated strand exchange, and RecG, a DNA helicase implicated in IRI resolution, are inviable. We show that the uvrD recG cells die a \u201cdeath-by-recombination\u201d in which IRIs accumulate blocking chromosome segregation. First, their death requires RecA HR protein. Second, the death is accompanied by cytogenetically visible failure to segregate chromosomes. Third, FISH analyses show that the unsegregated chromosomes have completed replication, supporting the hypothesis that unresolved IRIs prevented the segregation. Fourth, we show that RecQ and induction of the SOS response are required for the accumulation of replicated, unsegregated chromosomes and death, as are RecF, RecO, and RecJ. ExoI exonuclease and MutL mismatch-repair protein are partially required. This set of genes is similar but not identical to those that promote death-by-recombination of \u0394uvrD \u0394ruv cells. The data support models in which RecQ promotes the net accumulation in cells of IRIs and RecG promotes resolution of IRIs that form via pathways not wholly identical to those that produce the IRIs resolved by RuvABC. This implies that RecG resolves intermediates other than or in addition to standard Holliday junctions resolved by RuvABC. The role of RecQ in net accumulation of IRIs may be shared by one or more of its human homologues.",

     "abstract": "Lysine 56 is acetylated on newly synthesized histone H3 in yeast, Drosophila and mammalian cells. All of the proteins involved in histone H3 lysine 56 (H3K56) acetylation are important for maintaining genome integrity. These include Rtt109, a histone acetyltransferase, responsible for acetylating H3K56, Asf1, a histone H3/H4 chaperone, and Hst3 and Hst4, histone deacetylases which remove the acetyl group from H3K56. Here we demonstrate a new role for Rtt109 and H3K56 acetylation in maintaining repetitive DNA sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that cells lacking RTT109 had a high level of CAG/CTG repeat contractions and a twofold increase in breakage at CAG/CTG repeats. In addition, repeat contractions were significantly increased in cells lacking ASF1 and in an hst3\u0394hst4\u0394 double mutant. Because the Rtt107/Rtt101 complex was previously shown to be recruited to stalled replication forks in an Rtt109-dependent manner, we tested whether this complex was involved. However, contractions in rtt109\u0394 cells were not due to an inability to recruit the Rtt107/Rtt101 complex to repeats, as absence of these proteins had no effect on repeat stability. On the other hand, Dnl4 and Rad51-dependent pathways did play a role in creating some of the repeat contractions in rtt109\u0394 cells. Our results show that H3K56 acetylation by Rtt109 is important for stabilizing DNA repeats, likely by facilitating proper nucleosome assembly at the replication fork to prevent DNA structure formation and subsequent slippage events or fork breakage.",

Both proteins have weakly conserved C-terminal regions (CTDs), with the CTD of Pms1 harboring an essential endonuclease activity. These proteins also have conserved N-terminal domains (NTDs) that bind and hydrolyze ATP and bind to DNA. To better understand Pms1 functions and potential interactions with DNA and/or other proteins, we solved the 2.5\u00a0\u00c5 crystal structure of yeast Pms1 (yPms1) NTD. The structure is similar to the homologous NTDs of Escherichia coli MutL and human PMS2, including the site involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis. The structure reveals a number of conserved, positively charged surface residues that do not interact with other residues in the NTD and are therefore candidates for interactions with DNA, with the CTD and/or with other proteins. When these were replaced with glutamate, several replacements resulted in yeast strains with elevated mutation rates. Two replacements also resulted in NTDs with decreased DNA binding affinity in vitro, suggesting that these residues contribute to DNA binding that is important for mismatch repair. Elevated mutation rates also resulted from surface residue replacements that did not affect DNA binding, suggesting that these conserved residues serve other functions, possibly involving interactions with other MMR proteins.",

     "abstract": "SN1-type methylating agents generate O6-methyl guanine (O6-meG), which is a potently mutagenic, toxic, and recombinogenic DNA adduct. Recognition of O6-meG:T mismatches by mismatch repair (MMR) causes sister chromatid exchanges, which are representative of homologous recombination (HR) events. Although the MMR-dependent mutagenicity and toxicity caused by O6-meG has been studied, the mechanisms of recombination induced by O6-meG are poorly understood. To explore the HR and MMR genetic interactions in mammals, we used the Rad51d and Mlh1 mouse models. Ablation of Mlh1 did not appreciably influence the developmental phenotypes conferred by the absence of Rad51d. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) deficient in Rad51d can only proliferate in p53-deficient background. Therefore, Rad51d\u2212/\u2212Mlh1\u2212/\u2212Trp53\u2212/\u2212 MEFs with a combined deficiency of HR and MMR were generated and comparisons between MLH1 and RAD51D status were made. To our knowledge, these MEFs are the first mammalian model system for combined HR and MMR defects. Rad51d-deficient MEFs were 5.3-fold sensitive to N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) compared to the Rad51d-proficient MEFs. A pronounced G2/M arrest in Rad51d-deficient cells was accompanied by an accumulation of \u03b3-H2AX and apoptosis. Mlh1-deficient MEFs were resistant to MNNG and showed no G2/M arrest or apoptosis at the doses used. Importantly, loss of Mlh1 alleviated sensitivity of Rad51d-deficient cells to MNNG, in addition to reducing \u03b3-H2AX, G2/M arrest and apoptosis. Collectively, the data support the hypothesis that MMR-dependent sensitization of HR-deficient cells is specific for O6-meG and suggest that HR resolves DNA intermediates created by MMR recognition of O6-meG:T. This study provides insight into recombinogenic mechanisms of carcinogenesis and chemotherapy resulting from O6-meG adducts.",

However, recent studies suggest that RecG provides a more general defence against pathological DNA replication. We have postulated that this is achieved through the ability of RecG to eliminate substrates that the replication restart protein, PriA, could otherwise exploit to re-replicate the chromosome. Without RecG, PriA triggers a cascade of events that interfere with the duplication and segregation of chromosomes.

To examine the question of Pol \u03b2 involvement in LP BER, we made use of nucleotide excision repair-deficient human XPA cells expressing UVDE (XPA-UVDE), which introduces a nick directly 5\u2032 to the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer or 6-4 photoproduct, leaving ends with 3\u2032-OH and 5\u2032-phosphorylated UV lesion.

This was the first evidence of Pol \u03b2 recruitment in LP BER in vivo. In cell extract, a 5\u2032-blocked oligodeoxynucleotide substrate containing a nicked 5\u2032-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer was repaired by Pol \u03b2-dependent LP BER.

     "abstract": "The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system is highly conserved and vital for preserving genomic integrity. Current mechanistic models for MMR are mainly derived from in vitro assays including reconstitution of strand-specific MMR and DNA binding assays using short oligonucleotides. However, fundamental questions regarding the mechanism and regulation in the context of cellular DNA replication remain. Using synchronized populations of HeLa cells we demonstrated that hMSH2, hMLH1 and PCNA localize to the chromatin during S-phase, and accumulate to a greater extent in cells treated with a DNA alkylating agent. In addition, using small interfering RNA to deplete hMSH2, we demonstrated that hMLH1 localization to the chromatin is hMSH2-dependent. hMSH2/hMLH1/PCNA proteins, when associated with the chromatin, form a complex that is greatly enhanced by DNA damage. The DNA damage caused by high doses of alkylating agents leads to a G2 arrest after only one round of replication. In these G2-arrested cells, an hMSH2/hMLH1 complex persists on chromatin, however, PCNA is no longer in the complex. Cells treated with a lower dose of alkylating agent require two rounds of replication before cells arrest in G2. In the first S-phase, the MMR proteins form a complex with PCNA, however, during the second S-phase PCNA is missing from that complex. The distinction between these complexes may suggest separate functions for the MMR proteins in damage repair and signaling. Additionally, using confocal immunofluorescence, we observed a population of hMSH6 that localized to the nucleolus. This population is significantly reduced after DNA damage suggesting that the protein is shuttled out of the nucleolus in response to damage. In contrast, hMLH1 is excluded from the nucleolus at all times. Thus, the nucleolus may act to segregate a population of hMSH2\u2013hMSH6 from hMLH1\u2013hPMS2 such that, in the absence of DNA damage, an inappropriate response is not invoked.",

     "abstract": "Although DNA in eukaryotes is packaged in nucleosomes, it remains vulnerable to oxidative damage that can result from normal cellular metabolism, ionizing radiation, and various chemical agents. Oxidatively damaged DNA is repaired in a stepwise fashion via the base excision repair (BER) pathway, which begins with the excision of damaged bases by DNA glycosylases. We reported recently that the human DNA glycosylase hNTH1 (human Endonuclease III), a member of the HhH GpG superfamily of glycosylases, can excise thymine glycol lesions from nucleosomes without requiring or inducing nucleosome disruption; optimally oriented lesions are excised with an efficiency approaching that seen for naked DNA [1]. To determine if this property is shared by human DNA glycoylases in the Fpg/Nei family, we investigated the activity of NEIL1 on defined nucleosome substrates. We report here that the cellular concentrations and apparent kcat/KM ratios for hNTH1 and NEIL1 are similar. Additionally, after adjustment for non-specific DNA binding, hNTH1 and NEIL1 proved to have similar intrinsic activities toward nucleosome substrates. However, NEIL1 and hNTH1 differ in that NEIL1 binds undamaged DNA far more avidly than hNTH1. As a result, hNTH1 is able to excise both accessible and sterically occluded lesions from nucleosomes at physiological concentrations, while the high non-specific DNA affinity of NEIL1 would likely hinder its ability to process sterically occluded lesions in cells. These results suggest that, in vivo, NEIL1 functions either at nucleosome-free regions (such as those near replication forks) or with cofactors that limit its non-specific binding to DNA.",

To assess the location and intracellular activity of the OGG1 protein in response to oxidative stress, we have utilised a fluorescence\u2013quench molecular beacon switch containing a 8-oxo-dG:C base pair and a fluorescent and quencher molecule at opposite ends of a hairpin oligonucleotide. Oxidative stress was induced by treatment with potassium bromate. Flow cytometry demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase in the activity of OGG1 that was detected by the fluorescence produced when the oligonucleotide was cleaved in the cells treated with potassium bromate. This signal is highly specific and not detectable in OGG1 knock out cells. Induction of OGG1 activity is not a result of induction of OGG1 gene expression as assessed by qPCR suggesting a role for protein stabilisation or increased OGG1 catalytic activity. High resolution confocal microscopy pinpointed the location of the fluorescent molecular beacon in live cells to perinuclear regions that were identified as mitochondria by co-staining with mitotracker dye. There is no evidence of cut beacon within the nuclear compartment of the cell. Control experiments with a positive control beacon (G:C base pair and lacking the DAB quencher) did not result in mitochondrial localisation of fluorescence signal indicating that the dye does not accumulate in mitochondria independent of OGG1 activity. Furthermore, faint nuclear staining was apparent confirming that the beacon structure is able to enter the nucleus. In conclusion, these data indicate that the mitochondria are the major site for OGG1 repair activity under conditions of oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Most bacteria, including Escherichia coli, lack an enzyme that can phosphorylate deoxycytidine and its analogs. Consequently, most studies of toxicity and mutagenicity of cytosine analogs use ribonucleosides such as 5-azacytidine (AzaC) and zebularine (Zeb) instead of their deoxynucleoside forms, 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (AzadC) and 2\u2032-deoxy-zebularine (dZeb). The former analogs are incorporated into both RNA and DNA creating complex physiological responses in cells. To circumvent this problem, we introduced into E. coli the Drosophila deoxynucleoside kinase (Dm-dNK), which has a relaxed substrate specificity, and tested these cells for sensitivity to AzadC and dZeb. We find that Dm-dNK expression increases substantially sensitivity of cells to these analogs and dZeb is very mutagenic in cells expressing the kinase. Furthermore, toxicity of dZeb in these cells requires DNA mismatch correction system suggesting a mechanism for its toxicity and mutagenicity. The fluorescence properties of dZeb were used to quantify the amount of this analog incorporated into cellular DNA of mismatch repair-deficient cells expressing Dm-dNK and the results showed that in a mismatch correction-defective strain a high percentage of DNA bases may be replaced with the analog without long term toxic effects. This study demonstrates that the mechanism by which Zeb and dZeb cause cell death is fundamentally different than the mechanism of toxicity of AzaC and AzadC. It also opens up a new way to study the mechanism of action of deoxycytidine analogs that are used in anticancer chemotherapy.",

While this complementation study provided the first evidence that APN-1 possesses the ability to act on DNA lesions that are processed by AP endonucleases/3\u2032-diesterase activities, no former studies were conducted to examine its biological importance in vivo. Herein, we show that C. elegans knockdown for apn-1 by RNAi displayed phenotypes that are directly linked with a defect in maintaining the integrity of the genome. apn-1(RNAi) animals exhibited a 5-fold increase in the frequency of mutations at a gfp-lacZ reporter and showed sensitivities to DNA damaging agents such as methyl methane sulfonate and hydrogen peroxide that produce AP site lesions and strand breaks with blocked 3\u2032-ends. The apn-1(RNAi) worms also displayed a delay in the division of the P1 blastomere, a defect that is consistent with the accumulation of unrepaired lesions. Longevity was only compromised, if the apn-1(RNAi) animals were challenged with the DNA damaging agents. We showed that apn-1(RNAi) knockdown suppressed formation of apoptotic corpses in the germline caused by an overburden of AP sites generated from uracil DNA glycosylase mediated removal of misincorporated uracil. Finally, we showed that depletion of APN-1 by RNAi partially rescued the lethality resulting from uracil misincorporation, suggesting that APN-1 is an important AP endonuclease for repair of misincorporated uracil.",

Based on protein sequence alignments, we identified four putative Fpg/Nei family members, as well as a putative Nth protein in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv. All four Fpg/Nei proteins were successfully overexpressed using a bicistronic vector created in our laboratory. The MtuNth protein was also overexpressed in soluble form. The substrate specificities of the purified enzymes were characterized in vitro with oligodeoxynucleotide substrates containing single lesions. Some were further characterized by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis of products released from \u03b3-irradiated DNA. MtuFpg1 has substrate specificity similar to that of EcoFpg. Both EcoFpg and MtuFpg1 are more efficient at removing spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) than 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). However, MtuFpg1 shows a substantially increased opposite base discrimination compared to EcoFpg. MtuFpg2 contains only the C-terminal domain of an Fpg protein and has no detectable DNA binding activity or DNA glycosylase/lyase activity and thus appears to be a pseudogene. MtuNei1 recognizes oxidized pyrimidines on both double-stranded and single-stranded DNA and exhibits uracil DNA glycosylase activity. MtuNth recognizes a variety of oxidized bases, including urea, 5,6-dihydrouracil (DHU), 5-hydroxyuracil (5-OHU), 5-hydroxycytosine (5-OHC) and methylhydantoin (MeHyd). Both MtuNei1 and MtuNth excise thymine glycol (Tg); however, MtuNei1 strongly prefers the (5R) isomers, whereas MtuNth recognizes only the (5S) isomers. MtuNei2 did not demonstrate activity in vitro as a recombinant protein, but like MtuNei1 when expressed in Escherichia coli, it decreased the spontaneous mutation frequency of both the fpg mutY nei triple and nei nth double mutants, suggesting that MtuNei2 is functionally active in vivo recognizing both guanine and cytosine oxidation products. The kinetic parameters of the MtuFpg1, MtuNei1 and MtuNth proteins on selected substrates were also determined and compared to those of their E. coli homologs.",

In the last decades growing evidence of the major role played by DNA repair systems in the developing of bladder cancer has been provided. To better investigate the involvement of DNA repair genes previously reported to be significantly associated with bladder cancer risk, we examined in a case\u2013control study (456 cases and 376 hospital controls) 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 10 DNA repair genes, through a better gene coverage and a deep investigation of the haplotype role. A single SNP analysis showed a significantly increased risk given by XRCC1-rs915927 G allele (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.55, CI 95% 1.02\u20132.37 for dominant model) and a protective effect of the rare alleles of 3 ERCC1 SNPs: rs967591 (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.66, CI 95% 0.46\u20130.95), rs735482 (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.62, CI 95% 0.42\u20130.90) and rs2336219 (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.63, CI 95% 0.43\u20130.93). Haplotype analysis revealed that cases had a statistically significant excess of XRCC3-TAGT and ERCC1-GAT haplotypes, whereas ERCC1-AAC, MGMT-TA, XRCC1-TGCC and ERCC2-TGAA haplotypes were significantly underrepresented. Together with other published data on large case\u2013control studies, our findings provide epidemiological evidence supporting a link between DNA repair gene variants and bladder cancer development, and suggest that the effects of high-order interactions should be taken into account as modulating factors affecting bladder cancer risk. A detailed characterization of DNA repair genetic variation is warranted and might ultimately help to identify multiple susceptibility variants that could be responsible for joint effects on the risk.",

Several genetically determined mouse models of WS have been generated, however, none develops features of premature aging or an elevated risk of neoplasia unless additional genetic perturbations are introduced. In order to determine whether differences in cellular phenotype could explain the discrepant phenotypes of Wrn\u2212/\u2212 mice and WRN-deficient humans, we compared the cellular phenotype of newly derived Wrn\u2212/\u2212 mouse primary fibroblasts with previous analyses of primary and transformed fibroblasts from WS patients and with newly derived, WRN-depleted human primary fibroblasts. These analyses confirmed previously reported cellular phenotypes of WRN-mutant and WRN-deficient human fibroblasts, and demonstrated that the human WRN-deficient cellular phenotype can be detected in cells grown in 5% or in 20% oxygen. In contrast, we did not identify prominent cellular phenotypes present in WRN-deficient human cells in Wrn\u2212/\u2212 mouse fibroblasts. Our results indicate that human and mouse fibroblasts have different functional requirements for WRN protein, and that the absence of a strong cellular phenotype may in part explain the failure of Wrn\u2212/\u2212 mice to develop an organismal phenotype resembling Werner syndrome.",

     "abstract": "Spontaneous mitotic recombination is a potential source of genetic changes such as loss of heterozygosity and chromosome translocations, which may lead to genetic disease. In this study we have used a rad52 hyper-recombination mutant, rad52-Y66A, to investigate the process of spontaneous heteroallelic recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We find that spontaneous recombination has different genetic requirements, depending on whether the recombination event occurs between chromosomes or between chromosome and plasmid sequences. The hyper-recombination phenotype of the rad52-Y66A mutation is epistatic with deletion of MRE11, which is required for establishment of DNA damage-induced cohesion. Moreover, single-cell analysis of strains expressing YFP-tagged Rad52-Y66A reveals a close to wild-type frequency of focus formation, but with foci lasting 6 times longer. This result suggests that spontaneous DNA lesions that require recombinational repair occur at the same frequency in wild-type and rad52-Y66A cells, but that the recombination process is slow in rad52-Y66A cells. Taken together, we propose that the slow recombinational DNA repair in the rad52-Y66A mutant leads to a by-pass of the window-of-opportunity for sister chromatid recombination normally promoted by MRE11-dependent damage-induced cohesion thereby causing a shift towards interchromosomal recombination.",

It is involved in transcription, cell cycle regulation, RNA splicing and the nucleotide excision DNA repair pathway (NER). Depending on the process in which it is functioning, the composition of TFIIH varies and activities of its subunits are differentially regulated. Here we focused on interplay between the Ssl2, Tfb2 and Tfb5 subunits of TFIIH from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that Tfb2 bridges the Ssl2 helicase and the NER-specific Tfb5 subunit. Moreover, the Tfb5-interacting domain of Tfb2 also binds nucleic acids (NA), although the addition of Tfb5 triggers dissociation of NA from Tfb2. In yeast cells, deletion of TFB5 is more detrimental to NER than loss of the Tfb5/NA-interacting domain of Tfb2, while combining these mutations resulted in suppression of the UV sensitivity of tfb5\u0394. The implications of our findings in regards to TFIIH function and group A trichothiodystrophy, an inherited disease associated with mutations in the human TFB5 gene, are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX), a member of the anthracycline group, is a widely used drug in cancer therapy. The mechanisms of DOX action include topoisomerase II-poisoning, free radical release, DNA adducts and interstrand cross-link (ICL) formation. Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is involved in the removal of helix-distorting lesions and chemical adducts, however, little is known about the response of NER-deficient cell lines to anti-tumoral drugs like DOX. Wild type and XPD-mutated cells, harbouring mutations in different regions of this gene and leading to XP-D, XP/CS or TTD diseases, were treated with this drug and analyzed for cell cycle arrest and DNA damage by comet assay. The formation of DSBs was also investigated by determination of \u03b3H2AX foci. Our results indicate that all three NER-deficient cell lines tested are more sensitive to DOX treatment, when compared to wild type cells or XP cells complemented by the wild type XPD cDNA, suggesting that NER is involved in the removal of DOX-induced lesions. The cell cycle analysis showed the characteristic G2 arrest in repair-proficient MRC5 cell line after DOX treatment, whereas the repair-deficient cell lines presented significant increase in sub-G1 fraction. The NER-deficient cell lines do not show different patterns of DNA damage formation as assayed by comet assay and phosphorylated H2AX foci formation. Knock-down of topoisomerase II\u03b1 with siRNA leads to increased survival in both MRC5 and XP cells, however, XP cell line still remained significantly more sensitive to the treatment by DOX. Our study suggests that the enhanced sensitivity is due to DOX-induced DNA damage that is subject to NER, as we observed decreased unscheduled DNA synthesis in XP-deficient cells upon DOX treatment. Furthermore, the complementation of the XPD-function abolished the observed sensitivity at lower DOX concentrations, suggesting that the XPD helicase activity is involved in the repair of DOX-induced lesions.",

The aims of this study were to determine whether there are threshold doses for their activation and investigate the molecular pathways and possible links between the G2 to M transition and hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS). Two human glioblastoma cell lines (T98G\u2013HRS+ and U373\u2013HRS\u2212) unsynchronized or enriched in G2 were irradiated and flow cytometry with BrdU or histone H3 phosphorylation analysis used to assess cell cycle progression and a clonogenic assay to measure radiation survival. The involvement of ATM, Wee1 and PARP was studied using chemical inhibitors. We found that cells irradiated in either the G1 or S phase of the cell cycle transiently accumulate in G2 in a dose-dependent manner after exposure to doses as low as 0.2\u00a0Gy. Only Wee1 inhibition reduced this G2 accumulation. A block of the G2 to M transition was found after irradiation in G2 but occurs only above a threshold dose, which is cell line dependent, and requires ATM activity after exposure to doses above 0.5\u00a0Gy. A failure to activate this early G2/M checkpoint correlates with low dose radiosensitization. These results provide evidence that after exposure to low doses of IR two distinct G2/M checkpoints are activated, each in a dose-dependent manner, with distinct threshold doses and involving different damage signalling pathways and confirm links between the early G2/M checkpoint and hyper-radiosensitivity.",

Here, we show that ABH1 unexpectedly has a second activity, cleaving DNA at abasic (AP) sites such as those arising spontaneously from alkylation-dependent depurination reactions. The DNA cleavage activity of ABH1 does not require added Fe2+ or 2-oxoglutarate, is not inhibited by EDTA, and is unaffected by mutation of the putative metal-binding residues, indicating that this activity arises from an active site distinct from that used for demethylation. AP-specific DNA cleavage was shown to occur by a lyase mechanism, rather than by hydrolysis, with the enzyme remaining associated with the DNA product. ABH1 can cleave at closely spaced AP-sites on opposite DNA strands yielding double-strand breaks in vitro and this reaction may relate to the physiological role of this unexpected AP lyase activity.",

     "abstract": "The mechanism by which double-strand DNA breaks are repaired in the radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans is not well understood. This organism lacks the RecBCD helicase/nuclease, which processes broken DNA ends in other bacteria. The RecF pathway is an alternative pathway for recombination and DNA repair in E. coli, when RecBCD is absent due to mutation, and D. radiodurans may rely on enzymes of this pathway for double-strand break repair. The RecJ exonuclease is thought to process broken DNA ends for the RecF pathway. We attempted to delete the recJ gene from D. radiodurans, using homologous recombination to replace the gene with a streptomycin-resistance cassette. We were unable to obtain a complete deletion mutant, in which the gene is deleted from all of the chromosome copies in this polyploid organism. Quantitative real-time PCR shows that the heterozygous mutants have a recJ gene copy that is ca. 10\u201330% that of the wild-type. Mutants with reduced recJ gene copy grow slowly and are more sensitive than wild-type to UV irradiation, gamma irradiation, and hydrogen peroxide. The mutants are as resistant as wild-type to methyl-methanesulfonate. The D. radiodurans RecJ protein was expressed in E. coli and purified under denaturing conditions. The re-folded protein has nuclease activity on single-stranded DNA with specificity similar to that of E. coli RecJ exonuclease.",

     "abstract": "The ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway plays an important role in DNA damage signaling and repair by facilitating the recruitment and activation of DNA repair factors and signaling proteins at sites of damaged chromatin. Proteasome activity is generally not thought to be required for activation of apical signaling kinases including the PI3K-related kinases (PIKKs) ATM, ATR, and DNA-PK that orchestrate downstream signaling cascades in response to diverse genotoxic stimuli. In a previous work, we showed that inhibition of the proteasome by MG-132 suppressed 53BP1 (p53 binding protein1) phosphorylation as well as RPA2 (replication protein A2) phosphorylation in response to the topoisomerase I (TopI) poison camptothecin (CPT). To address the mechanism of proteasome-dependent RPA2 phosphorylation, we investigated the effects of proteasome inhibitors on the upstream PIKKs. MG-132 sharply suppressed CPT-induced DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation, a marker of the activation, whereas the phosphorylation of ATM and ATR substrates was only slightly suppressed by MG-132, suggesting that DNA-PK among the PIKKs is specifically regulated by the proteasome in response to CPT. On the other hand, MG-132 did not suppress DNA-PK activation in response to UV or IR. MG-132 blocked the interaction between DNA-PKcs and Ku heterodimer enhanced by CPT, and hydroxyurea pre-treatment completely abolished CPT-induced DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation, indicating a requirement for ongoing DNA replication. CPT-induced TopI degradation occurred independent of DNA-PK activation, suggesting that DNA-PK activation does not require degradation of trapped TopI complexes. The combined results suggest that CPT-dependent replication fork collapse activates DNA-PK signaling through a proteasome dependent, TopI degradation-independent pathway. The implications of DNA-PK activation in the context of TopI poison-based therapies are discussed.",

However, although it has been observed that certain heavy metals can inhibit single strand break (SSB) rejoining, the effects of these metals on SSB end-processing enzymes has not previously been investigated. Accordingly, we have investigated the potential inhibition of polynucleotide kinase (PNK)-dependent single strand break repair by six metals: cadmium, cobalt, copper, nickel, lead and zinc. It was found that micromolar concentrations of cadmium and copper are able to inhibit the phosphatase and kinase activities of PNK in both human cell extracts and purified recombinant protein, while the other metals had no effect at the concentrations tested. The inhibition of PNK by environmentally and physiologically relevant concentrations of cadmium and copper suggests a novel means by which these toxic heavy metals may exert their carcinogenic and neurotoxic effects.",

Only the 300-kDa form is stored in eggs, where its concentration of about 65\u00a0pM is much lower than those of other replication and repair proteins including the accessory pol \u03b6 subunit REV7. In fertilized eggs, the levels of this polypeptide did not change until neurula; the larger 340-kDa form first appeared at stages after gastrula, suggesting a pattern of regulation during development.

If such mutations are beneficial to the affected cell, in the sense of allowing a restart of proliferation, they are called adaptive mutations. In order to identify cellular processes responsible for adaptive mutagenesis in eukaryotes, we study frameshift mutations occurring during auxotrophy-caused cell cycle arrest in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Previous work has shown that an exposure of cells to UV irradiation during prolonged cell cycle arrest resulted in an increased incidence of mutations. In the present work, we determined the influence of defects in the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway on the incidence of UV-induced adaptive mutations in stationary cells. The mutation frequency was decreased in Rad16-deficient cells and further decreased in Rad16/Rad26 double-deficient cells. A knockout of the RAD14 gene, the ortholog of the human XPA gene, even resulted in a nearly complete abolishment of UV-induced mutagenesis in cell cycle-arrested cells. Thus, the NER pathway, responsible for a normally accurate repair of UV-induced DNA damage, paradoxically is required for the generation and/or fixation of UV-induced frameshift mutations specifically in non-replicating cells.",
