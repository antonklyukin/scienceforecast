     "abstract": "Breast cancer rates are lower amongst women from more socio-economically deprived areas. However, their mortality rates are higher. One explanation of this breast cancer paradox is that women from more deprived areas are less likely to attend breast cancer screening programmes. This systematic review is the first to examine this issue in Europe. A systematic review of Embase, Medline and PsychINFO (from 2008 to 2019) was undertaken (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018083703). Observational studies were included if they were based in Europe, measured breast cancer screening uptake, compared at least two areas, included an area-level measure of socio-economic deprivation and were published in the English language. The Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist was used to assess study quality and risk of bias. Thirteen studies from seven different European countries met our inclusion criteria and were included in the review. In ten of the thirteen studies, there was a significant negative association between screening uptake and area-level socio-economic deprivation \u2013 with women living in more socio-economically deprived neighbourhoods less likely to attend breast cancer screening. Although universal screening programmes were provided in most studies, there were still strong negative associations between screening uptake and area-level socio-economic deprivation. Future breast cancer screening strategies should acknowledge these challenges, and consider developing targeted interventions in more deprived areas to increase screening participation.",

We describe current trends in treatment and survival using the largest cancer dataset in the United States.We analyzed the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2014, for all patients with diagnosis of meningioma.201,765 cases were analyzed. Patients were most commonly White (81.9%) females (73.2%) with a median age of 64 years. Fifty percent of patients were diagnosed by imaging. Patients were reported as grade I (24.9%), grade II (5.0%), grade III (0.7%), or unknown WHO grade (69.4%). Patients diagnosed by imaging were older, received treatment in community facilities, had higher Charlson-Deyo score, and a lower rate of private insurance. Watchful waiting was the most common treatment modality (46.7%), followed by surgery only (40%). Grade II and III patients were more likely to receive therapy. Watchful waiting increased from 35.2% in 2004 to 51.4% in 2014. Younger age, male gender, private insurance, and treatment in academic facilities were determinants for receipt of surgery and/or radiation. Median survival was 12.6 years, higher in histologically confirmed cases (13.1 years). Older patients, Blacks, males, those that received radiation plus surgery, and were treated in community facilities had an increased risk of mortality.Over half of patients were diagnosed by imaging, suggesting a higher role of clinical determinants over histological confirmation in treatment decisions. Watchful waiting as initial management is increasing. Our survival analysis favored histological confirmation. Patients receiving radiation and surgery had an increased risk of mortality.",

     "abstract": "Chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma form the majority of malignant primary tumours of bone. High-grade bone sarcomas require intensive treatment due to their rapid and invasive growth pattern and metastasising capabilities. This nationwide study covers overall incidence, treatment and survival patterns of bone sarcomas in a 15-year period (2000\u20132014) in the total population of the Netherlands.Data for this study were derived from the Netherlands Cancer Registry, which receives primary notification from the national pathology database. Classification and categorisation was based on the ICD-O-3 classification and the WHO classification 2013 applied according to our clinicopathological expertise. Overall incidence over the 15-year-period was calculated as a rate per 100,000 person-years (using the European Standardised Rate, ESR). Survival was analysed with Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression.Incidence for high-grade chondrosarcoma (n\u2009=\u2009429) was estimated at 0.15 per 100,000 ESR, and 5-year overall survival at 65.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 61.0%\u201370.4%). Incidence for high-grade central osteosarcoma (n\u2009=\u2009605) was estimated at 0.25 per 100,000 ESR and 5-year survival at 53.9% (95%CI: 49.7%\u201358.0%). Ewing sarcoma incidence (n\u2009=\u2009334) was estimated at 0.15 per 100,000 ESR and 5-year survival at 59.3% (95%CI: 53.5%\u201364.6%). For high-grade central osteosarcoma, treatment at a bone tumour centre was associated with better survival (HR 0.593).This study provides comprehensive incidence estimates for all the main primary bone sarcomas over a 15-year time period in a Northern European country with little migration. Centralisation of bone sarcoma care improves the clinical outcome in osteosarcoma.",

The least favourable outcome is typically seen when carcinoma is suspected prior to surgery. Only a few studies have addressed the prognosis based on the way of detection for PMC, and they have been limited to retrospective single-center studies. We hypothesize that the \u201cway of detection\u201d may predict prognosis.The aim was to calculate the incidence and outcome of PMC based on the way of detection and to identify patients that may be suitable for active surveillance.This national cohort study consists of 803 patients diagnosed with PMC in Denmark from 1996 to 2015. Patients were identified from the DATHYRCA database and allocated into groups according to the way of detection leading to surgery: Incidental at surgery (n\u2009=\u2009527), non-incidental with symptoms suspected from the index tumor (n\u2009=\u2009134) and non-incidental with symptoms suspected from a metastasis (n\u2009=\u2009142).Age-standardized incidence rates increased from 0.35 per 100,000 per year in 1996 to 1.19 per 100,000 per year in 2015. A significant rise in incidence was found for both the incidental group and non-incidental group with symptoms suspected from a metastasis. Recurrence free survival was significantly worse for patients with suspicion of metastasis prior to surgery than patient groups without. No difference in mortality was found between groups.PMC patients without suspicion of metastasis have the same low risk of recurrence as incidental cases and may be candidates for active surveillance.",

     "abstract": "Myeloma, one of the most common haematological malignancies worldwide arises in the bone marrow. Incidence rates vary by age and ethnicity but reasons behind these trends are unknown. Treatment of myeloma has changed significantly over recent decades, resulting in longer survival and decreased mortality.From data supplied by the Ministry of Health, all new registrations of and deaths from myeloma between 1985 and 2016 were extracted. Trends in age-specific rates were assessed using the method of Armitage. Age-standardised rates were calculated, and trends in age-adjusted rates analysed using the Mantel-Haenszel extension chi-square test. Age-adjusted incidence and mortality rate ratios were calculated. Myeloma-specific survival was visualised using Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable hazard ratios calculated using Cox regression.Between 1985 and 2016, 7826 New Zealanders were registered with myeloma. Over this time the age-specific incidence of myeloma increased significantly for men, who had higher rates than women. Myeloma mortality was highest in Maori men. Men had higher mortality rates than women in all time periods. Since 1995\u20131999, mortality has decreased in women whereas in men it has declined since about 2000\u20132004. Survival has increased significantly since 1990 but Maori still have a higher risk of death than non-Maori.The patterns of variation in myeloma incidence, mortality and survival, as well as their trends over time may be used to assist research into the causes and management of myeloma in New Zealand.",

     "abstract": "Peritoneal malignant mesothelioma is a rare disease for which few population-based studies are available. The aim of this study was to describe the evolution of the incidence and survival of peritoneal malignant mesothelioma in France between 1989 and 2015, using data derived from the French network of cancer registries.Age world-standardized incidence rates and overall survival were calculated using data from 16 French cancer registries. Log-linear Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the average annual percentage change in incidence rates. Overall survival was performed using age-adjusted Cox proportional hazards model.In French men, the incidence has increased quietly over the reporting period from 0.07 to 0.10 with a maximum of 0.16 per 100,000 persons-years in 2001\u20132003. For women, the increase in incidence has been lower than for men over the period 1989\u20132015, ranging from 0.04 to 0.11. A better prognosis was associated with a diagnosis made after 2000 (HR\u2009=\u20091.76; p = 0.013), the epithelioid histological type (p = 0.003), and the fact of being a woman, which has a 5-year risk of death half that of men (HR\u2009=\u20090.55; p = 0.001), regardless of age, diagnosis period or histology.Our results are similar to those currently available for other countries. In France, peritoneal mesothelioma remains a rare and fatal cancer with a small increase in the incidence rate since 1989 and a median survival of 1\u2009year; it seemed to develop equally in women and men over this period of time.",

The current study aimed to assess real-world characteristics, treatment patterns, and overall survival (OS) of patients with mUC treated in the United States (US).We conducted a retrospective, observational analysis of patients with mUC from the Flatiron Health longitudinal database from 2011 to 2017. Treatment patterns of patients who started systemic first-line therapy (1\u2009L cohort) or second-line therapy following platinum-based first-line therapy (2\u2009L cohort) were described using medication order and administration data. Kaplan-Meier analyses were used to assess OS from the start of first- and second-line therapy in the 1\u2009L and 2\u2009L cohorts, respectively.A total of 1811 patients qualified for the 1\u2009L cohort (median age [range], 72 [32\u201384] years); 476 met the criteria for the 2\u2009L cohort (median age [range], 71 [40\u201384] years).

To date, no study has investigated the association between elevated CRP and incidents of cancer among Mexican Americans. In the current prospective cohort study, we measured pre-diagnostic CRP levels in serum samples and evaluated their relationships with demographic characteristics and health behaviors associated with cancer risk among 2753 Mexican Americans selected from the Mano-A-Mano Mexican American Cohort Study. At baseline, median levels of serum CRP significantly differed by demographics (sex, age category, marital status, and education levels) and health behaviors (cigarette smoking status, alcohol drinking status, BMI category, and physical activity levels). In the multivariable analysis, the study participants who were women, older, never drinking alcohol, overweight or obese, and physically inactive had increased likelihood of having high CRP levels (\u2265 median levels among all study participants) compared to their counterparts. A total of 177 cancer cases were identified during the follow-up with a median follow-up time of 127 months. In the quartile analysis, study participants in the 4th quartile with highest CRP levels had significantly 1.88 fold increased risk of cancer (hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20091.88, 95%CI: 1.12, 3.13) compared to those in the 1st quartile with lowest CRP levels.

One area, western Kenya, has a high risk of ESCC, including many young cases (<30 years old), but has limited prior study of potential risk factors. Thermal injury from hot food and beverages and exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) have been proposed as important risk factors for ESCC in other settings. The beverage of choice in western Kenya is milky tea (chai).Healthy individuals >18 years of age who were accompanying relatives to an endoscopy unit were recruited to participate. The preferred initial temperature of chai consumption in these adults was measured by questionnaire and digital thermometer. Comparisons of these results were assessed by kappa statistics. Concentrations of 26 selected PAHs were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in samples of 11 brands of commercial tea leaves commonly consumed in Kenya.Kappa values demonstrated moderate agreement between questionnaire responses and measured temperatures. The mean preferred chai temperatures were 72.1\u2009\u00b0C overall, 72.6\u2009\u00b0C in men (n\u2009=\u200978), and 70.2\u2009\u00b0C in women (n\u2009=\u200922; p\u2009<\u20090.05).

However, these factors can be difficult to modify. More research is needed to identify individual-level modifiable factors that may improve screening and subsequent cancer outcomes in this population. The aim of this study was to examine cancer fatalism (i.e., the belief that there is little or nothing one can do to lower his/her risk of developing cancer) as a determinant of adherence to national screening guidelines for colorectal, breast, prostate, and cervical cancer among Hispanics/Latinos.Participants were from the multi-site Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) Sociocultural Ancillary Study (N\u2009=\u20095313). The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Health Interview National Trends Survey was used to assess cancer fatalism and receipt of cancer screening. Adherence was defined as following screening guidelines from United States Preventive Services Task Force and the American Cancer Society during the study period.Adjusting for well-established determinants of cancer screening and covariates (health insurance status, income, education, acculturation, age, Hispanic/Latino background), lower cancer fatalism was marginally associated with greater adherence to screening for colorectal (OR 1.13, 95% CI [.99\u20131.30], p\u2009=\u2009.07), breast (OR 1.16, 95% CI [.99\u20131.36], p\u2009=\u2009.08) and prostate cancer (OR 1.18, 95% CI [.97\u20131.43], p\u2009=\u2009.10), but not cervical cancer.The associations of cancer fatalism were small and marginal, underlining that sociocultural factors are more robust determinants of cancer screening adherence among Hispanics/Latinos.",

We searched four electronic databases for studies that reported the diagnostic accuracy of HCG, AFP, and/or LDH in sufficient detail for sensitivity and specificity to be calculated by extracting a 2\u2009\u00d7\u20092 table comparing biomarker positivity with testicular cancer recurrence. Screening, data extraction and QUADAS-2 quality assessment were completed by two independent reviewers. From 2406 studies, nine met our inclusion criteria. Eight reported data at the per-patient level. Sample sizes were small (range 5 to 449 patients) and clinical heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis. In most studies the specificity for recurrence with AFP and HCG was high (90\u2013100%) but sensitivity was often relatively low, suggesting that many recurrences would not be detected by tumour markers alone. The diagnostic performance of LDH appears poorer. Studies were methodologically weak, with probable selection, incorporation and partial verification bias, and many studies were excluded for not reporting on recurrence-free patients. Limitations including small sample sizes, high heterogeneity, and inconsistent and incomplete reporting mean these results must be interpreted with caution. Despite inclusion of biomarkers in international surveillance guidance, there remains a lack of high quality evidence about their accuracy, optimal thresholds, and the most effective surveillance strategy in relation to contemporary investigative modalities. Higher quality research using data from modern-day follow-up cohorts is necessary to identify opportunities to reduce unnecessary testing.",

This study aims to synthesize available data on the burden of disease and to project the burden of cervical cancer to 2049 if no major interventions are implemented. We reviewed published data sources on risk factors for HPV prevalence, high-grade lesions, cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Vietnam from 1990 to 2017. We then used the available data to project the number of new cervical cancer cases for the period 2013\u20132049. Data on cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Vietnam are limited; two Vietnamese cancer registries have been reported on by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which cover urban populations representing \u223c20% of the national population. The reported age-standardized cervical cancer incidence in Hanoi was 6.7 (1993\u20131997), compared to 28.8 and 14.1 per 100,000 women in Ho Chi Minh City (1995\u20131998 and 2009\u20132012, respectively). Cancer mortality data are not uniformly available from cancer registries or mortality surveys in Vietnam because cause of death has not been routinely ascertained. Based on available urban population registry data, estimated rates in the rural population, and forward projection of existing trends, we estimate that without any further intervention, the number of new cases will increase from 6930 (range 5671\u20138493) in 2012 to 8562 (range 5775\u201312,762) in 2049, giving a total of 379,617 (range 276,879\u2013542,941) new cases over the period 2013\u20132049.

Soft tissue sarcomas (STS), the focus of this review, account for \u224870\u201280% of sarcomas and represent <1% of all cancers. The heterogeneity of STS applies to both their topography and morphology, and 5-year survival can vary widely depending on disease stage and the complex interplay between anatomical site and histology for different STS subtypes. The rarity and heterogeneity of STS, together with other factors, such as the lack of clinical expertise often lead to difficulties and delays in making an accurate diagnosis and to the inappropriate management of each STS subtype. Therefore, this group of cancers requires special attention and approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Epidemiological data on STS are limited, and concerns have been raised regarding accurate registration of STS in cancer registries, including issues related to details of the histotypes. This review provides an overview of the epidemiology of STS in Italy, focusing on data from the Italian Association of Cancer Registries (AIRTUM), and compares findings with those from other European countries. Based on these data, and considering that STS is among the most common group of rare cancers, the relevance of multidisciplinary care for STS patients through reference centres, clinical networks and collaborative disease-specific groups is discussed.",

Few studies have ever compared across different countries/regions to suggest possible macro-environmental risk factors of CRC. We estimated the effects of age, period and cohort on the changes of incidence of colorectal cancer across different countries/regions.Poisson regression age-period-cohort (APC) models were conducted to estimate the age, period and cohorts effects on CRC incidence across the West (i.e., the UK, the US and Australia) and Asia (i.e. Japan, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore and India). We maximized the length of the study period according to each country\u2019s data availability.Western populations show upward inflections for their 1950s\u20131960s cohorts, while Asian populations (except India) show downward inflections for their 1950s cohorts. Japanese population also shows upward inflections for its 1960s cohorts, similar to the Western populations. There are apparent upward inflections towards the more recent cohorts for Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore; nevertheless, the confidence intervals are wider towards the more recent cohorts.Our findings imply an increasing risk of CRC in both Western and Asian populations as their younger cohorts reach older ages. These findings are consistent with the life course argument that macro-environmental changes associated with socio-economic development have specific effects that extend over the life course. Actions that pertain to altering lifestyle-related exposures over the life course are of great importance in combating young CRC risks in the future.",

Appraisal intervals of > 1 month were associated with male gender, ulceration and persistent throat pain. The only symptom that associated with a help-seeking interval of > 1 week was ulceration. Participants who reported red/white patches in the mouth and ulceration were associated with a reduced likelihood of a diagnostic interval of > 3 months. A higher proportion of participants with a diagnostic interval of > 3 months were diagnosed with advanced disease (78%) than those with an interval < 3 months (68%).These data improve understanding of the intervals from first symptom recognition to HNC diagnosis and provide preliminary evidence to identify targets to reduce overall time to diagnosis.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in the Golestan province, Northern Iran. The purpose of this study is to describe colorectal cancer incidence patterns and trends in the province 2004\u20132013.Methods: Data on CRC cases were obtained from the Golestan Population-based Cancer Registry (GPCR). The GPCR is a high-quality cancer registry that collects data on primary cancers according to internationally accepted standard protocols. Age-standardized Incidence rates (ASR) were calculated and the 10-year trend quantified using the average annual percentage change (AAPC) from Joinpoint regressions.Results: The overall ASR of CRC were higher in men (14.8 per 100,000 person-years) and the urban populations (35.4), relative to women (11.5) and the rural populations (17.1), respectively. The overall incidence rate was observed to significantly increase 2004\u20132013 in men (AAPC\u2009=\u20097.3; 95%CI: 2.9\u201311.8) and women (AAPC\u2009=\u20096.6; 95%CI: 2.7\u201310.6). The analysis also showed that urban areas (AAPC\u2009=\u20098.1; 95%CI: 2.4\u201314.1) had a relatively more rapid increase in rates compared to rural areas (AAPC\u2009=\u20096.9; 95%CI: 2.2\u201311.7).Conclusions: CRC incidence rates in Golestan have been rising during the most recent decade, with a higher incidence and more rapid increases among men and the urban populations. The underlying risk factors should be assessed in the context of developing CRC prevention interventions in Golestan.",

We hypothesized that regional cancer mortality rates in Taiwan, an ethnically homogeneous society, exhibited no significant variations.We investigated the trends in Taiwan regional cancer mortality between 1992 and 2014. We analyzed regional age-standardized cancer mortality rates for lung, liver, colon, stomach, oral, breast, and prostate cancers using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database and Demographic Database. Furthermore, we applied Joinpoint regression analysis to evaluate the trends across different regions.There are clear regional variations in mortality rates for liver, stomach, and oral cancers, but not for lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancers. The regional death rates of oral cancer, especially for eastern Taiwan, not only elevate the fastest (APC\u2009=\u200914.78% per year, P\u2009<\u20090.001) but also show the largest disparities between men and women. Regional death rates for stomach cancer, which declined most rapidly, are converging in both general and gender groups. Liver cancer is the only one with regional variations whose trends do not all go in the same direction. We also demonstrated that northern Taiwan has significant regional advantages with respect to cancer mortality.Some but not all cancers in Taiwan show regional disparities. Liver, stomach, and oral cancers in Taiwan exhibit clear regional variations in mortality rates. In particular, the regional variations in oral cancer mortality rates are consistent with those in alcohol consumption.",

Projecting the future burden of cancer in Canada is essential for health planning and evaluation. We aimed to estimate the future incidence of cancer in Canada to 2042.Age-sex-region-specific cancer incidence data were obtained for the years 1983-2012 and cancer incidence was projected from 2013 to 2042 for the top five cancer sites. The modelling algorithm combined a mixture of cancer projection methods to select the best-fitted model. When the chosen model produced by the modelling algorithm resulted in estimates that were not consistent with expert opinion, an alternate model was selected that took into consideration historical changes in policy, screening and lifestyle behaviours. Incidence projections were made for Canada and its provinces.Lung cancer incidence is estimated to rise to 14,866 cases in men and 19,162 in women in 2042. Colorectal cancer incidence is estimated to rise to 28,146 in men and 21,102 in women. Cases of bladder cancer are projected to rise to 10,708 and 3,364 in men and women, respectively. Breast cancer incidence is predicted to rise to 40,712 and prostate cancer incidence is projected to rise to 92,949.These cancer incidence projections up to 2042 can be used for planning cancer control strategies and prevention programs. Given the ongoing changes in the prevalence of risk factors and in cancer prevention policies, these estimates should be interpreted with caution.",

Our aim was to describe, for the first time, the distribution of cases by stage at diagnosis and differences in stage-specific survival on a population basis for a range of childhood solid cancers in Australia.The study cohort was drawn from the population-based Australian Childhood Cancer Registry and comprised children (<15 years) diagnosed with one of 12 solid malignancies between 2006 and 2014. Stage at diagnosis was assigned according to the Toronto Paediatric Cancer Stage Guidelines. Observed (all cause) survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with follow-up on mortality available to 31 December 2015.Almost three-quarters (1256 of 1760 cases, 71%) of children in the study had localised or regional disease at diagnosis, varying from 43% for neuroblastoma to 99% for retinoblastoma.

Crude (CR) and age-specific (ASR) rates of MM incidence were determined. Age-adjusted rates (AARs) were estimated by standardizing the CR values using age-specific weights recommended for LMIC countries (including India) for men and women separately, along with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) measures.Altogether, 1916\u2009MM cases (male/female: 1123/793) were documented (i.e. 1.19% of all cancers, 95% CI: 1.14\u20131.24%). Overall CR of MM in India was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.20\u20131.35)/ 100,000 in men and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.89\u20131.02)/ 100,000 in women, while the corresponding AARs were 1.13 (95% CI: 1.07\u20131.20) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.75 \u2013 0.88) per 100,000 respectively. The ASR values increased steadily with age. Most cases belonged to the 60\u201369 yrs bracket. However, regional and sex-specific differences in MM profile were observed.

It is not clear whether changes in the population at risk (women with intact uteruses) have contributed to an increased uterine cancer incidence. This study aims to assess the effect of changing trends in hysterectomy prevalence on uterine cancer incidence in Scotland.The population of women aged \u226525 years with intact uteri was estimated using the estimated hysterectomy prevalence in 1995 and the number of procedures performed in Scotland (1996\u20132015). Age-standardized uterine cancer incidence was estimated using uncorrected (total) or corrected (adjusted for hysterectomy prevalence) populations as denominators and the number of incident cancers as numerators. Annual percentage change in uterine cancer was estimated.Hysterectomy prevalence fell from 13% to 10% between 1996\u20132000 and 2011\u20132015, with the most marked decline (from 20% to 6%) in the 50\u201354-year age group. After correction for hysterectomy prevalence, age-standardized incidence of uterine cancer increased by 20\u201322%. Annual percentage change in incidence of uterine cancer remained stable through the study period and was 2.2% (95%CI 1.8\u20132.7) and 2.1% (95%CI 1.7\u20132.6) for uncorrected and corrected estimates, respectively.Uterine cancer incidence in Scotland corrected for hysterectomy prevalence is higher than estimates using a total female population as denominator. The annual percentage increase in uterine cancer incidence was stable in both uncorrected and corrected populations despite a declining hysterectomy prevalence. The rise in uterine cancer incidence may thus be driven by other factors, including an ageing population, changing reproductive choices, and obesity.",

Data extraction was performed from 26\u2009GP practices and from the database of the University of P\u00e9cs Clinical Center. Total Diagnostic Interval (TDI) was determined as the number of days from the first patient-physician consultation with symptoms until the pathologically confirmed date of diagnosis. Total Treatment Interval (TTI) was calculated until the first day of any form of treatment. Statistical analyses, descriptive analysis and analysis of variance, were performed.A minority (36.8%) of the diagnosed CRC cases were early stage cancers (Stages I-II), while the majority (59.9%) of the cases were diagnosed as advanced stage (Stages III-IV) cancers. The median TDI was 41 days, and the median TTI was 67 days. There was a wide range between minimum and maximum waiting times regarding both diagnosis and initiation of therapy (369\u2013371 days).Wait times to diagnosis and treatment of CRC in Hungary are similar to Western countries however the ratio of advanced cancers at diagnosis is higher. The cause of late diagnosis may be due to patient delay, indicating the need for implementation of primary and secondary prevention.",

In this study, we used more recent, state-specific data to investigate the county-level determinants of geographic variation in NC through a geospatial analytic approach.Using NC CRC mortality data from 2003 to 2013, we first conducted clustering analysis to confirm spatial dependence. Spatial economic models were then used to incorporate spatial structure to estimate the association between determinants and CRC mortality. We included county-level data on socio-demographic characteristics, access and quality of healthcare, behavioral risk factors (CRC screening, obesity, and cigarette smoking), and urbanicity. Due to correlation among screening, obesity and quality of healthcare, we combined these factors to form a cumulative risk group variable in the analysis.We confirmed the existence of spatial dependence and identified clusters of elevated CRC mortality rates in NC counties. Using a spatial lag model, we found significant interaction effect between CRC risk groups and socioeconomic deprivation. Higher CRC mortality rates were also associated with rural counties with large towns compared to urban counties.Our findings depicted a spatial diffusion process of CRC mortality rates across NC counties, demonstrated intertwined effects between SES deprivation and behavioral risks in shaping CRC mortality at area-level, and identified counties with high CRC mortality that were also deprived in multiple factors. These results suggest interventions to reduce geographic variation in CRC mortality should develop multifaceted strategies and work through shared resources in neighboring areas.",

Furthermore, biochemical assays illustrated that rs3750050 could impair the inhibitory effect of PTPN12 on Ras/MEK/ERK signaling by impeding SHC dephosphorylation, increase the expression of cyclin D1 and ultimately lead to aberrant cell proliferation, thus contributing to CRC pathogenesis.Our study highlights that PTPN12 rs3750050 could increase CRC risk by modifying Ras/MEK/ERK signaling. This work provides a novel insight into the roles of genetic variants within PTP genes in the pathogenesis of CRC.",

We estimated the proportion of cancer cases and deaths that could be potentially avoided by eliminating or reducing lifestyle risk factors in Brazil.We obtained the distribution of lifestyle risk factors by sex and age groups from recent representative health surveys in Brazil; relative risks from pooled analyses of prospective studies and meta-analyses; and cancer cases and deaths in 2012 from GLOBOCAN.We found that 26.5% (114,497 cases) of all cancer cases and 33.6% (63,371 deaths) of all cancer deaths could be potentially avoided by eliminating lifestyle risk factors in Brazil. Plausible reductions in these exposures based on policy targets and cancer prevention recommendations could have potentially avoided 4.5% (19,731 cases) and 6.1% (11,480 deaths) of all cancer cases and deaths, respectively. Tobacco smoking accounted for most of the preventable cancer cases and deaths, followed by high body mass index and alcohol consumption. Larynx, lung, oropharynx, esophagus and colorectum cancer cases and deaths could be at least halved by eliminating these lifestyle risk factors.Findings from this study may be useful to inform strategies for cancer prevention and control across Brazil.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to energy restriction during childhood is associated with a lower risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). To date, the association between this critical period of growth and prognosis of CRC has rarely been investigated. Changes in microbiota and epigenetic dysregulation may be key underlying mechanisms.Tissues collected from patients born between 1956 and 1964 were grouped based on time-period. The differences in overall survival among patients from the three time-periods were examined via univariate analysis. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach was to determine differences in microbiota among the groups. Samples were randomly selected to detect BRAF mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI) and promoter CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status. The chi-square test was to assess the relationship between alterations in these molecules and microbiota differences.Patients from the three groups differed in terms of location of CRC (P\u2009=\u20090.034) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level (P\u2009=\u20090.036). A survival advantage was observed in the famine group compared with the other two groups. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli were more abundant in the two comparing groups. Abundance of B. fragilis was associated with BRAF mutations, microsatellite instability (MSI) and abundance of E. coli. Moreover, the incidence of CIMP and MSI was higher in patients with greater abundance of F. nucleatum.Limitation of energy intake during childhood may affect the composition of gut microbiota, resulting in persistent epigenetic changes that subsequently influence the prognosis of patients with CRC.",

Patients (n\u2009=\u20096834) diagnosed between 01/2009 and 08/2015 are included; DLBCL (n\u2009=\u20091771), myeloma (n\u2009=\u20091760), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, n\u2009=\u20091580), MZL (n\u2009=\u2009936), and follicular lymphoma (FL, n\u2009=\u2009787).

All women received colposcopy with biopsies taken at abnormal sites. Histopathological diagnoses were used as the gold standard.Results p16/Ki-67 staining had a positivity rate of 43.58% overall; the rate increased significantly with histological severity (p <0.001). The sensitivities of p16/ki-67 for detecting CIN2+ and CIN3+ were 88.10% and 91.30%, respectively. Compared with high-risk HPV (HR-HPV), sensitivity of p16/Ki-67 was lower for detecting CIN2+ (88.10% versus 95.71%), but similar for detecting CIN3+ (91.30% versus 96.27%). Specificities of p16/Ki-67 were 85.02% for detecting CIN2+ and 76.86% for detecting CIN3+, values similar to those for LBC (84.71% for CIN2+, 80.05% for CIN3+) but higher than those for HR-HPV (62.77% for CIN2+, 71.25% for CIN3+). All the tests performed better in women>30 years. With respect to the performance of triage for women with ASC-US, sensitivities of p16/Ki-67 were 86.36% for detecting CIN2+ and 83.33% for detecting CIN3+, values similar to those of HR-HPV. However, specificities of p16/Ki-67 were both higher than those of HR-HPV (85.96% versus 67.54% for CIN2+, 79.84% versus 62.90% for CIN3+).Conclusion P16/Ki-67 dual staining could probably provide an optional method for China\u2019s national cervical cancer screening, and could also be considered as an efficient method of triage for managing women with ASC-US.",

The aim of this population-based cohort study was to investigate this hypothesis in mesothelioma, using national data from a high incidence country.Case records for all patients with mesothelioma seen in English hospitals between 01/01/2005 and 31/12/2014 were extracted from Hospital Episode Statistics using International Classification of Diseases Tenth Edition (ICD-10) codes. Episodes of pleural infection were identified. Linked mortality data was obtained from the Office of National Statistics.The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. The explanatory variable was pleural infection. Cox proportional hazards model was used to analyse survival, with pleural infection, chemotherapy and thoracic surgery handled as time-variable co-factors.Of 22,215 patients with mesothelioma, 512 (2.3%) developed pleural infection at some point in their illness. Overall median survival was 7.0 months (IQR 2.3\u201316.4). Pleural infection was associated with shorter survival in the immediate post-infection period (up to 30 days \u2013 HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.45\u20132.22) and longer term (>30 days \u2013 HR 1.81, 95% CI 1.63\u20131.99). Other factors associated with increased mortality were age, male gender and being diagnosed as an inpatient. Receiving chemotherapy and being less economically deprived were associated with longer survival.Pleural infection occurred in 2.3% of people with mesothelioma and was associated with shorter survival. This refutes previous reports suggesting pleural infection may be associated with better outcomes in thoracic malignancy.",

We aimed to determine the underlying cause of death among Danish men with prostate cancer, to estimate the level of misattribution of prostate cancer death, and to examine the risk of death from prostate cancer when accounting for competing risk of death.We investigated a nationwide cohort of 15,878 prostate cancer patients diagnosed in 2010\u20132014; with 3343 deaths occurring through 2016. Blinded medical chart review was carried out for 670 deaths and compared to the national cause of death registry. Five death categories were defined: 1) prostate cancer-specific death, 2) other unspecified urological cancer death, 3) other cancer death 4) cardiovascular disease death, and 5) other causes of death. Competing risk analyses compared Cox cause-specific and Fine-Gray regression models.Chart review attributed 51.2% of deaths to prostate cancer, 17.0% to cardiovascular disease, and 16.7% to other causes. The Danish Register of Causes of Death attributed 71.7% of deaths to prostate cancer when including all registered contributing causes of death, and 57.0% of deaths when including only the primary registered cause of death. The probability of death by prostate cancer was 10% at 2-year survival.More than half of the deceased men in our study cohort died of their prostate cancer disease within a mean of 2.4 years of follow up. Data from the death registry is prone to misclassification, potentially overestimating the proportion of deaths from prostate cancer.",

     "abstract": "Population-based registries are increasingly used in cancer research. In such studies, cancer-specific mortality or survival is frequently used as the primary outcome. To determine whether a putative cancer was part of the causal chain of events leading to death, cancer registries primarily rely on death certificates. Hence, they depend on the subjective interpretation of information available to medical examiners at the time of death. Misclassification may occur: studies report misclassification of cancer as a cause of death in 15%\u201335% of death certificates based on evaluation by expert panels and/or autopsy reports. Further misclassification may occur when coding death causes in the cancer registry. Researchers should be aware of potential misclassification bias when using cancer registry data. Differential misclassification may bias the results towards or away from the null hypothesis, depending on whether there is relative over- or under-reporting of cancer-related deaths in one group. Strategies to improve reporting of cancer-specific survival/mortality include (1) describing the procedure used to identify cancer-specific deaths; (2) considering the use of multiple definitions of cancer-related deaths (strict/liberal definitions of cancer-specific deaths, and/or addition of relative survival as an outcome); and (3) reporting cancer-specific survival/mortality together with the objectively measured parameters overall survival or all-cause mortality.",

Two reviewers independently selected studies based on predefined inclusion criteria and assessed study quality using the Newcastle-Otawa scale. The data was combined with the random effects model. Potential heterogeneity was calculated as Q statistic and I2 value. A total of 23 studies involving more than 1 million subjects contributed to the analysis. Pooled odds ratio (OR) of NA-NSAIDs effects on CRC risk was 0.74 (0.67-0.81), I2\u2009=\u200975.9%, p\u2009<\u20090.001. Heterogeneity was explained by a number of variables including the quality of the studies. Significant protective effects of NA-NSAIDs use were found for women (risk reduction of 19%), higher doses (risk reduction of 18%), distal colon cancer (risk reduction of 22%) and white people (risk reduction from 31% to 41%).

With a slim chance of early diagnosis, surgery can only provide a median survival of 17\u201323 months. The presence of a dense stroma makes this cancer resilient to chemotherapy, with very few potent inhibitors like nab paclitaxelin available that can work in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. Survival rates, on the one hand, lie at 8.5%. Variation in types of pancreatic cancer, on the other hand, makes it notoriously difficult to come up with a practical solution for the treatment of this disease. A deeper understanding of the root cause would be beneficial for diagnosis. Advancement in the field of genomics has made the identification of novel biomarkers relatively easier. By coupling this factor with the production of suitable inhibitors, testing in large numbers can be made possible with the help of cell lines. With the combined efforts of biological knowledge and modern technology, the cure for pancreatic cancer could be at hand.",

     "abstract": "Oral cancer is one of the leading cancers in South-Asian countries. Despite the easy access of the oral cavity, the detection and five year survival rates of OSCC patients are dismal. Identification of non-invasive biomarkers to determine the progression and recurrence of OSCC could be of immense help to patients. Recent studies on oral cancer suggest the importance of non-invasive biomarker development. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are one of the important components of the cell-free nucleic acids available in different body fluids. Here, we have reviewed the current understanding of circulating miRNAs as non-invasive biomarkers in different body fluids of oral cancer patients. A number of circulating miRNAs are found to be common in the body fluids of OSCC patients, while many of these are study specific, the possible sources of this variability could be due to differences in sample processing, assay procedure, clinical stage of the disease, oral habit and environmental factors. The prognostic and therapeutic significance of these circulating miRNAs are suggested by several studies. Mir-371, mir-150, mir-21 and mir-7d were found to be potential prognostic markers, while mir-134, mir-146a, mir-338 and mir-371 were associated with metastases. The prognostic markers, mir-21 and mir-7d were also found to be significantly correlated with resistance to chemotherapy, while mir-375, mir-196 and mir-125b were significantly correlated with sensitivity to radiotherapy. Despite the promising roles of circulating miRNAs, challenges still remain in unravelling the exact regulation of these miRNAs before using them for targeted therapy.",

NHB with HR+/HER2- (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.22, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.42) and Hispanics with HR-/HER2- (aOR 1.62, 95% CI 1.15\u20132.28) were more likely to receive chemotherapy than their NHW counterparts. Both NHB and Hispanics were more likely to receive delayed chemotherapy than NHW, and the pattern was consistent across each subtype. No racial/ethnic differences were found in the receipt of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.Compared to NHW with the same subtype, NHB with HR+/HER2- and Hispanics with HR-/HER2- have higher odds of using chemotherapy; however, they are more likely to receive delayed chemotherapy, regardless of subtype. Whether the increased chemotherapy use among NHB with HR+/HER2- indicates overtreatment needs further investigation.

In contrast, for breast cancer mortality, Hawaii has the 3rd lowest rate in the nation, with rates demonstrating a steady decline for nearly 3 decades.We examined incidence and mortality trends from 1984\u20132013 across the five major racial/ethnic populations of Hawaii (Native Hawaiian, White, Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino) using Hawaii\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry data.With the exception of Chinese, all groups experienced increasing incidence over the thirty year period. While Japanese experienced the most pronounced recent increase, with incidence now exceeding that of Whites, their mortality rates have remained low for decades. Native Hawaiians have consistently had the highest incidence and mortality rates in the state. The incidence rates of hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer were higher among Japanese and Native Hawaiians as compared to Whites. Relative to Whites, Native Hawaiians also had a higher incidence rate of the HER2-positive subtype and, Japanese, of the triple-negative (HR-/HER2-) subtype of breast cancer.Studies such as this underscore the importance of considering the heterogeneity in breast cancer rates and subtypes across the different racial/ethnic populations.",

We fitted linear regression to the natural logarithm of the estimated incidence rates of various cancer registries in India.Burden of cancer in India increased from 0.6 million in 1991 to 1.4 million in 2015. Among males, common cancers are lung (12.0%), mouth (11.4%), prostate (7.0%), and tongue (7.0%) and among females, they are breast (21.0%), cervix-uteri (12.1%), ovary (6.9%), and lung (4.9%) in 2012. Increased life-expectancy and population growth as well as increased use of alcohol and increased prevalence of overweight/obesity reflected an increase in all cancers in both genders except a reduction in infection-related cancers such as cervix-uteri and tobacco-related cancers such as pharynx (excludes nasopharynx) and oesophagus.Transition in demographics and epidemiologic risk factors, reflected an increase in all cancers in both genders except a reduction in a few cancers. The increasing incidence of cancer and its associated factors demands a planned approach to reduce its burden. The burden assessment needs to be strengthened by increasing the population coverage of cancer registries. Continued effort for tobacco prevention and public health efforts for reducing obesity and alcohol consumption are needed to reduce the cancer burden.",

     "abstract": "Objective: To investigate an association between maternal prenatal exposure to several environmental factors and risk of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and the possible interactions in the Chinese population.Methods: 345 cases with ALL and their 1:1 age, gender, residence region matched controls aged 0\u201315 years were recruited from four hospitals in Henan Province from 2014 to 2016. Information was collected by interviews using a questionnaire. Unconditional logistic regression adjusted for age, gender, residence region and relevant confounders was carried out to generate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results: Our data indicate that maternal prenatal exposure to interior housing renovation (adjusted OR: 2.98, 95% CI: 1.51\u20135.86) or pesticides (adjusted OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.67\u20132.28) increased the risk of childhood ALL. Various subgroup analyses stratified by child's gender, age at diagnosis and other factors also supported these results. However, no interaction was detected between exposure to internal housing renovation and pesticides using an additive model. No significant links between maternal exposures to, environmental tobacco smoking (ETS), antipyretic analgesia intake, or viral infectious diseases with risk of ALL were detected.Conclusion: Findings in our study are in line with the existing literatures, which support the hypothesis that maternal prenatal exposure to interior housing renovation and pesticides are risk factors for childhood ALL. Notably, we found no interaction between these two risk factors, these findings may inform prevention and early detection strategies.",

We aimed to identify factors associated with racial differences in ovarian cancer treatment and overall survival (OS).We examined data from 365 white and 95 black ovarian cancer patients from the Hollings Cancer Center Cancer Registry in Charleston, S.C. between 2000 and 2015. We used unconditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between race and receipt of surgery and chemotherapy, and Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs between race and OS. Model variables included diagnosis center, stage, histology, insurance status, smoking, age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (AACI) and residual disease.

These are preferred as a wide range of hazard shapes can be captured using splines to model the log-cumulative hazard function and can include time-dependent effects for more flexibility. An important issue is the number of knots used for splines. The reliability of estimates are assessed using English data for 10 cancer types and the use of online interactive graphs to enable a more comprehensive sensitivity analysis at the control of the user is demonstrated.Sixty FPMs were fitted to each cancer type with varying degrees of freedom to model the baseline excess hazard and the main and time-dependent effect of age. For each model, we obtained age-specific, age-group and internally age-standardised relative survival estimates. The Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion were also calculated and comparative estimates were obtained using the Ederer II and Pohar Perme methods. Web-based interactive graphs were developed to present results.Age-standardised estimates were very insensitive to the exact number of knots for the splines. Age-group survival is also stable with negligible differences between models. Age-specific estimates are less stable especially for the youngest and oldest patients, of whom there are very few, but for most scenarios perform well.Although estimates do not depend heavily on the number of knots, too few knots should be avoided, as they can result in a poor fit. Interactive graphs engage researchers in assessing model sensitivity to a wide range of scenarios and their use is highly encouraged.",

A subsequent ethical review removed this requirement and allowed an analysis of consented and non-consented patients. Kaplan-Meier survival to 10 years (mean follow-up 5.1 years, maximum 13.9 years), demographic and clinical characteristics were compared.

Analyses based only on consenting patients overestimate survival in all patients by around 2% at 2, 5, and 10 years. Non-consented patients were older, more often of Pacific ethnicity, had fewer screen-detected cancers, and more often had metastatic disease; they less frequently had primary surgery or systemic treatments.Data from a registry requiring active consent gives an upward bias in survival results, as non-consenting patients have more extensive disease, less treatment, and lower survival.

Sensitivity analyses estimated their impact on one-year survival using baseline and supplementary cancer registration data from England and Sweden.Variations in registration practice accounted for up to a 7.3 percentage point difference between unadjusted (estimates from previous ICBP survival data) and adjusted (estimates recalculated accounting for registration differences) one-year survival, depending on tumour site and jurisdiction.One-year survival estimates for four jurisdictions were affected by adjustment: New South Wales, Norway, Ontario, Sweden.

Children who refused or abandoned therapy were tracked, and reasons for refusal/abandonment were recorded by telephone interviews or by surface mail. Sociodemographic parameters were compared using chi-square/Student t-test to identify predictors of refusal/abandonment.Treatment refusal was noted in 16.8% (96/572) of children with ALL; it was statistically higher for infants (p\u2009=\u20090.004), girls (p\u2009=\u20090.04), children of parents with poor literacy (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and those of lower socioeconomic status (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Main causes of treatment refusal were financial constraints (59.4%) and a misplaced belief about the incurability of cancer (22.9%). Therapy once started, was abandoned by 139/476 children (29.2%), the majority (41%) during induction, followed by maintenance (17.9%). Major reasons for abandonment were financial constraints (34.5%), false perception of cure (20%), poor general condition of the child (15%), no improvement in the child (13%), and blood donation refusal (3%). The reasons cited were different in different treatment phases. Abandonment was statistically higher in children from rural background (p\u2009<\u20090.001) or lower socioeconomic status (p\u2009<\u20090.001), and in those with fathers having a lower literacy status (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Low hemoglobin (p\u2009=\u20090.01) and severe wasting (p\u2009=\u20090.01) was greater in children who abandoned treatment.Treatment refusal or abandonment, noted in 40% of children, was due mainly to monetary difficulties, disbeliefs regarding curability, or false perceptions of cure; these factors need to be addressed to improve survival, particularly in children from rural areas and those of parents with a lower literacy status.",

Previous studies have shown increased risks in patients with melanoma of developing RCC and in those with RCC of developing melanoma. However, data regarding immunocompromised status in these patients are lacking.Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who had a diagnosis of melanoma and/or RCC. Using summary statistics, we calculated total person-years at risk for developing melanoma among patients with RCC and for developing RCC among patients with melanoma, and compared the results with the SEER data. We also assessed medical history related to immune status and the use of immunosuppressive drugs.Results: Among 13,879 patients with melanoma and 7597 patients with RCC, 89 had diagnoses of both melanoma and RCC (0.6% and 1.2% of melanoma and RCC patients, respectively): eight were diagnosed with both cancers concurrently, 54 were diagnosed with melanoma first, and 27 were diagnosed with RCC first. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were 2.87 (95%CI 2.16\u20133.74) for developing RCC among the melanoma patients and 2.31 (95%CI 1.52\u20133.37) for developing melanoma among the RCC patients, compared to age-, sex-, race-, and calendar-specific adjusted incidence rates of each cancer in the SEER registry. None of the 81 patients with sequential diagnoses had a history of immunocompromised disease, nor did they receive chronic immunosuppressive drugs. Only two received chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.Conclusion: We demonstrated a strong association between the diagnoses of melanoma and RCC. These increased risks could not be attributed to either immune status or previous antineoplastic treatment.",

Trends in age-standardised mortality rates (ASR, world standard), and age-specific rates were analysed by calculating annual percentage change (APC) using Joinpoint regression. In addition, age-period-cohort analysis was performed.Joinpoint regression analysis indicated that mortality from cervical cancer increased by 2.0% (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9) annually from 1987 to 2002 and decreased by 2.3% (95% CI: 3.2, 1.3) annually thereafter.

For older women mortality rates moderately declined during the entire time span.

Therefore, a contemporary, comprehensive apprehension on patient-, disease-, and treatment-specific characteristics of elderly AML patients at the population level can inform treatment choices and facilitate increased patient accrual in upcoming RCTs.In this population-based study, we investigated patient- and disease-specific characteristics in elderly AML patients, and their association with treatment and survival.We retrospectively obtained data on all over 65-year-old AML patients diagnosed between 2010\u20132013 in the referral area of two university hospitals in the Netherlands. Multivariable analyses were performed to assess factors associated with treatment choice and overall survival.Of all 356 patients, 77% received non-intensive therapy (NIT), and 15% and 8% received ICT within and outside a RCT, respectively. Cytogenetic (74%) and molecular (93%) analyses were not performed in most NIT recipients. Age and comorbidity were independently associated with NIT, whereas only comorbidity was associated with decreased trial participation. The adjusted risk of mortality among ICT recipients was not influenced by trial participation status.The application of ICT and accrual to RCTs remains staggeringly low in an elderly AML population. Since survival of ICT-treated patients was not affected by trial participation status, exclusion criteria might be relaxed in upcoming RCTs. Furthermore, appropriate management strategies can be accomplished by comprehensive comorbidity assessment and augmented genetic prognostication.",

Previous reports of cancer incidence projections have often been deterministic, i.e. lacking quantification of uncertainty. We project cancer incidence in Germany by applying an approach that allows for probabilistic interpretation of outcomes.German cancer registry data from 1999 to 2013 are used to predict cancer incidence for 27 sites until the year 2030. We apply Bayesian Poisson and negative binomial models to obtain probabilistic estimates of future site-, year-, sex- and age-specific cancer incidence rates. Results from cancer incidence models are combined with probabilistic population projections to estimate numbers of incident cancer cases. Comparisons of overall and stratum-specific cancer incidence rates and case numbers are made between the years 2015 and 2030 by estimating absolute and relative change along with uncertainty intervals.The overall standardized incidence rate is expected to increase by 5% (95%-credible interval: 0%, 13%) until 2030. Incident case numbers are expected to increase by 23% (95%-credible interval: 17%, 29%) which is mostly driven by demographic change. The probability (expressed as %) that the change will be >10%, >20% or >30% was calculated to be >99%, 66% and 7%, respectively.The analysis provides evidence on the future cancer burden in Germany by applying a fully Bayesian approach that offers advantages in terms of flexibility, probabilistic interpretability, and transparency.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate Hazard Ratios [HRs] and 95% confidence interval [CI] of total and site-specific SPC and mortality adjusting for demographic and cancer related characteristics.The SPC risk associated with radiotherapy was higher among ever-smokers than never-smokers (p for interaction\u2009=\u20090.04).

     "abstract": "Aims: This population-based historical cohort study examined whether poor glycemic-control (i.e., high glucose and HbA1c blood levels) in patients with diabetes is associated with cancer-risk.Methods: From a large healthcare database, patients aged 21\u201389 years, diagnosed with diabetes before January 2002 (prevalent) or during 2002\u20132010 (incident), were followed for cancer during 2004\u20132012 (excluding cancers diagnosed within the first 2 years since diabetes diagnosis). Risks of selected cancers (all-sites, colon, breast, lung, prostate, pancreas and liver) were estimated according to glycemic-control in a Cox regression model with time-dependent covariates, adjusted for age, sex, ethnic origin, socioeconomic status, smoking and parity. Missing glucose or HbA1c values were imputed.Results: Among 440,000 patients included in our analysis, cancer was detected more than 2 years after diabetes diagnosis in 26,887 patients (6%) during the follow-up period. Associations of poor glycemic-control with all-sites cancer and most specific cancers were either null or only weak (hazard ratios (HRs) for a 1% HbA1c or a 30\u2009mg/dl glucose increase between 0.94 and 1.09). Exceptions were pancreatic cancer, for which there was a strong positive association (HRs: 1.26\u20131.51), and prostate cancer, for which there was a moderate negative association (HRs: 0.85\u20130.96).Conclusion: Overall, poor glycemic-control appears to be only weakly associated with cancer-risk, if at all. A substantial part of the positive association with pancreatic cancer is attributable to reverse causation, with the cancer causing poorer glycemic-control prior to its diagnosis. The negative association with prostate cancer may be related to lower PSA levels in those with poor control.",

Axial (OR\u2009=\u20092.31, 95% CI: 1.58\u20133.37) and \u201cother\u201d (OR\u2009=\u20092.35, 95% CI: 1.15\u20134.81) tumor locations had more than twice the likelihood of presenting with metastatic disease, compared to extremity tumor sites. Increasing tumor size conferred up to a three-fold increase in odds of metastatic disease (pTrend <0.001).Advanced age, axial tumor location, and increasing tumor size are associated with increased odds of detectable metastatic disease upon presentation with EFT. Although these characteristics are not modifiable, they provide objective factors that may inform patient counseling of metastatic risk.",

Whenever the European Guidelines provided a desirable level for a performance indicator, the Danish National Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme was close to or above this desirable level.Compared to the European Guidelines, all performance indicators were above the acceptable level and close to the desirable level. Based on these findings, the implementation of the National Danish Colorectal Cancer Screening Programme is considered a success and the programme is hopefully in the process of reducing colorectal cancer morbidity and mortality in Denmark.This study provides relevant information for comparisons to other population-based public service colorectal cancer screening programmes as well as for future revisions of guidelines.",

The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of the adult population at high risk of developing lung cancer in the EU in 2014.Methods This is a cross-sectional study. We used data from the Special Eurobarometer 429 (n\u2009=\u200927,801). The fieldwork was conducted between November-December 2014. High risk of lung cancer was defined using the criteria of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the Dutch-Belgian Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON).Results One out of ten smokers (11.6% of men and 9.6% of women) according to NLST criteria and one out of four smokers (24.6% of men and 22.4% of women) according to NELSON criteria are currently at high risk of lung cancer in the EU. According to both criteria, the prevalence of former smokers at high risk of lung cancer is under 10%.Conclusion Around 17 million citizens in the EU according to NLST criteria and 34 million according to NELSON criteria (around 4% and 8% of the adult population, respectively) are at high risk of developing lung cancer. Since the implementation of lung cancer screening programs still remains controversial, primary prevention activities should be encouraged.",

Birth defect status (DS, other birth defects, or no birth defects) was determined by linking with birth defects data. Associations between birth defect status and demographic characteristics were evaluated using contingency table analysis. Ten-year survival was calculated by birth defect status and other potential prognostic factors. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was also performed.Among 2941 ALL children, 1.6% had DS, 3.8% had other birth defects, and 94.5% had no birth defects. Birth defect status was significantly associated with age at ALL diagnosis. Survivals were similar among three groups. Among 563 AML children, 11.0% had DS, 6.0% had other birth defects, and 83.0% had no birth defects. Children with DS were more likely to be diagnosed with AML at a younger age and showed the best survival.Age at leukemia diagnosis was significantly associated with the birth defect status. Comparable survival was observed for ALL children. However, AML children with DS demonstrated superior survival compared to children with other birth defects or no birth defects.",

This study aims to examine trends in the uptake of EGFR mutation testing in patients with non-squamous NSCLC in New Zealand; to develop a composite metric that quantifies the influences of demographic and clinico-pathological factors on the testing uptake; and to estimate the prevalence of EGFR mutation if all patients were tested.This population-based study involved all patients who were diagnosed with non-squamous NSCLC in four health regions in New Zealand between January 2010 and December 2015. Eligible patients were identified from the New Zealand Cancer Registry and information on EGFR mutation testing was obtained through linkage to TestSafe, a clinical information sharing service, and laboratory records.Of 2701 eligible patients, 1059 (39.2%) were tested for EGFR mutation. The testing prevalence increased (3.7% in 2010 to 64.6% in 2014) and the influences of demographic and clinic-pathological factors decreased from 2010 to June 2014, and remained stable afterward. Of the tested patients, 229 (21.6%) were mutation positive with a decreasing trend observed from 2010 (43.8%) to June 2014 (16.8%).

Cases were recruited at endoscopy and controls from hospital wards, age and gender frequency-matched to cases. Urine, toenails, blood and tumour biopsy were collected and a questionnaire administered.During this pilot phase, 143 cases and 155 controls were successfully recruited. Complete questionnaire data was obtained through e-data collection. Biospecimen collection was possible with support of an already existing equipped laboratory. We introduce changes made in the main study phase, including on expansion of the control groups to allow to consideration of selection bias.Extra attention and funding to train and monitor data quality and biospecimen collection and collaboration of a large group held together by strong leadership are essential. We recommend studies based on regional treatment centres with their more defined catchment areas rather than in the capital cities as referral routes in multi-level health care systems are severely attrition prone.",

Different modeling methods can be used to represent the complex dynamics of clinical practice; the choice of which may impact cost-effectiveness outcomes. We compare the use of a previously designed cohort discrete-time state-transition model (DT-STM) with a discrete event simulation (DES) model.The original DT-STM was replicated and a DES model developed using AnyLogic software. Models were populated using individual patient data of a phase III study in metastatic colorectal cancer patients, and compared based on their evidence structure, internal validity, and cost-effectiveness outcomes. The DT-STM used time-dependent transition probabilities, whereas the DES model was populated using parametric distributions.The estimated time-dependent transition probabilities for the DT-STM were irregular and more sensitive to single events due to the required small cycle length and limited number of event observations, whereas parametric distributions resulted in smooth time-to-event curves for the DES model. Although the DT-STM and DES model both yielded similar time-to-event curves, the DES model represented the trial data more accurately in terms of mean health-state durations. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was \u20ac172,443 and \u20ac168,383 per Quality Adjusted Life Year gained for the DT-STM and DES model, respectively.DES represents time-to-event data from clinical trials more naturally and accurately than DT-STM when few events are observed per time cycle.

Based on observations of the incidence and survival up to 2010, different scenarios for evolution up to 2017 were studied, combining stable and dynamic incidence and survival. The determinants of variations in prevalence (incidence, survival and demography) were quantified.At the end of 2017, an estimated 1,396,000 men and 1,359,000 women having had cancer in the previous 15 years were alive, respectively 5.4% and 4.8% of the population. Twelve percent had been diagnosed in the preceding year and 23% between 10 and 15 years. Between 2010 and 2017, changes in incidence and survival depended on the cancer site. The effect of the demographic change was null for those under age 65, whereas above age 65, the contribution of this factor was 20% in men and 17% in women at 15 years. The different projection scenarios led to very different estimates for some cancers for which incidence strongly varied in the last decades.Prevalent cases are numerous in a country such as France, where incidence and survival are high. Due to the sensitivity of prevalence to changes in incidence and survival, we recommend that the results of projections are presented under different scenarios. We propose a robust and flexible prevalence estimate.",

Favorable WHO-grade (Gleason-Score) was present in 75.4% and 60.7% of cT1 and cT2 patients, 74.3% and 56.5% of SI and SII patients, and 86.1%,85.6%,73.3% and 29.5% of PSG I, IIA, IIB and\u2009\u2265\u2009IIC (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Probability of BFS was 92.0% and 91.5% for cT1 and cT2 (p\u2009=\u20090.990), 91.1% and 94.2% for SI and S II (p\u2009=\u20090.286) and 96.6%,95.1%,91.4% and 78.8% for PSG I,IIA,IIB and\u2009\u2265\u2009IIC (p\u2009=\u20090.001).CT 1/cT2 and S I/II subgrouping is feasible to predict a different pT-category and a favorable WHO-grade (Gleason-Score) after RP, but failed to predict a different BFS. With the additional information of WHO-grade (Gleason-Score) and PSA, the PSG represents an approach for the prediction of all examined endpoints which is a useful tool to help clinicians to advise their patients.",

There was large geographical survival variability, mainly for bone tumours, and survival decreased with increasing age at diagnosis.Data from 87 population-based cancer registries in 29 countries, extracted from the EUROCARE-5 database, were used to provide updated estimates of survival and describe trends in survival of adults with cancers of these sites across Europe. We calculated 5-year RS for patients diagnosed in 2000\u20132007. We estimated 5-year RS by the period approach to assess changes in survival between 1999\u20132001, 2002\u20132004 and 2005\u20132007, and provide reliable predictions for recently diagnosed patients.Five-year RS was 60% for adults diagnosed with soft-tissue cancer in 2000\u20132007 and 53% for those with bone cancer. RS declined with increasing age at diagnosis, especially for bone cancer. Survival from bone cancer varied widely between European regions, from 63 to 62% in Northern and Central Europe to 39% in Eastern Europe. Inter-regional variation was much less for soft-tissue cancer. For both site groupings, there was little evidence of change in five-year RS up to 2002\u20132004, followed by increases of 3\u20134% during 2005\u20132007.Outcomes for adults with bone and soft-tissue cancer in Europe began to improve around 2005; new therapeutic developments are expected to result in further progress.

Estimated cancer incidence was retrieved from GLOBOCAN and Brazilian National Cancer Institute. Five counterfactual scenarios for physical activity were considered: (i) theoretical minimum risk exposure level (\u22658,000 metabolic equivalent of tasks-minute/week \u2013 MET-min/week); (ii) physical activity recommendation (\u2265600 MET-min/week); (iii) a 10% reduction in prevalence of insufficient physical inactivity (<600 MET-min/week); (iv) physical activity level in each state equals the most active state in Brazil; (v) closing the gender differences in physical activity.About 19% (3,630 cases) of colon cancers and 12% (6,712 cases) of postmenopausal breast cancers could be prevented by increasing physical activity to \u22658,000 MET-min/week. Plausible counterfactual scenarios suggested the following impact on cancer prevention: reaching physical activity recommendation: 1.7% (1,113 cases) of breast and 6% (1,137 cases) of colon; 10% reduction in physical inactivity prevalence: 0.2% (111 cases) of breast and 0.6% (114 cases) of colon; most active state scenario: 0.3% (168 cases) of breast and 1% (189 cases) of colon; reducing gender differences in physical activity: 1.1% (384 cases) of breast and 0.6% (122 cases) of colon.High levels of physical activity are required to achieve a sizable impact on breast and colon cancer prevention in Brazil.",

There was, however, a tendency towards an increased risk of breast cancer with increasing levels of total coffee, caffeinated coffee and/or caffeine among premenopausal and normal weight women. Total coffee, caffeinated coffee, and caffeine were inversely associated with risk of endometrial cancer (HRper cup increase: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79-0.95, HRper cup increase: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.80-0.96 and HRper 100mg increase: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87-0.99, respectively).Our findings suggest that coffee and/or caffeine may be associated with reduced risk of endometrial cancer but, probably, associated increased with risk of breast cancer among premenopausal or normal weight women.

Risk factors for prostate cancer were uncommon, but more frequent in men age <55 years compared to men age 55\u201369\u2009years (17.6% vs. 13.5%, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Screened older men (age >70 years) were more likely to have a Charlson Comorbidity Index \u2265 3, compared to the 55\u201369 reference group (31.4% vs. 17.3%, p\u2009<\u20090.001).Low-value prostate cancer testing is prevalent. Between-testing intervals were often times shorter than recommended. Screening among younger men was frequent despite low rates of risk factors. High rates of comorbidity may limit life expectancy among older men receiving screening. These findings highlight the need for improved guidance with prostate cancer screening.",

But if women are able to have offspring after chemotherapy exposure, do these children also have decreased fecundity?This study is a retrospective cohort study utilizing the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a comprehensive resource that links birth, medical, death and cancer records for individuals in the state of Utah. The male and female children (F1 generation) of chemotherapy-exposed women (F0 generation) were identified. The number of live births (F2 generation) to this F1 generation was compared to two sets of chemotherapy-unexposed, matched controls using conditional Poisson regression models (regression coefficient, 95% confidence interval, P-value). The first unexposed was established using the general population and the second unexposed was established using first cousins to the F1 generation.The exposed F1 individuals had 77.2% fewer children (\u22121.48; \u22122.51 to \u22120.70; p\u202f=\u202f0.001) relative to the unexposed general population.

It focuses on the correct interpretation of commonly reported cancer survival measures facilitated through the use of dynamic interactive graphics. Statistics presented are based on parameter estimates obtained from flexible parametric relative survival models using large population-based English registry data containing information on survival across 6 cancer sites; Breast, Colon, Rectum, Stomach, Melanoma and Lung.Through interactivity, the tool improves understanding of various measures and how survival or mortality may vary by age and sex. Routine measures of cancer survival are reported, however, individualised estimates using crude probabilities are advocated, which is more appropriate for patients or health care professionals. The results are presented in various interactive formats facilitating understanding of individual risk and differences between various measures.\u201cInterPreT Cancer Survival\u201d is presented as an educational tool which engages the user through interactive features to improve the understanding of commonly reported cancer survival statistics. The tool has received positive feedback from a Cancer Research UK patient sounding board and there are further plans to incorporate more disease characteristics, e.g. stage.",

Standard P-value calculations use normal or logit-normal approximations, which may not be correct for small P-values and small sample sizes common in discovery research.We compared exact P-values, correct by definition, with logit-normal approximations in a simulated study of 40 cases and 160 controls. The key measure of biomarker performance was sensitivity at 90% specificity. Data for 3000 uninformative false markers and 30 informative true markers were generated randomly. We also analyzed real data for 2371 plasma protein markers measured in 121 breast cancer cases and 121 controls.In our simulation, using the same discovery criterion, exact P-values led to discovery of 24 true and 82 false biomarkers, while logit-normal approximate P-values yielded 20 true and 106 false biomarkers. The estimated true discovery rate was substantially off for approximate P-values: logit-normal estimated 42 but found 20. The exact method estimated 22, very close to 24, which was the actual number of true discoveries. Although these results are based on one specific simulation, qualitatively similar results were obtained from 10 random repetitions. With real data, ranking candidate biomarkers by exact P-values, versus approximate P-values, resulted in a very different ordering of these markers.Exact P-values, which correspond to permutation tests with non-parametric rank statistics such as empirical ROC statistics, are preferred over approximate P-values. Approximate P-values can lead to inappropriate biomarker selection rules and incorrect conclusions.Exact P-values in place of approximate P-values in discovery research may improve the yield of biomarkers that validate clinically.",

Early diagnosis can be defined by the disease stage at diagnosis or by other indicators derived from electronic health records. We evaluate the association between different early diagnosis indicators and survival, and discuss the implementation of the indicators in surveillance of early diagnosis.We searched the PubMed database and grey literature to identify early diagnosis indicators and evaluate their association with survival. We analysed cancer registrations for 355,502 cancer patients diagnosed in England during the period 2009\u20132013, and quantified the association between each early diagnosis indicator and 30-day mortality and five-year net survival.Each incremental difference in stage (I\u2013IV) predicts lower 5-year survival, so prognostic information is lost in comparisons which use binary stage indicators. Patients without a recorded stage have high risk of death shortly following diagnosis and lower 5-year survival. Emergency presentation is independently associated with lower five-year survival. Shorter intervals between first symptoms and diagnosis are not consistently associated with improved survival, potentially due to confounding from tumour characteristics.Contrary to current practice, we recommend that all the stage information should be used in surveillance. Patients missing stage should also be included to minimise bias. Combined data on stage and emergency presentation could be used to create summary prognostic measures. More work is needed to create statistics based on the diagnostic interval that will be useful for surveillance.",

     "abstract": "Randomized trials outside the U.S. have found non-inferior survival for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) versus primary debulking surgery (PDS) for advanced ovarian cancer (AOC). However, these trials reported lower overall survival and lower rates of optimal debulking than U.S. studies, leading to questions about generalizability to U.S. practice, where aggressive debulking is more common. Consequently, comparative effectiveness in the U.S. remains controversial. We reviewed U.S. comparative effectiveness studies of NACT versus PDS for AOC. Here we describe methodological challenges, compare results to trials outside the U.S., and make suggestions for future research. We identified U.S. studies published in 2010 or later that evaluated the comparative effectiveness of NACT versus PDS on survival in AOC through a PubMed search. Two independent reviewers abstracted data from eligible articles. Nine of 230 articles were eligible for review. Methodological challenges included unmeasured confounders, heterogeneous treatment effects, treatment variations over time, and inconsistent measurement of treatment and survival. Whereas some limitations were unavoidable, several limitations noted across studies were avoidable, including conditioning on mediating factors and immortal time introduced by measuring survival beginning from diagnosis. Without trials in the U.S., non-randomized studies are an important source of evidence for the ideal treatment for AOC. However, several methodological challenges exist when assessing the comparative effectiveness of NACT versus PDS in a non-randomized setting. Future observational studies must ensure that treatment is consistent throughout the study period and that treatment groups are comparable. Rapidly-evolving oncology data networks may allow for identification of treatment intent and other important confounders.",

We assess the tobacco control policies in the context of cohort-driven lung cancer incidence trends over a 25-year period, providing baseline predictions to 2035.Using data from the National Cancer Registry of Uruguay, an age-period-cohort analysis of trends 1990\u20132014 was performed. The NORDPRED package was used to predict the annual number of new cases of lung cancer and incidence rates up to 2035.In men, age-standardised (world) rates declined from a peak of 165.6 in 1995 to 103.1 by 2014, translating to a 70% reduction in the risk of lung cancer in men born in 1970 relative to the early-1940s. In females, rates increased steadily from 18.3 in 1991 to 30.0 by 2014, with successive increases in risk among generations of women born 1940\u20131960. There is however evidence of a decline in observed rates in women born recently. Extrapolations of the trends indicate an 8% reduction in the mean number of new lung cancer cases in men by 2035, but a 69% increase in women.Despite observed and predicted reductions in lung cancer incidence in Uruguayan men, rates among women are set to continue to increase, with a large rise in the annual number of female lung cancer diagnoses expected before 2035. There are signals of a diminishing risk among recent generations of women born after 1960. The current analysis provides important baseline information in assessing the future impact of the recent tobacco control initiatives in Uruguay.",

     "abstract": "Cancer survival has improved markedly in Australia for all ages but it is still lower in older patients. We hypothesize that the survival gap by age has increased. Our rationale is that treatment constraints in older people and potentially their limited participation in trials may have limited opportunities for survival gain.Post-diagnostic five-year cancer-specific mortality rates were analysed by age group for cancers recorded on the NSW Cancer Registry. Live cases were censored on December 31st, 2012. Hazards ratios (HRs) were obtained from proportional hazards regression for 1990-99 and 2000-12 diagnostic periods, using 1980-89 as the reference, adjusting for socio-demographic factors, degree of cancer spread, and for all cancers combined, for cancer sites.Five-year mortality reduced by diagnostic period for all cancers collectively from 53% in 1980-89 to 33% in 2000-12, with decreases for separate cancer sites. Adjusted HRs (95% confidence intervals) were 0.78 (0.77, 0.80) for 1990-99 and 0.61 (0.58, 0.63) for 2000-12 for all cancers combined. The downward trend in HRs was smaller for the 80+ year age group, leading to significantly higher HRs of 0.83 (0.81, 0.87) and 0.73 (0.70, 0.76) for 1990-99 and 2000-12 respectively. Results were similar using competing risk regression and 5-year rather than 10-year age strata.The reduction in cancer mortality was smaller in older people, as seen in the USA. Research is needed to achieve the best trade-offs between cancer control and harm avoidance in older people. Multidisciplinary teams have an important contribution to make.",

Use of the revised ESP for age-standardisation did not impact European regional incidence and mortality rankings.Poor survival for PC and BTC, together with increasing incidence, indicate that action is required. Countries with higher incidence had higher risk factor frequency, suggesting that prevention initiatives targeting risk factors should be promoted. Improvements in diagnosis and treatment are also required. Our results provide a baseline from which to monitor evolution of the PC/BTC burden in Europe.",

Cumulative incidence function (CIF) was used to estimate the cumulative incidence of cause-specific deaths in the presence of competing risks. The hazard ratios of SPC-specific deaths were assessed in two regression models: subdistribution hazard ratios from competing risk models (SHRs) and hazard ratios from Cox models (CHRs).Overall, 5339 (9.3%) of 57,288 patients developed SPCs and 2494 died from SPCs during the follow-up. While the cumulative incidence of first cancer deaths at 5, 10, 15 and 20-years gradually decreased over periods of first cancer diagnosis, the cumulative incidence of SPC deaths did not. The SHRs for SPC-specific deaths increased from the reference period 1980\u20131984 to a peak for first cancers diagnosed in 1995\u20131999 (SHR\u202f=\u202f1.18, 95%CI 1.03\u20131.35), before a decrease in 2005\u20132009 (SHR\u202f=\u202f0.82, 95%CI 0.70-0.95) in competing risk models.

To date, few studies have focused on testicular cancer among men aged \u2265 50 years. Thus, we sought to examine detailed descriptive features, including incidence rates and age patterns, of tumors that arise in the testes among men aged \u2265 50 years.Data from forty-one US cancer registries were included for the years 1999\u20132014. Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by race/ethnicity, histology, and age at diagnosis. Estimates of annual percent change (APC) were also calculated.Age-specific incidence rates of spermatocytic tumors, sex cord stromal tumors and lymphomas rose with age, while age-specific incidence rates of seminomas and nonseminomas declined. Between 1999 and 2014, the incidence of nonseminoma (APC\u202f=\u202f3.26, 95% CI: 2.27\u20134.25) increased more than any other tumor type.

We found a significant age effect in the APC model for the incidence of thyroid cancer but no significant cohort or period effects.The incidence of thyroid cancer is rising. This is primarily attributable to an increase in papillary carcinomas. The relative survival has improved significantly in Denmark since 1980. The cause of the increasing incidence remains to be established, but enhanced diagnostic scrutiny and increased iodine intake may be influential.",

     "abstract": "Anxiety and depression are the most prevalent mental health pathologies among women with breast cancer. Social, clinical and contextual variables may influence emotional stress among women with breast cancer.The aim of this work is to study anxiety and depression in a cohort of women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2003 and 2013 in Barcelona. We evaluate social and clinical determinants.We performed a mixed cohort study (prospective and retrospective) using a convenience sample of women diagnosed with breast cancer. The information sources were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression questionnaire and hospital medical records. Dependent variables were anxiety and depression; independent variables were social class, age, employment status, tumour stage at diagnosis, time since diagnosis, social network and social support. We performed a descriptive analysis, a bivariate analysis, and a multivariate logistic regression analysis.A total of 1086 (48.6%) women had some degree of anxiety-related problem. As for depression. In the case of depression, 225 (15%) women had some degree of depression-related problem. Low emotional support and social isolation were clear risk factors for having more anxiety and depression. Low social class was also a risk factor, and age also played a role.Our results show that women long period of cancer survival have high prevalences of anxiety than depression, and this prevalence of anxiety is higher than the general population. In addition, we found inequalities between social classes and the isolation and social support are worse too in low social class.",

     "abstract": "Although the incidence of multiple myeloma (MM) in Asia is lower than in Western countries, it is steadily increasing. However, limited data are available that describe the epidemiology of MM in Asia.We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Taiwan National Healthcare Insurance Research database to estimate the disease burden and clinical characteristics of patients with MM in Taiwan. All newly diagnosed confirmed MM patients during 2007\u20132012 were enrolled. Patients were followed up until death or end of the observation period (December 31, 2013), whichever occurred first.A total of 2723 newly diagnosed MM patients were included in the cohort analysis, of whom 58.0% (1578/2723) were men. The average age of MM patients was 67.6 years. At the time of diagnosis, the mean Charlson Comorbidity Index was 1.8, 35.3% of patients had anemia, 18.0% had bone fracture, 16.4% had renal disease and 17.3% had pneumonia. The crude annual incidence of newly diagnosed MM increased from 1.74 per 100 000 population in 2007 to 2.27 per 100 000 population in 2012 (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), and the age-adjusted incidence from 1.41 to 1.59 per 100 000 population (p\u202f=\u202f0.01). The use of novel treatments expanded over the study period. The crude and age-adjusted annual MM mortality rate did not change significantly over time. Case fatality decreased from 25.5% in 2007 to 19.4% in 2012 (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001).The age-adjusted incidence of MM in Taiwan increased by 13% between 2007 and 2012. Despite the introduction of new treatments, MM remains largely incurable with 19.4% mortality.",

Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs, with 95% Confidence Intervals) were calculated for each of the 8047 Italian municipalities, for both diseases, with respect to Regional figures. A geographical clustering analysis at municipal level was performed, applying SatScan methods.In Italy, 16,086 persons (about 1,340/year) died for MM, in analysed period.National Standardized rates of MM mortality are 3.65/100,000 in men and 1.09/100,000 in women, with an increasing annual trend, among male population. The highest rates were found in men from Northern Regions. Significant clusters (p\u202f<\u202f0.10) were found corresponding to areas that hosted major asbestos-cement plants, naval shipyards, petrochemical plants and refineries. Furthermore, excesses were found corresponding to chemical and textile industries; the latter involving, particularly, female population. Excesses were found also in areas near the chrysotile mine of Balangero, and in Biancavilla, a town with a stone quarry contaminated by fluoro-edenitic fibres; an excess of MM mortality was observed among male population living in a minor island where a Navy shipyard is located.Mortality for mesothelioma in Italy is still increasing, twenty-six years after the asbestos ban. Epidemiological surveillance of mesothelioma mortality allows to detect the temporal trend of the disease and highlights previously unknown or underestimated sources of asbestos exposure.",

The aim of our study was to identify determinants of treatment administration in this population of cancer patients aged over 65 years taking into account competing risks of death.The INCAPAC study is a population-based study. Four cancer registries and three prospective cohort studies on older subjects (age \u226565 years) from Gironde, a French department, were merged to identify older cancer patients. We used a non-parametric multi-state model including three states (cancer, treatment and all-cause death). This model allowed studying determinants of treatment administration (all treatments including curative, symptomatic and palliative treatments) and mortality considering that patients can move from cancer state to death state, either directly or through the treatment phase. Studied variables were demographic and socioeconomic-, cancer-, health-, and geriatric-related.A total of 450 patients were included in the analyses. They were mainly aged 85 and over, men and educated. Among included patients, 372 (83%) received cancer treatment. In the final multivariate model, dementia was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving cancer treatment (HR\u202f=\u202f0.68, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.47\u20130.99). In treated patients, age, sex, comorbidities, dependency and stage at diagnosis were associated to all-cause mortality, and in untreated patients, diagnosis of dementia and stage at diagnosis were associated to mortality.Further studies are necessary to understand the impact of geriatric impairments on treatment administration and to develop clinical practice guidelines.",

We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and then pooled HRs using a random-effects model.Over 24\u201326 years of follow-up, we documented 1328 melanoma cases (648 men and 680 women). Higher intake of folate from food only, but not total folate, was associated with increased melanoma risk (pooled HR for top versus bottom quintile: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.13\u20131.64; P for trend\u202f=\u202f0.001). The association was significant in men, but attenuated in women. Higher intake of vitamins B6 and B12, choline, betaine, and methionine were not associated with melanoma risk, although there was modest increasing trend of risk for vitamin B6 from food only (pooled HR for top versus bottom quintile: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.99\u20131.41; P for trend\u202f=\u202f0.03).We found some evidence that higher intake of folate from food only was associated with a modest increased risk of cutaneous melanoma. However, since other factors related to dietary folate intake may account for the observed association, our findings warrant further investigation.",

     "abstract": "High red and processed meat intakes are associated with increased colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. The effect of eliminating or reducing red and processed meat consumption on CRC burden was not previously quantified in Denmark. The aim of this study was to calculate the possible effects of reductions in red and processed meat consumption on future CRC incidence in the Danish adult population.Under six scenarios of prevalence exposure (meat consumption) the number of CRC cases in Denmark for a 30-year period (2016-2045) was estimated and compared to the projected number of CRCs if the prevalence of meat consumption remains constant. Data was obtained from the NORDCAN register, Statistics Denmark, and from the Danish dietary survey data (DANSDA). Analyses were conducted using the Prevent model.During the 30-year period, a total of 36,767 (19.8%) CRC cases out of 185,937 expected could be avoided in Denmark by eliminating the consumption of both red and processed meat. For the same period, a modest reduction in both red and processed meat consumption could lead to the prevention of 16,964 (9.1%) CRC cases. The greatest reductions were seen among men, and the highest impact was estimated for the elimination or reduction of processed meat consumption.Decreased red and processed meat consumption could reduce the burden of CRC markedly in Denmark. These results can assist public health planners and help highlight the important role of a modest but realistic reduction in meat consumption in the prevention of CRC.",

The results were compared to the scientific impact of a series of treatment trials conducted over the same 20-year time period (1991\u20132010, inclusive). Average annual citation counts were compared using t-tests. Scientific impact was also assessed relative to trial costs.Twenty-seven treatment trials with 17,208 patients and four chemoprevention trials with 87,550 patients were examined. The mean annual citation rate for primary articles was higher for chemoprevention trials compared to treatment trials (188.1 vs. 40.4, p\u202f=\u202f.001). For both primary and secondary article publications, mean annual citations for articles associated with chemoprevention trials were also higher (483.9 vs. 69.0, p\u202f=\u202f.0003). Large chemoprevention trials were estimated to provide 50% more total citations from primary and secondary articles on a cost-adjusted basis.Based on these criteria, the scientific impact of large phase III cancer chemoprevention trials was very high in absolute terms, and as good as or better than that of treatment trials after accounting for expenditure. For appropriate scientific questions, large chemoprevention trials provide a good scientific return on investment for federal funding agencies.",

Six key data fields were matched using National Health Index numbers in order to identify and resolve registration discrepancies. Capture-recapture methods were used to assess the completeness of cancer registration. RESULTS: 794 unique cases were reported; 718 from the NZCR, 721 from the NZCCR and 643 from both registries. 27 invalid cancer registrations were identified, including 19 residents of the Pacific Islands who had travelled to New Zealand for treatment. The NZCCR provided 55 non-malignant central nervous system tumour and 16 Langerhans cell histiocytosis cases which were not registered by the NZCR. The NZCR alerted the NZCCR to 18 cases missed due to human error and 23 cases that had not been referred to the specialist paediatric oncology centres. 762 cases were verified as true incident cases, an incidence rate of 166.8 per million. Registration accuracy for six key data fields was 98.6%. According to their respective inclusion criteria case completeness was 99.3% for the NZCR and 94.4% for the NZCCR. For childhood malignancies covered by both registries, capture-recapture methods estimated case ascertainment at greater than 99.9%. CONCLUSION: With two national registries covering childhood cancers, New Zealand is uniquely positioned to undertake regular cooperative activities to ensure high quality data is available for research and patient care.",

Currently, PSA is a biomarker for the diagnosis and screening of prostate cancer and it was the first cancer biomarker approved by the FDA. The quantity and serum isoforms of male PSA, allows distinguishing between carcinoma and benign inflammatory disease of the prostate. Initially, it was thought that PSA was produced only by the prostate, and thus, a protein that was expressed exclusively in men. However, several authors report that PSA is a protein that is expressed by multiple non-prostatic tissues not only in men but also in women. Some authors also report that in women, the expression of this protein is highly related to breast and colon cancer and therefore can act as a possible biomarker for early detection, diagnosis and prognosis of these cancers in women. In this review, we will focus on the characteristics of the PSA at a molecular level, its current clinical implications, the expression of this protein in non-prostatic tissues, and its relationship with cancer, especially in women.",

Analyses were restricted to ages 30\u201384 years and stratified by region. We used the age-period-cohort (APC) framework to complement standard descriptive techniques and to forecast future trends. Estimable APC parameters included net drift, longitudinal age-specific incidence rate curves, and fitted age-specific incidence rate ratios.There were 71 545 breast cancer cases diagnosed in Portugal at ages 30\u201384 years from 1998 to 2011. The South presented the highest age-standardized rate (155.8/100 000), while the North presented the fastest rate of increase (3.6%/year). Age-specific statistical interactions were observed between regions. Younger women in the North revealed a decreased risk of developing breast cancer compared to women from the same age group in the South and Centre, while that risk was reversed in older women (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). We estimate that from 2014 onwards, the North might rank first among all regions.The variant patterns observed could be due to a combination of different screening practices and/or exposure to risk factors across regions. Disease heterogeneity among younger and older women may also explain part of the differences in age-specific rates. These results justify continued monitoring of breast cancer incidence by region.",

A statistically significant temporal increase in incidence was noted only in Belarus. Most cases (\u223c75%) were diagnosed before the fifth year of life, with rates steadily declining thereafter; median age at diagnosis was similar in SEE countries and SEER. A slight male preponderance in the first year of life (male:female\u202f=\u202f1.1) was followed by a female preponderance in the older age groups (male:female\u202f=\u202f0.7). Lastly, a statistically significant positive association between higher HDI and increasing nephroblastoma incidence was noted (regression coefficient: +3.25, 95%CI: +1.35, +5.15).Variations in incidence and time trends across the examined registries, changing male-to-female patterns with advancement in age, and positive associations with the HDI imply a plausible role for environmental and genetic factors in disease etiology, and these need to be explored further.",

We conducted descriptive and bivariate analysis using the Chi-Square test and adjusted for relevant variables using logistic regression. The dependent variables were the functional scales of QoL and the independent variables were sociodemographic and clinical variables.We observed significant differences for most QoL functions. Women from the most disadvantaged class, those in social isolation, or those who had suffered relapses showed the poorest results for most of the function scales. In contrast, age had differential effects depending on the function studied.The QoL of women diagnosed with breast cancer is closely linked to both their social and economic status, and to their stage of disease progression. It is necessary to explore interventions that focus on the social determinants of health in order to mitigate their effects on breast cancer survivors\u2019 QoL.",

     "abstract": "Body mass index (BMI) has been constantly increasing over the last decades in most parts of the world, most notably in transitioning nations such as Brazil. High BMI (>22\u202fkg/m2) is associated with an increased risk of 14 types of cancer. We estimated the extent to which reducing high BMI could lower cancer incidence in Brazil, nationally as well as at regional and state levels.We calculated fractions of cancer incidence in 2012 attributable to high BMI as well as projections for attributable cases in 2025 using BMI data from representative national surveys and relative risks published in meta-analyses. Estimates of cancer incidence were retrieved from GLOBOCAN and the Brazilian National Cancer Institute.We found that 15,465 (3.8%) of all new cancer cases diagnosed in Brazil in 2012 were attributable to high BMI, with a higher burden in women (5.2%) than in men (2.6%). The cancer sites contributing most to the number of attributable cases were breast (n\u202f=\u202f4777), corpus uteri (n\u202f=\u202f1729), and colon (n\u202f=\u202f681) in women, and colon (n\u202f=\u202f1062), prostate (n\u202f=\u202f926), and liver (n\u202f=\u202f651) in men. The highest population attributable fractions (PAFs) for all cancers were found in the richer states of the country, located in the south (1.5% men/3.4% women) and the southeast (1.5% men/3.3% women).Cancer cases attributable to high BMI will reach 29,490, which will be 4.6% of all cancers in Brazil in 2025; the extent will be greater in women (6.2% or 18,837) than in men (3.2% or 10,653).

We considered European incidence rates (IRs), calculated over all the data available in RARECAREnet, as a valid a priori to merge with country-specific observed data. Therefore we provided (1) Bayesian estimates of IRs and the yearly numbers of cases of rare cancers in each country; (2) the expected time (T) in years needed to observe one new case; and (3) practical criteria to decide when to use the Bayesian approach.Bayesian and classical estimates did not differ much; substantial differences (>10%) ranged from 77 rare cancers in Iceland to 14 in England. The smaller the population the larger the number of rare cancers needing a Bayesian approach. Bayesian estimates were useful for cancers with fewer than 150 observed cases in a country during the study period; this occurred mostly when the population of the country is small.For the first time the Bayesian estimates of IRs and the yearly expected numbers of cases for each rare cancer in each individual European country were calculated. Moreover, the indicator T is useful to convey incidence estimates for exceptionally rare cancers and in small countries; it far exceeds the professional lifespan of a medical doctor.",

We used annual adult cancer deaths from GLOBOCAN2012 to estimate the years of productive life lost between cancer death and pensionable age in each country, valued using national and international data for wages, and workforce statistics. Sensitivity analyses examined various methodological assumptions.The total cost of lost productivity due to premature cancer mortality in the BRICS countries in 2012 was $46\u00b73 billion, representing 0\u00b733% of their combined gross domestic product.

For both tumours increasing mortality was associated with less urban and more remote rural areas.This study found that for osteosarcoma, early mortality was associated with residence at diagnosis in areas of higher unemployment, suggesting risk of early death may be socio-economically determined. For both tumours, distance from urban centres may lead to greater risk of early death.",

     "abstract": "The impact of rectal cancer tumor height on local recurrence and metastatic spread is unknown. The objective was to evaluate the impact of rectal cancer tumor height from the anal verge on metastatic spread and local recurrence patterns.The Norwegian nationwide surgical quality registry was reviewed for curative rectal cancer resections from 1/1/1996-12/15/2006. Cancers were stratified into five height groups: 0\u20133\u202fcm, >3\u20135\u202fcm, >5\u20139\u202fcm, >9\u201312\u202fcm, 12\u202fcm\u2013HI. Competing risk and proportional hazards models assessed the relationship between tumor height and patterns of metastasis and survival.6859 patients were analyzed. After median follow-up of 52 months (IQR 20\u201396), 26.7% (n\u202f=\u202f1835) experienced recurrence. With tumors >12\u202fcm, the risk of liver metastases increased (crude HR 1.49, p\u202f=\u202f0.03), while lung metastases decreased (crude HR 0.66, p\u202f=\u202f0.03), and risk of death decreased (crude HR 0.81, p\u202f=\u202f0.001) The cumulative incidence of pelvic recurrence were highest for the low tumors (p\u202f=\u202f0.01). Median time to liver metastases was 14months (IQR 7\u201324), lung metastases 25months (IQR 13\u201339), pelvic recurrence 19months (IQR10-32), (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). Time to metastases in liver and lungs were significantly associated with tumor height (p\u202f<\u202f0.001)There are distinct differences in metastatic recurrence patterns and time to recurrence from different anatomic areas of the rectum. In crude analyses, tumor height impacted metastatic spread to the liver and lungs. However, when adjusting for treatment variables, the hazard of metastatic spread to the liver and lungs are limited. Nevertheless, time to metastases in liver and lungs is significantly impacted by tumor height. Venous drainage of the rectal cancer may be a significant contributor of rectal cancer metastatic spread, but further research is warranted.",

Since health care systems and patient management differ between countries, population-based data from cancer registries with high coverage may provide further insight into real-life achievements and unmet needs. We report on the first population-based nation-wide study of incidence, mortality and survival of multiple myeloma in Switzerland covering the era of autologous stem cell transplantation and the first proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs.We performed a retrospective registry study with data from the National Institute for Cancer Epidemiology and Registration (NICER) database in Switzerland from 1994 to 2013.We identified 5770 patients with multiple myeloma. Incidence has increased from 419 new cases per year in 1994\u20131998 to 557 new cases per year in 2009\u20132013 while the age-adjusted incidence rate remained stable at 4.7\u20135.0 per 100\u2032000 person-years.

Among the several determinants of this late diagnosis, the most important is the healthcare-seeking behaviour of the oral cancer patients. The aim of this study was to explore the care-seeking behaviour and its determinants among oral cancer patients.A face-to-face in-depth interview was conducted among 70 oral cancer patients using a semi-structured questionnaire, and qualitative content analysis of the results was performed.All the patients had squamous-cell carcinoma and none had attended any screening programme. The most common site affected was the buccal mucosa with a non-healing wound. Most of the patients contacted a doctor available nearby; only 7% of patients consulted a dentist. Only one patient approached a traditional healer. The median patient delay was 30 (4\u2013365) days and the professional delay was 40 (4\u2013650) days. Enablers included determinants such as increasing symptoms (80%), influence of the society (74%), fear (10%), and social media (3%). The main barriers were lack of awareness (97%), hope that the lesion will heal spontaneously (90%), lack of perception of seriousness (64%), financial constraints (55%), provider switching (47%), and missed diagnosis (44%).The care-seeking path among oral cancer patients is complex, customised, and influenced by multiple patient-related and system-related factors.",

Reliable population-based cancer statistics, however, continues to be a scarce resource in Africa and tends to be urban biased with limited rural coverage. In addition, many haematological malignancies are regarded as rare cancers, a sub-group that often affects the young disproportionately and require advanced diagnostic services and facilities able to deliver costly sophisticated treatments. This study provides a first attempt to estimate the incidence of haematological malignancies among the Eastern Cape Province population of South Africa.Multiple public- and private sector data archives and resources were utilised to optimise the identification of incident cases, including clinical records; bone marrow; cytology; histology; flow cytometry and cytogenetic records. Crude incidence, age-and gender-standardised rates are presented and comparison made with existing national data and select data from other economically developed countries and global institutions.A total of 3603 incident cases were identified between 2004 and 2013. Mature lymphoid malignancies accounted for approximately 60% (n\u202f=\u202f2153), myeloma/plasma cell neoplasms 13% (n\u202f=\u202f465), acute leukaemia 17% (n\u202f=\u202f596), chronic myeloid leukaemia 4% (n\u202f=\u202f155) and other myeloproliferative neoplasms 6% (n\u202f=\u202f234) when stratified according to conventional groups. Most subtypes increase with age, with male excess.Haematological malignancies in the Eastern Cape Province show disparities in gender and pathology-specific incidence patterns. The present study suggest that haematological malignancies are not uncommon in this region and the incidence rate of at least one rare subtype, APL, is comparable with some European populations.",

Higher intake of processed meat (OR 2.56, CI 1.09\u20136.03) and processed fish (OR 2.24, CI 1.02\u20134.95) were found associated with increased risk of HCC; and decreased risk of HCC with fresh fish, fruits, and milk.Strong relationship between different dietary factors, alcohol beverage with HCC suggests that control on dietary and drinking habit will be an important strategy to combat HCC in this region. Risk factors identified in this study will help to plan more effectively targeted risk reduction strategies and programs in this region.",

     "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the most prevalent malignancy in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) with many women only seeking professional help when they are experiencing symptoms, implying late-stage malignancy and higher mortality rates. This ecological study assesses population-level exposures of SSA women to the numerous risk factors for HPV infection and cervical cancer, against late-stage presentation of cervical cancer.A literature review revealed the relevant risk factors in SSA. Open-access databases were mined for variables closely representing each risk factor. A proxy for late-stage presentation was used (ratio of incidence-to-mortality, IMR), and gathered from IARC\u2019s GLOBOCAN 2012 database. Variables showing significant correlation to the IMR were used in stepwise multiple regression to quantify their effect on the IMR.Countries with high cervical cancer mortality rates relative to their incidence have an IMR nearer one, suggesting a larger proportion of late-stage presentation. Western Africa had the lowest median IMR (1.463), followed by Eastern Africa (IMR\u202f=\u202f1.595) and Central Africa (IMR\u202f=\u202f1.675), whereas Southern Africa had the highest median IMR (1.761). Variables selected for the final model explain 65.2% of changes seen in the IMR. Significant predictors of IMR were GDP (coefficient\u202f=\u202f2.189\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22126, p\u202f=\u202f0.064), HIV infection (\u22121.936\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22123, p\u202f=\u202f0.095), not using a condom (\u22121.347\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22123, p\u202f=\u202f0.013), high parity (\u22121.744\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122, p\u202f=\u202f0.008), and no formal education (\u22121.311\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22123, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).Using an IMR enables identification of factors predicting late-stage cervical cancer in SSA including: GDP, HIV infection, not using a condom, high parity and no formal education.",

Our aim was to assess the risk of oesophageal cancer assessing confounding by indication.This population-based cohort study included all 796,492 adults exposed to maintenance therapy with PPIs in Sweden in 2005\u20132012. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma (and squamous cell carcinoma as a comparison) among long-term PPI users relative to the corresponding background population. The different indications for maintenance PPI therapy were analysed separately.Among all individuals using maintenance PPI therapy, the overall SIR of oesophageal adenocarcinoma was 3.93 (95% CI 3.63\u20134.24). The SIRs of adenocarcinoma were increased also among individuals without gastro-oesophageal reflux disease who used PPIs for indications not associated with any increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. For example, the SIRs among participants using maintenance PPI therapy because of maintenance treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin were 2.74 (95% CI 1.96\u20133.71) and 2.06 (95% CI 1.60\u20132.60), respectively. The SIRs of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma were increased for most investigated indications, but to a lesser degree than for oesophageal adenocarcinoma.In conclusion, the long term use of PPIs is associated with increased risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in the absence of other risk factors. Long term use of PPIs should be addressed with caution.",

The objective of this study was to examine the associations between physical activity and sitting time and polyps at the time of screening.We conducted a cross-sectional study of 2496 individuals undergoing screening-related colonoscopy in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Physical activity and sitting time were characterized using hours of rMVPA, meeting physical activity recommendations and hours of sitting time using self-reported data obtained from the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) for presence of polyps associated with rMVPA and sitting time.Meeting physical activity guidelines of \u2265150\u202fmin/week was non-significantly associated with a modest decrease in odds of having \u22651 polyp at screening (ORadj\u202f=\u202f0.95, 95% CI: 0.80\u20131.14).

In stratified analysis, larger inverse associations were observed between physical activity and the presence of polyps in females, obese individuals, and ever smokers, compared to pooled findings.In this large CRC screening population, there was a suggestive association between increased rMVPA and reduced prevalence of polyps at screening, particularly among females. Even low amounts of regular sitting time (0\u201320\u202fh/day) were associated with the presence of polyps, particularly among males. Further research on rMVPA and sitting time is necessary to better inform strategies to reduce the frequency of pre-malignant colorectal lesions.",

We then proceeded to a risk stratification and validation of the index on the derivation cohort.Two hundred and sixty-two NSCLC patients were included. Two models were constructed, using the following nine variables as prognostic factors: age, performance status, haemoglobin level, leucocyte count, calcium, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase levels, histological type and TNM stage. Four prognostic indices were derived, and the best one was picked and validated on a population of five risk groups. The higher the risk group, the shorter the survival.This novel and simple prognostic tool could predict survival more accurately in patients with NSCLC.",

Information on gastric cancer-specific deaths was retrieved from mortality records collected by regional governments. Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific mortality (CSS).In our population of 371 patients, a reduction in all-cause mortality was observed in metformin users (adjusted HR\u202f=\u202f0.73, 95% CI: [0.52; 1.01], p\u202f=\u202f0.06) but not for cancer specific mortality (adjusted HR\u202f=\u202f0.86, 95% CI: [0.56; 1.33], p\u202f=\u202f0.50).

Moreover, no dose-response relationship between metformin use and either all-cause or cancer-specific mortality was observed.In the first population based study of metformin use in gastric cancer adenocarcinoma patients with previous diabetes, our findings suggest that metformin use might improve overall mortality.

We applied flexible parametric cure models to data of four cancer sites provided by the French network of cancer registries (FRANCIM). Then estimates of the time-to-cure by TTC and by two existing methods were derived and compared. Cure fractions and probabilities P(t) were also computed.Depending on the age group, TTC ranged from to 8 to 10 years for colorectal and pancreatic cancer and was nearly 12 years for breast cancer. In thyroid cancer patients under 55 years at diagnosis, TTC was strikingly 0: the probability of being cured was >0.95 just after diagnosis. This is an interesting result regarding the health insurance premiums of these patients. The estimated values of time-to-cure from the three approaches were close for colorectal cancer only.We propose a new approach, based on estimated covariate-specific probability of being cured, to estimate time-to-cure. Compared to two existing methods, the new approach seems to be more intuitive and natural and less sensitive to the survival time distribution.",

Semi-quantitative methods suggested the NCRU\u2019s data was reasonably complete, although decreases in age-specific incidence and mortality rates in the elderly indicated some missing cases at older ages. The proportion of microscopically-verified cases increased from 73.6% in 2002 to 82.3% in 2012, with death-certificate-only (DCO) proportions stable at around 0.1% and unknown stage recorded in 9.6% of male and 7.5% of female solid tumours. Timeliness was considered acceptable, with reporting >99% complete within a turn-around time of 15 months.While timely reporting of national data reflects the advantages of a mandatory data collection system, a low DCO% and observed age-specific declines suggest possible underreporting of incidence and mortality data, particularly at older ages. Overall, the evaluation indicates that the data are reasonably comparable and thus may be used to describe the magnitude of the cancer burden in Ukraine. Given its central role in monitoring and evaluation of cancer control activities, ensuring the sustainability of NCRU operations throughout the process of healthcare system reform is of utmost importance.",

Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs), and year, age, race, sex-adjusted standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for 1996\u20131999, 2000\u20132005, and 2006\u20132013, corresponding to advances in ART.The study included 5822 deceased PWA of whom 90% were male and 68% were aged 35\u201354 at time of death. Over time, the PMRs significantly decreased for ADCs (2.6%, 1.4%, 1.2%) and increased for NADCs (4.3%, 7.0%, 12.3%). For all years combined (1996\u20132013) and compared to the California population, significantly elevated SMRs were observed for these cancers: all NADCs combined (2.1), anal (58.4), Hodgkin lymphoma (10.5), liver (5.2), lung/larynx (3.0), rectal (5.2), and tongue (4.7). Over time, the SMRs for liver cancer (SMR 19.8, 11.2, 5.0) significantly decreased while the SMRs remained significantly elevated over population levels for anal (SMR 123, 48.2, 45.5), liver (SMR 19.8, 11.2, 5.0), and lung/larynx cancer (SMR 5.3, 4.7, 3.6).A decline in ADC PMRs and increase in NADC PMRs represent a shift in the cancer burden, likely due to ART use.

The fraction of non-classifiable AML cases decreased over time (54.6% to 41.8%) but remained high in elderly patients (65\u201374\u00a0yrs: 44%; 75\u201384\u00a0yrs: 54.2%, 85\u00a0+\u00a0yrs: 59.1%), suggesting less accurate diagnostics and reporting with increasing age. 5\u00a0yrs relative survival (RS) correlated with AML risk class (favorable: 61.7%-68.4%; adverse risk: 11.4%-21.9%) and age (<65\u00a0yrs: 42.6\u201343.3%; 75\u201384\u00a0yrs: 2.0-3.0%), but improved only modestly overall (19.2% to 23.3%). Interestingly, we identified a significant improvement of RS in patients aged 65\u201374\u00a0yrs (5\u00a0yrs: 5.2% to 13.5%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). As surrogate for changes in management, we found an increase of allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantations (1.4 to 7%) and clinical trial activities (25 to 29%) for elderly AML patients during the observation period. Our analysis indicates that recent progress made in management of elderly AML patients results in an improvement of survival on a population-based level in Switzerland and that therapeutic nihilism is not justifiable.",

Further investigation could help understand these patterns.This retrospective cohort study investigated pediatric cancer (0\u201319 years old) age adjusted incidence rates (AAR) in Nebraska using the Nebraska Cancer Registry. SEER AARs were also calculated as a proxy for pediatric cancer incidence in the United States (1990\u20132013) and compared to the Nebraska data. Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping was also used to display the spatial distribution of cancer in Nebraska at the county level. Finally, location\u2013allocation analysis (LAA) was performed to identify a site for the placement of a medical center to best accommodate rural pediatric cancer cases.The AAR of pediatric cancers was 173.3 per 1,000,000 in Nebraska compared to 167.1 per 1,000,000 in SEER. The AAR for lymphoma was significantly higher in Nebraska (28.1 vs. 24.6 per 1,000,000; p\u202f=\u202f0.009). For the 15\u201319 age group, the AAR for the 3 most common pediatric cancers were higher in Nebraska (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Twenty-three counties located >2\u202fh driving distance to care facilities showed at least a 10% higher incidence than the overall state AAR. GIS mapping identified a second potential treatment site that would alleviate this geographic burden.Regional differences within Nebraska present a challenge for rural populations. Novel use of GIS mapping to highlight regional differences and identify solutions for access to care issues could be used by similar states.",

The study aimed to examine long-term incidence and survival trends of CRC in Estonia with specific focus on subsite and stage.We analysed CRC incidence and relative survival using Estonian Cancer Registry data on all cases of colorectal cancer (ICD-10 C18\u201321) diagnosed in 1995\u20132014. TNM classification was used to categorise stage.Age-standardized incidence of colon cancer increased both in men and women at a rate of approximately 1% per year. Significant increase was seen for right-sided tumours, but not for left-sided tumours. Rectal cancer incidence increased significantly only in men and anal cancer incidence only in women. Age-standardized five-year relative survival for colon cancer increased from 50% in 1995\u20131999 to 59% in 2010\u20132014; for rectal cancer, from 38% to 56%. Colon cancer survival improved significantly for left-sided tumours (from 51% to 62%) and stage IV disease (from 6% to 15%). For rectal cancer, significant survival gain was seen for stage II (from 58% to 75%), stage III (from 34% to 70%) and stage IV (from 1% to 12%).In the pre-screening era in Estonia, increase in colon cancer incidence was limited to right-sided tumours. Large stage-specific survival gain, particularly for rectal cancer, was probably due to better staging and advances in multimodality treatment. Nonetheless, more than one quarter of new CRC cases are diagnosed at stage IV, emphasising the need for an efficient screening program.",

A clear plan was developed for use of the GPCR data. New primary cancers were registered based on international standards, indices of data quality were routinely assessed and age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) per 100,000 person-years calculated using IARC\u2019s CanReg-5 software.Overall, 19807 new cancer cases were registered during the study period, an average of 1981 cases per annum, with overall ASR of 175.0 and 142.4 in males and females, respectively. The GPCR data suggested gastrointestinal and breast cancers as the most common malignancies in Golestan province. We observed increasing incidence rates of breast and colorectal cancers but declining trends of esophageal cancer. Overall, indices of data quality were within acceptable ranges.The GPCR data have been included in IARC\u2019s Cancer Incidence in Five Continents series, were used in 21 research projects, and published as 30 research papers. The key ingredients for the successful establishment and maintenance of the GPCR included sustainable sources of funding, a clear action plan for the use of data as well as stakeholder cooperation across all areas of the registration. The GPCR may be considered as a model for planning population-based cancer registries in lesser-resourced settings.",

     "abstract": "Overweight, as defined by high body mass index (BMI), is an established risk factor for various morbidities including cancer. Globally, its prevalence has increased markedly over the past decades. The aim of this study was to estimate the proportion and number of cancers that were attributable to high BMI in France in 2015.Population attributable fractions (PAFs) and numbers of cancer cases attributable to high BMI (a population mean BMI above the optimum of 22\u00a0kg/m2) were estimated by age and sex, for cancer sites with convincing or probable evidence of an established causal link. Assuming a 10-year lag-period, PAFs were calculated using mean BMI estimates from a cross-sectional French population survey, and relative risk estimates from published meta-analyses.An estimated 18,639 cancer cases diagnosed in France in 2015 were attributable to high BMI, corresponding to 5.3% of all cancer cases (6.7% in women and 4.1% in men). This included 4507 cases of postmenopausal breast and 3380 cases of colon cancer. The highest estimated PAFs were for oesophageal adenocarcinoma and corpus uteri cancer (37% and 34%, respectively).High BMI is associated with a substantial number of cancer cases in France, a country with a low but increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity when compared to other European countries. Assuming that the association between high BMI and cancer is causal, these results highlight the need to prioritise the prevention of this risk factor as part of cancer control planning in France and elsewhere in Europe.",

Besides occupational exposure to chemicals, other substances such as tobacco and nitrite in groundwater have been identified as risk factors for UC. We investigated if regional differences in UC incidence rates are associated with agricultural, industrial and residential land use.Newly diagnosed cases of UC between 2003 and 2010 were included. Information within 364 administrative districts of Germany from 2004 for land use factors were obtained and calculated as a proportion of the total area of the respective administrative district and as a smoothed proportion. Furthermore, information on smoking habits was included in our analysis. Kulldorff spatial clustering was used to detect different clusters. A negative binomial model was used to test the spatial association between UC incidence as a ratio of observed versus expected incidence rates, land use and smoking habits.We identified 437,847,834 person years with 171,086 cases of UC. Cluster analysis revealed areas with higher incidence of UC than others (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002). Multivariate analysis including significant pairwise interactions showed that the environmental factors were independently associated with UC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The RR was 1.066 (95% CI 1.052\u20131.080), 1.066 (95% CI 1.042\u20131.089) and 1.067 (95% CI 1.045\u20131.093) for agricultural, industrial and residential areas, respectively, and 0.996 (95% CI 0.869\u20130.999) for the proportion of never smokers.This study displays regional differences in incidence of UC in Germany.

However, this association was not stronger in the more contaminated areas than in the others. Conversely, the reported consumption of fresh dairy products was not statistically associated with DTC risk.Because the increase in DTC risk associated with a higher consumption of locally produced vegetables was not more important in the most contaminated areas, our study lacked power to provide evidence for a strong association between consumption of potentially contaminated food and DTC risk.",

Studies have shown an inverse relationship to primary care physician (PCP) density and insurance coverage with stage of cancer diagnosis.Data was obtained from OK2Share, an Oklahoma Central Cancer Registry, for bladder, kidney, and prostate cancer from 2000 to 2010. Physician data was obtained through the State Licensing Board. The 2010 national census was used for population data. High PCP density was defined as greater than or equal to the median value: 3.17 PCP/10,000 persons. Chi-square and multivariate logistic regressions were used to analyze effects of PCP density, insurance status, and urologist presence on advanced stage diagnosis.27,086 patients were identified across 77 counties. As PCP density increased by 1 PCP/10,000 persons, the odds ratios (OR) of an advanced stage at diagnosis were 0.383, 0.468, 0.543 for bladder, kidney, and prostate cancer respectively. Compared to private insurance, being uninsured had OR of 1.61 and 2.45 respectively for kidney and prostate cancers. The OR of an advanced stage diagnosis for bladder and prostate cancer were 3.77 and 1.73, respectively, in counties with a urologist.Increased PCP density and insurance coverage reduced the odds of an advanced diagnosis. Implementation of policies to improve access to healthcare including through increasing PCP density and reducing the number of uninsured patients should result in diagnosis at an earlier stage, which will likely improved cancer-related outcomes.",

Competing risk regression summarised associations of Aboriginal status, stage, geographic attributes and comorbidities with risk of cancer death.A threshold of four or more ECI conditions was associated with increased risk of cancer death (sub-hazard ratio SHR 1.66, 95%CI 1.11-2.46). Alternatively, the presence of any one of a subset of ECI conditions was associated with similarly increased risk (SHR\u202f=\u202f1.62, 95%CI 1.23-2.14). The observed effects did not differ between Aboriginal and matched non-Aboriginal cases. However, Aboriginal cases experienced three times higher exposure than non-Aboriginal to four or more ECI conditions (14.2% versus 4.5%) and greater exposure to the subset of ECI conditions (20.7% versus 8.0%).Comorbidities at diagnosis increased the risk of cancer death in addition to risks associated with Aboriginality, remoteness of residence and disease stage at diagnosis. The Aboriginal cohort experienced comparatively greater exposure to comorbidities which adds to disparities in cancer outcomes.",

Given that stage is incompletely recorded, we investigated the extent to which this indicator reflects underlying organisational differences rather than differences in stage completeness and chance variation.We used population-based data on patients diagnosed with one of ten cancer sites in 2013 (bladder, breast, colorectal, endometrial, lung, ovarian, prostate, renal, NHL, and melanoma). We assessed the degree of bias in CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) indicators introduced by missing-is-late and complete-case specifications compared with an imputed \u2018gold standard\u2019. We estimated the Spearman-Brown (organisation-level) reliability of the complete-case specification. We assessed probable misclassification rates against current pay-for-performance targets.Under the missing-is-late approach, bias in estimated CCG percentage of tumours diagnosed at an early stage ranged from \u22122 to \u221230 percentage points, while bias under the complete-case approach ranged from \u22122 to +7 percentage points. Using an annual reporting period, indicators based on the least biased complete-case approach would have poor reliability, misclassifying 27/209 (13%) CCGs against a pay-for-performance target in current use; only half (53%) of CCGs apparently exceeding the target would be correctly classified in terms of their underlying performance.Current public reporting schemes for cancer stage at diagnosis in England should use a complete-case specification (i.e. the number of staged cases forming the denominator) and be based on three-year reporting periods. Early stage indicators for the studied geographies should not be used in pay-for-performance schemes.",

     "abstract": "Policy decisions about prostate cancer screening require data on the natural history of histological cancers and the resulting impact of screening. However, the gold standard procedure required to identify true positive histological cancer is a full autopsy of the gland which is not possible in screening studies, leading to verification bias. We aim to estimate the sensitivity of a prostate cancer screening round (PSA result to diagnosis) relative to histological cancer.We developed a framework combining data on UK screened and non-screened prostate cancer populations originating from a single round of population-based PSA testing among UK men aged 50\u201369 years, prostate cancer incidence data, and needle biopsy data from the published literature.Sensitivity of a screening round was highest at age 65\u201369 years at 33% (95% CI: 30%\u201337%) and 24% (95% CI: 21%\u201328%) for PSA cut-off levels of 3\u202fng/ml and 4\u202fng/ml, respectively. Sensitivity was lowest at age 50\u201354 at 15% (95% CI: 12%\u201317%) and 9% (95% CI: 8%\u201311%) for PSA cut-off levels of 3\u202fng/ml and 4\u202fng/ml, respectively. In contrast, the clinical detection rate in the absence of mass screening, relative to histological cancer, varied between 0.2%\u20130.7% at age 50\u201354 and 1.2%\u20132.7% at age 65\u201369 from 1995 to 2012.The framework enabled the sensitivity of a prostate cancer screening round relative to histological cancer diagnosis to be estimated and provides a basis to determine the impact and cost-effectiveness of prostate cancer screening. The approach could be adapted to inform the sensitivity of other biomarkers, cancers and screening programmes.",

     "abstract": "This study was aimed to describe the gastric cancer mortality trend, and to analyze the spatial distribution of gastric cancer mortality in Ecuador, between 2004 and 2015.Data were collected from the National Institute of Statistics and Census (INEC) database. Crude gastric cancer mortality rates, standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) and indirect standardized mortality rates (ISMRs) were calculated per 100,000 persons. For time trend analysis, joinpoint regression was used. The annual percentage rate change (APC) and the average annual percent change (AAPC) was computed for each province. Spatial age-adjusted analysis was used to detect high risk clusters of gastric cancer mortality, from 2010 to 2015, using Kulldorff spatial scan statistics.In Ecuador, between 2004 and 2015, gastric cancer caused a total of 19,115 deaths: 10,679 in men and 8436 in women. When crude rates were analyzed, a significant decline was detected (AAPC: \u22121.8%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). ISMR also decreased, but this change was not statistically significant (APC: \u22120.53%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.36). From 2004 to 2007 and from 2008 to 2011 the province with the highest ISMR was Carchi; and, from 2012 to 2015, was Cotopaxi. The most likely high occurrence cluster included Bol\u00edvar, Los R\u00edos, Chimborazo, Tungurahua, and Cotopaxi provinces, with a relative risk of 1.34 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).There is a substantial geographic variation in gastric cancer mortality rates among Ecuadorian provinces. The spatial analysis indicates the presence of high occurrence clusters throughout the Andes Mountains.",

The overall scenario of cancer including hematological malignancies (HMs) is largely unknown in Bangladesh, where a significant proportion of people (44% of total population) belong to AYA age group. This study aims to describe the patterns of HM among AYA in the context of BangladeshTwo previously published datasets (on hematological malignancies and childhood and adolescent cancer) were merged to construct a comprehensive dataset focusing exclusively on HMs in AYA age group. Univariate descriptive statistics were calculated and bivariate association were tested using Pearson\u2019s Chi-square test.A total of 2144 diagnosed HM related cases over a period of 2007\u20132014 were analyzed. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was the most frequent HM (35.1%) in AYAs, which was followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) constituting 22.7% and 20.8%, respectively. Among lymphomas, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) constituted 13.9% of all HMs while 4.6% was for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (HL).This is the first attempt to provide a glimpse on the pattern and distribution of HMs among AYA in Bangladesh. Future studies are essential to get a better insight on the epidemiology, biology, potential risk factors and treatment outcomes for the AYA age group.",

The present study aimed to analyze the diagnosis pattern of childhood malignant diseases using public health data, and to compare this pattern with seasonal viral infection trends.Using the open data source of the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service, we extracted data regarding all patients under 21 years of age and who had any cancer, aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome between September 2009 and December 2013. The positive detection rates of 11 viruses was collected from the surveillance data of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and seasonality analysis were conducted with both data.In total, 9085 patients were diagnosed with malignant disease during the study period; there were about 175 new cases per month on average. Monthly stacked time series by year showed an apparent seasonal variation with the highest monthly average in January as 236, and the lowest in September as 120. In winter, significantly more patients were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, neuroblastoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma than in other seasons. There was a temporal correlation with the diagnostic trends of several diseases and the prevalence of recent human parainfluenza virus.This study tentatively suggests that the diagnosis of childhood malignancy follows a seasonal trend in Korea, and has a possible correlation with viral prevalence in several diseases. Further long-term analysis of epidemiological data is needed to explore possible causality.",

A linear dose\u2013response association was observed between oral cancer and chewing tobacco in terms of age at initiation, duration, and frequency of chewing per day (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

This study aims to identify factors associated with self-rated health in elderly people with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.Cross-sectional study performed at a cancer referral hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, included 162 patients, aged 60 or more years. All patients received a Multidimensional Geriatric Assessment, including seven health dimensions, and socio-demographic, epidemiological and it were collected clinical data. Descriptive analyses were performed and prevalence ratios were calculated to assess associations between self-rated health and the independent variables. Multivariate analysis was performed using Poisson\u2019s regression, to a \u22640.05 level of statistical significance.The study population mean age was 68.8 (SD\u00a0=\u00a07.1) years; most were women, lived with a partner and had little education. Prevalence of fair/poor self-rated health was 33.6%. Being female, not living with a partner, functional dependence, depressive symptoms and nutritional risk/malnutrion showed associations with fair/poor self-rated health. In the multiple model, dependence in instrumental activities of daily living (PR 2.96; 95%CI 1.66-5.30) and presence of depressive symptoms (PR 1.78; 95%CI 1.15-2.75) remained associated with fair/poor health.Variation in perceived health status supports the hypothesis that self-rated health is related to multiple issues, regardless of disease status. The risk profile for poor self-rated health identified may be a useful tool in care for older cancer patients, as it points to those at higher risk of adverse health outcomes.",

Last, a health services audit for cancer using the WHO SARA tool was undertaken.Breast and cervical cancer remain the first and second most commonly identified cancers in the Solomon Islands. The Solomons cancer registry is hospital based and suffers from incomplete data collection due to its passive nature, lack of resources for data entry and processing resulting in weak data which is rarely used for decision-making. The health system audit revealed system and individual reasons for delayed diagnosis or lack of cancer treatment or palliation in the Solomon Islands. Reasons included lack of patient knowledge regarding symptoms, late referrals to the National Referral Hospital and inability of health care workers to detect cancers either due to lack of skills to do so, or lack of diagnostic capabilities, and an overall lack of access to any health care, due to geographical barriers and overall national economic fragility.The Solomon Islands is challenged in preventing, diagnosing, treating and palliating cancer. Stakeholders recommend establishing specialty expertise (in the form of a cancer unit), improved registry processes and increased collaboration between the sole tertiary hospital nationwide and other Solomon health services as important targets for incremental improvement.",

This study reviews data on cancer incidence and mortality in the PICTs, with special focus on indigenous populations.PICTs with populations of <1.5 million (\u2018small nations\u2019) were included in this study. Information on cancer incidence and mortality was extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database. Scientific and grey literature was narratively reviewed for publications published after 2000.Of the 21 PICTs, seven countries were included in the GLOBOCAN 2012 (Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, New Caledonia, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu). The highest cancer incidence and mortality rates were reported in New Caledonia (age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 297.9 and 127.3 per 100.000) and French Polynesia (age-standardized incidence and mortality rates 255.0 and 134.4 per 100.000), with relatively low rates in other countries. Literature indicated that cancer was among the leading causes of deaths in most PICTs; thus they now experience a double burden of cancers linked to infections and life-style and reproductive factors. Further, ethnic differences in cancer incidence and mortality have been reported in some PICTs, including Fiji, Guam, New Caledonia and Northern Mariana Islands.Cancer incidence in the PICTs was recorded to be relatively low, with New Caledonia and French Polynesia being exceptions. Low recorded incidence is likely to be explained by incomplete cancer registration as cancer had an important contribution to mortality. Further endeavors are needed to develop and strengthen cancer registration infrastructure and practices and to improve data quality and registration coverage in the PICTs.",

Although breast cancer incidence was significantly lower in Guam compared to Hawaii, women in Guam presented at younger ages and with rarer disease histologies such as inflammatory carcinoma were more prevalent. Guam patients were also diagnosed at younger ages for cancers of bladder, pancreas, colon & rectum, liver & intrahepatic bile duct, lung & bronchus, stomach, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and leukemia.Smoking, infectious agents, and betel nut chewing appear to be important contributors to the burden of cancer in Guam.

Both procedures were applied to datasets simulated to match published results in the Girona Province of Spain. We also present the use of the q-interval in displaying the temporal pattern of the events. This approach is demonstrated by analyses of CMML diagnoses in Girona County (1994\u20132008).The Cuscore was clearly more efficient than regression in detecting the simulated trend. The relative efficiency of the Cuscore is likely to be maintained in even higher levels of incidence. The use of graphical displays in providing clues regarding interpretation of the results is demonstrated.The Cuscore test coupled with visual inspection of the temporal pattern of the events seems to be more efficient than regression analysis in detecting and interpreting data suspected to be at elevated risk. A confirmatory analysis is expected to weed out 75% of the superfluous significant results.",

It was conducted in hopes of identifying a cost-efficient non-probability sampling strategy that could generate reasonable population estimates for both minority and general populations.RDS data was collected in Guam in 2013 (n\u00a0=\u00a0511) and population estimates were compared with 2012 BRFSS data (n\u00a0=\u00a02031) and the 2010 census data. The estimates were calculated using the unweighted RDS sample and the weighted sample using RDS inference methods and compared with known population characteristics.The sample size was reached in 23\u00a0days, providing evidence that the RDS method is a viable, cost-effective data collection method, which can provide reasonable population estimates. However, the results also suggest that the RDS inference methods used to reduce bias, based on self-reported estimates of network sizes, may not always work. Caution is needed when interpreting RDS study findings.For a more diverse sample, data collection should not be conducted in just one location. Fewer questions about network estimates should be asked, and more careful consideration should be given to the kind of incentives offered to participants.",

The Children's Healthy Living (CHL) Program included an areca (betel) nut questionnaire in a survey of household characteristics in the Freely Associated States (FAS). This paper describes areca (betel) nut chewing practices of adults and the health behaviors of their children.A cross-section of 1200 children (2\u20138 year-olds) and their caregivers in Chuuk, Kosrae, Pohnpei, Republic of Palau, Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and Yap were recruited. Socio-demographics, adult areca (betel) nut chewing practices, and other health behaviors of children and adults were assessed. Child anthropometric measurements were collected to estimate weight status.The FAS areca (betel) nut chewing prevalence was 42%, ranging from 3% (RMI) to 94% (Yap). Among chewers, 84% added tobacco, 97% added slaked lime, 85% added betel leaf, and 24% mixed the components with alcohol. Among FAS children, 95% practiced daily teeth-brushing and 53% visited the dentist annually. Compared to non-chewing households, areca (betel) nut chewing households were more likely to have very young children enrolled, more highly educated adults, and members that used tobacco and alcohol.The FAS areca (betel) nut chewing prevalence (42%) is above the world prevalence of 10\u201320%, with wide variability across the islands. The oral health findings in this study may inform future oral cancer prevention programs or policies. Regular monitoring of areca (betel) nut use is needed to measure the impact of such programs or policies.",

Increasing attention has been paid to the lack of service of radiation therapy or radiotherapy in Fiji.This study aims to estimate and compare the costs and benefits of introducing radiation oncology services in Fiji from the societal perspective.Time horizon for cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was 15 years from 2021 to 2035. The benefits and costs were converted to the present values of 2016. Estimates for the CBA model were taken from previous studies and expert opinions and data obtained from field visits to Fiji in January 2016. Sensitivity analyses with changing assumptions were undertaken.The estimated net benefit, applying the national minimum wage (NMW) to measure monetary value for life-year gained, was \u221231,624,421 FJD with 0.69 of benefit-cost (B/C) ratio. If gross national income (GNI) per capita was used for the value of life years, net benefit was 3,975,684 FJD (B/C ratio: 1.04). With a pessimistic scenario, establishing the center appeared to be not cost-beneficial, and the net benefit was \u221253,634,682 FJD (B/C ratio: 0.46); net benefit with an optimistic scenario was estimated 23,178,189 FJD (B/C ratio: 1.20).Based on the CBA results from using GNI per capita instead of the NMW, this project would be cost-beneficial. Introducing a radiation oncology center in Fiji would have potential impacts on financial sustainability, financial protection, and accessibility and equity of the health system.",

The USAPI grantees report data on screening and follow-up activities to the CDC.We examined cervical cancer screening and follow-up data from the NBCCEDP programs in the four USAPIs from 2007 to 2015. We summarized screening done by Papanicolaou (Pap) and oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) tests, follow-up and diagnostic tests provided, and histology results observed.A total of 22,249 Pap tests were conducted in 14,206 women in the four USAPIs programs from 2007\u20132015. The overall percentages of abnormal Pap results (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse) was 2.4% for first program screens and 1.8% for subsequent program screens. Histology results showed a high proportion of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (57%) among women with precancers and cancers. Roughly one-third (32%) of Pap test results warranting follow-up had no data recorded on diagnostic tests or follow-up done.This is the first report of cervical cancer screening and outcomes of women served in the USAPI through the NBCCEDP with similar results for abnormal Pap tests, but higher proportion of precancers and cancers, when compared to national NBCCEDP data. The USAPI face significant challenges in implementing cervical cancer screening, particularly in providing and recording data on diagnostic tests and follow-up. The screening programs in the USAPI should further examine specific barriers to follow-up of women with abnormal Pap results and possible solutions to address them.",

Stakeholders were then involved in a series of individual and group meetings over a 2-year period to build confidence and encourage progressively greater engagement.In total, 87 individuals from 46 organisations were identified. Over the 2-year process, the individual and group meetings facilitated a change in stakeholder attitudes from disinterest, to acceptance and finally to active cooperation in designing the screening programme and preparing an implementation plan that were both well adapted to the Moldovan context.Developing the broad support needed to implement cervical screening programmes required ongoing interaction with stakeholders over an extended period. This interaction allowed stakeholder concerns to be identified and addressed, progress to be demonstrated, and stakeholders to be educated about organised screening programmes so they had the knowledge to progressively take greater responsibility and ownership.",

There are credible study data showing an increased relative risk with long-term use of CCBs, but the results of our meta-analysis and of meta-regression of log relative risk against minimum follow-up time are mixed. The current summative evidence does not support a clear association between taking CCBs and developing breast cancer. However, uncertainty remains, especially for long-term use and any association might not be uniform between different populations and/or breast cancer sub-types.

     "abstract": "Tomasetti and Vogelstein have hypothesized that the patterns of cancer incidence in various cells and tissues are highly correlated with the estimated lifetime number of stem cell divisions. The authors reviewed the risks in tissues of 17 types of cancer from the United States and 69 additional countries. Positive correlations were observed consistently between the tissue \u2212 specific cancer incidence and the estimated lifetime number of stem cell divisions. The authors concluded that approximately two-thirds of global cancer incidence may be attributed to random DNA replication errors.An epidemiologic perspective is presented that may serve as a counterpoint in interpreting organ-specific cancer risks. The unifying nature of the Tomasetti/Vogelstein hypothesis must be viewed in the context of diverse and contrasting global trends and patterns of types and \u201ccauses\u201d of cancers that are closely linked with economic development and cultural lifestyle practices. The presentation is organized by reviewing the global burden of cancer; concepts of causal inferences and counterfactual assumptions; multifactorial causes of hepatocellular carcinoma and a hierarchy of causes that varies internationally; tobacco carcinogenesis and the multiplex associations with 19 cancer sites and tissues; profile in contrasts in transit through the small and large intestine.It is readily recognized that DNA replication errors and number of stem cell divisions may vary in individuals and populations due to external environmental genotoxic chemicals and biologic agents, and internal hormonal and metabolic factors. There is a striking contrast in the risk of adenocarcinoma in the small intestine with that in the large intestine. Tomasetti and Vogelstein indicated that the cumulative number of divisions of stem cells over a lifetime in normal epithelial mucosal cells from colorectal cancer patients was 4 time greater than in the epithelial tissue from patients with adenocarcinoma of the small intestine. Their conclusion would suggest a \u201cseed\u201d and \u201csoil\u201d interaction rather than exclusively the independence of either component. Namely, that the contrasting physiological, biochemical, microbial and immunological features in the lumen and on the mucosal surface of the large intestine, in contrast to that in the small intestine, would foster molecular genetic and epigenetic events that are advantageous to neoplasia in the large intestine.",

Meta-analyses were found to be of fair to good quality while systematic reviews were found to be of less than fair quality. Factors associated with higher scores of quality in the multivariable analysis were including primary studies consisting of randomized control trials, performing a meta-analysis, and applying a recommended guideline related to establishing a systematic review protocol and/or reporting.Systematic reviews and meta-analyses may introduce a high risk of bias if applied to inform decision-making based on AMSTAR.

Incidences rates (IRs) were standardized to the 2013 European population and annual percentage changes (EAPC) were estimated using a piecewise log linear model. 1- and 5-year observed (OS) and relative survival (RS) were also calculated. Results were expressed by sex, age-group, histological subtype and behavior.The overall IR was 16.85 and increased across the period of study (EAPC\u00a0=\u00a0+2.2%). The proportion and IRs of malignant (50.2%; IR\u00a0=\u00a09.35) and non-malignant cases (49.8%; IR\u00a0=\u00a09.14) were similar; however, non-malignant tumors were more frequent in women (sex ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.63).

When veterans possibly exposed to environmental contaminants associated with demolition of the Khamisiyah Ammunition Storage Facility at Khamisiyah, Iraq, have been compared to contemporaneously deployed unexposed veterans, the results have suggested increased risk for mortality from brain cancer among the exposed. Brain cancer mortality risk in this cohort has not been updated since 2004.This study analyzes the risk for brain cancer mortality between 1991\u20132011 through two series of comparisons: U.S. Gulf War deployed and non-deployed veterans from the same era; and veterans possibly exposed to environmental contaminants at Khamisiyah compared to contemporaneously deployed but unexposed U.S. Gulf War veterans. Risk of brain cancer mortality was determined using logistic regression. Life test hazard models were created to plot comparisons of annual hazard rates. Joinpoint regression models were applied to assess trends in hazard rates for brain cancer mortality.U.S. Army veterans possibly exposed at Khamisiyah had similar rates of brain cancer mortality compared to those not possibly exposed; however, veterans possibly exposed had a higher risk of brain cancer in the time period immediately following the Gulf War.Results from these analyses suggest that veterans possibly exposed at Khamisiyah experienced different patterns of brain cancer mortality risk compared to the other groups.",

This study aimed to determine the epidemiology (prevalence, incidence, and risk factors) and functional outcomes of tracheal invasion from thyroid cancer among Japanese patients who were eligible for full-layer tracheal resection.Patients with thyroid cancer and with or without tracheal invasion were identified based on procedure codes using a large inpatient database that is maintained by a data vendor. The prevalence and incidence were estimated for each age and sex using Japanese volume of thyroidectomies and Japanese population data. We also explored whether a tumor-related tracheal defect was successfully reconstructed after full-layer tracheal resection.Among the 8482 patients with thyroid cancer, the overall prevalence of tracheal invasion was 0.4\u20130.7%. The overall incidence of thyroid cancer was 12.0/100,000 persons, and the incidence of tracheal invasion was estimated to be 0.05\u20130.09/100,000 persons. The age distributions were noticeably different between thyroid cancer cases with and without tracheal invasion. The highest incidence was observed at ages of 70\u201379 years for thyroid cancer with tracheal invasion and 60\u201369 years for thyroid cancer without invasion. Approximately one-half of patients experienced long-term use of a tracheal tube and/or multiple operations for tracheal reconstruction.The peak incidence of tracheal invasion from thyroid cancer was observed at ages of >70\u00a0years. In addition, conventional surgical management appears to be limited in its ability to reconstruct tracheal defects.",

This study aims to determine whether there has been an evolution in incidence and survival of penile cancer over time in France.Rates of age world-standardized incidence (ASRW) and net survival (NS) between 1989 and 2011 were calculated using data from 16 French cancer registries. Time trend incidence and survival analysis were confined to the eight registries operating throughout the full period. Log-linear Poisson regression analysis was used to estimate the average annual percentage change (AAPC) in incidence rates. The incidence rate for the most recent period was also calculated from all 16 cancer registries operating during 2009\u20132011. Human papillomavirus (HPV) exposure was deduced from the morphological code. NS was estimated using the Pohar\u2013Perme estimator of the net cumulative rate.No significant change in incidence was observed between 1989 and 2011 (AAPC: 0.08%; 95%CI: \u22121.01%; +1.17%). The incidence increased with age. The ASRW in 16 registries operating in 2009\u20132011 was 0.59 per 100,000 (95%CI: 0.50\u20130.68). The proportion of cases potentially linked to HPV was nearly 11% and did not change significantly over time. NS decreased with age but did not change over time (around 65% at 5 years).Penile cancer remains rare in France, but survival is still low \u2212 probably because of delays in diagnosis and limited improvements in care.

Genetic risk score, as proxy for actual measured telomere length, derived from nine telomere length-associated genetic variants was used to evaluate the effect of telomere length on HCC risk.We observed a significant risk signal between genetically increased telomere length and HBV-related HCC risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.09, 95% CI 1.32\u20133.31, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

     "abstract": "We present the 15-year experience of a family colorectal cancer screening service in Ireland with emphasis on real life experience and outcomes.Questionnaires were used to assess family cancer history and assign patients to risk categories; \u2018Moderate Risk\u2019, HNPCC, (suspected) genetic syndrome (non-HNPCC), \u2018Low Risk\u2019. Screening was by full colonoscopy. We report neoplastic yield, examining effect of risk category, age, gender, and index colonoscopy findings.Between 1998 and 2013, 2242 individuals were referred; 57.3% female, 42.7% male, median age 46 years (range9-85yrs). Median follow up time was 7.9yrs (range 0.5-15.3yrs). Follow up data after exclusion (non-compliance, known CRC) was available in 1496 (66.7%): \u2018Moderate risk\u2019 785 (52.5%), HNPCC 256 (17.1%), (suspected) genetic syndrome (non-HNPCC) 85 (5.7%), \u2018Low Risk\u2019 370 (24.7%). Screening was performed in 1025(68.5%) patients; colonoscopy data available for 993 (96.9%); total 1914 colonoscopies. At index colonoscopy, 178 (18.0%) patients had adenomas; 56 (5.5%) advanced adenoma. During the entire study period, 240 (24.2%) had an adenoma; 69 (7.0%) advanced adenoma. Cancers were diagnosed on screening in 2 patients. Older age and male gender were associated with higher adenoma detection rate; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, respectively. Risk category did not affect adenoma yield. Adenoma and advanced adenoma detection at index colonoscopy were associated with detection of same at follow up screening; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001.Male gender and age (>50) were the core identifiable risk factors for neoplasia at screening colonoscopy in this family screening setting. Our results would support less intensive surveillance in younger patients (<50), particularly where index colonoscopy is normal.",

     "abstract": "To assess the efficacy of screening with concurrent liquid-based cytology and human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for primary cervical cancer screening, we initiated a randomized trial entitled CervIcal cancer screening Trial by Randomization of HPV testing intervention for Upcoming Screening (CITRUS).Between June 2013 and March 2015, women aged 30\u201364 years of age who participated in a regular cervical cancer screening program (every 2 years) were invited to enrollment of our study. After giving their informed consent, 18,402 women were randomly assigned to liquid-based cytology as the control group (n\u00a0=\u00a09145) or to HPV DNA testing with liquid-based cytology as the intervention group (n\u00a0=\u00a09257). We subsequently compared the incidence rate of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), the rate of false positive tests and the rate of overdiagnosis, as well as assessing the risks and benefits of receiving screening for women in both groups. The primary outcome of our study was the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) during the study period of around 6 years.In the control group, 97.9% of women were NILM, and 2.06% ASC-US or worse (ASC-US+). In the intervention group, 87.13% of women were NILM/HPV negative, 0.72% ASC-US/HPV negative, 10.34% NILM/HPV positive, 0.69% ASC-US/HPV positive, 0.90% worse than ASC-US/either HPV. Positive HPV testing was not linearly related to age in our study.Insights from CITRUS will provide future prospects for cervical cancer screening focused on the use of HPV testing in Japan.Clinical trial registration number: NCT01895517, UMIN000010843, TRIUC1312.",

     "abstract": "Prostate and breast cancer screening in older patients continue to be controversial. Balancing the desire for early detection with avoidance of over-diagnosis has led to competing and contradictory guidelines for both practices. Despite similarities, it is not known how these screening practices are related at the regional level. In this study, we examined how screening PSA and mammography are related within healthcare regions, and, to better understand what may be driving these practices, whether they are associated with local intensity of care.We performed a retrospective cross-sectional study of fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries in 2012. For each of 306 hospital referral regions (HRRs), we calculated rates of PSA screening for men aged \u226568 years, as well as rates of screening mammography for women aged \u226575 years, adjusted for age and race. Additionally, we determined regional rates of \u201chealthcare intensity\u201d, including spending on tests and procedures, and intensity of end-of-life care. Pearson correlations of adjusted rates were calculated within HRRs.The mean adjusted rate of PSA screening was 22%. The mean age of screened and unscreened patients was 75.0 and 77.4 years, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The mean adjusted rate of screening mammography was 23%; mean ages of screened and non-screened women were 79.95 and 83.67, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). HRR-level PSA screening rates were independent of screening mammography rates (r\u00a0=\u00a00.06, p\u00a0=\u00a00.31). PSA screening rates were associated with spending on testing and procedures (r\u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and various measures of intensity of EOL care (e.g. r\u00a0=\u00a00.40, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for mechanical ventilator use). Screening mammography had low correlation with both health care spending and EOL care intensity measures (all r-values <0.3).Regional rates of PSA screening rates were independent of screening mammography, thus these practices appear to be driven by different factors. Unlike mammography, PSA screening was associated with local enthusiasm for testing and treatment. Efforts to reduce over-testing should contemplate these practices differently, and future research should examine the factors motivating these screening practices.",

We estimated the cumulative incidence of metachronous (diagnosed >2\u00a0months after first primary cancer [FPC]) SPC in gastric FPC patients and compared the incidence of metachronous SPC with that expected in the general population.A cohort of gastric FPC patients from the North Region Cancer Registry of Portugal, diagnosed in 2000\u20132006 (n\u00a0=\u00a07427) was followed to 31 December 2010 for synchronous and metachronous SPCs. Cumulative incidence of metachronous SPCs taking into account death as a competing event and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of metachronous SPCs were estimated.Overall, 331 (4.5%) patients developed an SPC (26.9% synchronous and 73.1% metachronous). Over half of the SPCs occurred in digestive organs. Among men, the most frequent were colon, prostate, and trachea, bronchus and lung; in women, colon, breast and thyroid were the most common. The 10-year cumulative incidence of metachronous SPC for males was 5.7% and for females 3.5%. The SIR for all cancers was 1.30 in males and 1.20 in females. Among both sexes, significantly higher SIRs were observed for cancers of the oesophagus (males: 4.99; females: 8.03), small intestine (males: 11.04; females: 13.09) and colon (males: 2.42; females: 2.58).Patients with a gastric FPC were found to be at increased risk of developing SPC, mainly in digestive organs, when compared to the general population. Close surveillance of these patients may allow early detection of SPC.",

We investigated the association between belief about breast cancer causation and self-reported shift work exposure in a case-control study.Women completed a questionnaire asking whether they believed that shift work caused cancer either before or after reporting their history of shift work. We measured: whether belief modified the association between reported shift work and disease; whether belief was associated with reported shift work exposure; and whether being prompted to recall shift work exposure was associated with an increased likelihood of believing that shift work increased breast cancer risk.There was a significant association between believing shift work increased breast cancer risk and reporting exposure to shift work. Being prompted to recall shift work was not associated with a belief that shift work increased risk.The association between pre-existing belief about breast cancer risk and reported shift work is likely to be due to exposed individuals believing that exposure increases risk, rather than resulting from recall bias.",

     "abstract": "The objective of this review was to systematically appraise the existing published literature about community-based cervical cancer screening programs that have used visual inspection methods using acetic acid (VIA) in India. All peer reviewed journal articles till December 2015 were searched per PRISMA guidelines. Articles reporting results from cervical cancer screening programs in community-based settings, conducted in India, and using VIA were included in this review. The search resulted in 20 articles to be included in the review with a total of 313,553 women at 12 unique urban and rural sites across India. Seventeen (85%) studies were cross-sectional and three studies were randomized controlled trials; most studies compared accuracy of VIA with other screening tests such as visual inspection using Lugol\u2019s Iodine (VILI), HPV DNA, and cytology. Of studies that reported test accuracy for CIN Grade 2+, the VIA sensitivity values ranged from 16.6\u201382.6% and specificity ranged from 82.1\u201396.8%. Women between age groups of 30\u201359 years were recruited using motivational one-on-one counseling and local support staff. All studies conducted diagnostic follow-up using colposcopy and guided biopsies, when necessary. Three major themes were identified that facilitated implementation of screening programs in a community-based setting: standardized training that maintained competency of test providers; collaborations with community-based organizations that used health education for recruitment of participants; and employing the screen-and-treat method to reduce loss to follow-up. Summarized evidence presented in this review could substantially influence future implementation and sustainment of cervical cancer screening programs at a national level.",

We aimed to assess cancer incidence in miners relative to the general population and identify high-risk subgroups.Incident cancers in Western Australian miners (n\u00a0=\u00a0153,922; 86% male) during 1996\u20132013 were identified. Indirectly standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated and mixed-effects Poisson models were used to calculate Incidence Rate Ratios (IRRs) to identify high-risk within-cohort subgroups.Compared with the general population, the overall cancer incidence in miners (n\u00a0=\u00a04194 cases) was lower for both females (SIR:0.83, 95%CI:0.74\u20130.92) and males (SIR:0.96, 95%CI:0.93\u20130.99). Overall, cancer incidence did not differ by employment duration or employment commencement time. Ever-underground work was associated with lung cancer (IRR:1.81, 95%CI:1.11\u20132.93). Relative to multi-ore miners, IRRs for specific cancers were significantly different when exclusively mining: iron (prostate:0.73, 95%CI:0.56\u20130.94); gold (lung:1.77, 95%CI:1.04\u20133.01 and colorectum:1.70, 95%CI:1.16\u20132.51); and other metals (urinary tract:1.85, 95%CI:1.03\u20133.31 and leukaemia:0.36, 95%CI:0.14\u20130.96).Working underground emerged as a significant determinant of lung cancer risk in our contemporary mining cohort. Increased risks of lung, prostate, colorectal and urinary tract cancers and leukaemia were identified in miners of specific ores. These findings underline the importance of continued surveillance of the health and exposures of this relatively young cohort of miners.",

We calculated the cross-correlation among the historical series of smoking prevalence and lung cancer mortality rate (LCMR) to estimate the most likely time gap between both series. We also predicted the magnitude and timing of the LCMR peak.All cross-correlations were statistically significant and positive (all above 0.8). For men, the most likely gap ranges from 20 to 34 years. The age-adjusted LCMR increased by 3.2 deaths per 100,000 people for every 1 unit increase in the smoking prevalence 29 years earlier. The highest rate for men was observed in 1995 (55.6 deaths). For women, the most likely gap ranges from 10 to 37 years.

The maximum rate is expected to occur in 2026 (10.3 deaths).The time series of prevalence of tobacco smoking explains the mortality from lung cancer with a distance (or gap) of around 30 years. According to the lagged smoking prevalence, the lung cancer mortality among men is declining while in women continues to rise (maximum expected in 2026).",

Data was extracted from the hospital\u2019s electronic medical record. Survival differences among different racial and ethnic groups were examined graphically using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A univariate cox proportional hazards model and a multivariable adjusted model were generated.Black patients had significantly lower overall survival compared to White patients, with median overall survival of 1.9 years and 2.5 years respectively. In a multivariate analysis, Black race posed a significant hazard (HR 1.70, CI 1.01\u20132.90, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0467) for death.

Cox regression was used to identify factors associated with metastatic progression.After a median 5.3 years follow-up, 26.4% of the 12757 cases initially diagnosed with localised or regional colon cancer had developed metastatic disease, as had 29.5% of the 7154 rectal cancer cases. For both cancer sites, risk of metastatic progression was significantly higher for those initially diagnosed with regional disease (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.49 for colon, 2.66 for rectal cancer), and for older cases (e.g. aHR for >79\u00a0years vs <60\u00a0years: 1.38 for colon, 1.69 for rectal cancer). Risk of disease progression was significantly lower for females, and varied by histology type. For colon cancer, the risk of disease progression decreased over time. For rectal cancer, risk of metastatic progression was significantly higher for those living in more socioeconomically disadvantaged areas compared with those in the least disadvantaged area.An understanding of the variation in risk of metastatic progression is useful for planning health service requirements, and can help inform decisions about treatment and follow-up for colorectal cancer patients.",

This study estimates completeness and variation between early and late registrations in the N.

For the period 2010\u20132012, incidence reported in the first year of data publication was compared to incidence reported in subsequent years until 2015. Demographic characteristics and survival of incident cases ascertained before the first publication year were compared to those ascertained in subsequent years. The flow method approach was used to estimate completeness annually after the incident year.Overall incidence for all cancers increased between the first year of data publication and subsequent years up to 2015, irrespective of year of diagnosis. Late registrations had poorer survival. The flow method approach estimated the completeness of case ascertainment of NICR data to be 96% complete at five years for all cancers combined.The estimated completeness levels for the NICR are comparable to other high quality cancer registries internationally. While data timeliness has little impact on incidence estimates, delays in registration may have implications for specific research studies into incidence and survival. This means that improvements in the timeliness of reporting should be a target for all registries but not at the expense of completeness.",

Compared with non-clustered counties, clustered counties were more likely in the south (72.9% versus 42.1%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and in non-urban communities (73.2% versus 57.4, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Clustered counties had greater particulate-matter pollution, lower education and income, higher rates of obesity and physical inactivity, less access to healthcare, and greater unemployment rates (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Higher levels of particulate-matter pollution (4th quartile versus 1st quartile) were associated with two-fold greater odds of being a clustered county (adjusted OR: 2.10; 95%CI: 1.23\u20133.59).We observed a belt of counties with high lung mortality ranging from eastern Oklahoma through central Appalachia; these counties were characterized by higher pollution, a more rural population, lower socioeconomic status and poorer access to healthcare. To mitigate the burden of lung cancer mortality in the US, both urban and rural areas should consider minimizing air pollution.",

We retrieved information on germline BRCAm testing from Clinical Genetics departments and clinical/treatment characteristics from population-based medical registries. Follow-up for recurrence, new primary cancer, and mortality extended from 180\u00a0days after diagnosis until 31/12/2012. We estimated median DFS and OS and five-year cumulative incidence and incidence rates (IR/1000 person-years), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), for each outcome.Among 9874 patients, 523 (5%) underwent BRCA testing\u201490 were BRCAm carriers, 433 were BRCA wildtype (BRCAwt). Compared with BRCAwt women, BRCAm carriers were younger, had lower stage, and ER- and HER2- tumors. Median time from diagnosis to BRCA testing was 0.91 years and 1.3 years in BRCAm and BRCAwt women; median follow-up to first event was 3.9 and 3.4 years, respectively.

Using two databases with excellent recurrence and death information, we examined determinants of survival duration after recurrence of breast (BC), colorectal (CRC), and lung cancers (LC).Recurrence status was abstracted from the medical records of patients who participated in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance study and who received care at two Cancer Research Network sites\u2014the Colorado and Northwest regions of Kaiser Permanente. The analysis included 1653 patients who developed recurrence after completing definitive therapy for stages I\u2013III cancer. Multivariable modeling identified independent determinants of survival duration after recurrence, controlling for other factors.Through 60 months\u2019 average follow-up, survival after recurrence for BC, CRC, and LC were 28.4, 23.1 and 16.1 months, respectively.

Factors associated with shorter survival for selected cancers included: distant/regional recurrence for BC and CRC; current/former smoker for LC; high grade for CRC; and <4-year time-to-recurrence for BC.Initial stage predicts survival duration after recurrence, whereas time-to-recurrence usually does not. The impact of biologic characteristics (e.g., grade, hormone-receptor status) on survival duration after recurrence needs further study. Predictors of survival duration after recurrence may help facilitate patient decision-making.",

Hospitalizations are an indicator of the burden of late effects. We identify rates and risk factors for hospitalization from five to ten years after diagnosis for childhood and adolescent ALL survivors compared to siblings and a matched population sample.176 ALL survivors were diagnosed at \u226422 years between 1998 and 2008 and treated at an Intermountain Healthcare facility. The Utah Population Database identified siblings, an age- and sex-matched sample of the Utah population, and statewide inpatient hospital discharges. Sex- and birth year-adjusted Poisson models with Generalized Estimating Equations and robust standard errors calculated rates and rate ratios. Cox proportional hazards models identified demographic and clinical risk factors for hospitalizations among survivors.Hospitalization rates for survivors (Rate:3.76, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.22\u20136.36) were higher than siblings (Rate:2.69, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u20137.18) and the population sample (Rate:1.87, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.13\u20133.09).

Furthermore, few cohort studies have examined the association of exogenous hormone use, including type and duration, with this disease.

Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the associations of interest.Being parous vs. nulliparous was associated with reduced risk (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.84, 95% CI 0.70\u20131.00), and women who had 1\u20132 and 3\u20134 births were at decreased risk compared to nulliparous women, whereas women who had >5 births showed no decrease in risk.

Patients were identified from Welsh Cancer Services records and relevant data was extracted from electronic National Health Service (NHS) databases. Main outcome measures were median overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and perioperative adverse events. Hazard ratio estimation was carried out with Cox Regression analysis and survival determined by Kaplan-Meier plots.Of 220 women with AOC, 32.3% underwent primary debulking surgery (PDS) and 67.7% primary chemotherapy and interval debulking (PCT-IDS). Patients were often elderly (median age 67 years) with a poor performance status (26.5% PS >1). Complete cytoreduction (0\u00a0cm residual) was achieved in 32.4% of patients in the PDS group and in 50.0% of patients undergoing IDS. Median OS for all patients was 21.9 months (PDS: 27.0 and PCT-IDS: 19.2 months; p >\u00a00.05) and median PFS was 13.1 months (PDS: 14.3 months and PCT-IDS: 13.0 months; p >\u00a00.05). Median overall and progression free survival for patients achieving complete cytoreduction were 48.0 and 23.2 months respectively in the PDS group and 35.4 months and 18.6 months in the IDS group (p >\u00a00.05).This retrospective study of an unselected, consecutive cohort of women with AOC in South West Wales shows comparable survival outcomes with recently published trials, despite the relatively advanced age and poor performance status of our patient cohort. Over the seven-year study period, our data also demonstrated a non-significant trend towards improved survival following primary surgery in patients who achieved maximal cytoreduction.

Conversely, risk was not increased in late follow-up (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.36, 95% C.I. 0.65\u20132.83).These data confirm a prospective association between higher serum calcium and ovarian cancer. An association in early, but not late, follow-up suggests that the higher calcium reflects the presence of existing cancer. A positive association with serum albumin is novel and should be interpreted cautiously.",

Knowledge of patient safety during follow-up is sparse.To examine patient-reported errors during cancer follow-up and identify factors associated with errors.A national survey on cancer patients\u2019 experiences of treatment and aftercare was conducted in 2012, about two years following cancer diagnosis (N\u00a0=\u00a06914). Associations between patient-reported errors during follow-up and covariates were examined using multiple logistic regression. Qualitative responses were analysed using text analysis.This study included 3731 patients, representing a response rate of 64%. Overall, 27.6% of patients reported at least one error during cancer follow-up. 11.7% reported that important information was missing at follow-up consultations; 9.8% were not called in for a follow-up as expected; 16.7% reported that the doctor/nurse handling the follow-up consultation were ill-prepared on their course of disease. Other errors were reported by 4.7%. Patients who reported errors in follow-up were more likely to report an error or complication during primary cancer treatment, not having one health professional with oversight and responsibility for their overall follow-up pathway, be younger, have a diagnosis of rare cancer, poorer self-rated health and high usage of healthcare services.Workflows related to handling of test results, referrals, bookings and medical records have to be improved. Introduction of one particular healthcare professional responsible for the patients\u2019 follow-up may result in fewer patient-reported errors however interventions are needed to examine this. Patients prone to errors should be subject to particular attention.",

Concern has been raised that the faster diagnosis may have introduced lead-time bias by elongating the period from diagnosis to death.We aimed to analyse the possible effect of lead time on survival due to expedited cancer diagnosis after the implementation of national CPPs among incident cancer patients diagnosed through Danish primary care.We used actual observed differences in diagnostic intervals to estimate the lead-time effect. We used data from sub-cohorts from the Danish Cancer in Primary Care (CaP) cohort of first-time cancer patients: before and after CPP implementation. To calculate differences in absolute survival, we estimated the survival function after advancing the date of diagnosis in the before cohort to an earlier point in time and hereby adjusting for lead time for nine cancer types and all combined by using Kaplan-Meier analysis.Advancing the date of diagnosis implied that the absolute one-year survival increased from 68.5% to 69.4%. This accounted for 13% of the observed differences in absolute one-year survival from before to after CPPs.The lead time caused by shorter diagnostic intervals after implementation of Cancer Patient Pathways seems to explain less than 15% of the observed changes in the one-year survival estimates for cancer patients in Denmark.",

A 1977 landmark paper of US scientists Fears, Scotto, and Schneiderman advanced a novel hypothesis whereby cutaneous melanoma was primarily caused by intermittent sun exposure (i.e. periodic, brief episodes of exposure to high-intensity ultraviolet radiation) while the keratinocyte cancers, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, were primarily caused by progressive accumulation of sun exposure. With respect to cutaneous melanoma, this became known as the intermittent exposure hypothesis. The hypothesis stemmed from analysis of measured ambient ultraviolet radiation and age-specific incidence rates of melanoma and keratinocyte cancers collected as an extension to the US Third National Cancer Survey in several US States. In this perspective paper, we put this novel hypothesis into the context of knowledge at the time, and describe subsequent epidemiological and molecular research into melanoma that elaborated the intermittent exposure hypothesis and ultimately replaced it with a dual pathway hypothesis. Our present understanding is of two distinct biological pathways by which cutaneous melanoma might develop; a nevus prone pathway initiated by early sun exposure and promoted by intermittent sun exposure or possibly host factors; and a chronic sun exposure pathway in sun sensitive people who progressively accumulate sun exposure to the sites of future melanomas.",

     "abstract": "Upper-tract urothelial cancer (UTUC), which includes renal pelvic cancer and ureter cancer, is a rare cancer and its prognosis is poor. Smoking and high-risk occupations (e.g., printing and dyestuff working which involves exposure to aniline dyes) are well-known risk factors for UTUC. However, the risk of alcohol consumption in UTUC remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether alcohol consumption is an independent risk factor for UTUC.The study was a case\u2013control study which used the nationwide clinical inpatient database of the Rosai Hospital group in Japan. We identified 1569 cases and 506,797 controls between 1984 and 2014. We estimated the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) of alcohol consumption for UTUC \u2013 never, up to 15\u00a0g/day, >15\u201330\u00a0g/day, or >30\u00a0g/day \u2013 using unconditional logistic regression. We adjusted for the following covariates: age, sex, study period, hospital, history of smoking, and high-risk occupation.The risk of UTUC was significantly higher in ever-drinkers compared with never-drinkers (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.23, 95%CI, 1.08\u20131.40; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Compared with never-drinkers, the risk threshold for UTUC was >15\u00a0g of alcohol consumption per day (equivalent to 6 ounces of Japanese sake containing 23\u00a0g of alcohol). A dose-response was observed (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Alcohol consumption may be an independent risk factor for UTUC, with a low-risk threshold of 15\u00a0g of alcohol per day.",

While gene expression-based prognostic assays may aid management of women with early estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors, therapeutic decision-making in women with early stage ER negative tumors remains fraught with difficulties. We investigated the association between adjuvant chemotherapy and overall survival in women with T1N0M0, hormone receptor negative breast cancers.All newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with node-negative and hormone receptor negative tumors measuring\u00a0\u2264\u00a02\u00a0cm at the University Malaya Medical Centre (Malaysia) from 1993 to 2013 were included. Mortality of patients with and without adjuvant chemotherapy were compared and adjusted for possible confounders using propensity score.Of 6732 breast cancer patients, 341 (5.1%) had small (\u22642\u00a0cm), node-negative and hormone receptor negative tumors at diagnosis. Among them, only 214 (62.8%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Five-year overall survival was 88.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 82.0%\u201394.2%) for patients receiving chemotherapy and 89.6% (95% CI: 85.1%\u201394.1%) for patients without chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was not associated with survival following adjustment for age, ethnicity, tumor size, tumor grade, HER2 status, lympho-vascular invasion, type of surgery and radiotherapy administration. However, chemotherapy was associated with a significant survival advantage (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.35, 95%CI: 0.14\u20130.91) in a subgroup of women with high-grade tumors.Adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to be associated with a survival benefit in women with T1N0M0, hormone receptor negative breast cancer except in those with high-grade tumors.",

However, evidence on the impact of major life events on mortality from breast cancer (BC) remains inconclusive. The main aim of this study is to investigate whether major negatively or positively experienced life events before or after diagnosis have an effect on BC-specific mortality in women who have survived with BC for at least 2 years.We conducted a case fatality study with data on life events from a self-administered survey and data on BC from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Cox models were fitted to estimate BC mortality hazard ratios (MRs) between those who have undergone major life events and those who haven\u2019t.None of the pre-diagnostic negative life events had any effect on BC-specific mortality. Regarding post-diagnostic events, the effect was greatest in women with moderate scores of events. As for event-specific scores, increased BC mortality was observed with spouse unemployment, relationship problems, and death of a close friend. By contrast, falling in love and positive developments in hobbies were shown to be associated with lower BC mortality (MRs 0.67, 95%CI: 0.49\u20130.92 and 0.74, 95%CI: 0.57\u20130.96, respectively). In an analysis restricted to recently diagnosed cases (2007), also death of a child and of a mother was associated with increased BC mortality.Some major life events regarding close personal relationships may play a role in BC-specific mortality, with certain negative life events increasing BC mortality and positive events decreasing it. The observed favorable associations between positive developments in romantic relationships and hobbies and BC mortality are likely to reflect the importance of social interaction and support.",

We analyzed the association between thyroid cancer and hormonal and reproductive factors among women enrolled in CATHY, a population-based case-control study conducted in France. The study included 430 cases of papillary thyroid cancer and 505 controls frequency-matched on age and area of residence. The odds ratios for thyroid cancer increased with age at menarche (p trend 0.05). Postmenopausal women were at increased risk, as compared to premenopausal women, particularly if menopause followed an ovariectomy, and for women with age at menopause <\u00a055\u00a0years. In addition, use of oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy reduced the association with thyroid cancer by about one third, and breastfeeding by 27%. Overall, these findings provide evidence that the risk of thyroid cancer increases with later age at menarche and after menopause, and decreases with use of oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy. These findings confirm an implication of hormonal factors in papillary thyroid cancer risk, whose mechanisms need to be elucidated.",

Past Canadian studies have not been able to thoroughly examine prostate cancer by occupation with detailed information on individual level factors.Occupation, industry and prostate cancer were examined using data from the National Enhanced Cancer Surveillance System, a large population-based case-control study conducted across eight Canadian provinces from 1994 to 1997. This analysis included 1737 incident cases and 1803 controls aged 50 to 79 years. Lifetime occupational histories were used to group individuals by occupation and industry employment. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and adjustments were made for known and possible risk factors.By occupation, elevated risks were observed in farming and farm management (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.37, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.84), armed forces (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95% CI 1.06-1.65) and legal work (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.58, 95% CI 1.05\u20136.35).

The association of socioeconomic and developmental characteristics were assessed using multinomial logit models.Four distinct comorbidity trajectories were identified. As many as 84% of cancer survivors remained at very low levels of comorbidity, and the distribution of trajectories was similar among the cancer survivors and the cancer-free men. Increases in comorbidity were seen among those who had comorbid disease at baseline and among those with poor summary disease scores in adolescence. Socioeconomic characteristics and physical, cognitive and psychological function were associated with types of trajectory in unadjusted models but did not retain independent relationships with them after simultaneous adjustment.Among working-age male cancer survivors, the majority remained free or had very low levels of comorbidity. Those with poorer health in adolescence and pre-existing comorbid diseases at cancer diagnosis may, however, benefit from follow-up to prevent further increases in comorbidity.",

Unfortunately, data on tumour stage are often missing for a non-negligible proportion of patients and the mechanism giving rise to the missingness is usually anything but completely at random. In this setting, restricting analysis to the subset of complete records gives typically biased results. Multiple imputation is a promising practical approach to the issues raised by the missing data, but its use in conjunction with the Pohar-Perme method for estimating net survival has not been formally evaluated.We performed a resampling study using colorectal cancer population-based registry data to evaluate the ability of multiple imputation, used along with the Pohar-Perme method, to deliver unbiased estimates of stage-specific net survival and recover missing stage information. We created 1000 independent data sets, each containing 5000 patients. Stage data were then made missing at random under two scenarios (30% and 50% missingness).Complete records analysis showed substantial bias and poor confidence interval coverage. Across both scenarios our multiple imputation strategy virtually eliminated the bias and greatly improved confidence interval coverage.In the presence of missing stage data complete records analysis often gives severely biased results. We showed that combining multiple imputation with the Pohar-Perme estimator provides a valid practical approach for the estimation of stage-specific colorectal cancer net survival. As usual, when the percentage of missing data is high the results should be interpreted cautiously and sensitivity analyses are recommended.",

Time-dependent Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for cancer-specific mortality and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) by post-diagnostic statin use (using a 6 month lag to reduce reverse causation) and to adjust these HRs for potential confounders.1921 esophageal cancer patients were included in the main analysis, of whom 651 (34%) used statins after diagnosis. There was little evidence of a reduction in esophageal cancer-specific mortality in statin users compared with non-users after diagnosis (adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a00.93, 95% CI, 0.81, 1.07) and no dose response associations were seen. However, statin users compared with non-users in the year before diagnosis had a weak reduction in esophageal cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a00.88, 95% CI, 0.79, 0.99).In this large population-based esophageal cancer cohort, there was little evidence of a reduction in esophageal cancer-specific mortality with statin use after diagnosis.",

This review synthesizes evidence from studies that have quantified the association between comorbidity and participation in breast and cervical screening.PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were systematically searched using key terms related to cancer screening and comorbidity for original research articles published between 1 January 1991 and 21 March 2016. Two reviewers independently screened 1283 studies that met eligibility criteria related to Population (adult, non-cancer populations), Exposure (comorbidity), Comparison (a \u2018no comorbidity\u2019 group), and Outcome (participation in breast cancer or cervical screening). Data was extracted and risk of bias assessed using a standardised tool from the 22 studies identified for inclusion (17 breast; 13 cervical). Meta-analyses were performed for participation in breast and cervical screening, stratified by important study characteristics.The majority of studies were conducted in the United States. Results of individual studies were variable. Most had medium to high risk of bias. Based on the three \u201clow risk of bias\u201d studies, mammography screening was less common among those with comorbidity (pooled Odds Ratio 0.66, 95%CI 0.44\u20130.88). The one \u201clow risk of bias\u201d study of cervical screening reported a negative association between comorbidity and participation.While a definitive conclusion could not be drawn, the results from high quality studies suggest that women with comorbidity are less likely to participate in breast, and possibly cervical, cancer screening.",

Baseline prevalence of cancers were assessed, incidence rates per 1000 person-years were calculated, and hazard ratios (HRs) adjusted for age, sex, socio-economic status, and healthcare consumption were estimated by Cox regression models.The study comprised a total of 49,475 patients with rosacea and 4,312,213 subjects from the general population.

We calculated age-standardized incidence and mortality rates (per 100,000) using direct method of standardization.The cancer incidence and mortality rates vary considerably between countries in the EMR. Incidence rates were highest in Lebanon (204 and 193 per 100,000 in males and females, respectively). Mortality rates were highest in Lebanon (119) and Egypt (121) among males and in Somalia (117) among females. The profile of common cancers differs substantially by sex. For females, breast cancer is the most common cancer in all 22 countries, followed by cervical cancer, which ranks high only in the lower-income countries in the region. For males, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer in combination represent almost 30% of the cancer burden in countries that have attained very high levels of human development.The most common cancers are largely amenable to preventive strategies by primary and/or secondary prevention, hence a need for effective interventions tackling lifestyle risk factors and infections. The high mortality observed from breast and cervical cancer highlights the need to break the stigmas and improve awareness surrounding these cancers.",

We used Cox proportional hazard models to determine associations between cancer subtypes and death rate, adjusted for variables of interest.Overall, 1275 cases were recorded with a mean age at diagnosis of 57(\u00b114) years. World standardized incidence and mortality were respectively 71.9/100,000 and 14.1/100,000 person-years.

Overall, 65.1% of patients were hormone receptor (HR)+ and 20.1% were HR-. Triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) accounted for 14% of all cases, and were more frequent in patients under 40 (21.6% vs. 13.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Five-year net survival was 84.9% [81.4-88.6]. It was higher for HR+/Her2+ and HR+/Her2- subtypes, and lower for HR-/Her2+ and TNBC patients.We found high age-specific incidence rates of breast cancer in women aged 45 to 55 years, which warrants further investigation in our population. However, this population of mainly African descent had good overall survival rates, and data according to subtypes are consistent with those reported internationally.

Association between Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML), Acute Lymphoid Leukaemia, Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia, Chronic Lymphoid Leukaemia, and use of coffee and tea was evaluated by standard logistic regression. Odds Ratios (OR) were estimated adjusting for the following potential confounders: gender, age, residence area, smoking habit, educational level, previous chemotherapy treatment, alcohol consumption and exposure to electromagnetic fields, radiation, pesticides and aromatic hydrocarbons.No association was observed between regular use of coffee and any type of leukaemia.

The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between ethnicity and deprivation in late (Stage IV) presentation of colorectal cancer.Data from the Thames Cancer Registry comprising 77,057 colorectal cancer patients between the years 2000 and 2012 were analysed.A total of 17,348 patients were identified with complete data, of which 53.9% were male. Patients from a Black Afro/Caribbean background were diagnosed with CRC at a much younger age than the White British group (median age 67 compared with 72, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In multiple regression, ethnicity, deprivation and age were positive predictors of presenting with advanced tumour stage at time of diagnosis. Black patients were more likely to present with Stage IV tumours than white patients (OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.18\u20131.59, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Social deprivation was also a predictor of Stage IV cancer presentation, with the most deprived group (Quintile 5) 1.26 times more likely to be diagnosed with Stage IV cancer compared with the most affluent group (CI 1.13\u20131.40, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

     "abstract": "Lymphohaematopoietic malignancies are common in the general population. There have been concerns that military service may be associated with increased risk as a result of occupational exposures. To date, few studies have demonstrated an increased risk, although a disability pension is payable to veterans who were present at nuclear tests and who develop leukaemia (other than chronic lymphocytic leukaemia). The aim of the study was to utilise data from the Scottish Veterans Health Study to examine the risk of lymphohaematopoietic malignancy following military service in a large national cohort of veterans.Retrospective cohort study of 57,000 veterans and 173,000 non-veterans born between 1945 and 1985 matched for age, sex and area of residence, adjusted for areal deprivation and followed up for up to 30 years, using Cox proportional hazard models to compare the risk of lymphohaematopoietic malignancy overall, by diagnosis and by sex and birth cohort.We found no statistically significant difference in risk between veterans and non-veterans either for all leukaemias (Cox proportional hazard ratio 1.03, 95% confidence intervals 0.84\u20131.27, p\u00a0=\u00a00.773), Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio 1.19, 95% confidence intervals 0.87\u20131.61, p\u00a0=\u00a00.272) or for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% confidence intervals 0.71\u20131.04, p\u00a0=\u00a00.110).Our findings provide reassurance that service in the UK Armed Forces is not associated with increased risk of lymphohaematopoietic malignancy.",

We assessed the effects of smoking, alcohol, and obesity prior to the diagnosis of KC on the development of SPCs, as these are well-established risk factors for multiple cancers and may also contribute to the increased risk of SPCs among those with KC. A total of 15,628 women with self-reported KC were identified in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study. Incident SPCs were assessed throughout the follow-up until June 2012. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of SPC associated with pre-diagnostic smoking, alcohol and body mass index (BMI). We also compared these risk estimates to those for first cancers in all cohort participants. During 193,695 person-years of follow-up, we recorded 2839 SPC cases. Compared with never smokers, current smokers had a significantly elevated risk for SPC overall and specifically for lung, colorectal, and bladder cancers. We also found a positive association between higher BMI and risk for SPC overall as well as for endometrial and bladder SPCs. Women with KC who consumed alcohol \u226530\u00a0g/day had a marginally higher risk of SPC compared to non-drinkers. The associations between incident SPC risk among KC cases and smoking, alcohol, and obesity appeared similar to the associations between these risk factors and the incident first primary cancers in the whole cohort. Only in the heavy smoking (\u226525 cigarettes/day) category was the HR for SPC after KC (2.34; 95% CI 1.98\u20132.76) slightly higher than that for the first cancer in the overall cohort (HR 1.86; 95% CI 1.75\u20131.98, Pheterogeneity\u00a0=\u00a00.01). In conclusion, pre-diagnostic smoking, alcohol and obesity prior to KC diagnosis were associated with risk of SPCs.",

     "abstract": "Oral cancer (OC) is a leading cause of death from cancer in men between the ages of 25 and 44 years in Taiwan. The overall 5-year survival rates for the four OC stages (I\u2013IV) in Taiwan are approximately 70%, 30%, 20%, and 10%, respectively, indicating the importance of the early diagnosis of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). Previous studies indicated an association between the OC incidence and certain environmental heavy metal concentrations. If these associations do exist for OC, they may also be observed for OPMD. The purpose of this study is to explore the association between the development of OPMD to OC and environmental heavy metals. Oral submucous fibrosis (OSF) and oral leukoplakia (OL) are two major types of OPMD in Taiwan.A retrospective cohort study was conducted by Changhua Christian Hospital, the sole medical center in Changhua County, where 2725 male adult patients diagnosed with either OSF or OL between 2000 and 2014 were recruited. Data were analyzed by Cox regression and adjusted for smoking and betel-quid chewing.OPMD patients who resided in areas with high nickel concentrations (polluted levels) exhibited hazard ratios of 1.8\u20132 for OC relative to those who lived in areas with low nickel levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Meanwhile, smokers with OPMDs had a hazard ratio of 2.8\u20132.9 relative to non-smokers. Betel-quid chewers had a 2.2\u20132.3 hazard ratio relative to non-chewers. Smoking, betel-quid chewing, and environmental nickel exposure are associated with an increased risk of OC development in OPMD patients. This study provides valuable findings on the environmental effects of heavy metals on human health. Enhanced surveillance of the condition of OPMD patients who have been exposed to high nickel concentrations may be crucial for OC prevention.",

We recently reported the screening with tomosynthesis or standard mammography-2 (STORM-2) trial, showing that double-read tomosynthesis (pseudo-3D-mammography) detected more BC than double-read 2D-mammography. In this study, we compare screen-detection measures for single-reading of 3D-mammography with those for double-reading of 2D-mammography, to inform screening practice.This is a secondary analysis based on STORM-2 which prospectively compared 3D-mammography and 2D-mammography in sequential screen-readings. Asymptomatic women \u226549 years who attended population-based screening (Trento, 2013\u20132015) were recruited. Participants recalled at any screen-read from parallel double-reading arms underwent further testing and/or biopsy. Single-reading of 3D-mammography, integrated with acquired or synthetized 2D-mammograms, was compared to double-reading of 2D-mammograhy alone for screen-detection measures: number of detected BCs, cancer detection rate (CDR), number and percentage of false-positive recall (FPR). Paired binary data were compared using McNemar\u2019s test.Screening detected 90, including 74 invasive, BCs in 85 of 9672 participants.

     "abstract": "Survival rates from colorectal cancer (CRC) are highly variable in Europe. This variability could potentially be explained by differences in healthcare system delays in diagnosis. However, even when such delays are reduced, the relationship of the diagnostic interval (time from presentation with symptoms to diagnosis) with outcome is uncertain.A total of 795 patients with CRC from 5 regions of Spain were retrospectively examined in this population-based multicenter study. Consecutive incident cases of CRC were identified from pathology services. The total diagnostic interval (TDI) was defined as the time from the first presentation with symptoms to diagnosis based on 3 different sources of information: (i) patient-recorded data (PR-TDI) by interview, (ii) hospital-recorded data (HR-TDI), and (iii) general practitioner-recorded data (GPR-TDI). Concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs) were used to estimate the agreement of 3 different TDIs. The TDIs of patients with different stages of CRC were also compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test.The median TDI was 131\u00a0days based on patient interview data, 91\u00a0days based on HR data, and 111\u00a0days based on GPR data. Overall, the agreement of these TDIs was poor (CCCPRvsHR\u00a0=\u00a00.399, CCCPRvsGPR\u00a0=\u00a00.518, CCCHRvsGPR\u00a0=\u00a00.383). Univariate analysis indicated that the TDI was greater in those with less advanced CRC for all 3 methods of calculation, but this association was only statistically significant for the HR-TDI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021).There is no evidence that patients with more advanced CRC have longer TDIs. In fact, we found an inverse relationship between the TDI and CRC stage, an example of the \u201cwaiting time paradox\u201d. This association may likely be due to the presence of unmeasured confounders as the stage when symptoms appear or the tumour aggressiveness.",

Multivariable logistic regression was used to characterize patients reported by multiple vs. single institutions.Overall in this region, 17% of cancers were reported by multiple institutions. Of the 33% reported by an IHS, 8% were also reported by a non-IHS. Of non-IHS patients, 21% were reported by multiple institutions, with 28% for breast and 27% for pancreatic cancer, but 19%% for lung and 18% for prostate cancer. Generally, patients more likely to be seen by multiple institutions were younger or had more severe disease at diagnosis.Population-based data show that one in six newly diagnosed cancer patients received care from multiple institutions, and differed from patients seen only at a single institution. Cancer care data from single institutions may be incomplete and possibly biased.",

He we report on the first population-based, epidemiological analysis of patients diagnosed with MDS in Switzerland between 2001 and 2012. The aim of this study was to characterize the extent and limitations of currently available population-based, epidemiological data and formulate recommendations for future health services research. The investigated outcomes comprised trends of annual case frequency, classification of morphological subtypes, incidence, mortality and survival. Annual case frequency increased by 20% (from 263 to 315 cases per year), whereas age-standardized incidence-/mortality-rates remained stable (2.5/1.1 per 100\u2032000 person-years). This observation reflects population growth as well as higher diagnostic awareness and not an increase of age-specific risk. However, it will inevitably influence the future prevalence of MDS and the impact on healthcare systems. Reporting of classification in MDS subtypes was poor with modest improvement from 20% to 39% and increased awareness for mainly higher-risk diseases. Relative survival for all patients at 5-years (RS) ranged between 37 and 40%. Significant better RS was found for younger compared to older higher-risk MDS patients (48% vs. 17%), reflecting the effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. However, no survival advantage was found in elderly patients after introduction of hypomethylating agents as standard for care in this patient group. Our data is in line with results from other MDS and cancer registries. It allows formulating recommendations for future collaborative health services research on MDS patients with national and international partners.",

The ERSPC has shown a significant 21% reduction in PrCa mortality at 13 years of follow-up. The effect of screening appears to vary across centres, for which several explanations are possible. We set to assess if the apparent differences in PrCa mortality reduction between the centres can be explained by differences in screening protocols.We examined the centre differences by developing a simulation model and estimated how alternative screening protocols would have affected PrCa mortality.Our results showed outcomes similar to those observed, when the results by centres were reproduced by simulating the screening regimens with PSA threshold of 3 versus 4\u00a0ng/ml, or screening interval of two versus four years. The findings suggest that the differences are only marginally attributable to the different screening protocols.The small screening impact in Finland was not explained by the differences in the screening protocols.

     "abstract": "This paper aims to determine whether racial disparities exist in hospitalization outcomes among African-American and White hospitalized prostate cancer patients in the United States. We evaluated racial differences among matched groups of patients in post-operative complications, hospital length of stay and in-hospital mortality.We identified a total of 183,856 men aged 40 years and older with a primary diagnosis of prostate cancer, of which 58,701 underwent prostatectomy, through the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, and matched all African-American patients with White patients on: 1) Demographics, 2) Demographics\u00a0+\u00a0Clinical presentation and 3) Demographics\u00a0+\u00a0Clinical presentation\u00a0+\u00a0Treatment. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted in SAS and estimates were reported with 95% confidence intervals.African-American patients were more likely to be admitted with metastatic disease (24.8%) compared with White patients matched on demographics (17.9%), and demographics\u00a0+\u00a0presentation (23.6%). However, 23.9% of African-American patients received surgery compared with 38.2% and 34.2% of Whites matched on demographics and demographics\u00a0+\u00a0presentation, respectively. White patients had lower in-hospital mortality compared with African-American patients matched on demographics (OR: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.66-0.79), demographics\u00a0+\u00a0presentation (OR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96), but was no longer significantly lower when matched on demographics, presentation and treatment (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85\u20131.00).There were significant racial differences in outcomes among prostate cancer patients within the inpatient setting, even after accounting for demographic and presentation differences.",

Here, we revisit the feasibility and comparability of using alternative sources of controls, specifically friend and family controls.We recruited from a recently completed case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among women in Los Angeles County where controls from the parent study were ascertained by neighborhood walk. We calculated participation rates and compared questionnaire responses between the friend/family controls and the original matched controls from the parent study.Of the 182 NHL case patients contacted, 111 (61%) agreed to participate in our feasibility study. 70 (63%) provided contact information for potential friend and/or family member controls. We were able to successfully contact and recruit a friend/family member for 92% of the case patients. This represented 46 friend controls and 54 family controls. Family controls significantly differed from original matched controls by sex and household income. Other characteristics were similar between friend controls and the original study\u2019s neighborhood controls.The apparent comparability of neighborhood controls to friend and family controls among respondents in this study suggests that these alternative methods of control identification can serve as a complementary source of eligible controls in epidemiologic case-control studies.",

     "abstract": "Relative survival ratios (RSRs) can be useful for evaluating the impact of changes in cancer care on the prognosis of cancer patients or for comparing the prognosis for different subgroups of patients, but their use is problematic for cancer sites where screening has been introduced due to the potential of lead-time bias. Lead-time is survival time that is added to a patient's survival time because of an earlier diagnosis irrespective of a possibly postponed time of death. In the presence of screening it is difficult to disentangle how much of an observed improvement in survival is real and how much is due to lead-time bias. Even so, RSRs are often presented for breast cancer, a site where screening has led to early diagnosis, with the assumption that the lead-time bias is small. We describe a simulation-based framework for studying the lead-time bias due to mammography screening on RSRs of breast cancer based on a natural history model developed in a Swedish setting. We have performed simulations, using this framework, under different assumptions for screening sensitivity and breast cancer survival with the aim of estimating the lead-time bias. Screening every second year among ages 40\u201375 was introduced assuming that screening had no effect on survival, except for lead-time bias. Relative survival was estimated both with and without screening to enable quantification of the lead-time bias. Scenarios with low, moderate and high breast cancer survival, and low, moderate and high screening sensitivity were simulated, and the lead-time bias assessed in all scenarios.",

We used the most recent, high quality data from 6 cancer registries for two 5-year periods, 1998\u20132002 and 2003\u20132007, from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents to estimate colorectal cancer incidence by subsite in 5 Asian countries. Cases with overlapping lesions or otherwise unspecified colon cancer were re-distributed as proximal or distal colon cancer. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) per 100,000 population and incidence rate ratios from 1998 to 2002 to 2003\u20132007 were calculated for each subsite. For 2003\u20132007, men in Miyagi, Japan, had the highest ASR for cancer in the proximal colon, distal colon and rectum. Men of Jewish ancestry in Israel had a high ASR for proximal and distal colon cancer, but the lowest ASR for rectal cancer. The proportion of rectal cancer was highest among Korean men (51.39%) and lowest among Israeli women (26.6%). From 1998\u20132002 to 2003\u20132007, rectal cancer incidence did not significantly change in most registries, except for men in Miyagi, Japan, and both sexes in Korea. However, during the same period cancer incidence in the proximal and distal colon increased in most registries. In conclusion, there was substantial variation in subsite distributions of colorectal cancer in Asian registries and increases in overall incidence of colorectal cancer could be attributed to increases in colon cancer.",

Manitoba, Canada has an accurate cancer registry, a drug information program network and a breast screening program since 1995.

Identifiable co-morbidities, prescribed endocrine therapy, staging, surgery, treatment and overall and disease-free survival by intrinsic sub-type were evaluated.Prevalence of Luminal A (41.7%), Luminal B HER2- (15.6%), Luminal B HER2+ (8.9%), Basal-like(10.8%), and HER2+ non-luminal (5.1%) were consistent with other descriptive studies in Canada and Spain.

     "abstract": "HPV attributable cancers are the second most common infection-related cancers worldwide, with much higher burden in less developed regions. There are currently no country-specific estimates of the burden of these cancers in Nigeria just like many other low and middle income countries.In this study, we quantified the proportion of the cancer burden in Nigeria that is attributable to HPV infection from 2012 to 2014 using HPV prevalence estimated from previous studies and data from two population based cancer registries (PBCR) in Nigeria. We considered cancer sites for which there is strong evidence of an association with HPV infection based on the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classification. We obtained age and sex-specific estimates of incident cancers and using the World Standard Population, we derived age standardized incidence (ASR) rates for each cancer type by categories of sex, and estimated the population attributable fractions (PAF).The two PBCR reported 4336 new cancer cases from 2012 to 2014. Of these, 1627 (37.5%) were in males and 2709 (62.5%) in females. Some 11% (488/4336) of these cancers were HPV associated; 2% (38/1627) in men and 17% (450/2709) in women. Of the HPV associated cancers, 7.8% occurred in men and 92.2% in women. The ASRs for HPV associated cancers was 33.5 per 100,000; 2.3 and 31.2 per 100,000 in men and women respectively. The proportion of all cancers attributable to HPV infection ranged from 10.2 to 10.4% (442\u2013453 of 4336) while the proportion of HPV associated cancers attributable to HPV infection ranged from 90.6% to 92.8% (442\u2013453 of the 488 cases). In men, 55.3% to 68.4% of HPV associated cancers were attributable to HPV infection compared to 93.6% to 94.8% in women. The combined ASR for HPV attributable cancers ranged from 31.0 to 31.7 per 100,000. This was 1.4 to 1.7 per 100,000 in men and 29.6 to 30.0 per 100,000 in women. In women, cervical cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0392, ASR 28.3 per 100,000) was the commonest HPV attributable cancer, while anal cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a021, ASR 1.2 per 100,000) was the commonest in men.HPV attributable cancers constitute a substantial cancer burden in Nigerian women, much less so in men. A significant proportion of cancers in Nigerian women would be prevented if strategies such as HPV DNA based screening and HPV vaccination are implemented.",

This study estimates disparities in breast cancer among younger compared with older women by race/ethnicity using five measures of population health: life expectancy (LE), expected years of life lost (EYLL), cumulative incidence rate (CIR), and incidence and mortality rate ratios (IRR and MRR).Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, LE and EYLL were estimated from a cohort of 15\u201344 and 45\u201364 years, non-Hispanic black (NHB), non-Hispanic white (NHW), and Hispanic women diagnosed with breast cancer, 2000\u20132013. Survival function was obtained from the study years and then extrapolated to lifetime using the Monte Carlo method. The CIR, IRR and MRR were calculated using 2009\u20132013 breast cancer incidence and mortality rates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s National Program of Cancer Registries.The estimated LE ranged from 32.12 to 7.42 years for localized to distant stages among younger NHB women compared to 33.05 to 9.95 years for younger NHW women. The estimated EYLL was 12.78 years for younger women, and 4.99 for older women. By race/ethnicity, it was 15.53 years for NHB, 14.23 years for Hispanic and 11.87 years for NHW (P\u00a0<\u00a00.00025). The CIR for age-group 15\u201344 years (CIR15-44) indicated a 1 in 86 probability for NHB compared to a 1 in 87 probability for NHW being diagnosed with breast cancer by age 45. The estimated age-adjusted incidence rate for NHB-to-NHW women was IRR\u00a0=\u00a01.10 (95%, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.08\u20131.11) and the corresponding mortality rate was MRR\u00a0=\u00a02.02 (95%, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.94\u20132.11).The breast cancer disparities between younger NHB compared to NHW women highlight the need for expanded efforts to address these disparities through primary prevention and to improve access to quality healthcare to minority women with breast cancer.",

Numerator data were abstracted from national death files where the cause was malignant neoplasm of the breast (ICD-10\u00a0=\u00a0C50) for women. Population-based denominators were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau for 2010\u20132014. To measure the racial disparity, we calculated Black:White rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals for each 5-year period. To determine whether changes over time in the disparity were statistically significant, we calculated a 2-sided z score for the change in the relative percent difference between the Black and White rates for 2005\u20132009 and 2010\u20132014.At the most recent time point (2010\u20132014), the RR was significantly greater than 1.00 in the US and 24 cities. The change in the Black:White disparity was statistically significant in five cities and the US. The percent difference increased significantly in Atlanta, GA (from 4.1 to 117.4, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); San Antonio, TX (from 24.4 to 79.3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034); and the US (from 39.7 to 43.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007).

     "abstract": "Alcohol intake may increase the risk of prostate cancer (PCa). Many previous studies harbored important methodological limitations.We conducted a population-based case-control study of PCa comprising 1933 cases and 1994 controls in Montreal, Canada. Lifetime alcohol consumption was elicited, by type of beverage, during in-person interviews. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) assessed the association between alcohol intake and PCa risk, adjusting for potential confounders and considering the subjects\u2019 PCa screening history.We observed a weak, non-significant positive association between high consumption of total alcohol over the lifetime and risk of high-grade PCa (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.18, 95% CI 0.81\u20131.73). Risk estimates were more pronounced among current drinkers (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.40, 95%CI 1.00\u20131.97), particularly after adjusting for the timing of last PCa screening (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.52, 95%CI 1.07\u20132.16). These associations were largely driven by beer consumption. The OR for high-grade PCa associated with high beer intake was 1.37 (95%CI 1.00\u20131.89); it was 1.49 (95%CI 0.99\u20132.23) among current drinkers and 1.68 (95% CI 1.10\u20132.57) after adjusting for screening recency. High cumulative consumption of spirits was associated with a lower risk of low-grade PCa (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.75, 95%CI 0.60\u20130.94) but the risk estimate no longer achieved statistical significance when restricting to current users. No association was found for wine consumption.Findings add to the accumulating evidence that high alcohol consumption increases the risk of high-grade PCa. This association largely reflected beer intake in our population, and was strengthened when taking into account PCa screening history.",

     "abstract": "Patient race has been shown to predict for differences in outcomes and has been attributed to socioeconomic factors such as social support and access to healthcare. In head and neck cancer (HNC), a disease without recommended screening, we sought to investigate the association between race, treatment delays and outcome.Records of 1802 patients with non-metastatic squamous cell HNC treated between 1998 and 2013 were retrospectively assessed from an institutional database. Patient demographics, tumor and treatment characteristics, and patient outcomes were abstracted from the chart. Differences between groups were assessed via logistic regression multivariate analysis (MVA). Outcomes including locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS) were then estimated via Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression MVA.Median follow up was 34 months. Patient races included white (n\u00a0=\u00a01671, 93%), black (n\u00a0=\u00a080, 4%), Asian (n\u00a0=\u00a018, 1%), and other (n\u00a0=\u00a033, 2%). On logistic regression MVA, Black patients were less likely to be married (39% vs. 63%; OR 0.5 95%CI 0.30\u20130.83, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) or be currently employed (43% vs. 61%; OR 0.44 95%CI 0.26\u20130.74, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) when compared to non-blacks. Black patients were also younger (54 vs. 59 years, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), more likely to present with advanced tumor stage (T4: 48% vs. 25%), and more often had >45\u00a0days elapsed from diagnosis to treatment initiation (DTI) (61% vs. 49%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028). Delays in treatment, such as delayed diagnosis (advanced disease presentation) and delays in DTI\u00a0>\u00a045\u00a0days were also associated with marital and employment status.Black patients were associated with a lower 3-year LRC rate (65% vs. 81%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and OS rate (43% vs. 69%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), compared to non-black patients. Patients with >45\u00a0days DTI had a detriment in 3-year LRC (77% vs. 83%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and OS (66% vs. 69%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). On Cox MVA, black race was independently prognostic for worse LRC (HR 1.62 95%CI 1.04\u20132.51, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033) and OS (HR 1.55 95%CI 1.15\u20132.08, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) vs. non-blacks.Black race is independently prognostic for LRC and OS. Delays in HNC treatment, such as more advanced tumor stage presentation and delays in treatment initiation, may be attributed to socioeconomic factors such as employment status and social support. Efforts to accommodate these factors may expedite treatment, in hopes of improving the race related outcome disparity in HNC.",

We evaluated whether genetic variations in microRNA coding regions, binding sites, or biogenesis genes (collectively referred to as miRNA-SNPs) were associated with risk of AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma (AIDS-NHL), and serum levels of four lymphoma-related microRNAs.Twenty-five miRNA-SNPs were genotyped in 180 AIDS-NHL cases and 529 HIV-infected matched controls from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS), and real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify serum microRNA levels. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) estimated using conditional logistic regression evaluated associations between miRNA-SNPs and AIDS-NHL risk. A semi-Bayes shrinkage approach was employed to reduce likelihood of false-positive associations. Adjusted mean ratios (MR) calculated using linear regression assessed associations between miRNA-SNPs and serum microRNA levels.DDX20 rs197412, a non-synonymous miRNA biogenesis gene SNP, was associated with AIDS-NHL risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.34 per minor allele; 95% CI: 1.02\u20131.75), and higher miRNA-222 serum levels nearing statistical significance (MR\u00a0=\u00a01.21 per minor allele; 95% CI: 0.98\u20131.49).

The minor allele of HIF1A rs2057482, which creates a miRNA-196a2 binding site, was associated with systemic AIDS-NHL risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.73 per minor allele; 95% CI: 1.12\u20132.67), and decreased CNS AIDS-NHL risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.49 per minor allele; 95% CI: 0.25\u20130.94).This study suggests that a few miRNA-SNPs are associated with AIDS-NHL risk and may modulate miRNA expression. These results support a role for miRNA in AIDS-NHL and may highlight pathways to be targeted for risk stratification or therapeutics.",

Secondary data were acquired from January 2002 to December 2013. Kaplan\u2013Meier and Cox regression methods were used for survival analysis. Logistical analysis tested the association between early death (lower tertile between diagnosis and death, according to cancer type) and clinical or sociodemographic variables.We included a total of 889 cases with an average age of 23, with similar gender distributions and a predominance of Caucasian ethnicity. Using the Cox framework of proportional risks adjusted for neoplasia types and gender, individuals with non-hematological neoplasia (solid tumors) presented a 47% higher risk of dying when compared with individuals diagnosed with leukemias and lymphomas (HR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.12\u20131.93). Chances of death were 31% higher for males than for females (HR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.02\u20131.69). When adjusting for type of neoplasia and age (15\u201324 and 25\u201329) the risk of death by cancer was 51% greater in individuals diagnosed with non-hematological neoplasia when compared with individuals diagnosed with leukemias and lymphomas (HR: 1.51; 95%CI: 1.15\u20131.99). The chance of death by cancer in patients under the age of 25 was 33% greater when compared to that in older patients between the ages of 25 and 29 (HR: 1.33; 95%CI: 1.04\u20131.75). In multiple regression analysis, factors associated with early mortality from cancer were the number of years in school (P\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and time between diagnosis and start of treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).The sample studied with a longer period of time between diagnosis and the start of treatment (access to oncology therapy) and with fewer years in school showed that these factors had important roles in early death from cancer for the observed individuals. This must be considered when planning and identifying risk in young cancer patients in order to lower the impact of the disease on mortality for this age group.",

This cohort was linked to the Prescribing Information System and the National Records of Scotland Death Records (until January 2015) to identify 1064 colorectal cancer-specific deaths. Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer-specific mortality by statin use were calculated using time dependent Cox regression models. The systematic review included relevant studies published before January 2016. Meta-analysis techniques were used to derive combined HRs for associations between statin use and cancer-specific and overall mortality.In the Scottish cohort, statin use before diagnosis (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.84, 95% CI 0.75\u20130.94), but not after (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.90, 95% CI 0.77\u20131.05), was associated with significantly improved cancer-specific mortality.

     "abstract": "Smoking is known to influence messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) cases. As microRNAs (miRNAs) are known repressors of mRNAs, we hypothesize that smoking may influence miRNA expression, thus altering mRNA expression. Our sample consisted of 1447 CRC cases that had normal colorectal mucosa and carcinoma miRNA data and lifestyle data. We examined current smoking, current versus never and former versus never (C/F/N) smoking1, and pack-years smoked with miRNA expression in normal mucosa as well as differential miRNA expression between paired normal and carcinoma tissue for colon and rectal tissue to determine associations between smoking and miRNA expression. We adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR).Significant associations were seen for rectal differential miRNA expression only. We analyzed miRNAs significantly associated with smoking with CIMP and MSI status, using a polytomous logistic regression. Two hundred and thirty-one miRNAs were differentially expressed with current smoking, 172 with C/F/N, and 206 with pack-years smoked; 111 were associated with all three. Forty-three miRNAs were unique to current smoking, 14 were unique to C/F/N and 57 were unique to pack years smoked. Of the 306 unique miRNAs associated with cigarette smoking, 41 were inversely associated and 200 were directly associated with CIMP high or MSI tumor molecular phenotype for either colon or rectal cancer. Our results suggest that cigarette smoking can alter miRNA expression and, given associations with CIMP high and MSI tumor molecular phenotype, it is possible that smoking influences tumor phenotype through altered miRNA expression.",

After restricting to cases of epithelial invasive cancers and controls aged 40\u201379 years who completed an interview that included coffee, soft drink, and tea consumption (ascertained starting in 2005 in British Columbia and 2008 in Alberta), there were a total of 524 cases and 1587 controls.

Adult lifetime cumulative consumption (cup-years\u00a0=\u00a0cups/day\u00a0*\u00a0years) was calculated. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to describe the association between the relevant drink consumption and risk.No excess risk was seen for coffee or caffeinated soft drinks. Similarly, any tea consumption was not associated with risk, but when stratified by the type of tea, there was an increase in risk in black tea only drinkers (aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.56; 95% CI:1.07\u20132.28 for >40 cup-years), but no excess risk for the exclusive green tea drinkers.

Altogether 14 PCa deaths were estimated as false-positive in both arms and exclusion of these resulted in HR 0.92 (95% CI 0.80\u20131.06).A small differential misclassification bias in ascertainment of CoD was present, most likely due to attribution bias (overdiagnosis in the SA).

Results from thematic analysis of focus group discussions with health care providers and UNS community members were used to develop an on-line, province-wide, cross-sectional survey to estimate the prevalence of barriers and facilitators for the provincial population. Adjusted prevalence odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were estimated for UNS compared to regularly screened participants using logistic regression.Four focus groups were held with health service providers and sixteen with UNS community members. Top barriers and facilitators themed around provider-patient communication, fear and embarrassment, history of physical or sexual abuse, social determinants of health (including low literacy, lack of awareness, and health insurance), symptoms appearing, and family and friends. 3075 participants completed the online survey. Compared to regularly screened participants, UNS had significantly higher odds of reporting: no regular health care provider; not feeling comfortable talking about screening; or the Doctor or Nurse Practitioner not suggesting screening. UNS also had significantly higher odds of reporting the facilitators: the test being less scary/painful or uncomfortable; friend/family insisting on getting screened; starting to have symptoms; or an easier test that could be done at home.Interventions addressing fear through individual, interpersonal and structural facilitators may increase cancer screening.",

Women aged 20\u201339 were compared to those aged 40\u201349 years. Poisson regression with robust error variance was used to explore the impact of age on treatment receipt. Associations between age and survival from all causes was investigated using Cox models. In multivariate models, women aged 20\u201339 significantly more often having no cancer-directed surgery (IRR\u00a0=\u00a01.49, 95%CI 1.07, 2.08). In those having surgery, younger age was associated with significantly higher likelihood of receiving chemotherapy; age was not associated with receipt of adjuvant radiotherapy or endocrine therapy. Women aged 20\u201339 undergoing surgery were significantly more likely to die than women aged 40\u201349 (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.84, 95%CI: 1.31, 2.59). Age is an independent prognostic factor in younger women diagnosed with HR+/Her2- breast cancer, supporting the hypothesis that breast cancer in women under 40 has more aggressive behaviour, even within HR+/Her2- tumours. Future research should explore the reasons for poorer survival in order to inform strategies to improve outcomes in this age group.",

Potential methods: for cancer case ascertainment include active follow-up and passive linkage with state cancer registries. Here we compare the two approaches in a large cancer screening trial.The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial enrolled 154,955 subjects at ten U.S. centers and followed them for all-cancer incidence. Cancers were ascertained by an active follow-up process involving annual questionnaires, retrieval of records and medical record abstracting to ascertain and confirm cancers. For a subset of centers, linkage with state cancer registries was also performed. We assessed the agreement of the two methods in ascertaining incident cancers from 1993 to 2009 in 80,083 subjects from six PLCO centers where cancers were ascertained both by active follow-up and through linkages with 14 state registries.The ratio (times 100) of confirmed cases ascertained by registry linkage compared to active follow-up was 96.4 (95% CI: 95.1\u201398.2). Of cancers ascertained by either method, 86.6% and 83.5% were identified by active follow-up and by registry linkage, respectively. Of cancers missed by active follow-up, 30% were after subjects were lost to follow-up and 16% were reported but could not be confirmed. Of cancers missed by the registries, 27% were not sent to the state registry of the subject\u2019s current address at the time of linkage.Linkage with state registries identified a similar number of cancers as active follow-up and can be a cost-effective method to ascertain incident cancers in a large cohort.",

A wide range of factors was associated with a higher likelihood of PSA testing including age, height, education level, family history of prostate cancer, black ethnic origin, not being in paid/self-employment, living with a wife or partner, having had a vasectomy, being diagnosed with cancer or hypertension and having a high dietary intake of cereal, cooked and salad/raw vegetables, fresh fruit and tea. Conversely, socioeconomic deprivation, Asian ethnic origin, current smoking, low alcohol intake, high body-mass index, high coffee consumption and being diagnosed with diabetes, heart disease or stroke were associated with a lower likelihood of PSA testing.A variety of sociodemographic, lifestyle and health-related characteristics are associated with PSA testing, suggesting that observed associations of some of these traits with risk for prostate cancer in epidemiological studies may be, at least partially, due to detection bias.",

We verified that registries were able to provide accurate estimation of labor costs, which is the largest expenditure incurred by registries. We also identified several factors that can influence the cost of registry operations, including size of the geographic area served, data collection approach, local cost of living, presence of rural areas, volume of cases, extent of consolidation of records to cases, and continuity of funding.Internal and external registry factors reveal that a single estimate for the cost of registry operations is not feasible; costs will vary on the basis of factors that may be beyond the control of the registries. Some factors, such as data collection approach, can be modified to improve the efficiency of registry operations. These findings will inform both future economic data collection using a web-based tool and cost and cost-effectiveness analyses of registry operations in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and other locations with similar characteristics.",

The registries provided cost data for the year 2013 and cancer cases corresponding to the year 2010.We identified an almost threefold variation in the average cost per case (77,932 to 214,082 Colombian pesos or US $41 to US $113 in 2013) across the registries, but there were also substantial differences in data collection approaches, types of data collected, and activities performed. Cost per inhabitant varied between 95 and 415 Colombian pesos (US $0.05 to US $0.22). Between 20% and 45% of the total cost was due to fixed cost activities.The detailed economic information presented in this study constitutes a valuable source of activity-based cost data that registries can use to compare operations, assess key factors that lead to differences in cost per case, and identify potential approaches to improve efficiencies. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from studying the Colombian registries can help inform the planning and operations of other registries in the region.",

Evidence will help registries to quantify and advocate for the funds needed to sustain, enhance, and expand high quality cancer registration in Kenya.In this study, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC\u2019s) International Registry Costing Tool (IntRegCosting Tool) to evaluate the funding, cost, and labor resources used to perform the cancer registry operations in Nairobi County for two annual periods between July 2012 and June 2014.Funding from grants, research studies, and international organizations provided 70% of the registry operations\u2019 cost. For both time periods, the most-costly registry activities were related to administration, management, and training, along with data acquisition activities such as data abstraction, entry, and validation. Even among these core registry activities, however, substantial variations existed.Stable funding for cancer registry operations is necessary to sustain core registry activities in other to deliver high-quality data, which in turn is necessary to foster evidence-based policies to improve cancer outcomes.

We grouped the registry activities into fixed cost, variable core cost, and variable other cost activities. After a comparison KCR and GCR characteristics, we used the cost of the KCR to project the likely ongoing costs for the new GCR.The KCR incurred 42% of its expenditures in fixed cost activities, 40% for variable core cost activities, and the remaining 18% for variable other cost activities. The total cost per case registered was 28,201 Ugandan shillings (approximately US $10 in 2014) to collect and report cases using a combination of passive and active cancer data collection approaches. The GCR performs only active data collection, and covers a much larger area, but serves a smaller population compared to the KCR.After identifying many differences between KCR and GCR that could potentially affect the cost of registration, our best estimate is that the GCR, though newer and in a rural area, should require fewer resources than the KCR to sustain operations as a stand-alone entity. The optimal structure of the GCR needs to be determined in the future.",

We used cancer and CVD cost data for the annual period April 2014 through March 2015 to estimate the total cost and cost per case. We used prospectively collected average annual CVD cases, and for cancer cases we assumed 2 or 3 years are needed for retrospective data collection.The Ministry of Health provided 56% of the resources for the registries. Labor accounted for over 70% of both registries\u2019 budgets, while management and administration, along with data collection and analysis, incurred the highest costs per case. Total variable cost activities related to data collection and analysis were higher for the CVD component (US$131,297) than the cancer component (US$58,917). The CVD cost per case (US$489) was in between the cancer 2-year (US$382) and the cancer 3-year (US$573) cost-per-case estimates.These findings indicate that there are substantial fixed costs related to management and administration of NCD registries. All registries need management and administration support. When registries are combined, management and administration costs can be shared. We project that registries that can share fixed-cost infrastructure are likely to incur a lower total cost per case.",

Data collectors at the satellites perform data abstraction, but Mumbai carries out all other core registration activities such as data analysis and quality assurance. Each of the three satellite registries follows the same data collection methodology as the main Mumbai Cancer Registry. This study examines the cost of operating the Mumbai and its satellite cancer registries.We modified and used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC\u2019s) International Registry Costing Tool (IntRegCosting Tool) to collect cost and resource use data for the Mumbai Cancer Registry and three satellites.Almost 60% of the registration expenditure was borne by the Indian Cancer Society, which hosts the Mumbai Cancer Registry, and more than half of the registry expenditure was related to data collection activities. Across the combined registries, 93% of the expenditure was spent on labor. Overall, registration activities had a low cost per case of 226.10 Indian rupees (or a little less than 4.00 US dollars in 2014 [used average exchange rate in 2014: 1 US $\u00a0=\u00a060 Indian rupees]).The centralization of fixed-cost activities in Mumbai likely resulted in economies of scale in operating the Mumbai and satellite registries, which, together, report on almost 20,000 cancer cases annually. In middle-income countries like India, where financial resources are limited, the operational framework provided by the Mumbai and satellite registries can serve as a model for other registries looking to expand data collection.",

Cancer registration involves substantial fixed cost and labor. Labor accounts for more than 50% of all expenditures across all registries. The cost per cancer case registered in low-income and lower-middle-income countries ranged from US $3.77 to US $15.62 (United States dollars). In Colombia, an upper to middle-income country, the cost per case registered ranged from US $41.28 to US $113.39. Registries serving large populations (over 15 million inhabitants) had a lower cost per inhabitant (less than US $0.01 in Mumbai, India) than registries serving small populations (under 500,000 inhabitants) [US $0.22] in Pasto, Colombia.This study estimates the total cost and resources used for cancer registration across several countries in the limited-resource setting, and provides cancer registration stakeholders and registries with opportunities to identify cost savings and efficiency improvements. Our results suggest that cancer registration involve substantial fixed costs and labor, and that partnership with other institutions is critical for the operation and sustainability of cancer registries in limited resource settings. Although we included registries from a variety of limited-resource areas, information from eight registries in four countries may not be large enough to capture all the potential differences among the registries in limited-resource settings.",

A large proportion of cancer cases and deaths could be prevented through the implementation of cancer screening programmes. However, there are social inequalities in patient access to these programmes, especially in underserved communities and minority populations.To identify, characterise and analyse the effectiveness of patient-targeted healthcare interventions to promote cancer screening programmes in ethnic minorities.A comprehensive search of bibliographic databases was conducted. The results of our systematic review were reported in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines.Seventeen articles were identified and included in the review. Sixteen of the seventeen studies were conducted in the United States and one was conducted in Israel. Fifteen of the seventeen interventions selected were effective in increasing cancer screening rates. Moreover, five of the seventeen studies found an improvement in cancer knowledge, awareness, self-efficacy, attitudes, intention and perceptions, and three studies found a positive change in health beliefs and barriers. The results show that culturally adapted interventions appear to increase the rate of participation in cancer screening. In addition, the effectiveness of the interventions seems to be related to the use of small media, one-on-one interactions, small group education sessions, reminder strategies, and strategies for reducing structural barriers and out-of-pocket costs.Culturally adapted patient-targeted healthcare interventions can help to reduce racial or ethnic inequalities in access to cancer screening programmes. Further research is needed to develop interventions to promote adherence to cancer screening programmes with repeat testing and vigorous economic evaluation methodologies.",

     "abstract": "Worldwide, the burden of cancer is rising, stimulating efforts to develop strategies to control these diseases. Primary prevention, a key control strategy, aims to reduce cancer incidence through programs directed towards reducing population exposure to known causal factors. Before enacting such strategies, it is necessary to estimate the likely effect on cancer incidence if exposures to known causal factors were reduced or eliminated. The population attributable fraction (PAF) is the epidemiological measure which quantifies this potential reduction in incidence. We surveyed the literature to document and summarise the proportions of cancers across the globe attributable to modifiable causes, specifically tobacco smoke, alcohol, overweight/obesity, insufficient physical activity, solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation and dietary factors (insufficient fruit, non-starchy vegetables and fibre; red/processed meat; salt). In total, we identified 55 articles that presented PAF estimates for one or more causes. Information coverage was not uniform, with many articles reporting cancer PAFs due to overweight/obesity, alcohol and tobacco, but fewer reporting PAFs for dietary factors or solar UV radiation. At all cancer sites attributable to tobacco and alcohol, median PAFs were markedly lower for women than men. Smoking contributed to very high median PAFs (>50%) for cancers of the lung and larynx. Median PAFs for men, attributable to alcohol, were high (25\u201350%) for cancers of the oesophagus, oral cavity/pharynx, larynx and liver. For cancers causally associated with overweight/obesity, high median PAFs were reported for oesophageal adenocarcinoma (men 29%, women 37%), gallbladder (men 11%, women 42%) and endometrium (36%). The cancer PAF literature is growing rapidly. Repeating this survey in the future should lead to more precise estimates of the potentially preventable fractions of cancer.",

The age-standardised incidence rates of oesophageal adenocarcinoma were below 2 and 0.5 per 100 000 in men and women, respectively, across all periods in the all registers containing valid data on histological type. The age-standardised incidence rate of oesophageal adenocarcinoma slightly increased in Japan, Singapore, and Israel, although the net drift was statistically significant only in Israeli men (4.9%, 95% CI: 0.8%, 9.1%).The overall incidence rates of oesophageal cancer declined in most Asian countries, which is due to a decrease in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma incidence. However, attention needs to be paid to a probable beginning of an increasing incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in Asia.",

     "abstract": "Cancer is an increasing problem in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations). Tobacco use is a well-established risk factor for many types of cancers. Evidence on burden of cancer attributable to tobacco is essential to raise public and political awareness of the negative effects of tobacco on cancer and to be used to stimulate political action aims at reducing smoking prevalence in ASEAN member countries. The objective of this study was to estimate burden of cancer attributable to tobacco smoking in ASEAN, 2012.In this study, smoking prevalence was combined with Relative Risks (RRs) of cancer to obtain Smoking Attributable Fractions (SAFs). Cancer incidence and mortality data among individuals aged 15 years and older were derived from GLOBOCAN 2012. Fourteen types of cancer were included in the analysis. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine the impact of the use of alternative RRs and the use of alternative prevalence of smoking in some countries.The findings showed that tobacco smoking was responsible for 131,502 cancer incidence and 105,830 cancer mortality in ASEAN countries in 2012. In other words, tobacco smoking was accounted for 28.4% (43.3% in male and 8.5% in female) of cancer incidence and 30.5% (44.2% in male and 9.4% in female) of cancer mortality in ASEAN. When looking at the types of cancer, lung cancer showed the strongest association with tobacco smoking. Incidence of cancer and cancer mortality attributable to tobacco smoking varied by countries due to the differences in size of population, background risk of cancer, and prevalence of smoking in each country. According to the sensitivity analyses, RRs of lung cancer, pharynx cancer, and larynx cancer used in the estimates have significant impact on the estimates.As about one-third of cancer incidence and mortality in ASEAN are attributable to tobacco smoking ASEAN member countries are strongly encouraged to put in place stronger tobacco control policies and to strengthen the existing tobacco control measure in order to effectively control cancer.",

HPV incidence detected by PCR was 139/165 [84.2%] for Caucasians and 28/45 [62.2%] for minorities.

Thus we conclude that the factors underlying racial/ethnic disparities in HPVOPC incidence are likely to be similar across communities with different levels of urbanization and population diversity.",

Therefore, generation of high-quality regional data becomes highly relevant. Cancer data for the period of 2010\u20132015 representing the population from all districts of Karachi (14.6 million) are presented herein. After institutional approval (Ref no. IRB-459/DUHS/-14), a Pathology based cancer registry was established at the largest government-run diagnostic and reference center of Karachi. During 2010\u20132015, a total of 13,508 cancers (including 686 non-melanoma-skin-cancers (NMSC)) were diagnosed. Of these, 5665 (41.9%) were in males while 7843 (58.1%) were in females. Incidence rates for all cancers (excluding NMSC) were 66.7 per 100,000 (crude) and 105.1 per 100,000 (ASR) for males and 112.0 per 100,000 (crude) and 175.8 per 100,000 (ASR) for females. In males, cancer of lip and oral cavity was the most frequently diagnosed cancer (30.8%, ASR 33.1), followed by NMSC (7.7%, ASR 9.5) and colorectum (7%, ASR 7.3). In females, breast cancer was the most frequently recorded malignancy (49.5%, ASR 87.9), followed by lip and oral cavity (11.2%, ASR 22.0) and oesophagus (5.6%, ASR 10.7). We report that Karachi has the highest incidence of cancers of breast, lip and oral cavity, oesophagus and larynx in females and cancer of lip and oral cavity and larynx (2nd only to Turkey) in males compared to any of the Asian populations. Notably, incidence of tobacco associated cancers is very high in Karachi, demanding urgent attention by relevant authorities to address the un-controlled and drastically high consumption of various forms of tobacco in the city.",

     "abstract": "In most developed countries, incidence of cervical cancer declined likely due to well-established cervical cancer screening programs. However, such decline has not been identified in Eastern Europe, where such programs are not well established.This study utilized data of the Bulgarian Cancer Registry for the period 1993\u20132013. Age-standardized incidence and mortality trends were analyzed using Joinpoint regression. Maps were created to illustrate spatial distributions of rates.The northern region of Bulgaria showed a larger cervical cancer burden than the southern region and rural women tended to be diagnosed at older ages (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and later stages (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) than urban women. The distribution of disease stages changed over the 21 years, with most common stages of diagnosis being stage II in 1993 (39.2%) to stage I in 2013 (44.7%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). While age-standardized mortality slightly increased over the 21 years (from 4.8 to 5.2 per 100,000; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), age-standardized incidence increased from 14.0 to 21.4 per 100,000 up until 2006 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), after which it plateaued.The lack of a similar plateau in mortality may be because the second most prevalent stage of diagnosis in recent years was stage III, indicating diagnosis at advanced symptomatic stages. Cervical cancer incidence is expected to continue to decrease if screening programs are strengthened and human papillomavirus vaccines are widely utilized. As Bulgaria has shared cervical cancer trends with other Eastern European countries in the past, it may be beneficial to develop future prevention interventions based on a regional, rather than a country-specific level.",

It was based on a case-control design with bootstrapping to derive standardized mortality ratios (SMR). The cases were defined by the cancer-PD or cancer-MS co-registrations, whereas the controls were drawn from the remaining records with cancer deaths (matching criteria: sex, age, language region of Switzerland, subperiods 1969\u20131981, 1982\u20131994, 1995\u20132007).For PD we found lower SMRs in lung and liver cancer and higher SMRs in melanoma/skin cancer, and in cancers of breast and prostate. As for MS, the SMR in lung cancer was lower than expected, whereas SMRs in colorectal, breast and bladder cancer were higher.A common pattern of associations can be observed in PD and MS, with a lower risk of lung cancer and higher risk of breast cancer than expected. Thus, PD and MS resemble other conditions with similar (schizophrenia) or reversed patterns (rheumatoid arthritis, immunosuppression after organ transplantation).",

We aimed to provide a comparison of the trend in quadrant-specific breast cancer incidence between the United States (US) and England, and determine whether a disproportionate UOQ increase is present.Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registry data were obtained on 630,007 female breast cancers from 1975 to 2013. English cancer registry data were obtained on 1,121,134 female breast cancers from 1979 to 2013. Temporal incidence changes were analysed using negative binomial regression. Interaction terms determined whether incidence changes were similar between sites.English breast cancer incidence in the UOQ rose significantly from 13% to 28% from 1979 to 2013 whereas no significant increase was observed among SEER data. The significant interaction between quadrant and year of diagnosis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in both SEER and English data indicates that breast cancer incidence in each quadrant changed at a different rate. Incidence in the UOQ rose disproportionately compared to the nipple (SEER IRR\u00a0=\u00a00.81, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; England IRR\u00a0=\u00a00.78, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and axillary tail (SEER IRR\u00a0=\u00a00.87, p\u00a0=\u00a00.018; England IRR\u00a0=\u00a00.69, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in both SEER and England. In addition, incidence rose disproportionately in the UOQ compared to non-site-specific tumours in England (Overlapping lesions IRR\u00a0=\u00a00.81, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; NOS IRR\u00a0=\u00a00.78, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The proportion of non-site-specific tumours was substantially higher in England than SEER throughout the study period (62% in England; 39% in SEER).Breast cancer incidence in the UOQ increased disproportionately compared to non-site-specific tumours in England but not in SEER, likely due to the decrease in non-site-specific tumours observed in England over time. There may be real differences in incidence between the two countries, possibly due to differences in aetiology, but is much more likely to be an artefact of changing data collection methods and improvements in site coding in either country.",

In women the rates of cancer of all sites were also highest in US women followed by Israeli Jews, Cyprus, Israeli Arabs, Izmir (Turkey), and lowest in Jordan. It is of interest that although site-specific cancer rates differ between the countries studied, prostate, lung and colorectal cancers are within the five most common cancers males in all countries studied. In females, breast colorectal and endometrium cancers are three of the five most common cancers in females in all countries studied.

A trend toward significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07) for a recessive model was found for GSTP1 (OR: 2.04; CI: 0.94-4.4).

We estimated cancer risks for children who had a full sibling or a half sibling with a CM using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. To control for confounding related to change of family structure, we estimated cancer risks for children from core families and children from broken families separately. Children were followed from birth up to 30 years of age (median follow-up 13.6 years).

We evaluated control of confounding by comparing HRs obtained via multivariable modeling (MM), propensity score weighting (PSW), and propensity score matching (PSM).Just over one-third of colon cancer patients did not receive ACT, and the proportion increased with age. Overall, receipt of ACT conferred an absolute (MR difference [No ACT rate\u2013ACT rate] 25.4 deaths/1000 person-years [py], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 19.1\u201332.7 deaths/1000 py) and relative (MM HR\u00a0=\u00a00.67, 95% CI: 0.59\u20130.76) survival benefit. The survival benefit was demonstrated across age groups. MM and propensity score methods yielded highly similar HRs.Unless contraindicated, efforts to ensure receipt of ACT for stage III colon cancer patients up to 84 years of age are needed to improve the prognosis of patients with node-positive disease.",

     "abstract": "Socioeconomic status (SES) is a complex construct of multiple indicators, known to impact cancer outcomes, but has not been adequately examined among pediatric AML patients. This study aimed to identify the patterns of co-occurrence of multiple community-level SES indicators and to explore associations between various patterns of these indicators and pediatric AML mortality risk. A nationally representative US sample of 3651 pediatric AML patients, aged 0\u201319 years at diagnosis was drawn from 17 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database registries created between 1973 and 2012. Factor analysis, cluster analysis, stratified univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used. Four SES factors accounting for 87% of the variance in SES indicators were identified: F1) economic/educational disadvantage, less immigration; F2) immigration-related features (foreign-born, language-isolation, crowding), less mobility; F3) housing instability; and, F4) absence of moving. F1 and F3 showed elevated risk of mortality, adjusted hazards ratios (aHR) (95% CI): 1.07(1.02\u20131.12) and 1.05(1.00\u20131.10), respectively. Seven SES-defined cluster groups were identified. Cluster 1 (low economic/educational disadvantage, few immigration-related features, and residential-stability) showed the minimum risk of mortality. Compared to Cluster 1, Cluster 3 (high economic/educational disadvantage, high-mobility) and Cluster 6 (moderately-high economic/educational disadvantages, housing-instability and immigration-related features) exhibited substantially greater risk of mortality, aHR(95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.19(1.0\u20131.4) and 1.23 (1.1\u20131.5), respectively. Factors of correlated SES-indicators and their pattern-based groups demonstrated differential risks in the pediatric AML mortality indicating the need of special public-health attention in areas with economic-educational disadvantages, housing-instability and immigration-related features.",

Data from two 5-year periods were analyzed: 1990\u20131994 and 2005\u20132009. Numerator data were abstracted from national death files where the cause was malignant neoplasm of prostate (prostate cancer) (ICD9\u00a0=\u00a0185 and ICD10\u00a0=\u00a0C61). Population-based denominators were obtained from US Census data. To measure the racial disparity, we calculated non-Hispanic Black: non-Hispanic White rate ratios (RRs), rate differences (RDs), and corresponding confidence intervals for each 5-year period. We also calculated correlation and unadjusted regression coefficients for 11 city-level variables, such as segregation and median income, and the RDs.At the final time point (2005\u20132009), the US and all 41 cities included in the analyses had a RR greater than 1 (indicating that the Black rate was higher than the White rate) (range\u00a0=\u00a01.13 in Minneapolis to 3.24 in Los Angeles), 37 of them statistically significantly so. The US and 26 of the 41 cities saw an increase in the Black:White RR between the time points. The level of disparity within a city was associated with the degree of Black segregation.This analysis revealed large disparities in Black:White prostate cancer mortality in the US and many of its largest cities over the past two decades. The data show considerable variation in the degree of disparity across cities, even among cities within the same state. This type of specific city-level data can be used to motivate public health professionals, government officials, cancer control agencies, and community-based organizations in cities with large or increasing disparities to demand more resources, focus research efforts, and implement effective policy and programmatic changes in order to combat this highly prevalent condition.",

     "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is the most frequent malignant pediatric brain tumor. While survival rates have improved due to multimodal treatment including cisplatin-based chemotherapy, there are few prognostic factors for adverse treatment outcomes. Notably, genes involved in the nucleotide excision repair pathway, including ERCC2, have been implicated in cisplatin sensitivity in other cancers. Therefore, this study evaluated the role of ERCC2 DNA methylation profiles on pediatric medulloblastoma survival.The study population included 71 medulloblastoma patients (age <18\u00a0years at diagnosis) and recruited from Texas Children\u2019s Cancer Center between 2004 and 2009. DNA methylation profiles were generated from peripheral blood samples using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 Beadchip. Sixteen ERCC2-associated CpG sites were evaluated in this analysis. Multivariable regression models were used to determine the adjusted association between DNA methylation and survival. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare 5-year overall survival between hyper- and hypo-methylation at each CpG site.In total, 12.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a09) of the patient population died within five years of diagnosis. In our population, methylation of the cg02257300 probe (Hazard Ratio\u00a0=\u00a09.33; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.17\u201374.64) was associated with death (log-rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). This association remained suggestive after correcting for multiple comparisons (FDR p\u00a0<\u00a00.2). No other ERCC2-associated CpG site was associated with survival in this population of pediatric medulloblastoma patients.These findings provide the first evidence that DNA methylation within the promoter region of the ERCC2 gene may be associated with survival in pediatric medulloblastoma. If confirmed in future studies, this information may lead to improved risk stratification or promote the development of novel, targeted therapeutics.",

We analyzed the time trends of advanced-stage breast cancer incidence rates in the target population before and after implementation of the MSP in a region of northwestern Germany.The MSP in the M\u00fcnster district started in October 2005. A total of 13,874 women with an incident invasive breast cancer (BC) was identified by the population-based epidemiological cancer registry between 2000 and 2013 in the target group 50\u201369 years. Multiple imputation methods were used to replace missing data on tumor stages (10.4%). The incidence rates for early-stage (UICC I) and advanced-stage (UICC II+) BC were determined, and Poisson regression analyses were performed to assess trends over time.The incidence rates for UICC I breast cancers increased during the step-up introduction of the MSP and remained elevated thereafter. By contrast, after increasing from 2006 to 2008, the incidence rates of UICC II+ breast cancers decreased to levels below the pre-screening period. Significantly decreasing UICC II+ incidence rates were limited to the age group 55\u201369 years and reached levels that were significantly lower than incidence rates in the pre-screening period.The incidence rates of advanced-stage breast cancers decreased in the age groups from 55 years to the upper age limit for screening eligibility, but not in the adjacent age groups. The findings are consistent with MSP lead time effects and seem to indicate that the MSP lowers advanced-stage breast cancer rates in the target population.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey report concerned to FP counseling and procedures in pediatric and adolescent cancer patients in Switzerland. This survey was conducted from June 2014 to October 2014 on the counseling and procedures performed between 2009 and 2013; the questionnaire was completed by one of the professional from hematology/oncology centers in Switzerland. Currently, only four out of nine centers have a program for FP. In 2013, 45/301 (15%) patients received FP counseling and 36/301 (12%) underwent an FP procedure. The most commonly performed procedures from 2009 to 2013 were administration of gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (3%) and cryopreservation of ovarian tissue in females (3%) and cryopreservation of sperms in males (6%); the most frequently cited reason for the absence of FP counseling was lack of time (55%). Therefore, this survey should help to develop and harmonize practices with respect to FP counseling and procedures in Switzerland, and to establish FP as a standard of care during cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "Regular screening with mammography is widely recommended to reduce breast cancer mortality. However, whether breast screening does more harm than good has long been debated. Since a full evaluation of the effect on mortality could take 10\u201315 years in order to provide a reliable estimate of the eventual benefits and harms, it is unrealistic to expect each new modification of a screening technique to be evaluated in this way. Therefore, one needs to rapidly estimate suitable measures of the screening effect. In this paper, two measures of interest, the length of the pre-clinical state and the screening false negative rate, are discussed. A procedure is proposed to model the pre-clinical disease state duration, the false negative rate of the screening exam, and the underlying incidence rate in the screened population. We applied the model to data from the Ontario Breast Screening Program in Canada. Our results suggest that the mean preclinical duration is longer than 2 years. We also find only small marginal gains by screening every two instead of three years. The most important objective of a screening program should be to encourage first-time screening attendance.",

Delaying or forgoing care due to depression may further augment poor HRQOL. Although several studies have documented depression as a barrier to health care utilization in non-cancer populations, the impact of current depression on health care utilization among adult cancer survivors (ACS) has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to examine the association between current depression and health care utlization among ACS.Data from the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System involving ACS were used in this study. The Patient Health Questionnaire 8 (PHQ-8) item scale was used to measure current depression. Two indicators of health care utilization were examined as outcomes of interest: cost as a barrier to medical care and not having a routine care. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between current depression and health care utilization.Overall, 13.0% of ACS reported symptoms of current depression. Despite no differences in having access to care, current depression in ACS was a significant barrier to health care utilization: cost as a barrier to medical care (AOR: 5.3 [95% CI: 3.1\u20139.1]), and not having a routine care (AOR: 2.0 [95% CI: 1.2\u20133.3]).Our findings have implications for future studies to further understand the association between depression and health care utlization among ACS, its impact on their overall wellbeing, and efforts to detect and treat depression in ACS. Routine assessment of depression in ACS and effective treatment interventions may aid in seeking timely and appropriate medical care.",

Recent studies have brought this practice into question, arguing that varying registry reference dates affect the ability to identify earlier cancers, resulting in selection bias. We used a theoretical approach to evaluate the extent to which the length of registry operations affects the classification of first versus subsequent cancers and consequently survival estimates.Sequence number central was used to classify tumors from the New York State Cancer Registry, diagnosed 2001\u20132010, as either first primaries (value\u00a0=\u00a00 or 1) or subsequent primaries (\u22652). A set of three sequence numbers, each based on an assumed reference year (1976, 1986 or 1996), was assigned to each tumor. Percent of subsequent cancers was evaluated by reference year, cancer site and age. 5-year relative survival estimates were compared under four different selection scenarios.The percent of cancer cases classified as subsequent primaries was 15.3%, 14.3% and 11.2% for reference years 1976, 1986 and 1996, respectively; and varied by cancer site and age. When only the first primary was included, shorter registry operation time was associated with slightly lower 5-year survival estimates. When all primary cancers were included, survival estimates decreased, with the largest decreases seen for the earliest reference year.Registry operation length affected the identification of subsequent cancers, but the overall effect of this misclassification on survival estimates was small. Survival estimates based on all primary cancers were slightly lower, but might be more comparable across registries.",

We describe the burden of CRC in the region and review the current status of disease control.We obtained regional- and national-level incidence data from 48 population-based cancer registries in 13 countries, as well as cancer deaths from the WHO mortality database for 18 countries. We estimated world population age-standardized incidence (ASR) and mortality (ASMR) rates per 100,000 person-years for 2003\u20132007 and the estimated annual percentage change for 1997\u20132008.The CRC rate in males was 1\u20132 times higher than that in females. In 2003\u20132007, the highest ASRs were seen in Uruguayan, Brazilian and Argentinean males (25.2\u201334.2) and Uruguayan and Brazilian females (21.5\u201324.7), while El Salvador had the lowest ASR in both sexes (males: 1.5, females: 1.3). ASMRs were\u00a0<10 for both sexes, except in Uruguay, Cuba and Argentina (10.0\u201317.7 and 11.3\u201312.0). CRC incidence is increasing in Chilean males. Most countries have national screening guidelines. Uruguay and Argentina have implemented national screening programs.Geographic variation in CRC and sex gaps may be explained by differences in the prevalence of obesity, physical inactivity, diet, smoking and alcohol consumption, early detection, and cancer registration practices. Establishing optimal CRC screening programs is challenging due to lack of healthcare access and coverage, funding, regional differences and inadequate infrastructure, and may not be feasible. Given the current status of CRC in the region, data generated by population-based cancer registries is crucial for cancer control planning.",

Trends in incidence and mortality of GBC remained unchanged in Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Costa Rica in 1998\u20132008.GBC rates varied extensively across the CSA region reflecting, in part, differences in data quality, coverage and healthcare access. Chile had the highest GBC rates in CSA and the world. The large proportion of unspecified cases indicates low precision in diagnosis/registration and highlights the need to promote and improve cancer registration in the region to better understand the burden of GBC in CSA.",

We present data on melanoma incidence calculated in a standardized way for Central and South America, as well as an overview of primary and secondary prevention issues in the region.Cancer registry data on all incident cases reported in the different registries present in Central and South America were combined to provide registry-based country estimates of age-standardized, sex-specific cutaneous melanoma incidence overall, and by histological subtype and anatomical site. A literature search provided additional information.Age-standardized incidence rates were between 1 and 5 per 100,000 and tended to be higher further away from the equator. Cutaneous melanomas of the acral type, mostly occurring on the lower limbs, are a distinguishing feature of melanoma in Central and South America in comparison with high-incidence areas. Several preventive measures, both primary and secondary, are in place, albeit largely without evaluation.Due to incomplete registration and different registration practices, reliable and comparable data on melanoma were difficult to obtain; thus it is likely that the true burden of melanoma in Central and South America has been underestimated. The different characteristics of the cutaneous melanoma patient population in terms of anatomical site and histological type distribution imply a need for adapted primary and secondary prevention measures. The generally high ambient ultraviolet radiation levels require sufficient sun protection measures.",

Although several population-based registries exist in the region, few comprehensive analyses have been conducted to describe the status of cervical cancer control.Population-based data from cancer registries in 13 countries and mortality data from 18 countries in CSA were analyzed. Standardized incidence and mortality rates were estimated and time trend analysis performed when information was available. In addition, a search of available data on HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening was carried out.Cervical cancer incidence and mortality have decreased in some CSA countries, with an annual percentage change from \u22124.2 to \u22126.7 for incidence and \u22120.2 to \u22128.3 for mortality. In total, seven countries have age-standardized mortality rates over 10 per 100,000 women, generally corresponding to those with the lowest income levels. All countries have implemented screening programs with different extents of coverage and levels of organization. To date, nine countries have introduced HPV vaccination in national immunization programs.Despite incidence declines observed in some countries, cervical cancer mortality remained almost stable in most countries in the region. Decreases in mortality trends in Chile and Costa Rica are probably the result of early detection programs. Better organized programs might favor greater impact on cancer incidence and mortality, but technological developments offer more suitable opportunities for prevention and alternative approaches for screening of precancerous lesions.",

Survival information for all patients identified as either Indigenous (n\u00a0=\u00a03168) or non-Indigenous (n\u00a0=\u00a0211,615) and diagnosed in Queensland between 1997 and 2012 were obtained from the Queensland Cancer Registry, with mortality followed up to 31st December, 2013. Flexible parametric survival models were used to quantify changes in the cause-specific survival inequalities and the number of lives that might be saved if these inequalities were removed. Among Indigenous cancer patients, the 5-year cause-specific survival (adjusted by age, sex and broad cancer type) increased from 52.9% in 1997\u20132006 to 58.6% in 2007\u20132012, while it improved from 61.0% to 64.9% among non-Indigenous patients.

Using a simulated cohort corresponding to the number and age-distribution of Indigenous people diagnosed with cancer in Queensland each year (n\u00a0=\u00a0300), based on the 1997\u20132006 cohort mortality rates, 35 of the 170 deaths due to cancer (21%) expected within five years of diagnosis were due to the Indigenous: non-Indigenous survival inequality. This percentage was similar when applying 2007\u20132012 cohort mortality rates (19%; 27 out of 140 deaths). Indigenous people diagnosed with cancer still face a poorer survival outlook than their non-Indigenous counterparts, particularly in the first year after diagnosis. The improving survival outcomes among both Indigenous and non-Indigenous cancer patients, and the decreasing absolute impact of the Indigenous survival disadvantage, should provide increased motivation to continue and enhance current strategies to further reduce the impact of the survival inequalities faced by Indigenous people diagnosed with cancer.",

Temporal trends were examined using Joinpoint regression.There were 17,279 GCTs (552 paediatric, 16,727 adult). Age-specific incidence in males (all histologies combined) was bimodal, with peaks during infancy for most sites, and second, larger, peaks during young adulthood. Incidence of ovarian tumours peaked at age 15\u201319. Around half of paediatric tumours were extragonadal, whereas adult tumours were mostly gonadal. Yolk sac tumours and teratomas predominated in infants, whereas germinomas became more frequent towards adulthood. Increasing incidence trends for some adult gonadal tumours have stabilised; the trend for male extragonadal tumours is also declining.Broad similarities in the shape of age-specific incidence curves, particularly for gonadal, central nervous system, and mediastinal tumours provide epidemiological support for commonalities in aetiology among clinically disparate GCT subtypes. Differences in peak ages reflect underlying subtype-specific biological differences. Declining incidence trends for some adult gonadal tumours accords with the global transition in GCT incidence, and supports the possibility of a reduction in prevalence of shared aetiological exposures.",

Crude rate (CR), age-standardized rate (ASR), and age-specific rate were calculated for the period 1980\u20132013 and projected for the period 2014\u20132020 using a Bayesian log-linear Poisson model.All calculated rates were greater for BC than for LC in 2013 (CR, 27.3 versus 17.3; ASR, 13.5 versus 9.3), and the CR was not projected to change by 2020 (29.2 versus 27.6). The ASR for LC is expected to surpass that of BC in 2019 (12.9 versus 12.7).By 2020 the LC mortality rates may exceed those of BC for ages 55\u201374 years, possibly because of the prevalence of smoking among women, and the screening for and more effective treatment of BC.

The patient group who did not receive preoperative therapy or radiotherapy followed by radical resection had a lower observed survival compared to the patient group receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy. The patient groups who underwent abdominoperineal excision and those receiving adjuvant chemotherapy had a worse observed survival compared to the patient group treated with sphincter-sparing surgery and no adjuvant therapy respectively. These effects were age-dependent. Multivariable analysis demonstrated similar findings for the observed survival conditional on surviving the first year since surgery.In this population-based study among clinical stage I\u2013III rectal cancer patients treated with radical resection, a superior observed survival was noticed in the patient group receiving preoperative chemoradiotherapy compared to the patients groups receiving no or preoperative radiotherapy only, adjusting for case mix, type of radical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, higher adjusted observed survival was also detected for the patient groups with sphincter-sparing surgery or no adjuvant chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women in the US, and despite numerous studies documenting racial disparities in outcomes, the survival difference between Black and White women diagnosed with breast cancer continues to widen. Few studies have assessed whether observed racial disparities in outcomes vary by insurance type e.g. Medicare/Medicaid versus private insurance. Differences in coverage, availability of networked physicians, or cost-sharing policies may influence choice of treatment and treatment outcomes, even after patients have been hospitalized, effects of which may be differential by race.The aim of this analysis was to examine hospitalization outcomes among patients with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer and assess whether differences in outcome exist by insurance status after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity and socio-economic status.We obtained data on over 67,000 breast cancer patients with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer for this cross-sectional study from the 2007\u20132011 Healthcare Cost and Utilization project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS), and examined breast cancer surgery type (mastectomy vs. breast conserving surgery or BCS), post-surgical complications and in-hospital mortality. Multivariable regression models were used to compute estimates, odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.Black patients were less likely to receive mastectomies compared with White women (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71\u20130.90), regardless of whether they had Medicare/Medicaid or Private insurance. Black patients were also more likely to experience post-surgical complications (OR: 1.41, 95% CI: 1.12\u20131.78) and higher in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.57, 95%: 1.21\u20132.03) compared with White patients, associations that were strongest among women with Private insurance. Women residing outside of large metropolitan areas were significantly more likely to receive mastectomies (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.54\u20132.31) and experience higher in-hospital mortality (OR: 1.74, 95% CI: 1.40\u20132.16) compared with those in metropolitan areas, regardless of insurance type.Among hospitalized patients with breast cancer, racial differences in hospitalization outcomes existed and worse outcomes were observed among Black women with private insurance.

     "abstract": "Iodine deficiency may play a role in thyroid cancer carcinogenesis. Because Thailand has region-specific historical iodine deficiency, it is ideal to evaluate the potential impact of recent national iodine supplementation policies on thyroid cancer incidence trends.We examined thyroid cancer trends in Thailand from 1990 to 2009 in three geographically separated populations (Songkhla Province [south], Chiang Mai Province [north], and Khon Kaen Province [northeast]), each with a different historical prevalence of iodine deficiency. We used Joinpoint analysis and age-period-cohort (APC) models to investigate trends in thyroid cancer incidence.Pooled incidence of papillary cancers significantly increased (Males APC: 2.0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; Females APC: 7.3 [1990\u20132001, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05], \u22122.1 [2001\u20132009]) and incidence of follicular cancers significantly decreased (Males APC: \u22125.2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; Females APC: \u22124.3 [1990\u20131998, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05], 12.3 [1998\u20132001], \u221217.0 [2001\u20132005, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05], 8.2 [2005\u20132009]) in both males and females between 1990 and 2009. The largest increases in papillary cancer incidence, and the largest decreases in follicular cancer incidence, occurred in historically iodine-deficient regions. Interestingly, the significant histological changes coincided with Thailand\u2019s most recent national iodination policy. The thyroid cancer trends in females were better explained by period effects than cohort effects.This study adds to the research indicating that papillary carcinoma incidence increases, and follicular carcinoma incidence decreases, as population-level iodine deficiency declines, and suggests that iodine exposure may affect late stages of thyroid carcinogenesis. However, our findings are limited by the ecological study design and lack of data prior to iodine supplementation.",

     "abstract": "Area-based socioeconomic measures are widely used in health research. In theory, the larger the area used the more individual misclassification is introduced, thus biasing the association between such area level measures and health outcomes. In this study, we examined the socioeconomic disparities in cancer survival using two geographic area-based measures to see if the size of the area matters.We used population-based cancer registry data for patients diagnosed with one of 10 major cancers in New South Wales (NSW), Australia during 2004\u20132008. Patients were assigned index measures of socioeconomic status (SES) based on two area-level units, census Collection District (CD) and Local Government Area (LGA) of their address at diagnosis. Five-year relative survival was estimated using the period approach for patients alive during 2004\u20132008, for each socioeconomic quintile at each area-level for each cancer. Poisson-regression modelling was used to adjust for socioeconomic quintile, sex, age-group at diagnosis and disease stage at diagnosis. The relative excess risk of death (RER) by socioeconomic quintile derived from this modelling was compared between area-units.We found extensive disagreement in SES classification between CD and LGA levels across all socioeconomic quintiles, particularly for more disadvantaged groups. In general, more disadvantaged patients had significantly lower survival than the least disadvantaged group for both CD and LGA classifications. The socioeconomic survival disparities detected by CD classification were larger than those detected by LGA. Adjusted RER estimates by SES were similar for most cancers when measured at both area levels.We found that classifying patient SES by the widely used Australian geographic unit LGA results in underestimation of survival disparities for several cancers compared to when SES is classified at the geographically smaller CD level. Despite this, our RER of death estimates derived from these survival estimates were generally similar for both CD and LGA level analyses, suggesting that LGAs remain a valuable spatial unit for use in Australian health and social research, though the potential for misclassification must be considered when interpreting research. While data confidentiality concerns increase with the level of geographical precision, the use of smaller area-level health and census data in the future, with appropriate allowance for confidentiality",

We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and compared trends.While the IRRs were rarely significant, there were significant differences in incidence rate estimates for Hispanic males. Additionally, interpretation of trends varied by the estimate source: the ACS-based lung cancer incidence rate estimate for Hispanic females increased from 70.59 (95% CI 44.85, 110.67) to 86.13 (95% CI 54.83, 132.44) per 100,000 women from 2007 to 2010, while the SEER incidence rate estimate decreased from 80.76 (95% CI 53.36, 119.24) to 73.54 (95% CI 49.24, 106.62).Inconsistencies were found when comparing incidence rate estimates for small population groups using the two population estimate sources.

     "abstract": "Cadmium, a human carcinogenic heavy metal, has been reported to be associated with breast cancer risk; however, the results from the epidemiological studies are not always consistent. The objective of this study was to quantitatively summarize the current evidence for the relationship between cadmium exposure and breast cancer risk using meta-analysis methods. Six studies determining the dietary cadmium intake level and five studies evaluating the urinary cadmium level were identified in a systematic search of MEDLINE and PubMed databases, and the associations between these levels and breast cancer risk were analysed. The pooled estimates under the random-effects model suggested that higher urinary cadmium levels were associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (highest versus lowest quantile, pooled odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a02.24, 95% confidence interval [95%CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.49\u20133.35) and a 1\u00a0\u03bcg/g creatinine increase in urinary cadmium led to a 1.02-fold increment of breast cancer (pooled OR\u00a0=\u00a02.02, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.34\u20133.03); however, pooled estimates for dietary cadmium intake found no significant association between cadmium exposure and breast cancer risk (highest versus lowest quantile, pooled relative risk [RR]\u00a0=\u00a01.01, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.89\u20131.15). These results suggest that cadmium exposure may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer, and urinary cadmium levels can serve as a reliable biomarker for long-term cadmium exposure and may predict the breast cancer risk.",

However, there are very limited available data on population-based, subtype-specific incidence rates of LMs in the East Asian population, particularly in Chinese. Using data from the Hong Kong (HK) Cancer Registry and United States (U.S.) SEER Program, we calculated and compared age-adjusted incidence rates of LM subtypes in HK to those in Whites and Asians living in the U.S. Overall and sex-specific rates were calculated for the period 2001\u2fff2010. The incidence of most subtypes was low in the HK population, with rates <1 case per 100,000 for all subtypes except for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (3.26/100,000) and plasma cell neoplasms (1.99/100,000). Age-adjusted incidence rates of all evaluated B-cell subtypes were significantly higher in U.S. Whites compared to HK, with standardized rate ratios (SRRs) ranging from 1.6 (Burkitt lymphoma) to 9.1 (chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma). Rates in U.S. Asians were generally intermediate to those in U.S. Whites and HK. Conversely, rates of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma were significantly lower in both U.S. Whites (SRR\u00a0=\u00a00.2) and U.S. Asians (SRR\u00a0=\u00a00.5) compared to HK. Our data provide new insight into the subtype-specific patterns of LMs in the Chinese population, and suggest the need for etiological studies of LMs in the East Asian population to elucidate the factors responsible for these differences in the geographic incidence patterns.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether CPM usage differs by racial/ethnic group and ER/PR status among patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data.The study subjects were women with histologically confirmed unilateral breast cancer who underwent breast surgery between 1998 and 2011. Age-adjusted CPM use as a proportion of all surgically treated patients or all patients who had mastectomy was analyzed by racial/ethnic group, tumor behavior, and ER/PR status. Temporal trends in age-adjusted CPM use were presented by ER/PR status and racial/ethnic group.The analyses stratified by ER/PR status showed significant racial/ethnic differences in age-adjusted CPM use with non-Hispanic White and non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (API) patients having the most and least CPM use. Age-adjusted CPM use was significantly higher for ER+/PR+ tumors than ER\u2fff/PR\u2fff ones for each race/ethnicity group among patients with mastectomy. However, among patients with any breast surgeries, the only difference was a higher proportion of CPM use for ER\u2fff/PR\u2fff tumors (8.6%) than ER+/PR+ tumors (8.0%) in non-Hispanic Whites. CPM use has increased over time in all racial/ethnic groups despite ER/PR status.CPM usage was lower not only in non-Hispanic Blacks, but also in non-Hispanic API and Hispanic patients compared to non-Hispanic White patients. CPM usage tended to be higher for ER+/PR+ tumors, but the results varied when different denominators (all mastectomies vs. all breast surgeries) were used.",

The aim was to assess to what extent progress against childhood and adolescent cancer has been made in Austria since the 1990s and to complement the childhood and adolescent cancer trends for Central Europe.All malignant neoplasms and non-malignant tumours of the Central Nervous System (CNS) in patients aged less than 20 years and diagnosed between 1994 and 2011 (N\u00a0=\u00a05425) were derived from the Austrian National Cancer Registry (ANCR).

Longitudinal data sources on GCTB are sparse, limited to single institution case series or surgical outcomes studies. The Swedish Cancer Registry is one of the few national population-based databases recording GCTB, representing a unique source to study GCTB epidemiology. We estimated incidence rate (IR) and overall mortality rates based on registry data.We identified patients with a GCTB diagnosis in the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1983 to 2011: benign (ICD-7 196.0\u2013196.9; PAD 741) and malignant (PAD 746). Results were stratified by age at diagnosis, gender, and anatomical lesion location.The cohort included 337 GCTB cases (IR of 1.3 per million persons per year). The majority (n\u00a0=\u00a0310) had primary benign GCTB (IR of 1.2 per million per year). Median age at diagnosis was 34 years (range 10\u201388) with 54% (n\u00a0=\u00a0183) females. Malignant to benign ratio for women was 0.095 (16/167) and for men 0.077 (11/143). Incidence was highest in the 20\u201339 years age group (IR of 2.1 per million per year). The most common lesion sites were distal femur and proximal tibia. Mortality at 20 years from diagnosis was 14% (n\u00a0=\u00a048) and was slightly higher for axial (17%; n\u00a0=\u00a06) and pelvic (17%; n\u00a0=\u00a04) lesions. Recurrence occurred in 39% of primary benign cases and 75% of primary malignant cases.In our modern population-based series primary malignant cases were uncommon (8%), peak incidence 20\u201339 years with slight predominance in women. Recurrence rates remain significant with overall 39% occurring in benign GCTB, and 75% in malignant form.

We examined the trends in CRC incidence and associated lifestyle risk factors in Canadians aged 15\u2fff49.Incidence data for colorectal, colon and rectum/rectosigmoid cancers were obtained for 1969\u2fff2010 from the Canadian Cancer Registry, and trends in age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) were examined by Joinpoint regression for three age groups (15\u2fff29, 30\u2fff39, 40\u2fff49 years) and by sex. Trends in the prevalence of some CRC risk factors were similarly examined from national health surveys for various periods ranging from 1970 to 2012.In both sexes combined, ASIRs rose by 6.7%/year (1997\u2fff2010) for 15\u2fff29-year-olds, 2.4%/year (1996\u2fff2010) for 30\u2fff39-year-olds, and 0.8%/year (1997\u2fff2010) for 40\u2fff49-year-olds. Similar trends were observed by sex. The rise in ASIR was more rapid for cancers of the rectum/rectosigmoid compared to colon for all age groups. Risk factor trends varied: excess weight rose substantially, vegetables and fruit consumption increased slightly, physical inactivity rates declined but remained high, alcohol consumption changed little, and smoking rates declined. Data on red/processed meat consumption were unavailable.The ASIR of CRC in young Canadians has increased since about the mid-1990s. The rising prevalence of excess weight in younger generations has likely played a role in the CRC trend, but more research is needed.",

We explored the popularly hypothesised association between brain cancer incidence and mobile phone use.Using national cancer registration data, we examined age and gender specific incidence rates of 19,858 male and 14,222 females diagnosed with brain cancer in Australia between 1982 and 2012, and mobile phone usage data from 1987 to 2012. We modelled expected age specific rates (20\u2fff39, 40\u2fff59, 60\u2fff69, 70\u2fff84 years), based on published reports of relative risks (RR) of 1.5 in ever-users of mobile phones, and RR of 2.5 in a proportion of \u2fffheavy users\u2fff (19% of all users), assuming a 10-year lag period between use and incidence.Age adjusted brain cancer incidence rates (20\u2fff84 years, per 100,000) have risen slightly in males (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but were stable over 30 years in females (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) and are higher in males 8.7 (CI\u00a0=\u00a08.1\u2fff9.3) than in females, 5.8 (CI\u00a0=\u00a05.3\u2fff6.3). Assuming a causal RR of 1.5 and 10-year lag period, the expected incidence rate in males in 2012 would be 11.7 (11\u2fff12.4) and in females 7.7 (CI\u00a0=\u00a07.2\u2fff8.3), both p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; 1434 cases observed in 2012, vs. 1867 expected. Significant increases in brain cancer incidence were observed (in keeping with modelled rates) only in those aged \u2fe570 years (both sexes), but the increase in incidence in this age group began from 1982, before the introduction of mobile phones. Modelled expected incidence rates were higher in all age groups in comparison to what was observed. Assuming a causal RR of 2.5 among \u2fffheavy users\u2fff gave 2038 expected cases in all age groups.This is an ecological trends analysis, with no data on individual mobile phone use and outcome.The observed stability of brain cancer incidence in Australia between 1982 and 2012 in all age groups except in those over 70 years compared to increasing modelled expected estimates, suggests that the observed increases in brain cancer incidence in the older age group are unlikely to be related to mobile phone use. Rather, we hypothesize that the observed increases in brain cancer incidence in Australia are related to the advent of improved diagnostic procedures when computed tomography and related imaging technologies were introduced in the early 1980s.",

We evaluated the hypothesis that MetS is a GERD-independent mechanism by which obesity is associated with increased risks of BE and EA using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. BE cases (n\u00a0=\u00a010,215) and EA cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0592) were each individually matched to five population controls based on age, sex, and general practice. MetS was defined as occurrence of at least three of the following: obesity, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol.

No association between MetS and risk of EA was detected in the main or stratified analyses. In this large population-based case-control study, individuals with MetS had a marginally increased risk of BE in the absence of GERD.

Although developmental factors have been implicated in the origins of PBTs in both human and animal studies, associations between early-life factors and PBTs have not been evaluated in individuals with NF1. Our objective was to evaluate associations between peri-gestational characteristics and PBTs in this population.We conducted a cross-sectional study, ascertaining questionnaire and medical record data for 606 individuals\u00a0<18\u00a0years old who enrolled in the NF1 Patient Registry Initiative (NPRI) from 6/9/2011-6/29/2015. One hundred eighty-four individuals had reported PBT diagnoses, including 65 who were identified with OPG diagnoses. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between PBT and OPG diagnoses and peri-gestational characteristics (prematurity, birth weight, parental age, plurality, family history of NF1, assisted reproductive technology, maternal vitamin supplementation, and parental smoking).We observed no significant associations between any of the assessed characteristics and PBTs overall or OPGs with the exception of birth weight. After controlling for potential confounding variables, we observed a significant positive association between birth weight quartile and OPGs with a HR of 3.32 (95% CI 1.39\u2fff7.94) for the fourth (\u2fe53915.5\u00a0g) compared to the first (\u2fe43020\u00a0g) quartile (p for trend\u00a0=\u00a00.001).Consistent with results for PBTs in the general population, these results suggest that higher birth weights increase OPG risk in individuals with NF1.",

This paper examines the effects of radiation dose and age at exposure on the incidence of brain cancer using data from the Life Span Study (LSS) of atomic bomb survivors.The Radiation Effects Research Foundation website provides demographic details of the LSS population, estimated radiation doses at time of bomb in 1945, person years of follow-up and incident cancers from 1958 to 1998. We modelled brain cancer incidence using background-stratified Poisson regression, and compared the excess relative risk (ERR) per Gray (Gy) of brain dose with estimates from follow-up studies of children exposed to diagnostic CT scans.After exposure to atomic bomb radiation at 10 years of age the estimated ERR/Gy was 0.91 (90%CI 0.53, 1.40) compared with 0.07 (90%CI \u22120.27, 0.56) following exposure at age 40. Exposure at 10 years of age led to an estimated excess of 17 brain tumors per 100,000 person year (pyr) Gy by 60 years of age. These LSS estimates are substantially less than estimates based on follow-up of children exposed to CT scans.Estimates of ERR/Gy for brain cancers in the LSS and haemangioma cohorts seem much smaller than estimates of risk for young persons in the early years after exposure to CT-scans. This could be due to reverse causation bias in the CT cohorts, diagnostic error, measurement error with radiation doses, loss of early follow-up in the LSS, or non-linearity of the dose-response curve.",

However, recent US-based studies have suggested a lack of association between obesity and liver cancer among blacks and women.We conducted a nested case-control study within the Multiphasic Health Checkup (MHC) cohort of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) members. Liver cancer was diagnosed using the KPNC Cancer Registry. Detailed self-administered questionnaires and a standardized examination that included measurement of height and weight and a 1-h glucose tolerance test were completed prior to diagnosis of liver cancer for cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0450) and matched controls (4489). Height and weight were utilized to calculate BMI (kg/m2) as a measure of adiposity: underweight (15\u2fff\u2fe48.5\u00a0kg/m2), normal weight (18.5\u2fff\u2fe425\u00a0kg/m2), overweight (25\u2fff\u2fe430\u00a0kg/m2), and obese (\u2fe530\u00a0kg/m2). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between BMI, diabetes, and serum glucose with subsequent incidence of liver cancer, in models that were stratified by birth cohort, race/ethnicity, and sex.Compared to normal weight individuals, obese individuals had a 2.4-fold increased risk of liver cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.38, 95% CI: 1.68\u2fff3.36), and overweight individuals had a 32% increased risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.32, 95% CI: 1.03\u2fff1.70).

Unequal access to medical care may be an important factor. Insufficient access to care could delay cancer detection and treatment, which can result in worse survival. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether survival differed between black and white bladder cancer patients in the Department of Defense (DoD), which provides universal healthcare to all beneficiaries regardless of racial background.This study was based on data from the U.S. DoD Automated Central Tumor Registry (ACTUR). White and black patients histologically diagnosed with bladder cancer between 1990 and 2004 were included in the study and followed to the end of 2007. The outcomes were all-cause mortality and recurrence. We assessed the relationship between race and outcomes of interest using Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) for all, non-muscle invasive (NMIBC), and muscle invasive (MIBC) bladder cancers, separately.The survival of black and white individuals did not differ statistically. No significant racial differences in survival (HR: 0.96, 95% CI: 0.76\u20131.22) or recurrence-free survival (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.69\u20131.30) were observed after adjustment for demographic variables, tumor characteristics, and treatment. Similar findings were observed for NMIBC and MIBC patients, respectively.Black patients were more likely to present with MIBC than white patients. However, white and black patients with bladder cancer were not significantly different in overall and recurrence-free survival regardless of muscle invasion. Our study suggests the importance of equal access to healthcare in reducing racial disparities in bladder cancer survival.",

     "abstract": "Overdiagnosis by mammographic screening is defined as the excess in breast cancer incidence in the presence of screening compared to the incidence in the absence of screening. The latter is often estimated by extrapolating the pre-screening incidence trend. The aim of this theoretical study is to investigate the impact of assumptions in extrapolating the pre-screening incidence trend of invasive breast cancer on the estimated percentage of overdiagnosis.We extracted data on invasive breast cancer incidence and person-years by calendar year (1975\u2fff2009) and 5-year age groups (0\u2fff85 years) from Dutch databases. Different combinations of assumptions for extrapolating the pre-screening period were investigated, such as variations in the type of regression model, end of the pre-screening period, screened age range, post-screening age range and adjustment for a trend in women <45. This resulted in 69,120 estimates of the percentage of overdiagnosis, i.e. excess cancer incidence in the presence of screening as a proportion of the number of screen-detected and interval cancers.Most overdiagnosis percentages are overestimated because of inadequate adjustment for lead time. The overdiagnosis estimates range between \u2fff7.1% and 65.1%, with a median of 33.6%. The choice of pre-screening period has the largest influence on the estimated percentage of overdiagnosis: the median estimate is 17.1% for extrapolations using 1975\u2fff1986 as the pre-screening period and 44.7% for extrapolations using 1975\u2fff1988 as the pre-screening period.The results of this theoretical study most likely cover the true overdiagnosis estimate, which is unknown, and may not necessarily represent the median overdiagnosis estimate. This study shows that overdiagnosis estimates heavily depend on the assumptions made in extrapolating the incidence in the pre-screening period, especially on the choice of the pre-screening period. These limitations should be acknowledged when adopting this approach to estimate overdiagnosis.",

     "abstract": "Providing accurate predictions of long-term net survival for recently diagnosed cancer patients is challenging due to the lack of follow-up. The aim of this study was to empirically compare predictions of net survival obtained from a flexible parametric excess hazard model to predictions obtained using the period and hybrid approaches.The Cancer Registry of Norway was used to identify patients diagnosed with cancer during the period 1953\u2fff2008. Patients were then followed up for survival until the end of 2013. Net survival was calculated for 23 different cancer sites at 5, 10 and 15 years after diagnosis for each patient cohort. Observed net survival was estimated using the PP estimator. Predicted net survival was obtained omitting the most recent follow-up years using three approaches: a flexible parametric excess hazard model (FPM), the period approach, and the hybrid approach. All estimates were age-standardized to the age distribution of the cohort for which predictions were made. Prediction errors were calculated as the absolute difference between observed and predicted net survival.Average absolute prediction error across all cancer sites was smallest for FPM for 5-year, 10-year and 15-year net survival. FPM and the hybrid approach gave better predictions of 10- and 15-year net survival than the period approach. The period and hybrid approaches tended to over-estimate net survival for cancer sites with poor survival, and under-estimate net survival for cancer sites where survival has increased over time. Uncertainty in the predictions was considerably smaller when FPM was used compared to the other approaches.FPM should be considered for predicting net survival when follow-up is incomplete.",

     "abstract": "Stomach cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide, despite its incidence and mortality falling in many places. The discovery in 1984 that a bacterial infection with Helicobacter pylori could cause stomach and duodenal ulcers prompted work in its role in causing gastritis, and led to the first prospective study in 1991 by Forman et al., showing that infection with H.pylori increased the risk of stomach cancer in those infected by almost three-fold. Prior to then, it was hypothesized that stomach was caused by poor diets. While diets may still play a role, the falls in stomach cancer incidence have been associated with reductions in population prevalence of H. pylori. Discovery of the link was accelerated by the use of stored sera from other unrelated studies, and the use of serological assays.Since those discoveries the treatment landscape of gastric disorders has changed significantly, with a rapid uptake of antibiotic and proton pump inhibitors (triple) therapies in those who are H. pylori positive. Over time we have seen falls in gastric cancer, peptic and duodenal ulcers and in many of the procedures previously used to cure peptic ulcer disease, such as vagotomies and gastrectomies.Further still, an oral vaccine against H. pylori, first trialled in China, holds much promise of being the third vaccine against a cancer causing infection. If successful this would lead to a further reduction in H. pylori related conditions, and ultimately gastric cancer, an otherwise lethal disease.",

     "abstract": "In view of the growing global obesity epidemic, this paper reviews the relation between recent trends in body mass index (BMI) and the changing profile of cancer worldwide. By examining seven selected countries, each representing a world region, a pattern of increasing BMI with region and gender-specific diversity is noted: increasing levels of BMI were most pronounced in the Middle East (Saudi Arabia), rather modest in Eastern Asia (India) and generally more rapid in females than in males. This observation translates into a disproportionate distribution of cancer attributable to high levels of BMI, ranging by sex from 4\u20139% in Saudi Arabia and from 0.2\u20131.2% in India. Overweight and obesity may also influence cancer outcomes, and hence have a varying impact on cancer survival and death in different world regions. Future challenges in cancer studies exploring the association with overweight and obesity concern the measurement of adiposity and its potentially cumulative effect over the life course. Given the limitations of BMI as an imperfect measure of body fatness, routine anthropometric data collection needs to be extended to develop more informative measures, such as waist circumference in settings where the gold standard tools remain unaffordable. Furthermore, questions surrounding the dose-response and timing of obesity and their associations with cancer remain to be answered. Improved surveillance of health risk factors including obesity as well as the scale and profile of cancer in every country of the world is urgently needed. This will enable the design of cost-effective actions to curb the growing burden of cancer related to excess body weight.",

In contrast, the incidence of oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma has decreased in these same populations. Epidemiological studies conducted over the past decade have provided great insights into the etiology of oesophageal cancer. These studies have identified gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, obesity and cigarette smoking as risk factors for oesophageal adenocarcinoma, while use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and infection with Helicobacter pylori are associated with reduced risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. For oesophageal squamous-cell carcinoma, alcohol and cigarette smoking are the two major risk factors underlying most cases. This review combines a synthesis of these studies with an analysis of data from the United States National Cancer Institute\u2019s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program to discuss the change in incidence of oesophageal cancer and summarize current knowledge of risk factors.",

We sought to describe breast cancer trends in Mexico using population-based data from a national database and to analyze geographical and age-related differences in incidence and mortality rates.All incident breast cancer cases reported to the National Epidemiological Surveillance System and all breast cancer deaths registered by the National Institute of Statistics and Geography in Mexico from 2001 to 2011 were included. Incidence and mortality rates were calculated for each age group and for 3 geographic regions of the country. Joinpoint regression analysis was performed to examine trends in BC incidence and mortality. We estimated annual percentage change (APC) using weighted least squares log-linear regression.We found an increase in the reported national incidence, with an APC of 5.9% (95% CI 4.1\u20137.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

This study was undertaken to quantify the impact of partner status on survival due to cancer-specific and competing mortality causes.Data were obtained from the population-based Queensland Cancer Registry on 176,050 incident cases of ten leading cancers diagnosed in Queensland (Australia) from 1996 to 2012. Flexible parametric competing-risks models were used to estimate cause-specific hazards and cumulative probabilities of death, adjusting for age, stage (breast, colorectal and melanoma only) and stratifying by sex.Both unpartnered males and females had higher total cumulative probability of death than their partnered counterparts for each site. For example, the survival disadvantage for unpartnered males ranged from 3% to 30% with higher mortality burden from both the primary cancer and competing mortality causes. The cause-specific age-adjusted hazard ratios were also consistent with patients without a partner having increased mortality risk although the specific effect varied by site, sex and cause of death. For all combined sites, unpartnered males had a 46%, 18% and 44% higher risk of cancer-specific, other cancer and non-cancer mortality respectively with similar patterns for females. The higher mortality risk persisted after adjustment for stage.It is important to better understand the mechanisms by which having a partner is beneficial following a cancer diagnosis, so that this can inform improvements in cancer management for all people with cancer.",

     "abstract": "Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people (referred to in this paper as \u201cAboriginal people\u201d) generally have lower cancer survivals and more advanced stages at diagnosis than non-Aboriginal people. There is conflicting evidence on whether these disparities vary by socio-economic disadvantage and geographic remoteness. This study examines variations in these disparities in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.Data for cancers diagnosed in 2000\u20132008 were extracted from the NSW Cancer Registry (n\u00a0=\u00a0264,219). Missing Aboriginal status (13.3%) was multiply imputed. Logistic regression and competing risk regression models were used to examine likelihood of advanced summary stage and risk of cancer death among Aboriginal compared with non-Aboriginal people by socio-economic disadvantage (categorised into quintiles 1: least disadvantaged\u20145: most disadvantaged) and remoteness.Aboriginal people showed a general pattern of more advanced stage at diagnosis compared with non-Aboriginal people across socio-economic disadvantage and remoteness categories. After adjusting for demographic factors, year of diagnosis, summary stage and cancer site, Aboriginal people living outside the least disadvantaged areas had an increased risk of cancer death compared with non-Aboriginal people living in similar areas (sub-hazard ratio SHR 1.41, 95% confidence interval CI 1.09\u20131.81; SHR 1.59, 95%CI 1.31\u20131.93; SHR 1.42, 95%CI 1.22\u20131.64 and SHR 1.34, 95%CI 1.22\u20131.48 for quintiles 2\u20135, respectively). Compared with non-Aboriginal people, Aboriginal people had an elevation in the risk of cancer death irrespective of the remoteness, with the most pronounced elevations detected in remote/very remote areas (SHR 1.56, 95%CI 1.10\u20132.21).Compared with non-Aboriginal people, Aboriginal people had a higher risk of cancer death and higher likelihood of more advanced stage across socio-economic disadvantage and remoteness categories.

Smokers, and those with a history of polyps, were also more receptive to initiating daily, low-dose aspirin use. Five psychosocial factors were related to intention including self-efficacy, response efficacy, perceived barriers, perceived susceptibility to colorectal cancer, and cancer information overload.Initial campaigns/interventions designed to increase daily, low-dose aspirin for colorectal cancer prevention may be more effective if they target receptive populations (older, Black males) using messages informed by the health belief model.",

Accurate screening estimates are needed.To estimate the percentage of women in a geographic population that has had cervical cancer screening.We analyzed claims data for (Papanicolau) Pap tests from 2008\u20132012 to estimate the percentage of insured women aged 18\u201339 years screened. We estimated screening in uninsured women by dividing the percentage of insured Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey respondents reporting previous-year testing by the percentage of uninsured respondents reporting previous-year testing, and multiplying this ratio by claims-based estimates of insured women with previous-year screening. We calculated a simple weighted average of the two estimates to estimate overall screening percentage. We estimated credible intervals using Monte-Carlo simulations.During 2008\u20132012, an annual average of 29.6% of women aged 18\u201339 years were screened. Screening increased from 2008 to 2009 in all age groups. During 2009\u20132012, the screening percentages decreased for all groups, but declined most in women aged 18\u201320 years, from 21.5% to 5.4%. Within age groups, compared to 2009, credible intervals did not overlap during 2011 (except age group 21\u201329 years) and 2012, and credible intervals in the 18\u201320 year group did not overlap with older groups in any year.This introduces a novel method to estimate population-level cervical cancer screening.

We also collected data on incident cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) from the Georgia Comprehensive Cancer Registry (GCCR) for the years 1999\u20132008. We constructed distance-decay surrogate exposure metrics and Poisson and negative binomial regression models of NHL incidence to quantify associations between passive exposure to benzene and NHL risk and examined the impact of amount, duration of exposure, and lag time on cancer development. Akaike\u2019s information criteria (AIC) were used to determine the scaling factors for benzene dispersion and exposure periods that best predicted NHL risk.Using a range of scaling factors and exposure periods, we found that increased levels of passive benzene exposure were associated with higher risk of NHL. The best fitting model, with a scaling factor of 4 kilometers (km) and exposure period of 1989\u20131993, showed that higher exposure levels were associated with increased NHL risk (Level 4 (1.1\u2013160\u00a0kilograms (kg)) vs. Level 1: risk ratio 1.56 [1.44\u20131.68], Level 5 (>160\u00a0kg) vs. Level 1: 1.60 [1.48\u20131.74]).Higher levels of passive benzene exposure are associated with increased NHL risk across various lag periods.

Despite advancements in surgery and chemotherapy treatment strategies, the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients remains poor; a majority of patients relapse and eventually succumb to this disease. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcome are urgently needed. The hedgehog signaling pathway is vital for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis, and its deregulation is implicated in cancer cell growth, survival, differentiation, and metastasis. The critical role of hedgehog signaling in multiple biologic processes raises concerns about its potential therapeutic use in cancer. Consequently, many studies are focusing on hedgehog signaling as an attractive target in cancer treatment. In this review, we present an overview of the hedgehog pathway and its pathological aberrations in ovarian cancer. We also discuss inhibitors of the hedgehog signaling pathway that are currently being investigated in the laboratory and in early clinical trials; as well as the clinical challenges these inhibitors face.",

Cancer was mentioned in 12.4% of all death certificates and outweighed mortality from certain infectious and parasitic diseases (3.6%). Cause of death was ill-defined in 19.6% of all death certificates, especially in remote regions and among the elderly. The part of cancer located in the uterus (47.8%) or cell type of neoplasm of the lymphatic or hematopoietic system (73.1%) were often not specified. The uterus (mainly the cervix) (C53\u2013C55) was the leading cancer site in women with AMRWs of 17.2/100,000 in central and 14.0/100,000 in remote districts, followed by the breast. Lung and prostate were the leading cancer sites among men. The lung cancer mortality rate was 19.3/100,000 in the central region but 9.5/100,000 in remote districts. Although children comprised 36% of the population, only 24 death certificates listed cancer as cause of death in this decade.Analysis of cancer mortality in this rural region of Paraguay, which lacks resources for diagnostics and care, revealed an already large number of cases, with higher rates in the central region than in remote districts. Lung and uterus (primarily the cervix) are common cancer sites and indicate the potential for prevention. However, the quality of the vital statistics needs to be improved. The true cancer burden is most likely underestimated, especially in remote regions and children.",

We provided incidence, mortality, and prevalence estimates at national and geographical area levels, together with time projections up to the year 2020.We applied the MIAMOD method, using as input national mortality data for the years 1970\u20132010 and population-based survival data for the period of diagnosis (1985\u20132002). We assumed relative survival of prostate cancer remained constant after the year of diagnosis (2005).The age-standardized incidence rates of PC were estimated to increase during the period 1984\u20132005, from 31 per 100,000 in 1984 to 93 per 100,000 in 2005. From 2005 onwards, the estimated rates declined to 71 in 2015 and to 62 in 2020. Age-standardized mortality rates slightly increased from 1970 up to about 19 per 100,000 in 1999 and then started to decrease with an estimated reduction of about 2.3% per year. Mortality projections indicated a continuing reduction, with a predicted age-standardized rate of about 12 per 100,000 in 2020. Prevalence was estimated to continuously increase up to a crude prevalence value of 1.2% in the year 2020.The results indicate that the epidemic peak of PC was reached around the year 2005 followed by declining incidence rates, while a substantial decrease in mortality, starting during the early 2000s, is expected to continue during the 2010s.",

We included all individuals, aged \u226530 years, residing in Sweden between 1993 and 2010. Socioeconomic position was indicated by (1) highest educational level (five groups), and (2) disposable income (quintiles). We used Poisson regression to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of colon and rectal cancer, and colon and rectal dysplasia.In total, 97,827,817 person-years were accumulated and 82,686 cases of colorectal cancer were diagnosed.

Perinatal and childhood-related characteristics were directly surveyed by trained staff. The association with BC risk, globally and according to menopausal status and pathologic subtypes, was evaluated using logistic and multinomial regression models, adjusting for tumor specific risk factors.Birth characteristics were not related with BC risk.

Finding new modifiable prognostic factors paves the way for additional treatments, which is crucial in advanced cancer, particularly pancreatic cancer. This study examined the relationship between vagal nerve activity, indexed by heart rate variability (HRV), and overall survival (OS) in patients (N\u00a0=\u00a0272) with advanced pancreatic cancer. A \u201chistorical prospective\u201d design was employed, where vagal activity and other confounders were retroactively obtained from medical charts at diagnosis, and subsequent OS was examined. HRV was obtained from 10\u00a0sec ECGs near diagnosis. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured as an inflammatory marker. OS and survival date were obtained from medical charts and the Belgian national registry. Patients with high HRV (>20\u00a0msec) survived on average more than double the days (133.5) than those with low HRV (64.0). In a multivariate cox regression, higher initial HRV was significantly correlated with lower risk of death, independent of confounders including age and cancer treatments. This relationship was statistically mediated (accounted for) by CRP levels. Importantly, in patients who lived up to one month from diagnosis only, HRV was unrelated to CRP, while in patients surviving longer, HRV was significantly inversely related to CRP (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.20, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These results are in line with possible vagal nerve protection in a fatal cancer, and propose that the mechanism may involve neuroimmuno-modulation. Future studies must test whether vagal nerve activation may help patients with advanced cancers.",

Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for odds of distant summary stage at diagnosis.A higher likelihood of being diagnosed with distant cancer was detected for those living in the most socio-economically disadvantaged areas compared with the least disadvantaged areas (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.24\u20131.30) and for those born in other English and non-English speaking countries compared with Australian-born (OR 1.10, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.12 and OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.10\u20131.14, respectively) after adjusting for age, sex, diagnostic period, remoteness, socio-economic status and country of birth.

Odds of distant stage increased over time for those living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas. In cancer site-specific analyses, living in socio-economically disadvantaged areas was generally a stronger predictor of distant stage than remoteness or country of birth.Our results highlight the importance of lower socio-economic status as a predictor of distant stage at diagnosis.

The utilization of the approach-oriented coping strategy (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.85, 95% CI: 0.72\u20130.99) and a behavior of positive reappraisal (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.84, 95% CI: 0.72\u20130.97) was associated with a reduced risk of cancer mortality. The approach-oriented coping strategy was further associated with localized cancer incidence (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.13, 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.27) and screening-detected cancers (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.35, 95% CI: 1.15\u20131.58). The avoidance oriented coping strategy was inversely associated with cancer incidence (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.69, 95% CI: 0.50\u20130.94) only after excluding events occurring in the first three years of follow-up.The results of this study may favor the behavioral hypothesis to explain associations between premorbid coping styles and cancer outcomes.",

     "abstract": "Overweight and obesity are known risk factors for a number of cancers, with recent evidence suggesting that risk of hematologic cancer is also increased in obese individuals. We evaluated associations between body mass index (BMI) at differing time points during the life course in population-based case control studies of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplatic syndromes (MDS).Cases were identified by the Minnesota Cancer Surveillance System. Controls were identified through the Minnesota State driver\u2019s license/identification card list. BMI was calculated using self-reported height and weight at ages 18, 35, and 50 years and two years prior to interview, and categorized as normal (18.5\u201325\u00a0kg/m2), overweight (25\u201329.9\u00a0kg/m2), obese class I (30\u201334.9\u00a0kg/m2), and obese class II/III (35+ kg/m2). All analyses were stratified by sex. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.We included 420 AML cases, 265 MDS cases and 1388 controls. Obesity two years prior to diagnosis was associated with AML in both males and females (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.22, 95% CI 1.28, 3.85 and OR\u00a0=\u00a01.85, 95% CI 1.08, 3.15 for BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a035 vs. BMI 18.5\u201324.9, respectively). In contrast, associations between obesity and MDS were observed only in females. Weight change in adulthood was not consistently associated with either outcome.Our results extend the emerging literature suggesting that obesity is a risk factor for hematologic malignancy and provide evidence that that the association remains regardless of timing of obesity. Obesity in adulthood is a modifiable risk factor for both MDS and AML.",

The population-based epidemiology of MD has revealed genetic, lifestyle and societal/environmental determinants, but studies have largely been conducted in women with similar westernized lifestyles living in countries with high breast cancer incidence rates. To benefit from the heterogeneity in risk factors and their combinations worldwide, we created an International Consortium on Mammographic Density (ICMD) to pool individual-level epidemiological and MD data from general population studies worldwide. ICMD aims to characterize determinants of MD more precisely, and to evaluate whether they are consistent across populations worldwide. We included 11755 women, from 27 studies in 22 countries, on whom individual-level risk factor data were pooled and original mammographic images were re-read for ICMD to obtain standardized comparable MD data. In the present article, we present (i) the rationale for this consortium; (ii) characteristics of the studies and women included; and (iii) study methodology to obtain comparable MD data from original re-read films. We also highlight the risk factor heterogeneity captured by such an effort and, thus, the unique insight the pooled study promises to offer through wider exposure ranges, different confounding structures and enhanced power for sub-group analyses.",

The study included 25,017 patients with a cancer diagnosis and Cbl levels of 200\u2013600\u00a0pmol/L (reference/normal range), 601\u2013800\u00a0pmol/L and >800\u00a0pmol/L measured up to one year prior to diagnosis, and a comparison cohort of 61,988 cancer patients without a plasma Cbl measurement. Patients treated with Cbl were excluded. Survival probability was assessed using Kaplan\u2013Meier curves. Mortality risk ratios (MRR) were computed using Cox proportional hazard regression, adjusted for age, sex, calendar year, cancer stage and comorbidity, scored using the Charlson comorbidity index.Survival probabilities were lower among patients with elevated Cbl levels than among patients with normal levels and among members of the comparison cohort [(1-year survival,%) Cbl: 200\u2013600\u00a0pmol/L: 69.3%; 601\u2013800\u00a0pmol/L: 49.6%; >800\u00a0pmol/L: 35.8%; comparison cohort: 72.6%].

Demographic and historical data were obtained from participants and specimens were self-collected for HPV-testing using real-time PCR. HPV-positive women underwent biopsy and endocervical curettage. Associations were determined using bivariate analysis and logistic regression.HPV and self-reported HIV prevalence were 39.0% and 9.2%, respectively. Eighteen (9.3%) CIN2+ lesions were found among HPV-positive women. Housewives had a higher risk of being HPV infected (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.60, p\u00a0=\u00a00.010).

Principal component analysis was used to calculate a composite score using neighbourhood-level SES variables obtained from the 2006 Canada Census. Associations of SES with overall survival were evaluated in HNC subsets and by p16 status (surrogate for human papillomavirus).SES score was higher for oral cavity (n\u00a0=\u00a0423) and p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer (OPC, n\u00a0=\u00a0404) patients compared with other disease sites. Lower SES was associated with worse survival [HR 1.14 (1.06\u20131.22), p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002], larger tumor staging (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), current smoking (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), heavier alcohol consumption (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and greater comorbidity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0002), but not with treatment regimen (p\u00a0>\u00a00.20).

     "abstract": "In 1974, Valerie Beral published a landmark paper on the sexually transmitted origin of cervical cancer (CC) using statistics routinely available in the United Kingdom (UK). Among women born between 1902 and 1947, CC mortality rates correlated remarkably well with the incidence rates of gonorrhoea when they were 20 years old and both were highest among women born after 1940. Hence, if CC prevention and treatment had remained unchanged, the youngest generations of women would have experienced a high risk of CC death as they grew older. Fortunately, progress in CC prevention has helped avoid this scenario. The adverse consequences of the \u201csexual revolution\u201d were greatly mitigated in the UK and other high-resource countries by the implementation of high quality cytology-based CC screening. An age-period-cohort analysis suggests that >30,000 cases or approximately 35% of expected CC cases may have been prevented by screening programmes in the UK between 1983 and 2007 and this percentage has been steadily increasing. In addition, the discovery of the causal role of HPV is reshaping primary and secondary prevention of CC. Cheaper HPV tests are becoming available and HPV-based primary screening may at last facilitate CC screening in low-resource countries. In the long-term, however, HPV vaccination, which has already been adopted by many countries, represents the best hope for preventing CC and overcoming socio-economic differences in CC risk within and across countries. The additional elucidation of HPV cofactors to which Beral has greatly contributed may also help control HPV infection in unvaccinated women.",

     "abstract": "Malignancies of the upper aero-digestive tract are a major public health problem, especially in the Asia Pacific. Certain Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are well-established risk factors for carcinoma of the uterine cervix and for a subset of head and neck carcinomata: however their true importance in different populations and anatomical subsites remains unclear. The major risk factors in Asia Pacific remain smoked/smokeless tobacco, areca nut, alcohol abuse and poor diet, with limited evidence for HPVs. We review published studies of association of HPV with anatomical site-specific Head & Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) in these populations and attempt a meta-analysis.From MEDLINE/PubMed/WEB-of SCIENCE/EMBASE/Scopus databases we found 67 relevant studies with a total of 7280 cases: 15 case\u2013control studies met our inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, totaling 1106 cases & 638 controls. HPV detection rates, sample site and size, and methods of tissue preservation and HPV detection were tabulated for each study.Studies were heterogeneous in terms of sample selection and method of detection of HPVs. Most were of limited quality. Averaging data from 67 studies of HNSCC, the prevalence of HPV of any subtype is approximately 36%. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was the most used detection method and HPV16 the most common genotype reported. Meta-analyses of case\u2013control studies from this region reveal significant heterogeneity but suggest higher HPV prevalence in oropharyngeal cancer (OR: 14.66; 95%CI: 6.09\u201335.26) compared to oral cavity cancer and laryngeal cancer; (OR: 4.06; 95%CI: 3.05\u20135.39 & OR: 3.23; 95%CI: 1.37\u20137.61) respectively.In view of the significant association of HPV with HNSCC, studies with accurate subsite classification and more sensitive detection methods are necessary. Accurate data from this geographical region are essential to inform public health policies and treatment decisions, especially as studies from Europe and North America reveal HPV-driven cancers to be less aggressive, permitting treatment de-intensification.",

We conducted this meta-analysis to estimate the association between IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio and the risk of colorectal adenomas (CRAs). Further, we investigated whether this association was different between occurrent and recurrent CRA, by adjustment for obesity, and by advanced CRA.Pubmed and Embase were searched up to April, 2015 to identify relevant observational studies and summary odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was estimated using a random-effects model.A total of 12 studies (11 studies including 3038 cases for IGF-1, 12 studies including 3208 cases for IGFBP-3, and 7 studies including 1867 cases for IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio) were included in this meta-analysis. The summary ORs of occurrent CRA for the highest versus lowest category of IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and IGF-1/IGFBP-3 ratio were 1.13 (95% CI: 0.95\u20131.34), 0.99 (0.84\u20131.16), and 1.05 (0.86\u20131.29), respectively.

Transmission of HPV to the upper aerodigestive tract occurs plausibly through sexual contact, although epidemiologic evidence on the role of sexual behaviours in H&NC aetiology is inconsistent.

Summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using fixed and random effects models for each indicator, contrasting \u2018highest\u2019 to \u2018lowest\u2019, \u2018ever\u2019 to \u2018never\u2019, or \u2018youngest\u2019 to \u2018oldest\u2019 categories. Twenty case-control studies were included out of 3838 identified publications.

High maternal coffee consumption was positively associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; OR: 1.43, 95%CI: 1.22-1.68) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML; OR: 2.52, 95%CI: 1.59-3.57). Any or low to moderate maternal cola consumption was also positively associated with overall leukemia (AL) and ALL, A linear trend between coffee and cola consumption and childhood leukemia was observed in the dose-response analyses. On the contrary, low to moderate tea consumption was inversely associated with AL (OR: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.75-0.97), although the trend was non-significant. A null association between offspring's cola consumption and leukemia was noted.Our findings confirm the detrimental association between maternal coffee consumption and childhood leukemia risk and provide indications for a similar role of maternal cola intake. In contrast, an inverse association with tea was found, implying that other micronutrients contained in this beverage could potentially counterbalance the deleterious effects of caffeine. Further research should focus on the intake of specific micronutrients, different types of coffee and tea, specific immunophenotypes of the disease, and the modifying effect of genetic polymorphisms.",

All new cases of CaP were identified and the database was used to assess trends in CaP epidemiology over the study period.3066 new cases of CaP were identified between 1990 and 2009. The world age-standardized rate increased steadily from 71.8 (95% CI 57.8\u201388.4) per 100 000 in 1990 to 112.4 (95% CI 94.0\u2013133.7) per 100,000 in 2009, with a peak rate of 148.9 (95% CI 127.0\u2013172.8) in 2004. The cumulative risk up to 74 years of age also increased from 11.1% in 1990 to 23.8% in 2009 with a peak of 29.9% in 2004. The mean age at diagnosis decreased from 73.1 years in 1990 to a nadir of 66.2 years in 2009. The rate of high-grade cancer (Gleason score \u22658) and intermediate-grade cancer (Gleason score\u00a0=\u00a07) at presentation rose between 2000 and 2009 while the rate of low-grade cancer (Gleason score \u22646) decreased.Barbados suffers an unusually high burden of CaP with a trend towards more aggressive disease over the last decade. The results are important as they highlight the utility of the BUDS initiative in epidemiologic evaluation, but should be looked at cautiously due to a lack of specific details regarding screening practices in this population.",

     "abstract": "In the Latin America countries (LAC), one in five breast cancer (BC) cases occur in women younger than 45 years, almost twice the frequency seen in developed countries. Most BC cases in younger women are premenopausal and are generally more difficult to detect at early stages and to treat than postmenopausal cancers. We employ data from four high quality population-based registries located in LAC and assess the extent to which the higher frequency of BC occurring in younger women is due to a younger population structure, compared to that of developed countries. Next, we analyze secular and generational trends of incidence rates in search for additional explanations.Using data from the International Agency for Research on cancer, between 1988 and 2007, the age distribution of BC incident cases for registries located in Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador is compared to that of USA and Canadian registries, both before and after removing differences in population age structure. An age-period-cohort modelling of incidence rates is also conducted in all compared registries to identify secular and generational effects.BC incident cases in the LAC registries present, on average, at an earlier age than in the USA and Canadian registries and for 2003\u20132007, between 20 and 27% of cases occur in women aged 20\u201344. About two thirds of the difference in age distribution between LAC and USA registries is attributable to the younger age distribution in the LAC base populations. The USA registries show the highest age-specific BC incidence rates of all compared aggregated registries, at all ages. However, in all the LAC registries incidence rates are rapidly increasing, fueled by a strong birth cohort effect. This cohort effect may be explained by important reduction in fertility rates occurring during the second half of the 20th century, but also by a greater exposure to other risk factors for BC related to the adoption of life styles more prevalent in developed countries.The younger age at presentation of BC incident cases seen in the analyzed LAC registries, and possibly in many Latin American countries, is not only attributable to their relatively young population age structure but also to the low incidence rates in older women. As more recently born cohorts, with greater exposure to risk factors for postmenopausal BC, reach older age, incidence rates will be more similar to the rates seen in the USA and Canadian registries. There is a need for additional research to identify determinants of the higher BC rate among younger women in these countries.",

     "abstract": "Dependent children under the age of 18 are particularly vulnerable to the stress of parental death from cancer or of having a parent diagnosed and treated for the disease. More and more Japanese couples are postponing parenthood, which increases their chances of developing cancer while they still have a dependent child. However, the problem has not received enough attention from healthcare professionals and policy-makers because the extent and breadth of the problem has never been examined in the Japanese population. Therefore, we aimed to estimate the nationwide incidence of cancer patients who have children under the age of 18 years, as well as the incidence of children who have a parent diagnosed with cancer in Japan.We calculated the proportion of patients who have children stratified by age, gender and cancer type using electronic medical records of cancer patients (20\u201359 years old) admitted to the National Cancer Center Hospital (NCCH) for the first time between January 2009 and December 2013. We projected these estimates onto the Japanese population using 2010 population-based cancer registry data, and repeated the projection using 2011 hospital-based cancer registry data so that estimates of patients receiving care at Designated Cancer Care (DCC) hospitals could be obtained.We found that an estimated 56,143 cancer patients who have 87,017 dependent children are diagnosed with cancer every year in Japan. The proportion of children in Japan who had a parent newly diagnosed with cancer in 2010 was approximately 0.38%. We estimated that in 2011 there were on average about 82 cancer patients with minor children and 128 minor children who have at least one parent diagnosed with cancer in every DCC hospital in Japan.Parental cancer is common. We have identified that many adults diagnosed with cancer have the double burden of coping with the diagnosis and treatment as well as supporting their children through this experience. Additional data on socioeconomic characteristics and needs assessment of these patients are required to understand how best to help children and families cope with cancer.",

     "abstract": "Little is known about the incidence and survival of anal cancer in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, as anal cancer cases are often grouped together with other colorectal cancers in descriptive epidemiological analyses.We studied patterns and trends in the incidence and survival of people diagnosed with anal cancer in NSW, Australia, 1972\u20132009 (n\u00a0=\u00a02724). We also predicted anal cancer incidence in NSW during 2010\u20132032. Given the human papilloma virus-associated aetiology for most anal cancers, we quantified these changes over time in incidence and survival by histological subtype: anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC); and anal adenocarcinoma (AAC).There was a linear increase in incident anal cancer cases in NSW with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 1.6 (95% CI 1.1\u20132.0) such that, in combination with age-period-cohort modelling, we predict there will be 198 cases of anal cancer in the 2032 calendar year (95% CI 169\u2013236). Almost all of these anal cancer cases are projected to be ASCC (94%). Survival improved over time regardless of histological subtype. However, five-year relative survival was substantially higher for people with ASCC (70% (95% CI 66\u201374%)) compared to AAC (51% (95% CI 43\u201359%)), a 37% difference. Survival was also greater for women (69% (95% CI 64\u201373%)) with ASCC compared to men (55% (95% CI 50\u201360%)). It was not possible to estimate survival by stage at diagnosis particularly given that 8% of all cases were recorded as having distant stage and 22% had missing stage data.Aetiological explanations, namely exposure to oncogenic types of human papillomavirus, along with demographic changes most likely explain the actual and projected increase in ASCC case numbers. Survival differences by gender and histological subtype point to areas where further research is warranted to improve treatment and outcomes for all anal cancer patients.",

We assessed trends in cancer survival inequalities in New Zealand by ethnic and income group. 126,477 people diagnosed with cancer between 1991 and 2004, followed-up to 2006, were included. First, inequalities pooled over time were measured with excess mortality rate ratios (EMRRs). Second, interpretation of changes in inequalities over time can differ depending on whether one uses EMRRs, excess mortality rate differences (EMRD) or absolute differences in relative survival risks (RSRD); we estimated all three by cancer-site and (for EMRRs only) pooled across all sites. We found that pooled over time and all sites, M\u0101ori had an EMRR of 1.29 (95% CI, 1.24\u20131.34) compared to non-M\u0101ori. The low compared to high-income EMRR was 1.12 (95% CI, 1.09\u20131.15). Pooled over cancers, there was no change in the ethnic EMRR over time but the income EMRR increased by 9% per decade (1\u201317%). Changes over time in site-specific inequalities were imprecisely measured, but the direction of change was usually consistent across EMRRs, EMRDs and RSRDs. There were persistent ethnic inequalities in cancer survival over time, and slower improvements for low-income people.",

HCM can be observed with any type of tumor and occurs most commonly in lung cancer, breast cancer and multiple myeloma. While HCM is a potentially fatal condition, the prevalence of HCM is not well defined.Using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we identified adult cancer patients with recorded corrected serum calcium (CSC). Hypercalcemic patients (CSC \u226510.8\u00a0mg/dL) were classified into 4 CSC levels. We estimated annual prevalence of HCM overall, stratified by cancer type, and in patients with stage IV cancer.Among 37,442 cancer patients in 2003\u20132012 the prevalence of grade 1 HCM increased from 0.13% to 0.45% and the prevalence of HCM overall (grade 1 or higher) increased from 0.20% to 0.67% over the study period. Prevalence estimates varied across cancer type and were highest for lung cancer, multiple myeloma and patients with stage IV cancer.We provide the first systematic analysis using a UK population-based data source to estimate number of cancer patients affected with HCM by grade. The increase in HCM prevalence over the 10-year study period is likely due to the increased recording of laboratory values, particularly comparing more recent data to 2003. Our findings suggest that HCM in general is not a common condition.",

This study aims to examine changes in temporal trends in major cancer mortality.Mortality data for 1993\u20132012 were obtained from the Korean Statistics Information Service(KOSIS) database and age-standardized to the 2000 Korean population. Joinpoint analysis was used to identify significant changes in trends over time. The annual percentage rate change (APC) was computed for each segment of the trends.The age-standardized mortality rates (ASR) for all cancer sites combined decreased by 9.1% and 1.1% in men and women, respectively, from 1983 to 2012. ASRs from cancers of esophagus, stomach, and liver decreased substantially, whereas ASRs from cancer for all other sites increased markedly.

     "abstract": "Despite the extensive clinical experience, it is still under debate to what extent patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) benefit from multiple lines of chemotherapy beyond standard first or second line treatment. Selection of patients with MBC who will benefit from treatment is crucial to improve outcome and reduce unnecessary toxicity. In this retrospective study, systemic treatment outcome for patients with metastatic MBC is being evaluated. We evaluated to what extent the clinical benefit of prior chemotherapy can predict the success of a subsequent treatment line.Ninety-one patients treated with chemotherapy for MBC between January 2005 and January 2009 were included in this study. Clinical characteristics of patients, choices of chemotherapy and response at first evaluation of every treatment line was evaluated based on radiologic and clinical data.Patients received multiple systemic cytotoxic and biological (combination) therapies. 30% of these patients received more than five consecutive systemic (combination) treatments. First line chemotherapy was mostly anthracycline-based, followed by taxanes, capecitabine and vinorelbine. The response rate (RR, complete response plus partial response according to RECIST 1.1) decreased from 20% (95% CI 11\u201328%) upon first line of treatment to 0% upon the fourth line. The clinical benefit rate (combining RR and stable disease) decreased from 85% (95% CI 78\u201393%) in the first to 54% (95% CI 26\u201367) upon the fourth line. 24% of the patients with clinical benefit at first evaluation did not receive a subsequent line of treatment when progressive disease occurred, while sixty-one percent of the patients with progressive disease at first evaluation of a treatment did not receive a subsequent line of chemotherapy. When applied, the efficacy of a subsequent line of treatment was similar for patients independent of previous treatment benefit.The clinical benefit at first evaluation from systemic treatment in MBC does not predict for subsequent treatment benefit in this retrospective analysis. The fact that 61% of patients did not receive subsequent treatment after previous treatment failure suggests that either clinical judgement is of critical value in selection of patients to prevent them from unnecessary toxicity or, alternatively indicates that based on the assumption that prior treatment failure predicts for lack of benefit undertreatment of patients occurs. Therefore, a more adequate clinical judgement tool or predictive biomarkers for response are urgently needed to improve treatment outcome.",

Time to death or end of study (31 Dec 2012), duration of therapy and 1 to 5-year relative survival rates stratified by type of initial therapy and age were presented.Of the androgen deprivation therapy initiators (n\u00a0=\u00a03,611, mean age 84), 92% survived 1 year with the relative survival rate decreasing to 79% at 3 years and to 57% at 5 years. Survival outcomes stratified by the type of initial therapy showed slightly higher rates amongst those initiated on gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues or on combined androgen blockage compared to those initiated on anti-androgens. Age specific rates were similar amongst the younger groups (under 80 years old) at each single point of time and were slightly higher than in those aged 80 years and over for some points of time. Fifty percent of patients received androgen deprivation therapy for extended periods (30 months).The 1-year relative survival of veterans was high and similar to that of the general Australian population with prostate cancer. Factors such as tumour stage and grade (not available in the data) could explain differences in survival based on the type of the initial therapy.",

However, oesophageal surgery has high morbidity and in vulnerable patients with co-morbidity other treatment modalities can be proposed. We examined determinants in decision making for surgery and factors affecting survival in patients with resectable oesophageal cancer in southern Netherlands.All patients with resectable (T1-3, N0-1, M0-1A) oesophageal cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0849) diagnosed between 2003 and 2010 were selected from the population-based data of the Eindhoven Cancer Registry. Logistic regression analysis and multivariable Cox survival analysis were conducted to examine determinants of surgery and survival.Forty-five percent of the patients underwent surgery. In multivariable survival analysis only surgery, chemoradiation alone and tumour stage influenced overall survival (OS).Patients aged \u226570 yrs, a low socioeconomic status (SES), one or more co-morbidities, cT1-tumours, cN1-tumours, a squamous-cell carcinoma, and those with a proximal tumour were significantly less often offered surgical resection.Older patients and patients with cT1 tumours were less likely to receive chemoradiation alone. Patients with clinically positive lymph nodes or a proximal tumour were more likely to receive chemoradiation alone.Treatment modalities including surgery and chemoradiation alone as well as stage of disease were independent predictors of a better OS in patients with potentially resectable oesophageal cancer. Therefore, the decision to perform potentially curative treatment is of crucial importance to improve OS for patients with potentially resectable oesophageal cancer. Although age and SES had no significant influence on overall survival, a higher age and low SES negatively influenced the probability to propose potentially curative treatment.",

Numerator data were abstracted from national death files where the cause was malignant neoplasms of trachea, bronchus, and lung (lung cancer) (ICD-9\u00a0=\u00a0162 and ICD-10\u00a0=\u00a0C33\u2013C34). Population-based denominators were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau for 1990, 2000, and 2010. To measure the racial disparity, we calculated non-Hispanic Black:non-Hispanic White rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals for each 5-year period. We calculated correlation coefficients for 12 ecological variables and the RRs.At the final time point (2005\u20132009), 15\u00a0RRs were less than 1, but only 8 significantly so while 29\u00a0RRs were greater than 1, 16 of them significantly so. Of the 45 cities included in the analysis, 21 saw an increase in the Black:White RR between the first and second time points. Measures of socioeconomic status (SES) and inequalities therein were found to be associated with the RRs.This analysis revealed large disparities in Black:White lung cancer mortality in the U.S. and many of its largest cities during the period 1990\u20132009. The data demonstrate considerable variation in the degree of disparity across cities, even among cities within the same state. These data can inform and motivate local health officials to implement targeted prevention and treatment strategies where they are needed most, ultimately contributing to a reduction in the disparity in lung cancer mortality rates.",

Few studies have focused on the combinatorial effect of the GST genes on susceptibility to lung cancer and also for different histological subtypes. Our aim is to investigate the roles of GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 polymorphisms as genetic modifiers of risk for lung cancer and histological subtypes using a larger sample size in a North Indian population.In total 540 subjects (270 lung cancer cases and 270 controls) were evaluated for the GST polymorphism. Genotyping for the GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 gene was done by using a multiplex PCR and PCR-RFLP method.GSTM1 null genotype was found to be associated with lung cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.65, 95%CI: 116\u20132.3, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and this risk was higher in cases of adenocarcinoma (ADCC). GSTT1 and GSTP1 did not show any significant association with lung cancer; however, when stratified for histological subtypes a significant association was observed for ADCC and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) for both GSTT1 null and variant GSTP1 genotypes. The combined \u2018at risk\u2019 genotypes of null GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes were found to be associated with lung cancer risk, and this risk was higher in cases of ADCC (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.09, 95%CI: 110\u201310.2, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). There is a twofold increased risk for lung cancer with the null GSTM1 and wild-type GSTP1 genotypes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004); similarly, a fourfold increased risk was observed with the null GSTT1 and wild-type GSTP1 genotypes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).The deficient GST genotypes seem thus to be important risk modifiers for lung cancer and related histological subtypes, especially in combination.",

It is one of the most aggressive human cancers and the most common cause of cancer-associated limb loss.

Five and ten year overall survival rates were analyzed using time-to-event analysis. Potential prognostic factors were identified by multivariate regression analysis.There were 208 newly diagnosed osteosarcomas during that period, and 144 cases met the criteria for analysis. The majority of the osteosarcoma cases (78.5%) were aged 0\u201324 years. The overall 5- and 10-year survival rates were 37.9% and 33.6%, respectively. Presence of metastasis at initial examination, delayed and against treatment co-operation, and axial skeletal location were identified as independent prognostic factors for survival, with hazard ratios of 4.3, 2.5 and 3.8, and 3.1, respectively.This osteosarcoma cohort had a relatively poor overall survival rate. The prognostic factors identified would play a critical role in modifying survival rates of osteosarcoma patients; as rapid disease recognition, a better treatment counselling, as well as improving of chemotherapeutic regimens were found to be important in improving the overall survival rate in Thailand.",

In this study we investigated the association between HOTAIR polymorphisms and BC susceptibility in a population-based case\u2013control study of 502 cases and 504 matched controls in China. Three haplotype tagging SNPs (rs1899663, rs4759314, rs920778) of HOTAIR were genotyped with polymerase chain reaction\u2013restriction fragment-length polymorphism (PCR\u2013RFLP) and created-restriction-site PCR (CRS\u2013RFLP) assays. False-positive report probability (FPRP) was calculated to test for false-positive associations. Interactions between the SNPs and reproductive factors were further evaluated by the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. BC risk reduction was confined to subgroups of age at menarche >14 (OR: 0.42, 95%CI: 0.21, 0.82) and number of pregnancies >2 (OR: 0.65, 95%CI: 0.49, 0.95) for GT\u00a0+\u00a0TT rs1899663, and age at menopause \u226450 (OR: 0.97, 95%CI: 0.84, 0.99) for AG\u00a0+\u00a0GG rs4759314.

Our results were unlikely to be false positives according to FPRP calculation. In conclusion, genetic variant rs920778 in HOTAIR significantly increased the risk of BC, and it may have apparent interaction with reproductive factors in the progression on BC.

It is unclear whether these differences exist amongst women with grade 1 cancer in New Zealand. Therefore, we examined patterns of axillary nodal involvement, recurrent disease and mortality in grade 1 breast cancer in New Zealand women, and whether ethnicity was an important predictor for any of these outcomes.Data was retrieved from the Auckland Breast Cancer Registry (ABCR) and the Waikato Breast Cancer Registry (WBCR) which are prospective, population-based databases. All women newly diagnosed with grade 1 primary invasive breast cancer between 1 June 2000 and 31 May 2013 were identified from the two registries.There were 2857 grade 1 breast cancers diagnosed over this time period. Axillary lymph nodes were involved in 19.0% of women, and 5.1% developed recurrent disease (locoregional or distant). Pacific and M\u0101ori women were more likely than NZ European women to have larger tumours and lymphovascular invasion (LVI). Predictors for axillary node involvement were tumour size greater than 10\u00a0mm, LVI and non-screen detected cancers. Tumour size greater than 10\u00a0mm, lobular carcinoma and BCS without radiotherapy were predictive of recurrent and or metastatic disease. Ethnicity was not observed to be an independent predictor for axillary nodal involvement, recurrent and/or metastatic disease, or breast cancer specific mortality amongst New Zealand women with grade 1 breast cancer.Ethnicity was not a predictor of axillary node involvement, recurrent disease or mortality in grade 1 breast cancer in our population.",

Conditional logistic regression was used to assess HL risk associated with number of older and younger siblings of mothers.Having a mother with more than two older siblings is associated with lower HL risk, and the association is statistically significant for mothers with three or more siblings, compared with none.

There is no association between number of mothers\u2019 younger siblings and HL risk.Exposures during the childhood of mothers may influence young onset adult HL risk in offspring, perhaps through vertical transmission of infectious agents, or through other long-term influences on maternal immune function.",

     "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated conditional survival (probability of surviving y years given patients have already survived x years) for pediatric/adolescent patients diagnosed with cancer. To provide more accurate information on ongoing survival, we evaluate conditional survival for pediatric and adolescent patients with cancer.The statewide Utah Cancer Registry identified 3344 patients born in Utah diagnosed with cancer at ages 0\u201321 years, from 1973 to 2009. The Utah Population Database provided demographic information. We estimated five-year conditional survival at diagnosis, and one and three years after diagnosis, by risk factors such as cancer type, sex, diagnosis age and treatment era (1973\u20131994 vs. 1995\u20132009).Conditional survival estimates at one (85.1%, 95% CI: 83.7\u201386.5) and three years (92.9%, 95% CI: 91.8\u201393.9) after diagnosis were significantly higher than survival at diagnosis (77.2%, 95% CI: 75.6\u201378.9), although results varied by cancer type and initial prognosis. Diagnosis age affected survival for cancers where age is a risk factor. For example, five-year survival at one year after diagnosis was higher for younger (\u226418 months of age) patients compared to older (>18 months) patients with neuroblastoma (95.4%, 95% CI: 90.9\u201399.9 vs. 56.8%, 95% CI: 41.8\u201371.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Conditional survival improved over time for many cancers. Minimal differences were observed by sex.Substantial improvements were observed in conditional survival at one and three years after diagnosis compared with survival at diagnosis. Several risk factors affected these outcomes. Clearer understandings of survival will help in administering effective survivorship care and decreasing prognosis-related anxiety/stress for patients and families.",

With comprehensive data on pigment characteristics, lifestyle factors, and melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene sequence, we sought to clarify the role of family history of skin cancer in early-onset basal cell carcinoma (BCC).Early onset BCC cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0376) and controls with benign skin conditions (n\u00a0=\u00a0383) under age 40 were identified through Yale dermatopathology. Self-report data on family history of skin cancer (melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer), including age of onset in relatives, was available from a structured interview. Participants also provided saliva samples for sequencing of MC1R.A family history of skin cancer was associated with an increased risk of early-onset BCC (OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.80\u20133.45). In multivariate models, family history remained a strong risk factor for early-onset BCC after adjustment for pigment characteristics, UV exposure, and MC1R genotype (OR 2.41, 95% CI 1.74\u20133.35).Risk for BCC varied based upon the type and age of onset of skin cancer among affected relatives; individuals with a first-degree relative diagnosed with skin cancer prior to age 50 were at highest risk for BCC (OR 4.79, 95% CI 2.90\u20137.90). Even after taking into account potential confounding effects of MC1R genotype and various lifestyle factors that close relatives may share, family history of skin cancer remained strongly associated with early-onset BCC.",

     "abstract": "An increased risk of adult myeloid leukemia (AML) has recently been associated with lifestyle and environmental exposures, including obesity, smoking, some over the counter medications, and rural/farm habitats in case control studies. The association of these exposures with AML cytogenetic categories, outcomes after therapy, and overall survival is unknown.Relevant exposures were evaluated in a cohort of 295 consecutive AML patients diagnosed and treated at Mayo Clinic in Florida and Arizona. Standard cytogenetic risk categories were applied and reviewed in a central cytogenetic laboratory. The association of epidemiologic exposures with cytogenetic risk, complete remission after therapy, and overall survival was evaluated using logistic and Cox regression models.A significant association between obesity and intermediate-abnormal cytogenetics was identified (OR: 1.94, P\u00a0=\u00a00.025). Similarly, those with secondary AML were more likely to have poor risk (OR: 2.55, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and less likely to have intermediate normal (OR: 0.48, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) cytogenetics.

Furthermore, an association between statin use at the time of diagnosis (OR: 2.89, P\u00a0=\u00a00.016) and increased complete remission after intensive chemotherapy was identified, while prior solid organ transplantation was associated with significantly lower complete remission rate after therapy (OR: 0.10, P\u00a0=\u00a00.035).Our results provide evidence that specific epidemiologic exposures, including obesity, are significantly associated with unique AML cytogenetic risk categories and response to therapy.

Timeliness of care is an important dimension of cancer care quality but its impact on prognosis remains to be explored. This study evaluates the variations in guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care and prognosis among elderly in the US.Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (2002\u20132007), we identified elderly patients with lung cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a048,850) and determined time to diagnosis and treatment. We categorized patients by receipt of timely care using guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and the RAND Corporation. Hierarchical generalized logistic model was constructed to identify variables associated with receipt of timely care. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis and Log Rank test was used for estimation and comparison of the three-year survival. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to estimate lung cancer mortality risk associated with receipt of delayed care.Time to diagnosis and treatment varied significantly among the elderly. However, majority of them (77.5%) received guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care. The likelihood of receiving timely care significantly decreased with NSCLC disease, early stage diagnosis, increasing age, non-white race, higher comorbidity score, and lower income. Paradoxically, survival outcomes were significantly worse among patients receiving timely care. Adjusted lung cancer mortality risk was also significantly lower among patients receiving delayed care, relative to those receiving timely care (Hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a00.68, 95% Confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a0(0.66\u20130.71); p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).This study highlights the critical need to address disparities in receipt of guideline-concordant timely lung cancer care among elderly. Although timely care was not associated with better prognosis in this study, any delays in diagnosis and treatment should be avoided, as it may increase the risk of disease progression and psychological stress in patients. Furthermore, given that lung cancer diagnostic and management services are covered under the Medicare program, observed delays in care among Medicare beneficiaries is also a cause for concern.",

Increased attention has been given to understanding the role of local contexts on cancer screening behaviors. We examined the associations between multiple tract-level socioeconomic measures and adherence to colorectal cancer screening (CRCS) in Harris County and the City of Houston, Texas.We conducted a cross-sectional multilevel study linking individual-level data on CRCS from the 2010 Health of Houston Survey with contextual data from the U.S. Census and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. We examined tract-level poverty, education, employment, income inequality, and foreclosure measures across 543 Census tracts. Analyses were limited to individuals aged 50\u201374 years (N\u00a0=\u00a01720).Overall, 58.0% of the sample was adherent to any recommended CRCS test. In bivariate analyses, increasing levels of area poverty, low education, unemployment, and foreclosures were associated with lower odds of adherence to CRCS. After controlling for individual-level covariates, only tract-level unemployment remained associated with adherence to CRCS (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.80; 95% CI: 0.66\u20130.99; P\u00a0=\u00a0.037).Neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage is increasingly recognized as a determinant of health, and our study suggests that the contextual effect of area unemployment may extend to cancer screening outcomes. Our finding is important to cancer control planners because we identified a contextual marker of disparity that can be used to target local interventions to promote CRCS and thereby reduce cancer disparities among non-adherent individuals who reside in communities with high unemployment rates.",

During median follow-up time 13.5 years and 633,342 person-years overall 665 invasive cancer and 87 ductal carcinoma in situ (11.6%) cases have been identified. Between 1996 and 2004 the detection rates were 239.9 per 100.000 among women aged 40\u201349 years and 543.2 per 100,000 among women aged 50\u201369 years. The rates for interval cancers were 160.4 and 277.4 per 100 000 negative screens, respectively. During median follow-up of 13.5 years 165 deaths occurred with no difference in survival between patients with interval and screen detected cancers.A mammography screening program has been performed between 1989 and 2005 in Vorarlberg. Till 2005 most quality indicators improved and met the EU-recommendations suggesting that alternative approaches to organized mammography screening based on routine data should be explored.",

     "abstract": "In Lebanon, annual national breast awareness campaigns were started in 2002 during the international breast month of October to promote the utilization of mammography for women aged \u226540. The impact of the campaigns has been assessed periodically since 2003. Results of 2003\u20132005 campaigns have been published previously.To measure the prevalence of two behavioral outcomes of interest: ever-use of mammography, and repeat mammography in the previous 12 months among ever-users. The prevalence was described by region and age group. The aim was to document the effectiveness of the program towards reaching a nationally defined goal of 80% screening coverage.The survey\u2019s sampling frame was developed incrementally, and since 2005 it has included women aged \u226540 from all areas of Lebanon. The sample size has also increased incrementally from 1200 in 2005 to 2400 in 2013. Results have been tabulated biannually and presented as historical trends with regional and demographic variations covering a 9-year period.In all six consecutive surveys presented here, the mean age of participating women was about 50 years. Year-by-year increases in utilization indicators were detected, with consistent differences in favor of the more urban areas in and around the capital city Beirut and its suburbs (Greater Beirut or GB). By 2013, ever-utilization had reached 43% (41\u201345) and recent mammography 20% (18\u201322) nationwide. Utilization was significantly more important in the age group 50\u201359 compared with the age group 40\u201349 or \u226560. While recent rates have increased nationwide, they have reached a plateau of about 25% in GB and are tending to the same level in other areas.While initial progress was slow, it has been accelerating in the last 4\u20135 years, indicating that the message is being accepted by a larger audience of targeted women at each iteration. However, concern remains that women between 40 and 50 and those >60 are not responding as well as desired to the screening message, for reasons currently under investigation.",

High cholesterol levels and history of chronic diseases were statistically significantly positively associated with screening participation.Being obese, physically inactive and non-attention to diet are risk factors for CC screening attendance. These findings are of importance for improving the CC screening practices of low-user groups.",

     "abstract": "The anatomic distribution of advanced colorectal neoplasia is increasingly important for choosing screening strategies and treatment options. We sought to evaluate the impact of repeated screening on the positive predictive value (PPV) for advanced colorectal neoplasia (advanced adenoma, AA, and colorectal cancer, CRC) and their distribution according to anatomic subsite distribution in average-risk adults.The study included 98,031 men and women aged 50-74 who had a positive g-FOBT in 2010 and 2011 and underwent total colonoscopy. The PPV for detection of AA and CRC and the relative risks were determined with log-binomial models, and the distribution of anatomic subsites was estimated according to screening history.The median age was 61 years (62 years for participants with AA and 64 for those with CRC). The PPV for detection of advanced neoplasia was 24.5%, substantially higher in men than women (30.7% vs 17.7%), and it increased with age. It also fell at all screening episodes after the first. Subsequent screening episodes were associated with an increased RR for proximal AA (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.16\u20131.20). Advancing age (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.39 for every 10-year increase in age), female gender (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.44), and subsequent screening (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04\u20131.27) were significantly and independently associated with detection of proximal adenocarcinoma. The latter was also detected at an advanced stage more often (RR, 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09\u20131.42). Early stages of invasive adenocarcinoma (stages I and II) was more likely to be detected in a subsequent than an initial screening (RR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.13).This study found that subsequent screening episodes using g-FOBT were associated with an increase in the detection rate of proximal AA and CRC, especially among women. The more frequent detection of proximal invasive adenocarcinoma at an advanced stage in subsequent screenings suggests that some of these tumors may well not be real incident lesions, but are likely to include lesions that were missed on the previous screens. Although modest, the increase in the rate of detection of invasive adenocarcinoma at early (and more curable) stages from the first to subsequent screenings, together with this potential for missed diagnoses on initial screening and the increased detection rate for proximal or rectal AA in subsequent screening episodes, underlines the need to reinforce the population\u2019s awareness of the importance of regular consistent screening, after negative results.",

In prevention and risk communication, it is important to have reliable ways for identifying people with risky sun habits. In this study the validity and reliability of the questionnaire Sun Exposure Protection Index (SEPI), developed to assess individua\u013as sun habits and their propensity to increase sun protection during routine, often brief, clinical encounters, has been evaluated. The aim of our study was to evaluate validity and reliability of the proposed SEPI scoring instrument, in two countries with markedly different ultraviolet radiation environments (Sweden and Australia).Two subpopulations in Sweden and Australia respectively were asked to fill out the SEPI together with the previously evaluated Readiness to Alter Sun Protective Behaviour questionnaire (RASP-B) and the associated Sun-protective Behaviours Questionnaire. To test reliability, the SEPI was again filled out by the subjects one month later.Comparison between SEPI and the questions in the Sun-protective Behaviours Questionnaire, analyzed with Spearman\u2019s Rho, showed good correlations regarding sun habits. Comparison between SEPI and RASP-B regarding propensity to increase sun protection showed concurrently lower SEPI mean scores for action stage, but no difference between precontemplation and contemplation stages. The SEPI test-retest analysis indicated stability over time. Internal consistency of the SEPI, assessed with Cronbach\u2019s alpha estimation showed values marginally lower than the desired >0.70 coefficient value generally recommended, and was somewhat negatively affected by the question on sunscreen use, likely related to the classic \u201csunscreen paradox\u201d. There were some differences in the performance of the SEPI between the Swedish and Australian samples, possibly due to the influence of \u201cavailable\u201d sunlight and differing attitudes to behaviour and protection \u201cat home\u201d and on vacation.SEPI appears to be a stable instrument with an overall acceptable validity and reliability, applicable for use in populations exposed to different UVR environments, in order to evaluate individual sun exposure and protection.",

The compensatory drop method yielded an overdiagnosis estimate of \u22120.1% (95% credibility interval \u22120.5% to 0.5%) when participation rates among the population and risk of cancers were constant. However, if participation rates increased with calendar year as well as risk of cancer with birth cohorts, the overdiagnosis estimated was 11.0% (10.5\u201311.6%). Using the method based on the incidence of early- and late-stage cancers, overdiagnosis estimates were 8.9% (8.5\u20139.3%) and 17.6% (17.4\u201317.9%) when participation rates and risks of cancer were constant or increased with time, respectively.Adjustment for lead time based on the compensatory drop method is accurate only when participation rates and risks of cancer remain constant, whereas the adjustment method based on the incidence of early- and late-stage cancers results in overestimating overdiagnosis regardless of stability of participation rates and breast cancer risk.",

Data on the chemopreventative role of these drugs on the mortality in patients with upper aerodigestive tract cancer (UADT) are insufficient. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of aspirin and other NSAIDs on survival in UADT cancer patients.An observational cohort study of patients with UADT cancer was undertaken using Primary Care Clinical Informatics Unit (PCCIU) database of electronic medical records in Scotland. Information was available on all prescriptions of aspirin and other NSAIDs before and after diagnosis. The main outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Cox regression was used for statistical data analysis.There were 2392 patients diagnosed with UADT cancer between 1996 and 2010. Mean age of patients was 66 years (SD 12) and most were male (63%). Median survival in head and neck (HNC) patients was 94 months, while median survival in oesophageal cancer patients was 10 months. For HNC improved survival was observed with aspirin prescription (ever vs never hazard ratio (HR) 0.56 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.44, 0.71), there was no association with Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors (COX-2) prescriptions. Improved survival was observed with other NSAIDs prescription (ever vs never HR 0.74 95% CI 0.60, 0.90). For oesophageal cancer patients, improved survival was observed with aspirin prescriptions (ever vs never HR 0.54 95% CI 0.45, 0.64), COX-2 prescriptions (HR 0.78 95% CI 0.62, 0.98) and other NSAIDs (HR 0.67 95% CI 0.56, 0.80).Aspirin and other NSAIDs prescriptions after diagnosis are associated with a reduced all-cause mortality in UADT cancer patients.",

As non-invasive diagnostic modalities, e.g. echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging, have become more sensitive, there is a marked increase in the number of patients diagnosed. Nevertheless, most patients die within one year of initial diagnosis, either because of the often asymptomatic presentation of cardiac tumors until advanced disease, or a low index of suspicion on the part of the physician. The presenting symptoms, treatment options and, indeed, prognosis are largely controlled by the tumor's anatomic location. Cardiac sarcomas may present with a variety of symptoms and are known to be great mimickers. A quick diagnosis facilitates the initiation of a proper treatment (surgical resection, adjuvant chemotherapy), which may in turn improve the prognosis. Metastases to the heart are far more common, unfortunately, clinical manifestations are mainly dominated by generalized tumor spread.

The studies focused on a range of different cancers and showed it is feasible to recruit patients to education and screening interventions within a community pharmacy setting. However, the interventions were poorly described in the literature.There is significant potential for community pharmacy to deliver education and screening-based interventions to promote the early detection of cancer, but more evidence is needed to ascertain how interventions delivered in this setting impact on patient outcomes.",

Studies with insufficient data, conducted in experimental models or associated with other comorbidities were excluded from the meta-analysis. Summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) for Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) versus normal, and CIN grade 3 or worse (CIN3+) versus normal, were estimated using the bivariate model.Out of the 20 initially included studies, finally 7 (comprising of 1385 subjects with various stages of CIN and normal cervical pathology) met the inclusion criteria. The sensitivity of CIN2+ versus normal was estimated to be 0.66 (CI 95%, 0.46-0.81) and the specificity 0.92 (CI 95%, 0.88-0.95). On the other hand, the sensitivity of CIN3+ versus normal was 0.77 (CI 95%, 0.58-0.89) and the specificity 0.92 (CI 95%, 0.88-0.94). Moreover, the area under the curve (AUC) in the former case was 0.923, and in the latter 0.931.The results of this meta-analysis support the utility of PAX1 methylation as an auxiliary biomarker in cervical cancer screening.

Crude and age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR) were calculated. Rate ratios of mean crude mortality for selected municipalities were compared to the Brazilian rate. A regression was carried out of the annual number of deaths against asbestos consumption using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The best model was chosen to estimate the future burden and peak period of deaths.There were 929C45 and 1379 C38.4 deaths. The ratio of men to women for C45 was 1.4. A positive trend in C45 numbers was observed in Brazil (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0012), particularly in S\u00e3o Paulo (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) where ASMRs presented an increasing linear trend (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0344). Selected municipalities harboring asbestos manipulation presented 3.7\u201311 fold rate ratios of C45 compared to Brazil. GAM presented best fits for latencies of 34 years or more. It is estimated that the peak incidence of C45 mortality will occur between 2021 and 2026.The observed ASMRs and the gender ratio close to 1 suggest underreporting. Even so, deaths are increasing and mesothelioma clusters were identified.

Patients diagnosed between 10 and 19 years of age were at a higher risk of death compared to those diagnosed before age 10 (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR): 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17\u20131.44). African Americans (1.27, 1.09\u20131.48) and Hispanics (1.15, 1.00\u20131.32) had an elevated risk of mortality than Caucasians. Compared to the subtype acute promyelocytic leukemia, AML with minimal differentiation (2.44, 1.78\u20133.35); acute erythroid leukemia (2.34, 1.60\u20133.40); AML without maturation (1.87, 1.35\u20132.59); and most other AML subtypes had a higher risk of mortality, whereas AML with inv(16) had a substantially lower risk. Age at diagnosis, race-ethnicity, AML subtype, county level poverty and geographic region appeared as significant prognostic factors of pediatric AML survival in the US. Contrary to previous findings, the subtypes of AML with t(9;11)(p22;q23)MLLT3-MLL, AML without maturation and acute myelomonocytic leukemia emerged to be indicative of poor outcome.",

     "abstract": "Despite being a well-documented phenomenon, seasonal variation in the incidence of cutaneous melanoma is poorly understood, and data on the seasonality of melanoma survival are scarce. We sought to explore the seasonal variation in melanoma incidence and survival in Belgium and to assess the characteristics and outcomes of cases diagnosed during the seasonal peak.All cases of invasive cutaneous melanoma\u2014patients over 15 years of age and registered by the Belgian Cancer Registry (BCR) from 2004 to 2009\u2014were included (n\u00a0=\u00a09782). Monthly variations in incidence were estimated by the ratio of the number of cases diagnosed each month to that diagnosed in January (Rmonth/January) using Nam\u2019s method. The observed and relative 5-year survival rates were adjusted on patient and tumour characteristics using Cox proportional hazards regression models and generalised linear models with a Poisson error structure, respectively.A peak in melanoma incidence was observed in June (RJune/January\u00a0=\u00a01.64, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.54\u20131.73). The 5-year observed survival (OS) and relative survival (RS) rates were significantly higher for patients diagnosed in June compared with other months (OSJune\u00a0=\u00a084%, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a081\u201386 versus OSOthermonths\u00a0=\u00a079%, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a078\u201380; RSJune\u00a0=\u00a093%, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a090\u201395 versus RSothermonths\u00a0=\u00a087%, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a086\u201388).

Studies suggest that carotenoid and tocopherol intake may be associated with PrCA risk and progression. We examined plasma carotenoid and tocopherol levels in relation to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels among men with PSA-defined biochemical recurrence of PrCA.Data analyzed were from a 6-month diet, physical activity and stress-reduction intervention trial conducted in South Carolina among biochemically recurrent PrCA patients (n\u00a0=\u00a039). Plasma carotenoids and tocopherol levels were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Linear regression was used to estimate least-square means comparing PSA levels of men with high versus low carotenoid/tocopherol levels, adjusting for covariates.After adjusting for baseline PSA level, plasma cis-lutein/zeaxanthin level at 3 months was related inversely to PSA level at 3 months (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0008), while \u03b1-tocopherol (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), \u03b2-cryptoxanthin (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and all-trans-lycopene (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) levels at 3 months were related inversely to PSA levels at 6-months. Percent increase in \u03b1-tocopherol and trans-\u03b2-carotene levels from baseline to month 3 were associated with lower PSA levels at 3 and 6 months. Percent increase in \u03b2-cryptoxanthin, cis-lutein/zeaxanthin and all-trans-lycopene were associated with lower PSA levels at 6 months only.Certain plasma carotenoids and tocopherols were related inversely to PSA levels at various timepoints, suggesting that greater intake of foods containing these micronutrients might be beneficial to men with PSA-defined PrCA recurrence.",

We evaluated treatment patterns for older veterans with localized PCa, particularly those with low-risk features.We used VA Cancer Registry data to identify men aged 65+ diagnosed with clinically localized PCa between January 1st, 2003 and December 31st, 2008. We obtained baseline data on demographics, tumor characteristics, comorbidities, and initial treatment within 6 months of diagnosis: radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, primary androgen-deprivation therapy (PADT), or no active treatment. National VA surveys provided facility data, including academic affiliation, availability of oncologic specialists, and distance to radiotherapy facilities. Multinomial regression analyses determined associations between patient and facility characteristics and cancer treatment for men with localized (stage\u00a0<\u00a0III) and low-risk PCa (stage\u00a0\u2264\u00a0IIa, PSA\u00a0<10\u00a0ng/mL, Gleason \u22646).17,206 veterans had localized PCa, 32% age 75+, 12% had comorbidity scores \u22653, and 33% had low-risk tumors.

The purpose of this study was to use recent data to examine oral cancer incidence trends and disparities by demographic factors and anatomic location.Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) incidence data from 2000 to 2010 were used to characterize and analyze oral cancer incidence trends by anatomic region and subsite, age at diagnosis, gender, race/ethnicity, and stage at diagnosis. Poisson regression was used to compare incidence risk by select demographic factors.About 75,468 incident oral cancer cases were diagnosed from 2000 to 2010. The tonsil was the most frequently diagnosed anatomic subsite (23.1%) and the subsite with the greatest contribution to the overall, age-standardized cumulative incidence rate of 8.4 cases per 100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI): 8.3, 8.4). An increasing incidence trend was observed for cancers in the oropharyngeal region, in contrast to a decreasing trend seen in the oral cavity region. In the Poisson regression model, all race/ethnicity groups showed a lower incidence risk relative to whites for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer, and white males displayed the highest incidence rate of all race/ethnicity-gender groups during the study period (14.1 per 100,000; 95% CI: 14.0, 14.2).This study's epidemiological findings are especially important for oral health care providers, patient education, and the identification of risk profiles associated with oral cancer. The distinct epidemiological trends of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers dictate that oral cancer can no longer be viewed as a discrete entity. Oral health providers should have a strong understanding of the different risk factors associated with oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers and educate their patients accordingly.",

Compared to other regions, patients who resided in the capital city had a significantly higher survival: 69.6% (65.8; 73.0) versus 63.5% (59.4; 67.4) in Patagonia, 63.2% (61.9; 64.5) in the central region, 58.0% (54.2; 61.7) in Cuyo, 55.6% (52.5; 58.6) in the north-east, and 55.4% (52.4; 58.2) in the north-west (all P values <0.005).Of children diagnosed with cancer in Argentina, 62% survived at least 3 years after diagnosis. Even though this figure is lower than that reported for more developed countries, survival patterns by diagnosis, age and sex were quite similar. Survival was lower in the two northern regions, which are areas with higher poverty levels.",

     "abstract": "Over the past few decades, the incidence of thyroid cancer has dramatically increased in many countries. This increase was mainly seen in papillary cancer. The role of diagnostic practices and the effects of other risk factors were suggested to explain this increase. We provide a descriptive analysis in terms of changes in incidence, geographical distribution, and survival to check the relevance of assumptions about the increase.A detailed analysis of changes in incidence recorded in French cancer registries between 1982 and 2010 was performed taking into account age, period, and birth cohort. The geographical distribution of the incidence in the 2006\u20132010 period was estimated from the standardized incidence ratios. The net survival was estimated to evaluate the effects of sex, age, and period of diagnosis in patients diagnosed between 1989 and 2004 and followed-up until 2013.The incidence of papillary cancer has increased sharply over the 1982\u20132010 period; the average annual rate of increase was 7.8% in men and 7.2% in women. The increase has slowed in the recent period in people aged less than 50 at the time of diagnosis. It has also slowed in the cohorts born 1945 and after. There was a strong geographic disparity in incidence between areas covered by cancer registries. Finally, the net survival was very high; the 10-year net survival was 96% and improved progressively from 82% in patients diagnosed between 1989 and 1993 to 95% in those diagnosed between 1999 and 2004.The increased incidence results most probably from the effect of medical practice, although other risk factors seem also involved, but to a lesser extent. The increase seems to have slowed down in the recent years, especially in the youngest age groups. This observation suggests a recent trend towards saturation of the effects of medical practices in post-1945 cohorts associated with an effect of the gradual dissemination of the recommendations relative to the management of thyroid nodules.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is the leading type of malignancy and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women worldwide. The screening programs and advances in the treatment of patients with breast cancer have led to an increase in overall survival. Cancer registry systems play an important role in providing basic data for research and the monitoring of the cancer status. In this study, the results of the 10-year national cancer registry (NCR) of Iran in breast cancer are reviewed. NCR database records were searched for primary breast cancer records according to ICD-O-3 coding and the cases were reviewed. A total of 52,068 cases were found with the coding of primary breast cancer. Females constituted 97.1% of the cases. Breast cancer was the leading type of cancer in Iranian females, accounting for 24.6% of all cancers. The mean age of the women with breast cancer was 49.6 years (95%CI 49.5\u201349.6). Most of the cases (95.7%) were registered as having invasive pathologies (behavior code 3). The most common morphology of primary breast cancer was invasive ductal carcinoma (ICD-O 8500/3) followed by invasive lobular carcinoma (ICD-O 8520/3) with relative frequencies of 77.8% and 5.2%, respectively. The average annual crude incidence of primary breast cancer in females was 22.6 (95%CI 22.1\u201323.1) per 100,000 females, with an age-standardized rate (ASR) of 27.4 (95%CI 22.5\u201335.9). There were no data on survival, staging or immunohistochemical marker(s) of the breast-cancer-registered cases. The incidence of breast cancer in Iran is lower than in low-middle-income neighboring countries. The NCR data registry of breast cancer is not accurate in monitoring the effect of screening programs or determining the current status of breast cancer in Iran. Screening programs of breast cancer in Iran have failed to enhance the detection of the patients with in situ lesion detection. A quality breast cancer registry and a screening program for breast cancer are both needed.",

Five-year prevalence was calculated by the counting method at five time points (1987, 1992, 1997, 2002, and 2007) for which data were available, then historical prevalence trends (1987\u20132007) were extrapolated into 2008\u20132017.For men, 5-year prevalence of lung cancer in NSW increased slowly in number from 1748 in 1987 to 2151 in 2007, although there was a 15% reduction in prevalence rates over the same time period. For women, there was a greater increase both in number (2.55 times) and rates (88%) between 1987 and 2007. Despite the narrowing gap in lung cancer prevalence between men and women, in 2007 the 5-year prevalence for men was still higher than that for women. However, if the past trends continue, it is expected that in 2017 the 5-year lung cancer prevalence for women in NSW will surpass that for men.Our projections suggest that by 2017 the prevalence of lung cancer for women will be greater than that of men in NSW Australia. Further strengthening the current tobacco control measures should be considered a high priority in Australia, particularly for adolescents and women.",

The associations between OPN and VEGF expression and clinicopathological data were analyzed using chi-square test analysis. Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method.

Here we investigate papillary thyroid cancer risk associated with self-reported living environments across the lifespan reflecting immunologically relevant exposures to microbial-rich environments.Among 61,803 eligible participants in the California Teachers Study cohort, 100 were diagnosed with invasive papillary thyroid cancer between 2005 and 2012. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Living in a rural area during early childhood was associated with significantly reduced risk of developing papillary thyroid cancer as an adult (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.51, 95% CI: 0.28\u20130.94). Specifically, reduced risks were observed for living within a half mile of hoofed animals (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.47, 95% CI: 0.26\u20130.84), as was having an indoor dog or cat (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.51, 95% CI: 0.32\u20130.80). Neither sharing a bedroom or living in a rented home as a child nor attending daycare or kindergarten was associated with reduced risk.Early childhood exposures to hoofed animals or indoor furry pets were associated with reduced risk of subsequently developing papillary thyroid cancer.Our findings point to immunologically relevant, early-life exposures to microbial-rich environments as potentially important in reducing thyroid cancer risk, consistent with the hygiene hypothesis and suggesting that certain, possibly animal-derived, microbial exposures may be important to immune calibration or priming.",

We compared health care consultations, hospitalisations, emergency department visits, and diagnostic procedures in the three months prior and the month of diagnosis for 281 clients registered with a diagnosis of CUP (C809) and 1102 controls randomly selected from clients registered with a first diagnosis of metastatic cancer of known primary.Overall, the median age at cancer diagnosis was 83 years. CUP patients were slightly older and had significantly more comorbidities prior to diagnosis than those with known primary. Compared to known primary, a diagnosis of CUP was significantly more likely after an emergency department visit, less specialist input, fewer invasive diagnostic procedures such as resection or endoscopy, and more non-invasive procedures such as magnetic resonance imaging. There were no differences in primary care or allied health consultations and hospitalisations.This health care pathway suggests delayed recognition of cancer and scope for improvement in the medical management of high-risk individuals presenting to primary care.

Patients with the lowest socioeconomic status had a disproportionate frequency of metastatic disease and large tumors at presentation as compared to more affluent patients.Patients with high-grade osteosarcoma have decreased cause-specific survival at 10 years when metastatic at diagnosis, patient age\u00a0\u2265\u00a060 years, male sex, axial tumor location, and tumors measuring\u00a0\u2265\u00a010\u00a0cm. Patients living in low socioeconomic counties present more frequently with metastatic disease and large tumors.

     "abstract": "Prior work estimating optimal treatment utilisation rates for cervical cancer has focused on radiotherapy or chemotherapy, using proportions of patients with clinical indications for specific treatment strategies which were obtained from the published literature.To estimate optimal uptake rates for surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy for cervical cancer treatment in Australia and Canada, and to quantify the differences in the optimal and the observed treatment utilisation rates in a large cancer facility from each country.A decision tree was constructed to reflect treatments according to guidelines and current practice (in 1999\u20132008) in each setting. Detailed patterns of care data from a large cancer facility in each country were obtained, and the observed stage distribution and proportions of patients with each clinical indication were used as inputs.The estimated overall optimal treatment rates for cervical cancer in Australia and Canada differed, largely due to the difference in the stage distribution at diagnosis in the two settings; 72% vs 54% with FIGO IA-IIA disease, respectively. The estimated optimal rates for surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy in Australia were 63% (95% credible interval: 61\u201364%), 52% (53\u201356%), 36% (35\u201338%) and 36% (35\u201338%), respectively.

The absolute differences between the optimal and the observed rates were similar between the two settings; the absolute differences for chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy uptake were more pronounced (9\u201315% less than optimal) than those for surgery and radiotherapy uptake (within 5% of optimal).This is the first study to use detailed patterns of care data in multiple settings to compare optimal and observed rates for all cervical cancer treatment modalities. We found optimal treatment rates were largely dependent on the overall stage distribution. In Australia and Canada, observed surgery rates, as measured in the two large cancer facilities, were similar to the estimated optimal rates, whereas radiotherapy, chemotherapy and chemo-radiotherapy appeared to be under-utilised.",

Here, we investigated the association between emergency presentation and the odds of undergoing surgical resection and subsequent survival among lung cancer patients undergoing surgical resection as well as those who did not.Details of 93,783 lung cancers were extracted from the National Cancer Data Repository. For non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients we calculated odds ratios for undergoing surgical resection. Survival was assessed for resected NSCLC and for all other lung cancer patients in three different time intervals: short-term, intermediate and long-term.Compared with those who did not, NSCLC patients presenting through an emergency route were less likely to undergo surgical resection (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.22, 95% CI: 0.20\u20130.24). Patients who underwent surgical resection after an emergency presentation had lower survival in the intermediate period (adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a01.27, 95% CI: 1.06\u20131.54) and long term (adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a01.20, 95% CI: 0.99\u20131.45).

The outcome was progression to metastatic disease, identified by metastatic episode notifications in the CCR or by prostate cancer death. Factors associated with metastatic disease progression were identified using Cox regression models.Of the 32,643 men with non-metastatic prostate cancer at diagnosis 43.1% had localised disease, 5.1% had regional spread and 51.9% had unknown stage.

We estimated the incidence of these outcomes among M0-PC patients on ADT and identified prostate-specific antigen (PSA) based biomarkers for mortality and metastasis.This population-based cohort study included all nonmetastatic prostate cancer patients in Northern and Central Denmark Regions during 1997\u20132010, identified through registry data. Primary outcomes were metastasis, overall survival, and bone metastasis-free survival (BMFS). We estimated relative risks (RR) associated with PSA and PSA doubling-time (PSA-DT), measured as time-varying variables beginning at ADT treatment start.We included 2494 M0-PC patients treated with ADT, of whom 1617 (80%) developed CRPC during follow-up. One-fourth of the patients developed metastases within 5 years; bone metastases (BM) accounted for 81% of all metastases. Median survival time was 4.4 years. Compared with PSA <8\u00a0ng/mL, PSA \u22658\u00a0ng/mL was associated with an adjusted RR of 14.0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.2, 19.0) for BM, 4.4 (CI: 3.9, 5.0) for all-cause mortality, and RR of 4.8 (CI: 4.3, 5.4) for the inverse of BMFS.

We compared all-cause mortality between foreign-born and Sweden-born residents of Sweden who were diagnosed with cancer of the colon, lung, stomach, prostate, breast, cervix, and all site.We used Swedish national vital status and health registers to follow a cohort of 1,556,108 patients 45 years of age and older diagnosed with cancer between 1961 and 2009 in Sweden. Among them, 109,915 were born abroad. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models.We identified 604,035 and 540,138 deaths among men and women, respectively. Among them 33,595 men and 34,174 women were born abroad. At the time of diagnosis, patients born abroad were on average 4 years younger than patients born in Sweden. All-cause mortality was generally lower in the former than in the latter group of patients before 1990 but higher after 2000. The mortality trend was similar for prostate and breast cancer.Whilst national policy in Sweden aims at achieving equal access to health care, the mortality trend observed among cancer patients born in Sweden was different from that observed among patients born elsewhere. Mortality after diagnosis of major types of cancer has worsened among foreign-born after the year 2000. The possible determinants of disparities need be identified and investigated.",

We estimated net survival for each of the five deprivation categories (affluent, 2, 3, 4, deprived), cancer site, sex and age group (15\u201344, 45\u201354, 55\u201364, and 65\u201374 and 75\u201399 years).The magnitude and pattern of the age specific socioeconomic inequalities in survival was different for breast, colon and lung. For breast cancer the deprivation gap in 1-year survival widened with increasing age at diagnosis, whereas the opposite was true for lung cancer, with colon cancer having an intermediate pattern. The \u2018deprivation gap\u2019 in 1-year breast cancer survival widened steadily from \u22120.8% for women diagnosed at 15\u201344 years to \u22124.8% for women diagnosed at 75\u201399 years, and was the widest for women diagnosed at 65\u221274 years for 5- and 10-year survival.

However, it is unknown whether recent Pap testing by HPV vaccination status varies by race/ethnicity. Discerning racial/ethnic variations is important given the higher prevalence of HPV types other than 16 and 18 in some racial/ethnic groups. We assessed whether uptake of recent Pap testing differed among women aged 21\u201330 years who had not initiated the HPV vaccination series versus those who had and whether this pattern differed by sociodemographic factors.2008, 2010, and 2013 National Health Interview Survey data were used to generate weighted prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) (n\u00a0=\u00a07095). Adjusted predicted marginal models were used to generate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) to assess the relationship between recent Pap test uptake and HPV vaccination series initiation by race/ethnicity.The uptake of recent Pap testing among those who had not initiated the HPV vaccination series was significantly lower (81.0%) compared to those who had initiated vaccination (90.5%) (aPR\u00a0=\u00a00.93, 95% CI: 0.90\u20130.96). This finding was consistent across most sociodemographic factors, though not statistically significant for Blacks, Hispanics, those with lower levels of education, or those with higher levels of income.Young women who had not initiated HPV vaccination were less likely to have had a recent Pap test compared to women who had initiated vaccination. Concerted efforts are needed to increase uptake of recommended cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination among young women.",

A Poisson regression model was used to estimate potentially missed incident cases of HCC by country and region based on the country risk factor covariate values.The results indicated that HBV and HCV prevalence were significantly associated with HCC incidence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and potentially accounted for 94%% of incident HCC in 2012. We estimated a total of 120,772 potentially missed incident HCC cases in 2012. These cases are largely predicted for South Asia (>21,000), North Asia (>15,000), Western Africa (14,500) and Eastern Africa (12,500).Developing countries, with poorer quality data and a high historical burden of hepatitis, were predicted to have the majority of missed HCC cases in 2012 based on our model. These countries are, therefore, less able to detect, budget for or manage HCC. The high cost of HCC treatment, as well as its economic implications, poses a challenge in resource poor settings.",

Patient characteristics were obtained from clinical records. Mutation testing was performed on available tumor samples. Exploratory analyses were performed to characterize the clinico-pathological factors associated with presence of EGFR mutations.From March 2010 to March 2011, 1113 patients were included in the study, of which 1009 patients provided sample for EGFR mutation analysis (90.7%). Mutation analysis was not feasible in 146/1113 patients (13.1%) due to either sample unavailability (79/1113; 7.1%) or sample inadequacy (67/1113; 6.0%). Twenty-five out of 1113 patients (2.3%) were excluded due to unavailable information. Most patients (99.5%) were Caucasian, 74.5% were male, and predominantly were current (38.1%) or former smokers (44.0%). Median age was 66 years (range 25\u201390) and 70.7% of patients had non-squamous histology (57.8% adenocarcinoma, 1.8% bronchoalveolar, 11.1% large-cell carcinoma). Exon 19 deletions and the exon 21 L858R point mutation were analyzed in 942/1009 (93.4%) samples. Mutation rate was 11.6% (82.6% exon 19 dels and 17.4% L858R). To be never smoker (38.1%), female (25.4%), with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (22.2%) or adenocarcinoma (15.4%) histology was associated with a higher prevalence of EGFR mutations. Exons 18, 20 and 21 (excluding L858R) were analyzed in 505/942 samples, and EGFR mutations were found in 22/505 samples (4.4%).The estimated prevalence of sensitizing EGFR mutations (exon 19 del, exon 21 L858R) in an unselected samples of newly diagnosed aNSCLC patients in Spain (all histologies) is consistent with previous published data in Caucasian patients. When a sample is available, EGFR mutation testing is feasible in over 90% of cases, and may therefore be suitable for routine clinical practice.NCT01081496.",

In this study, we present the incidence, age distribution and localization of musculoskeletal tumors diagnosed and/or treated at a tertiary referral orthopedic department, catering to an entire Southeastern European country.This was a retrospective study of prospectively collected data, in which all patients diagnosed and/or treated for musculoskeletal tumors at our Department in the period of 30 years (1981\u20132010) were included.Data of a total of 3482 patients with musculoskeletal tumors were collected. Average age of patients was 33.5 years (range, 2 months\u201388 years), with even distribution according to sex. Malignant tumors were seen in 20.7% of patients, more often in men (56.9%). Most common malignant tumors were osteosarcoma (estimated incidence: 1.68/million/year), chondrosarcoma (0.79/million/year) and Ewing sarcoma (0.76/million/year). Benign tumors and tumor-like lesions were found in 79.3% of patients, with slight female predominance. Most common benign bone lesions were osteochondroma (5.81/million/year), simple bone cyst (2.13/million/year), and enchondroma (2.05/million/year).This report represents a first of its kind in our region, and gives representative results to be compared to other middle and south European countries. Further nationwide studies are needed to improve strategies in bone tumor diagnosis and treatment.",

     "abstract": "It has been suggested that the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma might be increased in patients with a history of eating disorders due to acidic damage to oesophageal mucosa caused by self-induced vomiting practiced as a method of weight control. Eating disorders have also been associated with risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, including alcohol use disorders, as well as smoking and nutritional deficiencies, which have been associated with both main sub-types of oesophageal cancer. There have been several case reports of oesophageal cancer (both main sub-types) arising in patients with a history of eating disorders.We used linked records of hospitalisation, cancer registration and mortality in Scotland spanning 1981\u20132012 to investigate the risk of oesophageal cancer among patients with a prior history of hospitalisation with eating disorder. The cohort was restricted to patients aged \u226510 years and <60 years at the date of first admission with eating disorder. Disregarding the first year of follow-up, we calculated indirectly standardised incidence ratios using the general population as the reference group to generate expected numbers of cases (based on age-, sex-, socio-economic deprivation category-, and calendar period-specific rates of disease).After exclusions, the cohort consisted of 3617 individuals contributing 52,455 person-years at risk. The median duration of follow-up was 13.9 years. Seven oesophageal cancers were identified, as compared with 1.14 expected, yielding a standardised incidence ratio of 6.1 (95% confidence interval: 2.5\u201312.6). All were squamous cell carcinomas arising in females with a prior history of anorexia nervosa.Patients hospitalised previously with eating disorders are at increased risk of developing oesophageal cancer. Confounding by established risk factors (alcohol, smoking, and nutritional deficiency) seems a more likely explanation than acidic damage through self-induced vomiting because none of the incident cases of oesophageal cancer were adenocarcinomas, and because the study cohort had higher than background rates of hospitalisation with alcohol-related conditions and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

Since acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by rapidly proliferating tissues that have a high requirement for DNA synthesis, it is possible that the presence of MTHFR polymorphisms could be linked to the multifactorial process of AML development.We evaluated the role of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in a case\u2013control study comprising 98 AML patients and 2016 healthy controls in a Southern Chinese population. We further conducted a sub-study restricted to individuals who neither smoked nor drank alcohol (70 AML patients and 160 healthy controls).

Logistic regression was used to assess the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).The MTHFR 1298AC genotype and the 677CC/1298AC haplotype were significantly associated with a decreased risk of AML compared with the AA genotype and 677CC/1298AA haplotype (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.60, 95% CI: 0.38\u20130.95, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03; OR\u00a0=\u00a00.49, 95% CI: 0.27\u20130.90, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02, respectively).

If genetic factors indeed determine tumor histology it would be expected that histological types would agree between affected first-degree relatives (FDRs).This study was conducted using the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database. FDR pairs were defined where both of them had the same histological subtype of CNS tumor. The histological concordance was determined using kappa agreement test.We identified 858 familial patients (333 parent\u2013offspring pairs, 97 sibling pairs) with primary CNS tumors. Proportion of spinal hemangioblastoma out of all familial hemangioblastomas (21%) was significantly higher than that in sporadic patients (7%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The highest kappa value was found for hemangioblastoma among parent\u2013child pairs (kappa\u00a0=\u00a086%, 95% CI: 74\u201398%).

     "abstract": "Few studies have examined the familial aggregation of melanoma or its co-aggregation with other cancers using whole-population based designs. This study aimed to investigate aggregation patterns in young Western Australian families, using population-based linked health data to identify individuals born in Western Australia between 1974 and 2007, their known relatives, and all incident cancer diagnoses within the resulting 1,506,961 individuals.Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compare the risk of melanoma for first-degree relatives of melanoma cases to that for first-degree relatives of controls, with bootstrapping used to account for correlations within families. The risk of (i) developing melanoma based on the number of first-degree relatives with other cancers, and (ii) developing non-melanoma cancers based on the number of first-degree relatives diagnosed with melanoma was also investigated.First-degree relatives of melanoma cases had a significantly greater incidence of melanoma than first-degree relatives of individuals not affected with melanoma (Hazard Ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a03.58, 95% bootstrap confidence interval (CI): 2.43\u20135.43). Sensitivity analyses produced a higher hazard ratio estimate when restricted to melanoma cases diagnosed before 40 years of age (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.77, bootstrap 95% CI: 2.49\u20136.39) and a lower estimate when only later-onset cases (>40 years) were considered (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.45, bootstrap 95% CI: 1.23\u20134.82). No significant evidence was found for co-aggregation between melanoma and any other cancers.Results indicated a strong familial basis of melanoma, with the higher than expected hazard ratio observed likely to reflect early-age at onset cases in this young cohort, supported by the results of the sensitivity analyses. Exploratory analyses suggested that the determinants of melanoma causing the observed aggregation within families may be independent of other malignancies, although these analyses were limited by the young age of the sample. Determining familial aggregation patterns will provide valuable knowledge regarding improved clinical risk prediction and the underlying biological mechanisms of melanoma and other cancers.",

From this data we retrieved information on prognostic factors, treatment information and lifestyle factors. Age, vital status, comorbidity, education, income and cohabitation status were ascertained from nationwide administrative registers. Associations were analyzed with logistic regression and Cox regression models.Educational level was weakly associated with cancer stage. Short education, lower income and living without a partner were related to poorer survival after ovarian cancer. Among women with early cancer stage, HR (95% CI) for death was 1.75 (1.20\u20132.54) in shorter compared to longer educated women. After adjustment for comorbid conditions, cancer stage, tumour histology, operation status and lifestyle factors, socioeconomic differences in survival persisted.Socioeconomic disparities in survival after ovarian cancer were to some extent, but not fully explained by differences in important prognostic factors, suggesting further investigations into this problem, however implying that socially less advantaged ovarian cancer patients should receive attention during cancer treatment and rehabilitation.",

ALDH1 protein was highly expressed in 29.07% (66/227) of bladder tumor tissues (i.e., 24.58% of noninvasive bladder cancer tissues vs. 33.94% of invasive bladder cancer tissues). In patients with noninvasive bladder cancer, ALDH1 protein expression was significantly associated with an advanced tumor grade and frequent tumor recurrence (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). In patients with invasive bladder cancer, ALDH1 protein expression was significantly associated with an advanced tumor grade, stage, as well as lymph node and distant metastases (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). After adjusting for the confounding factors, ALDH1 protein expression was significantly associated with relapse-free survival in noninvasive bladder cancer patients [HR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a04.45 (1.32\u201315.04); P\u00a0=\u00a00.027] and overall survival in invasive bladder cancer patients [HR (5% CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.86 (1.72\u20138.83); P\u00a0=\u00a00.020]. These data indicate that ALDH1 expression plays an important role in bladder cancer development and prognosis. Further validation of our results is warranted in a larger sample cohort, and further investigation of ALDH1 signaling and function will increase our understanding of ALDH1 in bladder cancer progression.",

The quality of cancer registry data has been estimated rather infrequently in past years.We aimed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the quality of the data at the Bulgarian National Cancer Registry (BNCR).Quantitative and semi-quantitative methods were applied for cancers diagnosed during the whole period 1993\u20132010, and also for cases diagnosed in 2006\u20132010. The methods used include historic data methods, mortality-to-incidence ratios (M:I), capture\u2013recapture and death-certificate methods, proportions of morphologically verified cases (MV%), death-certificate-only cases (DCO%), and cases with missing information (primary site unknown, PSU%; stage unknown, SU%).The BNCR coding and classification systems follow international standards. The overall completeness was estimated at 92.6\u201394.7% for the period 2006\u20132010, with variations between cancer sites (86.7\u201398.5%). During the period 1993\u20132010, M:I decreased to 0.5 for males and 0.4 for females, MV increased to 87.4%, DCO and SU decreased to 4.8% and 18.8%, respectively, and PSU remained at the same level of about 4% for both sexes together. Sub-analysis revealed differences by site, sex and age groups. The comparison with other registries from the region showed similar incidence rates and directions of trends: M:I, MV% and DCO% that were not significantly different. The underreporting in 2008 and 2009 due to timely publication was estimated at an overall 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively.The present review showed that the BNCR yields internationally comparable data that are reasonably accurate, timely, and close to complete, especially in recent years.

     "abstract": "Preventing risk factor exposure is vital to reduce the high burden from lung cancer. The leading risk factor for developing lung cancer is tobacco smoking. In Australia, despite apparent success in reducing smoking prevalence, there is limited information on small area patterns and small area temporal trends. We sought to estimate spatio-temporal patterns for lung cancer risk factors using routinely collected population-based cancer data.The analysis used a Bayesian shared component spatio-temporal model, with male and female lung cancer included separately. The shared component reflected lung cancer risk factors, and was modelled over 477 statistical local areas (SLAs) and 15 years in Queensland, Australia. Analyses were also run adjusting for area-level socioeconomic disadvantage, Indigenous population composition, or remoteness.Strong spatial patterns were observed in the underlying risk factor estimates for both males (median Relative Risk (RR) across SLAs compared to the Queensland average ranged from 0.48 to 2.00) and females (median RR range across SLAs 0.53\u20131.80), with high risks observed in many remote areas. Strong temporal trends were also observed. Males showed a decrease in the underlying risk across time, while females showed an increase followed by a decrease in the final 2 years. These patterns were largely consistent across each SLA. The high underlying risk estimates observed among disadvantaged, remote and indigenous areas decreased after adjustment, particularly among females.The modelled underlying risks appeared to reflect previous smoking prevalence, with a lag period of around 30 years, consistent with the time taken to develop lung cancer. The consistent temporal trends in lung cancer risk factors across small areas support the hypothesis that past interventions have been equally effective across the state. However, this also means that spatial inequalities have remained unaddressed, highlighting the potential for future interventions, particularly among remote areas.",

     "abstract": "Accurate identification of factors associated with progression of colorectal cancer remains a challenge. In particular, it is unclear which statistical methods are most suitable to separate the effects of putative prognostic factors on cancer progression vs cancer-specific and other cause mortality. To address these challenges, we analyzed 10 year follow-up data for patients who underwent curative surgery for colorectal cancer in 1985\u20132000. Separate analyses were performed in two French cancer registries. Results of three multivariable models were compared: Cox model with recurrence as a time-dependent variable, and two multi-state models, which separated prognostic factor effects on recurrence vs death, with or without recurrence. Conventional multi-state model analyzed all-cause mortality while new relative survival multi-state model focused on cancer-specific mortality. Among the 2517 and 2677 patients in the two registries, about 50% died without a recurrence, and 28% had a recurrence, of whom almost 90% died. In both multi-state models men had significantly increased risk of cancer recurrence in both registries (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.79; 95% CI: 0.68\u20130.92 and HR\u00a0=\u00a00.83; 95% CI: 0.71\u20130.96). However, the two multi-state models identified different prognostic factors for mortality without recurrence. In contrast to the conventional model, in the relative survival analyses gender had no independent association with cancer-specific mortality whereas patients diagnosed with stage III cancer had significantly higher risks in both registries (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.67; 95% CI: 1.27\u20132.22 and HR\u00a0=\u00a02.38; 95% CI: 1.29\u20133.27).

This work is essential to address this growing category of chronic diseases, but is made difficult by economic, geographic and other challenges.To evaluate the completeness, comparability and diagnostic validity of Nigeria's cancer registries.Completeness was measured using children's age-specific incidence (ASI) and an established metric based on a modified Poisson distribution with regional comparisons. We used a registry questionnaire as well as percentages of death-certificate-only cases, morphologically verified cases, and case registration errors to examine comparability and diagnostic validity.Among the children's results, we found that over half of all cancers were non-Hodgkin lymphoma. There was also evidence of incompleteness. Considering the regional completeness comparisons, we found potential evidence of cancer-specific general incompleteness as well as what appears to be incompleteness due to inability to diagnose specific cancers. We found that registration was generally comparable, with some exceptions. Since autopsies are not common across Nigeria, coding for both them and death-certificate-only cases was also rare. With one exception, registries in our study had high rates of morphological verification of female breast, cervical and prostate cancers.Nigeria's registration procedures were generally comparable to each other and to international standards, and we found high rates of morphological verification, suggesting high diagnostic validity.

     "abstract": "Background: Both cause-specific and relative survival settings can be used to estimate net survival, the survival that would be observed if the only possible underlying cause of death was the disease under study. Both resulting net survival estimators are biased by informative censoring and prone to biases related to the data settings within which each is derived. We took into account informative censoring to derive theoretically unbiased estimators and examine which of the two data settings was the most robust against incorrect assumptions in the data. Patients and methods: We identified 2489 women in the Geneva Cancer Registry, diagnosed with breast cancer between 1981 and 1991, and estimated net survival up to 20-years using both cause-specific and relative survival settings, by tackling the informative censoring with weights. To understand the possible origins of differences between the survival estimates, we performed sensitivity analyses within each setting. We evaluated the impact of misclassification of cause of death and of using inappropriate life tables on survival estimates. Results: Net survival was highest using the cause-specific setting, by 1% at one year and by up to around 11% twenty years after diagnosis. Differences between both sets of net survival estimates were eliminated after recoding between 15% and 20% of the non-specific deaths as breast cancer deaths. By contrast, a dramatic increase in the general population mortality rates was needed to see the survival estimates based on relative survival setting become closer to those derived from cause-specific setting. Conclusion: Net survival estimates derived using the cause-specific setting are very sensitive to misclassification of cause of death. Net survival estimates derived using the relative-survival setting were robust to large changes in expected mortality. The relative survival setting is recommended for estimation of long-term net survival among patients with breast cancer.",

Prediction bases were considered within the time periods 1951\u20132006 in Spain and 1975\u20132007 in Finland, and then predictions were made for 37 and 33 single years in these periods, respectively. The performance of three fixed different prediction bases (last 5, 10, and 20 years of historical data) was compared to that of the prediction base determined by the GoF-optimal method.

     "abstract": "To analyze the spatio-temporal evolution of brain cancer relative mortality risks in young population (under 20 years of age) in Spanish provinces during the period 1986\u20132010.A new and flexible conditional autoregressive spatio-temporal model with two levels of spatial aggregation was used.Brain cancer relative mortality risks in young population in Spanish provinces decreased during the last years, although a clear increase was observed during the 1990s. The global geographical pattern emphasized a high relative mortality risk in Navarre and a low relative mortality risk in Madrid. Although there is a specific Autonomous Region\u2013time interaction effect on the relative mortality risks this effect is weak in the final estimates when compared to the global spatial and temporal effects.Differences in mortality between regions and over time may be caused by the increase in survival rates, the differences in treatment or the availability of diagnostic tools. The increase in relative risks observed in the 1990s was probably due to improved diagnostics with computerized axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging techniques.",

     "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) is a member of the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); it is associated with invasive tumor growth and distant metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the prognostic value of MMP-7 in CRC remains controversial. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the prognostic value of MMP-7 expression in CRC.We systematically searched for studies evaluating the relationship between MMP-7 expression and the outcome of CRC patients in PubMed, the Cochrane library, Embase, Google Scholar, and Wanfang databases updated to August 2014. Studies were assessed for quality using REMARK (REporting recommendations for tumor MARKer prognostic studies). Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were pooled to estimate the hazard for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS), and odds ratios (ORs) with 95%CIs were pooled to estimate the impact of MMP-7 on the 5-year survival rate.In total, 2985 patients from 17 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Our results showed that MMP-7 over-expression predicted poor OS (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.57, 95%CI 2.21\u20135.75, P\u00a0=\u00a00.000, random-effect model), poor DFS (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.49, 95%CI 1.73\u20133.57, P\u00a0=\u00a00.000, fixed-effect model), and decreased 5-year survival rate (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.26, 95%CI 0.19\u20130.37, P\u00a0=\u00a00.000, fixed-effect model). Therefore, MMP-7 is an indicator of poor survival and high recurrence rate in CRC patients.MMP-7 can serve as a prognostic indicator and a potential novel target for treatment in CRC patients. More well-designed prospective studies with better methodology for MMP-7 assessment are required to clarify the prognostic significance of MMP-7 expression in CRC patients.",

     "abstract": "The incidence of oesophageal cancer (OC) varies geographically, with more than 80% of cases and deaths worldwide occurring in developing countries. The aim of this study is to characterize the disease burden of OC in four urban populations in Eastern Africa, which may represent a previously undescribed high-incidence area. Data on all cases of OC diagnosed between 2004 and 2008 were obtained from four population-based cancer registries in: Blantyre, Malawi; Harare, Zimbabwe; Kampala, Uganda; and Nairobi, Kenya. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) were calculated for each population, and descriptive statistics for incident cases were determined. In Blantyre, 351 male (59%) and 239 (41%) female cases were reported, with ASRs of 47.2 and 30.3. In Harare, 213 male (61%) and 134 (39%) female cases were reported, with ASRs of 33.4 and 25.3, respectively. In Kampala, 196 male (59%) and 137 female (41%) cases were reported, with ASRs of 36.7 and 24.8. In Nairobi, 323 male (57%) and 239 female (43%) cases were reported, with ASRs of 22.6 and 21.6. Median age at diagnosis was significantly different among the four populations, ranging from 50 years in Blantyre to 65 years in Harare (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Except in Nairobi, incidence among males was significantly higher than among females (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Squamous cell OC was the predominant histologic subtype at all sites. ASRs at all four sites were remarkably higher than the mean worldwide ASR. Investigation to evaluate potential etiologic effects of dietary, lifestyle, environmental, and other factors impacting the incidence in this region is needed.",

Participants were recruited from the Shanxi Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Genetics Project and the Linxian Nutrition Intervention Trials, and included 1942 ESCC cases and 2111 controls. We used logistic models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the SNP associations, after controlling for age and gender.None of the 12 evaluated SNPs in the four vitamin D-related genes were significantly associated with risk of ESCC.

Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinaemia, and circulating insulin and C-peptide, a biomarker of insulin levels, have been positively associated with colorectal cancer risk. However, whether a similar relationship exists for colorectal adenomas, an established colorectal cancer precursor, is unclear.In a nested case-control study of 273 colorectal adenoma cases and 355 matched controls from the screening arm of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, serum C-peptide levels were measured by a chemiluminescent immunometric assay. Multivariable unconditional logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal adenoma within quartiles of C-peptide. Further, to explore the temporal stability of C-peptide, repeat samples from the incident adenoma cases (n\u00a0=\u00a050) and controls (n\u00a0=\u00a030), over a 5-year period were assayed and the intra-class correlations (ICC) estimated.In a multivariable model that included established colorectal adenoma risk factors, C-peptide levels were not associated with colorectal adenoma (Q4 vs. Q1, OR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.52\u20131.31; P-trend 0.32); similar null associations were observed by gender, by adenoma subsite and for advanced adenomas. Among control participants, the ICC value over a 5-year period was 0.66.Our results suggest that higher C-peptide levels were not associated with colorectal adenoma incidence in this study population. Other biological pathways associated with obesity may be more relevant to the early stages of colorectal tumorigenesis.",

However, this mutation is associated with a lower cumulative lifetime cancer risk than other mutations in the p53 DNA-binding domain. A detailed statistical analysis of 171,500 DNA tests in Brazilian neonates found that 0.27% of the general population is positive for this mutation, and some of the estimated 200,000 Brazilian R337H carriers in southern and southeastern Brazil have already developed cancer. The present study was designed to estimate R337H prevalence in neighboring Paraguay. To address this question, 10,000 dried blood samples stored in Guthrie cards since 2008 were randomly selected from the Paraguayan municipalities located at the border with Brazil. These samples were tested for R337H mutation using the PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. This germline mutation was detected in five samples (5/10,000), indicating that the total number of R337H carriers in Paraguay may be as high as 3500. Previous studies have shown that other countries (i.e., Portugal, Spain, and Germany) presented one family with this mutation, leading us to conclude that, besides Brazil and Paraguay, other countries may have multiple families carrying this mutation, which is an inherited syndrome that is difficult to control.",

The current study aims to assess the respective contributions of both mammographic tumour appearance and the triple-negative marker, and their possible interactions, on the long-term survival of breast cancer, taking into account the prognostic factors already established.A retrospective cohort of 498 breast cancer patients was enrolled at Falun Central Hospital, Sweden, between 1996 and 1998, and information on immunohistochemical markers and histological tumour distribution in these patients was collected. This cohort \u2013 together with prior information on conventional tumour attributes and mammographic tumour features from 1968 to 1995 \u2013 was formed by the Bayesian method and was followed over time until the end of 2011.After considering tumour attributes, histological tumour distribution, and triple-negative cancer, two mammographic tumour features \u2013 casting type (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR\u00a0=\u00a03.47, 2.21\u20135.53) and architectural distortion (aHR\u00a0=\u00a04.43, 2.02\u20139.50) \u2013 had poorer survival compared to other types (stellate, circular, crushed-stone-like, and powdery mass). Triple-negative status conferred an independent 1.95-fold (1.06\u20133.52) higher risk for death from breast cancer than non-triple-negative status. Stratified by mammographic tumour features, the impact of triple-negative status on the prognosis of breast cancer was statistically significantly greater for the casting and architecturally distorted types (aHR\u00a0=\u00a05.40, 1.40\u201320.59) but was not statistically significant for other types of mammographic appearance (aHR\u00a0=\u00a01.75, 0.75\u20134.21). Stratified by the triple-negative feature, the effect of casting type and architectural distortion versus other tumour types on the risk of breast cancer death was statistically significant not only among triple-negative breast cancers (aHR\u00a0=\u00a09.67, 2.74\u201329.54) but also among non-triple-negative cancers (aHR\u00a0=\u00a04.11, 1.88\u20138.68).In addition to demonstrating mammographic appearance and the triple-negative feature as two independent prognostic factors, the most novel finding of this study is that the triple-negative feature played a more important role among breast tumours with the mammographic appearance of casting and architectural distortion than among tumours with other types of mammographic appearance. The risk stratification of long-term prognosis of breast cancer in the light of multi-attribute information in chronological order (mammographic tumour appearance first and then the triple-negative test) may aid clinicians in developing a customised schedule of surveillance and in optimising treatment and adjuvant therapy.",

     "abstract": "The early diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer are important for the prognosis of patients with lung cancer. This study was undertaken to investigate patient and doctor delays in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC and the factors affecting these delays.A total of 1016 patients, including 926 (91.1%) males and 90 (8.9%) females with a mean age of 61.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1 years, were enrolled prospectively in this study between May 2010 and May 2011 from 17 sites in various Turkish provinces.The patient delay was found to be 49.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a096.9 days, doctor delay was found to be 87.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a099.6 days, and total delay was found to be 131.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0135.2 days. The referral delay was found to be 61.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0127.2 days, diagnostic delay was found to be 20.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a044.5 days, and treatment delay was found to be 24.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a054.9 days. When the major factors responsible for these delays were examined, patient delay was found to be more frequent in workers, while referral delay was found to be more frequent in patients living in villages (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We determined that referral delay, doctor delay, and total delay increased as the number of doctors who were consulted by patients increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Additionally, we determined that diagnostic and treatment delays were more frequent at the early tumour stages in NSCLC patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The extended length of patient delay underscores the necessity of educating people about lung cancer. To decrease doctor delay, education is a crucial first step. Additionally, to further reduce the diagnostic and treatment delays of chest specialists, multidisciplinary management and algorithms must be used regularly.",

     "abstract": "The heterogeneous nature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) complicates therapeutic decision making, particularly for newly diagnosed disease. Factors impacting the treatment plan in this early period of disease course are poorly defined. This study determines whether therapeutic choices for newly diagnosed MDS are associated with location of treatment (community or academic), prognostic risk category, and patient age.The adults in Minnesota with myelodysplastic syndromes (AIMMS) database was utilized in this statewide, prospective population-based study conducted by the University of Minnesota (UMN), Mayo Clinic, and Minnesota Department of Health. Adult (age 20+ years) cases of MDS newly diagnosed starting in April 2010 were invited to participate. This analysis includes patients enrolled during the first study year with 1-year follow-up data. Treatment choices (supportive, active, and transplant) were stratified by the international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) and the revised-IPSS (IPSS-R), then separated into groups by location of care and age (<65 or 65+ years). Academic-based care was any contact with the UMN and Mayo Clinic; community-based care was all other clinical sites.Stratification by IPSS and IPSS-R showed supportive care decreased and active care increased with advancing risk categories (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Comparing treatment setting, community-based care had 77% supportive and 23% active treatment; academic-based care was 36% supportive, 41% active, and 23% transplant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). By age groups, patients <65 years with intermediate, high, or very high risk disease by IPSS-R received 97% active care/transplant, compared to only 52% of patients age 65+.Younger patients and those treated at academic centers had a more aggressive treatment approach. Whether these treatment differences convey improved disease control and mortality, and therefore should be extended more frequently to older and community-based patients, is the subject of ongoing prospective study.",

     "abstract": "To identify factors associated with whether women in Colombia have had a Pap test, evaluate differences in risk factors between rural and urban residence, and evaluate the contextual effect of the lack of education on having ever had a Pap test.Data used were from the 2010 Colombian National Demographic and Health Survey; 40,392 women reported whether they have had a Pap test. A multilevel mixed logistic regression model was developed with random intercepts to account for clustering by neighbourhood and municipality. The model evaluated whether having a rural/urban area of residence modified the effect of identified risk factors and if the prevalence of no education at the neighbourhood level acted as a contextual effect.Most women (87.3%) reported having at least one Pap test. Women from lower socioeconomic quintiles (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), who were unemployed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and whose final health decisions depended on others (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were less likely to have had a Pap test. Women with children were more likely to have had the test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and the effects of education (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), type of health insurance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and region (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) varied with having a rural/urban area of residence. Women living in rural areas (specifically younger ones, with no health insurance, living in the Atlantic and Amazon-Orinoqu\u00eda regions, and with no education) were less likely to have had a Pap test when compared to those living in urban areas. Furthermore, women living in a neighbourhood with a higher prevalence of no education were less likely to have ever had a Pap test (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005).In Colombia, the probability of having had a Pap test is associated with personal attributes, area of residence, and prevalence of no education in the neighbourhood. Efforts to improve access to cervical cancer screening should focus on disadvantaged women with limited education, low socioeconomic status, and no health insurance or subsidised insurance, especially those in rural/isolated areas.",

It is unclear whether this represents a true rise in incidence or whether it is caused by an increased awareness of the condition.To assess whether the increase was characterised by early-stage melanomas and a higher proportion of melanomas with superficial spreading morphology, we studied all skin melanoma patients registered in the Danish Cancer Register 1989\u20132011 (n\u00a0=\u00a027,010) and followed up for death through 2013. Trends in age-standardised incidence by sex, subsite and morphology, relative survival, TNM stage distribution and stage-specific relative survival from 2004 were analysed.The incidence of melanoma more than doubled over 23 years. A steeper increase from 2004 was driven mainly by superficial spreading tumours, but the proportion of nodular melanomas in patients 50 years of age and over also increased significantly. The largest increase occurred for stage I tumours and for tumours on the trunk. From 1989\u20131993 to 2009\u20132011 the 5-year relative survival increased at 12% and 6% points for male and female patients, respectively.Greater awareness, and thus lower stage at diagnosis (mediated by a large skin cancer prevention campaign from 2007), might explain part of the increase, but the increase in nodular melanoma also points to a genuine increase in the risk of melanoma.",

We describe a method for estimating complete prevalence of prostate cancer to provide a measure of the burden of prostate cancer in Australia.Prostate cancer data from the New South Wales (NSW) Central Cancer Registry were used with PIAMOD (Prevalence and Incidence Analysis MODel) software to estimate future prostate cancer prevalence in NSW. We first fitted parametric incidence and survival models then used the modelled incidence and survival estimates to calculate complete prevalence. The estimated and projected prevalence incorporate past observed trends and take into account different assumptions about future survival trends. These models were validated against observed prevalence from the counting method.Based on data for 1996\u20132007, the number of men living with prostate cancer in NSW was estimated to rise by 59% to 73%, from 38,322 in 2007 to 60,910\u201366,160 in 2017. The increasing incidence rates and the ageing population were the major contributors to this estimated increase. Validation suggested that these projections were reasonable, as the estimated prevalence in 1996\u20132007 was in good agreement with the corresponding prevalence calculated using the direct counting method, and the incidence models were supported by the recent data on prostate-specific antigen testing.As the number of men living with prostate cancer is expected to increase dramatically in the next decade in Australia, representing a significant challenge to the health system, careful planning and development of a healthcare system able to respond to this increased demand is required. These projections are useful for addressing the challenge in meeting the cancer care needs of men with prostate cancer.",

However, trial participants differ from patients in the general population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between age and breast cancer outcome in an unselected group of older breast cancer patients.We included all older (65 years and older) consecutive breast cancer patients, diagnosed between 1997 and 2004 from a geographically defined area in the Netherlands. Primary outcome was relative survival and the secondary endpoint was breast cancer recurrence. These outcomes were compared between two age-categories (65\u201374 years and \u226575 years).Five-year relative survival was 91.9% in patients aged 65\u201374 years, and 84.3% in patients aged \u226575 years. This corresponded with a higher excess risk of death in patients aged \u226575 years as compared to patients aged 65\u201374 years (multivariable relative excess risk of death: 1.73 (95% CI 1.20\u20132.49)). The risks of locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence and contralateral breast cancer were similar in both age-categories.Breast cancer survival deteriorates with increasing age among unselected older breast cancer patients. Of note, this was not accompanied by an increased risk of recurrence. This study shows that not only in relatively healthy patients who participate in a trial, but in all older breast cancer patients, outcome deteriorates with increasing age. These findings urge the need for age-specific breast cancer studies, in order to obtain evidence-based medicine in this large and heterogeneous group of patients.",

Cancer incidence is compared both visually (from incidence maps) and with Poisson regression analysis using mortality from chronic liver disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as a proxy for alcohol and tobacco prevalence, respectively.The incidence rates for oral cavity, pharyngeal and laryngeal cancer were comparable with the alcohol gradient. However, glottic cancer revealed a pattern that was more comparable with lung cancer. These two tumour types resembled more closely to the smoking pattern. Oesophageal cancer showed two patterns: squamous cell carcinoma was highly comparable with the background alcohol consumption, while adenocarcinoma was unrelated to one of our two proxies.Our approach and results are an encouraging example how data from a young cancer registry can be used in studies describing the regional cancer burden. The results can be useful for primary prevention to increase awareness for the public, authorities and health care professionals in specific subpopulations.",

A case\u2013control study was carried out in Italy, including 454 women with endometrial cancer and 908 hospital controls admitted to the same hospitals for acute, non-neoplastic diseases. Dietary information was based on a reproducible and valid food frequency questionnaire. A posteriori dietary patterns were obtained using principal component factor analysis on 28 nutrients. Odds ratios (ORs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained from multiple logistic regression models conditioned on age and study center, and adjusted for major known confounding factors. Positive associations were found for the \u201cWestern-type diet\u201d (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.63, 95% CI: 1.12\u20132.38, for the highest versus the lowest quartile category) and the \u201cAnimal-derived nutrients and polyunsaturated fatty acids\u201d patterns (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.76, 95% CI: 1.23\u20132.52).

With a view to providing new insight we investigated maternal prescription drug use and risk of childhood cancer primary care medical records collected as part of the United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study, a national population-based case\u2013control study conducted between 1991 and 1996.

Parental cancer diagnosis was defined as a time-varying exposure. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and its corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) as an estimate of the association between parental cancer and childhood mortality. We adjusted for attained age, sex, gestational age, mode of delivery and birth weight of the child, maternal age at child's birth, as well as educational level and socio-economic classification of the parents in the analyses.Among 113,555 children with parental cancer, 127 deaths occurred during 561,198 person\u2013years of follow-up.

Patient level data on this subject is relatively limited with regard to the demographics, diagnoses and the clinical factors that may underlie late presentations.A 15 month audit of the patients presenting with a new diagnosis of malignancy was performed in 2011\u20132012. Data on demographics, diagnosis and outcome were assembled and analysed. The clinical data on emergency presentations were compared to reference information on the incidence and median age at presentation for each malignancy within the standard population.During the study a total of 178 new cancer patients presented via the A and E service. The most frequent diagnoses were lung cancer with 21% of cases and CNS and colorectal cancer each with 9% of cases. There was a higher incidence of emergency new presentations of lung cancer, CNS tumours, ovarian, pancreatic and testicular cancer than in the standard population, whilst breast cancer, bladder cancer and prostate cancer patients were under-represented.The median age at diagnosis was 74 and for a number of malignancies including CNS tumours, breast cancer, colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer the emergency cases presented at significantly greater ages than in the standard population. Overall 27% of patients were unfit or unsuitable for a diagnostic biopsy, this group had only a 3 month median survival compared to 14 months for those suitable for biopsy and treatment.Despite a wide range of initiatives, the emergency and late diagnosis of patients with metastatic cancer remains a significant challenge with many patients too advanced and unwell at presentation for active treatment. These patients tend to be older and have malignancies that present with either non-specific symptoms or symptoms requiring acute assessment. Improving the pathways for these patients will be challenging and require additional planning on improving awareness and access for these potentially hard to reach patients.",

A similar difference was seen in non-cancer controls. The number of GP contacts for chronic diseases did not differ between cancer patients and controls. The increase in the number of GP consultations with age and number of chronic diseases was similar in cancer patients and controls. Consultation rates were similar in cancer patients and controls if they were stratified by number of chronic diseases while counting cancer as a chronic disease.Two to five years after diagnosis, cancer leads to an increase in GP contacts that is similar to having a chronic disease. This increase does not differ between those with and without a chronic disease and cancer does not seem to increase the impact of having a chronic disease.",

We calculated the average gain in life years for each patient should socioeconomic differences in relative survival be removed and show how this is related to the number of all-cause deaths that could be postponed by removing socioeconomic differences in cancer patient survival.Our results indicate that deprivation differences for women with breast cancer exist and result in women from more deprived areas losing a larger proportion of their life due to a diagnosis of cancer. We also estimate that on average 1.1 years could be gained for a 60 year old breast cancer patient in the most deprived group by improving their relative survival to match the least deprived group. However, our results also show that deprivation differences in general survival have a large impact on life expectancy; showing that over two-thirds of the gap in differential life expectancy is explained by differences in other-cause survival.Socioeconomic differences in relative survival have an impact on life expectancy for patients and result in higher early mortality for more deprived patients.

A convenience sample for measuring the utility value with EQ-5D was conducted with 11,453 cancer patients, with the results then multiplied by the survival functions to estimate QALE. The loss-of-QALE was calculated by subtracting the QALE of each cancer cohort from the life expectancy of the corresponding age- and gender-matched reference population. The cumulative incidence rates from age 20 to 79 (CIR20\u201379) were calculated to estimate the lifetime risk of cancer for each organ-system.Liver and lung cancer were found the highest expected lifetime health impacts in males and females, or expected lifetime losses of 0.97 and 0.41 QALYs that could be averted, respectively. While the priority changes for prevention based on expected health impacts were slightly different for females based on standardized mortality rates, those of males involve a broader spectrum, including oral, colorectal, esophageal and stomach cancer.The integration of incidence rate with loss-of-QALE could be used to represent the expected losses that could be averted by prevention, which may be useful in prioritizing strategies for cancer control.",

It is estimated that this cancer burden could be reduced by up to one half if scientific knowledge on causes of cancer could be translated into successful prevention. The Code is a preventive tool aimed to reduce the cancer burden by informing people how to avoid or reduce carcinogenic exposures, adopt behaviours to reduce the cancer risk, or to participate in organised intervention programmes. The Code should also form a base to guide national health policies in cancer prevention. The 12 recommendations are: not smoking or using other tobacco products; avoiding second-hand smoke; being a healthy body weight; encouraging physical activity; having a healthy diet; limiting alcohol consumption, with not drinking alcohol being better for cancer prevention; avoiding too much exposure to ultraviolet radiation; avoiding cancer-causing agents at the workplace; reducing exposure to high levels of radon; encouraging breastfeeding; limiting the use of hormone replacement therapy; participating in organised vaccination programmes against hepatitis B for newborns and human papillomavirus for girls; and participating in organised screening programmes for bowel cancer, breast cancer, and cervical cancer.",

Common procedures were developed to guide the experts in identifying, retrieving, assessing, interpreting and summarizing the scientific evidence in order to revise the recommendations. The Code strictly followed the concept of providing advice to European Union citizens based on the current best available science. The advice, if followed, would be expected to reduce cancer risk, referring both to avoiding or reducing exposure to carcinogenic agents or changing behaviour related to cancer risk and to participating in medical interventions able to avert specific cancers or their consequences.

     "abstract": "Tobacco use, and in particular cigarette smoking, is the single largest preventable cause of cancer in the European Union (EU). All tobacco products contain a wide range of carcinogens. The main cancer-causing agents in tobacco smoke are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tobacco-specific N-nitrosamines, aromatic amines, aldehydes, and certain volatile organic compounds. Tobacco consumers are also exposed to nicotine, leading to tobacco addiction in many users. Cigarette smoking causes cancer in multiple organs and is the main cause of lung cancer, responsible for approximately 82% of cases. In 2012, about 313,000 new cases of lung cancer and 268,000 lung cancer deaths were reported in the EU; 28% of adults in the EU smoked tobacco, and the overall prevalence of current use of smokeless tobacco products was almost 2%. Smokeless tobacco products, a heterogeneous category, are also carcinogenic but cause a lower burden of cancer deaths than tobacco smoking. One low-nitrosamine product, snus, is associated with much lower cancer risk than other smokeless tobacco products. Smoking generates second-hand smoke (SHS), an established cause of lung cancer, and inhalation of SHS by non-smokers is still common in indoor workplaces as well as indoor public places, and more so in the homes of smokers. Several interventions have proved effective for stopping smoking; the most effective intervention is the use of a combination of pharmacotherapy and behavioural support. Scientific evidence leads to the following two recommendations for individual action on tobacco in the 4th edition of the European Code Against Cancer: (1) \u201cDo not smoke. Do not use any form of tobacco\u201d; (2) \u201cMake your home smoke-free. Support smoke-free policies in your workplace\u201d.",

Metabolic alterations which accompany excess body weight are accompanied by increased levels of inflammation, insulin, oestrogens and other hormonal factors. There are some indications that intentional weight loss is associated with reduced cancer incidence (notably in postmenopausal breast and endometrial cancers). Excess body weight is also a risk factor for several other diseases, including diabetes and heart disease, and is related to higher risk of premature death.In reviewing the current evidence related to excess body fat and cancer, the European Code against Cancer Nutrition Working Group has developed the following recommendation: \u2018Take action to be a healthy body weight\u2019.",

     "abstract": "Physical activity is a complex, multidimensional behavior, the precise measurement of which is challenging in free-living individuals. Nonetheless, representative survey data show that 35% of the European adult population is physically inactive. Inadequate levels of physical activity are disconcerting given substantial epidemiologic evidence showing that physical activity is associated with decreased risks of colon, endometrial, and breast cancers. For example, insufficient physical activity levels are thought to cause 9% of breast cancer cases and 10% of colon cancer cases in Europe. By comparison, the evidence for a beneficial effect of physical activity is less consistent for cancers of the lung, pancreas, ovary, prostate, kidney, and stomach. The biologic pathways underlying the association between physical activity and cancer risk are incompletely defined, but potential etiologic pathways include insulin resistance, growth factors, adipocytokines, steroid hormones, and immune function. In recent years, sedentary behavior has emerged as a potential independent determinant of cancer risk. In cancer survivors, physical activity has shown positive effects on body composition, physical fitness, quality of life, anxiety, and self-esteem. Physical activity may also carry benefits regarding cancer survival, but more evidence linking increased physical activity to prolonged cancer survival is needed. Future studies using new technologies \u2013 such as accelerometers and e-tools \u2013 will contribute to improved assessments of physical activity. Such advancements in physical activity measurement will help clarify the relationship between physical activity and cancer risk and survival. Taking the overall existing evidence into account, the fourth edition of the European Code against Cancer recommends that people be physically active in everyday life and limit the time spent sitting.",

     "abstract": "Lifestyle factors, including diet, have long been recognised as potentially important determinants of cancer risk. In addition to the significant role diet plays in affecting body fatness, a risk factor for several cancers, experimental studies have indicated that diet may influence the cancer process in several ways. Prospective studies have shown that dietary patterns characterised by higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain foods, and lower intakes of red and processed meats and salt, are related to reduced risks of death and cancer, and that a healthy diet can improve overall survival after diagnosis of breast and colorectal cancers. There is evidence that high intakes of fruit and vegetables may reduce the risk of cancers of the aerodigestive tract, and the evidence that dietary fibre protects against colorectal cancer is convincing. Red and processed meats increase the risk of colorectal cancer. Diets rich in high-calorie foods, such as fatty and sugary foods, may lead to increased calorie intake, thereby promoting obesity and leading to an increased risk of cancer. There is some evidence that sugary drinks are related to an increased risk of pancreatic cancer.Taking this evidence into account, the 4th edition of the European Code against Cancer recommends that people have a healthy diet to reduce their risk of cancer: they should eat plenty of whole grains, pulses, vegetables and fruits; limit high-calorie foods (foods high in sugar or fat); avoid sugary drinks and processed meat; and limit red meat and foods high in salt.",

     "abstract": "Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is part of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted naturally from the sun or from artificial sources such as tanning devices. Acute skin reactions induced by UVR exposure are erythema (skin reddening), or sunburn, and the acquisition of a suntan triggered by UVR-induced DNA damage. UVR exposure is the main cause of skin cancer, including cutaneous malignant melanoma, basal-cell carcinoma, and squamous-cell carcinoma. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in fair-skinned populations, and its incidence has increased steeply over recent decades. According to estimates for 2012, about 100,000 new cases of cutaneous melanoma and about 22,000 deaths from it occurred in Europe. The main mechanisms by which UVR causes cancer are well understood. Exposure during childhood appears to be particularly harmful. Exposure to UVR is a risk factor modifiable by individuals\u2019 behaviour. Excessive exposure from natural sources can be avoided by seeking shade when the sun is strongest, by wearing appropriate clothing, and by appropriately applying sunscreens if direct sunlight is unavoidable. Exposure from artificial sources can be completely avoided by not using sunbeds. Beneficial effects of sun or UVR exposure, such as for vitamin D production, can be fully achieved while still avoiding too much sun exposure and the use of sunbeds. Taking all the scientific evidence together, the recommendation of the 4th edition of the European Code Against Cancer for ultraviolet radiation is: \u201cAvoid too much sun, especially for children. Use sun protection. Do not use sunbeds.\u201d",

Several chemicals, metals, dusts, fibres, and occupations have been established to be causally associated with an increased risk of specific cancers, such as cancers of the lung, skin and urinary bladder, and mesothelioma. Significant amounts of air pollutants \u2013 mainly from road transport and industry \u2013 continue to be emitted in the European Union (EU); an increased occurrence of lung cancer has been attributed to air pollution even in areas below the EU limits for daily air pollution. Additionally, a wide range of pesticides as well as industrial and household chemicals may lead to widespread human exposure, mainly through food and water. For most environmental pollutants, the most effective measures are regulations and community actions aimed at reducing and eliminating the exposures. Thus, it is imperative to raise awareness about environmental and occupational carcinogens in order to motivate individuals to be proactive in advocating protection and supporting initiatives aimed at reducing pollution. Regulations are not homogeneous across EU countries, and protective measures in the workplace are not used consistently by all workers all the time; compliance with regulations needs to be continuously monitored and enforced. Therefore, the recommendation on Environment and Occupation of the 4th edition of the European Code against Cancer, focusing on what individuals can do to reduce their cancer risk, reads: \u201cIn the workplace, protect yourself against cancer-causing substances by following health and safety instructions.\u201d",

Key evidence for the carcinogenicity of ionising radiation comes from: follow-up studies of the survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan; other epidemiological studies of groups that have been exposed to radiation from medical, occupational or environmental sources; experimental animal studies; and studies of cellular responses to radiation. Considering exposure to environmental ionising radiation, inhalation of naturally occurring radon is the major source of radiation in the population \u2013 in doses orders of magnitude higher than those from nuclear power production or nuclear fallout. Indoor exposure to radon and its decay products is an important cause of lung cancer; radon may cause approximately one in ten lung cancers in Europe. Exposures to radon in buildings can be reduced via a three-step process of identifying those with potentially elevated radon levels, measuring radon levels, and reducing exposure by installation of remediation systems. In the 4th Edition of the European Code against Cancer it is therefore recommended to: \u201cFind out if you are exposed to radiation from naturally high radon levels in your home. Take action to reduce high radon levels\u201d. Non-ionising types of radiation (those with insufficient energy to ionise molecules) \u2013 including extremely low-frequency electric and magnetic fields as well as radiofrequency electromagnetic fields \u2013 are not an established cause of cancer and are therefore not addressed in the recommendations to reduce cancer risk.",

Current evidence shows that HRT, generally prescribed as menopausal hormone therapy, is associated with an increased risk of cancers of the breast, endometrium, and ovary, with the risk pattern depending on factors such as the type of therapy (oestrogen-only or combined oestrogen\u2013progestogen), duration of treatment, and initiation according to the time of menopause. Carcinogenicity has also been established for anti-neoplastic agents used in cancer therapy, immunosuppressants, oestrogen\u2013progestogen contraceptives, and tamoxifen. Medical use of ionising radiation, an established carcinogen, can provide major health benefits; however, prudent practices need to be in place, with procedures and techniques providing the needed diagnostic information or therapeutic gain with the lowest possible radiation exposure. For pharmaceutical drugs and medical radiation exposure with convincing evidence on their carcinogenicity, health benefits have to be balanced against the risks; potential increases in long-term cancer risk should be considered in the context of the often substantial and immediate health benefits from diagnosis and/or treatment. Thus, apart from HRT, no general recommendations on reducing cancer risk were given for carcinogenic drugs and medical radiation in the 4th edition of European Code against Cancer. It is crucial that the application of these measures relies on medical expertise and thorough benefit\u2013risk evaluation. This also pertains to cancer-preventive drugs, and self-medication with aspirin or other potential chemopreventive drugs is strongly discouraged because of the possibility of serious, potentially lethal, adverse events.",

EU citizens are recommended to participate in cancer screening each time an invitation from the national or regional screening program is received and after having read the information materials provided and carefully considered the potential benefits and harms of screening. Screening programs in the European Union vary with respect to the age groups invited and to the interval between invitations, depending on each country's cancer burden, local resources, and the type of screening test usedFor colorectal cancer, most programs in the EU invite men and women starting at the age of 50\u201360 years, and from then on every 2 years if the screening test is the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, or every 10 years or more if the screening test is flexible sigmoidoscopy or total colonoscopy.

     "abstract": "Breast cancer in the UK resident population of South Asian ethnicity has been lower than that in indigenous women. Leicester has a large South Asian population and a breast cancer unit with comprehensive data on diagnosed cancers. This study analysed the annual incidence of new breast cancer diagnoses in females from 1998 to 2009 to determine any changes in recent years.Ethnicity was known in over 98% of cases. Population denominators were based on published figures for 2001 and 2011, projected back to 1998. Age-adjusted directly standardised incidence rates were determined by ethnicity and broken down by invasive status and screening classification. Incidence rates were analysed using logistic regression in order to identify statistically significant effects of age, ethnicity, deprivation and year of diagnosis. Interactions with invasive status and screening classification were also investigated.At the start of the study period South Asian incidence was estimated to be 45% of that of the white population (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); by the end of the period the difference was still significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) but smaller, at 17%.South Asians should no longer be considered at low risk of breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a virus-related malignancy which most frequently arises in skin, though visceral sites can also be involved. Infection with Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV or HHV-8) is required for development of KS. Nowadays, most cases worldwide occur in persons who are immunosuppressed, usually because of HIV infection or as a result of therapy to combat rejection of a transplanted organ, but classic Kaposi sarcoma is predominantly a disease of the elderly without apparent immunosuppression. We analyzed 2667 KS incident cases diagnosed during 1995\u20132002 and registered by 75 population-based European cancer registries contributing to the RARECARE project. Total crude and age-standardized incidence rate was 0.3 per 100,000 per year with an estimated 1642 new cases per year in the EU27 countries. Age-standardized incidence rate was 0.8 per 100,000 in Southern Europe but below 0.3 per 100,000 in all other regions. The elevated rate in southern Europe was attributable to a combination of classic Kaposi sarcoma in some Mediterranean countries and the relatively high incidence of AIDS in several countries. Five-year relative survival for 2000\u20132002 by the period method was 75%. More than 10,000 persons were estimated to be alive in Europe at the beginning of 2008 with a past diagnosis of KS. The aetiological link with suppressed immunity means that many people alive following diagnosis of KS suffer comorbidity from a pre-existing condition. While KS is a rare cancer, it has a relatively good prognosis and so the number of people affected by it is quite large. Thus it provides a notable example of the importance of networking in diagnosis, therapy and research for rare cancers.",

Cancer-specific survival (CSS) analysis was performed using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method by calendar period: 1996\u20132000, 2001\u20132005 and 2006\u20132009. The log-rank test was used to detect differences in survival curves. Simultaneous assessment of prognostic factors was performed by a multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional-hazards regression model.619 HCCs were analysed. There was a significant increase of patients undergoing transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE), whereas patients undergoing curative or palliative supportive treatments remained unchanged (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). No shift to earlier stages was detected. Significant differences in CCS were observed by age-group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), diagnosis period (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), diagnosis technique (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0035), Barcelona-Clinic liver cancer stage (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), treatment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent impact on CSS of factors above mentioned, not including the diagnosis technique. Death risk was higher for patients diagnosed in 1996\u20132000 (HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.03; 1.68) and 2001\u20132005 (HR: 1.33; 95% CI: 1.05; 1.67) in comparison with 2006\u20132009 (reference group).The current population-based report describes a major increase in HCC survival. Simultaneously an increased use of TACE has been detected, probable cofactor of the observed survival increase. Possibly additional efforts could be made to decrease the HCC stage at diagnosis through active surveillance of cirrhotic patients to allow an increase in curative treatments. For sure efforts should be made to comply with a standardised staging system for HCC, particularly for comparative population-based issues.",

Incidence peaks in infancy, suggesting a role of in-utero and neonatal exposures but its aetiology is largely unknown. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the association between maternal characteristics and perinatal factors with the risk of NB, using data from the SETIL database.SETIL is a large Italian population-based case-control study established to evaluate several potential cancer risk factors in 0\u201310 year olds. Information about maternal characteristics, reproductive history, environmental and occupational exposures during pregnancy, as well as newborns\u2019 characteristics were obtained using a structured questionnaire. Extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) home exposure was measured. The study included 1044 healthy controls and 153 NB cases, diagnosed between 1998 and 2001.A twofold risk was associated to exposure in pregnancy to chemical products for domestic work and to hair dye. The risk associated with the latter was higher among 0\u201317 month old children (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.5, 95%CI: 1.0\u201329.3). Risk was increased for children whose mothers had suffered work related exposure in the preconception period to solvents (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.0 95%CI: 1.0\u20134.1) and in particular to aromatic hydrocarbons (OR\u00a0=\u00a09.2, 95%CI: 2.4\u201334.3). No association was observed with ELF-MF exposure. A higher risk was found among children with congenital malformations (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.9, 95%CI: 1.8\u201313.6) or neurofibromatosis (2 cases and 0 controls, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016).Our study suggests maternal exposure to hair dyes and aromatic hydrocarbons plays a role and deserves further investigation. The association with congenital malformations might also be explained by over-diagnosis.External exposure, in particular during and before pregnancy might contribute to NB occurrence.",

     "abstract": "Background: The etiology of prostate cancer (PCa) is poorly understood. Sexual activity and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are among factors under scrutiny, with controversial findings to date. Methods: We examined the association between the number and gender of sexual partners, STIs and PCa risk in the context of PROtEuS, a population-based case\u2013control study set amongst the mainly French-speaking population in Montreal, Canada. The study included 1590 histologically-confirmed PCa cases diagnosed in a Montreal French hospital between 2005 and 2009, and 1618 population controls ascertained from the French electoral list, Montreal residents, frequency-matched to cases by age. In-person interviews elicited information on sociodemographic, lifestyle and environmental factors. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between sexually related factors and PCa risk, adjusting for age, ancestry, family history of PCa, and PCa screening history. Results: Subjects with more than 20 sexual partners in their lifetime had a decreased risk of PCa (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61\u20131.00) as did subjects who specifically had more than 20 female sexual partners (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.56\u20130.94). By contrast, having had several male sexual partners appeared to confer some excess in risk of PCa. No association emerged for history of STIs and PCa but STIs prevalence was low. Conclusion: Our findings are in support of a role for the number of sexual partners in PCa development. The gender of sexual partners should be taken into account in future studies investigating this association.",

     "abstract": "Physical activity, a protective factor for breast cancer, increases the level of DNA methylation. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), a confirmed breast cancer susceptibility gene, is predisposed to be methylated. Therefore, DNA methylation related genes, such as methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), methionine synthase (MTR), and DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), together with physical activity and FGFR2, may interact with each other to effect breast cancer risk.A total of 839 incident breast cancer cases and 863 age-matched controls from Guangzhou, China were included in this study. We used questionnaires to assess physical activity in metabolic equivalent (MET)-h/week/year and a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry platform to ascertain genotypes. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from logistic regression models.Exercise activity and FGFR2 rs2981582 were confirmed to be associated with breast cancer risk, and were found to significantly interact (P for multiplicative and additive interactions\u00a0=\u00a00.045 and 0.021, respectively). Women who had CT/TT genotypes of FGFR2 rs2981582 and experienced exercise activity <3 MET-h/week/year had significantly increased risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.15, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.28\u20134.35) compared to women with CC genotype and \u22653 MET-h/week/year. There was also a significant interaction between FGFR2 rs2981582 and MTHFR rs1801133 on breast cancer risk (P for multiplicative and additive interactions\u00a0=\u00a00.039 and 0.023, respectively).We found both a gene\u2013environment (FGFR2-exercise activity) and a gene\u2013gene (FGFR2\u2013MTHFR) interaction on breast cancer risk. Our results suggest that environmental factors, such as physical activity, may be able to counteract genetic susceptibility to breast cancer.",

Within the GBM cohort, each patient recorded as using statins prior to diagnosis (defined as \u22652 redeemed prescriptions) was matched to two statin non-users (<2 redeemed prescriptions) by propensity scores based on age, gender, year of diagnosis, comorbidity, and use of selected drugs. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for all-cause death associated with prediagnostic statin use.A total of 339 GBM patients were included in the analyses. Of these, 325 died during median follow-up of 6.9 months (interquartile range: 3.8\u201313.4 months).

Each subject received gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy. The association between human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) polymorphism G-706C (rs61758845) and therapeutic effect was evaluated. The SNP hENT1 G-706C was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assays.The polymorphic genotype and the allele frequency of hENT1 G-706C was significantly different between chemotherapy responders and non-responders; to be specific, the response rate of patients carrying an hENT1-706 GG allele was higher than that of patients with a GC or CC genotype. Logistic regression analysis showed that having the GC or CC genotypes was associated with a higher risk of being a non-responder compared with having the GG genotype (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.34, 95% CI: 1.14\u20134.80; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

Study periods were categorized into three periods according to the major changes or advances in screening and chemotherapy regimens: (1) Period-1 (1992\u20131995), during which there was no evidence-based recommendation for routine CRC screening and 5-fluorouracil was the mainstay for chemotherapy; (2) Period-2 (1996\u20132000), during which evidences and guidelines supported the use of fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and sigmoidoscopy for routine CRC screening; and (3) Period-3 (2001\u20132009), during which Medicare Program added the full coverage for colonoscopy screening to average-risk individuals, and several newly developed chemotherapy regimens were approved. Outcome variables included the likelihood of being diagnosed at an early stage or with a small tumor size, and improvement in relative survival.Compared to period-1, likelihood of being diagnosed with early stage CRC increased by 20% in period-2 (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.2, 95%CI: 1.1\u20131.2) and 30% in period-3 (1.3, 1.2\u20131.4); and likelihood of being diagnosed with small-size CRC increased by 60% in period-2 and 110% in period-3. Similarly, 5-year overall relative survival increased from 51% in period-1 to 56% in period-2 and 60% in period-3. Increase in survival attributable to migration in stage/size was 9% in period-2 and 20% in period-3, while the remaining survival improvement during period-2 and period-3 were largely attributable to more effective chemotherapy regimens (\u226571.6%) and other treatment factors (\u226425%).Improvements in CRC screening resulted in a migration of CRC toward earlier tumor stage and smaller size, which contributed to \u226420% of survival increase.

Only age \u226465 years was an independent predictor of screening in a multivariate model. Almost two thirds of the patients with cirrhosis were unrecognized prior to the HCC diagnosis. Two hundred and fourteen patients (44%) were non-cirrhotics.Regular HCC surveillance in at-risk populations is virtually not applied in Norway and this may contribute to inferior overall survival. Failure to recognize cirrhosis and a high rate of HCC in non-cirrhotic patients will be limiting factors for the overall effectiveness of a potential surveillance program.",

HPV 16 was the dominant type in all lesions, with contributions in low grade lesions ranging from 16.6%(14.3\u201319.2) in Mexico to 39.8% (30.0\u201350.2) in India, and contributions in high grade lesions ranging from 43.8% (36.3\u201351.4) in Mexico to 64.1% (60.6\u201367.5) in Brazil. After HPV 16, variations in other majors HPV types were observed by country, with an under representation of HPV 18 and 45 compared to ICC.The addition of HPVs 31/33/45/52/58 to HPV types included in current vaccines could increase the ICC preventable fraction in a range of 12 to 19% across the four countries, accounting the 9-types altogether 90% of ICC cases. Assuming the same degree of efficacy of current vaccines, the implementation of the 9-valent HPV vaccine in Brazil, Mexico, India and China would substantially impact on the reduction of the world cervical cancer burden.",

This study examined the prevalence of current depression and the risk factors associated with a high burden of depression among cancer survivors in the US.We analyzed data from 3550 cancer survivors (aged \u226518 years) and 26,917 adults without cancer who participated in the 2010 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 diagnostic algorithm. Participants with a total depression severity score of \u226510 were defined as having current depression. Prevalence and prevalence ratios were estimated by conducting log-linear regression analysis while controlling for potential confounders.Overall, 13.7% of cancer survivors (vs. 8.9% of adults without cancer, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) reported having current depression; the prevalence varied significantly by cancer category. Among cancer survivors, after multivariate adjustment for covariates, cancer diagnosis within a year, being in \u2018other\u2019 racial/ethnic group, divorced, separated, widowed, or never married, current or former smoker, or having histories of diabetes, disability, or depression were associated with significantly higher prevalence ratios for current depression; whereas being at an advanced age (\u226560 years old), attaining educational levels of >high school graduate, or engaging in leisure-time physical activity were associated with significantly lower prevalence ratios for current depression.Our results indicate that cancer survivors are at increased risk of current depression. Targeting cancer survivors at high risk of depressive issues may be especially important for clinical support and interventions aimed at improving mental well-being.",

Cancer chemotherapy causes major side effects and is not effective enough in slowing down the progression of the disease. Earlier studies showed a role for resveratrol in the inhibition of FASN, but the molecular mechanisms of resveratrol-induced inhibition are not known. In the present study, we examined the novel mechanism of resveratrol on Her2-overexpressed breast cancer cells.The effect of resveratrol on the growth of breast cancer cells was assessed as percent cell viability by cytotoxicity-based MTT assay and the induction of apoptosis was determined by cell-death detection ELISA and flow cytometric analysis of Annexin-V\u2013PI binding. Western immunobloting was used to detect signaling events in human breast cancer (SKBR-3) cells.Data showed that resveratrol-mediated down-regulation of FASN and HER2 genes synergistically induced apoptotic death in SKBR-3 cells. This concurrently caused a prominent up-regulation of PEA3, leads to down-regulation of HER2 genes. Resveratrol also alleviated the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling by down-regulation of Akt phosphorylation and up-regulation of PTEN expression.These findings suggest that resveratrol alters the cell cycle progression and induce cell death via FASN inhibition in HER2 positive breast cancer.",

Knowledge of the various aspects of breast cancer in different geographical regions is limited in South Asia. In this article, we review the Bangladeshi perspective of the epidemiology, risk factors, pathology, diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. As in other developing countries, because of the lack of breast cancer awareness in Bangladeshi population and inadequate access to health care, most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease. Early detection has a crucial impact on overall treatment outcomes. To battle against breast cancer in resource-limited countries like Bangladesh, it is not feasible to set up a parallel health service system solely dedicated to cancer. Therefore, a cost-effective public health strategy is needed which could reach a large number of women in the country. Considering all these issues, we propose an innovative female-based primary healthcare approach focused on awareness, screening and early detection of breast cancer in Bangladesh. This preventive strategy could be a model for other resource-limited developing countries.",

Although understanding of genetic and epigenetic changes of childhood leukemia has improved, the causes of childhood leukemia and the potential role of environmental exposures in leukemogenesis remain largely unknown. Although many epidemiologic studies have examined a variety of environmental exposures, ionizing radiation remains the only generally accepted environmental risk factor for childhood leukemia. Among suspected risk factors, infections, exposure to pesticides, and extremely low frequency magnetic fields are notable. While there are well-defined differences between leukemia in children with and without DS, studies of risk factors for leukemia among DS children are generally consistent with trends seen among non-DS (NDS) children.We provide background on DS epidemiology and review the similarities and differences in biological and epidemiologic features of leukemia in children with and without DS. We propose that both acute lymphoblastic and acute myeloblastic leukemia among DS children can serve as an informative model for development of childhood leukemia.

In recent decades, the industrialized countries have witnessed a steady growth of pleural MM (MPM), following a stabilization or decline in rates in the countries that first adopted restrictive policies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the temporal variations of pleural MM incidence in the Veneto Region of Italy in the period 1987\u20132010. Methods We included only MPM with histological or cytological diagnosis. Age-Period-Cohort (APC) models were used to assess the trend in the incidence of MPM in both genders. Future predictions were evaluated by using a Bayesian APC model. Results In the period 1987\u20132010, 1600 MPMs have occurred. We observe a positive trend in the incidence in the whole period considered. The APC model showed that in both genders the cohort at higher risk is the one born between the years 1940\u20131945. Future projections indicate that the trend will decrease after the incidence peak of 2010; yet 1234 men are expected to develop a mesothelioma between 2011 and 2026. Among women, the future MPM rates will be stable or slightly decreasing. Conclusions The asbestos ban introduced in Italy in the year 1992 as a prospective result will certainly determine a decreasing incidence. However, the extremely long latency of MPM means that its influence is not yet observable.",

In Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H), data on human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype distribution among cervical cancer cases is scarce. This baseline information is critical in order to evaluate the impact of prophylactic HPV vaccines. This study aims to provide specific information for B&H.The final analysis comprised 283 cases of invasive cervical cancer identified at the Polyclinic for Laboratory Diagnostic, University Clinical Center Tuzla in B&H between 1984 and 2004. HPV was detected through amplification of HPV DNA using SPF-10 broad spectrum primers followed by deoxyribonucleic acid enzyme inmunoassay and genotyping by reverse line probe assay (LiPA25, version 1).Most cases (92.2%) were histologically classified as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). A total of 268 cases (94.7%) were positive for HPV. Infections were mainly present as single (95.5%) and HPV16 and 18 accounted for 77.8% of the positive cases. The next most common HPV types were HPV45 (4.4%), HPV33 (3.1%), HPV51 (2.3%) and HPV31 (2.2%).

     "abstract": "Introduction: There is a wide range of tumors affecting the orbital adnexa. Key such tumors include lymphomas, carcinomas, melanomas and rhabdomyosarcomas. Several studies have proposed that these histological subtypes differ in their survival outcomes. In this study we aim to describe the difference in survival outcomes between such subtypes. Methods: The SEER database was used to gather patient information. All 18 SEER registries were used. Patients diagnosed from 1996 to 2005 were included in the analysis. Observed five-year survival rate was calculated using the SEER*Stat software version 8.1.2. Data were extracted into IBM SPSS version 20 to generate Kaplan Meier curve for each group. Results: There were 2180 patients in the SEER databases who met the selection criteria. Lymphomas were the most common histology in adults. The overall five-year observed survival for all lymphoma patients was 75.9% (95% CI: 73.7\u201378.1). There was statistically significant difference between observed survival rates of lymphoma subtypes. Carcinomas were the second most common tumors. Their five-year observed survival rate in our study was 60.4%. There was no statistically significant difference between carcinoma subtypes\u2019 observed survival rates in the 20\u201349 age group, while, in the older age group, the difference was found to be statistically significant. Rhabdomyosarcomas were the most common tumors in children. The overall five-year observed survival rate for rhabdomyosarcomas patients was 89.8%. There was no statistically significant difference between observed survival rates of rhabdomyosarcomas subtypes. There was no statistically significant difference between relative survival rates according to gender and treatment received except within melanomas. Conclusion: In adults, lymphomas have better survival rates than carcinomas. Whereas the lymphoma subtype can be used as a determinant prognostic factor in any age, the carcinoma subtype can be used as such a determinant in older age groups only. In children, rhabdomyosarcomas are the predominant tumors affecting the orbital adnexa. Further studies are needed to determine if the difference between embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma observed survival rates are statistically significant.",

Methods: Using a nested case-control study in the General Practice Research Database (GPRD), we estimated the relative risk of myeloid neoplasms, specifically myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in patients with autoimmune disorders compared with patients without autoimmune disorders. Results: We identified 849 cases of MDS and 3417 matched controls.

The elevated odds ratios of MDS were present in both untreated patients and patients who had a record of receiving multiple treatments. Conclusion: There was a modestly increased risk of MDS was in patients with a history of autoimmune disorder. However, it is difficult to determine whether autoimmune disorders increased the risk of MDS, or whether the small elevation in the risk estimate was an artifact of misdiagnosis resulting from early MDS symptoms similar to those of autoimmune disorders.

     "abstract": "Population-based studies of breast cancer often aggregate all Asians into a single category termed Asian/Pacific Islander (API).(1) Describe the demographic and clinicopathologic features of early breast cancer utilizing all eight ER/PR/HER2 subtypes among white, black, Hispanic, American Indian, seven Asian ethnicities, and the aggregate API category; (2) ascertain the risk of the ER+/PR+/HER2+, ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212, and ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2+ subtypes when compared with the ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212 subtype, among seven Asian ethnicities versus non-Hispanic white women and (3) contrast the results with the risk of these same subtypes when using the aggregate API category.Using the California Cancer Registry, we identified 225,441 cases of stages 1\u20134 first primary female invasive breast cancer. Logistic regression was used to assess the association of race with the ER+/PR+/HER2+, ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212 (triple-negative), and the ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2+ subtypes versus the ER+/PR+/HER2\u2212 when adjusted for stage, age, tumor grade, and socioeconomic status. Models were fit separately for each subtype. Odds ratios for the seven Asian ethnicities and the aggregate API category using non-Hispanic white women as the reference category were computed.There was an increased risk of the ER+/PR+/HER2+ subtype for the combined API category (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.16; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09\u20131.23). But only Southeast Asians (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.17; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04\u20131.31), Filipino (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.23; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.12\u20131.36), and Korean (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.63; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.38\u20131.99) women had an increased risk of this subtype. The reduced risk of the triple-negative subtype seen in APIs (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.84; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.79\u20130.90) was only noted in Chinese (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.80; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.70\u20130.91) and Filipino (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.65; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.58\u20130.73) women whereas Indian Continent (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.25; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u20131.53) women had an increased risk of the triple-negative subtype.The race\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0stage interaction was statistically significant for the ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2+ subtype (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). When stratified by stage, there was no statistically significant association of race with subtype in stages 3 and 4. APIs had an increased risk of the ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2+ subtype in stage 1 (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.59; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.37\u20131.75) and stage 2 (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.42; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.28\u20131.58) but this risk was not seen in Pacific Islander, Indian Continent, and Japanese women for either stage.Among the Asian ethnicities, there is marked variability in the demographic and clinicopathologic features of breast cancer. Use of the ER/PR/HER2 subtypes reveals that the risk of the ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2\u2212, ER+/PR+/HER2+, and ER\u2212/PR\u2212/HER2+ subtypes varies among the Asian population.

However, evidences about this point with respect to esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Han Chinese populations remain limited. Our previous study demonstrated that p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism was associated with the risk of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related ESCC. Telomeres and p53 play important roles in maintaining genomic stability and regulating the cell cycle. HPV impacts both telomere length stabilization and p53 degradation. Given the roles of the three factors, we evaluated leukocyte telomere length, p53 variants and HPV-16 serology to examine the potential associations between them and ESCC risk in a case\u2013control study with 308 patients and 309 cancer-free controls matched by age and sex. Compared with long telomere length, short telomere length was significantly associated with an increased risk of ESCC (adjusted OR 2.01; 95% CI 1.41\u20132.80). Moreover, this association was enhanced when combined with HPV-16 seropositivity and p53 Arg/Arg or Arg/Pro genotypes. Notably, individuals with short telomere length, Arg/Pro or Arg/Arg genotypes and HPV-16 seropositivity had a 12.08-fold (95% CI 5.49\u201326.56) increased risk of ESCC compared to those with none of the three investigated risk factors. Taken together, these results indicate that short telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes is a biomarker for ESCC risk, and has statistically additive effects with p53 variants and HPV seropositivity with regard to the risk of ESCC in a Han Chinese population.",

Genome-wide association studies have identified and replicated several loci associated with risk of IBD; however, it is currently unknown whether these loci are also associated with colon cancer risk.We selected 15 validated SNPs associated with risk of either Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or both in previous GWAS and tested whether these loci were also associated with colon cancer risk in a two-stage study design.We found that rs744166 in STAT3 was associated with colon cancer risk in two studies; however, the direction of the observation was reversed in TP53 mutant tumors possibly due to a nullification of the effect by mutant p53. The SNP, which lies within intron 1 of the STAT3 gene, was associated with lower expression of STAT3 mRNA in TP53 wild-type, but not mutant, tumors.These data suggest that the STAT3 locus is associated with both IBD and cancer. Further understanding the function of this variant in relation to TP53 could possibly explain the role of this gene in autoimmunity and cancer. Furthermore, an analysis of this locus, specifically in a population with IBD, could help to resolve the relationship between this SNP and cancer.",

Independent associations with melanoma-specific survival were evaluated through Cox proportional hazards modeling adjusting for age, gender, Breslow thickness, ulceration and the presence of microsatellites. Independently significant variables were then combined into a single model and backwards elimination was employed until all remaining variables were significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.Following adjustment for age, Breslow thickness and anatomic site of the index melanoma, daily fruit consumption was associated with improved melanoma-specific survival (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.54; 95% CI: 0.34\u20130.86) whereas at least weekly red meat consumption was associated with worse outcomes (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.84; 95% CI: 1.02\u20133.30).

The study population was the 295 women, out of 4743 recalled women from a total of 58,003 participants, with a false-positive test during the screening period 1991\u20132005 and who later developed breast cancer.

Women with a false-positive test determined at assessment had an excess risk of 27%, while false-positives determined at surgery had an excess risk of 30%.The results indicate that the increased risk is not explained only by misclassification. The excess risk remains for false-positives determined at assessment as well as at surgery, which favours some biological susceptibility.

WBCR data were treated as the benchmark.Of 2562 cancers, 315(12.3%) were unstaged in the NZCR. For cancers with a known stage in the NZCR, staging accuracy was 94.4%. Lower staging accuracies of 74% and 84% were noted for metastatic and locally invasive (involving skin or chest wall) cancers, respectively, compared with localized (97%) and lymph node positive (94%) cancers. Older age (>80 years), not undergoing therapeutic surgery and higher comorbidity score were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) associated with unstaged cancer. The high proportion of unstaged cancer in the NZCR was noted to have led to an underestimation of the true incidence of metastatic breast cancer by 21%. Underestimation of metastatic cancer was greater for M\u0101ori (29.5%) than for NZ European (20.6%) women. Overall 5-year survival rate for unstaged cancer (NZCR) was 55.9%, which was worse than the 5-year survival rate for regional (77.3%), but better than metastatic (12.9%) disease.Unstaged cancer and accuracy of cancer staging in the NZCR are major sources of bias for the NZCR based research.

We performed a meta-analysis to explore the association between infection caused by Neisseria gonorrheae, Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia trachomatis, Trichomonas vaginalis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Mycoplasma hominis, Herpes Simplex Virus types 1 and 2, Human Herpes Virus 8 and Cytomegalovirus, and PC. We conducted a comprehensive, systematic bibliographic search of medical literature to identify relevant studies. We calculated summary relative risk (SRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between each STI and PC through random effect models. Subgroup, meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were carried out to detect between-study heterogeneity and bias. We included 47 studies published between 1971 and 2011. Men who reported having ever had any STI in lifetime had an increased PC (SRR 1.49, 95% CI 1.19\u20131.92). We found a significantly increased PC risk in men having had gonorrhoea (SRR 1.20, 95% CI 1.05\u20131.37). No other single STI was significantly associated with PC. Due to high incidence of both STIs and PC worldwide, prevention of STIs may help preventing a considerable number of PC cases.",

     "abstract": "The association between alcohol and leukemia risk has been addressed in several studies in the past two decades, but results have been inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the dose\u2013risk relation. Through the literature search up to August 2013, we identified 18 studies, 10 case-control and 8 cohorts, carried out in a total of 7142 leukemia cases. We derived pooled meta-analytic estimates using random-effects models, taking into account the correlation between estimates, and we performed a dose\u2013risk analysis using a class of nonlinear random-effects meta-regression models. Stratified analyses were carried out on leukemia subtypes and groups, in order to identify possible etiologic differences. Compared with nondrinkers, the relative risks (RRs) for all leukemia were 0.94 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.85\u20131.03], 0.90 (95% CI, 0.80\u20131.01) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.81\u20131.02) for any, light (\u22641 drink/day) and moderate to heavy (>1 drink/day) alcohol drinking, respectively. The summary RRs for any alcohol drinking were 1.47 (95% CI, 0.47\u20134.62) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 0.94 (95% CI 0.77\u20131.15) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.86\u20131.21) for acute myeloid leukemia and 0.93 (95% CI 0.75\u20131.14) for chronic myeloid leukemia. The subgroup analysis on geographical area for all leukemia combined showed RRs of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76\u20130.93), 0.92 (95% CI, 0.83\u20131.01) and 1.32 (95% CI, 1.02\u20131.70) for studies conducted in America, Europe and Asia, respectively.

This study aims to explore age disparities with respect to the clinical characteristics of the tumour, diagnostic pathway and treatment of colorectal cancer patients.We conducted a multicenter cross sectional study in 5 Spanish regions. Consecutive incident cases of CRC were identified from pathology services. Measurements: From patient interviews, hospital and primary care clinical records, we collected data on symptoms, stage, doctors investigations, time duration to diagnosis/treatment, quality of care and treatment.777 symptomatic cases, 154 were older than 80 years. Stage was similar by age group. General symptoms were more frequent in the eldest and abdominal symptoms in the youngest. No differences were found regarding perception of symptom seriousness and symptom disclosure between age groups as no longer duration to diagnosis or treatment was observed in the oldest groups. In primary care, only ultrasound is more frequently ordered in those <65 years. Those >80 years had a significantly higher proportion of iron testing and abdominal XR requested in hospital. We observed a high resection rate independently of age but less adjuvant chemotherapy in Stage III colon cancer, and of radiotherapy in stage II and III rectal cancer as age increases.There are no relevant age disparities in the CRC diagnosis process with similar stage, duration to diagnosis, investigations and surgery. However, further improvements have to be made with respect to adjuvant therapy.",

Our objective was to explore several anthropometric characteristics in relation to the risk of melanoma in women.We prospectively analysed data from E3N, a French cohort involving 98,995 women born in 1925\u20131950. Participants completed self-administered questionnaires sent biennially over 1990\u20132008. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed using Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for age, number of naevi, freckling, skin and hair colour, skin sensitivity to sun exposure, residential sun exposure, and physical activity.Height was positively associated with melanoma in age-adjusted models only (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.27, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u20131.55 for \u2265164\u00a0cm vs. <160\u00a0cm; P for trend\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

This spurred several studies on cancer risk among UN peacekeepers who served in the Balkans. Although these studies turned out to be negative, the debate about possible cancers and other health risks caused by DU exposure continues. The aim of the present study was to investigate cancer incidence and all-cause mortality in a cohort of 6076 (4.4% women) Norwegian military UN peacekeepers deployed to Kosovo between 1999 and 2011.The cohort was followed for cancer incidence and mortality from 1999 to 2011. Standardised incidence ratios for cancer (SIR) and mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated from national rates.Sixty-nine cancer cases and 38 deaths were observed during follow-up. Cancer incidence in the cohort was similar to that in the general Norwegian population. No cancers in the overall cohort significantly exceeded incidence rates in the general Norwegian population, but there was an elevated SIR for melanoma of skin in men of 1.90 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95\u20133.40). A fivefold increased incidence of bladder cancer was observed among men who served in Kosovo for \u22651 year, based on 2 excess cases (SIR\u00a0=\u00a05.27; 95% CI 1.09\u201315.4).

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, HPV-16 viral loads were measured using previously-collected and frozen cervical swab samples from 498 HPV-16 positive Senegalese women (368 HIV-seronegative, 126 HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 seropositive). The real-time polymerase chain reaction assay was used to quantify HPV-16 E7 copy number normalized by human cellular DNA (\u03b2-actin), and viral loads were log10 transformed. Associations between HPV-16 viral load, degree of cervical abnormality, and HIV status were assessed using multinomial and linear regression methods. Results: Compared to women with normal cytology, the likelihood of CIN1 (ORa: 1.21, 95% CI 0.93\u20131.57), CIN2-3 (ORa: 2.38, 95% CI 1.72\u20133.29) and cancer (ORa: 2.12, 95% CI 1.52\u20132.96) was found to increase for each 1-unit log10 increase in HPV-16 viral load. Compared to HIV-negative women, HIV-positive women had higher average HPV-16 viral load values (\u03b2a: 0.39, 95% CI 0.03\u20130.75), even after accounting for degree of cervical abnormality. Conclusion: In our study of women including those with cancer, HPV-16 viral load was associated with a higher likelihood of cervical abnormalities. However, substantial overlaps across categories of disease severity existed. Higher viral load among HIV-infected individuals may indicate that HIV infection influences HPV viral replication factors.",

A cohort of 6,479,406 children was followed from birth until either their death or until December 31, 2006. For surrogate measures of pesticide exposure, we used residence at birth, paternal occupation, and month of conception from the birth certificate. Farming and pesticide exposure indexes by county were calculated using information derived from the 2000 agricultural census. Poisson regression analyses were used to calculate rate ratios (RRs) of childhood leukemia deaths according to indices of exposure to agricultural pesticides after adjustment for potential confounders.In total 585 leukemia deaths were observed during the study period. Childhood leukemia mortality was significantly elevated in children born in rural areas (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.43, 95%CI 1.09\u20131.86) compared to those in metropolises, and in counties with both the highest farming index (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95%CI 1.04\u20131.69) and pesticide exposure index (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.30, 95%CI 1.02\u20131.66) compared to those in the reference group. However, exposure\u2013response associations were significant only in relation to the farming index.

The aim of this study was to investigate the synergistical influence of miR-224 and pAKT on clinical characteristics and prognosis in patients with HCC.One-hundred and thirty HCC patients who had undergone curative liver resection were selected. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were respectively performed to detect the expression of miR-224 and pAKT in the respective tumors.Compared with the adjacent nonneoplastic liver tissues, the expression levels of miR-224 and pAKT protein in HCC tissues were both significantly increased (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In addition, the combined upregulation of miR-224 and pAKT protein was significantly associated with serum AFP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), tumor stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and tumor grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Moreover, HCC patients highly expressing both miR-224 and pAKT protein had worse 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Furthermore, the Cox proportional hazards model showed that the combined upregulation of miR-224 and pAKT protein (miR-224-high/pAKT-high) may be independent poor prognostic factors for both 5-year disease-free survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and 5-year overall survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) in HCC.These results indicate for the first time that miR-224 upregulation and AKT activation may synergistically associate with tumor progression of HCC. The combined high expression of miR-224 and pAKT may be a potential indicator for predicting unfavorable prognosis in HCC patients.",

Thus, the aim of this study is to evaluate the potential prognostic value of HORMAD2 polymorphisms in Han Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC and undergoing first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.We selected eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of HORMAD2 with the potential function of affecting the binding of transcription factors, and we genotyped these SNPs in 303 patients with advanced NSCLC using the MassARRAY platform. All patients were treated with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy but without surgery. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used for the survival analyses.Four SNPs at HORMAD2 (rs9620953, rs8135823, rs5753025 and rs9625921) were significantly associated with the survival of advanced NSCLC patients. Among these, patients with the rs9620953 T allele had a significantly reduced risk of death compared to those with the C allele (additive model: HR, 0.53, 95%CI, 0.32\u20130.89, P\u00a0=\u00a00.016; dominant model: HR, 0.50, 95%CI, 0.29\u20130.84, P\u00a0=\u00a00.010). Similarly, the G allele at rs8135823 could decrease the death risk of NSCLC patients compared to the T allele (additive model: HR, 0.63, 95%CI, 0.41\u20130.95, P\u00a0=\u00a00.028; dominant model: HR, 0.60, 95%CI, 0.39\u20130.93, P\u00a0=\u00a00.022). Furthermore, both the rs5753025 C allele and the rs9625921 G allele also decreased the death risk in NSCLC in different genetic models (additive model for rs5753025: HR, 0.80, 95%CI, 0.65\u20130.98, P\u00a0=\u00a00.032; heterozygote model for rs9625921: HR, 0.71, 95%CI, 0.51\u20130.99, P\u00a0=\u00a00.040). In the joint effect analyses, we found that patients with one, two, and three to eight favorable alleles had a better survival compared with patients carrying no alleles.These findings indicate that polymorphisms at the CT gene HORMAD2 might be involved in the prognosis of advanced NSCLC in Han Chinese. Further larger and functional studies are needed to confirm the results.",

     "abstract": "Inconsistent associations of smoking and breast cancer-specific mortality might be explained by subgroups of patients with different susceptibility to harmful effects of smoking.We used a prospective cohort of 3340 postmenopausal breast cancer patients aged 50\u201374 and diagnosed with invasive tumours 2001\u20132005 in Germany, with a median follow-up time of 6 years. The effect of pre-diagnostic smoking behaviour on mortality outcomes and risk of recurrence was investigated using delayed entry Cox regression analysis. Differential effects according to N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) status, BMI, alcohol consumption, and tumour subtypes were assessed.Overall, smoking at time of breast cancer diagnosis versus never/former smoking was non-significantly associated with increased breast cancer-specific mortality and risk of recurrence (HR 1.23, 95% CI 0.93\u20131.64, and HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.95\u20131.75, respectively). Associations were consistently stronger in NAT2 slow than in fast acetylators for all mortality outcomes. Breast cancer-specific mortality was significantly increased in smokers with NAT2 slow acetylating status (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.13\u20132.79) but not in those with fast acetylating status (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.60\u20131.98; Pheterogeneity\u00a0=\u00a00.19). Smoking was associated with significantly poorer outcomes for triple negative and luminal A-like tumours (e.g. all-cause mortality: HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.02\u20133.65, and HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.40\u20133.10, respectively). Risk of recurrence was significantly increased for women with HER2 positive tumours (HR 3.64, 95% CI 1.22\u201310.8). There was significant heterogeneity by BMI for non-breast cancer-specific mortality (<25\u00a0kg/m2: HR 2.52, 95% CI 1.52\u20134.15 vs. \u226525\u00a0kg/m2: HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.38\u20132.36; Pheterogeneity\u00a0=\u00a00.04).The harmful effects of smoking may be particularly relevant for certain subgroups of breast cancer patients. This may include patients with NAT2 slow acetylation status or with tumour subtypes other than luminal B, such as luminal A tumours who usually have a rather good prognosis. Emphasis on smoking cessation programmes for all cancer patients should be strengthened.",

Using a database of women with breast cancer treated at Guy's Hospital, London 1976\u20132006 and followed until end 2010, we determined incidence of and survival after bone metastases. Methods: We calculated cumulative incidence of bone metastases considering death without prior bone metastases as a competing risk. Risk of bone metastases was modelled through Cox-regression. Survival after bone metastases diagnosis was calculated using Kaplan\u2013Meier methodology. Results: Of the 7064 women, 589 (22%) developed bone metastases during 8.4 years (mean). Incidence of bone metastases was significantly higher in younger women, tumour size >5\u00a0cm, higher tumour grade, lobular carcinoma and \u2265four positive nodes, but was not affected by hormone receptor status. Median survival after bone metastases diagnosis was 2.3 years in women with bone-only metastases compared with <1 year in women with visceral and bone metastases. There was a trend for decreased survival for patients who developed visceral metastases early, and proportionately fewer patients in this group. Interpretation: Incidence of bone metastases has decreased but bone metastases remain a highly relevant clinical problem due to the large number of patients being diagnosed with breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is related to colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, with approximately 15% of CRC deaths worldwide attributable to physical inactivity. Moreover, higher levels of PA in CRC survivors have been associated with a reduced risk of the disease recurring. Despite the recognised nexus between PA and the risk of CRC, the physiological mechanisms underlying the inverse relationship between PA and mortality following CRC diagnosis are less apparent, with evidence primarily drawn from epidemiological studies. The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis plays a central role in cellular growth, proliferation regulation, differentiation and apoptosis. Specifically, high levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have been consistently linked to the severity of CRC tumours. Further, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) regulates the bioavailability of IGF-I and therefore plays a central role in CRC prognosis. Decreasing levels of IGF-1 and increasing levels of IGFBP-3 may thus be a plausible mechanism underlying the inverse association between PA and CRC survival.",

     "abstract": "Background: Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is a common cancer yet little is known about the reliability of incidence data. Methods: We audited 574 CUP (C80.9) diagnoses (median age 81 years) registered by the New South Wales (NSW) Central Cancer Registry (2004\u20132007) in a cohort of Australian Government Department of Veterans\u2019 Affairs clients. The registry did not clarify diagnoses with notifiers during this period due to interpretation of privacy legislation. For the audit, current registry practice was applied by seeking additional information from CUP notifiers and reclassifying diagnoses as necessary. In addition, clinicopathological characteristics were extracted from notifications. Fisher's exact test and Student's t-test were used to compare the demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of the CUP subgroups. Age/sex-standardised CUP incidence rates and 95% confidence intervals were calculated, standardised to the 2001 Australian population. Results: 172 (30.0%) cases were reclassified to a known primary site, mostly cutaneous, and nine (1.6%) were found to be non-malignant diagnoses. After the audit the age/sex-standardised CUP incidence rates decreased from 26.0 (95% CI 21.2\u201330.8) to 15.9 (95% CI 12.5\u201319.3) per 100,000 person-years. Of the 393 remaining CUP cases, 202 (51%) were registered on the basis of a clinical diagnosis (46 by death certificate only) and 191 (49%) by pathological diagnosis (79 by cytology alone). Compared to cases with a pathological diagnosis, cases with a clinical diagnosis were older (85.6 vs. 82.0 years, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and the reported number and location of metastases differed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); metastatic sites were more likely to be unspecified for clinical diagnoses (36.1% vs. 4.2%). Conclusions: Cancer registry processes can markedly influence CUP incidence. Future population-based CUP research should take this into account, and consider stratification by basis of diagnosis due to differences in patient and tumour characteristics.",

Both were carried out independently by two reviewers. Relevant data on study characteristics and results were extracted in standardized tables by one reviewer and checked by a second. A meta-analysis was not performed because of clinical and methodological heterogeneity between the studies to avoid misleading results. Data were synthesized in narrative way using a standardized procedure.Twenty-two relevant studies were identified. The study quality was moderate. Especially the risk of bias regarding the measurement of influencing factors and adherence was mostly unclear. Social support, intake of aromatase inhibitors, and lower out-of-pocket costs for OACA seem to have a positive effect on adherence. Depression and the number of different medications seem to have a negative effect on adherence.Low age and very high age seem to be associated with lower adherence.The remaining factors showed either mostly no influence or were heterogeneous regarding the effect direction and statistical significance.There are some factors that seem to have influence on adherence in patients taking OACA. However, due to the heterogeneity no general conclusions can be made also for these factors that can be applied to all indications, medications, settings, countries etc. The results should rather be considered as indications for factors that can have an influence on adherence to OACA.",

Our aim was to describe the epidemiology of CUP in Scotland.Anonymised data, covering the period 1961\u20132010, were extracted from the Scottish Cancer Registry database, based on the following ICD-10 diagnostic codes: C26.0, C26.8, C26.9, C39, and C76\u2013C80. Age-standardised incidence rates were calculated by direct standardisation to the World Standard Population. Estimates of observed survival were calculated by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method.Between 1961 and 2010, there were 50,941 registrations of CUP, representing 3.9% of all registrations of invasive cancers. Age-standardised rates increased to a peak in the early to mid-1990s, followed by a steeper decrease in rates. During 2001\u20132010, age-standardised rates of CUP were higher in the most compared with the least deprived fifth of the population. Observed survival was marginally higher in patients diagnosed during 2001\u20132010 (median 5.6 weeks) compared with those diagnosed in the previous two decades. During the most recent decade, survival decreased with age at diagnosis, and was higher in patients with squamous cell carcinoma and with lymph node metastases.Patterns of CUP in Scotland are largely consistent with those reported from the few other countries that have published data. However, in comparing studies, it is important to note that there is heterogeneity in terms of definition of CUP, as well as calendar period of diagnosis or death. Variation in the definition of CUP between different epidemiological studies suggests that there would be merit in seeking international agreement on guidelines for the registration of CUP as well as a standard grouping of diagnostic codes for analysis.",

The objective of this study was to examine recent survival trends in Estonia and to quantify the effect on survival estimates of the temporary disruption of the Estonian Cancer Registry (ECR) practices in 2001\u20132007 when death certificates could not be used for case ascertainment.ECR data on all adult cases of 16 common cancers diagnosed in Estonia during 1995\u20132008 and followed up for vital status until 2009 were used to estimate relative survival ratios (RSR). We used cohort analysis for patients diagnosed in 1995\u20131999 and 2000\u20132004; and period hybrid approach to obtain the most recent estimates (2005\u20132009). We compared five-year RSRs calculated from data sets with and without death certificate initiated (DCI) cases.A total of 64\u00a0328 cancer cases were included in survival analysis. Compared with 1995\u20131999, five-year age-standardized RSR increased 20 percent units for prostate cancer, reaching 76% in 2005\u20132009. A rise of 10 percent units or more was also seen for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (five-year RSR 51% in 2005\u20132009), and cancers of rectum (49%), breast (73%) and ovary (37%). The effect of including/excluding DCI cases from survival analysis was small except for lung and pancreatic cancers.Relative survival continued to increase in Estonia during the first decade of the 21st century, although for many cancers, a gap between Estonia and more affluent countries still exists.

     "abstract": "Cancer care services including cancer prevention activities are predominantly localised in central cities, potentially causing a heterogeneous geographic access to cancer care. The question of an association between residence in either urban or rural areas and cancer survival has been analysed in other parts of the world with inconsistent results. This study aims at a comparison of age-standardised 5-year survival of cancer patients resident in German urban and rural regions using data from 11 population-based cancer registries covering a population of 33 million people.Patients diagnosed with cancers of the most frequent and of some rare sites in 1997\u20132006 were included in the analyses. Places of residence were assigned to rural and urban areas according to administrative district types of settlement structure. Period analysis and district type specific population life tables were used to calculate overall age-standardised 5-year relative survival estimates for the period 2002\u20132006. Poisson regression models for excess mortality (relative survival) were used to test for statistical significance.The 5-year relative survival estimates varied little among district types for most of the common sites with no consistent trend. Significant differences were found for female breast cancer patients and male malignant melanoma patients resident in city core regions with slightly better survival compared to all other district types, particularly for patients aged 65 years and older.With regard to residence in urban or rural areas, the results of our study indicate that there are no severe differences concerning quality and accessibility of oncological care in Germany among different district types of settlement.",

It is uncertain whether this is related to total body fat or other factors that correlate with body mass index. We aimed to quantify the association between total body fat (measured by bioelectrical impedance) and risk of BO and examine if this association was modified by gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) and abdominal obesity.In 2007\u20132009, we surveyed 235 cases (69% Males, Mean age 62.1 years) and 244 age and sex matched population controls from a population based case\u2013control study of BO. We conducted structured interviews, standard anthropometry and bioimpedance analysis of total body fat. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression analysis.There was a significantly increased risk of BO among those in the highest tertile of total body fat weight (OR 2.01; 95%CI 1.26\u20133.21) and total body fat percentage (OR 1.86; 95%CI 1.10\u20133.15). These risks were largely attenuated after adjustment for GOR and waist circumference. There was a significantly increased risk of BO among those in the highest tertile of waist circumference (OR 2.21; 95%CI 1.39\u20133.51) and this was minimally attenuated after adjustment for total body fat and moderately attenuated after adjustment for GOR.Total body fat is associated with an increased risk of BO but this appears to be mediated via both abdominal obesity and GOR. These findings provide evidence that abdominal obesity is more important than total body fat in the development of BO.",

Its occurrence among blood relatives (familial mesothelioma) may point to genetic susceptibility or shared exposures. The burden of the familial disease is unknown. The aims of the study were to assess at population level the proportion of familial mesotheliomas among all mesotheliomas and to investigate the family history of cancer among relatives of mesothelioma cases. We actively searched familial clusters based on a mesothelioma registry from central Italy (5.5 million people, 10% of the Italian population) of the National Mesothelioma Register network (ReNaM) as well as a pathology-based archive. Among 997 incident mesotheliomas recorded in a 32-year-period (1980\u20132012), we detected 13 clusters and 34 familial cases, accounting for 3.4% of all mesotheliomas.

There were 25 additional cancers in nine families. Some were cancer sites for which there is sufficient evidence (lung and larynx) or limited evidence (stomach and colon) of causal association with asbestos.

It has been reported that androgen receptor (AR), estrogen receptors alpha (ER\u03b1) and beta (ER\u03b2) and their coactivator SRC-1 and SRC-3 are involved in the regulation of the growth and development of many tumors, but their expression profiles and significances in the astrocytic tumors remain largely unknown. In this study, the expression of AR, ERs, and SRCs, and the possible roles of them in astrocytic neoplasm were evaluated and compared to normal brain tissues by nickel-intensified immunohistochemistry with tissue microarrays. The results showed that there were no age- or gender-differences regarding to the levels of these receptors or coactivators in astrocytic or normal brain tissues. In the high-grade astrocytic tissue, the levels of AR, ERs and SRC-3 were significantly decreased when compared to the low-grade astrocytic tissues, but the levels of SRC-1 remain unchanged. Correlation analysis revealed that the levels of AR, ERs and SRC-3 were negatively correlated to tumor differentiation, and the levels of SRC-3 were positively correlated to that of ER\u03b1. Furthermore, the decreased levels of SRC-3 were associated with an increase of ER\u03b2 in astrocytic tumors when compared to that of normal brain tissues. These above results indicate a combination of decreased expression of ERs, AR and SRC-3 but not SRC-1 may be involved in the tumorigenesis of gliomas, ER\u03b1/SRC-3 axis may play central role in the regulation these tumors.",

Population-based cancer registries collect data that enable the estimation of cancer survival. To ensure accurate, consistent and comparable survival estimates, strict control of data quality is required before the survival analyses are carried out. In this paper, we present a basis for data quality control for cancer survival.We propose three distinct phases for the quality control. Firstly, each individual variable within a given record is examined to identify departures from the study protocol; secondly, each record is checked and excluded if it is ineligible or logically incoherent for analysis; lastly, the distributions of key characteristics in the whole dataset are examined for their plausibility.Data for patients diagnosed with bladder cancer in England between 1991 and 2010 are used as an example to aid the interpretation of the differences in data quality. The effect of different aspects of data quality on survival estimates is discussed.We recommend that the results of data quality procedures should be reported together with the findings from survival analysis, to facilitate their interpretation.",

Thus, we propose a systems approach to analyze publicly available large datasets to identify candidate agents that play a role in organ-specific carcinogenesis.Publicly available datasets for mRNA and miRNA expression in ovarian cancer were queried to define the differentially expressed genes that are also targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. These target genes were then used to query the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database to identify interacting chemicals and also were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to identify pathways.The interacting chemicals interact with genes in known pathways in ovarian carcinogenesis and support the hypothesis that these chemicals are likely etiologic agents in ovarian carcinogenesis.A systems approach may prove useful to identify specific etiologic agents to better develop personalized preventive medicine strategies for those most at risk.",

Methods: The 50 largest cities in the U.S. were the units of analysis. Numerator data were abstracted from national death files where the cause was malignant neoplasm of the breast (ICD-9\u00a0=\u00a0174 and ICD-10\u00a0=\u00a0C50) for women. Population-based denominators were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau for 1990, 2000, and 2010. To measure the racial disparity, we calculated non-Hispanic Black:non-Hispanic White rate ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals for each 5-year period. Results: At the final time point (2005\u20132009), two RRs were less than 1, but neither significantly so, while 39 RRs were >1, 23 of them significantly so. Of the 41 cities included in the analysis, 35 saw an increase in the Black:White RR between 1990\u20131994 and 2005\u20132009. In many of the cities, the increase in the disparity occurred because White rates improved substantially over the 20-year study period, while Black rates did not. There were 1710 excess Black deaths annually due to this disparity in breast cancer mortality, for an average of about 5 each day. Conclusion: This analysis revealed large and growing disparities in Black:White breast cancer mortality in the U.S. and many of its largest cities during the period 1990\u20132009. Much work remains to achieve equality in breast cancer mortality outcomes.",

     "abstract": "Individuals co-infected with Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) are at greatly increased risk of developing Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). The objective of the current analysis is to identify risk cofactors for KS among HIV-positive individuals.We conducted a case-control study of KS in Cameroon on 161 HIV-positive and 14 HIV-negative cases and 680 HIV-positive and 322 HIV-negative controls. Participants answered a physician-administered questionnaire and provided blood and saliva specimens. Antibodies against KSHV lytic, K8.1, and latent, ORF73, antigens were measured by ELISA to determine KSHV serostatus. Conditional logistic regression was performed to determine multivariate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk factors associated with KS among HIV-positive cases and controls.Overall, 98% (158) of HIV-positive cases, 100% (14) of HIV-negative cases, 81% (550) of HIV-positive controls, and 80% (257) of HIV-negative controls were KSHV seropositive. Risk factors for KS among HIV-positive individuals included KSHV seropositivity (OR\u00a0=\u00a09.6; 95% CI 2.9, 31.5), non-use of a mosquito bed net (OR 1.9; 95% CI 1.2, 2.9), minority ethnicity (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.1; 95% CI 1.1, 9.3), treatment from a traditional healer (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.3; 95% CI 1.5, 3.7), history of transfusion (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.4; 95% CI 1.5, 3.9), and family history of cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.9; 95% CI 1.1, 3.1).KSHV seroprevalence of \u226580% indicates a high prevalence in the general population in Cameroon. Among HIV-positive individuals, the strong association of KS with non-use of mosquito nets and treatment from traditional healers are compelling findings, consistent with recently reported data from East Africa.",

A random subcohort of 850 subjects was obtained and 286 colorectal cancer cases were diagnosed. Triglycerides, total and HDL cholesterol were determined in plasma samples obtained at baseline and stored at \u2212196\u00a0\u00b0C; LDL cholesterol was calculated. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for potential confounders, were estimated by Cox regression models using the Prentice method.The highest tertiles of total (HR 1.66, 95%CI 1.12\u20132.45) and LDL cholesterol (HR 1.87, 95%CI 1.27\u20132.76) were associated with increased colorectal cancer risk compared to lowest tertiles. Risks were greater for men than women, and for postmenopausal than premenopausal women. Highest tertiles of total and LDL cholesterol were also significantly associated with increased risks of colon cancer, distal colon cancer, and rectal cancer, but not proximal colon cancer.Our findings suggest that high levels of total and LDL cholesterol increase colorectal cancer risk, particularly in men and postmenopausal women. However additional studies are needed to clarify the role of plasma lipids in these cancers, particularly in view of the conflicting findings of previous studies.",

     "abstract": "As a member of the microRNA (miR)-200 family, miR-200b has been recognized as one of the fundamental regulators of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, chemosensitivity, cell proliferation, and cell cycle. Especially in glioma, miR-200b targets the CREB1 gene and suppresses the tumor cell growth in vitro. However, its involvement in human glioma has not yet been determined. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of miR-200b expression in this disease.miR-200b expression in 266 pairs of human gliomas and matched nonneoplastic brain tissues was measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay.Compared with nonneoplastic brain tissues, the expression level of miR-200b was significantly decreased in glioma tissues (tumor vs. normal: 2.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.05 vs. 8.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.50, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Of 266 patients with gliomas, 166 (62.41%) were in low miR-200b expression group. In addition, we found that the glioma tissues from high-grade tumors (grade III and IV) had much lower miR-200b expression than glioma tissues from low grade tumors (grade I and II). Moreover, the expression level of miR-200b was positively correlated with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores of glioma tissues. The results of a 60-month follow-up in 266 glioma patients further demonstrated that lower miR-200b expression was correlated with worse progression-free survival and overall survival in the patients with grade III and IV gliomas. Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that miR-200b was an independent prognostic indicator for glioma.These findings prove that the decreased expression of miR-200b may be associated with malignant tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with gliomas, suggesting the potential role of miR-200b in glioma management. miR-200b may be a novel and valuable signature for predicting the clinical outcome of patients with gliomas.",

The probability of recurrence and progression at 1 year and 5 years post-operatively was calculated along with the 95% confidence intervals.

Physician-collected samples from lower vagina, upper vagina, cervix, and one self-collected sample were taken from each woman. Viral load was assessed by HC2 using the relative light unit/cutoff ratio (RLU/CO), and HPV genotyping was tested by Linear Array.The low risk HPV positive rate was highest in lower vagina samples and lowest in cervix samples. Overall kappa values of high risk HPV types between various anatomic sampling sites showed substantial or almost perfect agreement among women with normal pathology, CIN1, and CIN2+. In the CIN2+ population, high risk HPV viral load for cervix samples (557.25\u00a0RLU/CO) were much higher than upper vagina samples (96.43\u00a0RLU/CO, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), lower vagina samples (36.51\u00a0RLU/CO, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and self-collected (206.83\u00a0RLU/CO, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) samples.Although the distribution of high risk HPV genotypes was fairly equivalent across different genital sites, particularly for CIN2+ lesions, viral loads were largely variable.

The algorithm also provides for the incidence process to be marked with the values of subject level covariates, facilitating calculation of the distribution of these variables in prevalent cases.Disease incidence is modelled as a marked stochastic process and simulations are made from this process. For each simulated incident case, the probability of remaining in the prevalent sub-population is calculated from bootstrapped survival curves. This algorithm is used to determine the distribution of prevalence estimates and of the ancillary data associated with the marks of the incidence process. This is then used to determine prevalence estimates and estimates of the precision of these estimates, together with estimates of the distribution of ancillary variables in the prevalent sub-population. This technique is illustrated by determining the prevalence of acute myeloid leukaemia from data held in the Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN). In addition, the precision of these estimates is determined and the age distribution of prevalent cases diagnosed within twenty years of the prevalence index date is calculated.Determining prevalence estimates by using Monte-Carlo simulation techniques provides a means of calculation more flexible that traditional techniques. In addition to automatically providing precision estimates for the prevalence estimates, the distribution of any measured subject level variables can be calculated for the prevalent sub-population. Temporal changes in incidence and in survival offer no difficulties for the method.",

Here, we used Rasch analysis to assess unidimensionality and identify measurement biases of malignancy scores.The Weiss histopathological system (WHS), summing nine items of histopathological alteration, was used to evaluate 247 adrenocortical tumors. Rasch model analysis was implemented and compared to classical factor analytic methods to investigate the validity of item-score summation for both the original and modified WHS, to assess differential functioning of the WHS items across various factors related to patient and tumors, and to identify items or subtypes of tumors that could be considered for removal or exclusion from the WHS with the aims of improving measurement and relieving the burden on pathologists.The WHS does not meet the necessary property of unidimensionality and is severely affected by differential item functioning in relation to size and weight of the tumor. Moreover, items are not well distributed along the spectrum of malignancy, most being located in the upper part and several at the same place.The WHS in its present form should be applied only to small or moderate size tumors, and better scoring systems could be developed by using more appropriately distributed items. Rasch analysis is a powerful method for developing, evaluating, refining and simplifying malignancy scores.",

This meta-analysis is the first to be performed to determine the relationship between reproductive factors and breast cancer risk among BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. We searched the PubMed database up to February 2013. A total of ten studies met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that the reproductive factors may be associated with breast cancer risk only among BRCA1 mutation carriers. No association was found between parity and breast cancer risk. Compared with women at the youngest age in the first-birth category, women in the oldest age category were at a 38% lower risk of breast cancer (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.62, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.45\u20130.85).

However, the 5-year relative survival remained poor in patients with metastatic cancers at diagnosis, particularly in case of liver, pancreatic, lung, and oesophageal cancer.The cancer-specific outcomes in the Czech Republic are improving. Nevertheless, despite the overall significant improvement in 5-year relative survival of most of the cancer diagnoses, the high proportion of patients primarily diagnosed with metastatic cancer still represents a substantial challenge for prevention and early detection.",

     "abstract": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare malignancy associated with exposure to asbestos. The protracted latent period of MPM means that its incidence has continued to rise across Europe after the introduction of restrictions on asbestos use. In order to obtain a clearer indication of trends in the Republic of Ireland (ROI), incidence and survival were assessed based on all MPM cases reported since the establishment of the National Cancer Registry of Ireland (NCR).NCR recorded 337 MPM diagnoses in the ROI during 1994\u20132009. Survival was assessed for all cases diagnosed with adequate follow-up (n\u00a0=\u00a0330). Crude and European age-standardized incidence rates were calculated for all cases and for 4-year periods. A Cox model of observed (all-cause) survival was used to generate hazard ratios for the effect of: gender; age at diagnosis; diagnosis cohort; region of residence; histological type; and tumour stage. Single P-values for the variables indicated were calculated using either a stratified log-rank test or stratified trend test.Over the study period the age-standardized MPM incidence in the ROI rose from 4.98\u00a0cases per million (cpm) to 7.24\u00a0cpm. The 1-year survival rate for all MPM cases was 29.6% (CI 24.7\u201334.6%). Excess mortality risk was associated with age at diagnosis (75\u201389 yrs vs. 55\u201364 yrs, HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.35\u20132.63, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and tumour stage (III vs. I HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.00\u20132.48, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; IV vs. I HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.08\u20132.21, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Age showed a significant survival trend (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but tumour stage did not (P\u00a0=\u00a00.150). There was significant heterogeneity between the survival of patients resident in different regions (P\u00a0=\u00a00.027).MPM incidence and mortality continued to rise in the ROI after the restrictions on asbestos use and the predictors of survival detected in this study are broadly consistent with those identified for other countries.",

Therefore, we examined the association between statin use and risk of PCa in a Denmark-based case-control study. Materials and methods: We identified 42,480 patients diagnosed with incident PCa during 1997\u20132010 from a national cancer registry. Five age-matched population controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0212,400) were selected for each case using risk-set sampling. Statin use from 1996 to the index date was obtained from the National Prescription Registry. Odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for age, comorbidity, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and educational level for PCa associated with statin use, were computed using conditional logistic regression. Analyses were stratified by duration of statin use (0\u20131, 2\u20134, 5\u20139, or \u226510 years), stage of PCa (localized or advanced), and type of statin used (lipophilic or hydrophilic). Results: In total, 7915 patients (19%) and 39,384 controls (19%) redeemed statin prescriptions prior to the index date. Overall, statin users had a 6% lower risk of PCa compared with non-users [adjusted OR (ORa), 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.91\u20130.97]. Risk estimates did not differ substantially by duration or type of statin used. Slightly larger statin use-associated risk reductions were observed for advanced PCa (ORa, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85\u20130.96) and with statin use \u226510 years (ORa, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65\u20130.95).

Limited evidence suggests that community-acquired infections may increase the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). However, associations with other myeloid malignancies including chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are unknown. Materials and methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER)-Medicare database, fourteen community-acquired infections were compared between myeloid malignancy patients [AML (n\u00a0=\u00a08489), CML (n\u00a0=\u00a03626) diagnosed 1992\u20132005; MDS (n\u00a0=\u00a03072) and MPNs (n\u00a0=\u00a02001) diagnosed 2001\u20132005; and controls (200,000 for AML/CML and 97,681 for MDS/MPN]. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for gender, age and year of selection excluding infections diagnosed in the 13-month period prior to selection to reduce reverse causality. Results: Risk of AML and MDS respectively, were significantly associated with respiratory tract infections, bronchitis (ORs 1.20 [95% CI: 1.14\u20131.26], 1.25 [95% CI: 1.16\u20131.36]), influenza (ORs 1.16 [95% CI: 1.07\u20131.25], 1.29 [95% CI: 1.16\u20131.44]), pharyngitis (ORs 1.13 [95% CI: 1.06\u20131.21], 1.22 [95% CI: 1.11\u20131.35]), pneumonia (ORs 1.28 [95% CI: 1.21\u20131.36], 1.52 [95% CI: 1.40\u20131.66]), sinusitis (ORs 1.23 [95% CI: 1.16\u20131.30], 1.25 [95% CI: 1.15\u20131.36]) as was cystitis (ORs 1.13 [95% CI: 1.07\u20131.18], 1.26 [95% CI: 1.17\u20131.36]).

Some of these loci have unknown functional significance and may mediate the effects of hormonal exposures on breast cancer risk. We examined relationships between breast cancer susceptibility variants and menstrual/reproductive factors using data from two population-based studies. Methods: The first analysis was based on a sample of 1328 women age 20\u201374 who participated as controls in a case\u2013control study of breast cancer conducted in three U.S. states. We evaluated the associations between age at menarche, age at natural menopause and the reproductive lifespan with 13 previously identified breast cancer variants. Associations were also examined with a genetic score created as the sum of at-risk alleles across the 13 variants. For validation, significant results were evaluated in a second dataset comprised 1353 women age 43\u201386 recruited as part of a cohort study in Wisconsin. Results: Neither the genetic score nor any of the 13 variants considered individually were associated with age at menarche or reproductive lifespan. Two SNPs were associated with age at natural menopause; every increase in the minor allele (A) of rs17468277 (CASP8) was associated with a 1.12 year decrease in menopause age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). The minor allele (G) of rs10941679 (5p12) was associated with a 1.01 year increase in age at natural menopause (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The results were not replicated in the validation cohort (B\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.61, p\u00a0=\u00a00.14 and B\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.01, p\u00a0=\u00a0.0.98, respectively).

However, the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in this GWAS, rs2352028, has yielded controversial results. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between rs2352028 and LCINS. Considering that rs2352028 might be largely marker-SNP correlated to causative variants, two predicted functional SNPs, rs3759452 and rs7322083, were additionally investigated in this study. Methods: A hospital based case\u2013control study including 298 cases and 599 controls in a never-smoking Chinese Han population was conducted, and then a meta-analysis combining our data and published data was performed to verify the findings. Results: The SNP rs3759452, predicted to potentially change transcription factor binding site of GPC5, was significantly associated with LCINS risk (odds ratio for dominant model\u00a0=\u00a01.55, 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a01.14\u20132.12). Nevertheless, no significant evidence was showed for rs2352028, both in our case\u2013control study and the meta-analysis including 13 studies of 2342 LCINS cases and 13,398 never-smoking controls. Further subgroup meta-analysis according to population ethnicity and cancer histology also reported no significant association of rs2352028. Conclusions: The association conferring rs3759452 further supports the value of GPC5 in susceptibility to LCINS. Nevertheless, comprehensive analyses are warranted to dissect the functional mechanism underpinning rs3759452.",

Recent work, however, has called into question the overall benefit of radiation for tumors with lower risk characteristics, particularly T3N0 rectal cancers. We retrospectively analyzed T3N0 rectal cancer patients and examined how outcomes differed according to the sequence of treatment received. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to analyze T3N0 rectal cancer cases diagnosed between 1998 and 2008. Treatment consisted of surgery alone (No RT), preoperative radiation followed by surgery (Neo-Adjuvant RT), or surgery followed by postoperative radiation (Adjuvant RT). Demographic and tumor characteristics of the three groups were compared using t-tests for the comparison of means. Survival information from the SEER database was utilized to estimate cause-specific survival (CSS) and to generate Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves. Multivariate analysis (MVA) of features associated with outcomes was conducted using Cox proportional hazards regression models with Adjuvant RT, Neo-Adjuvant RT, No RT, histological grade, tumor size, year of diagnosis, and demographic characteristics as covariates. Results: 10-Year CSS estimates were 66.1% (95% CI 62.3\u201369.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), 73.5% (95% CI 68.9\u201377.5%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), and 76.1% (95% CI 72.4\u201379.4%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), for No RT, Neo-Adjuvant RT, and Adjuvant RT, respectively. On MVA, Adjuvant RT (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.688; 95% CI, 0.578\u20130.819; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) was associated with significantly decreased risk for cancer death. By contrast, Neo-Adjuvant RT was not significantly associated with improved cancer survival (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.863; 95% CI, 0.715\u20131.043; P\u00a0=\u00a00.127). Conclusion: Adjuvant RT was associated with significantly higher CSS when compared with surgery alone, while the benefit of Neo-Adjuvant RT was not significant. This indicates that surgery followed by Adjuvant RT may still be an important treatment plan for T3N0 rectal cancer with potentially significant survival advantages over other treatment sequences.",

A linked national pharmacy claims database was used to determine exposure to anti-diabetic medications prior to diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between metformin use (versus non-metformin anti-diabetic drugs) and odds of presenting with disseminated disease (lymph node positive/metastatic). Analyses were stratified by anti-diabetic drug co-prescription and intensity of metformin exposure.The study population included 241 metformin-exposed diabetics, 129 non-metformin-exposed diabetics, and 4277 non-diabetic patients. In multivariate analysis, odds of disseminated disease were lower in metformin-exposed diabetics, compared with non-metformin-exposed diabetics, though not statistically significant (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.66, 95% CI 0.39\u20131.12). In analyses stratified by metformin dosing intensity and anti-diabetic drug co-prescription, the odds were further from unity and approached significance in diabetics with high intensity, exclusive metformin use (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.52, 95% CI 0.25\u20131.10).While overall there was no statistically significant association between metformin exposure and disseminated colorectal cancer at diagnosis, there was a suggestion that high intensity, exclusive metformin use may be associated with reduced odds of disseminated disease. The number of patients in these subgroup analyses was small, and further investigation in larger studies is warranted.",

The mRNA and protein levels of IL6R gene were found to be down-regulated in the RKO and Hela cells transfected with miR-451 mimics. Consequently, the cell proliferation was inhibited. Also, the invasion of RKO cells was suppressed. Furthermore, the angiogenesis of HUVEC cells transfected with miR-451 mimics was assayed and the decreased angiogenic ability was detected compared to the controls. All these results were validated by IL6R siRNA experiments. The IL6R gene is a target gene of miR-451. The miR-451 behaves as a tumor suppressor, probably by targeting the IL6R pathway.",

We used flexible parametric cure models to estimate cure proportions and median survival times (MSTs) of uncured by stage, sex, age and anatomical site.Disease stage at diagnosis was the most important factor for the probability of cure, with a cure proportion of approximately 1.0 for stage IA. While the probability of cure decreased with older age, the influence of age was smaller on the MST of uncured. Differences in prognosis between males and females were mainly attributed to differences in cure as opposed to differences in MST of uncured.This population-based study showed approximately 100% cure among stage IA disease. Almost 50% of patients had stage IA disease and the high cure proportion for this large patient group is reassuring.",

     "abstract": "Background: The concept of delay in cancer diagnosis has been a scientific issue for decades, and there is still no standardised and validated way to measure the time intervals. One of the intervals that are difficult to measure is the patient interval (i.e. the period from the patient's first symptom until the first presentation to the health care system) because dates of symptom onset and first presentation are difficult to establish precisely. Further, since patients may have another experience of the diagnostic pathway than e.g. the general practitioner (GP), a reasonable question remains whether patients and GPs agree on these important milestones. The objective of this study was to analyse the agreement between patient-reported and GP-reported patient intervals and date of first presentation of cancer-related symptom(s) to the GP. Methods: On the basis of a cohort study, we included incident cancer patients from the former Aarhus County from 1 September, 2004 to 31 August, 2005. Both patients and GPs reported the length of the patient interval and the date of the first presentation to the GP with a cancer-related symptom measured by self-administered questionnaires. Agreement was measured using agreement-survival plots and Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). Results: There was full agreement between GP- and patient-reported patient intervals in 21.0% of all the cancer cases. In 50.1% of cases, patients and GPs agreed about the patient interval within a margin of one month. There was full agreement between GP- and patient-reported date of first presentation in 37.5% of the cancer cases and within one week in 52.0% of all the cancer cases. Overall, the agreement on the length of the patient interval was poor (CCC\u00a0=\u00a00.513), but better for patients presenting with alarm symptoms. The agreement was moderate between GP- and patient-reported dates of first presentation (CCC\u00a0=\u00a00.924). Conclusion: We found that GPs systematically reported a longer patient interval than patients did. We found moderate agreement on reported date of first presentation of symptoms to the GP, meaning that the disagreement in reported patient interval is related to date of first symptom rather than date of first presentation to the GP.",

Sinonasal tumours are relatively rare, but they have the second highest occupational attributable fraction of all types of cancer, with a well-established link for workers exposed to wood dust. Methods: Data for a variety of countries, mainly in Europe, North America and the Asia-Pacific region, were obtained from publicly accessible sources and supplemented with information requested from selected cancer registries. Rates were directly age-standardised to the World Health Organization Standard Population. Results: The average annual incidence of sinonasal cancer was typically between 5 and 10 per million in males and between 2 and 5 per million in females between 2004 and 2008. Denmark reported the highest rates, with incidence continuing to increase, in contrast to trends in other countries which either remained relatively stable, or were decreasing slightly. There were significant recent decreases in sinonasal cancer mortality rates within two-thirds of the included countries. Conclusions: Our observations are generally consistent with efforts to limit exposure to wood dust and other potentially causal substances in the workplace, as well as a reduction in the prevalence of smoking in many developed countries. Of concern is that occupational and behavioural risks related to sinonasal cancer are likely to increase among people in less developed countries into the future. However the incentive to intervene in these countries is limited by the lack of accurate and reliable cancer data.",

The expected numbers were obtained by applying 1987 age\u2013sex specific rates (average of 1986\u20131988) directly to the 2007 population. The observed numbers of deaths and incident cases were calculated for 2007 (average of 2006\u20132008). We limited the analyses to people aged less than 75 years.There was a 28% fall in cancer mortality (7827 fewer deaths in 2007 vs. 1987) and a 21% increase in new cancer diagnoses (13,012 more diagnosed cases in 2007). The greatest reductions in deaths were for cancers of the lung in males (\u22122259), bowel (\u22121797), breast (\u2212773) and stomach (\u2212577). Other notable falls were for cancers of the prostate (\u2212295), cervix (\u2212242) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (\u2212240). Only small or no changes occurred in mortality for cancers of the lung (female only), pancreas, brain and related, oesophagus and thyroid, with an increase in liver cancer (267). Cancer types that showed the greatest increase in incident cases were cancers of the prostate (10,245), breast (2736), other cancers (1353), melanoma (1138) and thyroid (1107), while falls were seen for cancers of the lung (\u22121705), bladder (\u22121110) and unknown primary (\u2212904).The reduction in mortality indicates that prevention strategies, improvements in cancer treatment, and screening programmes have made significant contributions to cancer control in Australia since 1987. The rise in incidence is partly due to diagnoses being brought forward by technological improvements and increased coverage of screening and early diagnostic testing.",

     "abstract": "Background: Despite the considerable epidemiological relevance of cancer in developing countries, there are very few studies of the burden related to cancer. The aim of this study was to present and discuss data from a burden-of-cancer study performed in a Southern Brazilian state. Methods: An epidemiological study of ecological design was performed to calculate the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) index. The study was based on records of individuals admitted and treated for cancer in the Brazilian National Health System Hospitals, or individuals who had died of cancer while residing in the state of Santa Catarina in 2008. Results: A total of 73,872.9 DALYs were estimated, which generated a rate of 1220.5 DALYs/100,000 inhabitants. The highest DALYs were those for cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung with 179.0/100,000 inhabitants, gastric cancer with 101.7/100,000 inhabitants, and breast cancer with 99.7/100,000 inhabitants. The percentage contribution of the DALY component varied according to cancer type; however, mortality was the major component in all types. The highest rates were observed in 60\u201369-year-olds with 6071.3/100,000 inhabitants, in 70\u201379-year-olds with 5095.4/100,000 inhabitants, and in 45\u201359-year-olds with 3189.0 DALY/100,000 inhabitants; 53.7% of DALYs occurred in males. Conclusions: The greatest burden of disease due to cancer in Santa Catarina was attributed to cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung, followed by gastric and breast cancers. The mortality component was responsible for the greatest burden.",

Different races can have different etiology, presentation, and progression patterns. Methods: Data were analyzed on NPC patients in the United States reported to the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) database between 1973 and 2009. Racial groups studied included non-Hispanic whites, Hispanic whites, blacks, Asians, and others. Patient characteristics, age-adjusted incidence and mortality rates, treatment, and five-year relative survival rates were compared across races. Stratification by stage at diagnosis and histologic type was considered. Multivariate regression was conducted to evaluate the significance of racial differences. Results: Patient characteristics that were significantly different across races included age at diagnosis, histologic type, in situ/malignant tumors in lifetime, stage, grade, and regional nodes positive. Incidence and mortality rates were significantly different across races, with Asians having the highest rates overall and stratified by age and/or histologic type. Asians also had the highest rate of receiving radiation only. The racial differences in treatment were significant in the multivariate stratified analysis. When stratified by stage and histologic type, Asians had the best five-year survival rates. The survival experience of other races depended on stage and type. In the multivariate analysis, the racial differences were significant. Conclusions: Analysis of the SEER data shows that racial differences exist among NPC patients in the U.S. This result can be informative to cancer epidemiologists and clinicians.",

     "abstract": "Cancer in children is increasingly recognized as a major and growing health problem in different developed and developing countries. In Yemen, it is still difficult to know the extent of cancer and its determinants among children. This study was conducted to determine the magnitude of childhood cancer in Aden and provide the preliminary baseline data by age and sex.Basic epidemiologic data was retrieved from all paediatric cancer <15 years age registered in Aden Caner Registry (ACR), Yemen, from 1997 to 2006.The results showed a total of 483 childhood cancers <15 years age comprising12.7% of all registered malignancies with a male to female ratio of 1.5:1. The predominant age affected was 5\u20139 years in (38.3%) children. The most frequent cancer among Yemeni children was leukaemia 160 (33.1%) followed by lymphoma 152 (31.5%), CNS tumors 35 (7.2%) and bone tumours 25 (5.2%). An interesting and unusual finding was the frequency of acute myeloid leukaemia twice more common in female (66.7%) than male (33.3%). Lymphoma was the most common cancer in children >5 years. An interesting comparison was the preponderance of non-Hodgkins's lymphoma over Hodgkin's disease (1.6:1) stronger in female (3:1) than male (1.25:1). Medulloblastoma was the most common CNS tumour followed by astrocytoma, an infrequent finding in childhood cancer. Osteosarcoma was the most frequent bone tumour (male:female ratio of 1.8:1). A female preponderance was noticed in chondrosarcoma that was not yet documented. The blastoma group was common in younger age group. Retinoblastoma and nephroblastoma predominated in female while neuroblastoma, hepatoblastoma and soft tissue sarcomas in male.It is concluded that there is a lower frequency of childhood cancer in Aden when compared with developed countries. It may explained by the fact that a large number of childhood cancers remain undiagnosed due to limitations of diagnostic facilities or under registration. Central paediatric hospitals should be provided with essential diagnostic and therapeutic services that should be freely available to all children with cancer.",

Cases were identified from hospitalization registry. Patient characteristics were collected from medical files. Archived anal squamous cancer specimens were available from 96 patients and were tested for HPV DNA and typing. Variant analysis was performed on 16 consecutive and 24 non-consecutive HPV16-positive samples to assess potential contamination during amplification.Among the 606 patients with anal cancers, 366 (60%) were women. Median age at diagnosis was 63 years. HPV was detected in 88/96 (92%) of cases. HPV16 was the most frequent type detected in 90% of HPV-positive specimens. Other types including 6, 11, 18, 33, 52, 53, 56, 58, 62 and 82 were also found. HPV 97 was not detected. HPV prevalence was associated with female gender and younger age. No contamination occurred during amplification as shown by the subset of 41 HPV16-positive samples, as 37, 2 and 1 isolates were from the European, African and Asian lineages, respectively. The most frequent variants were G1 (n\u00a0=\u00a022) and the prototype (n\u00a0=\u00a012).Women with anal cancer are at higher risk for anal HPV infection, and HPV infection, especially HPV16, is strongly associated with squamous anal cancer.

Determining whether the incidence of HPV-associated OPC is rising informs health policy. Methods HPV status was ascribed using p16 immunohistochemistry in 683/1474 OPC patients identified from the Princess Margaret Hospital's Cancer Registry (from 2000 to 2010). Missing p16 data was estimated using multiple (n\u00a0=\u00a0100) imputation (MI) and validated using an independent OPC cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0214). Non-OPC head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (n\u00a0=\u00a03262) were also used for time-trend comparison. Regression was used to compare HNSCC subsets and time-trends. The c-index was used to measure the predictive ability of MI. Results The incidence of OPC rose from 23.3% of all HNSCC in 2000 to 31.2% in 2010 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). In the subset of OPC tested for p16, there was no change in p16 positivity over time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.9). However, p16 testing became more frequent over time (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but was nonetheless biased, favouring never-smokers [OR 1.87 (95% CI 1.29\u20132.70)] and tumors of the tonsil [OR 2.30 (1.52\u20133.47)] or base-of-tongue [OR 1.72 (1.10\u20132.70)]. These same factors were also associated with p16-positivity [ORs 3.22 (1.27\u20138.16), 7.26 (3.50\u201315.1), 5.83 (2.70\u201312.7), respectively]. Following MI and normalization, the proportion of OPC that was p16-associated rose from 39.8% in 2000 to 65.0% in 2010, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002, fully explaining the rise in OPC in our patient population. Conclusion The rise in HNSCC referrals seen from 2000 to 2010 at our institution was driven primarily by p16-associated OPC. MI was necessary to derive reliable conclusions when cases with missing data are considerable.",

We used standardised rate ratios to test whether incidence was associated with socio-demographic variables and used Joinpoint to examine trends by morphology grouping.Incidence of cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3) rose over the period 1994\u20132008. The annual percentage change for cervical cancer was 1.8% and that for CIN3 was 3.8%. Women resident in the most deprived areas had invasive cervical cancer incidence almost twice as high as those resident in the least deprived areas (standardised rate ratio (SRR)\u00a0=\u00a01.8). Comparing incidence in Ireland to England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland in the three years 2005\u20132007, the SRRs (other areas vs. Ireland) were 0.70, 0.88 and 0.84 respectively. Cervical cancer rates have fallen in these countries in the same period that there is a rise demonstrated in Ireland.Incidence rates of cervical cancer rose in Ireland steadily, albeit modestly, during 1994\u20132008, most likely due to long-term changes in patterns of sexual behaviour and contraceptive use. A more pronounced rise in CIN3 rates point to considerable levels of opportunistic screening during this period. Mortality rates have changed little over the past four decades, in contrast to trends in countries with well-organised screening programmes.",

In this study, we compared five commonly used approaches for modelling cure in a relative survival framework and provide some practical advice on the use of these approaches.Data for colon, female breast, and ovarian cancers were used to illustrate these approaches. The proportion cured was estimated for each of these three cancers within each of three age groups. We then graphically assessed the assumption of cure and the model fit, by comparing the predicted relative survival from the cure models to empirical life table estimates.Where both cure and distributional assumptions are appropriate (e.g., for colon or ovarian cancer patients aged <75 years), all five approaches led to similar estimates of the proportion cured. The estimates varied slightly when cure was a reasonable assumption but the distributional assumption was not (e.g., for colon cancer patients \u226575 years). Greater variability in the estimates was observed when the cure assumption was not supported by the data (breast cancer).If the data suggest cure is not a reasonable assumption then we advise against fitting cure models. In the scenarios where cure was reasonable, we found that flexible parametric cure models performed at least as well, or better, than the other modelling approaches. We recommend that, regardless of the model used, the underlying assumptions for cure and model fit should always be graphically assessed.",

     "abstract": "A typical summary statistic for temporal trends is the average percent change (APC). The APC is estimated by using a generalized linear model, usually under the assumption of linearity on the logarithmic scale. A serious limitation of least-squares type estimators is their sensitivity to outliers. The goal of this study is twofold: firstly, we propose a robust and easy-to-compute measure of the temporal trend based on the median of the rates (median percent change \u2013 MPC), rather than their mean, under the hypothesis of constant relative change; secondly, we investigate the performance of several models for estimating the rate of change when some of the most common model assumptions are violated. We provide some guidance on the practices of the estimation of temporal trends when using different models under different circumstances. The robustness property of the median is assessed in a simulation study, which shows that the MPC provides strong reductions in estimation bias and variance in presence of outliers. We also demonstrate how a mathematical property of the median helps addressing the issue of zero counts when estimating trends on the log-scale. Finally, we analyzed an English cancer registration dataset to illustrate the proposed method. We believe that, as a good practice, both APC and MPC should be presented when sensitivity issues arise.",

The 15-year prevalence at 1st January 2003 for 255 cancers is obtained from a pool of 22 RARECARE cancer registries (CRs). Incidence and survival models are applied to the RARECARE database to estimate the parameters from which the completeness indices are calculated. Complete prevalence is obtained adjusting the observed 15-year prevalence by the completeness index, to account for those cancer survivors diagnosed before the CR activity started. Main factors influencing the performance of the completeness index method for rare cancers are the same as for common cancers: age distribution of incidence and lethality of the cancer. For cancers occurring in the elderly, with low survival rates and consequently a restricted number of long-term survivors we obtained completeness indices higher than 0.9. Values lower than 0.7 correspond to those cancers with good prognosis and/or incidence more concentrated at the younger ages, indicating that 15 years of follow up are insufficient to detect all prevalent cases. Validation analysis shows that for a restricted subgroup of rare cancers with very low incidence and low survival, the completeness indices were not able to adequately correct the observed prevalence even considering a registration period of 20 years. On average, sensitivity analyses show a slight overestimation of complete prevalence for rare and common cancers whose increasing incidence is known in literature. RARECARE is the largest project on rare cancers conducted to date. Improving health care programs for cancer survivors is a public health priority and prevalence data which provides important information in this field should be regularly asked to Member States and included in the EU health statistics.",

Based on a flexible excess hazard model providing unbiased estimates of net survival, our methodology avoids the pitfalls associated with the use of the cause of death. We used data from FRANCIM, the French network of cancer registries, and studied five common cancer sites: head and neck, breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers.For breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, the impact of the other causes on the total probability of death increased with the age at diagnosis whereas it remained negligible for lung and head and neck cancers whatever the age. For breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, the more recently was the cancer diagnosed, the less was the probability of death from cancer.The crude probability of death is an intuitive concept that may prove particularly useful in choosing an appropriate treatment, or refining the indication of a screening strategy by allowing the clinician to estimate the proportion of cancer patients who will die specifically from cancer.",

A new model is developed with only two explanatory variables and a simple graphical output.This is a retrospective cohort study based on data collected from December 2006 to June 2011 at the Clinic of Urology of the University Hospital in Olomouc, Czech Republic. The cohort consists of 221 patients who underwent the first repeated biopsy after an initial biopsy with a negative outcome. All patients had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels between 1.5 and 16.5\u00a0ng/mL and a prostate volume not greater than 100\u00a0mL. A logistic regression model was fitted.Of the 221 patients, 29 (13%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer on the repeated biopsy. The final model includes the PSA level and the transitory zone volume as predictors. Its accuracy is 76.4%. The cut-off point of 0.0687 in the predicted positive repeated biopsy outcome assures 95% sensitivity and prevents 42% of unnecessary biopsies.The accuracy of the model is comparable to that of more complex models (with more than two predictors) published in the literature. The model includes only two routinely measured variables, and hence it is accessible for a wide range of practitioners. The simple graphical outcome makes the model even more attractive.",

Digoxin, which can also cause gynecomastia, has been associated with increased incidence of breast and uterus cancers. We therefore postulated that spironolactone use might also increase these cancer risks. Using a nationwide prescription drug registry between 1995 and 2010, we identified use of spironolactone in a cohort of Danish women (\u226520 years old). In users and non-users, incidence rate ratios adjusted by age group and calendar-year examined risk of breast and uterus cancers, both estrogen-sensitive, and ovary and cervix cancers, both relatively estrogen-insensitive. As an added control exposure, risk ratios in women who used another diuretic, furosemide, were examined by the same approach. Among 2.3 million women (28.5 million person-years), risks of breast, uterus, ovary, and cervix cancers were generally increased about 10\u201330% in both spironolactone and furosemide users. In the first year of drug exposure, incidences were increased, especially for ovary cancers. However, incidence increases in the first year of use were not specific for estrogen-sensitive cancers, occurred with both spironolactone and furosemide, and were driven by exposures immediately prior to diagnosis. For drug exposure \u22651 years before cancer diagnosis, incidences of these cancers were not significantly increased. We conclude that associations observed with first use in the year immediately before cancer diagnosis were driven by reverse causality, i.e., because of treatment for symptoms related to the incipient cancer. With respect to breast, uterus, ovarian and cervical cancer, there is no evidence of increased risk with spironolactone or furosemide use.",

Methods: Using population-based registries we conducted a case\u2013control study nested in the Danish female population. We identified all women aged 55\u201384 years with a first diagnosis of histologically verified brain glioma during 2000\u20132009. Using risk-set sampling, each case was matched on birth year to eight population controls.

     "abstract": "Background: The association between antihypertensive medications and survival in cancer patients remains unclear. Objectives: To explore the association between classes of antihypertensive drugs and survival in cancer patients. Methods: Provincial Cancer Registry data was linked with a Provincial Drug Program Information Network (DPIN) for patients with lung (n\u00a0=\u00a04241), colorectal (n\u00a0=\u00a03967), breast (n\u00a0=\u00a04019) or prostate (n\u00a0=\u00a03355) cancer between the years of 2004 and 2008. Cox regression analyses were used to compare survival of patients using beta blockers (BBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/receptor blockers (ACEi/ARB), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) or thiazide diuretics (TDs) to survival of patients who did not use any of these antihypertensive drugs. Survival of patients using only one class of antihypertensive drugs were compared to each other, with BBs as the reference class. Results: Compared to the antihypertensive drug non-user cohort, BBs had no effect on survival for any of the cancers. ACEi/ARBs use was weakly associated with increased deaths for breast cancer (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.04\u20131.44) and lung cancer (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.03\u20131.21) patients. Deaths were also increased with CCB use in patients with breast cancer (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.02\u20131.47) and with TD use in lung cancer patients (HR: 1.1, 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.19). There was strong evidence (p-value <0.0001) of an increase in deaths with TD use for colorectal (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.15\u20131.42), and prostate (HR 1.41, 1.2\u20131.65) cancer patients. When including only antihypertensive drug users prescribed one drug class, lung cancer patients receiving CCBs had improved survival compared to BBs (HR 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64\u20130.98). Conclusions: Some classes of antihypertensive agents are associated with a decreased survival in certain cancers. The decrease could be due to more comorbidities in antihypertensive drug users. However, CCB use was associated with improved survival in lung cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "Background: Ecological studies showing an inverse association between pancreatic cancer incidence and mortality and levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR), suggest that higher levels of sun exposure may reduce risks of pancreatic cancer but there has been only one individual-level study that examined this issue. We aimed to examine the association between pancreatic cancer and markers of exposure to solar UVR, namely skin type, treatment of skin lesions, ambient UVR and time outdoors on work days. Methods: We used data from an Australian case-control study. Location at birth, residential location during adulthood, outdoors work, history of skin lesion treatment and sensitivity of the skin to the sun were obtained by questionnaire. We limited the analyses to Caucasians who answered the questionnaire about UVR (controls\u00a0=\u00a0589/711 recruited; cases\u00a0=\u00a0496/705 recruited). We used NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer to estimate ambient UVR. Results: Being born in or living in areas of higher ambient UVR (compared to lower ambient UVR) was associated with about 30\u201340% lower risk of pancreatic cancer. People with fair skin colour had 47% lower risk of pancreatic cancer than those with dark skin colour (95% CI 0.37\u20130.75). There was some suggestion of increased risk with increased average number of hours spent outside at work. Conclusions: This study suggests that people with light skin colour or those born or living in areas of high ambient UVR have lower risk of pancreatic cancer. Our analysis supports an association between UVR and pancreatic cancer, possibly mediated through production of vitamin D.",

Methods: A case\u2013control study was conducted during 2008\u20132009 in the Urumqi and Shihezi, Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. Participants were 359 incident oesophageal cancer patients and 380 hospital-based controls. Information on habitual foods consumption was obtained by face-to-face interview, from which dietary fibre intakes were estimated using the Chinese food composition tables. Results: The oesophageal cancer patients reported lower intake levels of total dietary fibre and fibre derived from vegetables and fruits than those of controls. Overall, regular intake of fibre was inversely associated with the oesophageal cancer risk, the adjusted odds ratio being 0.47 (95% confidence interval 0.32\u20130.69) for the highest (>27\u00a0g) versus the lowest (<16\u00a0g) tertile of daily intake, with a significant dose-response relationship (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Similar reductions in risk were also apparent for high intake levels of vegetable fibre and fruit fibre, but to a lesser extent for cereal fibre.

Only one study, a cohort study examining risk of all cancers, investigated their role in cervical cancer with inconsistent findings between non-aspirin NSAIDs and aspirin. The aim of this study was to further investigate NSAID/aspirin use and cervical cancer risk. Methods: Using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink, 724 women diagnosed with cervical cancer between 1 January, 1995 and December 2010 were compared to 3479 women (without cervical cancer) matched on year of birth and general practice. Conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for smoking, sexually transmitted infections, HRT and contraceptive use, was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for cervical cancer risk among users of any oral NSAIDs, non-aspirin NSAIDs and aspirin, as assessed from primary care prescribing data. Results: Excluding the year prior to diagnosis, there was no association in adjusted analyses between ever vs. never use of an NSAID (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77\u20131.09), non-aspirin NSAID (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.80\u20131.13) or low-dose aspirin (OR 1.07, 0.80\u20131.44) and cervical cancer risk. In analysis of daily defined doses, there was no association with cervical cancer risk comparing the highest users to non-users of NSAIDs (OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.69\u20131.39) or non-aspirin NSAIDs (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.70\u20131.43) or low-dose aspirin (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.59\u20131.81).

     "abstract": "Objective: An inverse association between personal history of allergies/asthma and glioma risk has been fairly consistently reported in the epidemiologic literature. However, the role of regular antihistamine use remains controversial due to a small number of studies reporting contradictory findings. We evaluated the association between regular use of oral antihistamines and glioma risk, adjusting for a number of relevant factors (e.g., immunoglobulin E levels and history of chickenpox). Methods: We used a subset of the Harris County Case-Control Study, which included 362 pathologically confirmed glioma cases and 462 cancer-free controls, to evaluate this association using unconditional multivariable logistic regression. These models were run among the overall study population and stratified by allergy status. Cox regression was utilized to examine whether antihistamine use was associated with mortality among all cases and separately among high-grade cases. Results: Antihistamine use was strongly associated with glioma risk among those with a positive allergy/asthma history (OR: 4.19, 95% CI: 2.06\u20138.51), but not among those with a negative history (OR: 1.59, 95% CI: 0.95\u20132.67). There were no significant associations between antihistamine use and survival among cases. Conclusion: The current study implies that regular antihistamine use may increase glioma risk.

Methods: We systematically examined the 70.772\u00a0kb region comprising four genes on chromosome 19q13.3 among Chinese using the haplotype-tagging SNP (htSNP) approach and the HapMap platform. The study involved 339 lung cancer cases and 358 non-cancer controls. Two htSNPs (rs1046282 and rs735482) captured most of the common haplotypes of CD3EA and the combined effects of sixteen htSNPs provided high coverage of common haplotypes of ERCC2, PPP1R13L, CD3EAP and ERCC1. Results: Both carriers of variant CC genotype [adjusted OR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.28 (1.02\u20131.60), P\u00a0=\u00a00.04] and variant C-allele among >20 years\u2019 smokers [OR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.13 (1.24\u20133.67), P\u00a0=\u00a00.006] for CD3EAP rs735482 were at increased risk of lung cancer. Four haplotype blocks of strong linkage disequilibrium were identified. The haplotype ERCC2 rs3916874G and rs238415C [OR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.26 (1.02\u20131.57), P\u00a0=\u00a00.03] in block 1 and the haplotype PPP1R13L rs4803817A, CD3EAP rs1046282T, rs735482C, ERCC1 rs3212980A, rs3212964G [OR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a03.56 (1.55\u20138.18), P\u00a0=\u00a00.005] in block 3 were associated with lung cancer risk.

Conclusions: HapMap-based study of 19q13.3 identified that genetic variation of CD3EAP and two loci were associated with lung cancer risk and interaction of smoking duration and genetic variants was the strongest predictor of lung cancer risk in a Chinese population.",

Therefore, we evaluated the association between relative telomere length (RTL) and glioma in a prospective study.We performed a nested case-control study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.

Conditional logistic regression was used to investigate the association between RTL and glioma.As expected, RTL declined with increasing age in both cases and controls.

     "abstract": "Background: Participation in screening tests for colorectal cancer (CRC) is generally low in Ontario, Canada. In addition, inequities in participation exist including lower participation among low-income individuals, males and individuals living in rural areas. In April 2008, Colon Cancer Check (CCC) program, the province-wide CRC screening program, was launched in Ontario. This study describes the trends and inequities in CRC screening participation three years before and three years after the CCC, and assesses the effect of the program on CRC screening participation, overall and among certain population groups. Methods: We used administrative data to identify cohorts of individuals eligible for CRC screening in fiscal years 2005\u20132011. We calculated the age-standardized percent of Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT) participation, large bowel endoscopy participation, and being \u2018up-to-date\u2019 with CRC screening tests. Results: From 2005 to 2011, FOBT participation increased from 7.6% to 14.8%, large bowel endoscopy participation from 3.4% to 5.7%, and \u2018up-to-date\u2019 with CRC screening from 27.2% to 41.3%. Before the launch of the CCC program, the quarterly increase in FOBT participation was 0.07% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.19), increased immediately after the launch (1.8%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), followed by a decline (\u22120.08%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.08), returning to its pre-program increase rate. We noted a significant decrease in FOBT participation every summer (\u22120.44%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The CCC program had minimal effect on large bowel endoscopy participation. Before the launch of the CCC program, the quarterly increase in \u2018up-to-date\u2019 with CRC screening was 0.9% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), increased immediately after the launch (2.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), followed by a modest decline thereafter (\u22120.59%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.02). From 2005 to 2011, recent residents living in low-income neighborhoods were consistently and significantly less likely to have a FOBT and be \u2018up-to-date\u2019 with CRC screening than long-term residents living in high-income neighborhoods (2.9\u20134.5%; 14.7\u201317.3% respectively). Pre-CCC inequities in CRC participation persisted after the launch of the program. Conclusion: CRC testing was increasing in Ontario from 2005. An immediate increase in CRC testing, FOBT in particular, occurred after the launch of the CCC program, followed by a return to its pre-CCC increase rate thereafter. Future efforts are needed to improve screening participation and address inequities.",

It targets men and women aged 50\u201374 who are invited every 2 years to perform a guaiac faecal occult blood test, followed, if positive, by a colonoscopy. This paper presents the evaluation of the programme for the 46 French districts that conducted a comprehensive screening campaign during 2008\u20132009, targeting 9.7 million people. Methods: National database gathering information on people who were screened was used to estimate indicators reflecting the programme performance. Results: Participation was 34.3%, with nearly three million people being tested. The percentage of positive tests was 2.8%. Completion of colonoscopies following a positive test was 88%. For men, 36.8% of the results of colonic explorations were normal, 40.1% were adenomas, and 9.0% were CRC, based on the most pejorative lesion. For women, corresponding figures were 55.9%, 25.7% and 5.8%. A CRC was detected for 7.5% of people who had a colonic exploration. The advanced adenoma detection rate among those screened was 4.9\u2030 and the CRC detection rate was 1.9\u2030. The description of CRC could only be made for 21 districts, for which 1441 invasive colonic adenocarcinomas were diagnosed; of these, 43% were stage I, 23% stage II, 25% stage III and 9% stage IV. Conclusion: This first evaluation since the programme was rolled out provides an inventory of CRC screening in France and points out some improvements expected, especially in terms of participation which is below the European recommendations. Future evaluations will analyse trends in these indicators.",

     "abstract": "In the Netherlands, breast cancer patients are treated and followed at least 5 years after diagnosis. Furthermore, all women aged 50\u201374 are invited biennially for mammography by the nationwide screening programme. The relation between the outpatient follow-up (follow-up visits in the outpatient clinic for 5 years after treatment) and the screening programme is not well established and attending the screening programme as well as outpatient follow-up is considered undesirable. This study evaluates potential factors influencing women to attend the screening programme during their outpatient follow-up (overlap) and the (re-)attendance to the screening programme after 5 years of outpatient follow-up.Data of breast cancer patients aged 50\u201374 years, treated for primary breast cancer between 1996 and 2007 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and linked to the National Breast Cancer Screening Programme in the Northern region. Cox regression analyses were used to study women (re-)attending the screening programme over time, possible overlap with the outpatient follow-up and factors influencing this.In total 11\u00a0227 breast cancer patients were included, of whom 19% attended the screening programme after breast cancer treatment, 4.4% within 5 years and 15.4% after more than 5 years. Factors that independently influenced attendance within 5 years as well as more than 5 years after treatment were: interval tumours (HR 0.77; 95%CI 0.61\u20130.97 and HR 0.69; 95%CI 0.53\u20130.88, ref: screen-detected tumours), receiving adjuvant radiotherapy (HR 0.65; 95%CI 0.47\u20130.90 and HR 0.66; 95%CI 0.47\u20130.93; ref: none) and diagnosis of in situ tumours (HR 1.67; 95%CI 1.25\u20132.23 and HR 1.39; 95%CI 1.05\u20131.85; ref: stage I tumours).

Understanding cancer patients\u2019 navigation pathways for seeking treatment is important in order to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. With this background we conducted a hospital-based cross-sectional study comprising 68 randomly selected cancer inpatients in a tertiary cancer specialty hospital in Odisha, India, to explore the treatment-seeking pathways of the cancer patients and the barriers and enablers in seeking treatment. Financial constraint is one of the major reasons for the delay in accessing treatment, even when patients are suspected of or diagnosed with cancer. Low awareness of the presenting signs and symptoms of cancer and limited knowledge of the availability of cancer diagnosis and treatment facilities are major factors contributing to delay. Family and friends\u2019 support is found to be the major enabling factor toward seeking treatment. Generation of awareness of cancer among the general population and primary-care practitioners \u2013 including those in alternative systems of medicine \u2013 is important.

Unfortunately, past research has shown that SSE has low sensitivity in detecting atypical nevi. The current study investigates whether crowdsourcing (collective effort) can improve SSE identification accuracy. Collective effort is potentially useful for improving people's visual identification of atypical nevi during SSE because, even when a single person has low reliability at a task, the pattern of the group can overcome the limitations of each individual.Adults (N\u00a0=\u00a0500) were recruited from a shopping mall in the Midwest. Participants viewed educational pamphlets about SSE and then completed a mole identification task. For the task, participants were asked to circle mole images that appeared atypical. Forty nevi images were provided; nine of the images were of nevi that were later diagnosed as melanoma.Consistent with past research, individual effort exhibited modest sensitivity (.58) for identifying atypical nevi in the mole identification task. As predicted, collective effort overcame the limitations of individual effort. Specifically, a 19% collective effort identification threshold exhibited superior sensitivity (.90).The results of the current study suggest that limitations of SSE can be countered by collective effort, a finding that supports the pursuit of interventions promoting early melanoma detection that contain crowdsourced visual identification components.",

Methods The retrospective study enrolled 87 patients diagnosed with CSCC between 2004 and 2006. TMPRSS4 expression in CSCC was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and data on clinical variables were collected by retrospective chart review. The impact of TMPRSS4 expression on 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and 5-year overall survival (OS) was assessed by Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results The high expression of TMPRSS4 was 63.2% in 87 patients with CSCC, and 17.5% in 40 patients with benign cervical disease (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). High TMPRSS4 expression was significantly associated with tumor grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and deep cervical stromal invasion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025).

In the previous study, we have detected the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of let-7 and susceptibility to HCC. However, it is still unknown whether these polymorphisms are associated with HCC prognosis. Methods: We investigated the effect of two potentially functional SNPs in the promoter region of let-7 family, rs10877887 (T\u00a0>\u00a0C) and rs13293512 (T\u00a0>\u00a0C), on the overall survival of 331 HCC patients. Log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used for the survival analyses. Results: We found that HCC patients carrying the C allele of rs10877887 had a significantly increased death risk (adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a01.22, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02\u20131.47, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03 in the additive model), compared to those with T allele.

Numerous vectors have been engineered for the sole purpose of killing cancer cells, and some have successfully suppressed malignant tumours. Many plant proteins have anticancer properties; consequently, genes encoding some of these proteins are being used to design constructs for the inhibition of multiplying cancer cells. Results: Data addressing the function of vectors harbouring genes specifically encoding ricin, saporin, lunasin, linamarase, and tomato thymidine kinase 1 under the control of different promoters are summarised here. Constructs employing genes to encode cytotoxic proteins as well as constructs employing genes of enzymes that convert a nontoxic prodrug into a toxic drug are considered here.

The risk of development of cancer in systemic sclerosis (SSc) has been extensively investigated with inconclusive results. To shed some light on the controversy, we conducted a meta-analysis of all published articles linking SSc to the risk of cancer development. Methods: Relevant electronic databases were searched for English-language studies characterizing the association of cancers in patients with SSc. Standardized incidence rate (SIR) with its 95% confidence interval (CI) of each study was combined using a fixed/random effect model. Results: A total of seven papers including 7183 SSc patients were identified, of which 7 reported the SIR for lung cancer, 4 for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 4 for hematopoietic cancer and 7 for breast cancer. Compared with the general population, the combined SIR was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.02\u20134.89), 2.68 (95% CI: 1.58\u20134.56), 2.57 (95% CI: 1.79\u20133.68) and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.86\u20131.38), respectively.

Thirty-seven European population-based cancer registries from Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland participated in this study. World age-standardized incidence rates were first analyzed graphically and then using a Poisson regression model, in order to estimate average annual percent changes (AAPCs). The overall incidence rate of BC in the area covered increased linearly during the study period by 1.19% (0.93; 1.46) on average per year. This increase varied between countries from 0.20% (\u22120.53; 0.64) in Bulgaria to 2.68% (1.97; 3.40) in Portugal.

The rise in incidence was greater for women under 35 and for ductal carcinomas. This increase can be due to a rise in risk factors and/or changes in diagnosis and surveillance practices, but we could not clearly distinguish between these two non-exclusive explanations.",

Methods: DNA was extracted from microdissected tumor and adjacent normal tissue of 90 paraffin blocks of CRC cases (1997\u20132007) collected at the University of Ghana. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was determined using fragment analysis of ten microsatellite markers. We analyzed expression of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins by immunohistochemistry and sequenced exons 2 and 3 of KRAS and exon 15 of BRAF. Results: MSI analysis showed 41% (29/70) MSI-High, 20% (14/70) MSI-Low, and 39% (27/70) microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors. Sequencing of KRAS exons 2 and 3 identified activating mutations in 32% (24/75) of tumors, and sequencing of BRAF exon 15, the location of the common activating mutation (V600), did not show mutations at codons 599 and 600 in 88 tumors. Conclusions: Our study found a high frequency of MSI-High colorectal tumors (41%) in Ghana. While the frequency of KRAS mutations is comparable with other populations, absence of BRAF mutations is intriguing and would require further analysis of the molecular epidemiology of CRC in West Africa.",

     "abstract": "Background: Prostate cancer (PC) survivors may have an increased risk of new primary cancers (NPCs) due to shared risk factors or PC-directed treatments. Methods: Using Danish registries, we conducted a cohort study of men with (n\u00a0=\u00a030,220) and without PC (n\u00a0=\u00a0151,100) (comparators), matched 1:5 on age and PC diagnosis/index date. We computed incidence rates of NPCs per 10,000 person years (PY) and associated 95% confidence intervals (CI), and used Cox proportional hazards regression to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%CI, adjusting for comorbidities. In order to obviate any impact of shorter survival among prostate cancer patients, we censored comparator patients when the matched prostate cancer patient died or was censored. Results: Follow-up spanned 113,487\u00a0PY and 462,982\u00a0PY in the PC and comparison cohorts, respectively. 65% of the cohorts were aged >70 years at diagnosis. Among PC patients, 51% had distant/unspecified stage, and 63% had surgery as primary treatment. The PC cohort had lower incidence of NPCs than their comparators. The adjusted HR of NPC among men with PC versus the comparators was 0.84 (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.80, 0.88). Lowest HRs were among older men, those with distant stage, and were particularly evident for cancers of the brain, liver, pancreas, respiratory, upper gastrointestinal, and urinary systems. Conclusions: We find no evidence of an increased risk of NPCs among men with PC. The deficit of NPCs among men with PC may be a true effect but is more likely due to lower levels of risk factors (e.g., smoking) in PC patients versus comparators, clinical consideration of cancers at new organs as metastases rather than new primaries, or under-recording/under-reporting of NPCs among PC patients.",

Rates using multiple causes were about 80% higher than those based on underlying cause alone. From 2001 to 2004 the rate for MDS using underlying cause alone (but not using multiple causes) declined, accompanied by an increase in the rate for deaths from leukemia as underlying cause with mention of MDS; this trend coincided with the advent of the 2001 World Health Organization's reclassification of certain MDS as leukemia. The MDS rate for age 65+ years increased after 2005, whereas the rate for age 25\u201364 years was low but declined from 2001 to 2003 and then stabilized. For deaths with MDS coded as other than underlying cause, rates did not decline for deaths from each of the two most common causes (i.e., cardiovascular diseases and leukemia).Evidence for decreases in MDS-related mortality rates was limited; the increase at age 65+ years is consistent with increases in incidence rates reported from cancer registries. Using multiple causes of death vs. only the underlying cause results in substantially higher MDS-related death rates, shows the impact of changes in the classification of myeloid neoplasms and emphasizes the importance of reducing cardiovascular disease mortality in MDS patients.",

Subgroup analyses were carried out by age, gender and stage at diagnosis. Seasonal trend was assessed by a harmonic function in a Poisson regression model, adjusted for the number of live births.No trend in the date of diagnosis was found either in the entire cohort or in the various sub-groups. Similarly, a seasonal trend of birth was not observed in the whole cohort. Conversely, in the subgroup of infants with stage 4S, a significant peak of July births was found (23.6% increment from the average, p\u00a0=\u00a00.042). The summer peak was confirmed after stratifying 4S patients by gender and period of diagnosis.A major effect of risk factors related to seasonality does not appear to affect the risk of developing neuroblastoma. However, the time pattern of birth observed by stage at diagnosis is consistent with the hypothesis that Stage 4S is a distinct disease with probably a different aetiology, as indicated by investigations on its metastatic pattern and its peculiar gene expression. An aetiological role of seasonally related factors, e.g., favouring the survival of defective neural crest stem cells, remains speculative and need confirmation by independent studies.",

     "abstract": "Objective: Alcohol and tobacco are the two major established environmental factors associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (ESCC). However, the prevalence of these exposures differs substantially between men and women. Moreover, the prevalence of smoking has declined in recent years, whereas per capita consumption of alcohol has remained steady in both sexes. Quantifying the burden of ESCC attributable to these causal factors is necessary to inform potential preventive strategies. Methods: We estimated the population attributable fraction (PAF) of ESCC due to smoking and alcohol, using data from an Australian population based case\u2013control study (305 ESCC cases, 1554 controls). Results: Estimated PAF for ESCC were 49% (95% CI: 38\u201360) and 32% (95% CI: 25\u201340) due to smoking and heavy alcohol consumption respectively. More than 75% of the ESCC burden in men could be attributed to smokers with heavy alcohol consumption. The highest burden was among \u226530 pack years smokers who also consumed alcohol heavily (>17 drinks/week); this differed significantly between men (PAF 36%, 95% CI 29\u201344) and women (PAF 5%, 95% CI 2\u201310). Among women only, low intakes of fruit and vegetables accounted for about 9% of the ESCC burden. Conclusion: The burden of ESCC attributable to smoking combined with heavy alcohol consumption is remarkably high in men. In women, the burden of ESCC due to these factors is lower, and poor nutrition may also play a role.",

     "abstract": "Objective: Area\u2013age\u2013period\u2013cohort (AAPC) model has been widely used in studying the spatial and temporal pattern of disease incidence and mortality rates. However, lack of biological plausibility and ease of interpretability on temporal components especially for age effects are generally the weakness of AAPC models. We develop a Bayesian AAPC model where carcinogenesis age effect is incorporated to explain age effects from the underlying disease process. An autoregressive prior structure and an arbitrary linear constraint are used to solve the nonidentifiability issues. Methods: Two multistage carcinogenesis models are employed to derive the hazard functions to substitute the age effects in the AAPC models. The Iowa county-wide lung cancer mortality data are used for the model fitting and Deviance Information Criteria (DIC) is used for model comparison. Results: Our study shows that conventional AAPC model (DIC\u00a0=\u00a019,231.30), AAPC model with Armitage\u2013Doll age effect (DIC\u00a0=\u00a019,233.00) and with two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) age effect (DIC\u00a0=\u00a019,234.70) achieved the similar DIC values which indicated consistent model fitting among three models. The spatial pattern shows that the high spatial effects are clustered in the south of Iowa and also in largely populated areas. The lung cancer mortality rate is continuously declining by birth cohorts while increasing by the calendar period until 2000\u20132004. The age effects show an increasing pattern over time which can be easily explained by Armitage\u2013Doll carcinogenesis model since we assume a log-linear relationship between age and hazard function. Conclusions: Our finding suggests that the proposed Bayesian AAPC model can be used to replace the conventional AAPC model without affecting model performance while providing a more biological sound approach from the underlining disease process.",

Increased breast cancer risk has also been observed among shift workers, suggesting potential interactions in relationships of circadian genes with breast cancer. Relationships with breast cancer of 100 SNPs in 14 clock-related genes, as well as potential interactions with shift work history, were investigated in a case\u2013control study (1042 cases, 1051 controls). Odds ratios in an additive genetic model for European-ancestry participants (645 cases, 806 controls) were calculated, using a two-step correction for multiple testing: within each gene through permutation testing (10,000 permutations), and correcting for the false discovery rate across genes. Interactions of genotypes with ethnicity and shift work (<2 years vs \u22652 years) were evaluated individually. Following permutation analysis, two SNPs (rs3816360 in ARNTL and rs11113179 in CRY1) displayed significant associations with breast cancer and one SNP (rs3027188 in PER1) was marginally significant; however, none were significant following adjustment for the false discovery rate. No significant interaction with shift work history was detected. If shift work causes circadian disruption, this was not reflected in associations between clock gene variants and breast cancer risk in this study. Larger studies are needed to assess interactions with longer durations (>30 years) of shift work that have been associated with breast cancer.",

However, the results remain controversial. Our previous study showed that HPV serostatus is not an independent risk factor for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in nonsmokers and nondrinkers. Given the roles of p53 and HPV E6 as well as MDM2 oncoproteins in p53 degradation, we validated the association of p53 and MDM2 polymorphisms with ESCC risk stratified by HPV16 sero-status.Single nucleotide polymorphisms of p53 Arg72Pro (rs1042522) and MDM2 (rs937283) in 307 ESCC patients and 311 healthy controls were genotyped. The presence or absence of HPV16 in serum was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the possible associations of p53 and MDM2 polymorphisms with ESCC risk stratified by HPV16 sero-status.Patients carrying p53 Arg/Arg or Arg/Pro had a higher risk of esophageal SCC (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Odds ratio [OR] 4.98, 95% confidential interval [CI] 3.46\u20137.17), however, not found in MDM2 rs937283.

     "abstract": "Centrosome aberrations and cell-cycle deregulation have important implications for ovarian cancer development. The AURKA, BRCA1, CCNE1 and CDK2 genes play pivotal roles in centrosome duplication and cell-cycle regulation.Using a haplotype-based analysis, this study aimed to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms in these four genes may contribute to ovarian cancer susceptibility. A total of 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these four genes were genotyped in 287 cases of ovarian serous cystadenocarcinomas and 618 age-matched cancer-free controls from the Chinese Han population, and then haplotype blocks were reconstructed according to our genotyping data and linkage disequilibrium (LD) status of these SNPs.For AURKA, we found that haplotype GA [rs6064391 (T\u2192G)\u00a0+\u00a0rs911162 (G\u2192A)] was strongly associated with decreased ovarian cancer risk (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.31, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.15\u20130.63, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0012). For BRCA1, we found that haplotype CGTAG was associated with decreased ovarian cancer risk (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.64, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.41\u20130.98, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0417).

In CCNE1, the SNPs rs3218035 and rs3218042 were significantly associated with increased ovarian cancer risk (rs3218035: adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a05.20, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.85\u201314.52, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0017; rs3218042: adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a04.98, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.75\u201314.19, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0027). For CDK2, no significant association was found.This study indicates that genetic polymorphisms of AURKA, BRCA1 and CCNE1 may affect ovarian cancer susceptibility in Chinese Han women.",

In the present study, we validated this finding and also explored the risk of ESCC associated with other two unreported potentially functional SNPs (rs17417407 G\u00a0>\u00a0T and rs2274224 C\u00a0>\u00a0G) of PLCE1 in a population-based case\u2013control study to investigate the association between these three potentially functional SNPs in PLCE1 and susceptibility to ESCC. A total of 381 ESCC cases and 420 controls matched by age and sex were recruited and successfully genotyped for three SNPs (rs17417407, rs2274223 and rs2274224) of the PLCE1 in a central Chinese population. SNP rs2274223 was independently associated with increased risk of ESCC (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2.80; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.45\u20135.39 for GG vs. AA), and SNP rs2274224 was found to be associated with decreased risk of ESCC (adjusted OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46\u20130.91 for CG vs. CC). The combined effects of risk alleles for three SNPs (rs17417407T, rs2274223G and rs2274224G) were found to be associated with elevated risk of ESCC in a dose-dependent effect manner (Ptrend\u00a0=\u00a00.005).

The pattern of CYP2A13 distribution in respiratory tract affects the susceptibility of the lung to carcinogens. CYP2A13 is expressed in the epithelium of trachea and bronchi; however its pattern of expression in human lung cancer remains largely unknown. This study aimed to determine the CYP2A13 expression in specimens from human non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), i.e., adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma, by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis and to identify the potential linkage between tumor CYP2A13 levels and some clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC patients in Taiwan. The tumor CYP2A13 IHC staining signal was strong in 76% of the 112 study subjects. Study subjects (especially non-smoking or lung adenocarcinoma patients) with higher tumor CYP2A13 levels were younger. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that in younger subjects (age\u00a0\u2264\u00a066) and heavy smokers (pack-years\u00a0\u2265\u00a040), the odds ratio (OR) for positive tumor CYP2A13 staining was significantly higher than that for negative tumor CYP2A13 staining. Moreover, the association of EGFR gene mutations and positive tumor CYP2A13 staining was also revealed. In conclusion, these findings suggest the potential involvement of pulmonary CYP2A13 in the early occurrence of NSCLC as well as in the development of EGFR gene mutations.",

We aimed to compare women's personal characteristics, tumoral features and the radiological appearance of cancers with and without a previous false-positive result generated by additional imaging or invasive procedures.From 1996 to 2007, 111,098 women aged 45\u201369 years participated in four population-based breast cancer screening programs in Spain, and 1281 cancers were detected. We included all cancers detected in subsequent screenings (n\u00a0=\u00a0703) and explored the occurrence of previous false-positive results. We identified false-positives requiring additional imaging or invasive procedures. Differences on tumoral features (invasiveness, tumor size, and lymph node status) and radiological appearance were assessed by Chi-square test, and agreement between the location of cancer and prior suspicious by Cohen's kappa coefficient. A multivariate analysis was preformed to evaluate the effect of previous screening results and age on the odds of presenting an in situ carcinoma.Among the 703 cancers detected in subsequent screenings, 148 women (21.1%) had a previous false-positive result. Of these, 105 were by additional imaging and 43 by invasive procedures. Women with prior false-positive result requiring invasive assessment, compared to women with negative tests, and women with prior false-positive requiring additional imaging, had a higher proportion of in situ carcinomas (31.7%, 15.3%, 12.9%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) and microcalcifications (37.2%, 20.2%, 9.5%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).

GSTP1 gene overexpression has been observed in a variety of human cancers but there are no studies in plasma cell disorders. The aim of this study was to examine GSTP1 mRNA expression level in multiple myeloma (MM) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). In addition, we have determined GSTP1 polymorphic variants in order to estimate MM risk and their relationship with the expression level. Results were also correlated with laboratory parameters and clinical outcome.Bone marrow mononuclear cells from 125 patients with plasma cell disorders were studied. Peripheral blood samples of 110 age and sex matched healthy controls were also evaluated. Real-Time Quantitative RT-PCR and PCR-RFLP assays were used.Upregulation of GSTP1 was observed in 37.7% MM and in 22.6% MGUS patients. A significant increase of GSTP1 expression in MM with respect to MGUS was detected (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0427). Most MM patients that achieved complete remission had low transcription levels (77.8%) compared to those who did not reach this condition (44.4%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0347). GSTP1 heterozygous carriers showed reduced expression compared to those with homozygous wild type genotype (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0135).Our findings suggest, for the first time, a role for GSTP1 expression in development and/or progression of plasma cell disorders, and a probable influence of functional capacity of the enzyme on clinical outcome.

However, a large number of alternative treatments (monotherapies and combinations) have been studied in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to identify more effective treatments. Aim of the present study was to assess the relative effectiveness and tolerability of these treatments. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were systematically searched to identify all RCTs that compared treatments for SCLC. Then, effectiveness of the treatments relative to the combination of Cisplatin plus Etoposide, reference treatment) was estimated by performing a network of treatments analysis. The analysis evaluated two efficacy outcomes (complete response \u2013 CR and objective response rate \u2013 ORR) and two tolerability outcomes (neutropenia and febrile neutropenia). All RCTs that provided data for calculating the odds ratios (OR) for the selected outcomes were considered. The network analysis involved direct and indirect analyses. Results: We identified 71 articles eligible for inclusion, involving 91 different treatments. In total, 16,026 patients were included in the analysis. In the direct analysis the combination of Cisplatin plus Cyclophosphamide plus Etoposide plus Epirubicin showed better response than EP for the ORR outcome, but with worse tolerability (presence of neutropenia). The indirect analysis revealed that the combination of Cisplatin plus Doxorubicin plus Etoposide (plus Vincrisitine) showed better response that EP for the ORR outcome. Conclusions: No therapy shows better response for the two efficacy outcomes (CR and ORR); though, Cisplatin plus Doxorubicin plus Etoposide plus Vincrisitine might be a promising therapy for SCLC. The results should be interpreted with caution because the network was dominated by indirect comparisons. Large scale head-to-head RCTs are needed to confirm the present findings.",

This study was designed to compare characteristics of cancers detected by either organized or opportunistic screening as well as clinically diagnosed cancers in Loire-Atlantique (a French administrative entity), from 2003 to 2007. Methods: This study is based on data from the population-based Loire-Atlantique Cancer Registry. Stage at diagnosis and prognostic characteristics of carcinomas detected by organized screening were compared, by age-adjusted logistic regressions, to those of cancers detected by opportunistic screening and diagnosed clinically. Analyses were restricted to women aged 50\u201374 years (the age group targeted by the organized screening program) for the 2003\u20132007 period. Results: Between 2003 and 2007, 2864 invasive and 400 in situ breast cancer cases were diagnosed in women aged 50\u201374 years in Loire-Atlantique. Compared to cancers diagnosed clinically, cancers detected by organized screening were more likely to be in situ (13.7% vs. 3.8%), diagnosed at an early stage (74.4% vs. 51.3%), have a low SBR grade (grade 1: 35.4% vs. 18.5%), and be positive for estrogen\u2013progesterone receptors (68.3% vs. 59.0%). The distribution of stage at diagnosis and prognostic characteristics between organized and opportunistic screening were similar. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that breast cancers are detected early by organized screening. Cancer characteristics were similar between the two screening modes. Estimating the impact of mammography screening on mortality in Loire-Atlantique should be the object of further investigations.",

     "abstract": "Context: The evaluation of national cancer plans is an important aspect of their implementation. For this evaluation, the principal actors in the field (doctors, nurses, etc.) as well as decision-makers must have access to information that is reliable, synthetic and easy to interpret, and which reflects the implementation process in the field. We propose here a methodology to make this type of information available in the context of reducing inequalities with regard to access to healthcare for patients with lung cancer in the region of Burgundy. Methods: We used the national medico-administrative DRG-type database, which gathers together all hospital stays. By using this database, it was possible to identify and reconstruct the care management history of these patients. That is, by linking together all attended hospitals, sorted chronologically. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old, whatever the gender and had undergone surgery for their lung cancer. They had to be residents of Burgundy at the time of the first operation between 2006 and 2008. Patient's pathway was defined as the sequence of all attended hospitals (hospital stays) during the year of follow up linked together using an anonymised patient identifier. We then constructed a pathway typology of pathway using an unsupervised clustering method, and conducted a spatial analysis of this typology. Results: Between 2006 and 2008, we selected 495 patients in the 4 administrative departments of the Burgundy region. They accounted for a total of 3821 stays during the year of follow-up. There were 393 men (79%) and the mean age was 64 (95% confidence interval: 63\u201365) years. We reconstructed 94 pathways (about five per patient). Here, neighbourhood's cares accounted for 41% of them, while 44% included a surgical intervention outside the region of Burgundy. We constructed a pathway typology with five classes. Spatial analysis showed that the vast majority of initial surgeries took place in the major regional centres. Conclusion: The construction of a pathway typology leads to better understanding of the reasoning that lies behind the movements of patients. It opens the way for analysis of the collaboration between the different healthcares establishments attended, which should bring to light associations that need to be developed.",

     "abstract": "Background and aim: Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), a member of the MMP family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases, has been detected to be strongly expressed in gliomas with high tumor grade and to be correlated with increased tumor invasiveness. Vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C), which is able to induce MMP-1 transcription, has been found to be upregulated in glioblastoma compared to low grade gliomas and non-neoplastic brain. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical significance of the co-expression of MMP-1 and VEGF-C in glioma patients on determining the prognosis. Methods: One hundred and sixteen glioma patients (26 World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, 30 WHO grade II, 30 WHO grade III, and 30 WHO grade IV) and 15 non-neoplastic brain specimens acquired from 15 patients undergoing surgery for epilepsy as control were collected. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the expression of MMP-1 and VEGF-C in glioma and non-neoplastic brain tissues. The correlations of collaborative MMP-1 and VEGF-C expression with selected clinicopathologic parameters and clinical outcome of glioma patients were also assessed. Results: Both MMP-1 and VEGF-C expression were significantly higher in glioma tissues compared to non-neoplastic brain tissues (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Of 116 glioma patients, 68 (58.62%) overexpressed MMP-1 and VEGF-C simultaneously. In addition, combined MMP-1 and VEGF-C expression was significantly associated with WHO grade (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Moreover, glioma patients expressing both MMP-1 and VEGF-C exhibited markedly poorer overall survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). According to the multivariate analyses, collaborative overexpression of MMP-1 and VEGF-C was found to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Conclusions: Our data demonstrated for the first time that overexpression of both MMP-1 and VEGF-C may be an independent poor prognostic factor in gliomas, suggesting the interaction between MMP-1 and VEGF-C collaboratively stimulated advanced tumor progression and adverse outcome. Inhibiting both MMP-1 and VEGF-C could be a novel therapeutic approach for gliomas.",

Methods: cf-DNA was extracted from serum collected from 40 NPC patients and 41 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. The promoter hypermethylation status of the five genes (RASSF1, CDKN2A, DLEC1, DAPK1 and UCHL1) was assessed by methylation-specific PCR after sodium bisulfite conversion.

We examined the overall survival of HIV-infected patients who developed cancer. Design: A retrospective cohort study. Methods: Using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database, we compared patients diagnosed with HIV (n\u00a0=\u00a09918) between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2007 with age-matched controls (n\u00a0=\u00a099,180). Each patient was followed until the end of 2009 (least 2 years after the initial HIV diagnosis) to evaluate the incidence of malignancies. Results: The risk of overall malignancies in the HIV-infected cohort was 1.88 times higher than the risk of a first malignancy in the age-matched non-HIV infected cohort (incidence rate ratio [IRR])\u00a0=\u00a02.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The diagnosis of a malignancy was negatively correlated with survival in the HIV-infected cohort (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0011), and HIV infection had a synergistic effect on the survival of patients with malignancies compared with the non-HIV infected cohort, all of who had been newly diagnosed with cancer (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). However, the difference in the risk of developing nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly prevalent malignancy in Taiwan, between the two cohorts was not significant (IRR\u00a0=\u00a00.22, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.03\u20131.65). Conclusions: The risk of cancer in HIV-infected patients in Taiwan has increased significantly in the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy. A history of HIV significantly affected the survival of the patients in our study cohort after they developed cancer.Evidence level: 2B.",

     "abstract": "Background: C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) has been implicated in the invasiveness and metastasis of diverse cancers. However, the published data remain controversial on the correlation between CXCR4 expression level, as well as its subcellular distribution in tumor cells, and the clinical outcome of patients with breast cancer. Methods: To identify the precise role of CXCR4 in the clinical outcome of breast cancer, we performed a meta-analysis including 15 published studies. Original data included the hazard ratios (HRs) of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in breast cancer with high CXCR4 expression versus low expression. We pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate the hazard. Results: A total of 15 published studies (including 3104 patients) were eligible. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of breast cancer were found to be significantly related to CXCR4 expression level, with the HR being 1.65 (95%CI: 1.34\u20132.03; P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001) and 1.94 (95%CI: 1.42\u20132.65; P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001) respectively. Stratified analysis according to subcellular distribution of CXCR4 showed that high expression in whole cells, cytoplasm and nucleus could predict unfavorable OS, with the HR of 2.02 (95%CI: 1.43\u20132.85; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), 1.57 (95%CI: 1.13\u20132.18; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007), and 1.47 (95%CI: 1.19\u20131.81; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) respectively. As for DFS, elevated expression level of CXCR4 both in whole cells and cytoplasm predicted a poor outcome, with the HR being 2.23 (95%CI: 1.48\u20133.37; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and 1.76 (95%CI: 1.11\u20132.80; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), while high expression in the nucleus had no statistical significance, with HR 1.15 (95%CI: 0.52\u20132.55; P\u00a0=\u00a00.73). Conclusions: Increased CXCR4 expression, especially in whole cells and cytoplasm, may serve as a poor prognostic indicator in patients with breast cancer. Future studies are warranted to investigate the relationship between CXCR4 expression and survival of patients with breast carcinoma, which could help predict the clinical outcome and guide clinical decision-making for therapy.",

However, the role of SOX6 in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been explored. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of SOX6 in HCC and determine its correlation with tumor progression and prognosis.130 HCC patients who had undergone curative liver resection were selected and immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) were performed to analyze SOX6 expression in the respective tumors.Q-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting consistently confirmed the decreased expression of SOX6 at both mRNA and protein levels in HCC tissues compared with their adjacent nonneoplastic tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Additionally, the expression of SOX6, determined by immunohistochemistry, was negatively correlated with the tumor stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and serum AFP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Moreover, HCC patients with lower SOX6 expression had worse 5-year disease-free survival and 5-year overall survival than those with high SOX6 expression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006 and 0.001, respectively). Furthermore, the Cox proportional hazards model showed that the decreased expression of SOX6 was an independent poor prognostic factor for both 5-year disease-free survival (hazards ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a02.398, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.601\u20135.993, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and 5-year overall survival (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.569, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.381\u20137.290, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) in HCC.These findings provide evidence for the first time that SOX6 expression was decreased in HCC, which correlated with poor prognosis, suggesting that SOX6 may be a novel and potential prognostic marker for HCC.",

We examined the relationships among metformin use, diabetes, and survival in postmenopausal women with CRC in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trials and observational study. Methods: 2066 postmenopausal women with CRC were followed for a median of 4.1 years, with 589 deaths after CRC diagnosis from all causes and 414 deaths directly attributed to CRC. CRC-specific survival was compared among women with diabetes with metformin use (n\u00a0=\u00a084); women with diabetes with no metformin use (n\u00a0=\u00a0128); and women without diabetes (n\u00a0=\u00a01854). Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate associations among metformin use, diabetes and survival after CRC. Strategies to adjust for potential confounders included: multivariate adjustment with known predictors of colorectal cancer survival and construction of a propensity score for the likelihood of receiving metformin, with model stratification by propensity score quintile. Results: After adjusting for age and stage, CRC specific survival in women with diabetes with metformin use was not significantly different compared to that in women with diabetes with no metformin use (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.40\u20131.38, p\u00a0=\u00a00.67) and to women without diabetes (HR 1.00; 95% CI 0.61\u20131.66, p\u00a0=\u00a00.99).

Present study aimed to explore the clinical significance of serum TGF-\u03b21 levels in patients with lung cancer and analyze the relationship between TGF-\u03b21 and existing tumor markers for lung cancer. Methods: Serum was collected from 118 patients with lung cancer and 40 healthy volunteers. Serum TGF-\u03b21 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and the association with various clinical characteristics was analyzed. The diagnostic value of TGF-\u03b21 was assessed alone and in combination with existing tumor markers for lung cancer. Results: Serum TGF-\u03b21 levels were significantly higher in patients with lung cancer compared to healthy volunteers [0.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 (0.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105, 0.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105)\u00a0pg/ml vs 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 (0.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105, 0.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105)\u00a0pg/ml, P\u00a0=\u00a00.040]. Although there was a positive correlation between serum TGF-\u03b21 levels and advanced stages, the significant difference was not found between early stages and advanced stages (P\u00a0=\u00a00.116). The ability of serum TGF-\u03b21 to discriminate lung cancer at a cutoff value of 79,168\u00a0pg/ml exhibited sensitivity of 30.6% and specificity of 97.5%. Serum TGF-\u03b21 levels were correlated to cytokeratin fragment 21-1 (CYFRA21-1; R\u00a0=\u00a00.308, P\u00a0=\u00a00.020) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE; R\u00a0=\u00a00.558, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003).

There remains debate however, about whether accurate risk prediction is achievable for most cancers. Methods: We conducted a brief narrative review of the literature regarding the history and challenges of risk prediction, highlighting our own recent experiences in developing tools for oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Results and conclusions: While tools for predicting future risk of cardiovascular outcomes have been translated successfully to clinical practice, the experience with cancer risk prediction has been mixed. Models have now been developed and validated for predicting risk of melanoma and cancers of the breast, colo-rectum, lung, liver, oesophagus and prostate, and while several of these have adequate performance at the population-level, none to date have adequate discrimination for predicting risk in individual patients. Challenges of individual risk prediction for cancer are many, and include long latency, multiple risk factors of mostly small effect, and incomplete knowledge of the causal pathways.",

Methods: Besides using the GBD approach to calculate the Years of Life Lost in Korea during 2000\u20132020, this research calculates the Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) of major cancers based on the combination of the GBD method and the IPM Model. Results: Colon, breast and thyroid cancers became more significant in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years during 2000\u20132010 and this will continue during 2010\u20132020, colon cancer leading the pack instead of stomach cancer in 2020. The rise of colon cancer is more evident for the older age group and the opposite is true for breast and thyroid cancers. Indeed, stomach and liver cancers were resilient in terms of DALYs during 2000\u20132010 and this will continue during 2010\u20132020. Overall, the burden of cancer in Korea is characterized by an increasing centrality of YLDs (chronic components) as in other advanced nations. Conclusions: Korea's convergence with other advanced nations in cancer burden might reflect their convergence in living standards, the age structure, health behavior and medical technology during the past four decades. These transitions have been reflected in the Second 10-Year Plan for Cancer Control in Korea during 2006\u20132015, government policy consisting of four main programs, i.e., primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis/treatment and palliative care.",

In Spain, a marked spatial aggregation of areas with excess mortality due to this cause has long been reported. This paper sought to analyse the evolution of gastric cancer mortality risk in Spanish provinces and explore the possible attenuation of the geographical pattern. Methods: We studied a series of gastric cancer mortality data by province, year of death, sex and age group using a conditional autoregressive (CAR) model that incorporated space, time and spatio-temporal interactions. Results: Gastric cancer mortality risk decreased in all Spanish provinces in both males and females. Overall, decreasing trends were more pronounced during the first years of the study period, largely due to a sharper fall in gastric cancer mortality risk among the older population. Recent decades have witnessed a slowing in the rate of decrease, especially among the younger age groups. In most areas, risk declined at a similar rate, thus serving to maintain interprovincial differences and the persistence of the geographical pattern, though with some differences. The north and northwest provinces were the areas with higher mortality risks in both sexes and age groups over the entire study period. Concluding statement: Despite the decline in gastric cancer mortality risk observed for the 50 Spanish provinces studied, geographical differences still persist in Spain, and the cluster of excess mortality in the north-west of the country remains in evidence.",

Associations between HMW exposures and lymphoma were evaluated using pooled unconditional logistic regression analyses.Individuals exposed to HMW agents had a non-statistically significant decreased risk of any lymphoma (OR, 0.88: 95% CI, 0.74\u20131.05) and of B-cell lymphoma (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.76\u20131.09), and a significantly decreased risk for Hodgkin lymphoma (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40\u20130.98). A decrease in risk for lymphoma was found for exposure to latex (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.55\u20130.99).Further epidemiologic and mechanistic research is needed to confirm that occupational exposure to HMW agents predisposing to asthma can reduce the risk of lymphoma.",

Methods: We matched California Cancer Registry records of hepatoblastomas diagnosed in children younger than age 6 from 1988 to 2007 to birth records using a probabilistic record linkage program, yielding 261 cases. Controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0218,277), frequency matched by birth year to all cancer cases in California for the same time period, were randomly selected from California birth records. We examined demographic and socioeconomic information, birth characteristics, pregnancy history, complications in pregnancy, labor and delivery, and abnormal conditions and clinical procedures relating to the newborn, with study data taken from birth certificates. Results: We observed increased risks for hepatoblastoma among children with low [1500\u20132499\u00a0g, Odds Ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a02.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29\u20133.15] and very low birthweight (<1500\u00a0g, OR\u00a0=\u00a015.4, 95% CI 10.7\u201322.3), preterm birth <33 weeks (OR\u00a0=\u00a07.27, 95% CI 5.00, 10.6), small size for gestational age (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.75, 95% CI 1.25\u20132.45), and with multiple birth pregnancies (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.52, 95% CI 1.54\u20134.14). We observed a number of pregnancy and labor complications to be related to hepatoblastoma, including preeclampsia, premature labor, fetal distress, and congenital anomalies. Conclusion: These findings confirm previously reported associations with low birthweight and preeclampsia. The relation with multiple birth pregnancies has been previously reported and may indicate a relation to infertility treatments.",

Nonetheless, the incidence of pediatric CNS tumors in developing countries is poorly understood. We aimed to provide epidemiologic features of primary malignant CNS tumors in Iranian children 0\u201319 years of age using National Cancer Registry (NCR) data bank.The data recorded by NCR over a 10 year period (2000\u20132010) were reviewed.Of 1948 tumor cases, 93.3% were located in brain, 5.1% were found in the spinal cord & cauda equina, and 1.6% affected cranial nerves and other parts of the nervous system. The overall average annual age specific incidence rate was 1.43 per 100,000. Males were more likely to develop CNS tumors (1.65 per 100,000) compared to females (1.21 per 100,000, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Children under 5 years of age had the highest age specific incidence rate (1.86 per 100,000). Astrocytic tumors with the incidence rate of 0.61 per 100,000 were the most frequent specific histology followed by embryonal (0.38 per 100,000), and ependymal tumors (0.10 per 100,000). With regard to the histological distribution of tumors, some unique features including the high proportion of unspecified malignant neoplasms (7.6%) were noted.The overall incidence rate was markedly lower than western findings. Major differences were also observed in incidence rates of specific histologies. Although the discrepancies may be attributable to diversity in classification schemes and registration practices, a real ethnic and geographical variation in predisposition to development of pediatric CNS cancers is strongly suggested.",

Other (non-sexually transmitted) infections during pregnancy were associated with decreased risk of total CNS tumors (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.28, 95% CI: 0.09\u20130.85). Maternal blood/immune disorders during pregnancy were linked to increased risk of CNS tumors (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.28, 95% CI: 1.08\u20134.83) and medulloblastoma (OR\u00a0=\u00a07.13, 95% CI: 0.82\u201361.03).

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated with logistic regression controlling for adult smoking in the total study population, and in never-smokers only (184 cases and 415 controls).

Methods: To evaluate a potential association of this mutation with CRC, we genotyped the mutation in 2695 CRC cases and 4593 controls from population-based registries in Canada and Australia. Results: The HOXB13 pGly84Glu mutation was more common in CRC cases than controls (0.48% vs. 0.17%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) indicating a significant association between the HOXB13 variant and CRC risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.8; 95%CI: 1.2\u20136.8).

Previous studies indicated that diabetes may increase the risk of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Metabolic syndrome has not been investigated as a risk factor. We tested whether type II diabetes or metabolic syndrome were associated with HNSCC using a very large database of medical administrative records, providing the ability to investigate relatively weak effects and stratify by subgroups.We identified persons diagnosed with HNSCC between 1994 and 2007 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database.

We estimated odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between type II diabetes/metabolic syndrome and HNSCC, adjusted for potential confounders, among 14,022 cases and 42,066 controls.We observed a very weak inverse association between type II diabetes and HNSCC (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.92; 95% CI, 0.88\u20130.96) and a moderate inverse association for metabolic syndrome (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.81; 95% CI, 0.78\u20130.85).

We examined the association between telomere length and skin cancer in a clinic-based case-control study of 198 melanoma cases, 136 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cases, 185 basal cell carcinoma (BCC) cases, and 372 healthy controls. Methods: Cases were histologically confirmed patients treated at the Moffitt Cancer Center and University of South Florida Dermatology Clinic in Tampa, FL. Controls self-reported no history of cancer and underwent a skin cancer screening exam at study enrollment to rule out the presence of skin cancer. Quantitative real time PCR was used to measure telomere length in peripheral blood samples. Results: Melanoma patients had longer telomeres than controls (odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a03.75; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.02\u20136.94 for highest versus lowest tertile) (P for trend\u00a0=\u00a0<0.0001).

Methods: An excess hazard regression model with a piecewise constant baseline hazard was used and a normal distribution was assumed for the random effect. Likelihood maximization was performed using a numerical integration technique, the Quadrature of Gauss\u2013Hermite. Results were obtained with colon-rectum and thyroid cancer data from the French network of cancer registries. Result: The results were in agreement with what was theoretically expected. We showed a greater heterogeneity of the excess hazard in thyroid cancers than in colon-rectum cancers. The hazard ratios for the covariates as estimated with the mixed-effect model were close to those obtained with the fixed-effect model. However, unlike the fixed-effect model, the mixed-effect model allowed the analysis of data with a large number of clusters. The shrinkage estimator associated with D\u00e9partement is an optimal measure of D\u00e9partement-specific excess risk of death and the variance of the random effect gave information on the within-cluster correlation.

Materials and methods: We used a sample collected by the French cancer registries of 1840 cases (T1: 583; T2: 1257) diagnosed in 2001. The proportion of over-diagnosed and over-treated patients was estimated by comparing life expectancy (LE), including or not comorbidities, with natural LE with cancer, using several assumptions from the literature. We distinguished potential and actual over-treatment according to the treatment that patients actually received. Results: Among patients with T1 tumors the proportion of potential over-treatment using LE adjusted for comorbidity varied from 29.5% to 53.5%, using LE adjusted on comorbidities, and varied from 9.3% to 22.2% regarding actual over-treatment. Between 7.7% and 24.4% of patient's receiving a radical prostatectomy, and between 30.8% and 62.5% of those receiving radiotherapy, were over-treated. Among patients with T2 tumors, the proportions of potential and actual over-treatment were 0.9% and 2.0%. Two per cent of patients receiving a radical prostatectomy and 4.9% of those receiving radiotherapy were over-treated. Comorbidities dramatically increased these proportions to nearly 100% of patients, with more than two comorbidities being potentially over-treated and around 33% actually over-treated. Conclusions: According to the French incidence, 3200\u20134800 French patients may be over-treated, among whom a large proportion of patients had comorbidities. The real issue is to offer the most appropriate treatment to people with low-grade tumors and comorbidities.",

Methods: Data from district screening centres were used to evaluate the process of identification and selection of eligible FDRs (residence in the Emilia-Romagna Region, age 40\u201375 years, no recent colonoscopy) of screen-detected CRC patients and the detected prevalence of disease. The probability for an FDR to undergo colonoscopy and to be diagnosed with CRC and advanced adenoma was estimated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The sex- and age-standardised ratio of detected prevalence to that expected based on results from a colonoscopy screening study of the Italian general population was estimated. Results: Between 2005 and 2011, 9319 FDRs of 2437 screen-detected CRC patients (3.8 per patient) were identified and contacted. Their likelihood of being eligible for, and accepting, colonoscopy was 0.11 (95% confidence interval: 0.11\u20130.12). Among the 926 subjects undergoing colonoscopy, the prevalence of previous negative screening FOBT was 63%. Eleven CRCs (1.2%) and 100 advanced adenomas (10.8%) were detected. The standardised ratio of detected prevalence to that expected was 0.91 (95% confidence interval: 0.19\u20132.66) for CRC and 1.48 (1.04\u20132.05) for advanced adenoma. Conclusions: The procedure of selection of FDRs was extremely ineffective. Due to previous negative screening tests, the prevalence of disease was less than expected. A population-based FOBT screening programme is a highly unsuitable setting for the provision of surveillance to FDRs of CRC patients.",

They were shown to have a different distribution within the various ethnic populations. Few studies have applied the same classification to Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS). We report the distribution of the molecular breast cancer subtypes in DCIS between African American (AA) and Caucasian American (CA) women, their association with pathological features and outcome. Materials and methods: Tissue microarrays were constructed from paraffin blocks of 94 DCIS cases (67 AA and 27 CA) selected from a cohort of AA and CA patients diagnosed with DCIS between 1996 and 2000; mean age at diagnosis was 61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 for the AA and 58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 years for the CA group. TMA blocks were labeled with antibodies for ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67, and CK5/6. The cases were subtyped as Luminal A (ER+ and/or PR+; HER2\u2212), Luminal B (ER+ and/or PR+; HER2+), HER2+ (ER\u2212, PR\u2212; HER2+), basal-like (BL) (ER\u2212, PR\u2212, HER2\u2212; CK5/6+) or unclassified triple negative (UTN) (ER\u2212, PR\u2212, HER2\u2212, CK5/6\u2212). Information on grade, size and follow-up were obtained. Results: (1) Most DCIS cases were Luminal A, comprising 80% of the DCIS cases in AA and 92.6% in CA patients. (2) HER2+, BL and UTN DCIS subtypes were not seen in the CA population, and formed 9% of the DCIS cases in the AA population; these cases were all high grade. (3) In the cases with recurrence (8 AA and 1 CA patients), DCIS was Luminal A in 6 AA and 1 CA and Luminal B in 2 AA patients. Conclusion: The distribution of the molecular subtypes of DCIS did not show a significant difference between the two ethnic groups in our study. In addition, the risk of recurrence might not be higher in the non-luminal subtypes than in Luminal A and B.",

Alcohol metabolism to cytotoxic and mutagenic intermediates acetaldehyde and reactive oxygen species is critical for alcohol-drinking-associated carcinogenesis. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in alcohol metabolism-related and antioxidant genes influence SCCHN survival.Interview and genotyping data (64 polymorphisms in 12 genes) were obtained from 1227 white and African-American cases from the Carolina Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology study, a population-based case\u2013control study of SCCHN conducted in North Carolina from 2002 to 2006. Vital status, date and cause of death through 2009 were obtained from the National Death Index. Kaplan\u2013Meier log-rank tests and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated to identify alleles associated with survival.Most tested SNPs were not associated with survival, with the exception of the minor alleles of rs3813865 and rs8192772 in CYP2E1. These were associated with poorer cancer-specific survival (HRrs3813865, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a02.00, 1.33\u20133.01; HRrs8192772, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.62, 1.17\u20132.23). Hazard ratios for 8 additional SNPs in CYP2E1, GPx2, SOD1, and SOD2, though not statistically significant, were suggestive of differences in allele hazards for all-cause and/or cancer death. No consistent associations with survival were found for SNPs in ADH1B, ADH1C, ADH4, ADH7, ALDH2, GPx2, GPx4, and CAT.We identified some polymorphisms in alcohol and oxidative stress metabolism genes that influence survival in subjects with SCCHN.

Methods: We pooled data from 11 cancer registries of Germany and used data from the U.S. (SEER-13 database) including 11,508 and 10,774 newly diagnosed cases (1997\u20132006) in Germany and the U.S., respectively. We estimated 5-year relative survival (5-year-RS) by histology and age based on period analysis. Results: 5-year-RS for testicular germ cell tumors was 96.7% and 96.3% in Germany and the U.S., respectively. 5-Year-RS for spermatocytic seminoma was close to 100% in both countries. 5-Year-RS for nonseminoma was lower than for classical seminoma in Germany (93.3% versus 97.6%) and the U.S. (91.0% versus 98.2%). Among nonseminomas, choriocarcinomas provided the lowest 5-year-RS in both countries (Germany 80.1%, U.S. 79.6%). Age-specific 5-year-RS for seminoma showed only little variation by age. 5-Year-RS for nonseminomas tended to be lower at higher ages, especially for malignant teratoma. Discussion: This is the first study that provides up-to-date survival estimates for testicular cancer by histology and age in Germany and the U.S. Survival after a diagnosis of testicular cancer is very comparable between Germany and the U.S. 5-Year-RS for spermatocytic seminoma was close to 100% and the lowest 5-year-RS occurred among choriocarcinoma. Higher age at diagnosis is associated with a poorer prognosis among nonseminoma patients.",

Few studies have examined the factors which impact (1) staging or (2) outcomes for patients who are registered as having unknown stage. This study investigated (1) the prevalence of unknown stage at diagnosis on the New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR); (2) explored factors which predict unknown stage; (3) described receipt of surgery and (4) survival outcomes for patients with unknown stage. Methods: Patients diagnosed with the most prevalent 18 cancers between 2006 and 2008 (N\u00a0=\u00a041,489) were identified from the NZCR, with additional data obtained from mortality and hospitalisation databases. Logistic and Cox regression were used to investigate predictors of unknown stage and patient outcomes. Results: (1) Three distinct groups of cancers were found based on proportion of patients with unknown stage (low\u00a0=\u00a0up to 33% unknown stage; moderate\u00a0=\u00a033\u201364%; high\u00a0=\u00a065%+). (2) Increasing age was a significant predictor of unknown stage (adjusted odds ratios [ORs]: 1.18\u20131.24 per 5-year increase across groups). Patients with substantive comorbidity were more likely to have unknown stage but only for those cancers with a low (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.65 [2.28\u20133.09]) or moderate (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.17 [1.03\u20131.33]) proportion of patients with unknown stage. (3) Patients with unknown stage were significantly less likely to have received definitive surgery than those with local or regional disease across investigated cancers. (4) Patients with unknown stage had 28-day and 1-year survival which was intermediate between regional and distant disease. Discussion: We found that stage completeness differs widely by cancer site. In many cases, the proportion of unknown stage on a population-based register can be explained by patient, service and/or cancer related factors.",

Methods: OOSCC cases (N\u00a0=\u00a0159) with a history of either tobacco or alcohol use were genotyped for polymorphisms in eight DMEs. Overall and disease-specific survival were analyzed using Kaplan\u2013Meier plots and the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) in exploratory analyses of patient subgroups. Results: Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses showed N-acteyltransferase-2 (NAT2) fast acetylators experienced a 19.7% higher 5-year survival rate than slow acetylators (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and this association was similar in oropharyngeal and oral cancer. After multiple adjustment, including tumor site and stage, the NAT2 fast acetylator phenotype was associated with improved overall survival (vs. slow acetylators) provided chemotherapy or radiation were not used (HR, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.10\u20130.66). However, NAT2 phenotype was unrelated to survival in patients treated with chemoradiotherapy (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.54\u20132.73) or radiotherapy (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.31\u20131.59) (P-for-NAT2/treatment-interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Normal activity GSTP1 was associated with a 19.2% reduction in 5-year disease-specific survival relative to reduced activity GSTP1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) but this association was not modified by treatment.

Therefore significant efforts are being made to develop novel strategies for the treatment of ovarian cancer. Salinomycin has been shown to be highly effective in the elimination of cancer stem cells both in vitro and in vivo. The present study focused on investigating important cell signaling molecules such as Akt and NF-\u03baB during salinomycin-induced apoptosis in cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer cells (A2780cis).MTT assay was performed to determine cell viability. Flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assay were performed to analyze the effect on cell cycle and apoptosis. The expression of apoptosis related proteins was evaluated by Western blot analysis.The cell viability was significantly reduced by salinomycin treatment in a dose dependent manner. The flow cytometry result showed an increase in sub-G1 phase. Salinomycin inhibited the nuclear transportation of NF-\u03baB, and downregulated Akt expression. Declined Bcl-2, activation of caspase-3 and increased PARP cleavage triggered apoptosis. Moreover, DNA fragmentation assay also revealed apoptotic induction.The result suggested that salinomycin-induced apoptosis in A2780cis was associated with inhibition of Akt/NF-\u03baB. It may become a potential chemotherapeutic agent for the cisplatin resistant ovarian cancer therapy.",

Sixty-one (61.2%) percent were male. Mean age at diagnosis was 38.5 years (9.4% <20 years and only 4.7% \u226565 years). Using GEE, Asians were youngest (38.3 years), followed by Africans (39.5 years), Southern/Eastern Europeans (41.1 years) and Latin Americans (41.3 years; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Diagnoses were predominately in chronic stage (78.3%). In 2002, 85.2% of patients had a delay in treatment >1 year; decreasing to 15.5% in 2010 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The 3-year overall survival probability was 89.4% (95% CI, 88.9\u201389.9). In multivariate analysis, risk of death increased among patients 65 years or older at diagnosis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), time from diagnosis to treatment >1-year (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), diagnoses in the accelerated or blast crisis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), initial dose of Imatinib >400\u00a0mg (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and among Latin Americans and Africans (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).The GIPAP cohort is the largest series of patients with CML described from low and middle income countries. Differences in age at diagnosis and overall survival exist within and between regions. Additional epidemiological studies should be conducted to assess for possible environmental factors associated with the earlier age at onset.",

     "abstract": "Background: Several studies have evidenced an increase in the incidence of childhood leukaemia since the 1970s but the variations since 2000 have received little attention. Seasonal variations in incidence have also been widely investigated, with however inconsistent conclusions. The present study aimed to investigate jointly the temporal trends and the seasonal variations in the month of diagnosis of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Methods: All the cases of ALL registered in the French National Registry of Childhood Haematological malignancies during 1990\u20132007 were included in the study. The overall temporal trend and seasonality of ALL were tested with Poisson regression models on 0\u201314-year-old ALL cases, and specifically on the B-cell precursor ALL (Bcp-ALL) cases. The analyses were also stratified by age groups and gender. Results: Over 1990\u20132007, a significant time trend in risk of +0.48% (0.02\u20130.95%) per year for all ALL and +0.85% (0.33\u20131.37%) for Bcp-ALL was found. The increase was more marked for 7\u201314-year-old girls with a trend of +2.84% (1.34\u20134.36%) per year for Bcp-ALL. Seasonal variations were also evidenced for 1\u20136-year-old boys, with a standardised incidence ratio of 1.11 (1.04\u20131.18) for Bcp-ALL in April, August and December. Conclusion: The study showed an increase in childhood ALL risk over 1990\u20132007, which tended to be stronger for 7\u201314-year-old Bcp-ALL, particularly in girls (about one case per year, on average). However, although in accordance with the log-linear assumption, the increase in risk seemed less marked after 2001. The study also suggested seasonal variations in the month of diagnosis for 1\u20136-year-old boys.",

Data for diagnostic procedures for Latina Province residents from 2001 to 2006 were extracted from the regional outpatient procedures information system.A total of 982 cases were diagnosed, for a standardized incidence of 8.3 and of 27.9 per 100,000 in males (n, 220) and in females (n, 762), respectively.

The increase was mostly due to papillary (n, 759) and small (\u226420\u00a0mm) cancers (n, 617), with no difference by age (<45 years; n, 431). The APC of neck ultrasound performed was +8.7% (95% CI +0.1, +18.1) and +9.0% (95% CI +1.1, +17.4) and that of biopsy/cytology was +17.0% (95% CI +13.0, +21.3) and +16.6% (95% CI +6.2, +28.1) in men and women, respectively. The geographic pattern of biopsy/cytology was similar to that of cancer incidence but not to that of neck ultrasound.In Latina, the increase in thyroid cancer incidence was more rapid than in the rest of Italy, particularly for types with a good prognosis.

     "abstract": "In countries with local cancer registration, the national cancer incidence is usually estimated by multiplying the national mortality by the incidence/mortality (I/M) ratio from pooled registries. This study aims at validating this I/M estimation in France, by a comparison with estimation obtained using the ratio of incidence over hospital discharge (I/HD) or the ratio of incidence over health insurance data (long-duration diseases, I/LDD).This comparison was performed for 22 cancer sites over the period 2004\u20132006. In France, a longitudinal I/M approach was developed relying on incidence and mortality trend analyses; here, the corresponding estimations of national incidence were extracted for 2004\u20132006. The I/HD and I/LDD estimations were performed using a common cross-sectional methodology.The three estimations were found similar for most cancers. The relative differences in incidence rates (vs. I/M) were below 5% for numerous cancers and below 10% for all cancers but three. The highest differences were observed for thyroid cancer (up to +21% in women and +8% in men), skin melanoma (up to +13% in women and +8% in men), and Hodgkin disease in men (up to +15%). Differences were also observed in women aged over 60 for cervical cancer. Except for thyroid cancer, differences were mainly due to the smoothing performed in the I/M approach.Our results support the validity of I/M approaches for national estimations, except for thyroid cancer. The longitudinal version of this approach has, furthermore, the advantage of providing smoothed estimations and trend analyses, including useful birth-cohort indicators, and should thus be preferred.",

If individuals with risk factors are more likely to harbor cancer or it precursors screening programs should be targeted toward this population. We evaluated the predictive value of colorectal cancer risk factors for the detection of advanced colorectal adenoma in a population based CRC colonoscopy screening program. Data were collected in a multicenter trial conducted in the Netherlands, in which 6600 asymptomatic men and women between 50 and 75 years were randomly selected from a population registry. They were invited to undergo a screening colonoscopy. Based on a review of the literature CRC risk factors were selected. Information on risk factors was obtained from screening attendees through a questionnaire. For each CRC risk factor, we estimated its odds ratio (OR) relative to the presence of advanced neoplasia as detected at colonoscopy. Of the 1426 screening participants who underwent a colonoscopy, 1236 (86%) completed the risk questionnaire. 110 participants (8.9%) had advanced neoplasia. The following risk factors were significantly associated with advanced neoplasia detected by colonoscopy: age (OR: 1.06 per year; 95% CI: 1.03\u20131.10), calcium intake (OR: 0.99 per mg; 95% CI: 0.99\u20131.00), positive CRC family history (OR: 1.55 per first degree family member; 95%CI: 1.11\u20132.16) and smoking (OR: 1.75; 95%CI: 1.09\u20132.82).

We used data from 689 cases of oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma and 3481 controls. Odds-ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) associated with tea and coffee consumption (quantity, duration, cumulative consumption) were estimated by unconditional logistic regression with adjustment for age, gender, area of residence, education, body mass index, tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking.We observed inverse associations between oral cavity cancer and tea or coffee consumption (odds ratio, 0.39; 95% CI 0.21\u20130.70, for the highest quartile of tea consumption, and 0.60, 95% CI 0.34\u20131.05, for the highest quartile of coffee consumption). Exclusive tea or coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of oral cavity cancer and their joint effect was multiplicative. No differences in risk between men and women or between consumers of tobacco and alcohol and non-consumers were observed. The odds ratios related to the subsites usually included in the oropharynx (soft palate and base of the tongue) did not differ significantly from that observed for the other subsites of the oral cavity.Tea and coffee drinking may decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer through antioxidant components which play a role in the repair of cellular damages.

This study was conducted to assess aflatoxin (AF) contamination of wheat flour (WF) samples in high and low EC-risk areas of Golestan province. Methods: Four WF samples were collected randomly from each of 25 active silos throughout the province in 2009. The levels of AFs were measured using the High-performance liquid chromatography method. Using the data of EC rates obtained from Golestan population-based cancer registry, the province was divided into high and low risk areas for EC. Student t-test and multivariate regression analysis were used to compare the levels of aflatoxins as well as the condition of silos between the two areas. Results: One hundred WF samples were collected. The mean levels of total aflatoxin and aflatoxin B1 was 1.99 and 0.53\u00a0ng\u00a0g\u22121, respectively. The levels of total AF (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), AFG2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and AFB1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) were significantly higher in samples obtained from high risk area. Multivariate regression analysis showed that humidity of silo was the most important source of difference between silos of the two areas (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Conclusion: We found a positive relationship between AF level of WF samples and the risk of EC. So, AF contamination may be a possible risk factor for EC in our region. We also found that humidity of silos was the most important determinant of AF contamination of WF. Intensive control of silos conditions including humidity and temperature are needed especially in high EC-risk areas.",

The aim of this study was to review the epidemiological characteristics of bone GCT in the extremity based on the clinical data from four hospitals in South China. Methods: We searched medical electronic records from January 2001 to December 2011 in four hospitals in South China to identify patients with definite diagnosis of extremity GCT. Epidemiological data including gender, tumor site, age at the time of first diagnosis, local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis were collected and analyzed statistically. Differences between-genders were particularly analyzed regarding first diagnosis age, tumor site, local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis. T-test and Chi-square test were used for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Results: A total of 140 GCT patients (87 males and 53 females) were identified. The gender ratio was 1.64 for a male predominance. GCTs were mostly located around the knee (67 cases). 92 patients were in their 20s to 40s upon first diagnosis. The average age at the time of first diagnosis for all was 30.49 years, 30.76 years for males and 30.06 years for females (P\u00a0=\u00a00.757). GCT recurred locally in 50 patients (26 males and 24 females) with no gender difference (P\u00a0=\u00a00.065). The average interval from first surgery to local recurrence was 21.42 months. Pulmonary metastasis was found in 11 patients (8 males and 3 females) also with no gender difference (P\u00a0=\u00a00.667). The average interval from first diagnosis to metastasis was 36.45 months. Conclusions: Extremity GCT may have a male predominance in Chinese population and mostly occur at 20\u201340 years of age and around the knee. Follow-ups for GCT patients should be carried on for at least 3 years after primary surgery according to the average intervals for possible local recurrence and pulmonary metastasis.",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in two allergy-related genes [interleukin (IL)-4R\u03b1, IL-13] have been implicated in susceptibility to glioma; however, results from the published studies remained inconclusive. Methods: To derive a more precise relationship, we conducted a meta-analysis including seven case\u2013control studies that investigated the influence of IL-4R\u03b1 rs1801275 and IL13 rs20541 polymorphisms on glioma risk. Data were extracted from these studies and pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to investigate the strength of the association. Results: Overall, the pooled analysis showed that there was no significant association between the IL-4R\u03b1 rs1801275 polymorphism and glioma risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.99, 95%CI: 0.79\u20131.25, AG/GG vs. AA). However, we found that the IL13 rs20541 variant genotypes (GA/AA) were significantly associated with reduced risk for glioma (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.85, 95%CI: 0.75\u20130.97, GA/AA vs. GG). In the stratified analyses by ethnicity, marginally significant association between the IL13 rs20541 polymorphism and decreased glioma risk was found among Asian populations in dominant models (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.84, 95%CI: 0.70\u20131.00, GA/AA vs. GG). Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that the IL13 rs20541 but not the IL-4R\u03b1 rs1801275 polymorphism may be a genetic predictor for glioma. More studies with larger sample size are warranted to further elucidate the impact of the IL13 rs20541 polymorphism on glioma risk.",

We analyzed 13 haplotype blocks in eight of these genes to estimate the breast cancer risk conferred by individual haplotypes. Methods: Haplotype blocks were constructed with 48 tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) identified in eight breast cancer susceptibility genes, TP53, PTEN, CHEK2, ATM, NBS1, RAD50, BRIP1, and PALB2. Genotyping was performed by SNPscan on 734 female patients and 672 female age-matched controls. Results: Forty-five tSNPs were successfully genotyped by SNPscan, and call rates for each tSNP were above 98.9%. Thirteen haplotype blocks of eight genes were constructed with 41 successfully genotyped tSNPs. We found that seven haplotypes from four haplotype blocks located within three genes (NBS1, PTEN, and BRIP1) were significantly associated with breast cancer risk. Among these, four haplotypes (ATC in block 1 of NBS1, GCCCC and GCCCT in block 2 of NBS1, and GCT in block 2 of BRIP1) were correlated with breast cancer risk in sporadic cases (OR (95% CI) 1.350(1.124\u20131.623), 0.752(0.584\u20130.969), 0.803(0.649\u20130.993), and 0.776(0.604\u20130.997), respectively), and only one haplotype (GGCCT in block 2 of NBS1) was significantly associated with breast cancer risk in familial and early-onset cases (OR(95% CI) 1.902(1.134\u20133.191)). Conclusions: Four haplotypes within two genes (NBS1 and BRIP1) involved in the monoubiquitinated FANCD2\u2013DNA damage\u2013repair pathway are significantly associated with increased sporadic breast cancer risk, while one haplotype within NBS1 is correlated with an increased risk of familial or early-onset breast cancer, indicating that specific haplotypes may be distinct predictors of breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Background: Both small and large body size at birth are now known to predict a range of chronic disorders in adult life, including certain cancers. These associations are thought to reflect \u201cfetal programming.\u201d This may lead to impairment of a small number of key systems including the immune system. Hodgkin's lymphoma is a disease of the immune system. We have therefore examined the association between Hodgkin's lymphoma and early development. Our hypothesis was that the disease would be associated with markers of poor fetal growth, specifically small body size or small placental size at birth. Methods: Using the Finnish Cancer Registry we identified patients with Hodgkin's disease in a cohort of 20,431 people born in Helsinki during 1924\u201344. Each person has a detailed birth record. Results: There were 12 patients with Hodgkin's disease, giving an incidence comparable to international rates. The disease was associated with prolonged gestation. For every additional week of gestation the hazard ratio was 1.37 (95% CI 1.00\u20131.87; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). The disease was also associated with a short placental surface. After allowing for gestation, for each centimetre increase in surface length, the hazard ratio was 0.70 (0.53\u20130.92; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The disease was not associated with birth weight or length or maternal body size. Conclusions: We have shown that Hodgkin's lymphoma is associated with prolonged gestation and a short length of the placental surface. We speculate that Hodgkin's lymphoma is initiated by two events in fetal life. One, which is an immune event, is associated with prolonged gestation, while the other is associated with growth faltering.",

     "abstract": "Background: Epidemiological studies have identified potentially modifiable risks for colorectal cancer, including alcohol intake, diet and a sedentary lifestyle. Modelling these environmental factors alongside genetic risk is critical in obtaining accurate estimates of disease risk and improving our understanding of behavioural modifications. Methods: 14 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms identified though GWAS studies and reported on by the international consortium COGENT were used to model genetic disease risk at a population level. Six well validated environmental risks were selected for modelling together with the genetic risk factors (alcohol intake; smoking; exercise levels; BMI; fibre intake and consumption of red and processed meat). Through a simulation study using risk modelling software, we assessed the potential impact of behavioural modifications on disease risk. Results: Modelling the genetic data alone leads to 24% of the population being classified as reduced risk; 60% average risk; 10% elevated risk and 6% high risk for colorectal cancer. Adding alcohol consumption to the model reduced the elevated and high risk categories to 9% and 5% respectively. The simulation study suggests that a substantial proportion of individuals could reduce their disease risk profile by altering their behaviour, including reclassification of over 62% of heavy drinkers. Conclusion: Modelling lifestyle factors alongside genetic risk can provide useful strategies to select individuals for screening for colorectal cancer risk. Impact: Quantifying the impact of moderating behaviour, particularly related to alcohol intake and obesity levels, is beneficial for informing health campaigns and tailoring prevention strategies.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: The effectiveness of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs depends on repeated participation. Little is known on later rounds in programs that use the fecal immunochemical test (FIT), in particular whether previous participants are likely to participate again, and if non-participants persist in declining. We compared overall participation in a second round to that in a first round, and evaluated differences in participation rates based on previous response. Methods: Asymptomatic persons aged 50\u201374 years were invited to a second round of a FIT-based CRC screening pilot. We assessed the participation rate overall and within second round subgroups of previous participants, previous non-participants, and first time invitees. We also assessed whether participation rates were similar for males and females and for age groups. Results: In the first screening round, 2871 of 5309 invitees returned the FIT (participation rate of 57%). This was higher than in the second in which 3187 of 5925 participated (54%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0008). Second round participation rate was 85% (2034/2385) among previous participants, 18% (325/1826) among previous non-participants and 48% (828/1714) among first time invitees (p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Overall, males and persons aged under 55 were less likely to participate. Conclusions: Participation in a second round of FIT-screening was significantly lower than in the first round, largely due to a drop in participation in first round participants, and a relatively low response among first time invitees. This loss of uptake was partially compensated by a willingness to be screened in previous non-participants.",

     "abstract": "Background: Acute leukemia is the most common cancer in children under 15 years of age; 80% are acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 17% are acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Childhood leukemia shows further diversity based on cytogenetic and molecular characteristics, which may relate to distinct etiologies. Case\u2013control studies conducted worldwide, particularly of ALL, have collected a wealth of data on potential risk factors and in some studies, biospecimens. There is growing evidence for the role of infectious/immunologic factors, fetal growth, and several environmental factors in the etiology of childhood ALL. The risk of childhood leukemia, like other complex diseases, is likely to be influenced both by independent and interactive effects of genes and environmental exposures. While some studies have analyzed the role of genetic variants, few have been sufficiently powered to investigate gene\u2013environment interactions. Objectives: The Childhood Leukemia International Consortium (CLIC) was established in 2007 to promote investigations of rarer exposures, gene\u2013environment interactions and subtype-specific associations through the pooling of data from independent studies. Methods: By September 2012, CLIC included 22 studies (recruitment period: 1962\u2013present) from 12 countries, totaling approximately 31\u00a0000 cases and 50\u00a0000 controls. Of these, 19 case\u2013control studies have collected detailed epidemiologic data, and DNA samples have been collected from children and child\u2013parent trios in 15 and 13 of these studies, respectively. Two registry-based studies and one study comprising hospital records routinely obtained at birth and/or diagnosis have limited interview data or biospecimens. Conclusions: CLIC provides a unique opportunity to fill gaps in knowledge about the role of environmental and genetic risk factors, critical windows of exposure, the effects of gene\u2013environment interactions and associations among specific leukemia subtypes in different ethnic groups.",

     "abstract": "Background: District-level cancer incidence estimation is an important issue in countries without a national cancer registry. This study aims to both evaluate the validity of district-level estimations in France for 24 cancer sites, using health insurance data (ALD demands \u2013 Affection de Longue Dur\u00e9e) and to provide estimations when considered valid. Incidence is estimated at a district-level by applying the ratio between the number of first ALD demands and incident cases (ALD/I ratio), observed in those districts with cancer registries, to the number of first ALD demands available in all districts. These district-level estimations are valid if the ratio does not vary greatly across the districts or if variations remain moderate compared with variations in incidence rates. Methods: Validation was performed in the districts covered by cancer registries over the period 2000\u20132005. The district variability of the ALD/I ratio was studied, adjusted for age (mixed-effects Poisson model), and compared with the district variability in incidence rate. The epidemiological context is also considered in addition to statistical analyses. Results: District-level estimation using the ALD/I ratio was considered valid for eight cancer sites out of the 24 studied (lip\u2013oral cavity\u2013pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon\u2013rectum, lung, breast, ovary and testis) and incidence maps were provided for these cancer sites. Conclusion: Estimating cancer incidence at a sub-national level remains a difficult task without a national registry and there are few studies on this topic. Our validation approach may be applied in other countries, using health insurance or hospital discharge data as correlate of incidence.",

Materials and methods: Open cohort study to validate QCancer\u00ae (Renal) prediction model. Record from 365 practices from United Kingdom contributing to The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database. 2.1 million patients registered with a general practice surgery between 01 January 2000 and 30 June 2008, aged 30\u201384 years (3.7 million person years) with 2283 renal tract cancer cases. Renal tract cancer was defined as incident diagnosis of renal tract cancer during the 2 years after study entry. Model discrimination was measured using the receiver operating characteristics derived area under the curve. Calibration plots examined the relationship between predicted and observed probabilities of undetected renal tract cancer. Results: The results from this independent and external validation of QCancer\u00ae (Renal) demonstrated good performance data on a large cohort of general practice patients. QCancer\u00ae (Renal) had very good discrimination with areas under the ROC curve of 0.92 and 0.95 for women and men respectively. QCancer\u00ae (Renal) was well calibrated across all tenths of risk and over all age ranges with predicted risks closely matching observed risks. QCancer\u00ae (Renal) explained 74.4% and 74.2% of the variation in men and women respectively. A limitation of our study is the recording of symptoms might be less complete, as patients with mild symptoms may not visit their general practitioner or not report mild symptoms. Conclusions: QCancer\u00ae (Renal) are useful tools to help in identifying undetected cases of undiagnosed renal tract cancer in primary care in the UK.",

We used Bayesian methods to perform sensitivity analyses for assessing the robustness of study findings to the potential effect of these two important sources of bias. Methods: We used data from a study of the joint associations of radiotherapy and smoking with primary lung cancer among breast cancer survivors. We used Bayesian methods to provide an operational way to combine both validation data and expert opinion to account for misclassification of the two risk factors and missing data. For comparative purposes we considered a \u201cfull model\u201d that allowed for both misclassification and missing data, along with alternative models that considered only misclassification or missing data, and the na\u00efve model that ignored both sources of bias. Results: We identified noticeable differences between the four models with respect to the posterior distributions of the odds ratios that described the joint associations of radiotherapy and smoking with primary lung cancer. Despite those differences we found that the general conclusions regarding the pattern of associations were the same regardless of the model used. Overall our results indicate a nonsignificantly decreased lung cancer risk due to radiotherapy among nonsmokers, and a mildly increased risk among smokers. Conclusions: We described easy to implement Bayesian methods to perform sensitivity analyses for assessing the robustness of study findings to misclassification and missing data.",

     "abstract": "Background: Sun exposure habits and the propensity to undertake sun protection differ between individuals. Not least in primary prevention of skin cancer, aiming at reducing ultraviolet (UV) exposure, knowledge about these factors may be of importance. The aim of the present study was to investigate, in a primary health care (PHC) population, the relationship between sun exposure habits/sun protection behaviour/readiness to increase sun protection and gender, age, educational level and skin UV-sensitivity. Methods: The baseline data from a previously performed RCT on skin cancer prevention was used. 415 patients, aged >18 years, visiting a PHC centre in southern Sweden, filled-out a questionnaire mapping sun exposure, readiness to increase sun protection according to the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change (TTM), and the above mentioned factors. Results: Female gender was associated with more frequent suntanning (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and sunbed use (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but also with more extensive sunscreen use (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). High age was in general associated with low level of sun exposure and high level of protection. Subjects with low educational level reported less frequent sunscreen use than those with higher educational level, and also chose lower SPF (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). For almost all parameters, high skin UV-sensitivity was associated with markedly lower sun exposure (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and more pronounced readiness to increase sun protection. Females and subjects with high educational level reported higher readiness to increase sunscreen use than males and subjects with lower educational level (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Conclusions: Gender, age, educational level and skin type appear to be important factors affecting sun exposure habits and sun protection behaviour, which supports the idea of appropriate mapping of these factors in patients in order to individualise sun protection advice according to the individual patient situation and capabilities.",

Cigarette smoking has been recognized as an important risk factor, but the relation to other potential determinants is still inconsistent. We investigated the association between different lifestyle, biological and anthropometric factors and the risk of pancreatic cancer in a prospective population-based cohort study from Kaunas, Lithuania. Methods: Our study included 7132 urban men initially free from any diagnosed cancer, followed for up to 30 years. 77 incident cases of pancreatic cancer were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Results: Compared to never smokers, current smokers had a significantly increased risk of pancreatic cancer, HR was 1.79 (95% CI 1.03\u20133.09) after adjustment for age, body mass index, education and alcohol consumption. Among smokers, a significant association with higher smoking intensity was shown (\u226520\u00a0cigarettes/day: HR\u00a0=\u00a02.60; 95% CI 1.42\u20134.76, Ptrend\u00a0=\u00a00.046).

Alcohol consumption, body mass index and total cholesterol level were not significantly associated with pancreatic cancer. Conclusions: Smoking significantly increases pancreatic cancer incidence and its high prevalence in Lithuania may partly explain high incidence of the disease. No convincing evidence was found that alcohol consumption, body mass index or serum cholesterol level were associated with pancreatic cancer risk, although the assessment was limited by the lack of statistical power.",

     "abstract": "Background: Several reports point to inverse associations between allergies and ALL; yet, no study has explored this link using both self-reported-data on allergic history and biomarkers of atopic sensitization. Methods: Clinical information for the variables of interest was available for 252 out of 292 cases of childhood (0\u201314 years) ALL, newly diagnosed across Greece over a 4.5 year period as well as for 294 hospital controls. Allergen-specific-IgEs, as markers of allergic predisposition, against 24 most prevalent respiratory and food allergens, were determined, using an enzyme immunoassay procedure for 199 children with ALL and 113 controls. Cases were compared with controls through frequency distributions and unconditional multiple logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence-intervals (CIs) regarding associations of allergy with childhood ALL. Results: Self-reported-allergic history overall (OR: 0.49, 95%CI: 0.34\u20130.72) and practically each one of its main components (respiratory, food, any other clinical allergy) were strongly and inversely associated with ALL. Likewise, the serum IgE inverse association was of the same magnitude (OR: 0.43, 95%CI: 0.22\u20130.84) mainly contributed by food IgE (OR: 0.39, 95%CI: 0.18\u20130.83). Conclusion: Beyond the already established inverse association of allergic history with childhood ALL, a same magnitude association is evident when serologic markers of allergic predisposition are used as an alternative measure of allergy. Further research with more appropriate study designs is needed to better understand possible associations between prior allergy and childhood ALL risk.",

However, the role of germline genetic variants in this complex in relation to cancer risk is not well studied. Methods: We assessed the association of 16 variants in the catalytic subunits (SMARCA2 and SMARCA4) of the SWI/SNF complex with the risk of glioma subtypes (lower grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and glioblastoma [GBM]) and with mortality from high-grade tumors (GBM) in a multicenter US case\u2013control study that included 561 cases and 574 controls.

The association of PDSS2 and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been known. Methods: To investigate its association with NSCLC, we examined the expression level of PDSS2 in 28 paired clinical samples of non-small cell lung cancer tissues and surrounding normal tissues. Results: PDSS2 was constitutionally expressed in normal lung tissues regardless of sex, race and smoking history. An overall decreased PDSS2 expression was found in the tumor tissues compared to surrounding normal tissues. Decrease in PDSS2 expression was more severe in poorly and poor-to-moderately differentiated lung cancers, while the decrease was not significant in moderately to well-differentiated tumors. Moreover, the expression of PDSS2 decreased more in higher pathological stage, and in patients with lymph node metastasis. The decrease in PDSS2 expression in tumor tissues was not related to sex or histological type of NSCLC, but was related to smoking history. No correlation has been found between PDSS2 and the clinical factors of EGRF, Ki-67 and p53. Conclusion: Taken together, decreased expression of PDSS2 in NSCLC was evident. This is an initial report for the expression of PDSS2 in relation to different factors in lung cancer. Loss of PDSS2 could serve as a potential biomarker in NSCLC development.

More importantly, the ORP150\u2013E749\u201357 complex plus poly(I:C) vaccine format demonstrated more potent anti-tumor effects than ORP150\u2013E749\u201357 complex alone or E749\u201357 plus poly(I:C) in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice. Conclusion: Both poly(I:C) and ORP150 chaperone can synergistically enhance the anti-tumor effects of the HPV16E749\u201357-based vaccine in vitro and in vivo. This strategy provides a platform for the design of a tumor therapeutic vaccine capable of inducing an effective anti-tumor immune response.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic features and prognostic significance of AEG-1 in squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue (TSCC). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to examine AEG-1 protein expression in paraffin-embedded tissues from 93 patients with TSCC. Real-time PCR and western blot analyses were employed to examine AEG-1 expression in 4 pairs of primary TSCC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues from the same patient. Immunohistochemical results revealed that the positive rate for AEG-1 in TSCC tissues (48.39%, 45/93) was higher than that in the normal tongue tissues (10.00%, 3/30) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). These results were further confirmed between TSCC tissues and matched adjacent non-cancerous tissues by Western blot and RT-PCR. Simultaneously, AEG-1 protein level was positively correlated with differentiation degree (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), clinical stage (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), T classification (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and N classification (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012). Furthermore, patients with higher AEG-1 expression had shorter overall survival time. Multivariate analysis (Cox regression) also suggested that AEG-1 expression was an independent prognostic indicator for TSCC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). Our results indicate that AEG-1 expression is closely associated with carcinogenesis and progression of TSCC, and may represent a novel and valuable predictor for prognostic evaluation of TSCC patients.",

Methods: One hundred and seventy patients with pancreatic cancer were diagnosed and treated in the decade 2001\u20132010 (100 males and 70 females, with a mean age of 65.8 years [range, 36\u201391]). Patients were staged with spiral computed tomography and 75% were found to have advanced disease (28 stage III, 99 stage IV disease). Ductal adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in 147 cases, other subtypes of carcinoma in the remaining 23. Fifty patients were operated with radical intent, 19 had palliative surgery, 101 were considered inoperable because of advanced disease or heavy anesthesiologic risk; 31 of these inoperable patients underwent biliary decompression by insertion of an endoluminal or percutaneous stent. Gemcitabine-containing regimens were administered to 143 patients and radiotherapy was combined in 19. Overall and relative survival were the parameters studied. Multivariate analysis was performed by multiple regressions applied to proportional-hazards model. Results: From all the clinical, pathological and therapeutical factors evaluated the statistically significant ones were time to diagnosis and surgery. Among symptoms pain was related to the shortest mean time to diagnosis, weight loss to the longest, with corresponding differences in survival. These differences of observed survival were substantially confirmed in terms of relative survival. Conclusions: The poor prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma seems to depend, in part, on diagnostic delay and this, in turn, is influenced by the type of presenting symptoms.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: To evaluate the safety profile of new drugs, it is important to quantify the rates of adverse events (AE). There has been little to no research on the safety of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors in population-based settings. The purpose of this study was to further the understanding of the incidence of AEs in a population-based representative cancer population receiving VEGF inhibitors where there currently is a deep lack of knowledge. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from an administrative claims database between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010. Patients were included into the study if they had at least two malignant primary cancer diagnoses codes (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM]: 140\u2013209 [not including 196\u2013199.0]) from the same cancer site and a prescription for a VEGF inhibitor. We estimated the incidence rate (IR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each adverse event under study. Results: 2326 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The mean age for the cohort was 57.3 where 79% of the patients were 50 years of age or older. The most common adverse event was nausea and vomiting (IR\u00a0=\u00a0651.7/1000 person-years; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0589.7\u2013718.4). Other common adverse events were hypertension (IR\u00a0=\u00a0452.9/1000 person-years; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0394.9\u2013517.1) and hemorrhage (IR\u00a0=\u00a0375.2/1000 person-years; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0332.2\u2013422.3). The least common adverse events were rare dermatologic diseases such as Stevens\u2013Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis where no cases were observed. Conclusions: The rates detailed in this analysis are helpful in understanding the benefit risk of VEGF inhibitors as they are prescribed in the real world. Although no formal comparisons were conducted, the VEGF inhibitors evaluated in this study appeared to have overlapping toxicity profiles; however, the manner in which these AEs are listed in the prescribing information was not always consistent.",

Each year more than 5 million smokers die prematurely because of their habit wreaking havoc on the welfare of families and communities worldwide. While cigarettes remain the main tobacco killer worldwide, for many youth tobacco use and addiction is maintained by means other than cigarettes. In particular, over the past decade, waterpipe smoking (a.k.a. hookah, shisha, narghile) has become increasingly popular among youth in the Middle East, and is rapidly spreading globally. Available evidence suggests that waterpipe smoking is associated with many of the known risks of tobacco smoking, particularly cancer. Despite these worrisome signs, policies and interventions to address this emerging public health problem have been lagging behind. In this short review I discuss briefly the evidence generated mostly in the past decade about the global spread of waterpipe smoking and its cancer risk potential.",

Methods: We computed the age-standardized and age-specific incidence (per 100,000 individuals) of EC during 1992\u20132005 using the World Standard Population as reference. The percent changes for age-standardized rates (ASR), from 1992\u20131996 to 2001\u20132005, were calculated. The relative risks (RR) and the standardized rate ratios (SRR) were estimated, along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: The ASR of adenocarcinomas (AC) showed increases for most racial/ethnic groups from 1992\u20131996 to 2001\u20132005. All racial/ethnic groups showed ASR reductions for squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). For both sexes, PRs had lower AC incidences than NHW and USH but higher than NHB. For those younger than 80 years of age, PR men showed higher SCC incidences than NHW but lower than NHB (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The incidence of SCC was about two times higher in PR men than USH men (SRR: 2.16; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.65\u20132.88). Among women, the RR for SCC increased with age when comparing PRs to groups in the US. Conclusion: Incidence disparities were observed between PRs and other racial/ethnic groups in the US. These differences and trends may reflect lifestyles of each racial/ethnic group. Further studies are warranted to explain these disparities.",

It is important, in terms of the validity of these studies, to have accurate cause of death information. However, it is well documented that cause of death information taken from death certificates is often lacking in accuracy and completeness. Methods: We assess through use of a simulation study the effect of under and over-recording of cancer on death certificates in a competing risks analysis consisting of three competing causes of death: cancer, heart disease and other causes. Using realistic levels of misclassification, we consider 24 scenarios and examine the bias in the cause-specific hazard ratios and the cumulative incidence function. Results: The bias in the cumulative incidence function was highest in the oldest age group reaching values as high as 2.6 percentage units for the \u201cgood\u201d cancer prognosis scenario and 9.7 percentage units for the \u201cpoor\u201d prognosis scenario. Conclusion: The bias resulting from the chosen levels of misclassification in this study accentuate concerns that unreliable cause of death information may be providing misleading results.

     "abstract": "Background: In order to ensure accurate survival estimates, population-based cancer registries must ascertain all, or nearly all, patients diagnosed with cancer in their catchment area, and obtain complete follow-up information on all deaths that occurred among registered cancer patients. In the US, linkage with state death records may not be sufficient to ascertain all deaths. Since 1979, all state vital statistics offices have reported their death certificate information to the National Death Index (NDI). Objective: This study was designed to measure the impact of linkage with the NDI on population-based relative and cancer cause-specific survival rates in the US. Methods: Central cancer registry records for patients diagnosed 1993\u20131995 from California, Colorado, and Idaho were linked with death certificate information (deaths 1993\u20132004) from their individual state vital statistics offices and with the NDI. Two databases were created: one contained incident records with deceased patients linked only to state death records and the second database contained incident records with deceased patients linked to both state death records and the NDI. Survival estimates and 95% confidence intervals from each database were compared by state and primary site category. Results: At 60 months follow-up, 42.1\u201348.1% of incident records linked with state death records and an additional 0.7\u20133.4% of records linked with the NDI. Survival point estimates from the analysis without NDI were not contained within the corresponding 95% CIs from the NDI augmented analysis for all sites combined and colorectal, pancreas, lung and bronchus, breast, prostate, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma cases in all 3 states using relative survival methods. Additional combinations of state and primary site had significant survival estimate differences, which differed by method (relative versus cause-specific survival). Conclusion: To ensure accurate population-based cancer survival rates, linkage with the National Death Index to ascertain out of state and late registered deaths is a necessary process for US central cancer registries.",

Methods: This retrospective cohort study utilized the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results database. 2780 patients were identified; including 383 patients diagnosed \u226540 years. Patient characteristics between age groups were compared using chi-squared tests. Survival from diagnosis to death was estimated via Kaplan\u2013Meier methods, compared with log-rank tests, and modeled using multivariable Cox methods. A competing risks analysis was performed to evaluate death due to cancer. Results: Patients \u226540 years of age were more likely to have extra-skeletal tumors (66.1% vs. 31.7%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), axial tumors (64.0% vs. 57.2%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and metastatic disease at diagnosis (35.5% vs. 30.0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) compared to younger patients. Five-year survival for those age \u226540 and age <40 were 40.6% and 54.3%, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

Methods: Data on patients resident in England diagnosed with primary liver cancer (ICD-10 C22) between 2001 and 2007 were extracted from the National Cancer Data Repository. Age-standardised incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for different ethnic groups separately for males and females, using the White ethnic groups as baselines. Overall survival was analysed using Cox regression, adjusting sequentially for age, socioeconomic deprivation and co-morbidity. Results: Ethnicity data were available for 75% (13,139/17,458) of primary liver cancer patients. Compared with the White male baseline, Chinese males had the highest IRR. Black African, Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men also had statistically significant high IRRs. Black Caribbean men had a marginally elevated incidence rate compared with White men. In comparison with White women, Pakistani women had the highest IRR. Bangladeshi, Chinese, Black African and Indian women also had high IRRs. As observed in men, Black Caribbean women had an incidence rate closer to that of White women. Pakistani men and women, Black African women and Chinese men had statistically significantly better survival compared with their White counterparts. Conclusion: The variation found in the incidence of primary liver cancer, could be due to established risk factors such as hepatitis B and C infection being more prevalent among certain ethnic groups.

However, the results of these studies are inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis in order to identify any potential association. Methods: PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched to identify relevant articles that investigated the risk of meningioma following cigarette smoking. Two researchers evaluated study eligibility and extracted the data independently, and disagreements were resolved by discussion. The variables used to estimate the pooled risk of smoking in meningioma development were the multivariate-adjusted risk estimates presented in the literature. Results: Seven case\u2013control and two cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis. The pooled estimated risks associated with ever smoking for meningioma were 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85\u20131.21) in the case\u2013control studies, 0.93 (95% CI: 0.83\u20131.04) in the cohort studies and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.87\u20131.05, P\u00a0=\u00a00.32) in all studies when the cohort and case\u2013control data were combined.

However, missing data on tumor thickness may lead to biased analyses in this frequently used database. We sought to characterize invasive melanomas with unknown thickness with emphasis on their association with melanoma survival, and to employ techniques to overcome the limitations of missing data on tumor thickness. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of non-occult invasive melanomas in the SEER database from 1989 to 2008. Results: Of 182\u00a0184 cases, 24\u00a0329 (13%) had unknown thickness.

Melanoma survival of cases with unknown thickness appeared most similar to 2.01\u20134.00\u00a0mm thickness cases. Multiple imputation demonstrated that imputed tumor thickness was significantly associated with melanoma survival (HR 1.31, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.32) and Clark level (odds ratio [OR] 1.85, 95% CI: 1.82, 1.89) though the strength of associations were not as strong as the associations of original SEER-coded known tumor thickness with melanoma survival (HR 1.46, 95% CI: 1.45, 1.47) and Clark level (OR 2.92, 95% CI 2.89, 2.95), respectively. Conclusions: Exclusion of missing data on melanoma thickness from SEER introduces a selection bias that leads to an underestimation in the prevalence of fatal and likely thicker melanomas. Multiple imputation appears to be an effective tool to predict missing tumor thickness data.",

In this study, we demonstrated the expression of TRIM28 gene was significantly higher in cancerous tissues than in noncancerous tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). TRIM28 knockdown resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation in liquid media as well as in soft agar. The proliferation rate was impaired and the cell cycle progression was inhibited after knockdown of TRIM28 in non-small cell lung cancer cell lines PAa and SK-MES-1. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect circulating cancer cells in 138 non-small cell lung cancer patients. The overall positive detection rate was 30.4% (42 of 138) in peripheral blood of NSCLC patients and was 29.9% (29 of 97) in early-stage patients. In a 70-month follow-up study, 20 of 29 patients (69.0%) in TRIM28 positive group had recurrence and/or metastasis, significantly higher (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) than in the TRIM28 negative group (25 of 68, 36.8%). In addition, non-small cell lung cancer patients whose circulating cancer cells expressed TRIM28 suffered shorter tumor-specific survival compared with those with absent TRIM28 expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Results of our study showed that TRIM28 provides a survival advantage to lung cancer cells and may be a new marker to predict metastasis and prognosis in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "Background & aim: Human kinesin superfamily proteins (KIFs) are a conserved class of microtubule-dependent molecular motor proteins with adenosine triphosphatase activity and motion characteristics. As a member of KIFs, KIF14 plays an important role in the regulation of cell cycle and mitotic progression. Deregulation of KIF14 has been found in several human malignancies and also has been demonstrated to be involved in tumor progression and related to patient survival. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance of KIF14 expression in glioma. Methods: Real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay was performed to detect KIF14 mRNA expression, and Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses were performed to detect KIF14 protein expression in human gliomas and non-neoplastic brain tissues, respectively. Then, the association of KIF14 immunostaining with clinicopathological factors and prognosis of glioma patients was also statistically analyzed. Results: KIF14 mRNA and protein expression were respectively increased 5.5- and 4.2-fold on average in glioma tissues relative to non-neoplastic brain tissues (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Additionally, both KIF14 mRNA and protein expression increased with ascending pathological grade. Then, the high KIF14 immunostaining in glioma tissues was significantly associated with advanced pathological grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008), low Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02), high mitotic index (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and Ki-67 index (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Furthermore, both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses determined that KIF14 overexpression effectively predicted decreased overall survival in patients with gliomas. Conclusions: These findings offer the first convinced evidence that KIF14 expression in gliomas is tumor-specific and increased in more aggressive tumors. KIF14 might function as a candidate prognostic marker for human gliomas.",

Our aim was to evaluate the association of false-positive results with the cancer detection risk in subsequent screening participations over a 17-year period. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 762,506 women aged 45\u201369 years, with at least two screening participations, who underwent 2,594,146 screening mammograms from 1990 to 2006. Multilevel discrete-time hazard models were used to estimate the adjusted odds ratios (OR) of breast cancer detection in subsequent screening participations in women with false-positive results. Results: False-positives involving a fine-needle aspiration cytology or a biopsy had a higher cancer detection risk than those involving additional imaging procedures alone (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.69; 95%CI: 2.28\u20133.16 and OR\u00a0=\u00a01.81; 95%CI: 1.70\u20131.94, respectively). The risk of cancer detection increased substantially if women with cytology or biopsy had a familial history of breast cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.64; 95%CI: 3.23\u20136.66). Other factors associated with an increased cancer detection risk were age 65\u201369 years (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.84; 95%CI: 1.67\u20132.03), non-attendance at the previous screening invitation (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.26; 95%CI: 1.11\u20131.43), and having undergone a previous benign biopsy outside the screening program (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.24; 95%CI: 1.13\u20131.35).

Methods: We analyse the impact of different factors on transitions after pancreatic resection based on a multi state model. Results: Transitions of interest include the transition to death/discharge with/without complications after pancreatic resection. We consider presence of comorbidities, higher age (>60), gender-male, lower hospital volume (<10 cases per year), type of surgery, localization of tumour and transfusion received as covariates with a potentially negative effect on the transition intensities to death with or without complications. Conclusions: The multi-state model allows for a very detailed analysis of the impact of covariates on each transition, since effects of covariates may change depending on the current state of the patient, thus helping surgeons and patients throughout the surgical process and counselling patients if needed.",

     "abstract": "Background: A rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer has been reported in several countries, and the increase is only seen in the papillary type. Increased detection due to higher resolution ultrasound and fine needle aspiration has been proposed as the explanation, recent registry studies however question this assumption. Methods: National, unselected, prospective cohort study of 1350 papillary thyroid cancer patients in Denmark from 1996 to 2008. Objective: To analyze changes in incidence by time and to identify factors which might influence detection rate. Results: A rise in incidence is seen with age standardized ratios increasing from 1.43 per 100.000 per year in 1996 to 2.16 per 100.000 per year in 2008. The median age at presentation was 46 years and median tumor size was 18\u00a0mm. Male/female ratio was 1/2.9. By dichotomizing the material in a time period before and after the 30th of June 2001, no significant change in the proportion of diagnosed tumors smaller than 1 or 2\u00a0cm was found, and 42.8% of the rise in incidence was explained by tumors larger than 2\u00a0cm. No significant change in diagnostic use of ultrasound or fine needle aspiration was found, and a significant change toward more extensive thyroid surgery could not be confirmed. Conclusion: This study shows a significant rise in incidence of papillary thyroid carcinoma in Denmark from 1996 to 2008, which is not explained by increased use of preoperative diagnostic modalities. Other reasons need to be considered.",

Data for primary malignant oesophageal cancer diagnosed in 1995\u20131999 and followed up to the end of 2003 was obtained from 66 cancer registries in 24 European countries. Relative survival was calculated using the Hakulinen approach. Staging data were available from 19 registries. Survival by region, gender, age, morphology and stage was investigated. Cohort analysis and the period approach were applied to investigate survival trends from 1988 to 2002 for 31 registries in 17 countries. In total 51,499 cases of oesophageal cancer diagnosed 1995\u20131999 were analysed. Overall, European 1- and 5-year survival rates were 33.4% (95% CI 32.9\u201333.9%) and 9.8% (95% CI 9.4\u201310.1%), respectively. Males, older patients and patients with late stage disease had poorer 1- and 5-year relative survival. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma had poorer 1-year relative survival. Regional variation in survival was observed with Central Europe above and Eastern Europe below the European pool. Survival for distant stage disease was similar across Europe while survival rates for localised disease were below the European pool in Eastern and Southern Europe. Improvement in European 1-year relative survival was reported (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). Oesophageal cancer survival was poor across Europe. Persistent regional variations in 1-year survival point to a need for a high resolution study of diagnostic and treatment practices of oesophageal cancer.",

With this aim a cohort study was set up of 14- to 16-year-old girls eligible for HPV vaccination in the Netherlands. Annually, HPV-DNA and antibody status in vaginal self-samples and in serum respectively, will be studied among vaccinated (58%) and unvaccinated girls (42%). Here we present baseline data on vaginal HPV-DNA status in relation to serum antibodies. Methods: The 1800 enrolled girls filled out an internet-based questionnaire and provided a vaginal self-sample for genotype specific HPV-DNA detection using SPF10 PCR amplification and reverse line probe hybridization. Furthermore, 64% of the girls provided a blood sample for HPV antibody analysis. IgG antibodies against virus-like particles were determined for 7 HPV genotypes. Results: At baseline, type-specific HPV-DNA was detected in 4.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a079) of the 1800 girls: 2.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a049) concerned a high risk HPV type (hrHPV-DNA). The three most common types were HPV type 16, 18 and 51 (40%). Out of the hrHPV-DNA positive girls, 32% was seropositive vs. 12% in HPV-DNA negative girls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Risk factors independently associated with hrHPV-DNA infection among the sexually active girls were age >15 years vs. 14\u201315 years (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.6 (1.2\u20135.9)), age of sexual debut <14 vs. above 14 years (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.0 (1.1\u20138.2)), total number of lifetime partners above two vs. less than two partners (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.2 (1.3\u20138.0)) and age of partner >17 vs. under 17 years (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.2 (1.5\u201313.0)). Conclusion: A low hrHPV-DNA prevalence was found in the adolescent girls. The observed vs. expected age-related increase in HPV-DNA prevalence in this cohort in the coming years (with increased sexual activity) will provide understanding of the effect of HPV vaccination. Furthermore, this cohort study will offer the opportunity to improve knowledge of antibody responses following natural infection and vaccination.",

These variants can be identified through association studies including such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which has led the glioma epidemiology researchers to focus on identifying potential disease-causing factors. Methods: We evaluated and validated 10 tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) in seven genes associated with glioma susceptibility in a Han Chinese population, including 301 glioma cases and 302 controls, using a multiplexed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) MassEXTEND assay. We ascertained the genotypic frequencies for each tSNP in control subjects were within Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) using an exact test, and then compared the genotype and allele frequencies of glioma patients and control subjects using the \u03c72 test. We then applied three genetic models (dominant, recessive, and additive) using PLINK software to assess the association of each tSNP with glioma risk. Results: We identified two tSNPs to be associated with glioma susceptibility (rs1695, GSTP1, P\u00a0=\u00a00.019; rs2853676, TERT, P\u00a0=\u00a00.039), which we confirmed using dominant and additive model analyses.

Multiple imputation was used to provide more reliable estimates of stage at diagnosis, when these data were missing. Cure mixture models were used to estimate the proportion \u2018cured\u2019 and the median survival of the uncured by age and stage. Results: For both colon and rectal cancer the proportion of patients cured and median survival time of the uncured decreased with advancing stage and increasing age. Patients aged under 65 years had the highest proportion cured and longest median survival of the uncured. Conclusion: Cure of colorectal cancer patients is dependent on stage and age at diagnosis with younger patients or those with less advanced disease having a better prognosis. Further efforts are required, in order to reduce the proportion of patients presenting with stage III and IV disease and ultimately increase the chance of cure.",

Patients were followed until December 2008. One-, 5- and 10-year disease-specific survival rates were estimated. Kaplan\u2013Meier and Cox regression models were used to analyse death from breast cancer.At diagnosis 70.2% of tumours were in stages I\u2013II. During follow-up 705 deaths occurred, 58.4% specifically due to breast cancer. Five- and 10-year breast cancer specific survival rates were 83.3% and 73.7%, respectively (stage I, 97.1% and 94.0%; stage II, 88.0% and 79.4%; stage III, 70.1% and 46.3%, and stage IV, 24.5% and 6.1%, respectively). The 5-year disease-specific survival rate increased from 73.5% in 1992\u20131995 to 86.4% in 2001\u20132005 (log rank, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Multivariate analyses showed that prognosis was less favourable for women diagnosed between 1992 and 1995, for those whose route to diagnosis was not the screening programme, women aged \u226570 years, with stage IV tumours, with high grade lesions, and for women who received only palliative or symptomatic treatment. Adjusting for prognostic factors, surgeon's experience did not significantly appeared to affect survival of operated women.In this centre survival from breast cancer improved markedly from 1992 to 2005. Breast cancer prognosis was influenced by both clinical and organisational variables. The quantification of the role of such factors affords valuable knowledge to improve cancer care in settings similar to the study hospital.",

To explore a potential novel biomarker, we examined the cellular and plasma miRNA profiles in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) characterized by diverse clinical features. Methods and results: Using CD4-positive cells isolated from 2 non-infected healthy individuals, 3 chronic ATL patients and 3 acute ATL patients, cellular miRNAs were profiled by microarray. The microarray screened 5 miRNAs namely miR-155, let-7g, miR-126, miR-130a and let-7b because of the large difference in their expression in diseased vs. that of healthy controls. The expression levels of before 5 miRNAs re-quantified by reverse transcription quantifiable polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were not always accordant in cells and plasma. The high and low plasma levels of miR-155 and miR-126 changed with ATL stage. Conclusion: The present study revealed that there is a quantitative discrepancy between cellular and plasma miRNAs. The elevation of plasma miR-155 and the reduction in miR-126 correlated with poor prognosis, indicating their usefulness as a novel biomarker for the assessment of disease stage.",

The aim of this study is to project observed trends of mortality in France for lung and breast cancer among females to 2021. Projections of mortality rates are based on a Bayesian age-period-cohort model and a Poisson distribution. We used cancer mortality data from the French mortality register (period 1977\u20132006) and population data from population registers (estimated for 1977\u20132006 and projected for period 2007\u20132021 using five scenarios: largest, smallest, youngest, older, average population). Alternative models were tested (generalized additive model, negative binomial distribution).For the average population scenario, lung and breast cancer mortality rates age-standardized to the world population, are respectively: 11.5 per 105 women (Credibility interval: 10.3\u201312.8) and 15.9 (14.4\u201317.6) in 2007\u20132011, 14.6 (11.7\u201318.1) and 14.5 (11.6\u201318.0) in 2012\u20132016, 18.2 (12.6\u201326.0) and 13.3 (9.1\u201318.9) in 2017\u20132021.Projections show an ongoing increase for lung cancer and decrease for breast cancer mortality rates, which are expected to be equal in 2012\u20132016.

Published information on the frequency and characteristics of CRPC patients are lacking. This may be partly because there is no specific code which doctors can use to record CRPC, making research in existing data sources such as the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) difficult. Methods: The aim of this study was to firstly develop a method to accurately and thoroughly identify CRPC patients in the GPRD, using a combination of codes for treatments and diagnostic tests which these patients are likely to have received. Secondly, the anonymised electronic medical records were used to study the identified CRPC patient characteristics, such as age, treatments, comorbidity and expected survival. Results: After comprehensive exploratory research, the final algorithm was selected to identify patients\u2019 assumed recording on the GPRD of either a rising prostate specific antigen (PSA) value (clinical definition of CRPC) or evidence of a switch in treatment after castration. Using the algorithm, over the 1999\u20132009 study period, 11\u00a0600 castrated prostate cancer patients were identified. Of these, 3277 (28%) developed CRPC during the study period, with an incidence rate of 8.3 per 100 person years in castrated prostate cancer patients, and 3.8 per 100 person years in all prostate cancer patients. Mean patient age at CRPC was 76.8 years, and mean survival duration from CRPC status was 13.5 months, and from first prostate cancer diagnosis was 48.2 months. The most common comorbidities among CRPC patients were hypertension, dyspnoea, and anaemia. Conclusions: Sensitivity analyses to test algorithms with differing inclusion criteria suggested that the primary algorithm was robust, reducing bias through missing data, while avoiding \u2018false positives\u2019 and retaining clinical credibility. Overall, our study has documented a reliable method for identifying CRPC patients in GPRD, and thus we have been able to characterise these patients more accurately.",

     "abstract": "Aims. We conducted a large registry-based study in California to investigate the association of perinatal factors and childhood leukemia with analysis of two major subtypes, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Methods. We linked California cancer and birth registries to obtain information on 5788 cases and 5788 controls matched on age and sex (1:1). We examined the association of birth weight, gestational age, birth and pregnancy order, parental ages, and specific conditions during pregnancy and risk of total leukemia, ALL and AML using conditional logistic regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. Results. The odds ratio (OR) per 1000\u00a0g increase in birth weight was 1.11 for both total leukemia and ALL. The OR were highest for babies weighing \u22654500\u00a0g with reference <2500\u00a0g: 1.59 (95% CI: 1.05\u20132.40) and 1.70 (95% CI: 1.08\u20132.68) for total leukemia and ALL, respectively. For AML, increase in risk was also observed but the estimate was imprecise due to small numbers. Compared to average-for-gestational age (AGA), large-for-gestational age (LGA) babies were at slightly increased risk of total childhood leukemia (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.10) and both ALL and AML (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.07 and OR\u00a0=\u00a01.13, respectively) but estimates were imprecise. Being small-for-gestational age (SGA) was associated with reduced risk of childhood leukemia (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.81, 95% CI: 0.67\u20130.97) and ALL (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.77, 95% CI: 0.63\u20130.94), but not AML. Being first-born was associated with decreased risk of AML only (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.70; 95% CI: 0.53\u20130.93). Compared to children with paternal age <25 years, children with paternal age between 35 and 45 years were at increased risk of total childhood leukemia (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.12; 95% CI: 1.04\u20131.40) and ALL (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.23; 95% CI: 1.04\u20131.47). None of conditions during pregnancy examined or maternal age were associated with increased risk of childhood leukemia or its subtypes. Conclusions. Our results suggest that high birth weight and LGA were associated with increased risk and SGA with decreased risk of total childhood leukemia and ALL, being first-born was associated with decreased risk of AML, and advanced paternal age was associated with increased risk of ALL. These findings suggest that associations of childhood leukemia and perinatal factors depend highly on subtype of leukemia.",

     "abstract": "One of the most challenging stumbling blocks for the treatment of cancer is the ability of cancer cells to break the natural barriers and spread from its site of origin to non-adjacent regional and distant sites, accounting for high cancer mortality rates. Gamut experimental and epidemiological data advocate the use of pharmacological or nutritional interventions to inhibit or delay various stage(s) of cancer such as invasion and metastasis. Genistein, a promising chemopreventive agent, has gained considerable attention for its powerful anti-carcinogenic, anti-angiogenic and chemosensitizing activities.In this study, the cytotoxic potential of genistein on HeLa cells by cell viability assay and the mode of cell death induced by genistein were determined by nuclear morphological examination, DNA laddering assay and cell cycle analysis. Moreover, to establish its inhibitory effect on migration of HeLa cells, scratch wound assay was performed and these results were correlated with the expression of genes involved in invasion and migration (MMP-9 and TIMP-1) by RT-PCR.The exposure of HeLa cells to genistein resulted in significant dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition, which was found to be mediated by apoptosis and cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. In addition, it induced migration-inhibition in a time-dependent manner by modulating the expression of MMP-9 and TIMP-1.Our results signify that genistein may be an effective anti-neoplastic agent to prevent cancer cell growth and invasion and metastasis.

     "abstract": "Background. Australia's organized cervical screening program recommends two-yearly screening for women aged 18\u201369 years and reminder letters are sent at 27 months. Cervical screening registers hold comprehensive information on screening, but not country of birth. A linkage study was performed in order to assess cervical screening behavior in migrants. Methods. To assess screening participation, we linked year 2000 records for 12,541 Middle Eastern/Asian-born women 20\u201354 years of age, and an age and area matched random sample of 12,143 Australian-born women in the New South Wales (NSW) Midwives Data Collection (MDC), which records country of birth, to screening register records. Screening behavior after 2000 was assessed in women without a recorded prior cervical abnormality. Results. The odds ratios for being screened at least once within a 3 year period, with reference to Australian-born women and adjusted for age, parity, socioeconomic status and smoking, were 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81\u20130.97) and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.70\u20130.79) in women born in the Middle East and Asia, respectively. Screening increased with increasing socioeconomic status (SES), absence of smoking and greater parity in Australian-born women but little, if at all, in migrant women. In a sensitivity analysis in which hospital admitted patients were the source of population samples, some patterns were sufficiently different to suggest that selection for illness can affect the strength and direction of associations in linked data. Conclusion. Migrant women from Asian and Middle-eastern countries are less likely than Australian-born women to participate in cervical screening at the recommended interval. Their likelihood of screening is also less related to socioeconomic status, smoking and parity than that in Australian-born women.",

     "abstract": "Background: The prostate component of the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) randomized screening trial demonstrated no mortality effect of screening. Here we analyze prostate cancer specific survival in PLCO and its relation to screening. Methods: 76,693 men aged 55\u201374 were randomized to usual care (n\u00a0=\u00a038,350) or intervention (n\u00a0=\u00a038,343). Intervention arm men received annual prostate-specific antigen (6 years) and digital rectal exam (4 years). Men were followed for cancer diagnosis and mortality through 13 years. Medical record abstractors confirmed prostate cancer diagnoses, stage and grade. Prostate-specific survival in PLCO cases was analyzed using Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis and proportional hazards modeling. We utilized data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program to compute expected survival in PLCO and compared this to observed. Results: There was no significant difference in prostate-specific survival rates between arms; 10 year survival rates were 94.7% (intervention, n\u00a0=\u00a04250 cases) versus 93.5% (usual care, n\u00a0=\u00a03815 cases). Within the intervention arm, cases never screened in PLCO had lower 10 year survival rates (82%) than screen detected or interval (following a negative screen) cases, both around 95.5%. The ratio of observed to expected 10 year prostate-specific death (1-survival) rates was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.51\u20130.68) for all PLCO cases, 0.66 (95% CI: 0.51\u20130.81) for Gleason 5\u20137 cases and 1.07 (95% CI: 0.87\u20131.3) for Gleason 8\u201310 cases. Conclusion: Prostate cancer specific survival in PLCO was comparable across arms and significantly better than expected based on nationwide population data. How much of the better survival is due to a healthy volunteer effect and to lead-time and overdiagnosis biases is not readily determinable.",

The long-term objective was to reduce the incidence in colorectal cancer (CRC) by detection and removal of advanced adenomas. Currently, the effect of colonoscopy screening on the population-based incidence of CRC in Germany is unknown. Methods: We provide data on stage-specific (age-standardized) incidence rates in three federal states in Germany, 6 years after the implementation of colonoscopy. Results: Between 2002 and 2008 a statistically significant decrease in CRC incidence could be observed (annually 3.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: \u22123.8; \u22122.2). The decline could be observed in all advanced tumor categories (T2, T3, and T4), whereas the incidence of in situ carcinomas (Tis) increased annually by 51.6% (95% CI: 28.0; 79.4) until 2004, and remained stable until 2008.

Aim of our study was to find out whether statin users in Finland have an increased incidence of MCC.A cohort of 224\u00a0715 male and 230\u00a0220 female statin users during 1994\u20132007 was identified from the Prescription Register of the National Social Insurance Institution. This cohort was followed up through the Finnish Cancer Registry for MCC up to 2009.There were altogether 50 cases of MCCs, while the expected number of cases, calculated on the basis of the MCC incidence in comparable Finnish population, was 39.9 (SIR 1.25, 95% CI 0.93\u20131.65). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) for MCC in ages <60 years was 3.16 (95% CI 0.65\u20139.23), in ages 60\u201374 years 1.94 (95% CI 1.23\u20132.90) and in ages \u226575 years 0.89 (95% CI 0.57\u20131.31). The relative risk of MCC decreased significantly, 0.79 fold (95% CI 0.67\u20130.92), at each 5 year step when moving towards older age groups. There was no significant variation in SIR related to years since starting the statin use, or between the genders.MCC is the first neuroendocrine cancer linked to statin use.

In view of the rising incidence of cancer in sub-Saharan Africa, urgent steps are needed to guide appropriate policy, health sector investment and resource allocation. We posit that hospital based cancer registries (HBCR) are fundamental sources of information on the frequent cancer sites in limited resource regions where population level data is often unavailable. In regions where population based cancer registries are not in existence, HBCR are beneficial for policy and planning. Materials and methods: Nineteen of twenty-one cancer registries in Nigeria met the definition of HBCR, and from these registries, we requested data on cancer cases recorded from January 2009 to December 2010. 16 of the 19 registries (84%) responded. Data on year hospital was established; year cancer registry was established, no. of pathologists and types of oncology services available in each tertiary health facility were shown. Analysis of relative frequency of cancers in each HBCR, the basis of diagnosis recorded in the HBCR and the total number of cases recorded by gender was carried out. Results: The total number of cancers registered in these 11 hospital based cancer registries in 2009 and 2010 was 6484. The number of new cancer cases recorded annually in these hospital based cancer registries on average was 117 cases in males and I77 cases in females. Breast and cervical cancer were the most common cancers seen in women while prostate cancer was the commonest among men seen in these tertiary hospitals. Conclusion: Information provided by HBCR is beneficial and can be utilized for the improvement of cancer care delivery systems in low and middle income countries where there are no population based cancer registries.",

Few studies have examined the association of genetic variants in sex hormone-related genes with endometrial cancer risk. Methods: We conducted a case-control study nested within three cohorts to examine the association of endometrial cancer risk with polymorphisms in hormone-related genes among 391 cases (92% postmenopausal at diagnosis) and 712 individually-matched controls. We also examined the association of these polymorphisms with circulating levels of sex hormones and SHBG in a cross-sectional analysis including 596 healthy postmenopausal women at blood donation (controls from this nested case-control study and from a nested case-control study of breast cancer in one of the three cohorts). Results: Adjusting for endometrial cancer risk factors, the A allele of rs4775936 in CYP19 was significantly associated (ORper allele\u00a0=\u00a01.22, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u20131.47, ptrend\u00a0=\u00a00.04), while the T allele of rs10046 was marginally associated with increased risk of endometrial cancer (ORper allele\u00a0=\u00a01.20, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.99\u20131.45, ptrend\u00a0=\u00a00.06).

     "abstract": "Objective: The invitation to population screening is based on age criteria in many countries. Screening is not offered to younger or older participants, because the benefits in these age groups do not outweigh the harms. One could argue that it is not so much age that determines the benefits but the risk of developing preclinical and treatable cancer. Cancer risk varies with age but is also affected by other factors. Methods: We performed a systematic review for risk models for the three types of cancer for which population screening programs exist: breast, cervical and colon cancer. We used an evaluation scheme that distinguishes three phases of model development: model derivation, validation and impact analysis. Data were collected in August 2010. Results: We identified two colorectal, four breast and three cervix cancer risk models. One colorectal, four breast and none of the cervix cancer models have been externally validated. We could not identify evaluations of the impact on population screening effectiveness. Conclusion: We conclude that risk models for the pre-selection of screening have been developed. These models could improve the pre-selection for screening, help in making personal decisions about participation, and reduce adverse effects of population screening. The validity of this hypothesis, as well as practicalities and issues of equity and reliability, have to be tested in further studies.",

PET-CT images were interpreted by visual inspection and semi-quantitative analysis (standardized uptake value, SUV). Histopathological and formal clinical follow-up findings were used to assess the value of FDG PET-CT. Results: FDG PET-CT was able to detect the primary tumor in 54/120 patients (42.5%). The primary tumors were confirmed by histopathologic and formal clinical follow-up findings, and located in the head and neck (n\u00a0=\u00a017), the lung (n\u00a0=\u00a019), the breast (n\u00a0=\u00a02), the esophagus (n\u00a0=\u00a01), the stomach (n\u00a0=\u00a02), the bile ducts (n\u00a0=\u00a01), the pancreas (n\u00a0=\u00a03), the co1on (n\u00a0=\u00a03), the ovary (n\u00a0=\u00a02), the prostate (n\u00a0=\u00a0l), others (n\u00a0=\u00a03).

Conclusion: 18F-FDG PET-CT whole body imaging is both a noninvasive and a very sensitive tomographic whole-body imaging modality, allowing for the detection of a primary tumor and complete tumor staging in single examination, which can contribute substantially to selecting appropriate therapeutic methods and evaluating prognosis. Perhaps 18F-FDG PET-CT whole body imaging should be used as a first-line imaging modality for patients with carcinoma of unknown primary rather than using it after other diagnostic procedures have failed to identify a primary tumor.",

     "abstract": "Aim: To determine current rates of childhood cancer mortality at a national level for Australia and to evaluate recent trends. Methods: Using population-based data from the Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry, we calculated cancer-related mortality counts and rates for the 3-year period 2006\u20132008 and trends between 1998 and 2008 by sex, age group, and cause of death (defined according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancers, third edition). Rates were directly age-standardised to the 2000 World Standard Population, and linear regression was used to determine the magnitude and significance of trends. The standardised mortality ratio for non-cancer deaths among children with cancer was also estimated. Results: A total of 282 children (23 per million per year) died from cancer in Australia between 2006 and 2008. Large decreases were observed in cancer mortality rates over the study period, particularly for boys (\u22125.5% per year; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), children aged 10\u201314 years old (\u22125.5% per year; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and leukaemia patients (\u22129.4% per year; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Children with cancer were twice as likely to die from non-cancer causes compared to other children (SMR\u00a0=\u00a02.06; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Conclusions: While ongoing improvements in childhood cancer mortality in Australia are generally encouraging, of concern is the lack of a corresponding decrease in mortality among children with certain types of tumours of the central nervous system during the past decade. The results also highlight the need for intensive monitoring of childhood cancer patients for other serious diseases that may subsequently arise.",

In this study, we investigated the role of RBM5 in the cisplatin resistance observed in human lung non-small cell lung cancer cells and evaluated the effect of RBM5 modulation on cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by cisplatin in the parental non-small cell lung cancer cells A549 and their cisplatin resistant counterparts, A549/DDP cells. Methods: RBM5 mRNA and protein expression in the A549 and A549/DDP cells was analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot. The A549/DDP cells were then transfected with a pcDNA3-RBM5 plasmid, and an RBM5-specific siRNA was transfected into A549 cells, prior to treatment with cisplatin. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analyses were performed to confirm the expression of RBM5 mRNA or protein, and knockdown of RBM5 mRNA or protein, respectively. MTT assays were used to evaluate chemosensitivity to cisplatin. Apoptosis was assessed by DAPI nuclear staining and flow cytometric analysis with an Annexin-V-FITC apoptosis kit. Cytosolic cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-9 were detected by western blot. Results: The expression of RBM5 mRNA and protein was significantly reduced in the A549/DDP cells compared with the A549 cells. Exogenous expression of RBM5 by the pcDNA3-RBM5 resensitized the response of A549/DDP to cisplatin, resulting in a significant increase in tumor-suppressing activity induced by cisplatin. In contrast, downregulation of RBM5 with siRNA in the A549 cells inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis. We also found that the RBM5-enhanced chemosensitivity was associated with the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, activation of caspase-9 and the downstream marker caspase-3. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that RBM5 may serve as a biomarker with the ability to predict a response to cisplatin. It may also act as a prognostic indicator in lung cancer patients. Our findings suggest that there may be clinical utility for ectopic RBM5 such as enhancing and resensitizing nonresponders to cisplatin.",

     "abstract": "A majority of patients with ovarian carcinoma who receive conventional treatment of surgical staging and platinum-based chemotherapy recur and ultimately succumb to their diseases. Novel therapies that target specific pathways involved in ovarian tumorigenesis are rapidly emerging. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in 30\u201398% of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC), and the signaling cascades activated are related with cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and angiogenesis, as well as resistance to cell apoptosis. Various trials are ongoing focusing on EGFR as an attractive target in treatment of EOC. Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), cetuximab and panitumumab, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), erlotinib and gefitinib, are the most advanced in clinical development. The available data suggests that MAbs and TKIs only show marginal activity when they are used alone, but combination with platinum-based chemotherapy can induce elevated overall response rate in recurrent EOC patients. Consequently, mechanisms for intrinsic and extrinsic resistance have been explored due to the poor clinical response to EGFR-targeted therapy. Careful consideration of these clinical studies and the possible mechanisms involved in resistance can provide evidence for improvements in subsequent research. Identification of responder profiles and development of rational regimen of combination therapy of EGFR-targeted therapy with other effective treatment modalities may eventually bring about substantial progress in the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancers.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: Cancer has become a major source of morbidity and mortality globally. Despite the threat that cancer poses to public health in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), few countries in this region have data on cancer incidence. In this paper, we present estimates of cancer incidence in Nigeria based on data from 2 population-based cancer registries (PBCR) that are part of the Nigerian national cancer registry program. Materials and methods: We analyzed data from 2 population based cancer registries in Nigeria, the Ibadan Population Based Cancer Registry (IBCR) and the Abuja Population Based Cancer Registry (ABCR) covering a 2 year period 2009\u20132010. Data are reported by registry, gender and in age groups. We present data on the age specific incidence rates of all invasive cancers and report age standardized rates of the most common cancers stratified by gender in both registries. Results: The age standardized incidence rate for all invasive cancers from the IBCR was 66.4 per 100\u00a0000 men and 130.6 per 100\u00a0000 women. In ABCR it was 58.3 per 100\u00a0000 for men and 138.6 per 100\u00a0000 for women. A total of 3393 cancer cases were reported by the IBCR. Of these cases, 34% (1155) were seen among males and 66% (2238) in females. In Abuja over the same period, 1128 invasive cancers were reported. 33.6% (389) of these cases were in males and 66.4% (768) in females. Mean age of diagnosis of all cancers in men for Ibadan and Abuja were 51.1 and 49.9 years respectively. For women, mean age of diagnosis of all cancers in Ibadan and Abuja were 49.1 and 45.4 respectively. Breast and cervical cancer were the commonest cancers among women and prostate cancer the most common among men. Breast cancer age standardized incidence rate (ASR) at the IBCR was 52.0 per 100\u00a0000 in IBCR and 64.6 per 100\u00a0000 in ABCR. Cervical cancer ASR at the IBCR was 36.0 per 100\u00a0000 and 30.3 per 100\u00a0000 at the ABCR. The observed differences in incidence rates of breast, cervical and prostate cancer between Ibadan and Abuja, were not statistically significant. Conclusion: Cancer incidence data from two population based cancer registries in Nigeria suggests substantial increase in incidence of breast cancer in recent times. This paper highlights the need for high quality regional cancer registries in Nigeria and other SSA countries.",

Education-specific incidence and mortality rate ratios were estimated by means of multivariate Poisson regression models.We found both the positive and inverse educational gradients in cancer incidence and mortality. The risk of developing cancer (all sites) was lower among men and women with the lowest education, whereas cancer mortality was higher among lower educated men. The higher educational level was also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer among men and an increased risk of breast cancer among women. However, prostate cancer mortality was the highest in the lowest education group, whereas breast cancer mortality among women did not show any statistically significant differences. Lower educated men had significantly higher incidence and mortality due to lung and stomach cancers. Strikingly high incidence and mortality due to cervix cancer was observed among women with secondary and lower than secondary education.The results point to inequalities in early diagnosis and survival from cancer and failures ensuring equal access to medical care. Further more in-depth studies are needed in order to understand the nature and determinants of these inequalities.",

The samples were analyzed with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by reverse hybridization for the identification of HPV types.HPV was identified in 95/96 ICC specimens (98.9%), in 142/149 CIN3 (95.3%) and in 78/84 CIN2 samples (92.8%). The most common types for ICC and CIN3 were: HPV16, 18, 31, and 33, and for CIN2 were HPV16, 31, 51, 52, and 18. HPV single infection was found in 82.1% of ICC cases, in 79.4% of CIN2 cases, and in 77.4% of CIN3 cases. HPV16 was identified as a single infection more frequently in women with CIN3+ than in those with CIN2 (68.6% versus 46.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and HPV16 or HPV18 types were more prevalent in CIN3+ than in CIN2 (73.4% versus 50%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0006).this is the first study of the distribution of HPV types in ICC, CIN2, and CIN3 conducted throughout the territory of Venezuela. HPV16 and HPV18 were the most frequent HPV types identified in single and multiple infections in both ICC and CIN3 groups, and are associated with severity of lesion.

     "abstract": "Introduction: A personal history of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is associated with increased risk of other malignancies, but the reason is unknown. The hedgehog pathway is critical to the etiology of BCC, and is also believed to contribute to susceptibility to other cancers. This study tested the hypothesis that hedgehog pathway and pathway-related gene variants contribute to the increased risk of subsequent cancers among those with a history of BCC. Methods: The study was nested within the ongoing CLUE II cohort study, established in 1989 in Washington County, Maryland, USA. The study consisted of a cancer-free control group (n\u00a0=\u00a02296) compared to three different groups of cancer cases ascertained through 2007, those diagnosed with: (1) Other (non-BCC) cancer only (n\u00a0=\u00a02349); (2) BCC only (n\u00a0=\u00a0534); and (3) BCC plus other cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0446). The frequencies of variant alleles were compared among these four groups for 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 6 hedgehog pathway genes (SHH, IHH, PTCH2, SMO, GLI1, SUFU), and also 22 SNPs in VDR and 8 SNPs in FAS, which have cross-talk with the hedgehog pathway. Results: Comparing those with both BCC and other cancer versus those with no cancer, no significant associations were observed for any of the hedgehog pathway SNPs, or for the FAS SNPs. One VDR SNP was nominally significantly associated with the BCC cancer-prone phenotype, rs11574085 [per minor allele odds ratio (OR) 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05\u20131.82; p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.02]. Conclusion: The hedgehog pathway gene SNPs studied, along with the VDR and FAS SNPs studied, are not strongly associated with the BCC cancer-prone phenotype.",

     "abstract": "Aim: Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and its cell surface receptor, NGALR, have been implicated in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of various human malignant neoplasms. In particularly, it has been demonstrated that NGAL is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and closely associated with the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of NGAL and NGALR in HCC. Methods: Expression of NGAL and NGALR was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissues from 138 patients who underwent curative resection of HCC. The association of NGAL or NGALR expression with the clinicopathologic features was analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the prognostic value of NGAL and/or NGALR expression for HCC patients. Results: The expression levels of NGAL and NGALR were both up-regulated in HCC tissues, and to be associated with vascular invasion (both P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), TNM stage (both P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and tumor recurrence (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A positive correlation between expression of the two markers was also observed (r\u00a0=\u00a00.89; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Additionally, survival analysis showed that high expression of NGAL or NGALR was significantly associated with poor prognosis for patients with HCC (both P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Patients with high expression of both NGAL and NGALR had a shorter overall survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than those with low expression of both. Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed both NGAL and NGALR were independent predictors of overall survival. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate for the first time that the up-regulations of NGAL and NGALR expression in HCC were both significantly correlated with unfavorable clinicopathologic features and independent poor prognostic factor for overall survival in patients. These findings suggest that NGAL and NGALR expression might be served as novel prognostic factors and potential therapeutic targets in HCC.",

     "abstract": "Background and aims: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common cause of death by cancer worldwide. In Morocco, HCC is characterized by few mutations and a mild chromosome instability suggesting that epigenetic changes may represent the driving force of tumorigenesis in the region. Recently, three studies looked for an association between EP300 or PCAF polymorphisms and cancer but there is a conspicuous lack of data regarding these histone acetyltransferase (HAT) variants and HCC development. The aim of the current study was to assess the impact of the Ile997Val in EP300 and Asn386Ser in PCAF polymorphisms on the risk of HCC. Materials and methods: We performed a case\u2013control study comparing 94 cases with HCC and 220 matching controls. Sequencing methods were used to determine the genotype at the Ile997Val and Asn386Ser on EP300 and PCAF. Results: We found an overall association between genotypes Val/Val in EP300 and HCC risk (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.08\u20138.47; P\u00a0=\u00a00.028). Population stratifications revealed a trend or significantly higher risks of HCC development for women and HCV-negative patients carrying the EP300 Val/Val genotype (OR, 4.06; 95% CI, 0.71\u201323.36; P\u00a0=\u00a00.09 and OR, 4.48; 95% CI, 1.04\u201319.14; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02, respectively). The PCAF Ser/Ser genotype at codon 386 was more frequent in HCC cases than in control group (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). We observed trends for higher risk of HCC among men and/or HCV-negative patients carrying Ser/Ser genotype when compared with controls (OR, 10.62; 95% CI, 0.50\u2013225.13 and OR, 11.78; 95% CI, 0.47\u2013295.56, respectively). Conclusion: It appears that variants of the transcriptional coactivator genes (EP300 and PCAF) may influence HCC risk in populations with low mutations or chromosomal instability rates.

The total amount and the metabolism of endogenous estrogens, e.g., the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) and 16\u03b1-OHE1 may influence breast cancer risk. This study examined the association of urinary estrogen metabolites with breast density in premenopausal women. Methods: Urine samples were collected at baseline and after 2 years, analyzed for 11 estrogen metabolites plus progesterone and testosterone by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry, and adjusted for creatinine levels. Mixed-effects regression was applied to examine the association of estrogens with breast density. Results: Total estrogen metabolites (181\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0113 vs. 247\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0165\u00a0pmol/mg creatinine, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and the 2/16\u03b1-OH ratio (8.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.4 vs. 13.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) were lower in the 74 Asian than in the 114 non-Asian women. In adjusted models, positive associations of total estrogen metabolites (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and the 2/16\u03b1-OHE1 ratio (p\u00a0=\u00a00.08) with percent density were detected in Asians only.

Results for the size of the dense area weakly reflected the findings for percent density, while associations with the non-dense area were in the opposite direction. Conclusions: The findings that the 2-OH pathway is associated with higher and the 16\u03b1-OH pathway with lower breast density contradicts the hypothesized risk profile of these metabolites, but, if a relation between estrogen metabolites and breast cancer risk exists, it may be mediated through pathways other than mammographic density.",

     "abstract": "Background: To date, there is no screening programme for colorectal cancer (CRC) in Flanders, Belgium. However, The European Code Against Cancer (2003) recommends a population-based approach for CRC screening. This study aimed to obtain information about potential participation rates for a population-based screening programme for CRC in Flanders, and to compare two invitation strategies. Methods: In 2009, a trial programme for CRC screening was set up in three Flemish areas for all average-risk people aged 50\u201374 years, using an immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) with a cut-off value set at 75\u00a0ng/ml of haemoglobin. The faecal sampling set was sent at random by post (mail group) or provided by the general practitioner (GP group). Results: In total, 19,542 people were invited to participate. Of these, 8229 provided a faecal sample, resulting in an overall participation rate of 42.1%. Participation by mail and through the GP was 52.3% (95% CI, 51.3\u201353.2) and 27.7% (95% CI, 26.7\u201328.6), respectively. The difference of 24.6% was statistically significant (95% CI, 23.3\u201325.9, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Before the reminder letter was sent and the other invitation strategy was offered, the overall participation rate was 26.5% (n\u00a0=\u00a05176); 36.4% (95% CI, 35.5\u201337.4) for the mail group and 16.6% (95% CI, 15.8\u201317.3) for the GP group. The odds of participating in CRC screening was almost three times higher for people invited by mail as opposed to people invited through a GP (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.96, 95% CI, 2.78\u20133.14, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Women were more likely to participate in CRC screening than men (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.22, 95% CI, 1.15\u20131.30, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In addition, we found that inhabitants from residential (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.98, 95% CI, 1.85\u20132.11) and rural (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.90, 95% CI, 2.66\u20133.16) areas were more likely to participate than those in urban areas. Of the 8229 people who submitted a faecal sample, 435 (5.3%) had a positive iFOBT, and of those, CRC was diagnosed in 18 (5.7%) individuals. Compliance for follow-up colonoscopy was 72.9%, and did not differ between the mail (72.4%, 95% CI, 67.5\u201377.3) and GP groups (74.3, 95% CI, 66.2\u201382.5).

Methods: Representative survey data of the non-institutionalized United States population were used from the 2000, 2005, and 2008 National Health Interview Survey. Analyses targeted persons 50\u201385 years of age without a personal history of cancer and with complete information on all study variables (n\u00a0=\u00a021,760). Multivariate logistic regression was used to model marital status differences in the probability of undergoing a colorectal endoscopy exam with interaction effects used to model variation over time by gender, health insurance, and poverty level. Results: Married persons were more likely than unmarried persons to report ever having undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam (odds ratio [OR], 1.21; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12\u20131.29), and the difference between married and unmarried persons in the probability of undergoing a colorectal endoscopy exam remained stable over time. Married persons were more likely than unmarried persons to report having undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam within the past 10 years (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.15\u20131.95). For each survey year, married men were significantly more likely than women and unmarried men to report having undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam. For example, in 2008, 56% of married men reported having undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam, compared to 49% of unmarried men, 52% of married women, and 50% of unmarried women. Among persons with health insurance, married persons were significantly more likely than unmarried persons to have undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam. Among persons who were poor, there was no difference by marital status in the likelihood of having undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam. However, among persons who were not poor, married persons were more likely than unmarried persons to have undergone a colorectal endoscopy exam. Conclusion: Given that colorectal endoscopy exams are a potentially life-saving procedure, persistently higher uptake of colorectal endoscopy for married persons over time may be an important health promoting benefit of marriage. Therefore, clinicians and policy makers should focus on improving the use of cancer prevention services among unmarried persons.",

Inequalities in male UADT cancer mortality remained stable over time (RII1990\u20131998\u00a0=\u00a00.21 (95% confidence interval 0.15\u20130.29); RII1999\u20132007\u00a0=\u00a00.17 (0.11\u20130.26)) whereas inequalities in lung cancer mortality increased among the younger men (RII1990\u20131998\u00a0=\u00a00.48 (0.28\u20130.83); RII1999\u20132007\u00a0=\u00a00.16 (0.09\u20130.31)). Among women, inequalities in lung cancer mortality became apparent during the second period with higher mortality among those with less education. This trend was exclusively driven by the younger women, among whom inequalities reached about the same magnitude as among younger men (RII1999\u20132007\u00a0=\u00a00.21 (0.08\u20130.56)). Conclusion: UADT cancer mortality rates strongly decreased over time for every educational level. This implies that the burden of health associated with socioeconomic inequalities in UADT cancer mortality decreased substantially. Inequalities in lung cancer mortality are increasing among the younger generation and are expected to increase even more. Differences in magnitude of inequalities among men and women may disappear in the coming decades.",

     "abstract": "Background: Few cohort studies have examined smoking and alcohol consumption in relation to risk of thyroid cancer, and their findings are conflicting. Methods: We therefore assessed the association of smoking and alcohol intake with risk of thyroid cancer in a cohort of 159,340 women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative. Over 12.7 years of follow-up 331 cases of thyroid cancer, of which 276 were papillary thyroid cancer, were identified. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Compared to never smokers, ever smokers did not have altered risk. Current smokers had reduced risk for all thyroid cancer (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.29\u20131.00) and for papillary thyroid cancer (HR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15\u20130.78); however, the number of current smokers among cases was small. No associations or trends were seen for amount smoked, age of starting smoking, or age at quitting. Smokers of \u226540\u00a0pack-years had a significantly reduced risk of papillary thyroid cancer (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21\u20130.89). In contrast, women who had smoked for\u00a0<\u00a020 years had increased risk of thyroid cancer (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05\u20131.74) and papillary cancer (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.09\u20131.89). Alcohol intake was not associated with risk. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that current smoking and having higher pack-years of exposure are associated with a modestly reduced risk of thyroid cancer, whereas alcohol consumption does not appear to affect risk.",

     "abstract": "Background: Prostate cancer (PC) is the most frequently diagnosed solid tumor in U.S. men. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 40 risk-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including variants in androgen pathway genes (e.g., KLK3 and AR). Androgens are important in PC and genes involved in this pathway are therefore candidates for conferring susceptibility to PC. Methods: In this hypothesis-testing study, we evaluated PC risk in association with SNPs in 22 candidate genes involved in androgen metabolism or interactions with the androgen receptor (AR). A total of 187 SNPs were genotyped in 1458 cases and 1351 age-matched controls from a population-based study. PC risk was estimated using adjusted unconditional logistic regression and multinomial regression models. Results: Single SNP analyses showed evidence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for associations with 14 SNPs in 9 genes: NKX3.1, HSD17B3, AKR1C3, SULT2A1, CYP17A1, KLK3, JAK2, NCOA4 and STAT3. The most significant result was observed for rs2253502 in HSD17B3 (odds ratio, OR\u00a0=\u00a00.57, 95% CI: 0.39\u20130.84). In addition, five SNPs in four genes (CYP17A1, HSD17B4, NCOA4, and SULT2A1) were associated with more aggressive disease (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Conclusions: Our results replicate previously reported associations for SNPs in CYP17A1, HSD17B3, ARK1C3, NKX3.1, NCOA4 and KLK3. In addition, novel associations were observed for SNPs in JAK2, HSD17B4, and SULT2A1. These results will require replication in larger studies.",

     "abstract": "Our previous studies have led to a novel hypothesis that tumor metastasis is triggered by aberrant lymphocyte infiltration that disrupts intercellular junctions and surface adhesion molecules and causes dissociation of tumor cells from the primary tumor core, allowing lymphocytes to conjoin with dissociated tumor cells and physically \u2018drag\u2019 them to different tissue sites. Our hypothesis is supported by morphological and immunohistochemical data from multiple types of human cancer. This hypothesis challenges the traditional belief that the physical conjunction between tumor cells and lymphocytes would lead to degeneration of the tumor cells. To validate our hypothesis, H&E and immunostained sections were examined under high magnification to identify potential signs of degeneration-related changes. Our study revealed that >60% of isolated tumor cells overlying focal capsule disruptions, or within the stroma and vascular structures, were physically conjoined with lymphocytes to form tumor cell-lymphocyte chimeras (TLCs). Approximately 90% of the tumor cell partners of TLCs were morphologically indistinguishable from their counterparts within the tumor core. In addition, one third of the tumor cells of TLCs expressed high levels of cell proliferation specific proteins, or were undergoing mitosis. Our study also revealed that a subset of dilated lymphatic ducts or blood vessels at the site of focal capsule disruptions harbored variable numbers of tumor cells, and the wall of these structures was in direct physical continuity with the myoepithelial cell layer. Our study suggests that the onset of tumor metastasis may occur in two forms: (1) lymphocyte-mediated shuttling that allows lymphocytes to physically \u2018drag\u2019 tumor cells to different sites, and (2) tumor progenitor-mediated angiogenesis that allows tumor cells to directly enter the vascular structures.",

Methods: Analyses are based on a subset of the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study population. Eligible households included those with children less than 8 years old who lived in the same residence since diagnosis (reference date for controls). The reliability was based on two repeated in-person interviews. Kappa, percent positive and negative agreements were used to assess reliability of responses to ever/never use of six pesticides categories. Results: Kappa statistics ranged from 0.31 to 0.61 (fair to substantial agreement), with 9 out of the 12 tests indicating moderate agreement. The percent positive agreement ranged from 46 to 80% and the percent negative agreement from 54 to 95%. Reliability for all pesticide types as assessed by the three reliability measures did not differ significantly for cases and controls as confirmed by bootstrap analysis. For most pesticide types, Kappa and percent positive agreement were higher for non-Hispanics than Hispanics and for households with higher income vs. lower income. Conclusions: Reproducibility of maternal-reported pesticide use was moderate to high and was similar among cases and controls suggesting that differential recall is not likely to be a major source of bias.",

Danish health registries are an important resource for monitoring side effects of drugs. The International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD-10), currently used in Denmark, does not have a specific code for ONJ, making it difficult to monitor its occurrence. Objectives: To estimate the positive predictive value (PPV) for ONJ of currently used ICD-10 codes, suggested by Danish oral and maxillofacial surgeons, in order to assess feasibility of identification of ONJ cases among cancer patients in the Danish National Registry of Patients (DNRP). Methods: This study was conducted in northern Denmark (1.8 million inhabitants) among patients with a history of cancer. In Denmark ONJ cases are referred to hospital-based departments of oral and maxillofacial surgery (DOMS). In the DNRP, we identified patients with potential ONJ diagnosed at DOMS (as suggested by a series of ICD-10 codes) from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2009. To confirm or rule out ONJ, we reviewed hospital records of these patients originating from DOMS. A confirmed ONJ case was defined by the presence of exposed maxillofacial bone for 8 weeks or more, in the absence of previous craniofacial radiation therapy. The PPV was the proportion of confirmed cases among all potential cases. Results: Among 85,910 eligible cancer patients, we identified 91 (0.11%) potential cases of ONJ, of which 18 were confirmed. The overall PPV was 20% (95% CI: 12\u201329%), ranging from 0% to50% for individual ICD-10 codes. Conclusions: A majority of cases identified by the suggested ICD-10 codes did not fulfill the criteria for ONJ, even though the potential cases were identified at DOMS. Therefore, reliance on ICD-10 codes, without hospital chart review, will lead to an overestimation of the occurrence of ONJ among cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "Objective: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide, and over 85% of cervical cancers occur in developing countries such as China. Lack of resources for nationwide cervical cancer screening in China makes vaccination against oncogenic strains of HPV particularly important. Knowledge of age at sexual debut and sexual behavior is essential prior to implementation of a national vaccination program. Methods and materials: A cross-sectional epidemiologic survey was conducted across 21 urban and rural sites in China to assess age at sexual debut and sexual behavior. 98.6% of the 11,852 recruited women aged 15\u201359 years were included in the analysis. Data were collected using a short, nurse-administered questionnaire and analyzed using standard descriptive statistics and survival analysis. Results: In urban areas, more than ten percent of the 15\u201319 year old age group were already sexually active at the time of interview; this number increased to nearly 44% in the 20\u201324 year old age group. Chinese young women with an occupation were more likely to be sexually active compared to female students of the same age, irrespective of area of residence. The crude median sexual debut age for the youngest age group was 17 years, earlier than the sexual debut age reported by older cohorts. Younger age cohorts had an earlier menarche age than older cohorts and were more likely to have more sexual partners than older women, and more likely to have partners with more than one female partner. Conclusion: There is a trend towards earlier sexual debut and riskier sexual behaviors in younger age groups of Chinese women. These findings suggest that HPV vaccination of women between the ages of 13 and 15 years, before the completion of national compulsory education, is likely to contribute to the prevention of HPV infection and cervical cancer in China.",

Methods: A total of 64,554 participants (aged 55\u201374) completed baseline questionnaires and underwent FSG at baseline. Of these, 39,385 participants returned for repeat screening. We used logistic regression models to assess factors that are associated with inadequate FSG (defined as a study in which the depth of insertion of FSG was <50\u00a0cm or visual inspection was limited to <90% of the mucosal surface but without detection of a polyp or mass). Results: Of 7084 (11%) participants with inadequate FSG at baseline, 6496 (91.7%) had <50\u00a0cm depth of insertion (75.3% due to patient discomfort) and 500 (7.1%) participants had adequate depth of insertion but suboptimal bowel preparation.

Research examining body mass index (BMI) and CRC screening has had mixed results. A clearer understanding of the extent to which high-BMI subgroups are screened for CRC is needed to inform planning for CRC screening promotions targeting BMI. Methods: Data were obtained from a random, population-based sample of women and men at average-risk for CRC (aged 50\u201375 years) during 2004 (n\u00a0=\u00a01098). Multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate whether BMI category was significantly associated with the probability of reporting recent CRC screening and with the probability of agreeing with statements denoting attitudes/perceptions about CRC and screening. Attitudes/perceptions about CRC and screening were evaluated as potential mediators and moderators of the association between BMI category and CRC screening. Results: After controlling for characteristics associated with CRC screening, overweight and obese women were each 40% less likely to have CRC screening than women with normal-BMI (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.6, 95% CI:0.4\u20130.9 and OR\u00a0=\u00a00.6, 95% CI:0.3\u20130.9). BMI category was unrelated to screening among men. Obese women (but not men) were less aware than normal-BMI women that obesity increased risk for CRC (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.5, 95% CI:0.3\u20130.9) and less worried about CRC (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.5, 95% CI:0.3\u20130.8). However, findings suggest that attitudes/perceptions about CRC and screening did not mediate or moderate the association between BMI category and CRC screening. Conclusion: Overweight/obese women are at increased risk for CRC because of their greater BMI and their propensity not to screen for CRC. Study findings suggest that potentially modifiable perceptions, e.g., lack of awareness of risk for CRC and less worry about CRC, in this subgroup may not explain the relationship between BMI category and reduced screening.",

Age-standardised incidence rates (per 100,000 European standard population, (ASR(E))) were calculated for each of the six groups by year of diagnosis and by socioeconomic deprivation. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Results: The largest group was pancreatic cancers (63%), followed by primary liver (14%) and biliary cancers (13%). ASR(E) were highest for pancreatic and primary liver cancers whereas cancers of the gallbladder, duodenum and ampulla of Vater had a very low incidence. Over time the incidence of all six groups remained relatively stable, although primary liver cancer increased slightly in males. Incidence rates were higher in males than in females in all groups except gallbladder cancer, and all six groups had a higher incidence in the more deprived quintiles. Overall survival was poor in each of the HPB cancer groups. Conclusions: HPB tumours are uncommon and are associated with poor long term survival reflecting the late stage at presentation. Incidence patterns suggest variable rates linked to socioeconomic deprivation and highlight a male predominance in all sites except the gallbladder. Identification of high risk populations should be emphasised in initiatives to raise awareness and facilitate earlier diagnosis.",

     "abstract": "Background: Increasing trends in the incidence of breast cancer have been observed in India, including Mumbai. These have likely stemmed from an increasing adoption of lifestyle factors more akin to those commonly observed in westernized countries. Analyses of breast cancer trends and corresponding estimation of the future burden are necessary to better plan rationale cancer control programmes within the country. Methods: We used data from the population-based Mumbai Cancer Registry to study time trends in breast cancer incidence rates 1976\u20132005 and stratified them according to younger (25\u201349) and older age group (50\u201374). Age-period-cohort models were fitted and the net drift used as a measure of the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC). Age-period-cohort models and population projections were used to predict the age-adjusted rates and number of breast cancer cases circa 2025. Results: Breast cancer incidence increased significantly among older women over three decades (EAPC\u00a0=\u00a01.6%; 95% CI 1.1\u20132.0), while lesser but significant 1% increase in incidence among younger women was observed (EAPC\u00a0=\u00a01.0; 95% CI 0.2\u20131.8). Non-linear period and cohort effects were observed; a trends-based model predicted a close-to-doubling of incident cases by 2025 from 1300 mean cases per annum in 2001\u20132005 to over 2500 cases in 2021\u20132025. Conclusions: The incidence of breast cancer has increased in Mumbai during last two to three decades, with increases greater among older women. The number of breast cancer cases is predicted to double to over 2500 cases, the vast majority affecting older women.",

     "abstract": "Lymphoma is the third most common pediatric malignancy. The purpose of this study was to analyze the incidence rates of lymphoma in children and adolescents in Brazil.All cases of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) were extracted from 14 population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) from 2000 to 2005, and included children and adolescents 0\u201319 years old. Analyses included age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIRs) and age-specific incidence rates (ASIRs) by each PBCR. A social exclusion index (SEI) was built and used as proxy for socioeconomic status (SES) levels. Correlations between SES and incidence rates were investigated using Spearman's test.The median incidence of lymphoma was 22.7/million. AAIRs of lymphomas varied from 12.9 (Salvador) to 34.5 per million (S\u00e3o Paulo). Median AAIR was 8.8/million, 9.8/million, and 2.9/million for NHL, HL, and BL, respectively. In all PBCRs except that of Recife, AAIR was slightly higher in males than females. The median ASIR was highest for HL (18.5/million) at 15\u201319 years for both genders. For NHL there were two peaks for ASIR: 11.1/million (1\u20134 years of age) and 13.2/million (15\u201319 years of age). The median ASIR for BL was highest among children aged 1\u20134 years (4.7/million) and in males. Higher SEI correlated with higher incidence of HL (P\u00a0=\u00a00.06), whereas rates of NHL and BL did not correlate with SEI. Borderline different incidence rates were observed in HL correlated with cities with higher SEIs.Incidence rates of lymphomas in Brazil do not differ compared to rates reported worldwide, although SES differences deserve further investigation.",

     "abstract": "Background: Leukaemia is a heterogeneous disease in which haematopoietic progenitor cells acquire genetic lesions that lead to a block in differentiation, increased self-renewal, and unregulated proliferation. The enzyme 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), involved in folate metabolism, plays a crucial role in cells because folate availability is important for DNA integrity. The aim of this case\u2013control study was to evaluate the association of the C677T MTHFR gene polymorphism with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Materials and methods: A total of 275 leukaemia cases \u2013 including AML (n\u00a0=\u00a0112), ALL (n\u00a0=\u00a081), CML (n\u00a0=\u00a043), CLL (n\u00a0=\u00a039) \u2013 and 251 age/sex-matched healthy control individuals participated in this study. MTHFR C677T polymorphisms in the cases and controls were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Results: The average MTHFR 677CC, 677CT, 677TT genotype frequencies of total leukaemia cases were 68.73%, 19.64%, and 11.64% in cases, and 71.71%, 24.30%, and 3.98% in healthy controls, respectively. The average frequency of the MTHFR 677T allele was 21.45% among the cases compared to 16.13% among the controls. Conclusions: In the present case\u2013control study we have observed a higher frequency of the MTHFR 677TT genotype in cases of leukaemia (AML, ALL, CML and CLL) as compared with controls; this might be due to ethnic and geographic variation. As per our findings, although the frequency of the MTHFR 677T allele is moderately high in AML, ALL and CLL, no statistically significant association was found; on the other hand statistically significant association was found in the context of CML cases.",

Design: Ecological study. Setting: Scotland and the West Midlands. Data: We extracted anonymised colorectal cancer (ICD-10 C18\u2013C20) registration (1982\u20132006) and death records (1982\u20132007), along with corresponding mid-year population estimates. Intervention: Residents of the screening pilot areas, in the age group 50\u201369 years, were offered biennial guaiac faecal occult blood test screening from 2000 onwards. Screening was not offered routinely in non-pilot areas until the start of the roll-out of the national screening programmes in England and in Scotland in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Main outcome measures: We analysed trends in age-specific incidence and mortality rates, and Dukes\u2019 stage distribution. Within each country/region, we compared the screening pilot areas to non-screening pilot (\u2018control\u2019) areas using Chi square tests and Poisson regression modelling. Results: Following the start of the screening pilots, as expected in the prevalent round of a new screening programme, in the pilot areas there was a short-lived increase in incidence of colorectal cancer among 50\u201369 year olds except for females in the West Midlands. A trend towards earlier stage and less advanced disease was also observed, with males showing significant increases in Dukes\u2019 A and corresponding decreases in Dukes\u2019 C in the screening pilot areas (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.03). With the exception of females in the West Midlands, mortality rates for colorectal cancer decreased significantly and at a faster rate in the populations invited for screening. Conclusion: The existence of a natural control population not yet invited for screening provided a unique opportunity to assess whether the benefits of colorectal cancer screening, beyond the setting of a randomised controlled trial, could be detected using routinely collected statistics. Our analysis suggests that screening will fulfil its aim of reducing mortality from colorectal cancer.",

     "abstract": "Objective: There are substantial ethnic inequalities in stage at diagnosis and cervical cancer survival in New Zealand. We assessed what proportions of these differences were due to screening history (for the analyses of late stage diagnosis), stage at diagnosis (for the analyses of survival), comorbid conditions (for the analyses of survival), and travel time to the nearest General Practitioner and cancer centre. Methods: The study involved 1594 cervical cancer cases registered during 1994\u20132005. We used G-computation to assess the validity of the estimates obtained by standard logistic regression methods. Results: M\u0101ori women had a higher risk of late stage diagnosis compared with \u2018Other\u2019 (mainly European) women (odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a02.71; 95% confidence interval 1.98, 3.72); this decreased only slightly (OR 2.39; 1.72, 3.30) after adjustment for screening history, and travel time to the nearest General Practitioner and cancer centre. In contrast, the (non-significantly) elevated risk in Pacific women (1.39; 0.76, 2.54) disappeared almost completely when adjusted for the same factors (1.06; 0.57, 1.96). The hazard ratio of mortality for cervical cancer for M\u0101ori women was 2.10 (1.61, 2.73) and decreased to 1.45 (1.10, 1.92) after adjustment for stage at diagnosis, comorbid conditions, and travel time to the nearest General Practitioner and cancer centre; the corresponding estimates for Pacific women were 1.96 (1.23, 3.13) and 1.55 (0.93, 2.57). The G-computation analyses gave similar findings. Conclusions: The excess relative risk of late stage diagnosis in M\u0101ori women remains largely unexplained, while more than half of the excess relative risk of mortality in M\u0101ori and Pacific women is explained by differences in stage at diagnosis and comorbid conditions.",

As part of a larger study, this paper reports on our analyses of physician beliefs about fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) and strategies they employed to enhance patient adherence. The second aim of this paper is to report on the perceptions of individuals at average risk for colorectal cancer (CRC) in regard to their awareness of the FOBT and their responses to physician recommendations about FOBT screening.The larger study was conducted in urban and rural Manitoba, Canada between 2008 and 2010. We used a qualitative design and conducted semi-structured, audio-recorded interviews with 15 physicians and 27 individuals at average risk for CRC. We included data from 11 family members or friends on their perspectives of FOBT instructions as individuals who were also at average risk for CRC and had their own experiences with CRC screening recommendations.Despite widespread knowledge of The Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care CRC screening guidelines, physician attitudes, behaviors, and instructions were not uniform in promoting patient adherence to FOBT screening. Individuals at average-risk for CRC identified that FOBT instructions were confusing and burdensome, which in turn served as a barrier in their adherence to FOBT screening.Variation in FOBT instruction counseling in relation to the recommended age of individuals at average risk for CRC, as well as adequate patient preparation affected patient adherence. We recommend uniform or standardized instructions and counseling by health care providers who administer the FOBT kit to patients to promote adherence to recommended CRC screening.",

     "abstract": "Background: Few attempts to present a comprehensive scoring instrument for sun exposure and protection have been made. The present paper aims to describe a possible set of questions suitable for such an instrument, comprising the most important aspects of sun exposure and protection. Methods: The material from a previously performed intervention study, using a questionnaire based on Likert scales and on the Transtheoretical Model of Behaviour Change (TTM), was utilised. 213 primary healthcare patients filled in the questionnaire and were randomised into two groups receiving sun protection advice, in Group 1 in letter-form, and in Group 2 orally during a doctor's consultation. In the original study, increased sun protection/readiness to increase sun protection was demonstrated for several items in Group 2, at six months. To compose a comprehensive scoring instrument, five questions concerning sun exposure/protection (intentional tanning, sunscreen use, choice of SPF, number of occasions with sunburn, and time spent in the sun at midday), were selected to give a 20 point behavioural score. Similarly, four TTM-based questions (giving up sunbathing, using clothes for sun protection, using sunscreens, and staying in the shade) gave a 16 point \u201cpropensity-to-change\u201d-score. Results: At follow-up, increased sun protection reflected in the behavioural score occurred only in Group 2 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). For the propensity-to-change-score, increased readiness to increase sun protection occurred in both groups, but the change was significantly higher in Group 2 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Categorisation of the 20 point behavioural score, into three risk levels, revealed a significantly higher shift of subjects moving to a lower risk level in Group 2 compared to Group 1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Conclusions: In conclusion, twinning of a summarised Likert scale behavioural score with a TTM-based propensity-to-change-score seems promising for the creation of a questionnaire-based, comprehensive scoring instrument for sun exposure and protection.",

Incidence rates were much higher in more developed countries compared to less developed countries (71.7/100,000 and 29.3/100,000 respectively, adjusted to the World 2000 Standard Population) whereas the corresponding mortality rates were 17.1/100,000 and 11.8/100,000. Five-year relative survival estimates range from 12% in parts of Africa to almost 90% in the United States, Australia and Canada, with the differential linked to a combination of early detection, access to treatment services and cultural barriers. Observed improvements in breast cancer survival in more developed parts of the world over recent decades have been attributed to the introduction of population-based screening using mammography and the systemic use of adjuvant therapies.The future worldwide breast cancer burden will be strongly influenced by large predicted rises in incidence throughout parts of Asia due to an increasingly \u201cwesternised\u201d lifestyle.

Even though breast cancer incidence is lower in Arab developing countries than in western countries, Arabic women are more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier age than the women in western countries. Method: A descriptive study was undertaken to investigate the type of breast cancer, lymph node involvement, side of breast and, region and age distribution of breast cancer patients registered in the National Oncology Centre in Yemen. Results: From September 2004 to December 2010, 2654 women across Yemen diagnosed with breast cancer were registered in the National Oncology Centre for treatment. Between the years 2004 and 2010, breast cancer represented 22% of all cancers registered in women. Seventy-one per cent of the women were aged 50 or younger at the time of diagnosis. The most common age group affected was women aged 41\u201350 years, with (35%) of cases occurring in this age. Invasive ductal carcinoma was the most common pathology (76%) and 79% of the patients had lymph node involvement at the time of diagnosis. Approximately 2% had bilateral disease and the frequency of left (44%) and right breast cancer (42%) were similar. Conclusion: This study has shown that breast cancer is a disease of young women in Yemen. The majority of women presented with lymph node involvement. Hence efforts are needed to increase breast cancer awareness in Yemen for early detection at all age groups, and to target women living in areas that have lower access to health care services.",

Our objective here is to assess the gender-specific CRC spatio-temporal pattern in the health areas of Navarre, a Spanish province, during the period 1990\u20132005. Methods: For each gender, a model with spatio-temporal CAR (Conditional Autoregressive) distributions is used for smoothing the incidence risks. Smoothing is carried out in two dimensions: space and time, allowing for a different time evolution in each health area. An estimated incidence trend curve for each health area and the corresponding confidence bands are obtained. To analyze the evolution of the geographical patterns of CRC incidence risks, maps are also provided. Results: In both genders, CRC shows an increasing trend in most of the areas. In the second half of the period 1998\u20132005 most of the areas have risks above one although not all statistically significant. In general females present equal or lower risks than males in all areas during the studied period. Conclusions: Colorectal cancer incidence risk is still increasing in the health areas of Navarre. Promoting healthful lifestyles for primary prevention and early detection programs could help to reverse the trend in the province.",

Although cervical cancer incidence and mortality is higher in HIV-positive women, resource limitations restrict the implementation of systematic screening programs in these women. We explored the potential for targeted screening by assessing the prevalence, severity and predictors of cervical squamous intra-epithelial lesions (SILs) in HIV-positive women in Cameroon. Methods and findings: We conducted a cross-sectional study of women on antiretroviral therapy in Cameroon. Socio-demographic, behavioral, and clinical information was obtained from eligible women. Cervical exfoliated cells were then collected, a conventional cytology performed and epithelial lesions classified according to the Bethesda 2001 system. A total of 282 women, aged 19\u201368 years, were enrolled in this study. The median CD4 count was 179 cells/microliter (interquartile range: 100\u2013271). SILs were detected in 43.5% of the 276 women with satisfactory samples: including atypical squamous cells of unknown significance (ASCUS) 0.7%, low-grade SIL (LSIL) 25.0%, atypical squamous cells, cannot exclude high grade lesions (ASC-H) 14.5%, and high-grade SIL (HSIL) 3.3%. None of the demographic or clinical characteristics considered significantly predicted the presence of any SILs or the presence of severe lesions requiring colposcopy. Conclusion: The prevalence of SIL in women on antiretroviral therapy in Cameroon was high underscoring the need for screening and care in this population. In the absence of any accurate demographic or clinical predictor of SIL, targeted screening does not seem feasible. Alternative affordable screening options need to be explored.",

Study design and setting: Analysis of cross-sectional data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) involved 5115 men and 7100 women aged 50 years and older. Measures: Health status indicators included: self-reported perceived health status, number of chronic conditions, and functional limitation due to a chronic condition. Individuals were considered adherent to CRCS guidelines if they reported having a home-based fecal occult blood test in the past year or endoscopy in the past 10 years. Women were adherent to breast cancer screening guidelines if they reported having a mammogram in the previous 2 years. Statistical analyses were conducted using SUDAAN software to account for the complex sampling of the NHIS survey. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between each of the health status indicators and screening adherence for CRCS and mammography and to calculate estimated screening rates. Results: The three health status indicators were independently and differentially associated with screening adherence. Poor perceived health was associated with lower mammography among women, whereas a greater number of chronic conditions were consistently associated with greater screening. In adjusted analyses, functional limitation was only significantly associated with greater CRCS among women. Conclusions: Our analyses included three common indicators of health status and provide new evidence of their complex associations with cancer screening. Future studies must examine the mechanisms by which these indicators influence screening recommendations and adherence among older adults over time.",

Methods: To further investigate how and to what extent these SNPs contribute to glioma susceptibility in a Chinese population, we analyzed 43 SNPs of 226 glioma patients and 254 normal people in order to evaluate the associations between SNPs and the risk of glioma. Results: Overall, we found three protective alleles for glioma in patients: the allele \u201cG\u201d of rs1801275 in the IL4R gene by allele model (odds ratio [OR], 0.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.50\u20130.99; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and dominant model (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46\u20130.99; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) analysis respectively, the allele \u201cT\u201d of rs17748 in the TREH gene by recessive model (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23\u20131.01; P\u00a0=\u00a00.05) analysis, and the allele \u201cG\u201d of rs6470745 in CCDC26 gene by recessive model (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26\u20130.89; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) analysis. Conclusion: This study provides evidence for three glioma susceptibility genes \u2013 TREH, IL4R and CCDC26 \u2013 in a Chinese population; this may shed light on molecular markers of glioma susceptibility and could therefore be used as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for glioma patients in clinical study.",

     "abstract": "Background: ARID1A gene encodes BAF250a which is a member of the ARID family of DNA-binding proteins and a subunit of human SWI/SNF-related complexes. Low expression of ARID1A has been correlated with specific tumor cell lines or specific pathological types of cancer tissue. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of ARID1A in invasive ductal breast carcinomas and to evaluate its clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic value. Methods: ARID1A mRNA expression was evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 40 pairs of fresh frozen breast cancer and normal breast samples. BAF250a expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 112 paraffin-embedded surgical specimens of invasive breast cancers and 20 cases of matched normal breast tissues. We further analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics of ARID1A expression. Overall survival time was assessed by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and Cox regression model. Results: ARID1A mRNA expression was lower in breast cancer tissue than in corresponding normal tissue (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and this decreased expression level was markedly associated with factors such as larger tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.038), higher stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016), ER(\u2212) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.038), higher Ki-67 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025), P53 mutation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and ER(\u2212)/PR(\u2212)/Her-2(\u2212) molecular subtype (P\u00a0=\u00a00.044). With immunohistochemical staining, we showed that low BAF250a expression existed in 56% (63/112) of the breast cancers tissues. Low BAF250a expression was significantly associated with tumor stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021), P53 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018), Ki-67 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.031) and ER(\u2212)/PR(\u2212)/Her-2(\u2212) molecular subtype (P\u00a0=\u00a00.044). Low ARID1A expression was a predictor, not an independent, of overall survival. Conclusion: These data suggest that low ARID1A expression is frequent in breast cancers, and we need to investigate further the role of ARID1A and SWI/SNF complexes in breast tumorigenesis, especially in triple-negative breast cancer.",

Despite several studies of the relation between family history and B-cell disorders and WM, family history of non-hematologic cancers has not been systematically investigated. We thus examined associations of family history of breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancers with WM.All probands aged 20\u201379 years with bone marrow biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of WM between May 1, 1999 and January 1, 2010 at the Bing Center for Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. We reviewed medical records for eligible probands to determine family history of cancer (defined as a cancer diagnosis for \u22651 first-degree relative(s) of the proband). Using expected values constructed from the United States National Health Interview Survey, we estimated age- and race-standardized rate ratios (RRs) for family history of breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancers by WM subtype.Family history of prostate cancer had the largest overall rate ratio (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.4, 95% confidence limits [CL]: 1.1, 1.7), and among sporadic cases, family history of prostate and breast cancer had the largest rate ratios (prostate: RR\u00a0=\u00a01.3, 95% CL: 1.1, 1.7; breast: RR\u00a0=\u00a01.3, 95% CL: 1.2, 1.6).Our study suggests that it may be worthwhile to pursue these associations in a case\u2013control study with uniform selection and data collection for cases and controls, and at least some record-based information on family history.",

Setting: Victoria, Australia. Participants: 234 women resident in Victoria aged 18\u201328 years in May 2009. Main outcome measures: Self-reported HPV vaccination uptake, reasons for non-receipt or failure to complete vaccination, knowledge and attitudes about HPV vaccination and Pap screening, and cervical screening intentions. Results: The response rate for eligible households was 62.4%. Half of the women (56%, n\u00a0=\u00a0131) had previously had a Pap test and 74% (age standardised estimate) had received HPV vaccine. Of the vaccinated women, 5% had received one dose only, 18% two doses and 76% had completed the course (1.7% unsure of number of doses). Vaccination uptake was highest in the youngest women (declining from 90% for at least one dose in women aged 18\u201338.5% in women aged 28; p for trend <0.001). Among women who had heard of the vaccine, 96% knew Pap tests were still needed after it, although 20% thought the vaccine could prevent all cervical cancers and 9% thought the vaccine could treat cervical abnormalities and cancer. Among vaccinated women, 8% of women agreed that having been vaccinated made them less likely to have Pap tests in the future. Conclusions: Self-reported coverage in this sample was higher than that recorded on the national vaccination register. Young women report the message that Pap tests are required after vaccination, but there are gaps in their knowledge about the limitations of the vaccine so it remains to be seen if they actually follow through with having Pap tests. Ongoing monitoring of cervical screening rates will be important as this cohort ages.",

However, no analyses have examined how delivery rate modifies the strength of odds ratio (OR) trends with total exposure, i.e., the impact on the OR for a fixed total exposure of high exposure rate for short duration compared with low exposure rate for long duration. Methods: The authors pooled data from 12 case\u2013control studies from the Barrett's Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON), including 1242 (EAC), 1263 (EGJA) and 954 (ESCC) cases and 7053 controls, modeled joint ORs for cumulative exposure and exposure rate for cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption, and evaluated effect modification by sex, body mass index (BMI), age and self-reported acid reflux. Results: For smoking, all sites exhibited inverse delivery rate effects, whereby ORs with pack-years increased, but trends weakened with increasing cigarettes/day. None of the examined factors modified associations, except for ESCC where younger ages at diagnosis enhanced smoking effects (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). For EAC and EGJA, ORs with drink-years exhibited inverse associations in <5\u00a0drinks/day consumers and no association in heavier consumers. For ESCC, ORs with drink-years increased, with trends strengthening with greater drinks/day. There was no significant effect modification, except for EAC and EGJA where acid reflux mitigated the inverse associations (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). For ESCC, younger ages at diagnosis enhanced drinking-related ORs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

We performed this meta-analysis to estimate the association between p53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and endometrial cancer. Methods: An electronic search of PubMed was conducted to select studies. Studies containing available genotype frequencies of Arg72Pro were chosen, and the association was assessed by pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Nine published studies, including 829 endometrial cancer cases and 1387 controls, were identified. The overall results suggested that the variant genotypes were not associated with the endometrial cancer risk in all genetic models (additive model: OR 1.027, 95% CI 0.893\u20131.18, P\u00a0=\u00a00.71; recessive model: OR 1.099, 95% CI 0.802\u20131.507, P\u00a0=\u00a00.556; dominant model: OR 1.013, 95% CI 0.842\u20131.219 P\u00a0=\u00a00.89).

Sex-specific and age-standardised incidence rates of these tumours were calculated by their anatomical location and histological type in different time periods. Figures were plotted to show the proportions and incidence rates over time, and joinpoint loglinear regression models were estimated to assess any time trends.A total of 6604 patients with malignant small bowel tumours were identified. The age-standardised incidence of all malignant small bowel tumours increased from 14.2 to 19.7 per 1,000,000 person-years during the study period. The incidence of duodenal cancer increased more than 3-fold (from 1.6 to 5.4 per 1,000,000 person-years), which was mainly expained by a dramatical rising trend of adenocarcinoma of the duodenum (from 0.7 to 4.2 per 1,000,000 person-years). Malignant tumours of small bowel with unspecified anatomical locations showed a slight increase (from 7.0 to 7.9 per 1,000,000).

We investigated the clinical and prognostic importance of whole blood breast cancer early onset gene 1 (BRCA1) DNA methylation in sporadic breast cancer. Methods Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood cells (PBCs) of 902 breast cancer patients at diagnosis, with no BRCA1 mutation, and 990 control women. DNA methylation was measured by quantitative analysis of methylated alleles (QAMA) to estimate the extent of methylation of 2 CpG sites in the promoter region of BRCA1 oncosuppressor. Results BRCA1 promoter methylation rate in PBCs was 47.1% with a 95% confidence interval [46.1; 48.1] in breast cancer patients, and 45.9% with a 95% confidence interval [45.0; 46.8] in controls. We found a trend toward BRCA1 promoter hypermethylation in PBCs of sporadic breast cancer patients compared with controls. Association between methylation and clinicopathological features was evaluated using statistical tests. BRCA1 promoter methylation in PBCs increased significantly in breast cancer patients compared with controls, for age over 70 years (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022), in post-menopausal status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013), for a body mass index (BMI) <20 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0095) or a waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) \u226476.8 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0027). We also found an association of increased BRCA1 promoter methylation in PBCs with ACA/ACA genotype for the SNP Thr594Thr in ESR (estrogen receptor gene), known to be associated with breast cancer risk (p\u00a0=\u00a00.092), reflecting the reduced presence of this genotype in this breast cancer case-control study.

The adjusted analyses showed race, age, alcohol consumption, current Chlamydia trachomatis (chlamydia) and Trichamonas vaginalis (trichomoniasis), bacterial vaginosis (BV), number of lifetime male sex partners predicted positive index-HPV antibody test results. However, only the number of male sex partners predicted positivity for HPV6/11- and 16/18-DNA, and chlamydia infection predicted positivity for HPV6/11-DNA alone. Conclusions: Taken together, type-specific HPV-DNA and -antibody evidence of HPV6/11/16/18 infections among behaviorally low-risk 16\u201323 year old females is high. Since almost all participants would have benefited by either currently available bivalent or quadrivalent vaccine strategies, delaying vaccination beyond menarche may be a missed opportunity to fully protect young females against HPV6/11/16/18 infections and related dysplasias. Early diagnosis and treatment of chlamydia and trichomonas may be important in HPV pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Background: Although the number of Canadians being screened for colon cancer is rising, only 40% of Canadians aged 50 years or older reported they had engaged in faecal occult blood test (FOBT) screening as recommended. The notion of \u2018partnerships\u2019 that is inclusive of physicians, individuals at average-risk for colorectal cancer, and influential family members is receiving more attention in primary health care literature and policy on promoting health maintenance behaviours. To the best of our knowledge there are no studies that have taken a tripartite approach in describing perspectives of these three key stakeholders on the role of family in promoting adherence to FOBT. The aim of this study was to address the gap in understanding the perspectives of primary care physicians, individuals at average-risk for colorectal cancer, and family on family role in promoting adherence to FOBT screening. Method: We employed a qualitative design and conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 physicians, 27 patients at average-risk for colorectal cancer, and 19 family members or friends from urban and rural Manitoba, Canada between October 2008 and March 2010. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using content analysis and constant comparative techniques. Results: While physicians described a clear role for family in managing chronic disease or dealing with acute or serious illness, they identified barriers in working with family to promote FOBT screening: lack of time, privacy and confidentiality concerns, and family dynamics. Conversely, patients and family described instrumental, emotional, informational, and appraisal roles that family play in promoting FOBT outside medical encounters. Conclusion: Adherence to colorectal cancer screening is based on supportive \u2018patient\u2013physician\u2019 dialogue that is separate from assistive \u2018patient\u2013family member\u2019 relations. Further research is required to explore social support mechanisms involving family members outside medical encounters that hold promise in boosting self-efficacy, overcoming barriers, and gaining positive reinforcement for individuals at average-risk when making the decision to engage in FOBT.",

     "abstract": "Background: Esophageal cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignant tumors in China. The aim of this study was to provide the representative and comprehensive informations about the long-term mortality trends of this disease in China between 1987 and 2009, using joinpoint regression and generalized additive models (GAMs). Methods: Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMR), overall and truncated (35\u201364 years), were calculated using the direct calculation method, and joinpoint regression was performed to obtain the estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC). GAMs were fitted to study the effects of age, period and birth cohort on mortality trends. Results: ASMR exhibited an overall remarked decline for rural females (EAPC\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.3 95%CI: \u22123.3, \u22121.2), urban males (EAPC\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.8 95%CI: \u22122.6, \u22121.0) and urban females (EAPC\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.7 95%CI: \u22124.9, \u22122.4), but a small drop observed was not statistically significant for rural males (EAPC\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.9 95%CI: \u22122.0, 0.3). The declines in ASMR were more noticeable for urban residents in recent years. Among all the residents, age effect showed an progressively increasing trend, whereas cohort effect declined steadily after the year corresponding to the maximum risk value. Period effect seemed to remain substantially unchanged throughout the years. Conclusions: Although variations in mortality rates were observed according to sex and area, the overall decreasing trends in esophageal cancer mortality were found in most Chinese people, aside from rural males. The findings could correspond to the changes in age- and cohort-related factors in the population. Further study is required to understand these potential factors.",

We carried out a meta-analysis of published case\u2013control studies to derive a more precise estimation of the association. Relevant studies were identified from PubMed, EMBASE, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure up to February 1st, 2011. Crude odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to investigate the strength of the association. Data were available from a total of 33 case\u2013control studies with 8534 cases and 11,737 controls. The combined results based on all studies showed that there was a statistically significant link between CCND1 G870A polymorphism and DTC risk (GG vs. AA: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.83, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.71\u20130.96). In the analysis of ethnic groups, we found the A allele carriers had a significantly increased DTC susceptibility among Caucasians, but not among Asians. When stratified for tumor location, the results based on all studies only showed the variant allele 870A might have a significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), especially of rectal cancer (GG vs. AA: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.71, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.58\u20130.89). When stratifying by the stage and histological differentiation of CRC, we only observed that patients had a significantly higher frequency of CCND1 870 AA than non-cancer patients among Caucasians. The A allele carriers (hetero- or homozygotes) were significantly more common in cases with a family history of CRC than in controls. There was no evidence of publication bias for CCND1 G870A polymorphism with DTC risk. In summary, this meta-analysis demonstrates that the CCND1 G870A polymorphism may be an ethnicity-dependent risk factor for DTC. And this genetic variant may increase the risk of rectal cancer, but not colon cancer.",

Methods: Incidence data from a cancer registry, national incidence estimations for France, mortality data, and hospital medico-administrative data were used to estimate the three prevalence indices. The methods included a modelling of epidemiological data and a specific process of data extraction from medico-administrative databases. Results: Limited-duration prevalence at 33 years was a proxy for complete prevalence only in patients aged less than 70 years. In 2007 and in women older than 15 years, the limited-duration prevalence at 33 years rate per 100,000 women was estimated at 2372 for D\u00e9partement Is\u00e8re and 2354 for whole France. The latter rate corresponded to 613,000 women. The highest rate corresponded to women aged 65\u201374 years (6161 per 100,000 in whole France). About one third of the 33-year limited-duration prevalence cases were diagnosed five years before and about one fourth were hospitalized for breast-cancer-related care (i.e., hospital prevalence). In 2007, the rate of hospitalized women was 557 per 100,000 in whole France. Among the 120,310 women hospitalized for breast-cancer-related care in 2007, about 13% were diagnosed before 2004. Conclusion: Limited-duration prevalence (long- and short-term), and hospital prevalence are complementary indices of cancer prevalence. Their efficient direct or indirect estimations are essential to reflect the burden of the disease and forecast median- and long-term medical, economic, and social patient needs, especially after the initial treatment.",

     "abstract": "Background: Information on prostate cancer testing and incidence among men under age 50 is scant. This study aims to describe trends of prostate cancer testing and incidence by demographic and clinical characteristics and identify potential correlations between prostate cancer testing and incidence. Methods: We examined prostate cancer testing and incidence rates among American men under age of 50 using data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2002, 2004, 2006, and 2008) and data from the National Program of Cancer Registries and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results programs (2001\u20132006). We conducted descriptive, logistic regression, and trend analyses using SUDAAN and SEER*Stat. Results: The prostate cancer incidence rate among black men was more than 2-fold that of white men. The overall prostate cancer incidence rate slightly increased from 2001 to 2006; however, the prevalence of prostate cancer testing declined over time. There was a borderline significant increase in prostate cancer incidence rate (APC\u00a0=\u00a03.5, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.0, 7.0) for men aged 40\u201344.

Conclusions: We observed a large difference in prostate cancer incidence between blacks and whites under age 50. Similar patterns in prostate cancer testing and cancer incidence by race and ethnicity suggested prostate cancer testing might have influenced incidence to some extent in this young population. The different temporal patterns for prostate cancer testing and incidence, especially for men aged 40\u201344 years, suggested screening alone could not fully accounted for the increasing prostate cancer incidence rates.

Setting: Population-based cancer registry in the area of Osaka Prefecture. Participants: All 66,032 cases diagnosed with a stomach cancer in Osaka Prefecture, Japan between 1975 and 2000 and registered in the Osaka Cancer Registry. Main outcome measures: \u2018Cure\u2019 fraction and median survival time for \u2018uncured\u2019 patients were estimated with multivariable mixture \u2018cure\u2019 model. The role played by age and stage at diagnosis on the changes in \u2018cure\u2019 parameters between 1975 and 2000 was evaluated. Missing stage was handled by multiple imputation approach. Results: More than 50% of the patients diagnosed with a stomach cancer in 1996\u20132000 were estimated \u2018cured\u2019 from their cancer, corresponding to a 20% increase since 1975\u20131980. Median survival time for \u2018uncured\u2019 patients however remained unchanged at about 8 months. \u2018Cure\u2019 fraction was over 85% for localised tumours and 30% for regional tumours, but stayed as low as 2.5% for distant metastatic cancers. Improvement was underestimated by about 10% because of ageing of cancer patients. Changes in stage distribution explained up to 40% of the increase in \u2018cure\u2019 fraction among men and up to 13% in women. Overdiagnosis was unlikely to play any role in these patterns. Conclusions: \u2018Cure\u2019 fraction from stomach cancer dramatically increased in Osaka, Japan since 1975, partly because of earlier stage at diagnosis, but mostly due to improvement in treatment of stomach cancer patients. This study, based on a leading country in term of stomach cancer management, provides insightful results for other countries in which \u2018cure\u2019 fraction is usually much lower.",

     "abstract": "Background: Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are classified as neoplasms of uncertain or unknown behavior in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) Version 10 and can contribute to risk of death from complications (especially thrombosis). Methods: U.S age-standardized death rates using ICD-Version 10 codes relevant to classical MPN (i.e., polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and \u201cchronic myeloproliferative disease\u201d) were examined for 1999\u20132006. The underlying cause of death and also all causes (\u201cmultiple causes\u201d or \u201cmentions\u201d) coded on death certificates were considered. Trends were assessed by using percentage change (PC) in rate between 1999 and 2006, and annual percentage change (APC) estimated from linear regression. Results: The decline in death rates was large for MPN, whether based only the underlying cause (PC\u00a0=\u00a0\u221219.7%, APC\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.4%) or on the substantially higher rates based on any cause (PC\u00a0=\u00a0\u221224.1%, APC\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.8%), and was consistent by gender and age group (<65 and 65+ years). For deaths with MPN coded as other than the underlying cause, cardiovascular diseases were the most common underlying cause and the ASR for these deaths declined substantially (PC\u00a0=\u00a0\u221240.0%). Conclusions: Use of the underlying cause of death in surveillance will considerably underestimate MPN-related mortality rates in the population. Studies are needed on treatment in random samples of MPN patients from population-based cancer registries. Continued surveillance of MPN-related mortality rates in the population is needed in view of recent attempts (including the use of aspirin) to control cardiovascular complications of MPN.",

     "abstract": "A method has been previously proposed for estimating risk-adjusted incidence rates (RAIRs) from cancer data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Unlike conventionally reported SEER-based cancer incidence rates in the United States, but similar to the approach taken by the International Association of Cancer Registries and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the method uses only the first primary cancer of the given site. In addition, it also adjusts for population-based cancer prevalence in order to obtain a better population-based measure of cancer risk. For most cancers multiple cancer primaries are rare and the prevalence of the disease is low. However, female breast cancer has a comparatively high risk of subsequent breast cancers and is the most prevalent cancer in women. Hence, in white women RAIRs are 3.0% lower in ages 30\u201339, 4.2% lower in ages 40\u201349, 4.0% lower in ages 50\u201359, 4.1% lower in ages 60\u201369, 3.8% lower in ages 70\u201379, and 4.3% lower in ages 80 years and older compared with conventional rates. Corresponding lower percentages for black women are 3.9%, 6.9%, 5.1%, 7.8%, 6.0%, and 2.2%, respectively. Age-group specific trends in breast cancer incidence rates differed between RAIRs and conventional incidence rates, increasingly so with older age. The number of cancer cases in the United States is estimated from conventional incidence rates and population estimates. In 2007, the estimated number of malignant breast cancer cases was 181,665 for white women and 20,203 for black women. The estimated number of breast cancer cases decreased by 4.8% for whites and 6.5% for blacks when based on RAIRs. RAIRs are a better measure of breast cancer risk and trends in RAIRs are better for monitoring the effect of risk factors.",

Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted among 8329 male and 15,386 female subjects between 1992 and 2000. The analysis used five definitions of metabolic syndrome. The information on the site-specific cancer was obtained from the population-based cancer registry. A Cox proportional hazard model was adapted for the statistical analyses. The average follow-up period was 9.1 years. Results The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III 2001 criteria of metabolic syndrome revealed that the hazard ratio of metabolic syndrome for liver cancer was 1.89 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11\u20133.22) for males, and 3.67 (CI 1.78\u20137.57) for females. The hazard ratio for female breast cancer was 2.87 (CI 1.67\u20134.94). When the analysis was limited to postmenopausal women (55 years of age or older), the ratio increased to 6.73 (CI 2.93\u201315.43). The NCEP-ATPIII 2001 criteria were superior to the other four proposed criteria for predicting the incidence of cancer. In the statistical model, which included all components of the metabolic syndrome and the metabolic syndrome (present or absent), high blood glucose was a significant associated factor for all sites and liver cancers, whereas the metabolic syndrome was found to be a significant associated factor for breast cancer. Conclusion Metabolic syndrome may play an important role in the incidence of breast cancer. High fasting plasma glucose level is considered to be useful as an associated factor for the incidence of all-sites and liver cancer.",

     "publication date": "04-2012",
     "abstract": "Background: Relative survival is an extensively used method in population based cancer studies as it provides a measure of survival without the need for accurate cause of death information. It gives an estimate for the probability of dying from cancer in the absence of other causes by estimating the excess mortality in the study population when compared to an external group. The external group is usually the general population within a country or state and mortality estimates are taken from national life tables that are broken down by age, sex, calendar year and, where applicable, race/ethnicity. One potential bias when using relative survival that is most often overlooked occurs when there are a high proportion of deaths due to a specific cancer in the external group. Methods: This paper uses data from the Finnish Cancer Registry to illustrate, through the use of a simple sensitivity analysis, the impact that specific cancer deaths in the population mortality figures can have on the estimate of relative survival. Results: We found that when examining specific diseases such as breast cancer and colon cancer, the proportion of deaths due to these specific cancers in the general population is so small in comparison to the total mortality that they make little difference to the relative survival estimates. However, prostate cancer proved to be an exception to this. For all cancer sites combined the sensitivity analysis illustrates a major limitation for this type of analysis, particularly with the older age groups. Conclusion: We recommend that, with a classification of diseases as wide as all cancer sites, relative survival should not be used without appropriate adjustment.",

     "abstract": "Objectives: A model is proposed to estimate and compare cervical cancer screening test properties for third world populations when only subjects with a positive screen receive the gold standard test. Two fallible screening tests are compared, VIA and VILI. Methods: We extend the model of Berry et al. [1] to the multi-site case in order to pool information across sites and form better estimates for prevalences of cervical cancer, the true positive rates (TPRs), and false positive rates (FPRs). For 10 centers in five African countries and India involving more than 52,000 women, Bayesian methods were applied when gold standard results for subjects who screened negative on both tests were treated as missing. The Bayesian methods employed suitably correct for the missing screen negative subjects. The study included gold standard verification for all cases, making it possible to validate model-based estimation of accuracy using only outcomes of women with positive VIA or VILI result (ignoring verification of double negative screening test results) with the observed full data outcomes. Results: Across the sites, estimates for the sensitivity of VIA ranged from 0.792 to 0.917 while for VILI sensitivities ranged from 0.929 to 0.977. False positive estimates ranged from 0.056 to 0.256 for VIA and 0.085 to 0.269 for VILI. The pooled estimates for the TPR of VIA and VILI are 0.871 and 0.968, respectively, compared to the full data values of 0.816 and 0.918. Similarly, the pooled estimates for the FPR of VIA and VILI are 0.134 and 0.146, respectively, compared to the full data values of 0.144 and 0.146. Globally, we found VILI had a statistically significant higher sensitivity but no statistical difference for the false positive rates could be determined. Conclusion: Hierarchical Bayesian methods provide a straight forward approach to estimate screening test properties, prevalences, and to perform comparisons for screening studies where screen negative subjects do not receive the gold standard test. The hierarchical model with random effects used to analyze the sites simultaneously resulted in improved estimates compared to the single-site analyses with improved TPR estimates and nearly identical FPR estimates to the full data outcomes. Furthermore, higher TPRs but similar FPRs were observed for VILI compared to VIA.",

There was also no association between DCIS and current use of these hormones. In addition, estimated risk of DCIS did not increase with duration of use of these preparations. Conclusions: These results add to a small literature that remains inconclusive. To determine whether HT poses risk of in situ breast cancer, larger studies with greater power and precise control of important covariates (e.g., mammography screening) are needed, as are meta-analyses of available data.",

     "abstract": "Background: Risk factors for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) differ among populations and remain controversial. We carried out a hospital-based case\u2013control study to examine the effects of health status, lifestyle, and some genetic polymorphisms on ccRCC risk in Chinese subjects. Methods: Between 2007 and 2009, 250 newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed ccRCC cases and 299 sex-, age-matched healthy controls provided complete information including consumption of tea and alcohol, smoking, occupational exposure, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, diabetes, and urolithiasis by face-to-face interview in Shanghai. Genetic polymorphisms of cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase (CYP1A1: 6235T>C, 4889A>G, and 4887C>A), glutathione S-transferase (GSTP1: 342A>G), and N-acetyltransferase (NAT2: 481C>T, 590G>A, and 857G>A) were identified by PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were derived through multivariate logistic regression. Results: Green tea intake (\u2265500\u00a0ml/d) was inversely associated with ccRCC risk, with an AOR of 0.34 (95% CI 0.21\u20130.55). BMI (\u226525\u00a0kg/m2), hypertension, and urolithiasis were independently associated with an increased risk of ccRCC, with AOR (95% CI) of 2.10 (1.32\u20133.34), 2.49 (1.57\u20133.93), and 3.33 (1.12\u20139.89), respectively. No association was observed between smoking, alcohol consumption, or occupational exposure with ccRCC risk. The polymorphisms and their interactions with the environmental exposures were mostly not associated with ccRCC risk. Conclusion: BMI (\u226525\u00a0kg/m2), hypertension, and urolithiasis are independently associated with an increased risk, whereas green tea intake (\u2265500\u00a0ml/d) is independently associated with a decreased risk of ccRCC. The polymorphisms of the xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes are weakly associated with ccRCC risk in Chinese subjects.",

     "abstract": "DNA repair plays a pivotal role in maintaining genomic integrity with over 130 genes involved in various repair pathways that include base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, double strand break repair and DNA mismatch repair. Polymorphisms within genes that are involved in these processes have been widely reported to be associated with cancer susceptibility in an extensive range of malignancies that include colorectal cancer (CRC). Lynch syndrome is caused by inherited germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, predominantly in MLH1 and MSH2, that predispose to a variety of epithelial malignancies, most notably CRC. Despite being a relatively well understood hereditary cancer syndrome there remain several questions in relation to genetic influences on disease expression. Since Lynch syndrome is associated with a breakdown in DNA mismatch repair variation in other DNA repair genes may influence disease expression. In this report we have genotyped 424 Australian and Polish Lynch syndrome participants for eight common DNA repair gene polymorphisms to assess any association with the age of CRC onset. The DNA repair gene SNPs included in the study were: BRCA2 (rs11571653), MSH3 (rs26279), Lig4 (rs1805386), OGG1 (rs1052133), XRCC1 (rs25487), XRCC2 (rs3218536 and rs1799793) and XRCC3 (rs861539). Cox multi-variant regression modelling failed to provide any convincing evidence of an effect in any of the polymorphisms analysed. The data suggest that polymorphisms in DNA repair genes do not contribute to cancer risk in a population of CRC patients who are at increased risk of disease as a result in a deficiency of DNA mismatch repair.",

Methods: Breast carcinoma tissues (n\u00a0=\u00a0117) and available paired normal breast tissues (n\u00a0=\u00a065) from Tunisian women who had no family history were investigated for the methylation status of BRCA1 and BRCA2 promoters using methylation-specific PCR. Breast specimens from women without carcinoma (16 fibroadenomas and 5 mastopathies) were used as control. Results: Hypermethylation of BRCA1 and BRCA2 promoters was detected respectively in 60.7% and 69.2% of the carcinoma tissues, and in only 7.7% and 4.6% of the paired normal breast tissues. None of the fibroadenomas and mastopathies showed hypermethylation. Correlations were found between BRCA1 and BRCA2 hypermethylation and decrease in their mRNA expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.009, respectively). Moreover, BRCA1 methylation correlates with patients age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and triple negative (ER\u2212, PR\u2212, HER2\u2212) tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Patients with methylated BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 had a significant prolonged survivals compared to those with unmethylated tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

     "abstract": "Background: The aetiology of meningiomas is largely unknown although hormones have been suggested to play a role. Methods: A cohort study was performed to evaluate hormone-related factors associated with meningioma. Patients (12\u201389 years) with a first diagnosis of meningioma (January 1996\u2013June 2008) were identified from The Health Improvement Network UK primary care database and age- and sex-matched to controls (n\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0000) from the same cohort. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated following a nested case control analysis using unconditional logistic regression. Results: In total, 745 patients with meningioma were identified from a study population of 2\u00a0171\u00a0287. No significantly increased risk of meningioma was found among female users of oral contraceptives (OR: 1.15; CI: 0.67\u20131.98), hormone replacement therapy (OR: 0.99; CI: 0.73\u20131.35) or low-dose cyproterone acetate (CPA; OR: 1.51; CI: 0.33\u20136.86) compared with non-users. There was a significantly increased risk of meningioma among male users of androgen analogues (OR: 19.09; CI: 2.81\u2013129.74) and among users of high-dose CPA (OR: 6.30; CI: 1.37\u201328.94) compared with non-users, however there were only three cases currently using these drugs. No significant association was found between meningioma and prostate, breast, or genital cancers. Conclusions: Our results do not support a role for exogenous hormone use by females in meningioma development. The risk in males was only observed with high-dose, short-term (<1 year) therapy. Impact: While hormonal cancers and therapies are not associated with meningioma in females, the risk in males requires further investigation.",

We hypothesized that IGF-axis genetic variants modify individual susceptibility to pancreatic cancer. Methods: We retrospectively genotyped 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms of 10 IGF-axis genes (IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IGF2R, IGFBP1, IGFBP3, IGFBP5, IRS1, IRS2, and IRS4) in 706 pancreatic cancer patients and 706 cancer-free controls using Sequenom and TaqMan technology. The association between genotype and pancreatic cancer risk was evaluated using multivariate logistic regression. A P value \u2264.007 at a false discovery rate of 10% was set as the significance level.

The aim of the study is to investigate the relationships of apoptotic genes and apoptotic index of osteosarcoma tissue to prognosis of the patients, meanwhile to explore the valid prognostic biomarkers of osteosarcoma that will enhance efficacy of clinical treatments for osteosarcoma. Methods: In our studies, the immunohistochemical ABC and terminal DNA breakpoints in situ 3-hydroxy end labeling (TUNEL) techniques were used to detect the expressions of p53, c-MYC, BCL-2 and apoptotic index in 56 osteosarcoma specimens. The relationships between apoptotic genes expression and apoptotic index in osteosarcoma tissue and their correlations with pathologic classification and prognosis of osteosarcoma cases were analyzed. Results: We found that the expressions of p53, c-MYC, and BCL-2 were negatively correlated with apoptotic index of osteosarcoma tissue, were not correlated with pathological types of osteosarcoma, and were closely related to prognosis of the patients. Moreover, apoptotic index of osteosarcoma tissue was positively correlated with the long term survival of the patients.

     "abstract": "Background: Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men under 35 years of age, and has the highest survival for adult male malignancies. Despite the fact that survival is very high, there is evidence that survival differs between socio-economic groups. Methods: We analysed survival patterns for 1606 testicular cancer patients diagnosed during 1984\u20132001 and recruited to one of two clinical studies. The first was a surveillance study to determine relapse-free survival after orchidectomy in 865 patients with stage I nonseminomatous germ-cell testicular cancer diagnosed during 1984\u20131991 (TE04). The second study was a trial in which 1174 men with stage I seminomatous germ-cell tumours were randomised to receive radiotherapy or one injection of carboplatin between 1996 and 2001 (TE19). The number of men available for analysis from these two studies was 578 and 1028, respectively. We followed these patients up for their vital status, and assigned them an ecological measure of deprivation. Crude and relative survival were estimated at 5 and 10 years by socio-economic deprivation. Results: No significant socio-economic gradient was seen: 1.3% (95% CI \u22120.3% to 3.1%) at 5 years and 2.1% (95% CI \u22120.5% to 4.7%) at 10 years. Conclusion: We conclude that, given equal treatment at a given stage of disease, survival from testicular cancer does not depend on socio-economic status. This suggests that the socio-economic gradient in testicular cancer survival in the general population is more likely to be attributable to health care system factors than to personal or socio-economic factors in the men themselves.",

Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional survey, 1490 cancer patients who had been in contact with a hospital department during the past 12 months in three Danish counties responded to a mailed questionnaire. Factors associated with employment and return to work (i.e., working more than 0\u00a0h in the past month) respectively, were assessed in multivariate ordinal logistic regression models. Results: Of the 598 patients below age 65 who were employed at the time of diagnosis, 75% were still employed when answering the questionnaire at a median of 2.8 years after diagnosis and 63% were working. In multivariate analyses, younger and more recently diagnosed patients were more often employed. Patients diagnosed with lung or head and neck cancer were least likely to be employed and having returned to work. Advanced cancer at diagnosis was associated with loss of employment. Advanced cancer and being in active treatment were associated with not having returned to work. Conclusion: A quarter of the patients had lost their employment probably resulting in economic consequences on the individual as well as at the societal level. The highest risk was observed for older patients and those diagnosed with lung or head and neck cancer.",

This study seeks to update knowledge in this field by examining mortality from colorectal, stomach, lung, melanoma, breast and bladder cancers, as well as all cancers combined between 1981 and 2007. Methods: Data were obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Average annual age and sex-standardised mortality rates were calculated for each region of birth, period of death registration and cancer site. Results: Generally, mortality rates declined over the study period for most conditions for the majority of migrant groups. Notable exceptions included migrants from South Eastern Europe and Eastern Europe who experienced a significant increase in mortality due to all cancers combined and Australian-born individuals who recorded a significant increase in mortality due to melanoma of the skin. Migrants generally had more favourable cancer mortality outcomes, particularly for colorectal cancer and melanoma. Migrants from Southern Europe, South Eastern Europe, Chinese Asia and Southern Asia had the greatest advantage. However, migrants displayed higher rates of stomach, lung and bladder cancers than the Australian-born population. Conclusion: The migrant advantage can in part be explained by the protective effects of diet, lifestyle and reproductive behaviours. Possible explanations for why some migrants display greater mortality from stomach and bladder cancer include the consumption of abrasive, salted and preserved foods and higher rates of smoking. Greater emphasis should be placed on targeting at-risk migrant groups through screening and education programs at migrant resource centres and community groups. The study calls for further research to explain the observed trends, which has the potential to uncover important risk and protective factors.",

Endemicity of Opisthorchis viverrini (OV) \u2013 a known carcinogen \u2013 is responsible, but although infection is very common, the lifetime risk of CCA is only 5%. Other co-factors must exist, including aspects of lifestyle or diet along with variations in genetic susceptibility to them. Change in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) activity may influence both DNA methylation and synthesis. This study investigates risk factors for CCA with a focus on lifestyle, diet and MTHFR polymorphisms. Methods: Nested case\u2013control study within cohort study was conducted. 219 subjects with primary CCA were each matched with two non-cancer controls from the same cohort on sex, age at recruitment and presence/absence of OV eggs in stool. Lifestyle and dietary data were obtained at recruitment. MTHFR polymorphisms were analyzed using PCR with high resolution melting analysis. The associations were assessed using conditional logistic regression. Results: Consumption of alcohol, raw freshwater fish and beef sausage increased the risk of CCA, while fruit and/or vegetables consumption reduced risk. There were interactions between MTHFR and preserved freshwater fish and beef. These dietary items are either a source of OV or of pre-formed nitrosamine, folate and antioxidants that are of possible relevance in OV carcinogenesis. Conclusions: Primary prevention of CCA in high-risk population is based upon efforts to reduce OV infection. Reduced consumption of alcohol and preserved meats, and increased consumption of dietary folate, actions with a wider preventive potential, may also help in the reduction of CCA burden.",

Both heterozygosity (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.32, 95% CI: 1.10\u20131.58, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and homozygosity (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.16, 95% CI: 1.75\u20132.68, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for the 55M allele were associated with increased risk of breast cancer. Also there was a significant linear trend in risk associated with zero, one, and two 55M alleles (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a054.2, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).The present study showed that PON1 M and Q alleles are associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. Individuals having MM and QQ genotypes have a lower level and lower detoxification activity of the PON1 enzyme, which may increase the vulnerability of the breast to genetic damage by reducing the ability to detoxify inflammatory oxidants, as well as dietary carcinogens.",

Interleukin-23 is involved in pro-inflammatory signaling; genetic variation in the interleukin-23 receptor (IL23R) has been consistently associated with CD and UC risk. In three case\u2013control studies of colorectal adenoma (n\u00a0=\u00a0485 cases/578 controls), colon cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a01424 cases/1780 controls) and rectal cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0583 cases/775 controls), we investigated associations with 18 candidate and tagSNPs in IL23R. The three studies used an identical Illumina GoldenGate assay, allowing thorough investigation across stages and locations of colorectal neoplasia. We further explored associations with molecular cancer subtypes (MSI+, CIMP+, KRAS2mut, TP53mut). In this comprehensive study of genetic variability in IL23R across the spectrum of colorectal carcinogenesis, as well as within colon and rectal tumor molecular subtypes, we observed associations between SNPs in IL23R and risk of rectal cancer: the 88413 C\u00a0>\u00a0A (rs10889675) and 69450 C\u00a0>\u00a0A (rs7542081) polymorphisms were associated with decreased rectal cancer risk overall (p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.04 and 0.05 respectively), and specifically with rectal tumors bearing a TP53 mutation (88413 CA/AA vs. CC OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46\u201394; 69450 CA/AA vs. CC OR: 0.60; 95% CI: 0.37\u20130.98).

A multivariate regression analysis showed that a significantly increased risk of lung cancer for the 402His/His or 402His/Try carriers with OR (95% CI), 1.50 (1.12\u20132.00). When stratified by smoking status, the elevated risk of the cancer associated with variant CFH genotypes was observed among smokers, but not among non-smokers. When analyzed with cumulative smoking dose (pack-years), a super-multiplicative interaction was observed at different smoking levels. Among carriers with the 402Tyr/His or His/His genotype, the ORs of developing lung cancer for smoking\u00a0<\u00a016, 16\u201328, or >28 pack-years were 0.98 (0.49\u20131.94), 2.36 (1.14\u20134.90), and 6.39 (3.49\u201311.68), respectively.

Diet, physical activity, and stress reduction may affect tumor promotion and disease progression. Methods: A randomized trial of an intensive diet, physical activity, and meditation intervention was conducted in men with rising post-treatment PSA after definitive treatment for PrCA. Intention-to-treat methods were used to compare usual care to the intervention in 47 men with complete data. Signal detection methods were used to identify dietary factors associated with PSA change. Results: The intervention and control groups did not differ statistically on any demographic or disease-related factor. Although the intervention group experienced decreases of 39% in intakes of saturated fatty acid (SFA as percent of total calories) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and 12% in total energy intake (218\u00a0kcal/day, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05)], no difference in PSA change was observed by intervention status. Signal detection methods indicated that in men increasing their consumption of fruit, 56% experienced no rise in PSA (vs. 29% in men who did not increase their fruit intake). Among men who increased fruit and fiber intakes, PSA increased in 83% of participants who also increased saturated fatty acid intake (vs. 44% in participants who decreased or maintained saturated fatty acid intake). Conclusion: Results are discussed in the context of conventional treatment strategies that were more aggressive when this study was being conducted in the mid-2000s. Positive health changes in a number of lifestyle parameters were observed with the intervention, and both increased fruit and reduced saturated fat intakes were associated with maintaining PSA levels in men with biochemically recurrent disease.",

     "publication date": "04-2012",
     "abstract": "Introduction: Although the racial disparity in breast cancer mortality is widely discussed there are no studies that analyze this phenomenon at the city level. Methods: We used national death files, abstracting those cases for which the cause was malignant neoplasm of the breast (ICD-10\u00a0=\u00a0C50) for the numerators and American Community Survey data for the denominators. The 25 largest cities in the US were the units of analysis. Non-Hispanic Black:non-Hispanic White rate ratios (RRs) were calculated, along with their confidence intervals, as measures of the racial disparity. Seven ecological (city-level) variables were examined as possible correlates. Results: Almost all the NHB rates were greater than almost all the NHW rates. All but 3 of the RRs (range 0.78\u20132.09; median\u00a0=\u00a01.44) were >1, 13 of them significantly so. None of the RRs\u00a0<\u00a01 were significant. From among the 7 potential correlates, only median household income (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.43, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037) and a measure of segregation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.42, r\u00a0=\u00a00.039) were significantly related to the RR. Conclusion: This is the first study that we have been able to locate which examines city-level racial disparities in breast cancer mortality. The results are of concern for several cities and for the field in general. A strategy for reducing this disparity in Chicago is in place and may serve as a model for other cities wanting to initiate a similar process. Clearly it is time to take action.",

Control of cancer-causing infections and lifestyle-related carcinogens will play a significant role in prevention, but less often addressed are environmental and occupational contributions. Methods: We review environmental issues that contribute to Africa's Cancer burden. Results: We demonstrate evidence of the impact of environmental carcinogens on the cancer burden as of now and that circumstances present today may increase their contribution further. Suboptimal implementation and monitoring of environmental protection and of occupational health standards, including in the informal sector, use of outdated technologies in industry and lack of awareness of potential hazards in the specific employment structure give rise to high levels of exposures. Carcinogens of concern include (i) those that have been long present (e.g. indoor air pollution) whose contribution may increase as life-expectancy increases and long latency periods for cancer are realised, (ii) exposures in mining and agricultural sectors and (iii) modern environmental hazards, including urban air pollution and agents arising from the mis-management of hazardous waste from local, industrial and trans-boundary sources. Conclusions: Actions taken to reduce exposures and research to fill gaps in knowledge, adapted to local settings, could help mitigate the cancer burden.",

The present study is the first to analyse the testicular cancer trends in the Croatian population. Over the 25-year period, a mean number of 89 incident cases and 13 deaths were reported annually.

The incidence rates of testicular cancer incidence have been steeply increasing in successive cohorts born since the mid-1930s. The rapid rise in testicular cancer incidence in the Croatian population appears to be one of the highest rates of increase recorded in Europe and worldwide.

     "abstract": "Background: It is vital that unbiased estimates of relative survival are estimated and reported by cancer registries. A single figure of relative survival is often required to make reporting simpler. This can be obtained by pooling all ages or, more commonly, by using age-standardisation. The various methods for providing a single figure estimate of relative survival can give very different estimates. Methods: The problem is illustrated through an example using Finnish thyroid cancer data. The differences are further explored through a simulation study that investigates the effect of age on the estimates of relative survival. Results: The example highlights that in practice the all-age estimates from the various methods can be substantially different (up to 6 percentage units at 15 years of follow-up). The simulation study confirms the finding that differing estimates for the all-age estimates of relative survival are obtained. Performing age-standardisation makes the methods more comparable and results in better estimation of the true net survival. Conclusions: The all-age estimates of relative survival rarely give an appropriate estimate of net survival. We feel that modelling or stratifying by age when calculating relative survival is vitally important as the lack of homogeneity in the cohort of patients leads to potentially biased estimates. We feel that the methods using modelling provide a greater flexibility than life-table based approaches. The flexible parametric approach does not require an arbitrary splitting of the time-scale, which makes it more computationally efficient. It also has the advantage of easily being extended to incorporate time-dependent effects.",

This study's objective was to determine the impact of using multiple causes of death codes to compute site-specific cancer mortality statistics. Methods: The state cancer registries of California, Colorado and Idaho provided linked cancer registry and death certificate data for individuals who died between 2002 and 2004, had at least one cancer listed on their death certificate and were diagnosed with cancer between 1993 and 2004. These linked data were used to calculate the site-specific proportion of cancers not selected as the UCD (non-UCD) among all cancer-related deaths (any mention on the death certificate). In addition, the retrospective concordance between the death certificate and the population-based cancer registry, measured as confirmations rates, was calculated for deaths with cancer as the UCD, as a non-UCD, and for any mention. Results: Overall, non-UCD deaths comprised 9.5 percent of total deaths; 11 of the 79 cancer sites had proportions greater than 3 standard deviations from 9.5 percent. The confirmation rates for UCD and for any mention did not differ significantly for any of the cancer sites. Conclusion and impact: The site-specific variation in proportions and rates suggests that for a few cancer sites, death rates might be computed for both UCD and any mention of the cancer site on the death certificate. Nevertheless, this study provides evidence that, in general, restricting to UCD deaths will not under report cancer mortality statistics.",

Using mixed methods, we developed and validated a short instrument assessing this communication. Methods: Based on focus group interviews with 77 informants, an 8-item instrument was developed. This short instrument aimed at assessing overall aspects of the communication between cancer patients and health care staff. The items were validated first through cognitive interviews with patient\u2013observer agreement with 52 cancer patients who completed the questions and then participated in tape-recorded open-ended interviews. Observer ratings of the interviews were compared with the patients\u2019 written responses collected before interviews and kappa values were calculated.

Finally, psychometric analyses took place with data from 1490 cancer patients. Results: The weighted kappas concerning patient\u2013observer agreement ranged 0.31\u20130.88. Disagreements mainly consisted of the observer choosing the response category indicating the highest level of satisfaction whereas the patients had chosen the second highest level. Cognitive interviews showed that the questions were generally interpreted as intended. One item was excluded due to low validity.

Methods: Peer-reviewed publications on childhood leukemia and brain tumors from North America, published between 1980 and 2007, were reviewed. Incidence data by race/ethnicity were compiled from research publications, federal cancer statistics, and cancer registries. Meta-analysis was conducted to assess racial/ethnic differences by study characteristics. Racial distributions of cases from published case-control studies were compared to those of a presumably noncensored case distribution (i.e. include both participating and non-participating cases in a case-control study) or cases recorded by cancer registries. Results: In interview-based case-control studies of childhood cancer, the proportion of Whites compared to non-Whites tended to be higher among controls than among cases; however, the opposite was true for record-based case-control studies. Additionally, the proportion of Whites tended to be higher among the participating cases in the published case-control studies compared to the proportion of Whites among the non-participating cases or in cancer registries.

Non-malignant diseases such as allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects and thyroid diseases have been reported to be associated with ALL. Methods: We conducted a case-control study of family history of cancer and selected non-malignant conditions (allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, birth defects, and thyroid diseases). ALL cases were obtained from Children's Cancer Group institutions from January 1989 to June 1993. Controls were recruited via random digit dialing. Family history for first degree relatives and grandparents of ALL cases and controls was collected by structured telephone questionnaires. Conditional logistical regression was used to calculate odds ratios adjusting for potential confounders. Results: We found a borderline association of ALL and having a family member with a history of cancer in cases (n\u00a0=\u00a01842) compared to controls (n\u00a0=\u00a01986) (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.98, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.93, 1.00) and an inverse association for esophageal cancer based on small numbers. Family history of food and drug allergies demonstrated a modestly reduced risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.83, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.73, 0.95) as did family history of rheumatoid arthritis (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.79, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.65, 0.96). There were no associations with family history of any autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, birth defects, thyroid diseases and risk of childhood ALL. Conclusions: These results show no association of overall family history of cancer with childhood ALL, while providing additional evidence for an inverse association with family history of allergic disease. Two potentially new associations of ALL with family history of esophageal cancer and rheumatoid arthritis require confirmation in other studies and validation with medical records.",

     "abstract": "Background: Incidence rates of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) increased substantially in the United States and worldwide during the latter part of the 20th century, but little is known about its etiology. Obesity is associated with impaired immune function through which it may influence the risk of NHL; other factors reflecting energy homeostasis (height, abdominal adiposity, and physical activity) may also be involved. Methods: We examined the association of anthropometric factors and physical activity with risk of NHL and its major subtypes in a large cohort of women aged 50\u201379 years old who were enrolled at 40 clinical centers in the United States between 1993 and 1998. Over a mean follow-up period of 11 years, 1123 cases of NHL were identified among 158,975 women. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Height at baseline was positively associated with risk of all NHL and with that of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (HRsq4vs.q1 1.19, 95% CI 1.00\u20131.43 and 1.43, 95% CI 1.01\u20132.03, respectively). Measures of obesity and abdominal adiposity at baseline were not associated with risk. Hazard ratios for NHL were increased for women in the highest quartile of weight and body mass index at age 18 (HRsq4vs.q1 1.29, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.65 and 1.27, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.59, respectively). Some measures of recreational physical activity were modestly associated with increased risk of NHL overall, but there were no clear associations with specific subtypes. Conclusion: Our findings regarding anthropometric measures are consistent with those of several previous reports, suggesting that early life influences on growth and immune function may influence the risk of NHL later in life.",

The collected data were meta-analysed with calculation of combined relative risk and 95% confidence interval as well as studies heterogeneity. Results: A meta-analysis of 11 case\u2013control studies indicates that red meat ingestion elevates pancreatic cancer risk by 48% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.25\u20131.76).

Methods: The study included 61 PV patients and 70 cancer-free healthy controls. CYP1A1 (m1, m2, m3, m4) and GST (T1, M1) genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The risk of cancer associated with gene polymorphisms was estimated by calculations of odds ratio (ORs) and confidence intervals (95% CIs) using Mantel\u2013Haenszel statistics. Results: A statistically significant difference between the PV group and the control group was observed in the case of GSTM1 null genotype with 3.38 fold increase in risk of developing PV (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.63\u20137.01, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) while GSTT1 null genotype showed no significance (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.11; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.50\u20132.44, p\u00a0=\u00a00.38). No significant association was found between the CYP1A1 mutant genotypes (m1, m2, m4) and PV. The m3 genotype was absent in both patients and controls. Interestingly, a substantial significant increase of PV risk for the combination of GSTM1 null genotype and CYP1A1 m1 (T6235C) genotype was observed (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.38; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.15\u201316.73, p\u00a0=\u00a0.02). Furthermore, the present case\u2013control study showed that the studied Jordanian population generally resembles Caucasian populations with respect to the frequencies of CYP1A1 polymorphisms.

     "abstract": "Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common tumors worldwide. Autoantibodies to tumor-associated proteins in the serum profile, as new biomarkers, may improve the early detection of HCC. Methods: In this study, we interrogated a HCC cDNA T7 phage library for tumor-associated proteins using biopan enrichment techniques with HCC patient and normal sera. The enrichment of tumor-associated proteins after biopanning was tested using plaque assay and immunochemical detection. The putative tumor-associated phage clones were collected for PCR and sequencing analysis. Identities of those selected sequences were revealed through the sequence BLAST program. The identified phage-expressed proteins were then used to develop phage protein ELISA to measure matching autoantibodies using 70 HCC patients, 50 chronic hepatitis patients, and 70 normal serum samples. The logistic regression model and leave-one-out validation were used to evaluate predictive accuracies with a single marker as well as with combined markers. Results: Twenty-six phage-displayed proteins have sequence identity with known or putative tumor-associated proteins. Immunochemical reactivity of patient sera with phage-expressed proteins showed that the autoantibodies to phage-expressed protein CENPF, DDX3, HSPA4, HSPA5, VIM, LMNB1, and TP53 had statistical significance in HCC patients. Measurements of the seven autoantibodies combined in a logistic regression model showed that combined measurements of these autoantibodies was more predictive of disease than any single antibody alone, underscoring the importance of identifying multiple potential markers. Conclusion: Autoantibody in the serum profiling is a promising approach for early detection and diagnosis of HCC. The panel of autoantibodies appears preferable to achieve superior accuracy rather than an autoantibody alone, and may have significant relevance to tumor biology, novel drug development, and immunotherapies.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate patient factors that influence patients\u2019 treatment options between breast cancer patients receiving breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and modified radical mastectomy (MRM). Methods: A total of 268 stage I\u2013II breast cancer patients treated with BCT in Tianjin Cancer Hospital, from January 2005 to January 2007, were compared with 200 randomly selected breast cancer patients (controls) treated with MRM. A personal health questionnaire (PHQ) was used to assess the factors that may affect the surgical decision making. Chi-squared test and multiple logistic regressions were used to examine factors associated with BCT. Results: BCT patients who were younger and were more likely to live in urban areas had medical insurance, higher levels of education and family income. Patients with medical insurance coverage were approximately six times more likely to receive BCT than patients without medical insurance after controlling for other potentially confounding factors. Similar results were also observed for family income. The observed differences cannot be explained by clinical aspects of their disease, such as tumor stage, estrogen receptor, and lymph node involvement. Conclusion: Breast cancer patients\u2019 socioeconomic status, rather than their clinical condition, is the predominant factor in determining whether a breast cancer patient receives BCT or not. These results provide a snapshot on how socioeconomic status influences cancer care provision in China. Future efforts should be made towards reducing discrepancies in treatment options for cancer patients caused by social class and socioeconomic status.",

     "abstract": "Background: Alcohol drinking is an oral cancer (OC) risk factor; tobacco smoking (TS) and betel quid chewing (BQC) are oral carcinogens and effect modifiers of drinking. Although the assessment of the independent effect of drinking on OC must necessarily account for effect modifiers, no observational study has included interaction terms between drinking, TS, BQC in regression analyses. In order to assess the independent association between drinking and OC, this pooled analysis focused on subjects who were not exposed to such effect modifiers. Methods: Case-control studies on OC, which discriminated non TS/non BQC drinkers from multiexposed drinkers were searched. Exposed subjects (\u22651 drink daily, \u226510 years) were compared to unexposed subjects (non/occasional drinkers). Unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) were extracted/calculated. Pooled ORs were assessed with the random-effect method, which assumed high between-study heterogeneity (assessed with Cochran's Q). Robustness of estimates was investigated through use of adjusted ORs, correction for publication bias, sensitivity analysis to inclusion criteria. The drinking\u2013TS interaction was assessed with the Interaction Contrast Ratio (ICR) and the Attributable Proportion due to Interaction (AP). Results: Sixteen studies were used, with substantially high heterogeneity. The pooled OR was 0.787 (95CI, 0.677\u20130.914). Use of adjusted ORs, correction for publication bias, sensitivity analysis corroborated these results. ICR and AP were 2.444 and 54.6%. Conclusions: Consistent with stratified analyses reporting non significant/negative associations between alcohol drinking and OC in non multiexposed subjects, an OC preventive activity of drinking is inferable. However, given the high prevalence and the oral carcinogenicity of concomitant drinking and smoking, drinking control policies remain essential.",

It is unclear whether these differences exist exclusively in the older adult population or whether they begin to emerge in children and young adults. Methods: Subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a03534) diagnosed with cancer under 30 years of age in Yorkshire between 1990 and 2005 were analysed. Differences in survival rates for diagnostic subgroups were estimated by ethnic group (south Asian or not) using Kaplan\u2013Meier estimation and Cox regression. Results: When compared to non-south Asians (all other ethnic groups excluding south Asians) a significant increased risk of death was seen for south Asians with leukaemia (hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a01.75; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.11\u20132.76) and lymphoma (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.05; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09\u20133.87), whereas south Asians with solid tumours other than central nervous system tumours had a significantly reduced risk of death(HR\u00a0=\u00a00.50; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.28\u20130.89). This was independent of socioeconomic deprivation. Conclusion: We found evidence of poorer survival outcomes for south Asians compared to non-south Asian children and young adults with leukaemia and lymphoma, but better outcomes for south Asian children and young adults with other solid tumours. This needs to be explained, and carefully addressed in the on-going development of cancer services.",

In contrast to many malignancies, survival in older patients has improved in NHL at a rate similar to that in younger patients. In the past, the impact of innovations on long-term survival of NHL patients on the population level has been disclosed only with substantial delay. Methods: We employ a novel model-based projection method to estimate survival expectations of NHL patients age 60+ diagnosed in 2008\u20132012. Preliminary empirical evaluation of the method using historical data indicates excellent performance in projection of age specific and overall 5- and 10-year relative survival. Results: Overall 5- and 10-year survival projections for 2008\u20132012 were 67.5% and 56.9%, respectively, 8.2 percentage units (% units) and 15.2% units, respectively, higher than the most recent survival estimates available from traditional cohort analysis. Projected survival decreased with age, ranging from 79.1% for patients age 60\u201364 to 54.3% for patients age 80+. Projected survival estimates for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma were 59% and 84.9%, respectively.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the risk of lung cancer and estimate the number of deaths due to indoor radon exposure in the north of Portugal, between 1995 and 2004. Methods: The sixth Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation Committee (BEIR VI) preferred models were applied to estimate the risk of developing lung cancer induced by indoor radon exposure, by age and level of exposure, and calculated the number of lung cancer deaths attributable to this exposure. Lung cancer mortality data were granted by the North Regional Health Administration and indoor radon concentrations resulted from a national survey conducted by the Portuguese Environmental Agency. The smoking habit was accounted with two methods. A submultiplicative interaction between smoking and indoor radon exposure was considered. Results: Depending on the model applied and the method used to account for the smoking habit, the estimated number of lung cancer deaths attributed to indoor radon exposure, in northern Portugal, ranges from 1565 to 2406, for the period between 1995 and 2004. This indicates that of the 8514 lung cancer deaths observed, from 18 to 28% could be associated with indoor radon exposure.This was the first study realized in Portugal on the impact of indoor radon exposure in lung cancer mortality.

     "abstract": "Exposure to tobacco carcinogens is the major cause of human lung cancer, but even heavy smokers have only about a 10% life-time risk of developing lung cancer. Currently used screening processes, based largely on age and exposure status, have proven to be of limited clinical utility in predicting cancer risk. More precise methods of assessing an individual's risk of developing lung cancer are needed. Because of their sensitivity to DNA damage, microsatellites are potentially useful for the assessment of somatic mutational load in normal cells. We assessed mutational load using hypermutable microsatellites in buccal cells obtained from lung carcinoma cases and controls to test if such a measure could be used to estimate lung cancer risk. There was no significant association between smoking status and mutation frequency with any of the markers tested. No significant association between case status and mutation frequency was observed. Age was significantly related to mutation frequency in the microsatellite marker D7S1482. These observations indicate that somatic mutational load, as measured using mutation frequency of microsatellites in buccal cells, increases with increasing age but that subjects who develop lung cancer have a similar mutational load as those who remain cancer free. This finding suggests that mutation frequency of microsatellite mutations in buccal cells may not be a promising biomarker for lung cancer risk.",

Treatment of HepG2 cells with EE-DS (20\u201380\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 48\u00a0h led to a significant dose-dependent increase in the percentage of cells in sub-G1 phase by analysis of the content of DNA in cells, and a large number of apoptotic bodies containing nuclear fragments were observed in cells treated with 80\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of EE-DS for 24\u00a0h by using Hoechst 33258 staining.

Treatment of cells with EE-DS (80\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 48\u00a0h resulted in significant increase of cytochrome c in the cytosol, which indicated cytochrome c release from mitochondria.

Methods: Cortisol and melatonin serum levels were measured in blood samples collected every 4\u00a0h for 24\u00a0h from eleven male controls and nine men suffering from non-small cell lung cancer. Circadian rhythmicity was evaluated and the 4-hourly fractional variations (FV) were calculated to evaluate the dynamics of the rise and fall in serum levels. Results: Overall cortisol serum levels were higher in cancer patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and lower for melatonin, but not significantly (p\u00a0=\u00a00.261). Original serum levels of cortisol and melatonin each showed a prominent 24\u00a0h oscillation in both study groups, with highest values at night for melatonin and near awakening for cortisol. Using all data after normalization to percent of individual mean, ANOVA detected a significant time-effect (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and cosinor analysis detected a significant 24\u00a0h rhythm (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in each group. Overall fractional variation (FV) levels were lower for cortisol in cancer patients and higher for melatonin, but these differences were not significant. FV levels of cortisol and melatonin each showed a prominent 24\u00a0h oscillation in both study groups, with highest values prior to darkness onset for melatonin and near mid-dark for cortisol. ANOVA also detected a significant time-effect (p\u00a0<\u00a00.002) and cosinor analysis detected a significant 24\u00a0h rhythm (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for FV in each group, with maximal FV preceding maximal serum levels by \u223c3\u00a0h for melatonin and \u223c5\u00a0h for cortisol. Conclusions: A chronobiological evaluation of serum levels and fractional variations for cortisol and especially melatonin is a valuable methodology to define body circadian phase in lung cancer patients. It is possible to describe the complex process of hormone secretion with a methodology that allows the definition of both temporal characteristics and dynamic components. Impact: This kind of analysis might be useful in the study of hormone secretion(s) in cancer patients and other diseases and to guide therapeutic interventions. While lung cancer patients may have a negative prognostic value based upon stage and/or other hormonal aspects of their hypothalamus\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid\u2013adrenal axis function, patients that nevertheless maintain circadian rhythmicity in key body rhythm markers may still be eligible candidates for a chronotherapeutic approach of treatment(s).",

     "abstract": "Cancer screening has been effective in detecting tumors early before symptoms appear. However, the effectiveness of the regular fecal occult blood test (FOBT) in colorectal cancer in the long term has not been quantified.We applied the statistical method developed by Wu and Rosner [1] using data from the Minnesota Colon Cancer Control Study (MCCCS). All initially asymptomatic participants were classified into four mutually exclusive groups: true-early-detection, no-early-detection, over-diagnosis, and symptom-free life; human lifetime was treated as a random variable and is subject to competing risks. All participants in the screening program will eventually fall into one of the four outcomes above. Predictive inferences on the percentages of the four outcomes for both genders were made using the Minnesota study data.Depending on gender, screening frequency and age at the initial screening, for all participants the probability of \u201csymptom-free-life\u201d varies between 95.3% and 96.6%; the probability of \u201ctrue-early-detection\u201d is 1.9\u20133.8%; the probability of no-early-detection is 0.3\u20132.0%; the probability of over-diagnosis is 0.16\u20130.3%. Among those with colorectal cancer detected by regular FOBT, the probability of over-diagnosis is lower than expected and is between 6% and 9%, with 95% CI (2.5%, 21.3%) for females and (1.9%, 44.7%) for males. The probability of true-early-detection increases as screening interval decreases. The probability of no-early-detection decreases as screening interval decreases.The probability of over-diagnosis among the screen-detected cases is not as high as previously thought. We hope this outcome can provide valuable information on the effectiveness of the FOBT in colorectal cancer detection in the long term.",

     "abstract": "Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis occurs in various organs, most frequently in liver. Serological examination including tumor and biochemical markers for liver function evaluation is routinely performed, though its accuracy is not high. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in a variety of human diseases including cancer, and have many characteristics of an ideal biomarker most notably their inherent stability and resilience. Recently, several studies have indicated that circulating miRNAs hold much potential as novel noninvasive biomarkers for cancer and other disease processes. The objective of this study was to investigate the potential of serum miRNAs as novel biomarkers for CRC with liver metastasis. Methods: This study was divided into three phases: (I) 3 candidate serum miRNAs were detected by using real-time RT-PCR, corresponding 38 CRC patients with liver metastasis and 36 CRC patients without metastasis. (II) Marker validation by real-time RT-PCR on a similar cohort of age- and sex-matched CRC patients without (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and with liver metastasis (n\u00a0=\u00a020). (III) We examined the correlation between the expressions of candidate serum miRNAs with clinical parameters of CRC patients. Results: Serum miR-29a was significantly higher in colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) patients than in CRC patients. This marker yielded a receiver operating characteristic curve area of 80.3%. At a cutoff value of 0.155, the sensitivity was 75% and the specificity was 75% in discriminating metastatic from non-metastatic patients. In addition, increased levels of miR-29a expression were also observed in colorectal tumors from CRLM patients compared with CRC patients. No significant difference was observed in the levels of serum miR-92a between metastatic and non-metastatic patients. Conclusions: These findings suggest that serum miR-29a has strong potential as a novel noninvasive biomarker for early detection of CRC with liver metastasis.",

Methods: We searched multiple databases to identify genetic association studies investigating the effect of rs1136201 on breast cancer risk. For each study we calculated unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) with their variance under additive, dominant, recessive and allele-frequency genetic models. Summary ORs with their corresponding confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random effects models. Results: Based on the 33 case\u2013control studies reporting data for the additive genetic model (20,461 cases/23,832 controls) we did not find evidence of an association between rs1136201 and breast cancer, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.05 (95% CI, 0.99\u20131.11), with significant between-study heterogeneity (pQ\u00a0<\u00a00.001; I2\u00a0=\u00a049%).

The highest incidence rates for oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers were registered in Pakistan, India, France, Slovakia and Brazil. This paper presents predictions of incidence rates of the most common cancers in the head and neck in Spain. Objective: This paper presents predictions of incidence rates of the most common cancers in the head and neck regions for the period 2003\u20132017, grouped in periods of five years (2003\u20132007, 2008\u20132012, 2013\u20132017), based on incidence data from five Population-Based Cancer Registries in Spain. Methods: Cancer registries published in Cancer Incidence in Five Continents vols. VII\u2013IX with a minimum of 15 years of continuous data were selected. The selected topographies were: oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx and hypopharynx. Predictions were made using the Nordpred program, utilizing the age\u2013period\u2013cohort model. Results: For the period between 2013 and 2017, 4542 cases of head and neck cancers were predicted for men and 810 for women, with a proportion of 5.6 men to one woman. Cancers of the oral cavity, larynx and hypopharynx in men presented an increasing number of cases due to demographic changes, but the risk will be reduced by 2% for oral cavity cancer, 28% for laryngeal cancer, 3% for hypopharyngeal cancer and 4% for grouped locations. Oropharyngeal cancer in men has a predicted increase of 47% due to risk. Predictions for the female gender suggest an increment in all locations, with an increased risk of 24% for the oral cavity, 37% for the larynx, and 67% for grouped locations. Conclusion: Predictions show a reduction in gender difference in the incidence of head and neck cancers. There was a reduction in incidence rates for men and an increase for women, evidencing changes in exposure to tobacco and alcohol.",

     "abstract": "Background: Epidemiology of gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) is sparsely described. We report a population-based consecutive case series of GIST over three decades from south-western Norway. Methods: All mesenchymal tumours registered at Stavanger University Hospital between 1980 and 2009 were reviewed and those of the gastrointestinal tract were reclassified with regard to histomorphology and/or immunohistochemistry profiles consistent with GIST. Reported are patients\u2019 characteristics and GIST incidence and prevalence estimated using population statistics. Results: Fifty-two cases were identified; 62% of the patients were women. Median age at diagnosis was 67 years. Fifty-eight percent of the tumours were located in the stomach, 38% in the small bowel and one each in colon and rectum. One third were considered to be high risk according to the NIH consensus criteria. The crude incidence rate of GIST was 1.8 per million in the study population per year in the 5-year period 1980\u20131984, and increased to around 6 in the following years with a peak at 12.5 per million in 2000\u20132004. The over all crude incidence rate for 1980\u20132009 was 6.5 per million (95% CI 4.8\u20138.3 per mill.). Standardized age- and gender adjusted incidence for Norway was 7.4 per million (95% CI 5.4\u20139.4). The number of patients alive with GIST increased over the study period, with a peak in 2000\u20132004 at 92.1 per million (95% CI 60.7\u2013134.0 per mill.). One in five had an additional gastrointestinal cancer, located in the colon (n\u00a0=\u00a06), rectum (n\u00a0=\u00a02), stomach (n\u00a0=\u00a03) or, pancreas (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Conclusion: Incidence of GIST in the south-western part of Norway is relatively stable and towards the lower end of the range reported in the worldwide literature. An increasing prevalence likely reflects therapy effects. Synchronous gastrointestinal cancers are relatively common in patients with GIST.",

     "abstract": "Background: The long tenure of the Doubs cancer registry (France) and the late implementation of a mass screening program provide a unique opportunity to assess the relative contributions of age, period and cohort effects to the increase in female invasive breast cancer incidence, while avoiding the influence of an organized screening program. Methods: Population and incidence data were provided for the Doubs region during the 1978\u20132003 period. Breast cancer counts and person-years were tabulated into 1-year classes by age and time period. Age-period-cohort models with parametric smooth functions were fitted to the data, assuming a Poisson distribution for the number of observed cases. Results: A total of 5688 incident cases of invasive breast cancer in women were diagnosed in women aged 30\u201384 years in the Doubs region between 1978 and 2003. The annual percentage increase in incidence is 2.09%. Age effects rise dramatically until age 50, and at a slower pace afterwards. Large cohort curvature effects (p\u00a0<\u00a010\u22126), show departure from linear trends, with a significant peak for women born around 1940. Period curvature effects are lower in magnitude (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Conclusion: Both cohort and period effects are involved in the marked increase in breast cancer incidence over a 25-year period in the Doubs region. Although the future trend for breast cancer incidence is difficult to predict, the introduction of an organized screening program, and the sharp decline in hormone replacement therapy use will likely contribute to period effects in future analyses.",

Methods: We included 303,648 English and 24,919 Norwegian cases of breast cancer diagnosed 1996\u20132004 using flexible parametric relative survival models, enabling improved quantification of differences in survival. Crude probabilities were estimated to partition the probability of death due to all causes into that due to cancer and other causes and to estimate the number of \u201cavoidable\u201d deaths. Results: England had lower relative survival for all ages with the difference increasing with age. Much of the difference was due to higher excess mortality in England in the first few months after diagnosis. Older patients had a higher proportion of deaths due to other causes. At 5 years post diagnosis, a woman aged 85 in England had probabilities of 0.35 of dying of cancer and 0.32 of dying of other causes, whilst in Norway they were 0.26 and 0.35. By eight years the number of \u201cavoidable\u201d all-cause deaths in England was 1020 with the number of \u201cavoidable\u201d breast cancer related deaths 1488.

Results have been remarkably consistent, but there is still no explanation for this increase. In this study we evaluated the effect of 60\u00a0Hz magnetic fields on acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) in the State of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Methods: This case\u2013control study included ALL cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0162) recruited from eight hospitals between January 2003 and February 2009. Controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0565) matched on gender, age, and city of birth were selected from the S\u00e3o Paulo Birth Registry. Exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF MF) was based on measurements inside home and distance to power lines. Results: For 24\u00a0h measurements in children rooms, levels of ELF MF equal to or greater than 0.3\u00a0microtesla (\u03bcT), compared to children exposed to levels below 0.1\u00a0\u03bcT showed no increased risk of ALL (odds ratio [OR] 1.09; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.33\u20133.61). When only nighttime measurements were considered, a risk (OR 1.52; 95% CI 0.46\u20135.01) was observed. Children living within 200\u00a0m of power lines presented an increased risk of ALL (OR 1.67; 95% CI 0.49\u20135.75), compared to children living at 600\u00a0m or more of power lines. For those living within 50\u00a0m of power lines the OR was 3.57 (95% CI 0.41\u201331.44). Conclusions: Even though our results are consistent with the small risks reported in other studies on ELF MF and leukemia in children, overall our results do not provide support for an association between magnetic fields and childhood leukemia, but small numbers and likely biases weaken the strength of this conclusion.",

Method: We examined this association in the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) that was conducted in Hawaii and Los Angeles with nearly 186,000 participants in five ethnic groups. Over a median 10.7 years of follow-up, 918 incident cases of urothelial cancer (89% bladder and 11% other urinary tract sites) were identified through tumor registry linkages. Results: A self-reported diagnosis of diabetes was associated with an increased risk of urothelial cancer (relative risk\u00a0=\u00a01.25; 95% confidence interval: 1.04\u20131.50). The association was not explained by body mass index, physical activity, or smoking. There was some suggestion that the risk was higher in women, Whites and African Americans, and past smokers. The risk associated with diabetes for in situ and localized cancer was similar to that for regional and distant cancer. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the increased urothelial cancer risk with diabetes in this multiethnic population is very similar to that observed in mostly White or Asian populations. Whether or not the elevated risk is moderated by the degree of control of the hyperglycemia associated with diabetes will need to be determined in future studies.",

Results: The \u2212509TT genotype was significantly associated with a decreased risk for ductal breast carcinoma (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.47, CI: 0.26\u20130.82, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Similarly, the \u2212509T was significantly less in ductal breast cancer patients (34.4%) than in control individuals (41.6%; OR\u00a0=\u00a00.74, CI: 0.57\u20130.96, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). With the exception of association between the \u2212509TT genotype and large tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), there was no significant association between the studied polymorphism and clinicopathological characteristics. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that polymorphism of TGF-\u03b21 \u2212509C>T gene may modify individual susceptibility to infiltrating ductal breast carcinoma in Russian women of Western Siberian region.",

However, the role of genetic polymorphism of X-ray cross-complementing group 3 (XRCC3) Thr241Met (rs#861539), which may be involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks caused by carcinogens such as CagA, a protein produced by H. pylori, has been less well elaborated. Methods: We conducted a hospital-based case\u2013control study, including 721 patients with pathologically confirmed GAA and 989 individually matched controls without any evidence of tumors or precancerous lesions to evaluate the associations between this polymorphism and GAA risk in the Guangxi population. XRCC3 codon 241 genotypes and CagA status were determined using TaqMan-PCR and PCR, respectively. Results: Increased risks of GAA were found for cagA-positive individuals [odds ratio (OR), 7.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.87\u20139.09]. We also found that individuals with the XRCC3 genotypes with codon 241 Met (namely XRCC3-TM or XRCC3-MM) had an increased risk of GAA compared with those with the homozygote of XRCC3 codon 241 Thr alleles (namely XRCC3-TT, adjusted ORs 1.76 and 3.73; 95% CIs 1.37\u20132.24 and 2.66\u20135.23, respectively). The risk of GAA, moreover, appeared to differ more significantly among individuals featuring cagA-positive status, whose adjusted ORs (95% CIs) were 11.31 (8.34\u201315.33) and 27.48 (15.17\u201349.78), respectively.

     "abstract": "Introduction: Many studies have investigated the immediate impact of physical activity on prolactin concentrations; however, it is currently unclear what impact exercise may have on prolactin concentrations in the long-term, particularly among women. Understanding the role of exercise on prolactin is important because epidemiologic studies have reported increased risks of breast cancer in association with high prolactin concentrations. We investigated whether exercise alters serum prolactin concentrations at two time points within a one-year exercise intervention. Methods: Out of 96 women aged 40\u201375 years, 47 were randomized to a 12-month regimen of moderate-intensity physical activity and 49 were randomized to the control group. Participants in the exercise group (exercisers) took part in exercise at gym facilities 3 times per week and 3 times per week on their own. Serum prolactin was collected from participants at baseline, 3 and 12 months. Using generalized linear models, we compared the percent change in prolactin concentrations from baseline to the two follow-up time points in the exercisers versus the control group. Results: While we observed the suggestion of differences in the change in serum prolactin concentrations in some subgroups, overall there was no difference in the change in prolactin concentrations between exercisers and controls at 3 months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.57) or 12 months (p\u00a0=\u00a00.42). Conclusion: Our study does not support the hypothesis that long-term exercise influences serum prolactin concentrations.",

Objective: To examine whether information about risks and benefits of cancer screening leads to a higher satisfaction with the decision that was made. Methods: Randomized mail survey in the general population, among 2333 adults aged 30\u201360 years. The survey included a hypothetical cancer screening scenario that included varying amounts of information about benefits and risks of screening (factorial randomized design). The decision process was evaluated by a 6 item scale, with scores between 0 (lowest score) and 100 (highest score). Results: Substantial proportions of respondents \u201ccompletely agreed\u201d that the decision reflected what was most important to them (61.2%), were satisfied with their decision (56.0%), were certain of their decision (54.1%), thought that the best choice for them was obvious (53.5%) and that the decision was easy to make (44.1%). The Cronbach alpha coefficient of the scale was 0.88, the mean score was 82.5, and the standard deviation 17.5. Providing information about benefits increased the decision evaluation score only modestly (+1.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.11); in contrast, providing information about risks sharply reduced the score (\u22125.1, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Little information is available about incidence and mortality of NETs in the World population. The objective of this study was to report the incidence and survival of these tumors in Girona Province. Methods: We include all ICD-O3 codes that codified a NET, period 1994\u20132004. Data from malignant NETs came directly from the Girona Cancer Registry, and data from benign or with uncertain behavior NETs directly from the Anatomic-Pathological Laboratories. Results: We identified 698 NETs, the most frequent were those aroused in the bronco-pulmonary system (65.75%), followed by the gastro-entero-pancreatics (GEP) (12.75%). Small cell lung carcinomas were the most frequent NETs of the bronco-pulmonary system (92.59%), with an age-standardized incidence rate (ASRw, world population standard) of 4.29/100,000 person-years. Carcinoid lung tumors had an ASRw of 0.32/100,000 person-years and a 5-year relative survival (RS) of 77%. The ASRw of GEP NETs was 1.07/100,000 person-years, and the 5-year RS was 95%. The 5-year RS of pancreas was 43%. Thyroid NETs had an ASRw of 0.17/100,000 person-years, and a 5-year RS of 75%. Pheocromocytomas had an ASRw of 0.47/100,000 person-years and a 5-year RS of 85%. Merkel cell carcinomas had an ASRw of 0.11/100,000 person-years, with a 5-year RS of 50%. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first population-based study reporting incidence of NETs in Spain. Our data was consistent with other European reports. By providing the incidence and survival of NETs in Girona Province, this study contributes to a better understanding of these rare tumors.",

The incidence trends were estimated and compared using regression analysis.The incidence was significantly higher in the coastal areas. The incidence rate in 2007 was higher for men than for women, whereas the average growth of the incidence was higher among women.This study shows that another important aspect regarding sun exposure, apart from latitude, is whether an area lies in the inland or on the coast.

Preventive actions are needed; and perhaps extra information should be given to people living on the coast, who have a higher sun exposure.",

We assessed the validity of self-reported cancer diagnoses in women born 1921\u20131926 recruited to the Australian Longitudinal Study in Women's Health (ALSWH) and determined the factors associated with false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) reporting. 4234 ALSWH cohort members were asked at baseline (1996) and in subsequent three-yearly surveys whether they had been diagnosed with specific cancers, including breast, cervical, lung and colorectal. We linked the cohort to the population-based New South Wales Central Cancer Registry (CCR) from 1972 to 2005 to identify registered invasive cancers. We calculated sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) of self-reported cancer diagnoses overall, at baseline (prevalent cancers) and follow-up (incident cancers) using the CCR diagnosis as the \u2018gold standard\u2019. We used adjusted logistic regression to examine the determinants of FP and FN reports. Overall sensitivity was 89.2% (95% CI 86.0\u201391.7%) and exceeded 90% for breast, lung and colorectal cancer at baseline. Overall specificity was 96.9% (95% CI 96.3\u201397.5%), however, PPV was lower at 66.5% (95% CI 62.7\u201370.1%). FN reporting of any cancer at baseline was associated with being born overseas. Sensitivity and specificity of self-reported cancer diagnoses in this cohort of older women (aged 70\u201375 years at baseline) is high but PPV is comparatively lower.

While this suggests a possible etiologic role of female sex hormones, clear associations between hormonal and reproductive factors and thyroid cancer have not been observed. However, few large prospective studies have been conducted. Methods: Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hormonal and reproductive factors and incident thyroid cancer were estimated using Cox regression methods in the prospective US NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Between 1995 and 2006, 312 first primary incident thyroid cancers were diagnosed among 187,865 postmenopausal women ages 50\u201371 at baseline. Results: Thyroid cancer was not associated with ages at menarche or menopause, menopause type, or parity.

Methods: We investigated the interaction between VDR polymorphisms and sun exposure in a population-based multinational study comparing 1138 patients with a multiple (second or subsequent) primary melanoma (cases) to 2151 patients with a first primary melanoma (controls); essentially a case\u2013control study of melanoma in a population of melanoma survivors.

     "abstract": "Background: To achieve a reduction in breast cancer mortality in Poland a nation-wide population-based screening was introduced in 2007. Aim: To assess the quality of breast cancer screening programme during the first round of operation in Lower Silesia\u2014a region of over 3 million inhabitants. Methods: Women aged 50\u201369 are invited for screening, with the exception of those undergoing treatment or being followed up after treatment for breast cancer. Biennial two-view screen-film mammography is used as the standard screening test. Quality evaluation was carried out via early performance indicators. These parameters were calculated according to European Guidelines and compared with recommended levels. Results: Only 40% of women from the eligible population were screened. Among programme attendees the technical recall rate (a repeat mammogram because of technical inadequacy of the screening mammogram) was 0.27%. Further assessment rate (additional diagnostic techniques, either non-invasive or invasive, performed for medical reasons in order to clarify the nature of a perceived abnormality detected at the screening mammography) was 6.2%, while the short-term recall rate (early re-screen mammography at an interval less than the routine round length of the programme) was 2.4%. Cancer detection rate was 6.6/1000 while cancer detection rate expressed as a multiple of the expected breast cancer incidence rate was 3.8. Positive predictive values of the screening test and the further assessment were 11% and 77%, respectively. Conclusion: The general assessment using early indicators reveals that diagnostic service conforms to the European standards on an acceptable or even desirable level. The only exception among these parameters is a too high short-term recall rate, which should be drastically decreased during the next rounds to improve the cost-effectiveness. The main disadvantage of the screening programme at its start is a dramatically poor coverage of the eligible population. If the invitation policy is not significantly intensified the breast cancer mortality rate will not be reduced, despite the good quality of diagnostic service.",

In this work, genotype\u2013phenotype correlations focused on selected clinical features were performed in 100 Italian FAM unrelated patients. Molecular studies of CDKN2A mutations were performed by direct sequencing.

MPM, >2 affected family members, Breslow thickness >0.4\u00a0mm, and age at onset \u226441 years were the unique independent features predicting positive CDKN2A screening. The rate of positive testing ranged from 93.2% in the presence of all of them, to 0.4% in their absence. The contribution of each of them was quantified accordingly, with MPM being the most significant.

Changes over time were related to organisation and technology. Methods: Individualized data were retrieved on outcome of screening mammography, assessment, surgery, and interval cancers. European Guideline performance indicators were calculated, supplemented with false positive and interval cancer rates per 1000 screens. False positive tests were divided into those sorted out at assessment (Type 1) and at surgery (Type 2). Results: In total, 1392 invasive breast cancers/ductal carcinoma in situ cases (DCIS) were diagnosed, giving an overall detection rate of 7.6 per 1000 screens. Of 5178 false positive tests, 4666 were Type 1 and 512 Type 2. The 468 interval cancers constituted 25% of all breast cancers (=screen detected\u00a0+\u00a0interval cancer). Almost all outcome measures were well within the desirable level of the European Guidelines. Risk of Type 2 false positive tests was positively associated with detection rate especially at initial screen, and interval cancer rate was negatively associated with detection rate. This association was decoupled after introduction of high resolution ultrasound and stereotactic breast biopsies, resulting in a Benign-to-Malignant-Ratio (BMR) of 1:11.40. Conclusion: Mammography screening is a delicate balance between benefits and risks. Increase in detection rate came at cost of increase in risk of benign biopsies. Introduction of new technologies broke this pattern and a slight increase in detection rate coincided with an unprecedentedly low BMR.",

     "abstract": "Background: Implementation of mammography screening and advances in breast cancer treatment are considered as main reasons for the decline in breast cancer mortality observed in many industrialized countries during the past two decades. The purpose of this study was to provide a comprehensive assessment of trends in breast cancer incidence, mortality and survival by age and stage in Germany. Methods: Data from the population based Saarland Cancer Registry including patients diagnosed with breast cancer from 1972 to 2007 were used. Period analysis methods were employed to calculate 5-year relative survival and its trends. Results: Mortality started to decline during the 1990s, and a previous increase in incidence levelled off in the early 21st century. Overall age-standardized 5-year relative survival of invasive breast cancer steadily increased during the past three decades to 83% in 2004\u20132008. This increase was mostly due to an increase in survival for patients with localized cancers and locally or regionally spread tumours (increase of age-standardized 5-year relative survival from 92% to 98% and from 65% to 80%, respectively, between 1992 and 2008), whereas age-standardized 5-year relative survival essentially remained unchanged at levels close to 21% in patients with metastasized cancer. For women aged 70 years or older 5-year relative survival and its increase over time were inferior compared to younger patients. Conclusions: The observed trends in population based survival suggest that advances in treatment of early breast cancer have substantially contributed to the gain in prognosis. The poor prognosis of metastasized breast cancer patients and the increasing age gradient in 5-year relative survival call for enhanced efforts for early detection and more rigorous treatment of elderly patients.",

Methods: Death details were obtained from the WHO Mortality Database for the UK, the USA and 11 European countries. Mortality rates were calculated for the age groups 55\u201364, 65\u201374, 75\u201384 and \u226585 years. Trends between 1995\u201397 and 2003\u201305 were determined.

Results: For all cancers combined, UK rates for 2003\u201305 in those aged \u226575 years were 11\u201331% higher than in other regions. From 1995\u201397 to 2003\u201305, UK rates decreased by 16\u201317% in those aged <75 years, but increased by 2% in those \u226585 years compared with decreases of 4\u201316% for the other geographic areas. More than 14,000 cancer deaths in the UK in those aged \u226575 years would be avoided each year if UK mortality rates were identical to those in the USA.

Some populations are more prone to develop stomach cancer, such as people with low socioeconomic status (SES). The aim of this population based study was to assess whether differences in socioeconomic status (SES) alone, after adjusting for confounding factors, also influence survival. Methods: From 1989 to 2007 all patients with stomach cancer were selected from the cancer registry of the Comprehensive Cancer Centre North-East. Postal code at diagnosis was used to determine SES, dividing patients in three groups; low, intermediate and high SES. Associations between age, localization, grade, stage, and treatment were determined using Chi-square analysis. Relative survival analysis was used to estimate relative excess risk (RER) of dying according to SES. Results: In low SES neighbourhoods diagnosis was established at older age. More distal tumours were detected in patients with low SES, whereas pathology showed more poorly differentiated tumours in patients with high SES. Overall, more resections were performed in, and more chemotherapy was administrated to patients in high SES neighbourhoods. After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk of dying was lower for patients with high SES (RER 0.89, 95% Confidence Interval 0.81\u20130.98) compared to patients with low SES. Conclusion: SES proved to be an independent prognostic factor for survival in patients with stomach cancer.",

Methods: A total of 127,753 patients with colon cancer were identified who were diagnosed between 1992 and 2006 in the US Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program. Marital status consisted of married, single, separated/divorced and widowed. Chi-square tests were used to examine the association between marital status and other variables. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to estimate survival curves. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to estimate the effect of marital status on survival. Results: Married patients were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage (and for men also at an older age) compared with single and separated/divorced patients, and more likely to receive surgical treatment than all other marital groups (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The five-year survival rate for the single was six percentage points lower than the married for both men and women. After controlling for age, race, cancer stage and surgery receipt, married patients had a significantly lower risk of death from cancer (for men, HR: 0.86, CI: 0.82\u20130.90; for women, HR: 0.87, CI: 0.83\u20130.91) compared with the single. Within the same cancer stage, the survival differences between the single and the married were strongest for localized and regional stages, which had overall middle-range survival rates compared to in situ or distant stage so that support from marriage could make a big difference.

     "abstract": "Background: Cutaneous malignant melanoma is a major public health issue in Australia and other nations. A greater understanding of the genetic determinants and their interactions with environmental factors may lead to better interventions and control of the disease. The Western Australian Melanoma Health Study (WAMHS) is a population-based case-collection and biospecimen resource established to investigate the genetic epidemiology of melanoma. This manuscript discusses the design of the WAMHS and the characteristics of the participants. Methods: Participants were recruited through the Western Australian Cancer Registry, which is notified of all incident cancers in the state of Western Australia by law. Once the diagnosing doctor's consent was obtained, all eligible, resident Western Australian, adult cases of melanoma diagnosed between January 2006 and September 2009, were contacted by mail and invited to participate. Clinical, questionnaire-based phenotypic and blood samples for extraction of DNA, RNA and serum were collected from consenting cases. Clinical data consisted of all pathological data recorded by the cancer registry and the questionnaire, administered by telephone interview, covered major risk factors for melanoma, such as sun exposure history and skin type. Results: The final sample consisted of 1643 consenting cases out of 3420 cancer notifications (48.04%), of which 1455 cases completed one or more components of the study and 1157 completed all components. The WAMHS sample differed to all melanoma notifications only in age, with a bias towards older individuals (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). No significant differences were observed in sex, melanoma site, Breslow thickness or Clark's level. Conclusions: The WAMHS study is novel in its non-family based approach and focus on common (low penetrance) genetic determinants. This comprehensive resource will enable further steps to be taken towards understanding the complex pathways involved in melanoma.",

Results: A high WHR (<0.77, \u22650.77 to <0.81, \u22650.81\u00a0cm/cm) was associated with a statistically significantly lower overall risk for EOC (RR 0.60; 0.36\u20131.00; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.04), particularly tumours of differentiation grades 1 and 2 (RR 0.27; 0.09\u20130.81; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and clinical stages 1 and 2 (RR 0.32; 0.10\u20130.97; p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and these associations were stronger in postmenopausal women. Neither height, weight, BMI, body fat percentage, waist- or hip circumference were associated with overall risk, nor with risk for different subtypes, differentiation grade or stage. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that a high WHR is associated with a decreased risk of EOC. Other anthropometric factors were not associated with EOC risk.",

Large population-based studies on the incidence, risk factors and prognosis of synchronous CRC are, however, scarce, and are needed for better determination of risks of synchronous CRC in patients diagnosed with colonic neoplasia. Methods: All newly diagnosed CRC between 1995 and 2006 were obtained from the Rotterdam Cancer Registry in The Netherlands, and studied for synchronous CRC. Results: Of the 13,683 patients diagnosed with CRC, 534 patients (3.9%) were diagnosed with synchronous CRC. The risk of having synchronous CRC was significantly higher in men (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.29\u20131.84) and in patients aged >70\u00a0years (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.39\u20132.40).

Methods: In a nested case\u2013control study, we compared the breast density of 667 controls and 607 breast cancer cases among women of Caucasian, Japanese, and Native Hawaiian ancestry in the Hawaii component of the Multiethnic Cohort Study. A reader blinded to disease status performed computer assisted density assessment on prediagnostic mammograms. Receptor status was obtained from the statewide Hawaii Tumor Registry. Tumors were classified into ER+PR+ (n\u00a0=\u00a0341), ER\u2212PR\u2212 (n\u00a0=\u00a050), ER+PR\u2212/ER\u2212PR+ (n\u00a0=\u00a064), and unstaged/unknown (n\u00a0=\u00a0152).

Methods: A case\u2013control study of 1105 patients with newly diagnosed acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma) and 2145 controls was conducted in 13 countries using a common protocol. Past mobile phone use was assessed by personal interview. In the primary analysis, exposure time was censored at one year before the reference date (date of diagnosis for cases and date of diagnosis of the matched case for controls); analyses censoring exposure at five years before the reference date were also done to allow for a possible longer latent period. Results: The odds ratio (OR) of acoustic neuroma with ever having been a regular mobile phone user was 0.85 (95% confidence interval 0.69\u20131.04). The OR for \u226510 years after first regular mobile phone use was 0.76 (0.52\u20131.11). There was no trend of increasing ORs with increasing cumulative call time or cumulative number of calls, with the lowest OR (0.48 (0.30\u20130.78)) observed in the 9th decile of cumulative call time. In the 10th decile (\u22651640\u00a0h) of cumulative call time, the OR was 1.32 (0.88\u20131.97); there were, however, implausible values of reported use in those with \u22651640\u00a0h of accumulated mobile phone use. With censoring at 5 years before the reference date the OR for \u226510 years after first regular mobile phone use was 0.83 (0.58\u20131.19) and for \u22651640\u00a0h of cumulative call time it was 2.79 (1.51\u20135.16), but again with no trend in the lower nine deciles and with the lowest OR in the 9th decile. In general, ORs were not greater in subjects who reported usual phone use on the same side of the head as their tumour than in those who reported it on the opposite side, but it was greater in those in the 10th decile of cumulative hours of use. Conclusions: There was no increase in risk of acoustic neuroma with ever regular use of a mobile phone or for users who began regular use 10 years or more before the reference date. Elevated odds ratios observed at the highest level of cumulative call time could be due to chance, reporting bias or a causal effect. As acoustic neuroma is usually a slowly growing tumour, the interval between introduction of mobile phones and occurrence of the tumour might have been too short to observe an effect, if there is one.",

Nor are there any data on the population-based prevalence of high-risk (HR) human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which, in the absence of good-quality screening, is known to correlate with cervical cancer incidence. Methods: We obtained cervical cell specimens from 1309 women aged 18\u201359 years from the general population of Tbilisi, and also from 91 locally diagnosed invasive cervical cancers (ICC). DNA of 44 HPV types was tested for using a GP5+/6+-based PCR assay. Results: In the general population (of whom 2% reported a previous Pap smear) HPV prevalence was 13.5% (95% CI: 11.6\u201315.9), being highest in women aged 25\u201334 years (18.7%) and falling to between 8.6% and 9.5% for all age groups above 34 years. HR HPV prevalence was 8.6% overall, being 6.8% and 38.9% among women with normal and abnormal cytology, respectively. HPV45 (1.6%) was the most common type in women with normal cytology, whereas HPV16 predominated among women with cervical abnormalities (including 7 of 10 histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2/3) and among ICC (57.6%). The next most common types in ICC in Georgia were HPV45 and 18 (13.2 and 11.0%, respectively). Conclusions: We report a relatively high burden of HPV infection in Tbilisi, Georgia. Improving cervical cancer prevention, through screening and/or HPV vaccination, is an important public health issue in Georgia, where 70% of ICC are theoretically preventable by HPV16/18 vaccines.",

All patients with other hematological malignancies as well as the normal subjects did not harbour the virus. These findings support the previous reports of frequent detection of HHV-8 in bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients.",

Our current study further assessed the possibility that leukocyte aggregates may harbor detached individual tumor cell or clusters of tumor cells. Materials and methods: Tissue sections from patients with pregnancy-associated breast cancer (PABC) and controls were subjected to morphological and immunohistochemical assessment with a panel of leukocyte and tumor cell related markers. Results: A total of 63 leukocyte aggregates were detected in the 20 PABC cases studied. Of these, 55 (87%) were distributed within normal or hyperplastic lobules adjacent to invasive lesions. Over 70% of these leukocyte aggregates harbored detached individual tumor cell or cell clusters with malignant properties, including strong p53 positivity, elevated proliferation, reduced cell surface adhesion molecules, and cytological resemblance to adjacent invasive cancer cells. A significant number of these tumor cells or condensed chromosomes of mitotic tumor cells were observed to conjoin with the plasma membrane of leukocytes. Similar alterations were seen in leukocyte aggregates within the inter-lobular space and in non-PABC with a lower frequency. Conclusions: These findings suggest that leukocyte infiltration may trigger dissemination of tumor cells from their primary site, and that leukocyte aggregates may serve as a reservoir for disseminated tumor cells that may be physically dragged to distant sites by leukocytes during their migration.",

Two key steps in the sex steroid synthesis are mediated by the enzyme cytochrome P450c 17\u03b1 which is encoded in the CYP17 gene. The A2 allele of the CYP17 gene has been thought to be associated with increased functional activity of this steroidogenic enzyme. Consequently, the A2 allele has been examined as a biomarker of individual susceptibility to hormone-related diseases among men. We prospectively assessed the association between the A2 allele of CYP17 and PCa risk among 125 cases and 125 controls in a case\u2013control study. Our aim was to investigate whether a polymorphism of CYP17 gene could be used as a genetic marker for associating PCa. The result revealed a significant association between the CYP17 polymorphic genotypes and PCa. Therefore, CYP17 gene polymorphism is likely contributed to the pathogenesis of PCa but not to disease severity.",

     "abstract": "Background: Resistin-like molecules (RELM) are expressed in many tissues and among those, RELM\u03b2 is most abundantly expressed in the colon. Based on animal studies, RELM\u03b2 is induced by high fat diets, obesity, and intestinal microflora and may play a role in insulin resistance and intestinal inflammation. In the present study, we evaluated whether RELM\u03b2 could be measured in human plasma and the influence of selected host and behavioral factors on RELM\u03b2 levels, including known risk factors for colorectal cancer. Methods: The subjects for this pilot study were derived from healthy controls who participated in a population-based case\u2013control study of colorectal cancer in Metropolitan Detroit. The subjects were 45\u201380 years of age without history of cancer or colorectal resection. Results: RELM\u03b2 was present in human plasma, with levels in the range of 0.08\u20130.26\u00a0ng/mL. Lower RELM\u03b2 levels were found in subjects with non-Caucasian race, lower pack-years of smoking, and higher physical activity index scores. Other variables such as dietary intakes, gender, obesity, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and history of polyps were not associated with RELM\u03b2 levels. Conclusions: The direct association of RELM\u03b2 with smoking and inverse association with physical activity, both of which are risk factors for colon cancer, indicates that RELM\u03b2 may be involved in mediating the effects of these two lifestyle factors on risk of colon cancer.",

Parental infertility and infertility treatment may be associated with GCT development but these risk factors have not been fully investigated.A case\u2013control study of childhood GCT was conducted through the Children's Oncology Group (COG). Cases, under the age of 15 years at diagnosis, were recruited through COG institutions from January 1993 to December 2002. Controls were obtained through random digit dialing. Information about infertility and infertility treatment along with demographic factors was collection through maternal interviews. Subgroups created by gender, age at diagnosis, and tumor location were examined separately. Statistical analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression models.Overall, no association between GCT and infertility or its treatment was found.

The purpose of this study was to examine the association of two genetic polymorphisms in XRCC1 (rs1799782 and rs25487) with risk of colorectal polyps and colorectal cancer (CRC). Methods: In the ongoing colorectal cancer study of Austria (CORSA), a total of 3091 Caucasian participants was genotyped using 5\u2032-nuclease TaqMan assays. Multiple logistic regression was applied to compare individuals of the control group against three different case groups namely CRC cases, high-risk and low-risk polyps. Results: The two investigated SNPs in XRCC1 were not found to be associated with neither CRC risk nor polyp risk. Comparing the CRC cases versus the controls the OR was 0.60 (95%CI 0.27\u20131.31) for the heterozygous polymorphic genotype of SNP rs1799782 and 1.47 (95%CI 0.81\u20132.65) for the homozygous polymorphic genotype of SNP rs25487.

Methods: Data were collected on all patients in major cities of Fars province who were diagnosed with cancer between 1998 and 2002. The data were computerized using SPSS (Chicago, IL) software, version 13.0, and MS EXCEL (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) software with Persian fonts. The results are presented as incidence rates of cases by site, sex, age, crude rates, and age-standardized rates per 100,000 person-years (ASRs), using the direct method of standardization to the world population. Results: During the 5-year study period, 8359 new cancer cases were registered. Diagnosis of cancer was based on histopathological criteria in 86.7%, clinical or radiological criteria in 9.4% and death certificate only in 3.9% of cases. According to the calculated ASRs, the 5 most frequent cancers in women were breast (13 per 100,000), stomach (4.4 per 100,000), lung and bronchus (2.9 per 100,000), uterus (2.7 per 100,000), and colon and rectum (2.6 per 100,000); and in men, the 5 most frequent types were stomach (9.2 per 100,000), bladder (6.8 per 100,000), lung and bronchus (6.3 per 100,000), lymphocytic leukemia (4.1 per 100,000), and skin melanoma (3.8 per 100,000). The ASR for all cancers in men was 64.5 per 100,000, and that for women was 55.5 per 100,000. Conclusion: Considering the limitations of this study, our results should be taken as the minimum incidence rates of cancers in Fars province, southern Iran. Significant differences were observed between the two study periods. However, we most likely have underestimated the frequencies of some tumors.",

     "abstract": "Background: Rates of distal and junctional adenocarcinomas are increasing in Western countries.Methods: Systematic review of epidemiological evidence linking obesity to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) was performed for studies published from 2005 to 2010. The current understanding of obesity's role in the etiology and potential dysplastic progression of Barrett's esophagus (BE) to EA is reviewed.Results: Accumulating epidemiological studies provide evidence of obesity's role as a driving force behind the increasing rates of EA. The simplest construct is that obesity promotes reflux, causing chronic inflammation and BE, predisposing to adenocarcinoma. However, as obesity is positively associated with the prevalence of many cancers, other mechanisms are important. A link may exist between fat distribution patterns and the risk of BE and EA. Altered metabolic profiles in the metabolic syndrome (MetS) may be a key factor in cell cycle/genetic abnormalities that mark the progression of BE towards cancer. Research highlighting a unique role of MetS in the length of BE, and its association with systemic inflammation and insulin resistance is discussed, as well as adipokine receptor expression in both BE and esophageal epithelium, and how MetS and the systemic response impacts on key regulators of inflammation and tumorigenesis.Conclusions/impact: Obesity is positively associated with EA. The systemic inflammatory state consequent on the altered metabolism of obese patients, and the associated impact of adipocytokines and pro-coagulant factors released by adipocytes in central fat, may underlie obesity's relationship to this cancer. Novel therapeutic agents that may antagonize adipo-cytokines and potentially offer a promising role in cancer therapy are discussed.",

Given that many risk factors may contribute to carcinogenesis, an etiological cause for the ethnic disparity remains to be defined. By analyzing the global prostate cancer incidence data, we found that distribution of prostate cancer incidence coincides with the migration and settlement history of Northern Europeans. The incidences in other ethnic groups correlate to the settlement history and extent of admixture of the Europeans.

Results: Over 97% of people reported seeing a doctor and 85% had lived in their current residence for over six years. The 2-year follow-up rate was 91% for Trivandrum and 53% for New Delhi. No cancer cases were missed among public institutions participating in the surveillance program in Trivandrum during 2003\u20132004; but there are likely to be unmatched cases (ranging from 5 to 13% of total cases) from private hospitals in the Trivandrum registry, as there are no mandatory reporting requirements.

Methods: We obtained the mortality data for 5-year age groups from the Vital Statistics of Japan for the years 1995 and 2005, an interval of 10 years. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) per 100,000 persons were calculated for each subset of oral cancer. We estimated YLL and AYLL according to life tables in Japan to reflect premature mortality. Results: For both men and women combined, 4099 and 5679 deaths due to oral cancer were recorded for the years 1995 and 2005. In men, cancer of tongue, oropharynx, and hypopharynx were the most frequently observed anatomic sites. We observed a total of 51,339.1 years of life lost in 1995 and 68,630.4 years in 2005, corresponding to an overall AYLL for all oral cancer deaths combined of 17.2 and 16.5 years earlier than life expectancy, respectively. The greatest AYLL was seen for deaths from nasopharyngeal cancer, with AYLL of 21.1 years in 1995 and 20.3 years in 2005. In women, cancer of the tongue and gum were the most affected anatomic sites. Total numbers of YLL were 18,884.8 years in 1995 and 24,765.7 in 2005, corresponding to an overall AYLL of 16.9 and 16.2 years earlier than life expectancy. The greatest AYLL was seen for deaths from nasopharyngeal cancer, with AYLL of 22.4 years and 20.4 years in 1995 and 2005, respectively.

We examined overall postmenopausal invasive breast cancer as well as tumor ER/PR subtypes. A bootstrap method provided estimates of 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs).The summary PARs (95%CIs) for non-modifiable risk factors (age at menarche, age at menopause, parity, benign breast disease, and family history of breast cancer) were 37.2% (27.1\u201347.2%) regarding overall invasive tumors, 36.5% (23.3\u201347.6%) regarding ER+/PR+ tumors, 47.9% (26.4\u201364.4%) regarding ER+/PR\u2212 tumors, and 31.1% (4.0\u201351.9%) regarding ER\u2212/PR\u2212 tumors. Of the modifiable risk factors (hormone therapy (HT) use, physical inactivity, BMI, alcohol consumption), HT use and physical inactivity had the highest impact with PARs of 19.4% (15.9\u201323.2%) and 12.8% (5.5\u201320.8%), respectively, regarding overall invasive tumors. For ER+/PR+ tumors, the corresponding PARs were 25.3% (20.9\u201329.7%) and 16.6% (7.0\u201326.0%). The summary PARs (95%CIs) for HT use and physical inactivity together were 29.8% (21.8\u201336.9%) and 37.9% (30.6\u201346.2%) regarding overall invasive and ER+/PR+ tumors, respectively.The population-level impact of modifiable risk factors appears to be comparable to that of non-modifiable risk factors.

Oxidative stress has been implicated in its pathogenesis; however, few prospective studies have investigated the association between an oxidative stress/balance score and risk of prostate cancer. Methods: We investigated associations between an oxidative balance score, calculated as the summation of individual scores obtained from five pro-oxidative and eight anti-oxidative exposures, as well as each individual constituent of the score and risks of prostate cancer overall, and by clinical characteristics, in a case-cohort study (661 cases and 1864 subcohort) nested within the Canadian Study of Diet, Lifestyle, and Health cohort. Men in the lowest quintiles of each pro-oxidant exposure received a score of four (the highest score), while those in the highest quintile received a score of zero (the lowest score). In contrast, scoring for all anti-oxidants was performed in the opposite way. Total oxidative balance score was calculated by summating all individual scores of pro- and anti-oxidative variables, with higher values indicating a higher antioxidant status. Results: The average oxidative balance score was similar between prostate cancer cases and men in the subcohort: 25.2 and 25.3, respectively. There was no association between oxidative balance score and overall risk of prostate cancer with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.00, 1.02, 1.03, 0.97 and 1.01 for increasing quintiles of the score (p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.71). There were also no associations for non-advanced or advanced disease, or when analysis was restricted to incident cases that arose after two years of follow-up (n\u00a0=\u00a0508). In general constituents of the score were not associated with prostate cancer, except for red meat intake (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.44; 95%CI 1.06\u20131.95 comparing Q5 vs. Q1) and lycopene (HRs of 0.7\u20130.8 for increasing quintiles). Conclusion: Our findings do not support an association between oxidative balance score and risks of overall prostate cancer or advanced disease.",

The present study examines the association between green tea drinking and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its interactions with other risk or protective factors and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of inflammation and oxidative stress related genes. Methods: A population-based case-control study with 204 primary HCC cases and 415 healthy controls was conducted in Taixing, China. Epidemiological data were collected using a standard questionnaire. SNPs of genes of the inflammation and metabolic pathways were genotyped at the UCLA Molecular Epidemiology Laboratory. Logistic regression was performed to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Longer duration and larger quantities of green tea consumption were inversely associated with primary HCC. Individuals who drank green tea longer than 30 years were at lowest risk (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.44, 95% CI: 0.19\u20130.96) compared with non-drinkers. A strong interaction was observed between green tea drinking and alcohol consumption (adjusted OR for interaction\u00a0=\u00a03.40, 95% CI: 1.26\u20139.16). Green tea drinking was also observed to have a potential effect modification on HBV/HCV infection, smoking and polymorphisms of inflammation related cytokines, especially for IL-10. Conclusion: Green tea consumption may protect against development of primary HCC. Potential effect modifications of green tea on associations between primary HCC and alcohol drinking, HBV/HCV infection, and inflammation-related SNPs were suggested.",

Smad7 protein is a known inhibitor of TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathway which has a prominent role in tumorigenesis. MGMT gene regulates the direct damage reversal repair pathway, preventing DNA damage and potential cancer development. This exploratory study aims to investigate the association between SMAD7 (rs4464148, rs4939827) and MGMT (rs12917, rs2308321) genotype variants, and all-cancer incidence. Methods: Our study population was a sub-cohort of the EPIC-Norfolk study, a prospective cohort of approximately 25,000 men and women aged 40\u201379. Between recruitment 1993\u20131997 and follow-up to 2006, 192 incident cases and 1155 non-cases with genotype data were identified. Baseline 7-day food diary and health/lifestyle questionnaire data were analysed. Results: SMAD7 rs4464148 variant genotype was associated with increased cancer incidence [HR\u00a0=\u00a01.34, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.00\u20131.80] but no overall association for SMAD7 rs4939827 or MGMT genotypes. Participants with variant genotypes in both SMAD7 SNPs had a higher cancer incidence compared to those without any (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.74, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.10\u20136.79) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03; Ptrend\u00a0=\u00a00.01).

Conclusions: These findings suggest that SMAD7 rs4464148 common variant genotype is associated with cancer incidence but not SMAD7 rs4939827, MGMT rs12917 or MGMT rs2308321. A combination of variants of the SMAD7 SNPs may be associated with increased cancer risk in this study population.

The participating women were residents of two adjacent administrative regions of Greece. Several performance indicators were calculated for the first and subsequent screen, separately.A total of 9621 mammograms were 1st screens and 4462 were subsequent screens. The attendance rate was almost 1.5%. The technical repeat rate was 1.7%. On the 1st screen, the recall rate was 11.4%, while the recall rate of the subsequent screens was 5.5%. The vast majority of detected cancers were invasive and only the 1/7 of cancers was identified as DCIS. As concerns tumour size of invasive cancers, the 1.9% and 16.7% was unknown, in the first and subsequent screen, respectively. Moreover, 38.5% and 44.4% of cancers detected in the 1st and subsequent screen, respectively, were less than 15\u00a0mm in diameter. Almost 1/5 of diagnosed cancers were interval cancers.This breast cancer screening programme is the first one in Greece and the attendance rate is extremely low. Taking into account that an organised screening programme may benefit women with a reduction in breast cancer mortality, there is an urgent need to develop a national-based screening programme, to increase participation and to improve the information system used to monitor programme performance.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) are clonal stem cell disorders characterized by cytopenias, dysplasia in one or more cell lineages and ineffective hematopoiesis and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to bone marrow failure or evolution to acute myeloid leukemia. Clonal chromosomal abnormalities are detected in 40\u201360% of patients. Multiple recurrent chromosomal aberrations have been identified by cytogenetics including fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) which is now widely recognized as one of the most important diagnostic and prognostic markers in MDS. Methods: Conventional cytogenetics by GTG-banding, FISH, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was done on 40 primary MDS subjects. Results: Among 40 subjects, 10 (25%) were abnormal and 30 (75%) showed apparently normal karyotypes with GTG banding and FISH. The various aberrations observed were del 5q\u2212, del 7q\u2212, 20q\u2212, +8. DNA copy number changes including losses (30%) and gains (20%) were detected by CGH in 11 (36.6%) out of 30 karyotypically normal MDS. However chromosome 7 (37%) and 1 (25%) is frequently involved in current study population. Conclusions: This study confirms that the apart from non-random chromosome aberrations, other chromosome regions also involved in the MDS development. The occupational, environmental and geographical variations might be influencing the disease. Furthermore cytogenetic studies are warranted in larger groups of MDS cases to identify newly acquired chromosome aberrations that may aid in cloning new genes involved in the neoplastic process, ultimately helping in the development of targeted therapeutic drugs.",

     "abstract": "Background: Prospective studies support that statins may protect against advanced prostate cancer. Detection bias arising from higher PSA screening rates among statin users vs. non-users could produce an inverse association for advanced disease. Thus, we conducted simulations to assess whether this source of bias is explanatory. Methods: 3000 datasets with 100,000 men without prostate cancer were simulated for populations with high (65%) or low (15%) PSA screening. We investigated three scenarios: RRtrue\u00a0=\u00a01.0, 0.75, and 0.5 for statins and advanced disease (1.0 for localized). We set the statin prevalence to 10% and varied the percentage of users who were PSA screened (0\u2013100%). We assumed an annual total prostate cancer incidence of 1%, with risk in screened men twice that of unscreened men, and an advanced stage at diagnosis in 20% and 40% of cases in screened and unscreened men, respectively. Results: As PSA screening and statin use became more coincident, the RRobserved for local and total prostate cancer was biased upward from the RRtrue of 1.0, especially when the prevalence of PSA screening was low. However, in all simulated scenarios, there was little downward bias for advanced disease (e.g., if RRtrue\u00a0=\u00a01.0 and 70% of statin users and either 65% or 15% of the population overall was PSA screened, then RRobserved\u00a0=\u00a00.98 for both). Conclusions: Given our assumptions, this simulation suggests that this source of detection bias is unlikely to explain the reported inverse association between statins and advanced prostate cancer, but may explain the positive association for total prostate cancer that has been reported in some studies.",

We investigated the association between the Cyclin D1 A870G polymorphism and susceptibility to salivary gland tumors (SGTs) by PCR-RFLP in 102 Chinese SGT patients and 101 healthy controls. The frequencies of the AG (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; odds ratio (OR), 3.466) and AA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003; OR, 3.133) genotypes of Cyclin D1 were significantly higher in patients with SGT than in the healthy controls. The frequencies of these two genotypes were also significantly higher in pleomorphic adenoma (PA) patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; OR, 2.229), compared with the healthy controls. In addition, the expression of Cyclin D1 was found to be significantly higher in PA patients with the AA genotype, compared with PA patients with the GG genotype. Taken together, our results suggested that the Cyclin D1 A870G polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of SGTs in the Chinese population. The Cyclin D1 AA genotype not only increased the risk of PA, but also increased the expression of Cyclin D1 in this type of tumor.",

Methods: We evaluated differences between HFPC and sporadic cancers, in the pattern of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms in CYP17A1, CYP19A1, VDR genes, and the CAG repeat from AR, controlling for dietary intake and lifestyle habits in a regionwide population. Ninety-five patients with HFPC were identified and 378 sporadic prostate cancers were randomly selected as controls. Dietary intake and lifestyle habits were determined through self-administered questionnaires in all patients. Genotyping of polymorphisms for CYP17A1, CYP19A1, VDR, and the CAG repeat from AR was carried out using pyrosequencing. Results: HFPC cases were significantly younger than controls, whereas similar proportions of localized tumours, favourable histology, and abnormal prostate serum antigen levels (4\u201319\u00a0ng/ml) were detected in the two groups.

     "abstract": "Introduction: Breast cancer in women has historically been seen as a \u201ccancer of affluence\u201d and there is a well-documented higher incidence among women of higher social class, as well as in societies with higher resources. However, the relationship between social class and breast cancer disease characteristics, especially those associated with poorer prognosis, is less well documented, and the overall relationship between breast cancer mortality and social class has been shown to vary. Furthermore, rapid changes in women's health and health-related behaviors in societies around the world may have an impact on both incidence and mortality patterns for breast cancer in the future. Methods: A PUBMED search on breast cancer and social class (incorporating the MeSH-nested concept of SES) yielded 403 possible studies published between 1978 and 2009, of which 90 met criteria for review. Our review discusses conceptualization and measurement of women's social class in each study, as well as findings related to breast cancer incidence, tumor biology or mortality, associated with social class. Findings: We found mostly consistent evidence that breast cancer incidence continues to be higher in higher social class groups, with some modification of risk with adjustment for known risk factors, including physical activity and reproductive history. However, biologic characteristics associated with poorer prognosis were negatively associated with social class (i.e., greater occurrence among disadvantaged women), and mortality from breast cancer showed inconsistent relationship to social class. Conclusions: We discuss these studies in relation to the growing burden of breast cancer among low resource groups and countries, and the need for cancer control strategies reflecting the emerging demographics of breast cancer risk.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: This study aimed at modelling the effect of organized breast cancer screening on mortality in France. It combined results from a Markov model for breast cancer progression, to predict number of cases by node status, and from relative survival analyses, to predict deaths. The method estimated the relative risk of mortality at 8 years, in women aged 50\u201369, between a population screened every two years and a reference population. Methods: Analyses concerned cases diagnosed between 1990 and 1996, with a follow-up up to 2004 for the vital status. Markov models analysed data from 3 screening programs (300,000 mammographies) and took into account opportunistic screening among participants to avoid bias in parameter's estimates. We used survival data from cancers in the general population (n\u00a0=\u00a0918, 7 cancer registries) and from screened cancers (n\u00a0=\u00a0565, 3 cancer registries), after excluding a subgroup of screened cases with a particularly high survival. Sensitivity analyses were performed. Results: Markov model main analysis lacked of fit in two out of three districts. Fit was improved in stratified analyses by age or district, though some lack of fit persisted in two districts. Assuming 10% or 20% overdiagnosed screened cancers, mortality reduction was estimated as 23% (95% CI: 4, 38%) and 19% (CI: \u22123, 35%) respectively. Results were highly sensitive to the exclusion in the screened cancers survival analysis. Conversely, RR estimates varied moderately according to the Markov model parameters used (stratified by age or district). Conclusion: The study aimed at estimating the effect of screening in a screened population compared to an unscreened control group. Such a control group does not exist in France, and we used a general population contaminated by opportunistic screening to provide a conservative estimate. Conservative choices were systematically adopted to avoid favourable estimates. A selection bias might however affect the estimates, though it should be moderate because extreme social classes are under-represented among participants. This modelling provided broad estimates for the effect of organized biennial screening in France in the early nineteen-nineties. Results will be strengthened with longer follow-up.",

The aims of this work were to study the reliability of uterine cancer recordings in death certificates using a case matching with cancer registries and estimate age-specific proportions of deaths from cervix and corpus uteri cancers among all uterine cancer deaths by a statistical approach that uses incidence and survival data. Deaths from uterine cancer between 1989 and 2001 were extracted from the French National database of causes of death and case-to-case matched to women diagnosed with uterine cancer between 1989 and 1997 in 8 cancer registries. Registry data were considered as \u201cgold-standard\u201d. Among the 1825 matched deaths, cancer registries recorded 830 cervix and 995 corpus uteri cancers. In death certificates, 5% and 40% of \u201ctrue\u201d cervix cancers were respectively coded \u201ccorpus\u201d and \u201cuterus, NOS\u201d and 5% and 59% of \u201ctrue\u201d corpus cancers respectively coded \u201ccervix\u201d and \u201cuterus, NOS\u201d. Miscoding cervix cancers was more frequent at advanced ages at death and in deaths at home or in small urban areas. Miscoding corpus cancers was more frequent in deaths at home or in small urban areas. From the statistical method, the estimated proportion of deaths from cervix cancer among all uterine cancer deaths was higher than 95% in women aged 30\u201340 years old but declined to 35% in women older than 70 years. The study clarifies the reason for poor encoding of uterus cancer mortality and refines the estimation of mortalities from cervix and corpus uteri cancers allowing future studies on the efficacy of cervical cancer screening.",

Sensitivity and positive predictive value of total self-reported cancer diagnoses were 53% and 60%, respectively, but varied by site, at 62% and 52% for stomach, 38% and 47% for colorectum, 57% and 46% for lung, 34% and 31% for liver, 82% and 58% for breast, and 59% and 22% for uterus, respectively. Sensitivity was considerably improved from that in the previous report (36%), which tested for 1990\u20131995, but was still not considered satisfactory. Self-reported diagnoses of cancer do not provide sufficient accuracy for the detection and classification of incident cancers. Our findings may be extrapolated to other Japanese populations.",

     "abstract": "Background: We investigated the variation in cancer incidence in Gharbiah, Egypt to explore geographic differences in relation to demographic and environmental exposures. Methods: Using data from the only population-based cancer registry of Gharbiah, we studied the 10 most common cancers in men and women over 4 years (1999\u20132002). Census data provided denominators and urban\u2013rural definitions. Crude and adjusted incidence rates (IRs), incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Poisson regression. Results: Incidence of all common cancers was higher among men than women and urban incidence was higher than rural incidence for all cancer sites. Among men and women urban\u2013rural incidence difference was highest for prostate cancer (IRR\u00a0=\u00a04.85, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a03.76, 6.26) and uterus (IRR\u00a0=\u00a06.05, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a04.17, 8.78), respectively. Among men and women, El-Santa district had the highest urban\u2013rural difference within districts for laryngeal cancer (IRR\u00a0=\u00a029.45, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a010.63, 81.61) and uterine cancer (IRR\u00a0=\u00a015.98, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.69, 95.10), respectively. El-Santa also showed the highest urban incidence among all eight districts for most cancer sites.

     "abstract": "Background: The tumor suppressor gene SMAD4 (DPC4) encodes for the common intracellular mediator of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily pathway, which regulates numerous cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, cell fate and migration. This study was aimed to investigate the presence of genetic variants in SMAD4 gene promoter in malignant pancreatic and colorectal tissue and to analyze their functional consequences. Methods: The study was performed on genomic DNA isolated from malignant tissue samples obtained on surgery from 50 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and 50 patients with colorectal cancer. Screening for mutations within an 800\u00a0bp-long fragment of the SMAD4 gene promoter was performed by DNA sequencing and two mononucleotide repeats, at positions \u2212462 and \u22124, were found to be polymorphic in malignant tissue. The exact number of thymidines in the tracts \u2212462T(15) and \u22124T(12) was determined by PCR with fluorescently labeled primers followed by capillary electrophoresis. Functional analysis of \u2212462T(15)/\u22124T(12) haplotypes was performed by luciferase reporter assays. Results: Haplotype \u2212462T(14)/\u22124T(10) was found in 85% of pancreatic cancer tissues, but it was not present in any of colorectal cancer tissues. Statistically significant reduction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in activity was observed in the haplotype \u2212462T(14)/\u22124T(10) in comparison with the haplotypes \u2212462T(15)/\u22124T(12) and \u2212462T(14)/\u22124T(11). Conclusion: Results of this study indicate that novel genetic variant \u22124T(10) in the SMAD4 gene promoter affects its activity and that element \u22124T(12) may play a role in transcriptional regulation of SMAD4 gene expression. Obtained results, though preliminary, also indicate that SMAD4 gene promoter haplotype \u2212462T(14)/\u22124T(10) may represent a genetic marker of potential relevance for pancreatic and colorectal cancer. The findings of this study should be confirmed by further investigation in these two and other tumors, on larger number of patients and with different tumor stages. Translational research aimed at investigating potential application of mononucleotide repeats \u2212462T(15) and \u22124T(12) in SMAD4 gene promoter as molecular markers in cancer may also prove useful.",

     "abstract": "Background: The multistep process of carcinogenesis is characterized by progressive disorganization and occurrence of initiation, promotion, and progression events. Several new strategies such as chemoprevention are being developed for treatment and prevention at various stages of carcinogenesis. Sulforaphane, a potential chemopreventive agent, possesses anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities and has attracted extensive interest for better cancer management. Methods: We evaluated the effect of sulforaphane alone or in combination with gemcitabine on HeLa cells by cell viability assay and confirmed the results by apoptosis assay. Further we analyzed the effect of sulforaphane on the expression of Bcl-2, COX-2 and IL-1\u03b2 by RT-PCR on HeLa cells. Results: In the present study, sulforaphane was found to induce dose-dependent selective cytotoxicity in HeLa cells in comparison to normal cells pointing to its safe cytotoxicity profile. Additionally, a combination of sulforaphane and gemcitabine was found to increase the growth inhibition in a synergistic manner in HeLa cells compared to the individual drugs. Also, the expression analysis of genes involved in apoptosis and inflammation revealed significant downregulation of Bcl-2, COX-2 and IL-1\u03b2 upon treatment with sulforaphane. Conclusion: Our results suggest that sulforaphane exerts its anticancer activities via apoptosis induction and anti-inflammatory properties and provides the first evidence demonstrating synergism between sulforaphane and gemcitabine which may enhance the therapeutic index of prevention and/or treatment of cervical cancer.",

     "abstract": "Purpose: The aims of this study were to evaluate the relationship between SLC22A18 expression and clinicopathologic features while investigate the prognostic value of SLC22A18 expression in breast cancer after surgery. Specimens and methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to examine SLC22A18 protein expression in the breast tumors. Prognostic value of SLC22A18 protein and other clinicopathologic factors were evaluated. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to predict factors with a significant independent prognostic value. Digital image analysis was employed to quantify immunostaining. Results: SLC22A18 expression was correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, and extensive lyphovascular invasion. The results of Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis indicated that SLC22A18 expression was associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) of breast cancer. The survival of higher expression SLC22A18 group had longer cum survival compared to the group with low expression. The difference was significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, log-rank test). Cox's regression analysis showed that tumor size, lymph nodes metastasis, nuclear stage, extensive lymphovascular invasion, and SLC22A18 expression might be used as prognostic factor for RFS. Nuclear stage and SLC22A18 expression were the most meaningful histopathologic parameter in predicting tumor recurrence. Compared with the group of higher SLC22A18 expression, the lower expression group was more likely to relapse. The HR is 2.624 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035). Conclusion: Low expression of SLC22A18 was associated with tumor progression, recurrence and poor survival after breast surgery. Testing expression of SLC22A18 will be helpful for predicting prognosis in breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effect of the Quality assured Mamma Diagnostic programme (QuaMaDi) introduced in 2001 on breast cancer and mortality on a population basis. QuaMaDi provides a standardized diagnostic process for symptomatic or at risk women of all ages. The process includes independent double-reading of mammograms, additional ultrasound, and if suspicious an expert reading and assessment. We tested the hypothesis that QuaMaDi has influenced breast cancer epidemiology and survival positively. Methods: The QuaMaDi cohort of breast cancer patients, diagnosed within the programme between 2001 and 2007, was linked to the cancer registry dataset of all breast cancer cases in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. By this record-linkage procedure participants of QuaMaDi could be marked in the cancer registry data. Overall survival rates of 3096 patients diagnosed within QuaMaDi were compared to 5417 patients diagnosed outside QuaMaDi, matched by year of diagnosis, using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Crude hazard ratio for overall survival was HR 0.43 (95% CI 0.35\u20130.52) for breast cancer cases detected inside QuaMaDi versus those diagnosed outside the programme. After stepwise adjustment for age, grading, histology, treatment, and tumour stage, the survival advantage in QuaMaDi diagnosed breast cancer patients was still statistically significant (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64\u20130.96). Conclusion: Evidence is provided that the QuaMaDi programme has a beneficial impact on the first 5-year overall survival rate after breast cancer beyond a favourable tumour stage distribution. Thus, we conclude that QuaMaDi contributes to improved health care for women, who are not eligible for mammography screening.",

     "abstract": "Background: Reading volume and mammography screening performance appear positively correlated. Quality and effectiveness were compared across low-volume screening programmes targeting relatively small populations and operating under the same decentralised healthcare system. Except for accreditation of 2nd readers (restrictive vs non-restrictive strategy), these organised programmes had similar screening regimen/procedures and duration, which maximises comparability. Variation in performance and its determinants were explored in order to improve mammography practice and optimise screening performance. Methods: Circa 200,000 screens performed between 1999 and 2006 (4 rounds) in 3 longest standing Swiss cantonal programmes (of Vaud, Geneva and Valais) were assessed. Indicators of quality and effectiveness were assessed according to European standards. Interval cancers were identified through linkage with cancer registries records. Results: Swiss programmes met most European standards of performance with a substantial, favourable cancer stage shift. Up to a two-fold variation occurred for several performance indicators. In subsequent rounds, compared with programmes (Vaud and Geneva) that applied a restrictive selection strategy for 2nd readers, proportions of in situ lesions and of small cancers (\u22641\u00a0cm) were one third lower and halved, respectively, and the proportion of advanced lesions (stage II+) nearly 50% higher in the programme without a restrictive selection strategy. Discrepancy in second-year proportional incidence of interval cancers appears to be multicausal. Conclusion: Differences in performance could partly be explained by a selective strategy for second readers and a prior experience in service screening, but not by the levels of opportunistic screening and programme attendance. This study provides clues for enhancing mammography screening performance in low-volume programmes.",

     "abstract": "Purpose: Cancer in a child may adversely affect parents\u2019 work opportunities due to enlarged care burdens and/or altered priorities. Few studies exist, and possible effects on parental employment and earnings were therefore explored. Materials and methods: Data on the entire Norwegian population aged 27\u201365 with children under the age of 20 in 1990\u20132002 (N\u00a0=\u00a01.2 million) was retrieved from national registries. Employment rates for parents of 3263 children with cancer were compared to those of parents with children without cancer by means of logistic regression models. Log-linear regression models were used to explore childhood cancer's effect on parental earnings for the large majority of parents who remained employed. Results: Cancer in a child was in general not associated with a reduced risk of employment, although some exceptions exist among both mothers and fathers. For employed mothers, CNS cancers, germinal cell cancers, and unspecified leukemia were associated with significant reductions in earnings (10%, 21%, and 60%, respectively). Reductions were particularly pronounced for mothers with a young and alive child, and became more pronounced with time elapsed from diagnosis. Fathers\u2019 earnings were not affected significantly. Discussion and conclusion: Parents\u2019 employment is not adversely affected by a child's cancer in Norway. Earnings are reduced in certain instances, but the overall effects are minor. Generous welfare options and flexible labor markets typical for Nordic welfare states may account for this. In line with traditional caregiving responsibilities, reductions in earnings were most pronounced for mothers.",

     "abstract": "Objective: To examine the risk of subsequent primary ovarian cancer among women diagnosed previously with cancer (subsequent cohort) and to compare demographic and tumor characteristics affecting overall survival of these women and women diagnosed with first primary ovarian cancer (index cohort). Methods: We identified the two cohorts of women using the 1973\u20132005 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) result data. We calculated relative risk of subsequent primary ovarian cancer and estimated 5-year risks of dying (hazard-ratios) after diagnosis of the first or subsequent primary ovarian cancer in the two cohorts, respectively using Cox modeling. Results: Women diagnosed with index cancers of the corpus uteri, colon, cervix, and melanoma at age younger than 50 had increased risk of ovarian cancer within 5 years after diagnosis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05); young breast cancer survivors had continued risk beyond 20 years. In 5-year follow-up survival analysis, the factors associated with a better survival (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were similar in both cohorts and included more recent diagnosis; localized or regional disease; age <50 years at diagnosis; and being white versus black. A lower risk of dying from mucinous, endometrioid, or non-epithelial tumors than from serous was seen after 15 months (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), or after 32 months from diagnosis of the index and subsequent cohorts, respectively. Conclusions: Age, stage, and histology affect ovarian cancer survival. The increased risk of ovarian cancer over time, especially among breast and colon cancer survivors who are less than 50 years of age, suggests common etiologies and necessitates careful surveillance by health care providers and increased survivors awareness through educational efforts.",

Results are assessed with respect to secular trends in smoking habits. Methods: MAD and MADLC were computed by year and gender as the expected value of a fitted Weibull distribution. Age-period-cohort effects on lung cancer death rates were estimated by hierarchical Poisson models. Results: In females MADLC was on average about 2 years higher than in males and tended to decrease since the mid 1980s, while after the mid 1990s MADLC in males increased such that the difference between men and women shrank to about half a year in 2007. Females dying from lung cancer lost about 6 years of life during the late 1970s but more than 10 years after 2000, while males lost 2 years in the 1970s and 5 years after 2000. Males demonstrated a decreasing risk with increasing year of birth, with the exception of cohorts born during or immediately after the World Wars that showed peak relative risks (RR). Females did not show pronounced birth cohort effect except for a peak RR for cohorts born during and after World War II. Conclusions: MADLC provides additional information about secular trends in addition to incidence data. The declining trend of MADLC in females and in males up to the mid 1990s points to a change of smoking habits with an earlier onset of smoking in both genders. The subsequent increase in males during the last decade may be attributed to an increasing proportion of quitters because smoking cessation delays onset of lung cancer.",

Previous studies of such concordance are outdated. Objective: To characterize the accuracy of cancer mortality statistics from the concordance between cancer cause of death and primary cancer site at diagnosis. Design: Central cancer registry records from California, Colorado, and Idaho in the U.S. were linked with state vital statistics data and evaluated by demographic and tumor information across 79 site categories. A retrospective arm (confirmation rate per 100 deaths) compared death certificate data from 2002 to 2004 with cancer registry diagnoses from 1993 to 2004, while a prospective arm (detection rate per 100 deaths) compared cancer registry diagnoses from 1993 to 1995 with death certificate data from 1993 to 2004 by International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) version used to code deaths. Results: With n\u00a0=\u00a0265,863 deaths where cancer was recorded as the underlying cause based on the death certificate, the overall confirmation rate for ICD-10 was 82.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 82.6\u201383.0%), the overall detection rate for ICD-10 was 81.0% (95% CI, 80.4\u201381.6%), and the overall detection rate for ICD-9 was 85.0% (95% CI, 84.8\u201385.2%). These rates varied across primary sites, where some rates were <50%, some were 95% or greater, and notable differences between confirmation and detection rates were observed. Conclusions: Important unique information on the quality of cancer mortality data obtained from death certificates is provided. In addition, information is provided for future studies of the concordance of primary cancer site between population-based cancer registry data and data from death certificates, particularly underlying causes of death coded in ICD-10.",

     "abstract": "Objective: This study provides an assessment of completeness of cancer surveillance and incidence estimates for all malignancies, Hodgkin's lymphoma and thyroid cancer in the Italian army, for the years 2001\u20132007. Methods: The two-source capture\u2013recapture method was employed, using both Chapman's and Chao's formulae, on the basis of cancer notifications from military hospitals and unit infirmaries. The estimated incident cases were then confronted with the corresponding expected cases; the standardized incidence ratios and 95% confidence intervals (SIR [95% CI]) were then calculated. Results: A total of 442 cancer notifications, concerning 371 cases, were reported (311 from army hospitals and 131 from unit infirmaries; of these, 71 were overlapping). The estimated total number of cases, by Chapman's and Chao's formulae, was 571 and 688, respectively. Overall, sensitivity of the surveillance system was 65% by Chapman's and 54% by Chao's estimators. Completeness of notification was significantly higher in younger patients, in those previously deployed in Bosnia or Kosovo, and for cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma. Estimated SIRs, using both formulae, were not significant for all malignancies and Hodgkin's lymphoma, but significant for thyroid cancer (SIR: 2.25 [1.61\u20132.89] by Chapman's formula, and 3.12 [1.81\u20134.43] by Chao's estimator). Conclusion: Completeness of cancer registry of the Italian military is low, and methods to improve its sensitivity are discussed. Overall, the estimated number of incident cancer cases, including Hodgkin's lymphoma, is not significantly higher than expected, except thyroid cancer. The increased incidence of this malignancy requires further investigation; however, in the military, as well as in the general population, this may be partly due to the growing availability of diagnostic opportunities in the last decades. Moreover, detection of thyroid cancer may be further facilitated by a selection bias generated by the annual and pre-/post-deployment medical examinations and blood tests routinely performed on all military personnel.",

A marked excess of infectious illness episodes was recorded for HL cases compared to their controls; evident at least a decade prior to HL diagnosis. For non-infectious consultations an excess of case over control visits emerged 4\u20136 years before DLBCL and FL diagnosis; no specific co-morbidity associations were found. No case\u2013control differences for non-infectious conditions were apparent for HL. Conclusion: There are substantial variations in patterns of illness prior to diagnosis of the three lymphoma subtypes examined. The excess of infectious diagnoses prior to HL may point to underlying immune abnormality, but there was no suggestion of this for DLBCL and FL where a generalized excess of non-infectious conditions was evident.",

Methods: Incident cases of cancer of the lung (n\u00a0=\u00a0857), colon (n\u00a0=\u00a0496), bladder (n\u00a0=\u00a0484), prostate (n\u00a0=\u00a0449), stomach (n\u00a0=\u00a0251), rectum (n\u00a0=\u00a0248), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n\u00a0=\u00a0215), kidney (n\u00a0=\u00a0177), pancreas (n\u00a0=\u00a0116), melanoma (n\u00a0=\u00a0103), esophagus (n\u00a0=\u00a099), Hodgkin's lymphoma (n\u00a0=\u00a054), and 533 population controls, were interviewed. Detailed lifetime occupational PAs were translated into metabolic equivalents. Participation in sports and outdoor activities was elicited. Results: Compared to those with low lifetime occupational PA levels, men with high occupational PA levels had decreased odds ratios (OR) for all cancer types. The strongest evidence was for cancers of the colon [OR: 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.34\u20130.99] and the prostate (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31\u20130.95). Men engaging in sports and outdoor activities had lower risks of lung (OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52\u20130.91), esophageal (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.30\u20130.97) and bladder (OR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.59\u20131.05) cancers, and somewhat increased risks of melanoma (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 0.73\u20132.12). Conclusions: A protective effect of high lifetime occupational PA levels was observed for colon and prostate cancers. A tendency for inverse associations was also noted for several other cancer types. Recreational PA was inversely related with smoking-related cancers including lung, esophageal and bladder cancers.",

High sensitivity of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) test for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) makes it a useful screening tool, especially in settings where cytology is not available or not quality assured. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of hrHPV and associated cervical lesions in Russian women over 30 years of age and to assess usefulness of HPV test for cervical screening in Russia. Methods: Consecutive women aged 30\u201365 years (n\u00a0=\u00a0823) receiving routine gynaecological care, not pregnant and not treated for high-grade CIN, were recruited. Oncogenic HPV types were detected using Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) assay and genotyped with direct DNA sequencing. Women with cytological abnormalities higher than atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and women positive for hrHPV were referred to colposcopy. Results: HPV infection was present in 107 (13%) women. Cytological abnormalities were found in 81 (9.8%) patients, including 59 (7.2%) with ASCUS, 21 (2.5%) with low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL), and one (0.1%) with high-grade SIL. Only 11 (18.6%) patients with ASCUS were positive for hrHPV. Histological diagnoses were obtained for 63 women. Relative sensitivities and positive predictive values of the HPV test and cytology for the detection of high-grade CIN were 100% (6/6) and 9.5% (6/63), and 83.3% (5/6) and 27.8% (5/18), respectively. The most prevalent hrHPV types were 16 (3.9%), 31 (2.8%), 52 (1.7%), and 33 (1.3%). Cytological abnormalities and symptoms of a urogenital infection were strongly associated with hrHPV infection. Conclusions: The study provides data on the prevalence of hrHPV types in association with cervical lesions, as well as on hrHPV determinants, in an unvaccinated population of Russian women.

     "abstract": "Introduction: Today, the causal relationship between inflammation and gastric cancer is more widely accepted. Genetic variations in inflammation-related genes especially cytokines and their receptors, were thought to partly determine the outcome of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and progression of gastric lesions. Interleukin 23 receptor (IL23R), as a key cytokine receptor gene in the important inflammatory IL-17/IL-23 axis, may contribute to gastric cancer predisposition. Up till now, the associations of IL23R gene polymorphisms with subtypes of gastric cancer are largely unknown. Aims: We investigated whether the association between IL23R +2199 rs10889677 and gastric cancer risk varies by clinical characteristics and the prognostic value of the polymorphism in a case\u2013control study. Methods: A population-based case\u2013control study was conducted in Guangdong. 1010 gastric cancer patients and 800 healthy controls were enrolled. Polymorphism in IL23R was analyzed by PCR-RFLP. Results: Compared with AA, CC carriers of IL23R +2199 polymorphism were associated with protection against gastric cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.47, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.31\u20130.71). In stratified analyses, CC genotype was significantly associated with decreased risk of intestinal type (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.44, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.27\u20130.70), but not with diffuse or mix type of gastric cancer. CC genotype was found to be associated with poorly differentiated (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.43, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.26\u20130.70), but not with moderately or well differentiated gastric cancer. Multivariate analysis showed IL23R +2199A/C variant was not an independent prognostic factor for gastric cancer patients. Conclusion: IL23R polymorphism influences certain subtypes of gastric cancer according to clinical and pathological features. Understanding the etiologic heterogeneity of gastric cancer may result in improvements in controlling this disorder.",

     "abstract": "Background: DNA repair gene polymorphisms can contribute to susceptibility of human cancer, including gastric cancer. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of xeroderma pigmentosum group D (XPD) and X-ray repair cross complement 1 (XRCC1) genes were genotyped in gastric cancer and control subjects in a population from Southwestern China for their association with susceptibility of gastric cancer risk. Methods: 190 hospital-based cases and 180 matched controls were recruited and blood samples were collected from each of them and amplified with a PCR and DNA sequenced for XPD Asp312Asn, XRCC1 Arg194Trp, and XRCC1 Arg280Gln genotyping. Results: Allelic association analysis of these three SNPs showed that the frequency of XRCC1 194Trp in gastric cancer case and the control was 17.2% and 7.3%, respectively, which was significantly associated with gastric cancer risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.72, 95% CI: 1.04\u20137.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027). Furthermore, XRCC1 194Trp allele increased gastric carcinoma risk in male patients with older age and distant metastasis of gastric cancer. In addition, XRCC1 Trp allele but not XRCC1 Arg allele was closely associated to development of gastric cardia carcinoma. However, other SNPs did not show an association with gastric cancer risk or other clinicopathologic data of the patients. Conclusion: XRCC1 194Trp allele significantly increased the risk of gastric cancer and also associated with risk of gastric cardia carcinoma and promoted distant metastasis of gastric cancer. Future study will verify these findings for use of this SNP as biomarker in gastric cancer.",

     "abstract": "Background: The formation of bulky DNA adducts caused by diol epoxide derivatives of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has been associated with tobacco-induced cancers, and inefficient repair of such adducts by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) system has been linked to increased risk of tobacco-induced lung and head and neck (H&N) cancers. The human excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) protein is essential for a functional NER system and genetic variation in ERCC1 may contribute to impaired DNA repair capacity and increased lung and H&N cancer risk. Methods: In order to comprehensively capture common genetic variation in the ERCC1 gene, Caucasian data from the International HapMap project was used to assess linkage disequilibrium and choose four tagSNPs (rs1319052, rs3212955, rs3212948, and rs735482) in the ERCC1 gene to genotype 452 lung cancer cases, 175 H&N cancer cases, and 790 healthy controls. Haplotypes were estimated using expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, and haplotype association with cancer was investigated using Haplo.stats software adjusting for known covariates. Results: The genotype and haplotype frequencies matched previous estimates from Caucasians. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of rs1319052, rs3212955, rs3212948, and rs735482 when comparing lung or H&N cancer cases with controls (p-values\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Similarly, there was no association between ERCC1 haplotypes and lung or H&N cancer susceptibility in this Caucasian population (p-values\u00a0>\u00a00.05). No associations were found when stratifying lung cancer cases by histology, sex, smoking status, or smoking intensity.

Based on a hospital based case\u2013control study, the epidemiological questionnaires were completed by face to face interview, and the gene polymorphisms were tested by RFLP\u2013PCR, and serum trace metals were measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer, and the data was analyzed by the logistic regressive models. Results: The high serum copper level (>1500\u00a0ng/ml) or serum copper/zinc ratio (>1) was the risk factors of NSCLC (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.10, 11.03, respectively), but the ORs of the higher serum Zn (>1200\u00a0ng/ml), Se (>50\u00a0ng/ml) or Cr3+ (>600\u00a0ng/ml) for NSCLC were all significantly less than 0.20 (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) indicating strong protection against NSCLC. While the OR of CYP 1A1 variants carriers with a higher serum Cu or Cu/Zn ratio level was around 3.38 and 12.59, respectively, the risk of CYP1A1 variants carriers with a higher serum Zn is 0.18, Se 0.04 or Cr3+ 0.28. Similarly, compared with the carriers of GSTM1 power with a lower serum Zn, Se or Cr3+, the OR of the carriers of GSTM1 null with a higher serum Zn, Se and Cr3+ was separately 0.16, 0.07 and 0.26, highlighting the protection against NSCLC.

     "abstract": "Background: While use of mammography is limited, due to concerns related to radiation exposure, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), commonly available in medical care settings, is characterized by low radiation exposure. Methods: In the current paper, we compared breast density measured by DXA with mammographic density in 101 adult women who had a screening mammogram during the last 2 years. DXA scans of both breasts were taken using a clinical DXA system calibrated to measure breast density. The total projected breast area was manually delineated on each image and percent fibroglandular volume density (%FGV), absolute fibroglandular volume, total breast area and volume were computed. After digitizing mammographic films, total breast area, dense area, and percent density (PD) were estimated using computer-assisted mammographic density assessment. Results: Both DXA and mammographic measures showed high correlations between left and right breasts ranging from 0.85 to 0.98 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Mean %FGV was 38.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.3%, and mean percent density was 31.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.2% for craniocaudal views and 28.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.2% for mediolateral views. The correlation between the two measures was 0.76 for both views (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Associations with common risk factors showed similar patterns for DXA and mammographic densities; in particular, the inverse associations with BMI and age at menarche were evident for both methods. Multilinear regression with stepwise selection indicated an explained variance of 0.56 for %FGV alone and of 0.58 for %FGV plus number of children. Conclusion: Despite some differences in methodology, the current comparison suggests that DXA may provide a low-radiation option in evaluating breast density.",

Specifically, this study focuses on the different patterns in the structural model of HRQOL by ethnic and language groups. Methods: Secondary data derived from 560 European- and Latina-American cervical cancer survivors was used. The study methodology was guided by the Contextual Model of health-related quality of life. Results: Structural equation modeling demonstrated significant differences in the overall structural models for HRQOL by ethnicity. For example, European-Americans showed significant association between radiation therapy and HRQOL, while life burden was related to sexual impact for Latina-Americans only. The results showed the significant mediating effects of general health status and psychological well-being between patient\u2013doctor relationship and HRQOL, and between life burden and HRQOL, respectively, for all ethnic and language groups. While language group differences (limited English vs. English proficient) among Latina-Americans emerged in bivariate analyses; these distinctions were not upheld in the overall structural models. Conclusion: The unique contribution of the individual- and systemic-level components in predicting overall HRQOL outcome seems to vary by ethnic group membership. Our findings advance our understanding of the predictors and the association among the predictors of HRQOL. This study may contribute to the evolution of culturally and linguistically responsive HRQOL conceptual frameworks and instrumentation for vulnerable populations.",

     "abstract": "The aims: The aims of this Finnish total cohort survey were to compare the health related quality of life (HRQL) of childhood cancer survivors with for age, gender and place of residence matched controls, to analyse whether the disease-related factors do explain the survivors scores, and to evaluate the similarity of HRQL scores gained with two different generic instruments. Methods: Questionnaires (SF-36 version 2 and the 15D) were mailed to 468 survivors and their controls. Results: A total of 271 survivors and 329 controls replied. The survivors rated with both instruments their HRQL in most areas as high or higher than their controls. Mobility score was, however, significantly lower for survivors than controls. Females rated their HRQL lower than respective males. Self-rated happiness had the highest effect in explaining the variation of 15D and mental component summary (MCS) scores. Survivors treated for osteosarcoma or with stem cell transplantation (SCT) rated their physical HRQL significantly lower than the others. SCT treatment indicated significantly lower MCS scores than the reference treatment. Correlation between the physical component summary (PCS) scores and 15D total scores was low (R\u00a0=\u00a00.20\u20130.28). MCS and 15D total scores correlated (R\u00a0=\u00a00.48\u20130.60) better with each other, but the gained correlation coefficients still differed significantly from each other (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and showed better correlation in the controls. Conclusions: Our findings suggest, that the diagnosis of osteosarcoma, and SCT treatment are substantial risks for adverse HRQL. However, disease related factors did not remarkably explain the variation of HRQL scores gained with generic HRQL instruments. Our findings suggest, that the diagnosis of osteosarcoma, and SCT treatment are substantial risks for adverse HRQL. More evaluation is needed in order to decide whether any of the available generic instruments are feasible for studying HRQL for this special population.",

The results of existing studies have been inconclusive. The purpose was to examine the relationship between level of folate intake and the incidence of colorectal cancer. Methods: A systematic review and meta analysis were conducted. MEDLINE, Embase, and SCOPUS were searched from inception to October 2009 with the following search terms \u201cfolic acid,\u201d \u201cfolate\u201d, \u201ccolorectal cancer,\u201d \u201ccolon neoplasms,\u201d rectal neoplasms.\u201d Observational studies in adult populations were included that defined levels of folate intake and incidence of colorectal cancer. Result: Out of 6427 references, 27 studies met our inclusion criteria. The summary risk estimate for case control studies comparing high versus low total folate intake was 0.85 (CI 95% 0.74\u20130.99) with no significant heterogeneity among studies. Similarly, for cohort studies, the resulting summary risk estimate for high versus low dietary folate intake was 0.92 (CI 95% 0.81\u20131.05) with no significant heterogeneity. However, defining what represents a higher intake of folic acid is difficult as there is variability in the upper limit of folic acid intake used in the studies. Discussion: These results suggest that higher folate intake levels offer a reduction in one of the perceived risks associated with developing colorectal cancer. These data can serve to help reassure women planning a pregnancy to increase folic intake during the preconception period to levels sufficient to prevent neural tube defects.",

     "abstract": "Background: The publication of the Women's Health Initiative Study in 2002 spurred reductions in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use worldwide. Subsequent drops in breast cancer incidence have since been reported. We used person-level data from a large Israeli health plan to study the relationship between HRT use and breast cancer incidence. Methods: We accessed pharmacy, mammography and cancer registry data for women ages 50 and over. Using Chi-square analysis, we examined changes over time in HRT and mammography utilization and breast cancer incidence [invasive and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)]. Using calendar year-specific Cox proportional hazards analyses, we estimated the hazard of recent HRT use on cancer incidence. We used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modeling to further examine this association. Results: The study population ranged from 118,724 in 2000 to 154,447 in 2007. Thirteen percent of study women purchased HRT in 2000, vs. 4.0% in 2007 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Breast cancer incidence rose from 3.8/1000 to 4.3/1000 in 2005; the proportion of women undergoing mammography rose from 8% in 2000 to a peak of 34.1% in 2005 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Hazard ratios for the association of HRT with breast cancer ranged from 1.2 to 2.4. ARIMA demonstrated the association of both mammography (in the same month) and HRT use (in the preceding month) with cancer incidence. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the competing impacts of HRT and mammography on cancer incidence. Our findings support the conclusion that changes in HRT utilization are linked to reductions in breast cancer incidence.",

This paper describes the structure and goals of a Colon Disease Family Registry at a metropolitan hospital. Patient characteristics, differences between gastrointestinal diseases among probands, subjective distress in relation to perception of colorectal cancer, and quality of life were examined. Methods: Participants were patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC) and inflammatory bowel disease ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease representing a range of colonic diseases. A total of 630 probands were recruited into the registry and administered a questionnaire. Results: Of the 630 probands, 198 (31.4%) were diagnosed with CRC, 36 (5.3%) with FAP or HNPCC and 272 (43.2%) with UC or Crohn's. The majority of all three groups had some level of college education, was white, and reported a household income greater then $70,000.

On the quality of life item, the largest difference was between FAP or HNPCC and UC or Crohn's without CRC. Conclusion: Subjective distress scores were higher for CRC probands in comparison to probands with other colorectal diseases. Quality of life was relatively high for all probands. Psychological distress should be explored in more depth and more frequently to screen for any concomitant psychiatric disorders like post-traumatic symptoms that have been linked to a cancer diagnosis.",

     "abstract": "Background: Global variations in the frequency of the major sub-types of lymphoma have been reported. However, studies on different sub-types of adult malignant lymphoma had never been conducted in Mashhad, Iran. In this paper, we aimed to identify the major sub-types of malignant lymphoma in our area and compare the distribution with other published studies. Methods: During a retrospective study we evaluate 391 adult patients with lymphoid malignancy from \u201cOmid Hospital\u201d \u2013 a cancer research center and an outpatient hematologic clinic in Mashhad \u2013 were evaluated from 2000 to 2009. Patients were reclassified using the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Results: The frequency of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) was 92% (n\u00a0=\u00a0359) and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) was 8% (n\u00a0=\u00a032). The most frequent NHL sub-type using WHO classification was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and the second most common NHL was chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The most common sub-type of HL was mixed cellularity. In this study the frequency of primary extranodal NHL in our study was 11.5%, which slightly less common than other eastern countries. Conclusion: Our findings add to the body of knowledge concerning geographic variations in the descriptive epidemiology of the major lymphoma sub-types. Such observations are extremely important since they potentially point to underling etiological variations.",

     "abstract": "Background: The association between a history of cancer and mortality has not been studied in a propensity-matched population of community-dwelling older adults. Methods: Of the 5795 participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study, 827 (14%) had self-reported physician-diagnosed cancer at baseline. Propensity scores for cancer were used to assemble a cohort of 789 and 3118 participants with and without cancer respectively who were balanced on 45 baseline characteristics. Cox regression models were used to determine the association between cancer and all-cause mortality among matched patients, and to identify independent predictors of mortality among unmatched cancer patients. Results: Matched participants had a mean (SD) age of 74 (6) years, 57% were women, 10% were African Americans, and 38% died from all causes during 12 years of follow-up. All-cause mortality occurred in 41% and 37% of matched participants with and without a history of cancer respectively (hazard ratio when cancer was compared with no cancer, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 1.02\u20131.31; P\u00a0=\u00a00.019). Among those with cancer, older age, male gender, smoking, lower than college education, fair-to-poor self-reported health, coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, increased heart rate, low hemoglobin and low baseline albumin were associated with increased risk of mortality. Conclusions: Among community-dwelling older adults, a history of cancer was associated with increased mortality and among those with cancer, several socio-demographic variables and morbidities predicted mortality. These findings suggest that addressing traditional risk factors for cardiovascular mortality may help improve outcomes in older adults with a history of cancer.",

     "abstract": "Background: There is continuing public and scientific interest in the possibility that exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF) from mobile telephones or other wireless devices and applications might increase the risk of certain cancers or other diseases. The interest is amplified by the rapid world-wide penetration of such technologies. The evidence from epidemiological studies published to date have not been consistent and, in particular, further studies are required to identify whether longer term (well beyond 10 years) RF exposure might pose some health risk. Methods: The \u201cCosmos\u201d study described here is a large prospective cohort study of mobile telephone users (ongoing recruitment of 250,000 men and women aged 18+ years in five European countries \u2013 Denmark, Finland, Sweden, The Netherlands, UK) who will be followed up for 25+ years. Information on mobile telephone use is collected prospectively through questionnaires and objective traffic data from network operators. Associations with disease risks will be studied by linking cohort members to existing disease registries, while changes in symptoms such as headache and sleep quality and of general well-being are assessed by baseline and follow-up questionnaires. Conclusions: A prospective cohort study conducted with appropriate diligence and a sufficient sample size, overcomes many of the shortcomings of previous studies. Its major advantages are exposure assessment prior to the diagnosis of disease, the prospective collection of objective exposure information, long-term follow-up of multiple health outcomes, and the flexibility to investigate future changes in technologies or new research questions.",

We performed a case-control study aimed at investigating if a past history of breast cancer is a risk factor of developing adenomas or CRC and establishing whether tamoxifen exposure is an additional risk factor. Materials and methods: We enrolled 175 asymptomatic women with a past history of BC and invited them to undergo a screening colonoscopy. In the same period, we enrolled 201 healthy asymptomatic women (HG) with no family history of CRC which were referred to our Unit for a colonoscopy. Results: Mean age at colonoscopy was 56.9 years for BC patients vs. 56.3 years for HG (p\u00a0=\u00a00.58). In 32/175 (18.3%) BC patients, 38 lesions and in 17/201 (8.4%) controls, 20 lesions (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) were diagnosed. BC patients had 5/32 CRC vs. no CRC in the HG. Multivariate analysis of age, family history of CRC, timing from BC diagnosis and first colonoscopy, tamoxifen treatment revealed that none of the variables were predictive of the presence or absence of adenomas or CRC in the BC group. Discussion: In the present study BC group had a significant higher prevalence of adenoma or CRC than controls. Tamoxifen exposure did not increase the risk of adenoma or CRC. Our data support the hypothesis that BC is a risk condition for adenomas or CRC. The risk is small but present and a screening colonoscopy should be offered to these patients.",

Methods: In a case\u2013control study of women from Shanghai, China, we examined the risk of breast cancer and fibrocystic breast conditions associated with the ESR1 PvuII (rs2234693) and XbaI (rs9340799) and AR CAG repeat ((CAG)n) and GGC repeat ((GGC)n) polymorphisms among 614 women with breast cancer, 467 women with fibrocystic conditions, and 879 women without breast disease. We also evaluated whether risk differed by the presence/absence of proliferative changes (in the extratumoral epithelium or fibrocystic lesion), menopausal status, or body mass index (BMI). Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using logistic regression. Results: Only associations with AR (CAG)n and (GGC)n genotypes were detected. Allocating AR (CAG)n genotypes into six categories, with the (CAG)22\u201324/(CAG)22\u201324 genotype category designated as the reference group, the (CAG)>24/(CAG)>24 genotype category was associated with an increased risk of fibrocystic breast conditions (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1\u20133.0).

     "abstract": "Objective: To examine the association between cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and risk of incident prostate cancer (PrCA). Methods: Participants were 19,042 male subjects in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS), ages 20\u201382\u00a0years, who received a baseline medical examination including a maximal treadmill exercise test between 1976 and 2003. CRF levels were defined as low (lowest 20%), moderate (middle 40%), and high (upper 40%) according to age-specific distribution of treadmill duration from the overall ACLS population. PrCA was assessed from responses to mail-back health surveys during 1982\u20132004. Cox proportional hazards regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, were used to compute hazard ratios (HRs), 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), and incidence rates (per 10,000 person-years of follow-up). Results: A total of 634 men reported a diagnosis of incident PrCA during an average of 9.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.1\u00a0years of follow-up. Adjusted HRs (95% CIs) in men with moderate and high CRF relative to low CRF were, 1.68 (1.13\u20132.48) and 1.74 (1.15\u20132.62), respectively. The positive association between CRF and PrCA was observed only in the strata of men who were not obese, had \u22651 follow-up examination, or who were diagnosed \u22641995. Conclusions: Rather than revealing a causal relationship, the unexpected positive association observed between CRF and incident PrCA is most likely due to a screening/detection bias in more fit men who also are more health-conscious. Results have important implications for understanding the health-related factors that predispose men to receive PrCA screening that may lead to over-detection of indolent disease.",

Genetic polymorphisms in metabolic enzymes as gene susceptibility factors may modify colorectal cancer risk. We evaluated the risk of colorectal cancer associated with respective or combined glutathione S-transferase (GST) polymorphisms and assessed the interactions between genes and environmental factors in a case\u2013control study in an Indian population. Methods: The study included 59 colon and 243 rectal cancer cases, and 291 cancer-free healthy controls. GST genotypes were detected by multiplex PCR-based and PCR-RFLP methods. The risk of cancer associated with GST polymorphisms was estimated by calculation of odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (95% CIs) using unconditional logistic regression. Results: The GSTM1 null genotype was found to be associated with a significantly increased rectal cancer risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.55; 95% CI, 1.05\u20132.30), while the GSTT1 null genotype with a greater risk of colon cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.15; 95% CI, 1.04\u20134.32).

     "abstract": "Objective: To examine whether exposures or activities in farming, forestry and related occupations explain the excess incidence of germ cell cancer (GCC) observed among male employees in one of the six car-manufacturing plants that is located in a geographic area where farming is frequent. Methods: A cohort based case\u2013control study was conducted among workers in six car-manufacturing plants located in areas with different industrial structure. The study involved 188 cases of germ cell cancer identified through active retrieval in 38 hospitals and 1000 controls, drawn from administrative accounting files, individually matched by year of birth (\u00b12 years). Information regarding tasks and exposures and potential confounding variables were obtained by face-to-face or telephone interviews. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using a conditional logistic regression model adjusted for cryptorchidism and other potential confounders. Results: In this case\u2013control study 5.3% of cases and 6.3% of controls ever worked in agriculture or livestock farming. No increased risks were observed for working in agriculture (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.8 95% CI: 0.4\u20131.6), livestock farming (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.8 95% CI: 0.4\u20131.6) or for exposure to pesticides (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.7 95% CI: 0.3\u20131.7), for exposure to fertilizers (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.8 95% CI: 0.4\u20131.8) and disinfectants (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.0 95% CI: 0.3\u20132.8). There were no statistically significant increases in risk associated with ever exposure to salt based wood protection agents (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.3 95% CI: 0.6\u20139.1), working with plywood (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.4 95% CI: 0.6\u20133.2), coated wood (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.4 95% CI: 0.5\u20133.9) or working in forestry (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.7 95% CI: 0.5\u20136.4). Lagging of exposures did not alter the results. Conclusions: The observed excess incidence in the cohort of automotive workers can be hardly explained by previous or concurrent work in farming or forestry. Because of the small numbers of subjects ever employed in farming the statistical power in assessing associations between agricultural work and agricultural exposures was limited and does not allow final conclusions about the association of farming related exposures and GCC risk.",

Our aim was to determine the diffusion pattern and identify the factors associated with early participation in stomach and breast cancer screening programs. Methods: The study population was derived from the Korean National Cancer Screening Survey, conducted in 2007. A stratified random sample of people aged 40 years and older from a nationwide population-based database was gathered in Korea (n\u00a0=\u00a01,517) in 2007. Time of participation in early screening was defined as the number of years that had elapsed between the participant's 30th birthday and the age at first screening. Results: Significant differences were observed in the probability of adopting stomach and breast cancer screening in relation to education, household income, and job level. Results from Cox's proportional hazard model indicated that higher household income was significantly associated with an increased probability of adopting stomach cancer screening earlier (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and people with high household incomes were more likely to adopt breast cancer screening earlier than were those with incomes under US$1,500 per month (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). When considered at a significance level of 0.1, we found that the most highly educated women were more likely than the least educated to be screened early. Conclusions: Despite organized governmental screening programs, there are still inequalities in the early adoption of cancer screening. The results of this study also suggest that inequalities in early adoption may affect participation in regular screening.",

     "publication date": "02-2011",
     "abstract": "Background: Colorectal cancer is preventable by early detection and removal of precursor lesions. Central to early stages of colorectal neoplasia is activation of Wnt signaling, usually due to inactivation of the Apc tumor suppressor gene for which there is an established animal model, the ApcMin mouse. Immunodetection in stool of proteins up-regulated by aberrant Wnt signaling, within intestinal epithelial cells shed into the lumen, could be a rational approach to identify biomarkers of early intestinal neoplasia. Fem1b gene expression is up-regulated, following inactivation of Apc, in mouse intestinal epithelium. Methods: We initially screened pooled random stool samples by immunoblotting and found that we could detect, in ApcMin mice but not wild-type mice, a fragment of Fem1b protein with an antibody (Li-50) directed against an epitope near the middle of the protein, but not with antibodies directed against N-terminus or C-terminus epitopes. We then evaluated freshly voided individual stool samples collected on four consecutive days from four each of male and female ApcMin mice and their wild-type littermates. Results: The Fem1b antigen was detected with the Li-50 antibody in 15/16 samples from male ApcMin mice compared to 0/16 samples from male wild-type mice, and in 5/16 samples from female ApcMin mice compared to 0/16 samples from female wild-type mice. Conclusions: This study provides proof-of-principle that fragments of proteins, whose expression is increased by aberrant Wnt signaling early in intestinal neoplasia, can be immunodetected in stool. Excreted Fem1b protein fragments may be a useful biomarker for epithelial Wnt signaling and early intestinal neoplasia.",

However, it has been shown previously that male DNA can be detected in vaginal swabs. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a female vaginal swab may reflect a male active HPV infection.Methods: Eleven women volunteered to take vaginal samples. The first sample was taken within hours after unprotected intercourse, the others each following morning for five consecutive days. On these samples, a Y-chromosomal locus, as a surrogate marker for HPV, was amplified by PCR. To investigate the prevalence of male DNA in self-obtained vaginal swabs, 282 swabs from 16 women enrolled in an ongoing HPV follow-up study were tested.Results: All baseline samples from the 11 women were positive for male DNA. In the follow-up samples, positivity ranged from day 1 till day 5, with a sharp drop from day 2 (91%) to day 3 (36%). Of 282 swabs, 23 (8.2%) were positive for male DNA. However, 10 of these 23 swabs were provided by one single woman.Discussion: Since HPV can be deposited by the male in the vagina, either through semen, or through exfoliated epithelial cells, our results are of some importance when testing for HPV in vaginal swabs. It is conceivable that women with acquired immunity to HPV, but with an HPV positive partner, are found to be HPV positive in the swab.

Results: For all cancer diagnoses combined, 5-year survival was 72.7% dropping to 67.9% at 15 years. As expected, survival differed between diagnostic subtypes ranging from 38.1% for intracranial embryonal tumours to 96.2% for Hodgkin lymphoma. Compared to girls, boys diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were at a higher risk of dying (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.26, 95% CI 1.03\u20131.53), whereas boys diagnosed with an intracranial embryonal tumour were at a lower risk of death (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.63, 95% CI 0.43\u20130.91). Conclusion: Our initial findings are consistent with previous reports, and highlight the importance of considering differences by age and sex. The completeness and population-based nature of the original case\u2013control study is an important feature which will provide the basis for future more detailed investigations linking disease determinants to outcome.",

     "abstract": "Background: Recent research suggested that cancer survival has improved in recent cohorts. Improvement in cancer survival is considered a valid indicator of the quality of care introduced to the patients. The aim of this study is to investigate the changes in the survival profile over age for patients with the most incident cancers. Methods: Survival data of 3.94 million patients diagnosed with 23 primary-site cancers within the periods of 1979\u20131983, 1989\u20131993, and 1999\u20132003 were adopted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Gender and cause-specific survival probabilities were estimated at one, three, and five years after diagnosis using the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival estimate. Survival was presented for each of the studied cancers, cohorts, and sexes in the form of line graphs as a function of age at diagnosis. Error bars demonstrated the probability of error at 95% confidence level. Results: The graphs demonstrated that cancer survival was improved over the successive cohorts for most cancers, with several exceptions such as brain and lung cancers. The relation between survival and the age at diagnosis was generally described in the form of a gradual decline phase and a rapid fall-off phase at 70\u201380 years of age, with few exceptions as in leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma. Patients who survived for three years were more likely to live for five years after diagnosis, but this prediction could not be extrapolated to the one-year survivors. Conclusion: Further studies on tumor-specific characteristics and treatment modalities of these patients are suggested for clarification of the possible causes of variations in patient's survival profile over age.",

     "abstract": "Background: Socio-economic differences in survival from head and neck cancers are among the largest of any malignancies. Population-based data have been unable to explain these differences. Aims: To describe survival from head and neck cancers in a large cohort of patients for whom a range of socio-economic, demographic, behavioural and casemix data was available. Methods: Prospective cohort study using data from the Scottish Head and Neck Audit on all patients diagnosed with a head and neck cancer in Scotland between 1st September 1999 and 31st August 2001 linked to General Register Office for Scotland death records to 30th June 2006. Cox proportional hazards models were produced to describe adjusted hazards of death according to socio-economic circumstances, using validated area-based DEPCAT scores. Results: Data on 1909 patients were analysed. 71.0% were male and mean age was 64.3 (SD 12.2) years. Overall 5-year survival was 45.6% (95% CI: 43.4\u201347.8%). In order of strength of association in univariate regression, World Health Organisation Performance Status, disease stage, patient age, tumour site, smoking status, alcohol use, tumour differentiation, and deprivation were significant predictors of all-cause mortality but after multiple adjustment, deprivation was no longer an independent predictor of survival. Conclusions: Socio-economic differentials in survival from head and neck cancers are determined by a mixture of risk factors, some of which may be amenable to targeted earlier detection methods and lifestyle interventions. However, further research is needed to understand the impacts of performance status in more deprived patients.",

     "abstract": "Background: The two main types of non-melanoma skin cancer differ with the pattern of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR): basal cell carcinoma (BCC) appears to be more closely related to intermittent solar exposure and sunburn, while the risk for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a result of lifetime cumulated exposure to UVR. As these exposures may differ by social position, we investigated its role in the risk for and survival after BCC and SCC diagnosed in Denmark in 1994\u20132006 with follow-up through 2006. Methods: The analyses were based on 52,166 cases of BCC and 5033 cases of SCC in a cohort of 3.7 million people born between 1925 and 1976 and residing in Denmark in 1992\u20132006. Information on cancer cases and socioeconomic indicators were obtained from population-based registries. We used log-linear Poisson regression models to estimate incidence rate ratios and cumulative relative survival to estimate survival up to 10 years after the first incident cases of BCC and SCC. Results: High socioeconomic status, measured by both education and disposable income, was strongly associated with a higher risk for BCC, whereas there was no association between SCC and educational level and only a weak association with income. In general, relative survival after BCC was better than after SCC; the pattern of survival was not affected by socioeconomic indicators. Conclusions: The observed pattern of social status and risk for non-melanoma skin cancer differed substantially for the two cancer types, supporting the hypothesis that they may have different aetiologies.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: Until now, studies examining the relationship between socioeconomic status and pancreatic cancer incidence have been inconclusive. Aim: To prospectively investigate to what extent pancreatic cancer incidence varies according to educational level within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study. Methods: In the EPIC study, socioeconomic status at baseline was measured using the highest level of education attained. Hazard ratios by educational level and a summary index, the relative indices of inequality (RII), were estimated using Cox regression models stratified by age, gender, and center and adjusted for known risk factors. In addition, we conducted separate analyses by age, gender and geographical region. Results: Within the source population of 407, 944 individuals at baseline, 490 first incident primary pancreatic adenocarcinoma cases were identified in 9 European countries. The crude difference in risk of pancreatic cancer according to level of education was small and not statistically significant (RII\u00a0=\u00a01.14, 95% CI 0.80\u20131.62). Adjustment for known risk factors reduced the inequality estimates to only a small extent. In addition, no statistically significant associations were observed for age groups (adjusted RII\u2264 60 years\u00a0=\u00a00.85, 95% CI 0.44\u20131.64, adjusted RII>60 years\u00a0=\u00a01.18, 95% CI 0.73\u20131.90), gender (adjusted RIImale\u00a0=\u00a01.20, 95% CI 0.68\u20132.10, adjusted RIIfemale\u00a0=\u00a00.96, 95% CI 0.56\u20131.62) or geographical region (adjusted RIINorthern Europe\u00a0=\u00a01.14, 95% CI 0.81\u20131.61, adjusted RIIMiddle Europe\u00a0=\u00a01.72, 95% CI 0.93\u20133.19, adjusted RIISouthern Europe\u00a0=\u00a00.75, 95% CI 0.32\u20131.80).

     "abstract": "Background: This study investigated the role that demographic and tumour factors play in explaining socioeconomic inequalities in breast cancer survival. Methods: Breast cancer cases notified to the New Zealand Cancer Registry (NZCR) from April 2005 to April 2007 were followed up to April 2009. The New Zealand area-based deprivation index (NZDep) was used as a measure of socioeconomic position. Relative survival rates were estimated using sex-, deprivation- and ethnic-specific life tables. Multiple imputation was used to impute missing data. Excess mortality modelling was used to estimate the contribution of demographic and tumour factors to inequalities in survival. Results: There were 2968 breast cancer cases included and 433 recorded deaths. Relative survival rates at 4 years varied across deprivation groups. Using NZDep deciles 1\u20134 (least deprived) as the reference group, the age- and ethnicity-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for NZDep deciles 7\u20138 was 2.03 (CI 1.36\u20133.04) and for NZDep deciles 9\u201310 was 1.93 (CI 1.28\u20132.92). In the fully adjusted model there remained 50% excess mortality for the two most deprived groups compared to the most affluent. Variables which measured timely access to care (extent/size) accounted for more of the survival disparity than breast cancer subtype variables (ER/PR/HER2). Conclusion: Women from deprived areas in New Zealand who are diagnosed with breast cancer are less likely to survive as long as those from affluent areas. A substantial proportion of these socioeconomic disparities can be attributed to differential access to health care although other factors, currently unknown, are also likely to play an important role.",

The study involved 91 NHL cases and 182 controls nested in the Italian branch of the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation of Cancer and nutrition) cohort, which obtained blood samples from 47,749 healthy volunteers between 1993 and 1998 in 5 Italian cities. NHL cases were identified until June 2005 through linkage with records of the Cancer, Mortality, and Hospital Discharge Registries. For all study subjects, we performed viral genome analyses on DNA and RNA extracted from buffy-coats and analysed EBV and HCV antibodies. The odds ratios (ORs) of NHL were 1.2 (95% confidence intervals: 0.4\u20133.8; 5 exposed cases) for PBMC HCV infection and 1.2 (0.7\u20132.3; 24 exposed cases) for PBMC EBV infection. Similar OR estimates were found for detection of EBV and HCV antibodies. These null results, although based on a relatively small sample size, suggest that persistent EBV and HCV infection in the PBMC is not a stronger predictor of NHL risk than serological evidence of infection.",

Methods: The study population consisted of 15\u00a0565 men and women who visited the National Cancer Center, Korea between August 2002 and July 2009. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect information on demographic characteristics, medical history, including chronic HBV and HCV infection, and health check-up history.

     "abstract": "Background: Promoter methylation of tumor suppressor genes is a frequent and early event in breast carcinogenesis. Paired tumor tissue and serum samples from women with breast cancer show that promoter methylation is detectable in both sample types, with good concordance. This suggests the potential for these serum markers to be used for breast cancer detection. Methods: The current study was a case\u2013control study nested within the prospective New York University Women's Health Study cohort aimed to assess the ability of promoter methylation in serum to detect pre-clinical disease. Cases were women with blood samples collected within the 6 months preceding breast cancer diagnosis (n\u00a0=\u00a050). Each case was matched to 2 healthy cancer-free controls and 1 cancer-free control with a history of benign breast disease (BBD). Results: Promoter methylation analysis of four cancer-related genes: \u2014 RASSF1A, GSTP1, APC and RAR\u03b22, \u2014 was conducted using quantitative methylation-specific PCR. Results showed that the frequency of methylation was lower than expected among cases and higher than expected among controls. Methylation was detected in the promoter region of: RASSF1A in 22.0%, 22.9% and 17.2% of cases, BBD controls and healthy controls respectively; GSTP1 in 4%, 10.4% and 7.1% respectively; APC in 2.0%, 4.4% and 4.2% respectively and RAR\u03b22 in 6.7%, 2.3% and 1.1% respectively. Conclusion: Methylation status of the four genes included in this study was unable to distinguish between cases and either control group. This study highlights some methodological issues to be addressed in planning prospective studies to evaluate methylation markers as diagnostic biomarkers.",

     "abstract": "Bladder cancer accounts for nearly 5% of all newly diagnosed cancers in Jordan, with a much higher frequency in males. Recent studies have shown that activating mutations in FGFR3 are the most common findings in non-invasive low grade bladder tumors. In this study, we, retrospectively, investigated a cohort of 121 bladder cancer patients with various grades and stages of the tumor for molecular changes in FGFR3. Overexpression of FGFR3 was observed in 49%, 34%, 15%, and 2% of pTa, pT1, pT2, and pT3 cases, respectively. Further, FGFR3 expression was positive in 45%, 26%, and 30% of G1, G2 and G3 cases, respectively. Mutational analysis of exons 7, 10 and 15 of FGFR3 identified four previously reported mutations, namely R248C (n\u00a0=\u00a04; 10%), S249C (n\u00a0=\u00a023; 59%), Y375C (n\u00a0=\u00a07; 18%), G382R (n\u00a0=\u00a04; 10%), and one novel mutation, G382E (n\u00a0=\u00a01; 3%). Our results indicate that both mutations and overexpression of FGFR3 are correlated together, and are more prevalent in early stage (pTa and pT1) and low grade (G1 and G2) bladder tumors. Survival analysis showed no contribution of changes in FGFR3 on the patient's survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis of overall survival for the following variables: age, gender, stage and grade of tumor, and FGFR3 (expression and mutation) revealed that age, stage and grade of tumor are independent predictors of overall survival in patients with bladder cancer. Our work is the first to address the molecular status of FGFR3 in Jordanian patients with bladder cancer, and provides further support for FGFR3 as a key player in the initiation of bladder tumors.",

Methods: Blood and tissue samples were collected from seven patients with colorectal carcinoma (CRC), while blood samples were also collected from two healthy controls as control. Using the real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) and DNA melting curve analysis techniques, the features of T-cell receptor beta chain variable region (TRBV) were determined. Results: The gene melting spectral pattern (GMSP) of 24 TRBV gene families exhibited a highly diverse multimodal shape for most of the TRBV gene families, compared to healthy controls, the more GMSP of patients with CRC showed either a single peak, or several prominent melting peaks (skewed) for certain TRBV gene families. Different patients have different skewed patterns.

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the nature of this association. Methods: Search strategies were conducted in Ovid Medline (1950\u20132009), Embase (1980\u20132009), Web of Science (1970\u20132009), and CINAHL (1937\u20132009) using keywords for maternal weight (BMI) and testicular cancer. Results: The literature search produced 1689 hits from which 63 papers were extracted. Only 7 studies met the pre-defined criteria. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted. The combined unadjusted OR (95% CI) of testicular cancer in the highest reported category of maternal BMI compared with the moderate maternal BMI was 0.82 (0.65\u20131.02). The Cochran's Q P value was 0.82 and the corresponding I2 was 0%, both indicating very little variability among studies. The combined unadjusted OR (95% CI) for testicular cancer risk in the lowest reported category of maternal BMI compared to a moderate maternal BMI category was 0.88 (0.65\u20131.20). The Cochran's Q P value was 0.05 and the corresponding I2 was 54%, indicating evidence of statistical heterogeneity. The combined unadjusted OR (95% CI) of testicular cancer risk per unit increase in maternal BMI was 1.01 (0.97\u20131.06). The Cochran's Q test had a P value of 0.05 and the corresponding I2 was 55% indicating evidence of statistical heterogeneity. Conclusion: This meta-analysis, which included a small number of studies, showed that a higher maternal weight does not increase the risk of testicular cancer in male offspring. Though an inverse association between high maternal BMI and testicular cancer risk was detected, it was not statistically significant.

     "abstract": "One of the potential strategies for preventing cancers is using food-based natural products to induce cytoprotective enzymes including phase II and antioxidative enzymes that act in concert to detoxify and eliminate harmful reactive intermediates formed from carcinogens. The antioxidant response element (ARE), which is activated upon binding of the nuclear factor E2-related protein 2 (Nrf2) transcription factor protein, has been identified in the regulatory regions of numerous genes encoding cytoprotective enzymes. Herein, we summarized the current body of knowledge regarding Nrf2 regulation as well as highlighted the Nrf2/ARE activators from natural products, which will potentially be used as chemopreventive agents for cancer patients. Methods: Via reviewing Pubmed, we summarized the current progress in the molecular mechanisms of Nrf2 regulation and the major classes of dietary components that act as promising chemopreventive agents through evoking Nrf2-ARE core signaling pathway. Results: Under basal condition, Nrf2 is at low level, sequestered in the cytoplasm by being tethered to an actin binding Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1). Pharmacological and putative chemopreventive agents trigger the release of Nrf2 from Keap1, allowing it to translocate into the nucleus and drive the gene expression of detoxifying enzymes to perform cancer chemoproventive effect. Conclusion: Augmenting both expression and activity of phase II detoxification and antioxidant enzymes via Nrf2-ARE core signaling pathway would be a rational approach for cancer chemoprevention and the number of novel Nrf2/ARE activators from dietary sources is growing.",

Method: The prediction model was derived from 28,115 men in the Japan Public Health Center-based (JPHC) Prospective Study Cohort II (follow-up: 1993\u20132005), with risk factors selected by Cox proportion hazard regression. 18,256 men in the JPHC Study Cohort I (follow-up: 1995\u20132005) were used to evaluate the model's performance. Results: 543 and 398 CRCs were diagnosed during the follow-up period in Cohorts II and I, respectively. The prediction model, including age, BMI, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and the daily physical activity level, showed modest discrimination ability for CRC (C\u00a0=\u00a00.70; 95% confidential interval, 0.68\u20130.72) in Cohort II and well calibrated in Cohort I (Hosmer\u2013Lemeshow \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a014.2, P\u00a0=\u00a00.08). Conclusion: The 10-year CRC risk prediction model may be used to estimate CRC risk in Japanese men. It may also play a role in the promotion of CRC prevention strategies.",

     "abstract": "Background: The disparity in breast cancer mortality rates among white and black US women is widening, with higher mortality rates among black women. We apply functional time series models on age-specific breast cancer mortality rates for each group of women, and forecast their mortality curves using exponential smoothing state-space models with damping. Materials and Methods: The data were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program of the US [1]. Mortality data were obtained from the National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) available on the SEER*Stat database. We use annual unadjusted breast cancer mortality rates from 1969 to 2004 in 5-year age groups (45\u201349, 50\u201354, 55\u201359, 60\u201364, 65\u201369, 70\u201374, 75\u201379, 80\u201384). Age-specific mortality curves were obtained using nonparametric smoothing methods. The curves are then decomposed using functional principal components and we fit functional time series models with four basis functions for each population separately. The curves from each population are forecast and prediction intervals are calculated. Results: Twenty-year forecasts indicate an overall decline in future breast cancer mortality rates for both groups of women. This decline appears to be steeper among white women aged 55\u201373 and black women aged 60\u201384. For black women under 55 years of age, the forecast rates are relatively stable indicating there is no significant change in future breast cancer mortality rates among young black women in the next 20 years. Conclusion: White women have smooth and consistent patterns in breast cancer mortality rates for all age-groups whereas the mortality rates for black women are much more variable. The projections suggest, for some age groups, black American women may not benefit equally from the overall decline in breast cancer mortality in the United States.",

However, this approach may lead to biased comparisons of survival between cancer registries, or over time within a single registry. Purpose: To examine the impact of including multiple primary cancers in the derivation of survival estimates using data from a population-based national cancer registry. Methods: Five-year relative survival estimates for persons aged 15\u201399 years at diagnosis were derived using all eligible primary cases from the Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR)\u2014a population-based registry containing information on cases diagnosed from 1992 onward\u2014and then again using first primary cases only. Any pre-1992 cancer history of persons on the CCR was obtained by using auxiliary information. Results: The inclusion of multiple cancers resulted in lower estimates of 5-year relative survival for virtually all cancers studied. The effect was somewhat attenuated by age-standardization (e.g., from 1.3% to 1.0% for all cancers combined), and was greatest for bladder cancer (\u22122.4%) followed by oral cancer (\u22121.9%)\u2014cancers that had the first and third lowest proportions of first cancers, respectively. For the majority of cancers the difference was less than 1.0%. Cancers for which there was virtually no difference (e.g., lung, pancreatic, ovarian and liver) tended to be those with a poor prognosis. Conclusion: Inclusion of second and subsequent primary cancers in the analysis tended to lower estimates of relative survival, the extent of which varied by cancer and age and depended in part on the proportion of first primary cancers.",

Standardized dietary data from 4- to 7-day food diaries and from FFQ were used to estimate odds ratios for CRC risk associated with intake of fat and subtypes of fat using conditional logistic regression. We also calculated multivariate measurement error corrected odds ratios for CRC using repeated food diary measurements. Results: We observed no associations between intakes of total dietary fat or types of fat and CRC risk, irrespective of whether dietary data were obtained using food diaries or FFQ.

However, several reports claim that there is no association between a higher insulin level and the risk of incident prostate cancer. In the present report, the insulin hypothesis was tested once more prospectively in men with a benign prostatic disorder. Three hundred and eighty-nine consecutive patients referred with lower urinary tract symptoms without clinical prostate cancer were included during 1994\u20132002. Follow-up was performed in 2006. Data were obtained from the Swedish National Cancer Register and the Regional Cancer Register, Oncological Centre, G\u00f6teborg, Sweden. At this follow-up, 44 of the patients included had developed prostate cancer. Men with prostate cancer diagnosis had a higher systolic (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and diastolic blood pressure (P\u00a0<\u00a00.000), were more obese as measured by BMI (P\u00a0=\u00a00.010), waist (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and hip measurements (P\u00a0=\u00a00.041) than men who did not have prostate cancer diagnosis at follow-up.

Following exclusion of T1a/b prostate cancer cases, the difference of the fasting serum insulin level between the groups was still significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.038). Our data support the hypothesis that a higher insulin level is a promoter of prostate cancer. Moreover, our data suggest that the insulin level could be used as a marker of the risk of developing prostate cancer. The present findings also seem to confirm that prostate cancer is a component of the metabolic syndrome. Finally, our data generate the hypothesis that the metabolic syndrome conceals early prostate cancer.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: Obesity is a well-established risk factor for postmenopausal breast cancer, but mechanisms underlying the association are unclear. Adipocyte-derived, cytokine-like adipokines have been suggested as contributory factors. To evaluate their association with breast cancer risk factors and breast cancer risk, we conducted a nested case-control study of 234 postmenopausal breast cancer cases and 234 controls in a cohort of U.S. women with prospectively-collected serum samples obtained in the mid 1970s and followed for up to 25 years. Methods: Adiponectin, absolute plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (aPAI-1), and resistin were measured by a multiplex immunoassay. Sex hormones were available for 67 cases and 67 controls. Results: Among controls, we found that lower levels of adiponectin and higher levels of aPAI-1 were correlated with increasing levels of estradiol (Spearman r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.26, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.033; r\u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003), decreasing levels of sex hormone binding globulin (r\u00a0=\u00a00.38, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0013; r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.32, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0076), and increasing body mass index (BMI) (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.31, p\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; r\u00a0=\u00a00.39, p\u00a0=\u00a0\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Hormones were not associated with resistin. Among the relatively small percentage of women using postmenopausal hormones at the time of blood collection (13.7%), aPAI-1 levels were higher than in non-users (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0054). Breast cancer risk was not associated with circulating levels of adiponectin (age-adjusted p for linear trend\u00a0=\u00a00.43), aPAI-1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.78), or resistin (p\u00a0=\u00a00.91). The association was not confounded by BMI, parity, age at first full-term birth, age at menopause, current postmenopausal hormone use, and circulating sex steroid hormones. Furthermore, adipokine associations were not modified by BMI (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The lack of association with risk may be due to measurement error of the laboratory assays. Discussion: lower levels of adiponectin and higher levels of aPAI-1 measured in prospectively-collected serum from postmenopausal women were associated with increasing BMI but not breast cancer risk.",

     "publication date": "10-2010",
     "abstract": "Background: CYP1A1 is one of the commonest genes which had been widely investigated to find the risk of various malignancies in different ethnic groups. The polymorphism in these genes with a combination of environmental exposure has been hypothesized to confer a differential risk of cancer for individuals carrying these genetic variants. Based on this model, individuals with higher CYP1A1 activity would be at increased risk of cancer when exposed to high levels of smoke components. The proposed mechanism involves cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1), a gene that is inducible by xenobiotics to produce genetic susceptibility for malignancies. Patients and procedures: We performed a case\u2013control study in 205 cases with histopathologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck and reported habits of bidi or cigarettes smoking and 245 similar controls to investigate the role of CYP1A1 polymorphisms in the risk of head and neck cancers especially among smokers of Hyderabad Indian population. Venous blood samples (5\u00a0ml) were collected from patients and control groups; genomic DNA was extracted and used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine the genotypes. RFLP assays were designed to detect each of the variant CYP1A1 alleles. Results and discussion: CYP1A1m1/m1 genotype (OR\u00a0=\u00a08.12, 95% CI: 3.27\u201321.30) and CYP1A1w1/m1 showed elevated risk when compared with CYP1A1w1/w1. Similarly CYP1A1w2/m2 (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.58, 95% CI: 0.94\u20132.67) and CYP1A1m2/m2 (OR\u00a0=\u00a06.31, 95% CI: 2.74\u201318.69) genotypes also showed elevated risk when compared with CYP1A1w2/w2 genotype. This data demonstrated that smoking was a risk factor for head and neck cancers. The m2 mutations were in close linkage disequilibrium with the m1 mutations; 53% m1 mutants had the mutation in the m2 site. Conclusion: Those individuals carrying at least one CYP1A1 m1 or m2 variant allele were at a 2-fold elevated risk for head and neck cancer. Our data clearly demonstrates that CYP1A1 is an important determinant in susceptibility to tobacco-induced head and neck carcinogens and there is an association between genetic polymorphism in the CYP1A1 locus and elevated risk of the type of smoking among Indians. This appears to be a new and important prognostic and diagnostic marker for determining the risk of head and neck cancers genetically.",

Objective. To evaluate whether GSTM1 and/or GSTT1 contribute to prostate cancer (CaP) etiology, we studied 110 incident CaP cases and 122 controls. Results. The probability of having CaP was increased in men who had homozygous deleted (non-functional) genotypes at GSTT1 (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.17; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01\u20133.79) but not GSTM1 (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.89; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.66\u20131.88). Hence, individuals lacking the GSTT1 gene are at approximately twofold higher risk of developing prostate cancer in comparison with individuals with at least one active allele in the GSTT1 locus.

Identification of specific predictors of screening may aid the development of interventions to improve overall CRC screening. Methods: An interview-based survey, conducted on subjects aged 30\u201370 years, assessed knowledge and perception towards CRC and screening tests.

The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and p27KIP1 is a hypothesized mechanism, although there is no consensus regarding the influence of H. pylori cagA(+) in the development of these genetic alterations. Goals: To verify the relationship among H. pylori infection, p53 mutations and p27Kip1 Protein (p27) expression in gastric adenocarcinomas (GA) seventy-four tissues were assayed by PCR for H. pylori and cagA presence. Mutational analysis of p53 gene was performed by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Seventy tissues were analyzed by an immunohistochemical method for p27 expression. Results: From the samples examined, 95% (70/74) were H. pylori positive, 63% cagA(+). Altered p53 electrophoretic mobility was found in 72% of cases and significantly more frequent in the presence of cagA. Considerable reduction in p27 expression (19%) was found with a tendency for association between cagA(+) and p27(\u2212), although the results were not statistically significant. Concomitant alterations of both suppressor genes were detected in 60% of cases. In the cases cagA(+), 66.7% of them had these concomitant alterations. Conclusions: The data suggest that H. pylori cagA(+) contributes to p53 alteration and indicate that concomitant gene inactivation, with reduced p27 expression, may be a mechanism in which H. pylori can promote the development and progression of gastric cancer.",

Results: The multivariate logistic regression analyses demonstrated potentially high risk gene\u2013gene interactions with the concurrent deletions of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes and GSTP1 variant genotypes (OR 5.81; 95% CI 1.01\u201340.28), the deletions of GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes with variant genotypes of CYP1A1*2A (OR 8.21; 95% CI 1.91\u201349.48), GSTT1 and GSTM1 deficient genotypes along with CYP2E1*1B variant genotypes (OR 6.73; 95% CI 1.32\u201322.81), the polymorphic genotypes of ABCB1 and deficient GSTT1 (OR 6.08; 95% CI 2.21\u201316.76) and an enhanced risk with the combined variant genotypes of CYP1A1*2A, GSTT1 and ABCB1 (OR 11.14; 95% CI 2.70\u201346.02). Conclusion: The findings indicate that the interactions associated with various drug metabolizing enzymes and transporter protein exhibit high risk for UADT cancers than that ascribed to a single susceptible gene. This was particularly established among the polymorphic carriers of CYP1A1*2A, GSTT1 and ABCB1 genes in the population investigated.",

     "abstract": "Background: The publication of the Women's Health Initiative Study [1] in 2002 and the Million Women Study [31] in 2003 on the association of menopausal hormone therapy (HT) and breast cancer were followed by a decrease in the prescription of HT to menopausal women in western countries. In the following years several papers from different countries reported declines in breast cancer incidence and discuss whether this decline is related to the decreased use of menopausal hormone therapy. Methods: We contribute further data by analysing breast cancer incidence rates from the Hamburg Cancer Registry, Germany, for the time period 1991\u20132006 and HT use data from a large case\u2013control study conducted in the Hamburg region. At first we determined whether there is a decline in breast cancer incidence in 2002/2003. To find supporting evidence for a causal relationship between breast cancer incidence and use of menopausal hormones we addressed the following issues: The decline in incidence should be more pronounced in the age groups, in which HT is used predominantly, i.e. age group 50\u201369. The decline in incidence should be most pronounced for breast cancer types more strongly associated with HT, i.e. invasive lobular cancer. Results: We observed a statistical significant decline in incidence of all invasive breast cancer in 2002/2003 in Hamburg. The increase in breast cancer incidence as well as the decline was most pronounced in the age group 50\u201369. Regarding the histological types of tumours in this age group the decline was only pronounced for invasive lobular cancer. The estimated prevalence of HT indicates a decreasing hormone use starting in 2001/2002. We found a strong decrease in prescriptions for menopausal hormone therapy between 2002 and 2005. Conclusion: In summary, our data add to the evidence of a relation between breast cancer incidence and menopausal hormone use.",

Methods: Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor was used for the detection of MG7-Ag in the sera of gastric cancer patients to develop an innovative, simple and rapid assay method for early diagnosis. The specific monoclonal MG7 antibodies were used as capture and detection receptors which were immobilized on the surface of SPR sensor chips for MG7-Ag identification in the human sera. The measurements include 9 cases of gastric cancer patients and 2 cases of healthy blood donors and a MKN45 cancer cell lysate solution sample for positive control. Results: The binding of MG7-Ag onto the sensor surface was observed from SPR spectra. The sera of most gastric cancer patients revealed much higher expression level of MG7-Ag than healthy human sera did in SPR measurement. Conclusion: The initial results demonstrate that the SPR biosensor has the potential for its application in the early diagnosis of gastric cancer. However, more tests need to be done to confirm the detection limitation and the criterion for cancer risk evaluation in early diagnosis.",

     "abstract": "Objectives: To compare the trends in prostate cancer incidence, treatment with curative intent and mortality across regions and counties in Norway, and to consider changes in incidence (an indicator for early diagnosis) and treatment with curative intent as explanatory factors for the decreasing prostate cancer mortality rates. Patients and methods: Prostate cancer incidence and mortality data (1980\u20132007) alongside treatment data (1987\u20132005) were obtained from the national, population-based Cancer Registry of Norway. Joinpoint regression models were fitted to age-adjusted incidence, treatment and mortality rates to identify linear changes in the trends. Results: Both age-adjusted incidence rates and rates of curative treatment of prostate cancer increased significantly in all five regions of Norway since the early 1990s. There was a strong positive correlation between increasing incidence and increasing use of curative treatment. The frequency of curative treatment in Western Norway was almost threefold that in the Northern and Central regions around year 2000. Subsequently, the regional trends converged and only minor differences in prostate cancer incidence and use of curative treatment were observed by 2005. The declines in mortality were observed earliest in the regions with the highest incidence and the most frequent use of curative treatment, while the largest decreases in mortality were found in counties where the largest increases in curative treatment were observed. Conclusions: The elucidation of the prostate cancer mortality trends is hindered by an inability to tease out the potential effects of early treatment from the more general impact of improved and more active treatment. However, it is likely that both sets of intervention have contributed to the decline in prostate cancer mortality in Norway since 1996.",

We performed sensitivity analyses by varying death rate and population projections, and examined increase in YPLL from population growth, changes in demographics, and death rates.The number of YPLL caused by prostate cancer deaths was projected to increase by 226.1%, from 291,853 in 2004 to 951,753 in 2050. Hispanics were projected to have the fastest growth in YPLL (977.1% from 2004 to 2050) caused by prostate cancer, followed by non-Hispanic blacks (543.1%), and non-Hispanic others (269.7%). People aged 75 or older was projected to account for 62.0% of YPLL from prostate cancer in 2050 compared with 50.8% in 2004. Of the projected increase in YPLL caused by prostate cancer deaths by 2050, 9.8% were due to changes in demographic composition, 26.8% because of mortality change, and 63.4% because of population growth.YPLL due to prostate cancer deaths are projected to increase dramatically, and become a greater burden in the future.

     "abstract": "Aims: Our objective was to describe the geographical variation in cancer incidence using gastro-intestinal and non-melanoma skin cancer incidence data in Ireland using two different Bayesian spatial models and to compare the performance of these models. Methods: Cases diagnosed between 1994 and 2003 were extracted from the National Cancer Registry of Ireland. Population data were estimated from census data. For each of 3401 electoral divisions (EDs), relative risk (RR) estimates were calculated and smoothed using a conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and a spatial partition model introduced by Hegarty and Barry using a product partition model (PPM). The results were compared by mapping the ratio of the two RR estimates and other mainly descriptive statistics. Results: The two methods gave broadly similar results. For gastro-intestinal cancers the RRs were lower in a northwest/southeast band across the country with greater RRs around Dublin, Cork and in Donegal. Greater RR of non-melanoma skin cancer was observed in coastal areas. Median differences between the RR estimates were small (=0.01). The range of RRs was wider when estimated by the CAR model illustrating that the PPM smoothed the data to a greater extent than the CAR model. Conclusions: The two approaches gave similar results providing stronger evidence for the resulting geographical patterns. PPMs give a more global picture of the risk distribution whereas CAR models provide more local estimates. The observed patterns may reflect socio-demographic or geographic variations in risk factors or access to cancer services. By helping to identify those risks, these maps may help in the optimal allocation of scarce health resources.",

Methods: The SESI was tested on 220 consecutive subjects with pathologically confirmed PC at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston, TX.

The construct validity of the SESI was assessed with factor analysis by extracting and analyzing 5 principal components based on the subjects\u2019 individual responses on the assessment: county socioeconomic characteristics, individual socioeconomic characteristics, financial distress, increased domestic burden with limited earnings, and affluence. The internal consistency reliability of the SESI was assessed with Cronbach's alpha coefficients. Results: Based on the reviews of the SESI, all of the initial 10 items were retained. The correlations between individual responses on the SESI were similar to the results of previous studies. The 5 principal components that I assessed accounted for 71.5% of the variance. Factor loadings ranged from 0.66 to 0.98 and communalities ranged from 0.55 to 0.94. County socioeconomic characteristics accounted for 22.6% of the variance, whereas individual socioeconomic characteristics accounted for 14.6% of the variance.

Measures of effect and variability were extracted from 32 studies meeting specific inclusion criteria, and meta-analysis summary relative risk measures were calculated using random effects models and inverse variance weighting methods. Results: Meta-standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were, for cancer of the: oral cavity [1.02 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.77\u20131.34)]; esophagus [1.17 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.90\u20131.51)]; stomach [1.09 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.93\u20131.28)]; colon [0.89 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.70\u20131.12)]; and rectum [1.17 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.98\u20131.39)]. Analyses of more highly exposed subgroups included in the studies or subgroups based on geographic region or by industry with recognized Cr(VI) exposures (welding, chrome plating, chromate production, and pigment production) did not result in elevated meta-SMRs except for esophageal cancer among US cohorts [meta-SMR\u00a0=\u00a01.49 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.06\u20132.09)]. However, that finding was based on a subgroup of only four studies, one of which was a PMR study. Potential confounding by socioeconomic status (SES), diet and/or smoking, or limitations due to the healthy-worker effect (HWE) were evaluated, and while smoking, diet and SES may be important factors that may have upwardly biased the meta-SMRs, HWE is not likely to have significantly affected the summary results. None of three studies reporting small intestine cancers observed a statistically significant increased risk. Discussion: These meta-analyses and literature review indicate that Cr(VI)-exposed workers are not at a greater risk of GI cancers than the general population.",

Main outcome measures: Mortality from all-causes, all cancer and tobacco-related cancer. Results: The mortality risks associated with chewing (and 95% confidence intervals), after adjusting for age, sex, socio-economic and dietary variables, and for other habits, were 0.90 (0.86\u20130.94) for all-cause, 1.07 (0.94\u20131.22) for cancer and 1.22 (1.04\u20131.44) for tobacco-related cancer; with smoking the respective mortality risks were 1.31 (1.24\u20131.39), 1.63 (1.37\u20131.94) and 1.68 (1.36\u20132.08); and with alcohol use the risks were 1.13 (1.06\u20131.20), 1.32 (1.11\u20131.57) and 1.47 (1.19\u20131.80), respectively.

Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the possible effect of consanguinity on the risk of breast cancer in a population with a high rate of consanguinity and find the associated risk-modifying factors. Subjects and methods: The study included 167 Qatari and other Arab expatriates women with breast cancer and 341 age and ethnicity matched control women. A questionnaire that included the socio-demographic information, type of consanguinity, medical history, life style habits, dietary intake and tumor grade was designed to collect, the information of cases and controls. A total number of 214 breast cancer patients were approached and 167 cases completed the questionnaires with a response rate of 78%. Of the 417 healthy women who agreed to participate in this study, 341 responded to the questionnaire (81.8%). Results: The study revealed that the rate of parental consanguinity was lower in breast cancer patients (24%) than in controls (32.3%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.062).

Family history of breast cancer was significantly more often in breast cancer patients (14.4%) than in controls (6.2%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). However, the family history of breast cancer was more often positive in cases of non-consanguineous parents (15.7%) than cases of consanguineous parents (10.0%). Conclusion: The present study revealed the lack of association between of breast cancer and the parental consanguinity in Arab women residing in Qatar. The family history of breast cancer and the body mass index (BMI) are highly associated with breast cancer.",

Methods: A total of 1845 incident cases of NPC and 2275 matched controls from Guangdong, China were included in this study. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from logistic regression models adjusted for smoking, consumption of alcohol, salted fish consumption, and demographic factors. Results: A significant association between the risk of NPC and family history of any cancers in first degree relatives was observed, and higher number of affected family member was related to a higher risk (Ptrend\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Family history of NPC was the strongest predictor for NPC (OR: 3.35, 95% CI: 2.46\u20134.55 for all first degree relatives). The risk of NPC was also positively associated with history of head and neck cancer among parents and lung and breast cancers among siblings. The combination of family history of cancer, especially NPC, and the consumption of salt-preserved fish significantly increased the risk for NPC. Conclusions: These results confirm that the risk for NPC increases with family history of NPC and suggest that lung and breast cancer contribute to risk for NPC. A possible interaction between family history of cancer, especially NPC, and consumption of salt-preserved fish in the development of NPC was also identified.",

This study assessed the women's risk factors for breast cancer and predictive factors for the practice of breast examinations. The findings will be of help in enhancing early detection of the disease and reducing mortality from the disease. Methods: Utilizing a multi-stage sampling method, 420 women were selected at Akinyele Local government area of Ibadan. Data was collected with questionnaire. The risk factor was evaluated using the breast cancer risk assessment tool based on the Gail model. Six demographic factors, plus four covariates: knowledge of BSE/CBE, knowledge of the cause of, symptoms and signs of and treatment of breast cancer, were regressed against two dependent variables of practice of BSE and CBE using linear regression and binary logistic analyses respectively. Results: Only 386 questionnaires properly filled were analyzed. The mean age of respondents was 37.3 (SD\u00a0=\u00a013.1) years. They were of low educational status and were mostly traders and married. Only 190 of the women fulfilled the criteria for assessment with the Gail model. Most of the women, 180 (94.7%), had five years and 184 (96.8%) had lifetime risks lower than that of the average woman of the same age. Four significant predictors of BSE were marital status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), educational status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018), knowledge of treatment of breast cancer (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) and knowledge of BSE/CBE (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) while no formal education status and being a farmer were the only significant predictors of CBE.

The screening sensitivities, transition probabilities and sojourn time distributions are estimated for females aged 40\u201349 years and 50\u201359 years separately, using the Canadian National Breast Screening Study (CNBSS) data. The purpose is to estimate the lead time distribution and the probability of not detecting the cancer early. Approach: Within the 40\u201349-year-old and 50\u201359-year-old cohorts separately, the age-independent statistical model was applied. Bayesian estimators along with 95% highest probability density (HPD) credible intervals (CI) were calculated. Bayesian hypothesis testing was used to compare the parameter estimates of the two cohorts. The lead time density was also estimated for both the 40\u201349 and 50\u201359-year-old cohorts. Results: The screening sensitivity, transition probability of the disease, and mean sojourn time were all found to increase with age. For the 40\u201349-year-old and 50\u201359-year-old cohorts, the posterior mean sensitivities were 0.70 (95% HPD-CI: 0.46, 0.93) and 0.77 (0.61, 0.93), respectively. The posterior mean transition probabilities were 0.0023 (0.0018, 0.0027) and 0.0031 (0.0024, 0.0038), while the posterior mean sojourn times were 2.55 (1.56, 4.26) years and 3.15 (2.12, 4.96) years. Bayes factors for the ratio of posterior probabilities that the respective parameter was larger vs. smaller in the 50\u201359-year-old cohort were estimated to be 2.09, 40.8 and 3.0 for the sensitivity, transition probability, and mean sojourn time, respectively. All three Bayes factors were larger than two, indicating greater than 2:1 odds in favor of the hypothesis that each of these parameters was greater in the 50\u201359-year-old cohort. The estimated mean lead times were 0.83 years and 0.96 years if the two cohorts were screened annually. Conclusions: The increase in sensitivity corresponds to an increase in the mean sojourn time. Breast cancer in younger women is more difficult to detect by screening tests and is more aggressive than breast cancer in older women. Women aged 50\u201359 tend to benefit more from screening compared with women aged 40\u201349.",

News coverage shapes perceptions of cancer control in meaningful ways, but there is little consensus as to the impact of news on our understanding of and engagement in cancer screening practices. Our analysis of cancer screening-related print news coverage during a four month period in 2005 suggests that the newsworthiness of new screening technologies may undermine public confidence in currently available and effective secondary prevention programs, while promoting tests whose effectiveness is debated or not yet established. Methods and results: We conducted a structured text analysis of 517 cancer-related news articles from 15 leading daily newspapers and a subsequent qualitative analysis of the 79 screening news articles. Screening articles were analyzed for content related to criteria for screening effectiveness. Content patterns for each type of screening and cancer were also noted. News coverage consistently conveyed screening as important and highlighted the need to protect and expand access to screening. At the same time, to the extent that story content was framed by the newsworthiness of new tests and technologies this often indirectly called into question effective and established protocols and programs without providing any actionable alternative. Conclusion: This analysis revealed unexpected messages about screening that are potentially problematic for cancer control. The cancer control community should continue efforts to understand and shape news coverage of screening in order to promote balanced and action-oriented content. Research has shown that Americans hold conflicting views regarding cancer\u2014having a favorable opinion of screening while simultaneously feeling fatalistic about prevention. Our analysis of print news stories on cancer screening suggests that the determination of screening's \u201cnewsworthiness\u201d is related to newly developed tests and protocols, which may create demand for new tests whose effectiveness is unknown and undermine confidence in established and effective screening programs.",

     "abstract": "Background: The incidence of breast cancer has been on the rise in Malaysia. It is suggested that a subset of breast cancer cases were associated with germline mutation in breast cancer susceptibility (BRCA) genes. Most of the BRCA mutations reported in Malaysia were point mutations, small deletions and insertions. Here we report the first study of BRCA large genomic rearrangements (LGRs) in Malaysia. We aimed to detect the presence of LGRs in the BRCA genes of Malaysian patients with breast cancer. Methods: Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) for BRCA LGRs was carried out on 100 patients (60 were high-risk breast cancer patients previously tested negative/positive for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, and 40 were sporadic breast cancer patients), recruited from three major referral centres, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC), Hospital Kuala Lumpur (HKL) and Hospital Putrajaya (HPJ). Results: Two novel BRCA1 rearrangements were detected in patients with sporadic breast cancer; both results were confirmed by quantitative PCR. No LGRs were found in patients with high-risk breast cancer. The two large genomic rearrangements detected were genomic amplifications of exon 3 and exon 10. No BRCA2 genomic rearrangement was found in both high-risk and sporadic breast cancer patients. Conclusion: These results will be helpful to understand the mutation spectrum of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in Malaysian patients with breast cancer. Further studies involving larger samples are required to establish a genetic screening strategy for both high-risk and sporadic breast cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "Background: The mouse double minute 2 (MDM2) gene represents one of the central nodes in the p53 pathway. A naturally occurring T/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the intronic promoter of MDM2, SNP309 (rs2279744), was shown to influence MDM2 expression and p53 activity. SNP in the promoter region of MDM2 gene has recently been shown to be associated with accelerated tumor formation in both hereditary and sporadic cancers in humans. In this study, we aim to evaluate the association of SNP309 with the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development among Turkish population. Methods: MDM2 SNP309 polymorphism was investigated in 110 confirmed subjects with HCC and 110 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking and alcohol consumption by using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Results: The allele frequencies of case subjects (T, 0.48; G, 0.52) were significantly different from those of control subjects (T, 0.65; G, 0.35) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). The proportion of GG genotype of the SNP309 in patients with HCC (26%) was significantly higher than that in patients without HCC (14%). We observed that compared with the TT genotype, the genotypes containing G allele [TG (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.18\u20134.07; p\u00a0=\u00a00.013) or GG (OR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.65\u20138.00; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001)] were associated with significant increased susceptibility to HCC.

     "abstract": "Purpose: Touch imprint cytology (TIC) facilitates rapid diagnosis of breast diseases in women attending triple assessment clinics. Some pathologists, in our centre, feel that pathological interpretation of TIC slides is contentious when the lesions are radiologically indeterminate (R3), as these can lead to potentially higher false positive or false negative cytology results. We hypothesised that: \u2018(R3) lesions are more likely to have higher false positive or false negative TIC and/or be inadequate for TIC assessment\u2019. In other words, \u2018imaging influences cytological classification especially when indeterminate\u2019. Methods: Review of the data collected in our centre between December 2003 and July 2005. All patients who attended the one stop symptomatic breast clinic and had a TIC performed following an ultrasound (US) guided core biopsy (CB) were included. Demographic, radiological, cytological and core biopsy grading data were collected. Cytology grading was correlated with radiology classification to assess our hypothesis. Results: A total of 248 patients underwent 254 CB/TIC. The average patient's age of the group was 54 years (range of 29\u201395). On TIC, 186 (73%) were deemed malignant, 23(9%) benign while 33(13%) were inadequate for assessment. There was no false positive or false negative TIC. There was good correlation between TIC and CB results (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Thirty-three cases were inadequate (C1) for cytology assessment, of these16 (48.5%) were indeterminate on imaging. R3 lesions were 6 times more prone to have C1 cytology (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Conclusion: Touch imprint cytology is a reliable and efficient method in running a one stop breast clinic, with the backup of full tissue diagnosis. Careful selection of cases that would benefit from this technique is highly recommended as a significant number of radiologically indeterminate lesions are likely to be insufficient for cytological assessment. Further prospective trials are required to assess this further. Until then the diagnosis in this sub-group should depend on core biopsy.",

     "abstract": "Background: The purpose of our study was to show the distinction between the apoptotic and anti-proliferative signaling of phytosterols and cholesterol-enrichment in prostate cancer cell lines, mediated by the differential transcription of caveolin-1, and N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), a pro-apoptotic androgen-regulated tumor suppressor. Methods: PC-3 and DU145 cells were treated with sterols (cholesterol and phytosterols) for 72\u00a0h, followed by trypan blue dye-exclusion measurement of necrosis and cell growth measured with a Coulter counter. Sterol induction of cell growth-suppressor gene expression was evaluated by mRNA transcription using RT-PCR, while cell cycle analysis was performed by FACS analysis. Altered expression of Ndrg1 protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis. Apoptosis was evaluated by real time RT-PCR amplification of P53, Bcl-2 gene and its related pro- and anti-apoptotic family members. Results: Physiological doses (16\u00a0\u03bcM) of cholesterol and phytosterols were not cytotoxic in these cells. Cholesterol-enrichment promoted cell growth (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while phytosterols significantly induced growth-suppression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis showed that contrary to cholesterol, phytosterols decreased mitotic subpopulations. We demonstrated for the first time that cholesterols concertedly attenuated the expression of caveolin-1 (cav-1) and NDRG1 genes in both prostate cancer cell lines. Phytosterols had the opposite effect by inducing overexpression of cav-1, a known mediator of androgen-dependent signals that presumably control cell growth or apoptosis. Conclusions: Cholesterol and phytosterol treatment differentially regulated the growth of prostate cancer cells and the expression of p53 and cav-1, a gene that regulates androgen-regulated signals. These sterols also differentially regulated cell cycle arrest, downstream pro-apoptotic androgen-regulated tumor suppressor, NDRG1 suggesting that cav-1 may mediate pro-apoptotic NDRG1 signals. Elucidation of the mechanism for sterol modulation of growth and apoptosis signaling may reveal potential targets for cancer prevention and/or chemotherapeutic intervention. Sterol regulation of NDRG1 transcription suggests its potential as biomarker for prediction of neoplasms that would be responsive to chemoprevention by phytosterols.",

     "abstract": "Background: Chromosomal aberrations and instability of gene(s) are two factors related to the genetic instability of cancer cells. A loss of the tumor-suppressor function of the genes p16 and p53 is the most common event leading to the development of human cancers. Carcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world. Chromosomal abnormalities in lung cancer may provide a valuable clue to the identification of target loci and culminate in a successful search for the major genes. The aim of this study was to investigate (i) alterations of the p16 and p53 genes and (ii) chromosomal aberrations in patients with small cell and non-small cell lung cancer by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and cytogenetic studies. Methods: We carried out cytogenetic analysis by Giemsa-banding in 18 cases. FISH probes for the p16 and p53 genes were also used on interphase nuclei to screen the alterations in these genes in lung cancer (LC).Results: We observed a high frequency of losses of the p16 \u2013 in 8/18 (44%) \u2013 and p53 \u2013 in 7/18 (39%) \u2013 genes in the cases with LC. A total of 18 patients showed predominantly numerical and structural aberrations. Among these two types, structural aberrations predominated and usually consisted of deletions, breaks, and fragilities in various chromosomes. Both structural and numerical changes were observed in almost all patients. Chromosomes 3 and 1 were found to be most frequently involved in structural abnormalities, followed by chromosomes 6, 9, and 8. Autosomal aneuploidies were also observed to be the most frequent (chromosomes 22, 19, 18, 20, 9, and 17), followed by those of the X and Y chromosomes. The expression of fragile sites was also found to be significantly higher in seven chromosomal regions: 3p14, 1q21, 1q12, 6q26, 9q13, 8q22, and 8q24. Conclusion: Our data confirmed that DNA damage and genomic instability may be factors contributing to the mutation profile and development of lung cancer. The patients who developed lung cancer showed a high frequency of loss of both p16 and p53, in addition to chromosomal aberrations. Tobacco could be a major carcinogenic factor in lung-cancer progression. The loss of p16 and p53, and increased incidence of autosomal aneuploidy and chromatid breaks, along with other chromosomal alterations, can contribute to the progression of the disease.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of EMMPRIN in human primary bladder cancer and to evaluate its prognostic value. Methods: EMMPRIN expression patterns were detected by immunohistochemistry. In order to determine its prognostic value, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and multivariate analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazard analysis. Results: Of the 101 cases with bladder cancers, 68 (67.3%) cases were positive for EMMPRIN expression. When categorized into negative vs. positive expression, EMMPRIN was associated with the stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), the grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), carcinoma in situ (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), the recurrence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), the progression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), and the death (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) of patients with bladder cancer. Moreover, positive EMMPRIN expression clearly predicted poorer PFS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and OS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). In the multivariate analysis, positive EMMPRIN expression was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and OS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Conclusion: EMMPRIN expression was greater in bladder cancers than in the adjacent normal tissues and may be a useful prognostic marker for patients with bladder cancer.",

Methods: We linked 2298 incident NSCLC cases, identified by the Piedmont Cancer Registry of Turin (PCRT) with administrative health records to identify the initial pattern of care. Because stage of disease strongly influences pattern of care and prognosis of NSCLC, all the analyses were stratified according to stage (early and advanced). The association between the set of patient's characteristics and the probability of accessing a specific pattern of care was analysed with a multivariable multinomial logistic regression model. Survival was analysed with the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: In the early stage group, presence of comorbidities, older age and low educational level were all associated with a lower probability of receiving surgery. These same factors, as well as being unmarried, were associated with higher probability of receiving other non-curative care only. The effects of comorbidities and low educational level as barriers to receiving more effective patterns of care were not relevant in the advanced stage group. When controlling for initial patterns of care, in the early stage group, an age older than 75 years and being unmarried were negative prognostic factors, while survival was completely independent from educational level. Among patients with an advanced stage of disease, only comorbidities had a negative impact on survival. Conclusion: Appropriate lung cancer care is affected by sociodemographic factors. Greater attention to social and health programs is recommended to improve the timeliness of diagnosis, the staging of potentially resectable patients, and to implement more comprehensive multidisciplinary evaluations of those who may benefit from curative treatments.",

     "abstract": "Background: Chaperones play an important role in inducing anti-cancer immunity. To explore the probability of using chaperone-peptide-rich complexes extracted from colo-carcinoma cells as anti-cancer vaccine, we extracted and prepared chaperone-peptide-rich complexes from CT26 cells, which were subsequently investigated on anti-cancer efficacy. Methods: The crude extracts of the CT26 cells treated with heat and Trichosanthin were precipitated with salt and dialyzed to remove proteins below 50\u00a0kDa and above 300\u00a0kDa in molecular weight; the proteins with the molecular weights in 70\u00a0kDa, 90\u00a0kDa, 95\u00a0kDa, 110\u00a0kDa and 170\u00a0kDa were collected through gel filtration and SDS-PAGE. After confirmation, the purified proteins were used to determine their effects on lymphocyte proliferation, the activities of NK and CTL, tumor suppression and the tumor-bearing mouse survival. Results: The majority of the chaperone-peptides of anti-cancer immunity in CT26 cells, including HSP70-antigen peptide, HSP90-antigen peptide, gp96-antigen peptide, HSP-110 antigen peptide, HSP170-antigen peptide, was satisfactorily extracted that the multi-chaperone-peptide-rich mixtures were obtained. All the mixtures prepared could elicit lymphocyte proliferation, enhance the activities of CTL and NK, reinforce the tumor suppression and prolong the mouse survival. Conclusions: The multi-chaperone-peptide-rich mixtures could be prepared via dialysis and gel filtration combining with SDS-PAGE. Both the heat stress and Trichosanthin could induce and increase the mixtures, of which that treated by 42\u00a0\u00b0C heat and Trichosanthin was found to possess the strongest anti-cancer efficacy.",

     "abstract": "Population-based cancer registries (PBCRs) are instruments to provide cancer incidence to promote cancer control and etiological research. A setting of mandatory (standard) variables is routinely collected for patient and tumor. One recommended variable is tumor stage, which supplies information on disease status and is an essential prognostic factor. However, it is not considered as necessary information to be collected by the PBCR. There are studies showing the value of stage as a prognostic variable to evaluate survival, socio-economic status, race and ethnics differences. Our aim is to analyze the feasibility of PBCRs in abstracting TNM for oral cavity and oropharynx. These topographies were selected due to the clinical accessibility of stage tumors by visual inspection and palpation. About 23% of the PBCRs who contributed to CI5-IX indicated their collection of TNM stage for all cancer sites. We analyzed 23,935 cases of oral cavity (OCC) and oropharynx cancer (OPC) from 13 PBCRs. Complete TNM stage for OCC was 52.7% for males and 47.6% for females; for OPC, it was 56% in both genders. Incomplete stage on OCC and OPC ranged from 22 to 25%. Missing was about 18\u201327% (most common in oral cavity). Missing stage was significantly higher in males for OCC aged \u226570 years, OR 1,64 (1.39\u20131.94). Our results demonstrate that OPC tend to have more stage, when compared with OCC. Even if it can be diagnosed by visual inspection, these results highlight the fact that information on stage can be a reliable indicator of access to healthcare and diagnosis awareness. Our results demonstrate that is feasible for PBCR to collect stage, although improving completeness of this information needs further technical training and international recommendation to adopt TNM stage as a standard variable for the PBCRs.",

Methods: Crude, age-standardized rates (ASRs), and age-specific rates per 100,000 population were calculated and results were compared with estimates from Western, regional, and Arab countries. Results: Breast cancer constituted about 38.2% of all cancer cases among Lebanese females in the year 2004. The median age at diagnosis was 52.5 years. The age-standardized incidence rate per 100,000 was estimated at 71.0.

While the incidence is generally higher in men than in women, little has been reported on ethnic differences. We examine trends in RCC incidence and mortality rates among Israeli Arab and Jewish populations and compared with the rates in other countries. Methods: Age-adjusted RCC incidence and mortality rates in Israel, during 1980\u20132004, were calculated by sex and population group, using the National Cancer Registry. They were compared with the United States based on the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results [SEER] program and the IARC database for international comparisons. Results: While RCC incidence rates in Israel are similar to the United States and the European average, the rates are significantly higher among Israeli Jews than Arabs. Men are affected more than women. Incidence rates over the last 24 years have increased among all men and Jewish women, but not among Arab women. Among men, the incidence rate ratio for Jews to Arabs declined from 3.96 in 1980\u20131982 to 2.34 in 2001\u20132004, whereas for women there was no change. The mortality rates were higher among Jews than Arab and among men than women. There were no significant change in the mortality rates and rate ratios. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate marked ethnic differences in RCC in Israel. The lower incidence among Arabs stands in contrast to the higher prevalence of potential risk factors for RCC in this population group. Genetic factors, diet and other lifestyle factors could play protective roles.",

Methods: Using data from the Eastern Cancer Registration and Information Centre, we examined the time trends and the effect of age, period of diagnosis and birth cohort on the incidence of colorectal cancer by sex and subsite. Results: Between 1971 and 2005, 23\u00a0875 males and 22\u00a0651 females were registered with colorectal cancer in East Anglia. During this period, the increase in the incidence trends was higher among males, more recent periods of diagnosis, and proximal colon. Cohort effects were statistically significant in distal and rectal cancers in males (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.05, respectively), and in proximal colon in females (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Period effects were statistically significant across all subsites and both sexes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for all). Conclusions: Period effects were significant across all subsites for both sexes, whereas cohort effects varied in their significance levels depending on subsite and sex. We suggest that the period effect may be due to an increase in the use of colonoscopy for diagnostic or opportunistic screening, and the cohort effect may be due to aetiological differences in CRC between sexes and subsites.",

     "publication date": "06-2010",
     "abstract": "Background: A recent decline in breast cancer incidence rates has been reported in the United States and in Europe. This decrease has been partly attributed to the reduced use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). No study in Europe has detailed recent breast cancer incidence trends both by hormonal receptor status and mode of detection at an individual level. Methods: We examined trends in breast cancer incidence rates in the French administrative area of Loire-Atlantique between 1991 and 2007, by age, mode of detection, histological subtype, estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status and grade. Annual age-standardized breast cancer incidence rates were estimated using the Loire-Atlantique and Vend\u00e9e Cancer Registry data. Annual percentage changes (APCs) were estimated using an age-adjusted Poisson regression model. Results: Incidence rates of breast cancer increased 3.5% per year in 1991\u20132003, dropped \u22124.3% per year in 2003\u20132006 and increased in 2007 (9.1%). Stratified analyses by age groups showed that the decrease concerned predominantly women aged 50\u201364 years, whereas an increasing proportion of cancers detected by organized screening was observed in this age group. Among these women, the decline of incidence particularly concerned positive estrogen and progesterone receptor tumors, lobular subtype tumors, and low-grade tumors. Conclusion: The drop in breast cancer incidence rates observed between 2003 and 2006 in women 50\u201364 years old was greater for ER+PR+ tumors. During the same period, the incidence of breast cancers diagnosed by organized screening increased. These patterns appear consistent with an impact of the reduced use of HRT.",

Methods: A Bayesian age\u2013drift model has been fitted to describe trends. Projections for 2005\u20132019 have been calculated by means of an autoregressive APC model. Prior precision for these parameters has been selected through evaluation of an adaptive precision parameter and 95% credible intervals (95% CRI) have been obtained for each model parameter. Results: A decrease of \u22122.41% (95% CRI: \u22123.65%; \u22121.13%) per year has been found for TC mortality rates in age groups 15\u201374 during 1985\u20132004, whereas mortality showed a lower annual decrease when data was restricted to age groups 15\u201354 (\u22121.18%; 95% CRI: \u22122.60%; \u22120.31%). During 2005\u20132019 is expected a decrease of TC mortality of 2.30% per year for men younger than 35, whereas a leveling off for TC mortality rates is expected for men older than 35. Conclusions: A Bayesian approach should be recommended to describe and project time trends for those diseases with low number of cases. Through this model it has been assessed that management of TC and advances in therapy led to decreasing trend of TC mortality during the period 1985\u20132004, whereas a leveling off for these trends can be considered during 2005\u20132019 among men older than 35.",

Methods: Death certificates of 3209 PWA diagnosed in 1999\u20132006 who died as of December 2006 were reviewed to identify those deaths in which KS or NHL was the underlying cause. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were computed. Results: KS or NHL appeared in 4.3% and 14.6% death certificates, respectively; they were the underlying cause of death in 3.1% and 13.4% of cases. SMR were 8698-fold higher for KS and 349-fold higher for NHL, and tended to decline over the study period. Conclusion: KS and NHL caused about 16% of deaths of PWA in the HAART era, with 100-fold higher risks of death compared to the Italian general population also in recent years. Clinicians and public health officials should be aware of the persisting negative impact of these cancers on life expectancy of PWA.",

From the Regional South Swedish Tumour Registry, which is of documented high quality, 24 patients out of 8008 with reported melanoma diagnosis 1973\u20132003 were reported as having multiple (\u22653) primary, invasive cutaneous malignant melanomas (CMM). Of the 76 tumours identified in these patients, 7 (9%) were found not to be invasive melanomas. Additional cases could be put into question since the lesions could be interpreted as epidermotropic metastases, a diagnosis which can be difficult to establish reliably by microscopic examination. Among the 24 patients we could also identify 8 (10%) additional lesions representing invasive CMM, not included in the Tumour Registry database. Thorough information concerning an earlier melanoma diagnosis and its site of presentation is needed from the clinician and the pathologist for optimal assessment of the histology and the prognostication of the patient, as well as proper reporting to a tumour registry. Identifying multiple primary malignant melanomas is also of special importance for counselling patients belonging to families with hereditary disease. In this study it is shown that diagnosing and reporting multiple malignant melanomas can be problematic due to insufficient communication and to the rare and deceptive capability of cutaneous metastases to imitate primary tumours.",

Methods: We conducted a case\u2013control study in women aged 30\u201364 years in selected health care facilities in the Western province. A total of 100 recent cases of breast cancer (histologically confirmed) and 203 controls (age and parity matched) were included. Detailed information regarding breastfeeding, menstruation, reproductive factors, passive smoking and other confounders was collected using a structured questionnaire. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using multiple logistic regressions. Principle results: Multivariate analysis found that those women who breastfed for \u226524 months during lifetime had significantly lower risk of breast cancer than those who breastfed for less than 24 months (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.40; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.22, 0.73). Compared to 0\u201311 months of lifetime breastfeeding, there was a 66.3% reduction in breast cancer risk in women who breastfed for 12\u201323 months, 87.4% reduction in 24\u201335 months and 94% reduction in 36\u201347 months categories.

Therefore, we investigated the effect of definitive therapy with radiation therapy (external beam radiation therapy [EBRT] or brachytherapy) on acute myeloid leukemia incidence in a population-based cohort of patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer. Methods: We utilized the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database to identify a cohort of men (n\u00a0=\u00a0168,612) with newly diagnosed prostate adenocarcinoma between January 1988 and December 2003. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of acute myeloid leukemia incidence following definitive therapy with EBRT alone, brachytherapy alone, or surgery alone compared to no definitive therapy (i.e. no EBRT, brachytherapy, or surgery). Results: The cohort yielded 184 acute myeloid leukemia cases during 1,064,820 person-years of follow-up after prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosis. Patients treated with EBRT had a higher adjusted relative risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia than patients treated with brachytherapy or surgery when each therapy group was compared to patients who were not treated with definitive therapy (EBRT: HR\u00a0=\u00a02.05, 95% CI 1.29, 3.26; brachytherapy: HR\u00a0=\u00a01.22, 95% CI 0.46, 3.22; surgery: HR\u00a0=\u00a01.24, 95% CI 0.77, 1.98).

Methods: Our case\u2013control study examined samples from 914 cancer deaths and their 2739 matched controls within the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study. Blood samples were obtained at the baseline and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until analysis for IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 levels. The conditional logistic model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for cancer mortality associated with these serum levels. Results: The adjusted ORs for IGF-I quartiles ranged from 0.81 to 0.96 but were not significant. The adjusted ORs and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the second, third, and fourth IGF-II quartiles were 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52\u20130.79), 0.71 (95% CI: 0.58\u20130.88), and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59\u20130.91), respectively, while those for the respective IGFBP-3 quartiles were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.63\u20130.96), 0.75 (95% CI: 0.60\u20130.94), and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.56\u20130.90). In the model of IGF-I, and IGF-II additionally adjusted for IGFBP-3, the associations of high IGFs levels were similar as observed in the above models, while the association of IGFBP-3 shifted into non-significance after adjusting for IGF-II. Conclusion: An increased level of IGF-II was significantly associated with decreased risk of cancer mortality, whereas the association between IGF-I and all cancer mortality was not significant. The inverse association of IGFBP-3 level with all cancer mortality was affected when adjusting for IGF-II levels, shifting from significant to non-significant. Confirmation of these results from further cohort studies may aid in identifying the potential association between these molecules and the risk of cancer among the general Japanese population.",

Glutathione-S-Transferases (GSTs) are phase-II enzymes playing role in detoxification of carcinogen electrophiles. Genetic polymorphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 in association with some environmental factors and their impact on esophageal cancer susceptibility were assessed in the Iranian population. Methods: Genomic DNA of peripheral blood leukocytes from 148 confirmed esophageal cancer cases and 137 healthy individuals as control group was assayed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the GSTP1 loci by PCR amplification followed by digestion with Alw26I. Deletion of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes was detected by multiplex PCR. A data-mining method based on decision trees was applied to produce a predictive model of interactions between genotypes.

Methods We conducted a population-based case\u2013control study that included 1163 cases and 1501 controls to examine whether individuals who carry genetic variants associated with lower lipid absorption have a higher risk of colorectal cancer. Using Taqman assay, we determined FABP2 alanine (A)/threonine (T) polymorphism at codon 54 in exon-2 and APOE isoforms. Multivariable odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by unconditional logistic regression models, assuming FABP2 A54 and APO non-E4 as high risk alleles. Results We found no associations with either of the polymorphisms. The OR associated with FABP2 A54 homozygotes compared with the others was 1.01 (95% CI; 0.86\u20131.45) and that for non-ApoE4 carriers compared with carries was 0.95 (95% CI; 0.80\u20131.13). However, there was a statistically significant negative interaction between total fat intake and FABP2 AA genotypes (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), indicating that the risk of colorectal cancer associated with this polymorphism is higher in the subjects with lower fat intake.

     "abstract": "Background: A common G to A polymorphism (G870A) in the splice donor region of exon 4 of cyclin D1 (CCND1) gene generates two mRNAs (cyclin D1a and D1b) through an alternative splicing at the site of this polymorphism. Cyclin D1a and b proteins differ in their COOH-terminus, a region involved in protein degradation. We examined the association between this CCDN1 genotype and the susceptibility to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a Turkish population. Methods: The genotype frequency of this polymorphism was determined by using a polymerase chain reaction\u2013restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR\u2013RFLP) assay. Hospital-based case\u2013control study was designed consisting of 160 diagnosis subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma and 160 cancer-free control subjects matched on age, gender, smoking and alcohol status. Results: The allele frequencies of case subjects (A, 0.55; G, 0.45) were significantly different from those of control subjects (A, 0.42; G, 0.58) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). The odds ratios (ORs) for the CCND1 870 GA and AA genotypes when compared with the GG genotypes were 1.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82\u20132.36, p\u00a0=\u00a00.22) and 2.52 (95% CI 1.38\u20134.62, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) respectively. The presence of at least one CCND1 870A allele was associated with increased risk for HCC (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.06\u20132.82, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). When combining the GG and GA genotypes as a reference genotype, we found that the OR for the AA genotype was 2.06 (95% CI 1.24\u20133.44, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Conclusion: Our results suggest that the CCND1 G870A single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of HCC in our Turkish population.",

     "abstract": "Background: Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are at an increased risk of developing secondary malignant neoplasms. Radiation and chemotherapy can cause mutations and cytogenetic abnormalities and induce genomic instability. Host immunity and appropriate DNA damage responses are critical inhibitors of carcinogenesis. Therefore, we sought to determine the long-term effects of ALL treatment on immune function and response to DNA damage. Methods: Comparative studies on 14 survivors in first complete remission and 16 siblings were conducted. Results: In comparison to siblings on the cells that were involved in adaptive immunity, the patients had either higher numbers (CD19+ B cells and CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells) or similar numbers (\u03b1\u03b2T cells and CD45RO+/RA\u2212 memory T cells) in the blood. In contrast, patients had lower numbers of all lymphocyte subsets involved in innate immunity (\u03b3\u03b4T cells and all NK subsets, including KIR2DL1+ cells, KIR2DL2/L3+ cells, and CD16+ cells), and lower natural cytotoxicity against K562 leukemia cells. Thymopoiesis was lower in patients, as demonstrated by less CD45RO\u2212/RA+ na\u00efve T cell and less SjTREC levels in the blood, whereas the V\u03b2 spectratype complexity score was similar. Array of gene expression response to low-dose radiation showed that about 70% of the probesets had a reduced response in patients. One of these genes, SCHIP-1, was also among the top-ranked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) during the whole-genome scanning by SNP microarray analysis. Conclusion: ALL survivors were deficient in innate immunity, thymopoiesis, and DNA damage responses to radiation. These defects may contribute to their increased likelihood of second malignancy.",

     "abstract": "Background: Although the literature on factors associated with mammography screening is abundant, reasons for underparticipation remain unclear, most studies having focused exclusively on individual factors. This study aimed at investigating the ecological influence of socioeconomic status and healthcare supply on compliance to organized breast cancer screening programs, on an unbiased sample based on data from the entire target population within a French geographical area, Calvados (n\u00a0=\u00a098,822 women). Methods: Individual data on participation and aggregate data on healthcare supply and socioeconomic status, respectively obtained from the structure responsible for organizing screening and the French census, were analyzed simultaneously using a multilevel model. Results: Uptake was lower among the youngest (50\u201354 years) and the oldest (70\u201374 years) women, compared to the intermediate 55\u201369 year age-group, with respectively OR\u00a0=\u00a00.73 (95%CI: 0.64\u20130.83) and OR\u00a0=\u00a00.78 (95%CI: 0.67\u20130.91). Uptake fell with increasing level of deprivation, a difference in uptake probability being observed between the least deprived and the most deprived areas (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.71; 95%CI: 0.59\u20130.86). Neither radiologist- nor primary care physicians-to-100,000 inhabitants ratios were associated with participation. Conclusions: Multilevel analysis allows to detect areas of weak participation statistically linked to areas of strong deprivation. So, even with organized breast cancer screening giving screening free of charge for target women, ecological socioeconomic factors have a more significant impact on participation than healthcare supply. These results suggest that targeting populations, in accurate geographical areas where women are less likely to participate, as identified socially and geographically in this study, could be adopted to reduce disparities in screening.",

There are conflicting data regarding the roles of these molecules in prostate cancer. To elucidate the prognostic impact of these proteins and provide information on prognosis and treatment, we compared the expression of COX-2, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-10 in prostate cancer specimens with or without metastases. Ki67 was included as a measure of growth fraction of tumor cells. Methods: Digital video analysis images from tumor cell areas and tumor stromal areas were analyzed on formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded and immunohistochemical stained cancer specimens from 59 patients: 32 patients with metastases and 27 patients without clinical, biochemical, or radiological evidence of metastases within 10 years after diagnosis. The expression of COX-2 was scored as negative, weak, moderate, or strong. The expressions of TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 were assessed as proportions of moderately or strongly stained cells. Ki67 was detected as strong nuclear staining in proliferating cells. Results: In primary cancers in the metastatic group, COX-2, TGF-\u03b2 and Ki67 were stronger expressed in epithelial tumor cell and tumor stromal areas compared with non-metastatic cancers (for all markers, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). High intensity of COX-2 staining in tumor areas was strongly associated with death from prostate cancer in univariate analyses (hazard ratio [HR] 95% CI, 4.0 (1.1\u201314.5)). In multivariate analyses, the risk estimate was strengthened but did not reach significance. No associations to death were found for the other markers. Conclusion: High expression of COX-2, TGF-\u03b2 and Ki67 were in metastatic primary prostate carcinoma compared to non-metastatic cancers. High expression of COX-2 was associated to death from prostate carcinoma.",

To clarify the role of genetic instability in the progression from gastric dysplasia to gastric cancer, mitochondrial microsatellite instability (mtMSI) was studied in gastric cancer and gastric dysplasia. Methods: DNA was isolated from paired normal and tumoral tissues in 24 patients with gastric dysplasia (low grade) and 49 patients with gastric cancer. mtMSI was analyzed using eight microsatellite markers. mtMSI in gastric dysplasia was studied prospectively to elucidate the relation between mtMSI and gastric carcinogenesis. Results: mtMSI was found in 5 (10.2%) of 49 gastric cancer patients. The mtMSI phenotype was not associated with age, gender, and Helicobacter pylori infection. However, all of the mtMSI was found in intestinal-type gastric cancer (20.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In gastric dysplasia, mtMSI was detected in 3 (12.5%) of 24 patients with gastric dysplasia. mtMSI-positive gastric dysplasia showed a poor prognosis statistically compared to mtMSI negative through progression to high-grade dysplasia or gastric cancer. Conclusions: These data suggest that mtMSI may be an early and important event in the progression of gastric carcinogenesis, especially in intestinal-type gastric cancer.",

The environmental and reproductive risk factors that influence these hormones are well known, however, genetic variants involved in hormone biosynthesis and estrogen metabolism have not been well established in endometrial cancer. Methods: To determine whether polymorphisms in genes of the steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism pathways are associated with endometrial cancer risk, 28 polymorphisms in 18 genes were genotyped in 191 endometrial cancer cases and 291 healthy controls. Results: The GSTM1 deletion and the variant (GG) genotype of the CYP1B1 rs1800440 polymorphism were associated with a decreased risk of developing endometrial cancer. Furthermore, combinations of haplotypes in CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and GSTs were associated with a decreased risk. The analysis of the repeat polymorphisms revealed that women with the long repeat allele length of the ESR1 (GT)n repeat polymorphism were at an increased risk of developing endometrial cancer. Conversely, women with two long repeat length alleles of the (CAG)n repeat polymorphism in the AR correlated with a decrease in endometrial cancer risk compared to women with one or two alleles with the short repeat length. Conclusions: The findings are consistent with our hypothesis that variability in genes involved in steroidogenesis and estrogen metabolism may alter the risk of developing endometrial cancer, suggesting that they may be useful as biomarkers for genetic susceptibility to endometrial cancer.",

The mechanisms underlying CIMP in sporadic colorectal cancer are poorly understood. Genes involved in methyl-group metabolism are likely to affect DNA methylation and thereby influence an individual's risk of CIMP. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether polymorphisms in the genes encoding methyl-group metabolism pathway predispose to CIMP+ and/or CIMP\u2212 CRC. Methods: We examined the potential association between the polymorphisms of MTHFR 677C>T, TS 5\u2032UTR 2R/3R, TS 3\u2032UTR 1494del6, \u0394DNMT3B \u2212149C>T and DNMT3B \u2212283T>C in a group of 46 CIMP+ CRC cases, 140 CIMP\u2212 CRC cases and 140 healthy controls. The CIMP status of the CRC cases was determined by MS-PCR in tumor tissue by a panel of five markers (CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3 and SOCS1), which was also followed by analyzing hMLH1 methylation and BRAF V600E mutation. Results: The variant allele homozygote genotype for the \u0394DNMT3B \u2212283T>C polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk for CIMP+ CRC (OR: 0.31, 95%CI: 0.09\u20130.73, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009).

Glucuronidation, mediated by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) enzyme, is a main metabolic pathway of estrogen detoxification in steroid target tissues, such as the prostate. The aim of our study was to investigate the possible correlation between UGT1A1 promoter gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer risk. Patients and methods: 129 patients with prostate cancer and 260 healthy controls were included in our study. A(TA)TAA promoter polymorphism of UGT1A1 gene was studied using the Fragment Analysis Software of an automated DNA sequencer and three genotypes (homozygous 7/7, heterozygous 6/7 and normal homozygous 6/6) were identified. Results: No significant differences were observed between the cancer group and controls regarding the genotyping distribution of the three UGT1A1 promoter genotypes (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Also, no association was found between overall disease risk and the presence of the polymorphic homozygous genotype (TA(7)/TA(7) vs TA(6)/TA(7)\u00a0+\u00a0TA(6)/TA(6)) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.18).

This study investigated the effect of GTP on bladder tumor size and angiogenesis in mice given N-butyl-(-4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN), with and without GTP. Methods: Eight-week-old female C3H/He mice were treated with and without 0.05% BBN solution for 14 or 24 weeks. In addition, they were also treated with and without 0.5% GTP solution for the same periods. Histopathological diagnosis was established using hematoxylin and eosin staining, and microvessel density (MVD) was estimated by counting CD34- and von Willebrand factor-positive vessels in the tumor area. Results: At 14 weeks, cancer cells were detected in BBN and BBN\u00a0+\u00a0GTP mice [5/14 (35.7%) and 3/14 (21.4%), respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.678].

However, the frequency of invasive tumors in BBN\u00a0+\u00a0GTP mice was significantly lower (23.8%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.030) than in those given BBN alone (65.2%). Tumor volume and MVD of intratumoral and stromal region in the BBN\u00a0+\u00a0GTP group were also significantly lower than in BBN mice. Conclusion: The results showed that GTP had no anti-carcinogenic effect, but inhibited tumor growth and invasion in mice with established bladder cancer, at least in part through the regulation of angiogenesis. Our data suggest that GTP seems to suppress tumor development in bladder cancer.",

Materials and methods: Incidence cases of larynx cancer (CL) in 1994\u20132004 were provided by the Girona Cancer Registry. A census tract (CT) was assigned to all patients. Socioeconomic data were extracted from the 2001 Census. A deprivation index for each CT was obtained by principal component analysis, using four socioeconomic indicators. The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated using the CL incidence rates in the men of the province of Girona assuming a Poisson distribution. Relative risk was obtained applying the Besag, York and Molli\u00e9 model. The deprivation index was introduced into the model and was categorised in quartiles. Results: Four hundred and seventy-six incident cases in men were registered. CTs in the lowest deprivation index had a lower risk of larynx cancer, with a risk increase in the higher quartiles. In the highest quartile it was 1.91 times greater than in the lowest. This association was significant when the whole province was considered. Discussion: The deprivation index explains only part of the geographical variability of CL incidence. Other risk factors without spatial structure may contribute to this explaination.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate geographic variation in early diagnosis and management of breast cancer. Methods: We used data from a representative sample of 4820 women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2005 identified by seven Swiss population based cancer registries. We collected retrospectively detailed information on mode of detection, tumor characteristics and treatments. Differences across geographic regions were tested for statistical significance using chi-square tests and uni- and multivariate logistic regression. Results: Considerable disparities in early detection and management of early breast cancer were found across regions. In particular, the proportion of early detected cancer varied from 43% in Valais to 27% in St. Gallen-Appenzell. Mastectomy rates varied from 24% in Geneva to 38% in St. Gallen-Appenzell and Grisons-Glarus. Higher reconstruction rates were observed in regions with lower rates of mastectomy. The use of sentinel node procedure in patients with nodal negative disease was high in Geneva and low in Eastern Switzerland. Differences in compliance with recommendations on the use of endocrine therapy and chemotherapy were less pronounced but statistically significant. Conclusions: This analysis shows considerable geographic variation in breast cancer care in a health system characterized by high expenditures, universal access to services and high decentralization. Further study into the causes and effects of this variation on short- and long term patient outcomes is needed.",

Methods: Following the British national survey on attitudes toward cancer registration, we conducted an investigation to correctly evaluate the general opinion of the Japanese population in this regard. We randomly recruited 3000 men and women aged 20\u201369 years from a research database. Results: Only 4% of all respondents had heard about the cancer registry system before the investigation. However, 77% of respondents thought that cancer registration was useful. Forty-three percent of respondents answered, regardless of the strictness of the data protection, that privacy had been violated if the registration occurred without an individual explanation. Compared with the British survey results, Japanese people seemed to be more suspicious about the largely unknown system of cancer registry. Nonetheless, it is noteworthy that Japanese respondents did not show active opposition to cancer registration; they tended to choose \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d instead of \u201cno\u201d to questions asking if they supported the registry system. Multivariate analysis showed that male sex, older age, and living in the southern region were the factors significantly associated with support for cancer registration.

Studies exploring the relationship between the two conditions have been inconclusive. Using a population-based, case\u2013control study of PCa, we explore the relationship between early-onset MPB and PCa risk. Methods: Cases were men aged 35\u201374 diagnosed with PCa between 2002 and 2005 in King County, Washington. Controls were frequency matched by age and identified by random digit dialing. Hair pattern at age 30 and at 1 year prior to diagnosis (cases) or reference date (controls) was determined using showcards. PCa risk associated with balding was assessed with logistic regression. Results: Data from 999 cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. Hair loss at age 30 was more common in controls (25.2%) than cases (19.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and those with hair loss at age 30 had a 29% relative risk reduction for PCa (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.56\u20130.91). No risk reduction was seen for men only reporting hair loss at referent age (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.73\u20131.12). In men aged >60 at referent date, the risk reduction was greater for men with hair loss at age 30 from both the top of head and forehead (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33\u20130.93). Conclusion: Early-onset MPB was associated with a reduced relative risk of PCa in this population-based study.

Interactions between MC1R genotypes and skin colour influenced DLBCL risk; the RR genotype increased risk in individuals with medium or dark skin, based on 5 cases and no controls, but decreased risk among those of fair skin. On the whole, DLBCL and FL risk were not related to genetic variation in MC1R, pigmentation or time spent outdoors.",

The study aim was to assess the relationship of passive and active smoking to breast cancer risk by N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) phenotype, using a comprehensive assessment of both passive and active smoking. Methods: We undertook a population-based case\u2013control study in Northeastern Ontario, Canada of 347 women diagnosed (2002\u20132004) with breast cancer and 775 population-based controls. The mailed study package included a questionnaire requesting information about established breast cancer risk factors, passive and active smoking, and a buccal swab for genetic analyses. Results: Among never-active smokers, a long duration of passive smoking was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio (OR) 1.86 (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.01\u20133.44) (test for trend (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07)); that risk was more elevated for NAT2 slow acetylators (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.16\u20136.59) (and highest in extremely slow acetylators), but not elevated for NAT2 fast acetylators (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.42\u20133.23). Among active smokers more than 20 pack-years of smoking was associated with an OR of 1.34 (95% CI 0.92-1.96); more elevated among NAT2 fast acetylators OR 1.93 (95% CI 1.01\u20133.69) but not elevated among NAT2 slow acetylators. Women who were NAT2 fast acetylators in the highest quartile for duration of active smoking had an OR of 2.74 (95% CI 1.42\u20135.27), with a significant test of trend (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Conclusions: These findings suggest that passive and active smoking may be related to breast cancer, and the effect may be differentially modified by NAT2 phenotype. Further research into the genetic modification of a breast cancer\u2013smoking relationship may help to reconcile earlier discrepant findings.",

Objective: To determine the prevalence and genotype distribution of HPV in young married women aged 16\u201324 years. Methods: 1300 women residing in an urban slum in Delhi donated samples of exfoliated cervical cells that were collected by the Digene\u00ae kit and tested for the presence of HPV DNA by two techniques in parallel, i.e., PCR using PGMY consensus primers for all HPV types and the Digene HPV test (Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) Probe B for high-risk (hr) types. Genotyping was done on all HPV positive samples using the Roche reverse line blot assay. Results: HPV infection was detected in 91/1300 (7%) samples by PCR and 110/1300 (8.4%) samples by HC2. Genotyping identified 20 high-risk and 11 low-risk types. HPV16 was the commonest high-risk type (3%) followed by HPV52 (1.2%) and HPV51 (0.8%). Among low-risk types, HPV62 was the commonest (0.8%), followed by HPV84 and HPV89 (0.5% each). Multiple infections were found in 3% of the HPV positive samples. Conclusion: A wide spectrum of HPV genotypes is seen in this young population.

Two large, population-based state surveys provide the opportunity to investigate repeat and recent mammography prevalence and correlates among California's diverse population. Methods: Data were from women aged 55\u201379, using the 2001 and 2005 California Health Interview Surveys. The study assessed the prevalence and correlates of recent mammography (within the past two years) and repeat mammography (mammogram within the past two years and 3\u201311 mammograms within the past six years). Results: Prevalence was 82.4% (recent) and 73.8% (repeat) in 2001, and 87.1% (recent) and 77.5% (repeat) in 2005. Correlates of lower rates were insurance status, no usual source of care, being a smoker, age 65\u201379, being Asian with no English proficiency, being never married, and lower absolute risk for breast cancer. Especially low ratios of repeat-to-recent mammography existed for the uninsured, and those using the emergency room or with no source of care. Unexpected findings in which unadjusted results were inconsistent with multivariable adjusted results occurred for Latinas with no English proficiency and women at 200\u2013299% of poverty level. Conclusions: Several groups of women in California remain at-risk of lower mammography utilization. However, investigators should also be alert for instances where multivariable analyses seem particularly discrepant with crude rates.",

Two functional variants in the CYP2C9 gene (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) are known to be associated with decreased enzyme activity towards tolbutamide and warfarin, while this has not been investigated for PAHs. We hypothesised that these two variants in the CYP2C9 gene influence risk of tobacco-related cancer. Methods: In a prospective study of the general population (n\u00a0=\u00a010 392) with 60 years of follow-up, the Copenhagen City Heart Study, we associated two variants of CYP2C9 (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) with risk of tobacco-related cancer and all cancer. All results were re-tested in a cross-sectional study of the general population (n\u00a0=\u00a036 856), the Copenhagen General Population Study.

Methods: Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) on 159 patients and 132 controls. Results: The G13964C intronic variant was significantly associated with familial breast cancer risk (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0018) while the genotypic distribution was similar for p53 Arg72Pro and Ins16bp in patients and controls.

     "abstract": "Purpose: Although the risk of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy depends on cumulative oxaliplatin dose, susceptibility to this adverse event differs greatly among patients. In this study, we investigated the associations between oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy and the following polymorphisms: glutathione S-transferase \u03c0 (GSTP1) Ile105Val, and glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGXT) Pro11Leu and AGXT Ile340Met. Experimental design: Eighty-two Japanese patients with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer who received at least six cycles of the modified FOLFOX6 (m-FOLFOX6) regimen were enrolled. To minimize differences in cumulative oxaliplatin dose between patients, oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy was evaluated using an oxaliplatin-specific scale during the 2-week period after completion of the sixth cycle of treatment. Results: Forty-four patients developed grade 2/3 oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy. There were more patients carrying at least one GSTP1105Val allele among the group with grade 2/3 neuropathy (18/44, 41%) than among the group with grade 1 neuropathy (9/38, 24%), although the difference was not statistically significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.098). There were similar numbers of patients carrying at least one AGXT105Met allele in the grade 2/3 neuropathy (7/44, 16%) and grade 1 neuropathy groups (5/38, 13%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.725). The AGXT11Leu allele was not found in any of our patients or controls. Conclusions: We found no significant association between oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy and the GSTP1 Ile105Val and AGXT Ile340Met polymorphisms. Given that no AGXT11Leu allele was found among our study population (n\u00a0=\u00a0177), evaluating this polymorphism in Japanese patients in future studies is likely to be uninformative.",

Twelve tongue cancer patients and twelve healthy subjects participated in this study. A disposable probe with four silver electrodes was used to measure the electrical properties of patient's and healthy subject's tongue tissues at six different frequencies, which were 20\u00a0Hz, 50\u00a0kHz, 1.3\u00a0MHz, 2.5\u00a0MHz, 3.7\u00a0MHz and 5\u00a0MHz. The amplitude of the applied voltage was limited to 200\u00a0mV. Four measurement parameters of impedance, phase angle, real part of impedance, and imaginary part of impedance of tongue were assessed to see if significant difference in values obtained in patient's and healthy subject's tongue tissues existed. Intraclass correlation coefficient showed that all measurements had good reliability and validity (ICC\u00a0>\u00a00.95 for all measurements). Significant differences were found at 20\u00a0Hz (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05\u20130.001 for the four measurement parameters) and 50\u00a0kHz (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for the four measurement parameters) between patient's and healthy subject's tongue tissues.

     "abstract": "Background: The value of testicular cancer (TC) education, and in particular advice on testicular self-examination (TSE), has been widely debated by health professionals. One concern centres on its potential to cause unnecessary anxiety among the target population. Views outside the health professional community about TC education's potential benefits and harms have not previously been described. The objective of this study was to investigate the range of views expressed by specific groups thought to have an interest in provision of TC education. Methods: One-to-one, in-depth interviews with 37 men and women were completed. Participants included TC patients, men with no prior diagnosis of TC, and parents and teachers of adolescent boys. Verbatim transcripts were analysed using the Framework approach to produce a thematic description of views expressed. Results: Participants were unanimously in favour of TC education. Key perceived benefits included earlier cancer detection through increasing knowledge of symptoms leading to better treatment outcomes, and motivating help-seeking by reducing emotional barriers such as fear of cancer or embarrassment. Anxiety was acknowledged as a possible harm but was not expected to be widespread or serious. Conclusion: TC education is viewed favourably by members of the public likely to be interested in its provision. Education's potential to cause anxiety was not considered a disincentive to promoting disease awareness.",

The best available data came from six studies where exposure was estimated from historical measurements and on the whole, no trends in risks of NHL with rising cumulative, average, peak, or duration of benzene exposure were found.

The aim of this study was to provide a novel approach to estimate the testicular cancer incidence in Germany by using nationwide hospitalization data. Methods: We used the nationwide hospitalization data (DRG statistics) of the years 2005\u20132006 including 16,6 million hospitalizations among men. We identified incident testicular cancer cases by the combination of a diagnosis of testicular cancer and an orchiectomy during the same hospitalization and estimated the age-specific and age-standardized (World Standard Population) incidence of testicular cancer across Federal States. We also analyzed available cancer registry data from 2005 to 2006. Results: A total of 8544 hospitalizations indicated incident testicular cancer cases in 2005\u20132006. The nationwide crude incidence rate of testicular cancer was 10,6 per 100.000 person-years. The ratio of the number of registered cases (cancer registry) to the estimated number of cases based on the hospitalization statistics ranged between 79% and 100%. There was only little variation of the age-standardized DRG-based incidence estimates across Federal States (range: 8,2\u201310,6 per 100.000 person-years). Discussion: We provided testicular cancer incidence estimates for each of the 16 Federal States of Germany based on hospitalization data for the first time. The low within-population incidence variability in Germany and high between-population incidence variability in Europe may indicate that ecologic factors play a causal role in the European variation of testicular cancer.",

Crude mortality per 100,000 women, age-standardized mortality using World Standard population and age-stratified mortality were calculated and comparison was made between age groups above and below 50 years. Results: A general pattern of increase was observed in both crude and age-standardized mortality. The overall average crude mortality was 15.6 per 100,000 women (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.9\u201317.1) and the average age-standardized mortality was 18.0 per 100,000 women (95% CI 16.7\u201319.2). There was a pattern of increase in mortality with increasing age. The mortality rate was considerably higher for the age groups above 50 years than those less than 50 years of age both showing an upward trend over the 35-year period. Conclusions: Breast cancer mortality continued to increase over the 35-year period in Trinidad and Tobago. This study did not identify the exact reasons for this increasing trend. However, it is known that Trinidad and Tobago is becoming much more industrialized. It may be speculated that decrease in fertility rates, increase in the incidence of obesity and hormone utilization could have influenced this trend.",

The age-standardized yearly incidence rates regarding the total number of de novo AL was 5.3/100\u00a0000 inhabitant for Estonia and 8.0 for Sweden, this difference being statistically significant merely as regards acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The relative survival for the total cohort of de novo AL as well as for de novo AML was significantly longer (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for Swedish as compared to Estonian patients. Methods: In view of the miserable outcome for the Estonian patients we decided to prospectively compare the results for incidence and outcome of de novo AL between the two countries. Results: The present report covers the first 5-year period comprising 1997\u20132001 and deals only with patients aged \u226565 years at diagnosis. The age-adjusted annual incidence rates for de novo AML were lower in Estonia (6.4/100\u00a0000) than in Sweden (9.2/100\u00a0000) but not significantly so. The present results also show that the outcome for the Estonian AML patients had improved considerably over the study period; thus, at no time point, i.e., at 1, 3 and 5 years did relative survival between the two countries differ significantly. Conclusion: Yet, as compared to the Swedish cohort relative survival for the Estonian patients did still not reach an acceptable level.",

We aimed to identify spatial variation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at a high-risk area in China and determine its association with socioeconomic status (SES). Methods: Based on 2299 liver cancer cases diagnosed in Haimen from 2003 to 2006, we calculated age\u2013sex standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and used two spatial scan statistics to determine the geographic variations in HCC. Bayesian hierarchical model was used to explore the association between HCC incidence and SES. Results: Age and sex SIRs for HCC varied from 0.54 to 1.97 for 24 townships. The eastern region of Haimen was identified to have a significantly increased risk of HCC. Fitting of a Bayesian hierarchical model linking per-capita fiscal revenue with SIRs of HCC indicated that the area with a lower revenue had a significantly higher incidence of HCC [\u03b2log(revenue)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.179, posterior 95% Bayesian credible interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a0(\u22120.326, \u22120.04)]. Conclusions: This study demonstrated substantial geographic variation in the incidence of HCC within a high-risk region, which was associated with SES.

     "abstract": "Aim: Women with a history of benign breast disease are at increased risk of subsequent breast cancer. However, few studies have examined whether established breast cancer risk factors other than histology are associated with an altered risk of breast cancer in women with benign breast disease. We used a nested case-control design within a large, multi-center cohort of women biopsied for benign breast disease (BBD) to estimate odds ratios for breast cancer in association with exposure to a range of personal and lifestyle factors. Methods: Cases were women biopsied for BBD who subsequently developed breast cancer; controls were individually matched to cases on center and age at diagnosis and were women biopsied for BBD who did not develop breast cancer in the same follow-up interval as that for the cases. After excluding women with prevalent breast cancer, 1357 records (661 case records and 696 records) were available for analysis. We used conditional logistic regression to obtain crude and multivariable-adjusted estimates of the association between specific factors and risk of breast cancer. Results: In multivariable analyses age at first live birth, number of pregnancies, and postmenopausal status were inversely associated with risk of breast cancer. The odds ratio for women with age at first birth <25 years and \u22653 pregnancies, relative to nulliparous women, was 0.49, 95% confidence interval 0.13\u20130.79, and that for postmenopausal women relative to premenopausal women was 0.60, 95% CI 0.37\u20130.99. Conclusions: Further study of personal factors influencing the risk of breast cancer in women with BBD may help to identify subgroups of the population at increased risk of invasive disease.",

     "abstract": "Background: Micronutrients may protect against colorectal cancer. Especially folate has been considered potentially preventive. However, studies on folate and colorectal cancer have found contradicting results; dietary folate seems preventive, whereas folic acid in supplements and fortification may increase the risk. Objective: To evaluate the association between intake of vitamins C, E, folate and beta-carotene and colorectal cancer risk, focusing on possibly different effects of dietary, supplemental and total intake, and on potential effect modification by lifestyle factors. Design: In a prospective cohort study of 56,332 participants aged 50\u201364 years, information on diet, supplements and lifestyle was collected through questionnaires. 465 Colon and 283 rectal cancer cases were identified during follow-up. Incidence rate ratios of colon and rectal cancers related to micronutrient intake were calculated using Cox proportional hazard analyses. Results: The present study found a protective effect of dietary but not supplemental folate on colon cancer. No association with any other micronutrient was found. Rectal cancer did not seem associated with any micronutrient. For both colon and rectal cancer, we found an interaction between dietary folate and alcohol intake, with a significant, preventive effect among those consuming above 10\u00a0g alcohol/day only. Conclusions: This study adds further weight to the evidence that dietary folate protects against colon cancer, and specifies that there is a source-specific effect, with no preventive effect of supplemental folic acid. Further studies should thus take source into account. Vitamins C, E and beta-carotene showed no relation with colorectal cancer.",

     "abstract": "Objective: An excess of cancer cases was reported in 2000 among Italian troops involved in peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. A preliminary assessment of cancer risk in this cohort was done for the period 1996\u20132007, based on cancer surveillance activity, which was started in 2001. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was done among 27\u00a0361 Italian Army soldiers deployed in Bosnia, 31\u00a0052 deployed in Kosovo, and a control group of non-deployed soldiers, whose number varies from 130\u00a0275 in 1996 to 40\u00a0967 in 2007. Standardized incidence ratio and 95% confidence intervals (SIR [95% CI]) of the main types of tumours were computed as the ratio of the observed and expected cases. Results: 98 incident cancers were reported among soldiers deployed in Bosnia, 66 in those stationed in Kosovo and 388 in non-deployed personnel. Overall, cancer incidence was lower than expected in all groups. Annual SIR was significantly higher than expected in 2000 for Hodgkin's lymphoma only among troops deployed in Bosnia (4.34 [1.18\u201311.12]) and non-deployed personnel (3.48 [1.67\u20136.39]); and in 2001 for thyroid cancer only among troops deployed in Bosnia (5.28 [1.44\u201313.51]). Conclusion: Although further investigation is needed, these preliminary results give no indication of an increased risk of cancer for Italian soldiers who were stationed in Bosnia and Kosovo. The cluster of Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2000 and of thyroid cancer in 2001 were sporadic events, they did not specifically affect deployed personnel and are unlikely to be related to environmental exposures in the Balkans.",

We investigated the association between six occupational categories defined a priori: chemical, metal, agricultural, construction, electrical/electronic and transport, and the risk of glioma, meningioma and acoustic neuroma. Methods: In a population-based case\u2013control study involving a total of 844 cases and 1688 controls conducted from 2000 to 2003, detailed information on life-long job histories was collected during personal interviews and used to create job calendars for each participant. Job title, job activity, job number, and the starting and ending dates of the activity were recorded for all activities with duration of at least 1 year. Reported occupational activities were coded according to the International Standard Classification of Occupations 1988 (ISCO 88). For the analyses we focused on six a priori defined occupational sectors, namely chemical, metal, agricultural, construction, electrical/electronic and transport. Multiple conditional logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. Results: Most of the observed odds ratios were close to 1.0 for ever having worked in the six occupational sectors and risk of glioma, meningioma and acoustic neuroma. Sub-group analyses according to duration of employment resulted in two elevated odds ratios with confidence intervals excluding unity. Conclusions: We did not observe an increased risk of glioma or meningioma for occupations in the agricultural, construction, transport, chemical, electrical/electronic and metal sectors. The number of \u2018significant\u2019 odds ratios is consistent with an overall \u2018null-effect\u2019.",

     "abstract": "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. MCCs and some other skin cancers, such as basal cell carcinomas, frequently harbour Merkel cell polyomavirus DNA. The purpose of the study was to investigate the frequency of second cancers following the diagnosis of MCC. We studied the incidence of second primary cancers after the diagnosis of MCC from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry in 1979\u20132006. Among the 172 MCC patients identified a total of 34 second primary cancers were detected in 30 individuals after the diagnosis of MCC. Female MCC patients were diagnosed with 25 subsequent cancers (SIR, 2.35; 95% CI, 1.52\u20133.47; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and male patients with 9 cancers (SIR, 2.32, 95% CI, 1.06\u20134.40; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The MCC patients had an increased risk for a subsequent cancer (any site) compared to age-, gender- and calendar period-matched general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62\u20133.27). The risks for basal cell carcinoma of the skin (O\u00a0=\u00a011), SIR, 3.48; 95% CI, 1.74\u20136.22 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (O\u00a0=\u00a02), SIR, 17.9; 95% CI, 2.16\u201364.6 were significantly elevated. The SIRs for an overall second primary cancer risk did not change markedly with time since the diagnosis of MCC. We conclude that patients diagnosed with MCC have an increased risk for a second cancer. This risk may in part result from shared etiological factors between MCC and other tumour types, such as immunosuppression or possibly Merkel cell polyomavirus infection.",

In order to clarify the effect of GSTT1 polymorphism on the risk of developing colorectal cancer, we carried out a meta-analysis using published data to obtain more precise estimates of risk. Methods: Electronic searches of PubMed and EMBASE were conducted to select studies for this meta-analysis. Papers were included if they were observational studies investigating the association between GSTT1 polymorphism and colorectal cancer risk. The principal outcome measure was the odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of colorectal cancer associated with GSTT1 null genotype. Results: We identified 30 eligible studies, which included 7635 cases and 12,911 controls. The combined results based on all studies showed that there was a statistically significant link between GSTT1 null genotype and colorectal cancer risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.20, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.03\u20131.40). In the analysis of ethnic groups, we observed distinct differences associated with GSTT1 null genotype, the pooled odds ratios for the GSTT1 polymorphism were 1.32 in Caucasians (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09\u20131.58) and 1.03 in Asians (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.81\u20131.32). As far as concerned the interaction between GSTT1 genotype and colorectal cancer risk in relation to smoking history, there was no increase in risk for smokers or nonsmokers with the GSTT1 null genotype (smokers: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.13, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.80\u20131.60, nonsmokers: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.99, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.71\u20131.38). When stratifying by the location of colorectal cancer, we found that there was a statistically significant link in rectal cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.50, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09\u20132.07), but not in colon cancer (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.94\u20131.88). No associations could be detected between null GSTT1 polymorphism and age, sex, tumor stage and differentiation.

Methods: Data from the Canadian Community Health Survey cycle 2.1 (2003) were utilized. Self-reported screening histories were used as outcome variables: socioeconomic status and medical histories were used as predictive variables. Analyses were weighted to represent the target population. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to compare the screening pattern among Asian immigrant women and corresponding non-immigrant Canadians. Results: In total, 508 Asian immigrant women were included in this study. The results suggest that 71% and 60% of Asian immigrant women reported ever having had and recent mammogram use, respectively, while the corresponding figures for non-immigrant women were 89% and 72%. The observed differences were statistically significant and could not be explained by confounding factors. The ability to speak one of the two official languages is an important barrier to mammography screening among Asian immigrant women.

     "abstract": "Background: Although the digital rectal exam (DRE) is a common method of screening for prostate cancer and other abnormalities, the limits of ability to perform this hands-on exam are unknown. Perceptible limits are a function of the size, depth, and hardness of abnormalities within a given prostate stiffness. Methods: To better understand the perceptible limits of the DRE, we conducted a psychophysical study with 18 participants using a custom-built apparatus to simulate prostate tissue and abnormalities of varying size, depth, and hardness. Utilizing a modified version of the psychophysical method of constant stimuli, we uncovered thresholds of absolute detection and variance in ability between examiners. Results: Within silicone-elastomers that mimic normal prostate tissue (21\u00a0kPa), abnormalities of 4\u00a0mm diameter (20\u00a0mm3 volume) and greater were consistently detectable (above 75% of the time) but only at a depth of 5\u00a0mm. Abnormalities located in simulated tissue of greater stiffness (82\u00a0kPa) had to be twice that volume (5\u00a0mm diameter, 40\u00a0mm3 volume) to be detectable at the same rate. Conclusions: This study finds that the size and depth of abnormalities most influence detectability, while the relative stiffness between abnormalities and substrate also affects detectability for some size/depth combinations. While limits identified here are obtained for idealized substrates, this work is useful for informing the development of training and allowing clinicians to set expectations on performance.",

     "abstract": "The possible role for DNA repair deficiencies in cancer development, namely in breast cancer has been the subject of increasing interest since it has been reported that breast cancer patients might be deficient in the repair of DNA damage. Exposure to ionizing radiation has been pointed out as a risk factor for breast cancer, and the type of DNA lesions induced by this carcinogen can be repaired by homologous recombination DNA repair (HRR) pathway. To evaluate the potential modifying role of some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in HRR involved genes on the individual susceptibility to breast cancer we carried out a hospital based case\u2013control study in a Caucasian Portuguese population (289 histological confirmed breast cancer patients and 548 control individuals). We genotyped 4 SNPs in 4 different HRR pathway genes, XRCC2 (Ex3\u00a0+\u00a0442G\u00a0>\u00a0A, R188H, rs3218536), XRCC3 (Ex8-5C\u00a0>\u00a0T, T241M, rs861539), NBS1 (Ex5-32C\u00a0>\u00a0G, E185Q, rs1805794) and RAD51 5\u2032UTR (Ex1-59G\u00a0>\u00a0T, rs1801321), tagging 41 SNPs in these genes. The frequency of the different polymorphisms in the Portuguese control population is similar to the ones reported for other Caucasian populations, and the deviation of the Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium was only observed for the XRCC2 (Ex3\u00a0+\u00a0442G\u00a0>\u00a0A, R188H, rs3218536) polymorphism in the control population. The results obtained, after logistic regression analysis, did not reveal a major role of these polymorphisms on breast cancer susceptibility. However, when the population was stratified according to breast feeding (women that breast fed and women that never breast fed) it is observed, in women that never breast fed, that the heterozygous individuals for the XRCC2 (Ex3\u00a0+\u00a0442G\u00a0>\u00a0A, R188H, rs3218536) polymorphism have a decreased risk for breast cancer [adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.45; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.22\u20130.92] (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Additionally, after stratification according to menopausal status, our results suggest that post-menopausal women carrying at least one variant allele for the XRCC3 (Ex8-5C\u00a0>\u00a0T, T241M, rs861539) polymorphism have a lower risk for breast cancer [adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.67; 95% CI, 0.47\u20130.94] (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Most of the studies suggest that breastfeeding may be responsible for 2/3 of the estimate reduction of breast cancer. The longer the duration of breastfeeding the lower the potential risk associated with breast cancer. Therefore, in our study the potential protective role of the variant allele of XRCC2 (Ex3\u00a0+\u00a0442G\u00a0>\u00a0A, R188H, rs3218536), in never breast fed women, might be related with a more efficient DNA repair activity.",

Male to female ratio was 4.43:1 (previously 4.48:1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.952) while the smoker to non-smoker ratio was 2.67:1 (previously 2.68:1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.980). The commonest histological types were squamous cell (34.8%), adenocarcinoma (26.0%) and small cell (18.4%) while previously these were 34.3%, 25.9% and 20.3%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.916. However, in the present study, significant differences were observed between smokers and non-smokers in relation to distribution of gender, histology and disease stage. Conclusions: There has been no significant change in the epidemiology of LC in North India over the past three decades. An absence of change in the smoking pattern of the population could be a possible reason.",

     "abstract": "Cancer statistics from India revealed that childhood cancer incidence is lesser in rural than urban India. This might be due to under-diagnosis or under-ascertainment of cases or could even be true. With registries able to explicitly measure and appropriately streamline the ascertainment of cases to comply with acceptable standards, it is under-diagnosis that is variable and highly influenced by development of or accessibility to specialized centres in or around the registry area. This is reflected implicitly by marked variation in incidence between different populations in India: weighted age standardized rates of all childhood cancers together was the highest (108 per million) in metropolitan areas, followed by other urban (86) and rural (53) areas in that order. A childhood cancer registry focusing on pertinent data collection and specific epidemiological studies is desirable to explain the variations in incidence and outcome of childhood cancers in India.",
