     "abstract": "Histone methyltransferases (HMTs) catalyze the methylation of lysine and arginine residues on histone tails and non-histone targets. These important post-translational modifications are exquisitely regulated and affect chromatin compaction and transcriptional programs leading to diverse biological outcomes. There is accumulating evidence that genetic alterations of several HMTs impinge on oncogenic or tumor-suppressor functions and influence both cancer initiation and progression. HMTs therefore represent an opportunity for therapeutic targeting in those patients with tumors in which HMTs are dysregulated, to reverse the histone marks and transcriptional programs associated with aggressive tumor behavior. In this review, we describe the known histone methyltransferases and their emerging roles in breast cancer tumorigenesis.",

     "abstract": "Chemoresistance is a major challenge in lung cancer treatment. Recent findings have revealed that autophagic mechanism contributes significantly to immunosuppressive related chemoresistance. For that reason, targeting autophagy-related immunosuppression is an important approach to reverse tumor drug resistance. In this study, we report for the first time that autophagy inhibition triggers upregulation of CD4+, Foxp3+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in late metastatic lung cancer tissues. Furthermore, autophagy blockage induces chemosensitization to carboplatin, immune activation and cell cycle arrest. This induction correlated with reduction in expression of drug resistance genes MDR1, MRP1, ABCG2 and ABCC2 along with decreased expression of PD-L1 which is associated with severe dysfunction of tumor specific CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, experiments revealed that co-treatment of carboplatin and autophagy inhibitor chloroquine increased lung tissue infiltration by CD4+, FoxP3+ lymphocytes and antigen-specific immune activation. Subsequent ex\u00a0vivo experiments showed the activation of carboplatin related TRAIL-dependent apoptosis through caspase 8 and a synergistic role of miR-155 in lung tissue infiltration by CD4+, and FoxP3+ lymphocytes. Overall, our results indicate that autophagy blockage increases lung cancer chemosensitivity to carboplatin, but also reveal that miR-155 functions as a novel immune system activator by promoting TILs infiltration. These results indicate that targeting of autophagy can prevent cancer related immunosuppression and elucidate immune cell infiltration in tumor microenvironment thus representing a potential therapeutic strategy to inhibit lung cancer progression and metastasis.",

     "abstract": "Deregulation of microRNAs contributes to the aberrant growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we showed that miR-634 expression was frequently decreased in HCC. Low miR-634 expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, poorer tumor differentiation, advanced TNM stage, vascular invasion, absence of tumor capsule and unfavorable overall survival. Overexpression of miR-634 markedly attenuated cell viability, colony formation, tumor growth and metastasis, whereas miR-634 inhibition resulted in the opposite phenotypes. Furthermore, re-introduction of miR-634 induced cell apoptosis in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Mechanistically, miR-634 inhibited the expression of Rab1A and DHX33 via directly binding to the 3\u2032-UTR of both genes. In clinical samples, the expression of Rab1A or DHX33 was reversely correlated with miR-634. Re-expression of Rab1A or DHX33 abrogated the miR-634-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation and migration. Collectively, our data suggest a tumor suppressor role of miR-634 in HCC. The newly identified miR-634/Rab1A or miR-634/DHX33 axis serves as a potential therapeutic target for the clinical management.",

Classical clinicopathologic parameters have limited prognostic value. The aim of this study was to identify a gene expression signature measured in CRLM discriminating early from late recurrence after partial hepatectomy.CRLM from two patient groups were collected: I) with recurrent disease \u226412 months after surgery (N\u00a0=\u00a033), and II) without recurrences and disease free for \u226536 months (N\u00a0=\u00a030). The patients were clinically homogeneous; all had a low clinical risk score (0\u20132) and did not receive (neo-) adjuvant chemotherapy. Total RNA was hybridised to Illumina arrays, and processed for analysis. A leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) analysis was performed to identify a prognostic gene expression signature.LOOCV yielded an 11-gene profile with prognostic value in relation to recurrent disease \u226412 months after partial hepatectomy. This signature had a sensitivity of 81.8%, with a specificity of 66.7% for predicting recurrences (\u226412 months) versus no recurrences for at least 36 months after surgery (X2 P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).The current study yielded an 11-gene signature at mRNA level in CRLM discriminating early from late or no relapse after partial hepatectomy.",

However, patient prognosis and disease progression relevant to immune checkpoints in gastric tumor microenvironment are not defined. This study aims to investigate the expression and prognostic significance of immune checkpoints within gastric cancer. In the study, a cohort of 398 cancer tissues from stage I to IV gastric cancer patients were assessed for programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) infiltration using immunohistochemistry to ascertain their survival correlation. The data revealed that higher TIL density correlated with less risk of disease progression, and exhibited survival benefits in gastric cancer patients, and PD-L1 positivity showed a significant association with the presence of high TIL infiltration. Furthermore, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect expression of multiple immune checkpoints with the relation to clinical outcome in 139 samples randomly selected from the same cohort, and higher messenger RNA levels of most immune checkpoints were associated with favorable outcome, while consistently showing a positive correlation with interferon gamma levels. In situ hybridization was used to determine the localization of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) in 97 specimens, and showed EBV-positive gastric cancer samples correlated with PD-L1 expression and increased TIL density. These results suggest that induction of immune checkpoint within gastric cancer patients reflects a high immune infiltration density, especially in those with EBV-associated gastric cancer, which may direct patient selection for checkpoint blockade therapy.",

     "abstract": "Valosin-containing protein (VCP) or p97, a member of AAA-ATPase protein family, has been associated with various cellular functions including endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), Golgi membrane reassembly, autophagy, DNA repair, and cell division. Recent studies identified VCP and ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) as synthetic lethal targets in ovarian cancer. Here, we describe the preclinical activity of VCP inhibitors in ovarian cancer. Results from our studies suggest that quinazoline-based VCP inhibitors initiate G1 cell cycle arrest, attenuate cap-dependent translation and induce programmed cell death via the intrinsic and the extrinsic modes of apoptosis. Mechanistic studies point to the unresolved unfolded protein response (UPR) as a mechanism by which VCP inhibitors contribute to cytotoxicity. These results support an emerging concept that UPR and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathways may be targeted in ovarian cancer as a source of vulnerability. Since prolonged ER stress may result in CHOP-mediated cell death, we tested the hypothesis that VCP inhibitors act synergistically with compounds that enhance CHOP expression. Here, we show that VCP inhibitors act synergistically with Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2\u03b1 dephosphorylation, by enhancing CHOP expression in ovarian cancer cell lines. Our results provide a proof-of-concept that VCP inhibitors can be used as a single agent and can be synergized with compounds that enhance CHOP expression to induce cell death in ovarian cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "Assessing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising method to evaluate somatic mutations from solid tumors in a minimally-invasive way. In a group of twelve metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients undergoing liver metastasectomy, from each patient DNA from cell-free DNA (cfDNA), the primary tumor, metastatic liver tissue, normal tumor-adjacent colon or liver tissue, and whole blood were obtained. Investigated was the feasibility of a targeted NGS approach to identify somatic mutations in ctDNA. This targeted NGS approach was also compared with NGS preceded by mutant allele enrichment using synchronous coefficient of drag alteration technology embodied in the OnTarget assay, and for selected mutations with digital PCR (dPCR). All tissue and cfDNA samples underwent IonPGM sequencing for a CRC-specific 21-gene panel, which was analyzed using a standard and a modified calling pipeline. In addition, cfDNA, whole blood and normal tissue DNA were analyzed with the OnTarget assay and with dPCR for specific mutations in cfDNA as detected in the corresponding primary and/or metastatic tumor tissue. NGS with modified calling was superior to standard calling and detected ctDNA in the cfDNA of 10 patients harboring mutations in APC, ATM, CREBBP, FBXW7, KRAS, KMT2D, PIK3CA and TP53. Using this approach, variant allele frequencies in plasma ranged predominantly from 1 to 10%, resulting in limited concordance between ctDNA and the primary tumor (39%) and the metastases (55%). Concordance between ctDNA and tissue markedly improved when ctDNA was evaluated for KRAS, PIK3CA and TP53 mutations by the OnTarget assay (80%) and digital PCR (93%). Additionally, using these techniques mutations were observed in tumor-adjacent tissue with normal morphology in the majority of patients, which were not observed in whole blood. In conclusion, in these mCRC patients with oligometastatic disease NGS on cfDNA was feasible, but had limited sensitivity to detect all somatic mutations present in tissue. Digital PCR and mutant allele enrichment before NGS appeared to be more sensitive to detect somatic mutations.",

Four specimen-matched cellular compartments (normal-appearing epithelium and its adjacent stroma, and malignant epithelium and its adjacent stroma) were isolated for each case. The signaling network analysis of the four compartments unraveled a number of molecular mechanisms underlying the communication between tumor cells and stroma in the context of the tumor microenvironment.

Exosomes are nano-sized vesicles with membrane-bound proteins that reflect their originating cell. Prognostic biomarkers are needed to improve patient selection for optimal treatment. We here evaluate exosomes by protein phenotyping as a prognostic biomarker in NSCLC.Exosomes from plasma of 276 NSCLC patients were phenotyped using the Extracellular Vesicle Array; 49 antibodies captured the proteins on the exosomes, and a cocktail of biotin-conjugated antibodies binding the general exosome markers CD9, CD81 and CD63 was used to visualise the captured exosomes. For each individual membrane-bound protein, results were analysed based on presence, in a concentration-dependent manner, and correlated to overall survival (OS).The 49 proteins attached to the exosomal membrane were evaluated. NY-ESO-1, EGFR, PLAP, EpCam and Alix had a significant concentration-dependent impact on inferior OS. Due to multiple testing, NY-ESO-1 was the only marker that maintained a significant impact on inferior survival (hazard rate (HR) 1.78 95% (1.78\u20132.44); p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) after Bonferroni correction.

     "publication date": "12-2016",
     "abstract": "The role of bone morphogenic protein 9 (BMP9) signaling in angiogenesis has been controversial, with a number of studies showing that it acts either as a pro-angiogenic or, conversely, as an anti-angiogenic factor in a context-dependent manner. Notably, BMP9 was also reported to function in both pro- or anti-tumorigenic roles during tumor progression. It has therefore remained unclear, whether selective BMP9 inhibition is a useful target for antibody therapy of cancer. To shed light on these questions, we characterized BMP9 expression in plasma of patients with different cancer indications and found elevated levels of pro-domains and precursor BMP9 with a strong response in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). These studies prompted us to evaluate the potential of selective anti-BMP9 cancer therapy in RCC. We generated a novel monoclonal therapeutic antibody candidate, mAb BMP9-0093, that selectively targets all different BMP9 variants but does not bind to the closest homolog BMP10. In\u00a0vitro, mAb BMP9-0093 treatment inhibited signaling, endothelin-1 (ET-1) production and spreading of endothelial cells and restored BMP9-induced decrease in pericyte migration and attachment. Furthermore, BMP9-mediated epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition of renal cell carcinoma cells was reversed by mAb BMP9-0093 treatment in\u00a0vitro. In\u00a0vivo, mAb BMP9-0093 showed significant anti-tumor activity that was associated with an increase in apoptosis as well as a decrease in tumor cell proliferation and ET-1 release. Furthermore, mAb BMP9-0093 induced mural cell coverage of endothelial cells, which was corroborated by a reduction in vascular permeability, demonstrated by a diminished penetration of omalizumab-Alexa 647 into tumor tissue. Our findings provide new evidence for a better understanding of BMP9 contribution in tumor progression and angiogenesis that may result in the development of effective targeted therapeutic interventions.",

To further develop the test into routine clinical practice, we collected serum of women examined by clinical mammography (N\u00a0=\u00a0197) according to standard operational procedures (SOPs) of the Danish Cancer Biobank. The performance of the circulating 9-miRNA profile was analyzed in 116 of these women, including 36 with breast cancer (aged 50\u201374), following a standardized protocol that mimicked a routine clinical set-up. We confirmed that the profile is significantly different between women with breast cancer and controls (p-value <0.0001), with an AUC of 0.61. Significantly, one woman whose 9-miRNA profile predicted a 73% probability of having breast cancer indeed developed the disease within one year despite being categorized as clinically healthy at the time of blood sample collection and mammography. We propose that this miRNA profile combined with mammography will increase the overall accuracy of early detection of breast cancer.",

Similar to hydroxyurea, it caused a disruption of the cell cycle distribution of cultured HL-60 cells. In contrast to hydroxyurea, the disruption was reversible, indicating higher specificity.

     "abstract": "Oncolytic measles virus strains are currently being evaluated in several clinical trials, as a promising novel oncolytic platform. Poliovirus receptor-related 4 (PVRL4) was recently identified as a potent measles virus (MV) receptor; however, its regulation is not yet understood. Increased levels of PVRL4 protein were observed in cell membrane, cytoplasm and nuclei of glioblastoma, breast and ovarian tumor clinical samples with no significant change in PVRL4 mRNA levels in glioblastoma and breast cancer compared with their corresponding control samples, suggesting that PVRL4 is likely post-transcriptionally regulated. Therefore, we sought to investigate the potential role of miRNAs in PVRL4 regulation and thus MV infectivity. We demonstrated that miR-31 and miR-128 can bind to the 3\u2032UTR of PVRL4 and decrease PVRL4 levels while anti-miR-31/128 increase PVRL4 levels suggesting that PVRL4 is miRNA targeted. Furthermore, miR-31/128 expression levels were down-regulated in glioblastoma and breast tumor samples and showed significant negative correlations with PVRL4 levels. Infection with an MV strain that exclusively utilizes PVRL4 as its receptor showed that over-expression of miR-31/128 decreases MV infectivity while inhibition of the respective miRNAs via anti-miRs increase MV infectivity and reduce tumor size in mouse xenograft models of glioblastoma, breast and ovarian cancer. Additionally, miR-128 levels showed significant correlations with MV infection and in\u00a0vivo anti-tumor effect, while MV infection increased miR-31 expression and thereby contributed to the observed decrease in PVRL4 levels. This study suggests that PVRL4 is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-128 and miR-31 and harbors possible miRNA targets that could modulate MV infectivity and in turn enhance MV based oncolytic therapeutic strategies.",

NIR-PIT has successfully treated preclinical tumor models with APCs and is now in the first-in-human phase 1 clinical trial for head and neck cancer patients against EGFR. CD20 is highly expressed in many B-cell lymphomas and is emerging as a molecular target for this disease. Here, we describe the use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb), rituximab-IR700 APC for NIR-PIT of B-cell lymphoma in two CD20-expressing lymphoma mouse models. CD20 expressing B-cell lymphoma cell lines (Daudi and Ramos) were used in this study. Rituximab-IR700, rituximab conjugated with IRDye700DX, showed specific binding, and cell-specific killing only after exposure of NIR light to both cells in\u00a0vitro. To evaluate effects of NIR-PIT in\u00a0vivo, tumor-bearing mice were separated into 4 groups: (1) control; (2) APC i.v. only; (3) NIR light exposure only; (4) APC and NIR light (NIR-PIT). These were performed every week for up to 3 weeks. Rituximab-IR700 showed high tumor accumulation and high target-to-background ratio in\u00a0vivo.

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is the key enzyme in prostaglandin E2 catabolism and is down-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue. Canonical Wnt signaling is frequently elevated in colon cancers and has been shown to down-regulate 15-PGDH expression. Therefore, we have in the current study investigated if the non-canonical ligand WNT5A relates to increased expression of 15-PGDH in colon cancer cells. In the same cohort of patients, we demonstrated a parallel and significant loss of 15-PGDH and WNT5A protein expression in CRC tissues compared with matched normal colon tissues. Furthermore, patients with low 15-PGDH/WNT5A expression in their tumors showed reduced survival compared with patients with high 15-PGDH/WNT5A expression. To investigate if WNT5A signaling directly affects 15-PGDH expression, we performed in\u00a0vitro analyses of colon cancer cells (HT-29 and Caco-2). Both cell lines, when treated with recombinant WNT5A (rWNT5A) or Foxy-5, a WNT5A-mimicking peptide, responded by increasing their expression of 15-PGDH mRNA and protein. Our investigations showed that rWNT5A and Foxy-5 induced this increased expression of 15-PGDH through reduced \u03b2-catenin signaling as well as increased JNK/AP-1 signaling in colon cancer cells. WNT5A signaling also induced increased 15-PGDH expression in a breast cancer cell line both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. In agreement, WNT5A signaling also increased the expression of the differentiation markers sucrose-isomaltase and mucin-2 in colon cancer cells. Our results show that WNT5A signaling regulates 15-PGDH expression, thus uncovering a novel mechanism by which WNT5A acts as a tumor suppressor and suggests that increased 15-PGDH expression could be used as an indicator of a positive response to Foxy-5 in patients treated with this WNT5A agonist.",

Standard techniques include the determination of IHC in combination with in situ hybridization techniques to confirm a HER2-neu amplification in case of IHC2+ using either a core-needle biopsy or a surgical specimen. qPCR has been also demonstrated to be able to determine HER2 status, mostly in core biopsies or in surgical specimens. Fine-needle aspiration is a reliable, quicker and less invasive technique that is widely used for diagnosis of invasive breast cancer. In this study, we assessed the performance of qPCR in invasive breast carcinomas to determine HER2-neu status by using fine-needle aspiration samples and comparing to standard IHC and FISH. From a total of 154 samples from patients who had nodular breast lesions and attended the 1-day-stop clinic at the Gustave Roussy from March 2013 to October 2014, qPCR was able to determine the HER2 status in a mean of 3.7 days (SD 3.1). The overall concordance with standard HER2-testing was very high: 97% (95% CI 0.94 to 0.99); sensitivity was 96% (0.87\u20131), specificity 98% (0.95\u20131) and positive and negative predictive values 88% (0.75\u20131) and 99% (0.98\u20131), respectively.In conclusion, our study demonstrates that qPCR performed using fine-needle aspiration samples from a primary tumour is a reliable and fast method to determine HER2/neu status in patients with early breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Increasing interest has been devoted in recent years to the understanding of alternative splicing in cancer. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis to identify cancer-associated splice variants in non-small cell lung cancer. We discovered and validated novel differences in the splicing of genes known to be relevant to lung cancer biology, such as NFIB, ENAH or SPAG9. Gene enrichment analyses revealed an important contribution of alternative splicing to cancer-related molecular functions, especially those involved in cytoskeletal dynamics. Interestingly, a substantial fraction of the altered genes found in our analysis were targets of the protein quaking (QKI), pointing to this factor as one of the most relevant regulators of alternative splicing in non-small cell lung cancer. We also found that ESYT2, one of the QKI targets, is involved in cytoskeletal organization. ESYT2-short variant inhibition in lung cancer cells resulted in a cortical distribution of actin whereas inhibition of the long variant caused an increase of endocytosis, suggesting that the cancer-associated splicing pattern of ESYT2 has a profound impact in the biology of cancer cells. Finally, we show that low nuclear QKI expression in\u00a0non-small cell lung cancer is an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.47; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.11\u20135.46, P\u00a0=\u00a00.026).

We performed a proof-of-concept study by whole exome sequencing of multiple tumour regions (n\u00a0=\u00a022) from three patients with metastatic bladder cancer. DNA from primary and metastatic tumour biopsies was analysed for mutations using Mutect and potential therapeutic targets were identified.

Disease driver mutations present in all tumour regions could be identified in all cases, however, over time metastasis specific driver mutations emerged. For each patient we identified 6\u201310 potentially therapeutic targets, however very few targets were present in all regions. Low mutational allele frequencies were observed in most regions suggesting a complex mixture of different cancer cells with no spatial demarcation of subclones. In conclusion, primary bladder tumours and metastatic lesions showed heterogeneity at the molecular level, but within the primary tumour the heterogeneity appeared low. The observed lack of potential therapeutic targets common to all cancer cells in primary tumours and metastases emphasizes the challenges in designing rational targeted therapy solely based on analysis of the primary tumours.",

In particular, it is currently not possible at diagnosis to determine which high-risk neuroblastoma patients will ultimately fail upfront therapy.We analyzed the prognostic potential of most published gene expression signatures for NB and developed a new prognostic signature to predict outcome for patients with MYCN amplification. Network and pathway analyses identified candidate therapeutic targets for this MYCN-amplified patient subset with poor outcome.Most signatures have a high capacity to predict outcome of unselected NB patients. However, the majority of published signatures, as well as most randomly generated signatures, are highly confounded by MYCN amplification, and fail to predict outcome in subpopulations of high-risk patients with MYCN-amplified NB. We identify a MYCN module signature that predicts patient outcome for those with MYCN-amplified tumors, that also predicts potential tractable therapeutic signaling pathways and targets including the DNA repair enzyme Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP1).Many prognostic signatures for NB are confounded by MYCN amplification and fail to predict outcome for the subset of high-risk patients with MYCN amplification.

Moreover, the tubular formation capacity in HUVECs was promoted by stimulation with culture media from BGN-overexpressing GC cells, but the exact underlying mechanism is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the role and molecular mechanism of BGN in VEGF expression in endothelial cells. We found that BGN stimulation of endothelial cells increased the interaction between NF-kB and the HIF-1\u03b1 promoter, leading to enhanced promoter activity and increased HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels, as well as augmented HIF-1 activity that resulted in VEGF expression. All of this was dependent on the interaction of BGN with its receptors, TLR2 and TLR4. Moreover, we found that BGN enhanced endothelial cell migration and proliferation, as well as tube formation, in a TLR signaling pathway-dependent manner. In addition, endothelial cell-derived VEGF in turn was found to act on GC cells and promotes their migration. The combined findings of our current and previous studies suggest that BGN secreted from GC cells into the tumor stroma promotes GC development, as well as its progression, potentially through the chronic activation of tumor angiogenesis.",

In addition to being a CSC marker, ALDH1A3 regulates gene expression via retinoic acid (RA) signaling and plays a key role in the progression and chemotherapy resistance of cancer. Therefore, ALDH1A3 represents a druggable anti-cancer target of interest. Since to date, there are no characterized ALDH1A3 isoform inhibitors, drugs that were previously described as inhibiting the activity of other ALDH isoforms were tested for anti-ALDH1A3 activity. Twelve drugs (3-hydroxy-dl-kynurenine, benomyl, citral, chloral hydrate, cyanamide, daidzin, DEAB, disulfiram, gossypol, kynurenic acid, molinate, and pargyline) were compared for their efficacy in inducing apoptosis and reducing ALDH1A3, ALDH1A1 and ALDH2-associated Aldefluor fluorescence in breast cancer cells. Citral was identified as the best inhibitor of ALDH1A3, reducing the Aldefluor fluorescence in breast cancer cell lines and in a patient-derived tumor xenograft. Nanoparticle encapsulated citral specifically reduced the enhanced tumor growth of MDA-MB-231\u00a0cells overexpressing ALDH1A3. To determine the potential mechanisms of citral-mediated tumor growth inhibition, we performed cell proliferation, clonogenic, and gene expression assays. Citral reduced ALDH1A3-mediated colony formation and expression of ALDH1A3-inducible genes. In conclusion, citral is an effective ALDH1A3 inhibitor and is able to block ALDH1A3-mediated breast tumor growth, potentially via blocking its colony forming and gene expression regulation activity. The promise of ALDH1A3 inhibitors as adjuvant therapies for patients with tumors that have a large population of high-ALDH1A3 CSCs is discussed.",

It is important to understand the molecular characteristics associated with survival differences in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors that may inform patient care.RNA sequencing was performed for 51 patient tumor tissues extracted from patients undergoing surgical resection, and expression was associated with overall survival time from diagnosis. Our analysis uncovered 323 transcripts whose expression correlates with survival time in our pancreatic patient cohort. This genomic signature was validated in an independent RNA-seq dataset of 68 additional patients from the International Cancer Genome Consortium. We demonstrate that this transcriptional profile is largely independent of markers of cellular division and present a 19-transcript predictive model built from a subset of the 323 transcripts that can distinguish patients with differing survival times across both the training and validation patient cohorts. We present evidence that a subset of the survival-associated transcripts is associated with resistance to gemcitabine treatment in\u00a0vitro, and reveal that reduced expression of one of the survival-associated transcripts, Angiopoietin-like 4, impairs growth of a gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line.Gene expression patterns in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tumors can distinguish patients with differing survival outcomes after undergoing surgical resection, and the survival difference could be associated with the intrinsic gemcitabine sensitivity of primary patient tumors.

By interacting with p53 and altering its sequence-specific binding to the response elements, the hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) was reported to re-direct p53 regulation of some genes.Coupling massively parallel deep sequencing with p53 chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate that HBx modulates global p53 site selection and that this was strongly influenced by altered interaction with transcription co-factors/co-regulators as well as post-translational modifications. Specifically, HBx attenuated p53-TBP-RB1 transcription complex recruitment and interaction and this was associated with hyper-phosphorylation of p53 at serine 315 by HBx. Concurrently, HBx enhanced p53 DNA occupancy to other response elements either alone by displacing specific transcription factors such as CEBPB and NFkB1, or in complex with distinct interacting co-factors Sp1, JUN and E2F1. Importantly, re-wiring of p53 transcription regulation by HBx was linked to the deregulation of genes involved in cell proliferation and death, suggesting a role of HBx in errant cell fate determination mediated by altered p53 site selection of target genes.Our study thus presents first evidence of global modes of p53 transcription alteration by HBx and provides new insights to understand and potentially curtail the viral oncoprotein.",

     "abstract": "DNA replication control is a key process in maintaining genomic integrity. Monitoring DNA replication initiation is particularly important as it needs to be coordinated with other cellular events and should occur only once per cell cycle. Crucial players in the initiation of DNA replication are the ORC protein complex, marking the origin of replication, and the Cdt1 and Cdc6 proteins, that license these origins to replicate by recruiting the MCM2-7 helicase. To accurately achieve its functions, Cdt1 is tightly regulated. Cdt1 levels are high from metaphase and during G1 and low in S/G2 phases of the cell cycle. This control is achieved, among other processes, by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In an overexpression screen for Cdt1 deubiquitinating enzymes, we isolated USP37, to date the first ubiquitin hydrolase controlling Cdt1. USP37 overexpression stabilizes Cdt1, most likely a phosphorylated form of the protein. In contrast, USP37 knock down destabilizes Cdt1, predominantly during G1 and G1/S phases of the cell cycle. USP37 interacts with Cdt1 and is able to de-ubiquitinate Cdt1 in\u00a0vivo and, USP37 is able to regulate the loading of MCM complexes onto the chromatin. In addition, downregulation of USP37 reduces DNA replication fork speed. Taken together, here we show that the deubiquitinase USP37 plays an important role in the regulation of DNA replication. Whether this is achieved via Cdt1, a central protein in this process, which we have shown to be stabilized by USP37, or via additional factors, remains to be tested.",

Mutations in the coding sequence of p53 occur frequently in human cancer and often result in single amino acid substitutions (missense mutations) in the DNA binding domain (DBD), blocking normal tumor suppressive functions. In addition to the loss of canonical functions, some missense mutations in p53 confer gain-of-function (GOF) activities to tumor cells. While many missense mutations in p53 cluster at six \u201chotspot\u201d amino acids, the majority of mutations in human cancer occur elsewhere in the DBD and at a much lower frequency. We report here that mutations at K120, a non-hotspot DNA contact residue, confer p53 with the previously unrecognized ability to bind and activate the transcription of the pro-survival TNFAIP8 gene. Mutant K120 p53 binds the TNFAIP8 locus at a cryptic p53 response element that is not occupied by wild-type p53. Furthermore, induction of TNFAIP8 is critical for the evasion of apoptosis by tumor cells expressing the K120R variant of p53. These findings identify induction of pro-survival targets as a mechanism of gain-of-function activity for mutant p53 and will likely broaden our understanding of this phenomenon beyond the limited number of GOF activities currently reported for hotspot mutants.",

Since it can be difficult to obtain appropriate tumor tissues for KRAS genotyping, alternative methods are required. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are believed to be representative of the tumor in real time. In this study we explored the capacity of a size-based device for capturing CTCs coupled with a multiplex KRAS screening assay using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). We showed that it is possible to detect a mutant ratio of 0.05% and less than one KRAS mutant cell per mL total blood with ddPCR compared to about 0.5% and 50\u201375 cells for TaqMeltPCR and HRM. Next, CTCs were isolated from the blood of 35 patients with CRC at various stage of the disease. KRAS genotyping was successful for 86% (30/35) of samples with a KRAS codon 12/13 mutant ratio of 57% (17/30). In contrast, only one patient was identified as KRAS mutant when size-based isolation was combined with HRM or TaqMeltPCR. KRAS status was then determined for the 26 available formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumors using standard procedures. The concordance between the CTCs and the corresponding tumor tissues was 77% with a sensitivity of 83%. Taken together, the data presented here suggest that is feasible to detect KRAS mutations in CTCs from blood samples of CRC patients which are predictive for those found in the tumor. The minimal invasive nature of this procedure in combination with the high sensitivity of ddPCR might provide in the future an opportunity to monitor patients throughout the course of disease on multiple levels including early detection, prognosis, treatment and relapse as well as to obtain mechanistic insight with respect to tumor invasion and metastasis.",

In this study, we tested SAHA sensitivity in 26 B-cell lymphoma cell lines and determined SAHA-interacting proteins in SAHA resistant and sensitive cell lines employing a SAHA capture compound (CC) and mass spectrometry (CCMS). In addition, we performed exome mutation analysis. Candidate validation was done by expression analysis and knock-out experiments.An integrated network analysis revealed that the Src tyrosine kinase Gardner-Rasheed feline sarcoma viral (v-fgr) oncogene homolog (FGR) is associated with SAHA resistance. FGR was specifically captured by the SAHA-CC in resistant cells. In line with this observation, we found that FGR expression was significantly higher in SAHA resistant cell lines. As functional proof, CRISPR/Cas9 mediated FGR knock-out in resistant cells increased SAHA sensitivity. In silico analysis of B-cell lymphoma samples (n\u00a0=\u00a01200) showed a wide range of FGR expression indicating that FGR expression might help to stratify patients, which clinically benefit from SAHA therapy.In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis of SAHA-interacting proteins highlights FGR as a factor involved in SAHA resistance in B-cell lymphoma.",

Geriatric skin is deficient in IGF-1 expression resulting in an aberrant IGF-1R-dependent UVB response which contributes to the development of aging-associated squamous cell carcinoma. Furthermore, our lab and others have reported that geriatric keratinocytes repair UVB-induced DNA damage less efficiently than young adult keratinocytes. Here, we show that IGF-1R activation influences DNA damage repair in UVB-irradiated keratinocytes. Specifically, in the absence of IGF-1R activation, the rate of DNA damage repair following UVB-irradiation was significantly slowed (using immortalized human keratinocytes) or inhibited (using primary human keratinocytes). Furthermore, inhibition of IGF-1R activity in human skin, using either ex\u00a0vivo explant cultures or in\u00a0vivo xenograft models, suppressed DNA damage repair. Primary keratinocytes with an inactivated IGF-1R also exhibited lower steady-state levels of nucleotide excision repair mRNAs. These results suggest that deficient UVB-induced DNA repair in geriatric keratinocytes is due in part to silenced IGF-1R activation in geriatric skin and provide a mechanism for how the IGF-1 pathway plays a role in the initiation of squamous cell carcinoma in geriatric patients.",

     "abstract": "Alterations of the tumor suppressor Neurofibromatosis type II (NF2) have been reported in about 40% of Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) patients. NF2 (Merlin) deficiency leads to alterations of the Hippo pathway; resulting in activation of the oncogenic Yes Associated Protein-1 (YAP1). Our aim was to investigate the association between these alterations and clinical outcomes.Tissue microarrays composed of MPM tumors derived from 2 independent MPM cohorts were employed for this study. Immunohistochemical expression of Merlin, YAP1 and its target genes, Survivin and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were assessed in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Cohort 1 was comprised of 145 patients intended to be treated with chemotherapy (CTX) followed by extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP), thus both pre- and post-CTX tissues were available. Cohort 2 was comprised of 59 patients treated with EPP followed by intraoperative hyperthermic cisplatin and/or adjuvant CTX and/or radiotherapy. Marker expression was quantified by means of labeling index (%) for nuclear Survivin and by H-score for the other markers. The dichotomized marker expression was tested for the association with overall survival (OS) and freedom from recurrence (FFR).Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves revealed a significant association between low cytoplasmic Merlin expression in pre-induction CTX tissues of cohort 1 with shorter FFR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and OS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The same tendency was observed in the chemotherapy na\u00efve tissues obtained during EPP of cohort 2. Low nuclear Merlin expression in post-CTX tissues (available from cohort 1 only) was associated with shorter FFR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and OS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). High nuclear Survivin labeling indices in both pre- and post-CTX tissues of cohort 1 was associated with shorter FFR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In cohort 2, this was associated with both FFR and OS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.046 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.002, respectively). In multivariate analysis, low expression of cytoplasmic Merlin remained an independent prognosticator for shorter FFR of cohort 1 [hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a00.5, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.3\u20130.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001] and OS [HR\u00a0=\u00a00.5, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.3\u20131, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04]. High Survivin labeling index was an independent prognostic factor for shorter FFR in patients from cohort 1 [HR\u00a0=\u00a03.4, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.7\u20136.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006] and shorter OS in patients from cohort 2 [HR\u00a0=\u00a02.35, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.27\u20134.33, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006].Our findings uncover the significance of Merlin protein expression and Survivin labeling index as prognosticators for poor clinical outcome in two independent MPM cohorts.

     "abstract": "It is well established that lncRNAs are aberrantly expressed in cancer where they have been shown to act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. RNA profiling of 314 colorectal adenomas/adenocarcinomas and 292 adjacent normal colon mucosa samples using RNA-sequencing demonstrated that the snoRNA host gene 16 (SNHG16) is significantly up-regulated in adenomas and all stages of CRC. SNHG16 expression was positively correlated to the expression of Wnt-regulated transcription factors, including ASCL2, ETS2, and c-Myc. In\u00a0vitro abrogation of Wnt signaling in CRC cells reduced the expression of SNHG16 indicating that SNHG16 is regulated by the Wnt pathway. Silencing of SNHG16 resulted in reduced viability, increased apoptotic cell death and impaired cell migration. The SNHG16 silencing particularly affected expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. A connection between SNHG16 and genes involved in lipid metabolism was also observed in clinical tumors. Argonaute CrossLinking and ImmunoPrecipitation (AGO-CLIP) demonstrated that SNHG16 heavily binds AGO and has 27 AGO/miRNA target sites along its length, indicating that SNHG16 may act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) \u201csponging\u201d miRNAs off their cognate targets. Most interestingly, half of the miRNA families with high confidence targets on SNHG16 also target the 3\u2032UTR of Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase (SCD). SCD is involved in lipid metabolism and is down-regulated upon SNHG16 silencing. In conclusion, up-regulation of SNHG16 is a frequent event in CRC, likely caused by deregulated Wnt signaling. In\u00a0vitro analyses demonstrate that SNHG16 may play an oncogenic role in CRC and that it affects genes involved in lipid metabolism, possible through ceRNA related mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "Tumour suppressor p53, a master transcriptional regulator determines cell fate through preferential activation/repression of a myriad of genes during stress. Till date, activation and preferential binding of p53 on different promoters was reported to be influenced by the nature, strength and duration of stress which mediates its post translational modifications. Cisplatin, a widely used cytotoxic drug represses PIK3CA promoter activity and attenuates PI3K/AKT cell survival pathway through p53 activation in sensitive cells. However, very little is understood about the overall mechanism of p53-PIK3CA interaction and influence of p53 on the transcriptional status of PIK3CA during cisplatin resistance. Here we showed that cisplatin could dynamically alter p53 occupancy between the p53 binding sequences present in PIK3CA promoter in ovarian and breast cancer cells. This altered occupancy is dictated by higher acetylation and hyper-phosphorylation at serine 15, serine 20 and serine 46 residues. Interestingly, cisplatin resistant cells when challenged with cisplatin demonstrated abolished PIK3CA promoter attenuation, low level of p53 binding, and loss of p53 serine 46 phosphorylation. A phosphorylation deficient S46A mutant failed to repress PIK3CA in p53 deficient cells. Elevated expression of Bcl2, P27 and cFLIP indicated a pro-survival state in these resistant cells. Non-invasive real time imaging using two different luciferase reporters showed that cisplatin could simultaneously induce PIK3CA attenuation and p53 activation with growth regression in sensitive tumours but not in the resistant tumours where only low level of p53 activation and sustained growth was observed. This is the first report on phosphorylation of p53 serine 46 as a modulator of p53-PIK3CA promoter interaction which influences altered binding of p53 at different consensus sequences in the same promoter in response to chemotherapeutic stress. Absence of such modulation in resistant cellular milieu influences cellular homoeostasis in platinum-resistant cells probably due to altered post translational modification of p53.",

MicroRNA-seq data for 51 patients whose treatment included bevacizumab in the BELOB trial were used as an independent validation cohort.Using penalized regression we identified 8 microRNAs as potential predictors of overall survival in the training set.

Hence SS1P, a mesothelin-targeted immunotoxin, could offer valuable treatment options for these patients, but its use in solid tumor therapy is hampered by high immunogenicity and non-specific toxicity. To overcome both obstacles we developed RG7787, a de-immunized cytotoxic fusion protein comprising a humanized SS1 Fab fragment and a truncated, B-cell epitope silenced, 24 kD fragment of Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE24). Reactivity of RG7787 with sera from immunotoxin-treated patients was >1000 fold reduced. In\u00a0vitro RG7787 inhibited cell viability of lung cancer cell lines with picomolar potency. The pharmacokinetic properties of RG7787 in rodents were comparable to SS1P, yet it was tolerated up to 10 fold better without causing severe vascular leak syndrome or hepatotoxicity. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model developed based on NCI-H596 xenograft studies showed that for RG7787 and SS1P, their in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo potencies closely correlate. At optimal doses of 2\u20133\u00a0mg/kg RG7787 is more efficacious than SS1P. Even large, well established tumors (600\u00a0mm3) underwent remission during three treatment cycles with RG7787. Also in two patient-derived lung cancer xenograft models, Lu7336 and Lu7187, RG7787 showed anti-tumor efficacy. In monotherapy two treatment cycles were moderately efficacious in the Lu7336 model but showed good anti-tumor activity in the KRAS mutant Lu7187 model (26% and 80% tumor growth inhibition, respectively).

Therefore, CTC from metastatic breast cancer patients with HER2-negative primary tumors screened for the prospective randomized phase III trial DETECT III were explored for their HER2 status and the presence of PIK3CA mutations. Detection and characterization of HER2 expression of CTC were conducted with the CellSearch\u00ae system. Fifteen of 179 CTC-positive patients (8.4%) contained \u22651 CTC with strong HER2 expression. Genomic DNA from individual CTC isolated by micromanipulation was propagated by whole genome amplification and analyzed for PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20 by Sanger sequencing. One or more CTC/7.5\u00a0mL were detected in 179/290 patients (61.7%). In 109 patients (34.8%), \u22655 CTC/7.5\u00a0mL were found.

Its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is still debated; most reports support that PPAR\u03b3 reduced expression is associated with poor prognosis. We employed 2-Dimensional Differential InGel Electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) followed by Liquid Chromatography (LC)-tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS/MS) to identify differentially expressed proteins and the molecular pathways underlying PPAR\u03b3 expression in CRC progression. We identified several differentially expressed proteins in HT29 and HCT116 CRC cells and derived clones either silenced or overexpressing PPAR\u03b3, respectively. In Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) they showed reciprocal relation with PPAR\u03b3 and a strong relationship with networks linked to cell death, growth and survival. Interestingly, five of the identified proteins, ezrin (EZR), isoform C of prelamin-A/C (LMNA), alpha-enolase (ENOA), prohibitin (PHB) and RuvB-like 2 (RUVBL2) were shared by the two cell models with opposite expression levels, suggesting a possible regulation by PPAR\u03b3. mRNA and western blot analysis were undertaken to obtain a technical validation and confirm the expression trend observed by 2-D DIGE data. We associated EZR upregulation with increased cell surface localization in PPAR\u03b3-overexpressing cells by flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining. We also correlated EZR and PPAR\u03b3 expression in our series of CRC specimens and the expression profiling of all five proteins levels in the publicly available colon cancer genomic data from Oncomine and Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) datasets.

BRB Array tools class comparison was performed to define miRs and mRNAs whose expression associate with PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 status. Spearman correlations established miR\u2013mRNA pairs and mRNAs with related expression. Next, a third dataset of 25 breast cancer patients receiving neo-adjuvant letrozole was evaluated, to compare expression levels of identified miRs and mRNAs in biopsies before and after treatment. Finally, to identify potential biomarkers miR and mRNA levels were related with overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) after first-line AI therapy.Expression of 3 miRs (miR-449a, miR-205-5p, miR-301a-3p) and 9 mRNAs (CCNO, FAM81B, LRG1, NEK10, PLCL1, PGR, SERPINA3, SORBS2, VTCN1) was related to the PIK3CA status in both datasets. All except miR-301a-3p had an increased expression in tumors with PIK3CA mutations. Validation in a publicly available dataset showed that LRG1, PGR, and SERPINA3 levels were decreased after neo-adjuvant AI-treatment. Six miR\u2013mRNA pairs correlated significantly and stepdown analysis of all 12 factors revealed 3 mRNAs (PLCL1, LRG1, FAM81B) related to PFS. Further analyses showed LRG1 and PLCL1 expression to be unrelated with luminal subtype and to associate with OS and with PFS, the latter independent from traditional predictive factors.We showed in two datasets of ER positive and luminal breast tumors that the expression of 3 miRs and 9 mRNAs associate with the PIK3CA status. Expression of LRG1 is independent of luminal (A or B) subtype, decreased after neo-adjuvant AI-treatment, and is proposed as potential biomarker for AI therapy outcome.",

Resistance has been attributed to an acquired or selected cancer stem cell phenotype. Here we report the histone deacetylase inhibitor apicidin (APC) or ER stressor thapsigargin (TG) potentiate paclitaxel (TXL)-induced apoptosis in PCa cells and limit accumulation of cancer stem cells. TXL-induced responses were modulated in the presence of TG with increased accumulation of cells at G1-phase, rearrangement of the cytoskeleton, and changes in cytokine release. Cytoskeletal rearrangement was associated with modulation of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial unfolded protein response leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and release of proapoptotic proteins from mitochondria. TXL in combination with APC or TG enhanced caspase activation. Importantly, TXL in combination with TG induced caspase activation and apoptosis in X-ray resistant LNCaP cells. Increased release of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) was observed while phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin level was suppressed with TXL combination treatments. This was accompanied by a decrease in the CD44+CD133+ cancer stem cell-like population, suggesting treatment affects cancer stem cell properties. Taken together, combination treatment with TXL and either APC or TG induces efficient apoptosis in both proliferating and cancer stem cells, suggesting this therapeutic combination may overcome drug resistance and recurrence in PCa.",

One of the key steps during tumor metastasis is tumor cell migration which requires actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Among the critical actin cytoskeletal protrusion structures are antenna-like filopodia. Fascin protein is the main actin-bundling protein in filopodia. Here we report the development of fascin-specific small-molecules that inhibit the interaction between fascin and actin. These inhibitors block the in\u00a0vitro actin-binding and actin-bundling activities of fascin, tumor cell migration and tumor metastasis in mouse models. Mechanistically, these inhibitors likely occupy one of the actin-binding sites, reduce the binding of actin filaments, and thus lead to the inhibition of the bundling activity of fascin. At the cellular level, these inhibitors impair actin cytoskeletal reorganization. Our data indicate that target-specific anti-fascin agents will have great potential for treating metastatic tumors.",

In order to increase the cross-studies reliability, we attempted to reduce and to control the circulating miRNA expression variability between patients. First, to maximize profiling signals and to reduce miRNA expression variability, three isolation kits were compared and the NucleoSpin\u00ae kit provided higher miRNA concentrations than the other widely used kits. Second, to control inter-sample variability during the profiling step, the exogenous miRNAs normalization method commonly used for RT-qPCR validation step was adapted to microarray experiments. Importantly, exogenous miRNAs presented two-fold lower inter-sample variability than the widely used endogenous miR-16-5p reflecting that the latter is subject to both biological and technical variability. Although Caenorhabditis elegans miRNAs isolation yields were heterogeneous, they correlated to each other and to their geometrical mean across samples. The normalization based on the geometrical mean of three exogenous miRNAs increased the correlation up-to 0.97 between the microarrays and individual RT-qPCR steps of circulating miRNAs expression. Overall, this new strategy open new avenue to identify reliable circulating miRNA signatures for translation into clinical practice.",

At physiological levels of expression, i.e. those found in normal mammary tissues, KLK6 acts as a tumor suppressor in human breast cancer. However, aberrant overexpression of KLK6 (i.e. 50\u2013100-fold higher than normal), a characteristic of a subset of human breast cancers is associated with increased tumorigenicity (Pampalakis et\u00a0al. Cancer Res 69:3779\u20133787, 2009). Here, we stably transfected KLK6-non-expressing MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with the full-length KLK6 cDNA to overexpress KLK6 at levels comparable to those observed in patients, and investigated potential oncogenic miRNA networks regulated by these abnormally high KLK6 expression levels and increased activity of this serine protease. A number of miRNAs that are upregulated (e.g. miR-146a) or downregulated (e.g. miR-34a) via KLK6-induced alterations in the miRNA biogenesis machinery were identified. Integrated experimental and bioinformatics analyses identified convergent miRNA networks targeting the cell cycle, MYC, MAPK, and other signaling pathways. In large clinical datasets, significant correlations between KLK6 and downstream MAPK and MYC targets at both the RNA and protein levels was confirmed, as well as negative correlation with GATA3. It was also demonstrated that KLK6 overexpression and likely its proteolytic activity is associated with alterations in downstream miRNAs and their targets, and these differ with the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. The data partly explains the different characteristics of breast cancer subtypes. Importantly, we introduce a combined KLK6-CDKN1B+MYC+CDKN1C score for prediction of long-term patient survival outcomes, with higher scores indicating poor survival.",

Here, we report that gain-of-function mutant p53 proteins inhibit the autophagic pathway favoring antiapoptotic effects as well as proliferation of pancreas and breast cancer cells. We found that mutant p53 significantly counteracts the formation of autophagic vesicles and their fusion with lysosomes throughout the repression of some key autophagy-related proteins and enzymes as BECN1 (and P-BECN1), DRAM1, ATG12, SESN1/2 and P-AMPK with the concomitant stimulation of mTOR signaling. As a paradigm of this mechanism, we show that atg12 gene repression was mediated by the recruitment of the p50 NF-\u03baB/mutant p53 protein complex onto the atg12 promoter. Either mutant p53 or p50 NF-\u03baB depletion downregulates atg12 gene expression. We further correlated the low expression levels of autophagic genes (atg12, becn1, sesn1, and dram1) with a reduced relapse free survival (RFS) and distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) of breast cancer patients carrying TP53 gene mutations conferring a prognostic value to this mutant p53-and autophagy-related signature. Interestingly, the mutant p53-driven mTOR stimulation sensitized cancer cells to the treatment with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. All these results reveal a novel mechanism through which mutant p53 proteins promote cancer cell proliferation with the concomitant inhibition of autophagy.",

Thus, investigating the transcriptional profiles of CTCs might help to identify therapy resistant tumor cells and to overcome treatment failure. For this purpose, we established a multi-marker panel for the molecular characterization of single CTCs, detecting epithelial (EpCAM, Muc-1, CK5/7), EMT (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snai1/2, CD117, CD146, CD49f) and stem cell (CD44, ALDH1A1, Nanog, SOX2, Notch1/4, Oct4, Lin28) associated transcripts.First primer specificity and PCR-performance of the multiplex-RT-PCRs were successfully validated on genomic DNA and cDNA isolated from OvCar3 cells. The assay sensitivity of the epithelial panel was evaluated by adding defined numbers of tumor cells into the blood of healthy donors and performing a subsequent immunomagnetic tumor cell enrichment (AdnaTest OvarianCancerSelect), resulting in a 100% concordance for the epithelial markers EpCAM and Muc-1 to the AdnaTest OvarianCancerDetect. Additionally, by processing blood from ovarian cancer patients, high assay sensitivity could be verified. In blood of healthy donors no signals for epithelial markers were detected, for EMT and stem cell markers, however, signals were obtained mainly originating from leukocytes which calls for single cell analysis.To that aim by using the ovarian cancer cell line OvCar3, we successfully established a workflow enabling the characterization of single CTCs. It consists of a density gradient-dependent enrichment for nucleated cells, a depletion of CD45-positive cells of hematopoietic origin followed by immunofluorescent labeling of CTCs by EpCAM and Muc-1. Single CTCs are then isolated by micromanipulation and processed for panel gene expression profiling. Finally, fifteen single CTCs from three ovarian cancer patients were analyzed and found to be positive for stem cell (CD44, ALDH1A1, Nanog, Oct4) and EMT markers (N-cadherin, Vimentin, Snai2, CD117, CD146). Albeit, inter-cellular and intra/inter-patient heterogeneity and co-expression of epithelial, mesenchymal and stem cell transcripts on the same CTC was observed.We have established a robust workflow to perform sensitive single cell panel gene expression analysis without the need of pre-amplification steps.

To identify key molecules related with pulmonary metastasis of pediatric osteosarcomas, we analyzed high-throughput miRNA expression in a cohort of 11 primary tumors and 15 lung metastases. Results were further validated with an independent cohort of 10 primary tumors and 6 metastases. In parallel, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of activated signaling pathways in 36 primary osteosarcomas. Only phospho-AKT associated with lower overall survival in primary tumors, supporting its role in osteosarcoma progression. CTNNB1 expression also associated with lower overall survival but was not strong enough to be considered an independent variable. Interestingly, miR-200c was overexpressed in lung metastases, implicating an inhibitory feed-back loop to PI3K-AKT. Moreover, transfection of miR200c-mimic in U2-OS cells reduced phospho-AKT levels but increased cellular migration and proliferation. Notably, miR-200c expression strongly correlated with miR-141 and with the osteogenic inhibitor miR-375, all implicated in epithelial to mesenchymal transition. These findings contrast epithelial tumors where reduced miR-200c expression promotes metastasis. Indeed, we noted that osteosarcoma cells in the lung also expressed the epithelial marker CDH1, revealing a change in their mesenchymal phenotype. We propose that miR-200c upregulation occurs late in osteosarcoma progression to provide cells with an epithelial phenotype that facilitates their integration in the metastatic lung niche. Thus, our findings identify phospho-AKT in the primary tumor and miR-200c later during tumor progression as prognostic molecules and potential therapeutic targets to prevent progression and metastasis of pediatric osteosarcomas.",

     "abstract": "Treating cancer is one of the big challenges of this century and it has become evident that single chemotherapeutic treatment is rarely effective. As tumors often carry multiple mutations using combination therapy which addresses different targets seems therefore more beneficial. One of the most frequently mutated genes in tumors is the tumor suppressor p53. Significant work has been put in the development of p53 activators, which are now in clinical studies against diverse cancers. Recently, we could show that inhibition of V-ATPase, a multisubunit proton pump, by archazolid induces p53 protein levels in cancer cells. In this study, we provide evidence that the combination of archazolid with the p53 activator nutlin-3a is synergistically inducing cell death in different p53 wild type tumor cell lines. Mechanistically, this effect could presumably be attributed to reduction of glycolysis as TIGAR mRNA levels were increased and glucose uptake and Glut1 protein levels were reduced. In addition, combination treatment highly activated pro-apoptotic pathways including IGFBP3 and Bax inducing caspase-9 and PARP cleavage. Remarkably, combination of archazolid and nutlin-3a was more efficient in reducing tumor growth compared to single dose treatment in a U87MG mouse model in\u00a0vivo. Hence, our findings suggest the combination of archazolid and nutlin-3a as a highly promising strategy for the treatment of p53 wild type tumors.",

In the current study, we examined the implications of bile acids (BA), an important component of bile, on the pathophysiology of PC and investigated their mechanistic association in tumor-promoting functions. Integration of results from PC patient samples and autochthonous mouse models showed an elevated levels of BA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in serum samples compared to healthy controls. Similarly, an elevated BA levels was observed in pancreatic juice derived from PC patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than non-pancreatic non-healthy (NPNH) controls, further establishing the clinical association of BA with the pathogenesis of PC. The tumor-promoting functions of BA were established by observed transcriptional upregulation of oncogenic MUC4 expression. Luciferase reporter assay revealed distal MUC4 promoter as the primary responsive site to BA. In silico analysis recognized two c-Jun binding sites at MUC4 distal promoter, which was biochemically established using ChIP assay. Interestingly, BA treatment led to an increased transcription and activation of c-Jun in a FAK-dependent manner. Additionally, BA receptor, namely FXR, which is also upregulated at transcriptional level in PC patient samples, was demonstrated as an upstream molecule in BA-mediated FAK activation, plausibly by regulating Src activation. Altogether, these results demonstrate that elevated levels of BA increase the tumorigenic potential of PC cells by inducing FXR/FAK/c-Jun axis to upregulate MUC4 expression, which is overexpressed in pancreatic tumors and is known to be associated with progression and metastasis of PC.",

FKBP51 and FKBP52 are the best characterized Hsp90-bound immunophilins first described associated to steroid-receptors. The reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase, hTERT, is also an Hsp90 client-protein and is highly expressed in cancer cells, where it is required to compensate the loss of telomeric DNA after each successive cell division. Because FKBP51 is also a highly expressed protein in cancer tissues, we analyzed its potential association with hTERT\u00b7Hsp90 complexes and its possible biological role. In this study it is demonstrated that both immunophilins, FKBP51 and FKBP52, co-immunoprecipitate with hTERT. The Hsp90 inhibitor radicicol disrupts the heterocomplex and favors the partial cytoplasmic relocalization of hTERT in similar manner as the overexpression of the TPR-domain peptide of the immunophilin. While confocal microscopy images show that FKBP51 is primarily localized in mitochondria and hTERT is totally nuclear, upon the onset of oxidative stress, FKBP51 (but not FKBP52) becomes mostly nuclear colocalizing with hTERT, and longer exposure times to peroxide favors hTERT export to mitochondria. Importantly, telomerase activity of hTERT is significantly enhanced by FKBP51. These observations support the emerging role assigned to FKBP51 as antiapoptotic factor in cancer development and progression, and describe for the first time the potential role of this immunophilin favoring the clonal expansion by enhancing telomerase activity.",

Unbiased genomic and proteomic screenings using ovarian cancer cell lines of different genetic backgrounds and sensitivities to platinum led to the identification of two key genes upregulated by mifepristone and involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR): the master chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), glucose regulated protein (GRP) of 78\u00a0kDa, and the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein homologous transcription factor (CHOP). GRP78 and CHOP were upregulated by mifepristone in ovarian cancer cells regardless of p53 status and platinum sensitivity. Further studies revealed that the three UPR-associated pathways, PERK, IRE1\u03b1, and ATF6, were activated by mifepristone. Also, the synthetic steroid acutely increased mRNA translation rate, which, if prevented, abrogated the splicing of XBP1 mRNA, a non-translatable readout of IRE1\u03b1 activation. Moreover, mifepristone increased LC3-II levels due to increased autophagic flux. When the autophagic\u2013lysosomal pathway was inhibited with chloroquine, mifepristone was lethal to the cells. Lastly, doses of proteasome inhibitors that are inadequate to block the activity of the proteasomes, caused cell death when combined with mifepristone; this phenotype was accompanied by accumulation of poly-ubiquitinated proteins denoting proteasome inhibition. The stimulation by mifepristone of ER stress and autophagic flux offers a therapeutic opportunity for utilizing this compound to sensitize ovarian cancer cells to proteasome or lysosome inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 plays a critical role in suppressing cancer growth and progression and is an attractive target for the development of new targeted therapies. We synthesized several indolo-pyrido-isoquinolin based alkaloids to activate p53 function and examined their therapeutic efficacy using NCI-60 screening. Here, we provide molecular evidence that one of these compounds, 11-methoxy-2,3,4,13-tetrahydro-1H-indolo[2\u2032,3\u2032:3,4]pyrido[1,2-b]isoquinolin-6-ylium-bromide (termed P18 or NSC-768219) inhibits growth and clonogenic potential of cancer cells. P18 treatment results in downregulation of mesenchymal markers and concurrent upregulation of epithelial markers as well as inhibition of migration and invasion. Experimental epithelial\u2013mesenchymal-transition (EMT) induced by exposure to TGF\u03b2/TNF\u03b1 is also completely reversed by P18. Importantly, P18 also inhibits mammosphere-formation along with a reduction in the expression of stemness factors, Oct4, Nanog and Sox2. We show that P18 induces expression, phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 in cancer cells. P18-mediated induction of p53 leads to increased nuclear localization and elevated expression of p53 target genes. Using isogenic cancer cells differing only in p53 status, we show that p53 plays an important role in P18-mediated alteration of mesenchymal and epithelial genes, inhibition of migration and invasion of cancer cells. Furthermore, P18 increases miR-34a expression in p53-dependent manner and miR-34a is integral for P18-mediated inhibition of growth, invasion and mammosphere-formation. miR-34a mimics potentiate P18 efficacy while miR-34a antagomirs antagonize P18. Collectively, these data provide evidence that P18 may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the inhibition of growth and progression of breast cancer and p53-miR-34a axis is important for P18 function.",

     "abstract": "Treatment of unresectable primary cancer and their distant metastases, with the liver representing one of the most frequent location, is still plagued by insufficient treatment success and poor survival rates. The Sigma-2 receptor is preferentially expressed on many tumor cells making it an appealing target for therapy. Thus, we developed a potential targeted drug conjugate consisting of the Sigma-2 receptor ligand SW43 and Doxorubicin (SW43-DOX) for systemic cancer therapy and for locoregional treatment of primary and secondary liver malignancies when loaded onto drug-eluting bead (DEB) which was compared in\u00a0vitro to the treatment with Doxorubicin alone.SW43-DOX binds specifically to the Sigma-2 receptor expressed on hepatocellular (Hep G2, Hep 3B), pancreatic (Panc-1) and colorectal (HT-29) carcinoma cell lines with high affinity and subsequent early specific internalization. Free SW43-DOX showed superior concentration and time depended cancer toxicity than treatment with Doxorubicin alone. Action mechanisms analysis revealed an apoptotic cell death with increased caspase 3/7 activation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Only ROS scavenging with \u03b1-Tocopherol, but not the caspase inhibition (Z-VAD-FMK), partly reverted the effect. SW43-DOX could successfully be loaded onto DEB and showed prolonged eluting kinetics compared to Doxorubicin. SW43-DOX loaded DEB vs. Doxorubicin loaded DEB showed a significantly greater time dependent toxicity in all cell lines. In conclusion, the novel conjugate SW43-DOX\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0loading onto DEB is a promising drug delivery platform for targeted systemic and locoregional cancer therapy.",

In the present study, our clinical data showed that the expression of G-protein coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) is negatively associated with lymph node metastasis, high-grade tumor and fibronectin (FN) expression while positively associated with the favorable outcome in 135 TNBC patients. In our experimental studies, both the in\u00a0vitro migration and invasion of TNBC cells were inhibited by GPER specific agonist G-1, through the suppression of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). The G-1 treatment also reduced the phosphorylation, nuclear localization, and transcriptional activities of NF-\u03baB. While over expression of NF-\u03baB attenuated the action of G-1 in suppressing EMT. Our data further illustrated that the phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 by PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 mediated, at least partially, the inhibitory effect of G-1 on NF-\u03baB activities. It was further confirmed in a study of MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts in nude mice. The data showed that G-1 inhibited the in\u00a0vivo growth and invasive potential of TNBC via suppression of EMT. Our present study demonstrated that an activation of GPER pathway elicits tumor suppressive actions on TNBC, and supports the use of G-1 therapeutics for TNBC metastasis.",

     "abstract": "Development of resistance to platinum compounds significantly hinders successful ovarian cancer (OVCA) treatment. In tumor cells, dysregulated pH gradient across cell membranes is a key physiological mechanism of metastasis/chemo-resistance. These pH alterations are mediated by aberrant activation of key multi-subunit proton pumps, Vacuolar-ATPases (V-ATPases). In tumor cells, its \u2018a2\u2019 isoform (V-ATPase-V0a2) is a component of functional plasma\u2013membrane complex and promotes tumor invasion through tumor-acidification and immuno-modulation. Its involvement in chemo-resistance has not been studied. Here, we show that V-ATPase-V0a2 is over-expressed in acquired-cisplatin resistant OVCA cells (cis-A2780/cis-TOV112D). Of all the \u2018a\u2019 subunit isoforms, V-ATPase-V0a2 exhibited an elevated expression on plasma membrane of cisplatin-resistant cells compared to sensitive counterparts. Immuno-histochemistry revealed V-ATPase-V0a2 expression in both low grade (highly drug-resistant) and high grade (highly recurrent) human OVCA tissues indicating its role in a centralized mechanism of tumor resistance. In cisplatin resistant cells, shRNA mediated inhibition of V-ATPase-V0a2 enhanced sensitivity towards both cisplatin and carboplatin. This improved cytotoxicity was mediated by enhanced cisplatin-DNA-adduct formation and suppressed DNA-repair pathway, leading to enhanced apoptosis. Suppression of V0a2 activity strongly reduced cytosolic pH in resistant tumor cells, which is known to enhance platinum-associated DNA-damage. As an indicator of reduced metastasis and chemo-resistance, in contrast to plasma membrane localization, a diffused cytoplasmic localization of acidic vacuoles was observed in V0a2-knockdown resistant cells. Interestingly, pre-treatment with monoclonal V0a2-inhibitory antibody enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity in resistant cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that the isoform specific inhibition of V-ATPase-V0a2 could serve as a therapeutic strategy for chemo-resistant ovarian carcinoma and improve efficacy of platinum drugs.",

Meisoindigo is chemically related to the natural product indirubin and showed substantial efficiency in clinical chemotherapy for CML in China. However, its effect on PDAC is still unknown. Our results showed strong anti-proliferation effect of meisoindigo on gemcitabine-resistant PDACs. Using a recently established primary PDAC cell line, called Jopaca-1 with a larger CSCs population as model, we observed a reduction of CD133+ and ESA+/CD44+/CD24+ populations upon treatment and concomitantly a decreased expression of CSC-associated genes, and reduced cellular mobility and sphere formation. Investigating basic cellular metabolic responses, we detected lower oxygen consumption and glucose uptake, while intracellular ROS levels increased. This was effectively neutralized by the addition of antioxidants, indicating an essential role of the cellular redox balance. Further analysis on energy metabolism related signaling revealed that meisoindigo inhibited LKB1, but activated AMPK. Both of them were involved in cellular apoptosis. Additional in situ hybridization in tissue sections of PDAC patients reproducibly demonstrated co-expression and -localization of LKB1 and CD133 in malignant areas. Finally, we detected that CD133+/CD44+ were more vulnerable to meisoindigo, which could be mimicked by LKB1 siRNAs. Our results provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that LKB1 sustains the CSC population in PDACs and demonstrate a clear benefit of meisoindigo in treatment of gemcitabine-resistant cells. This novel mechanism may provide a promising new treatment option for PDAC.",

     "abstract": "Limitations of current diagnostic and prognostic tools for prostate cancer (PC) have led to over-diagnosis and over-treatment. Here, we investigate the biomarker potential of the SLC18A2 (VMAT2) gene for PC at three molecular levels. Thus, SLC18A2 promoter methylation was analyzed in 767 malignant and 78 benign radical prostatectomy (RP) samples using methylation-specific qPCR and Illumina 450K methylation microarray data. SLC18A2 transcript levels were assessed in 412 malignant and 45 benign RP samples using RNAseq data. SLC18A2 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 502 malignant and 305 benign RP samples. Cancer-specificity of molecular changes was tested using Mann\u2013Whitney U tests and/or receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Log rank, uni- and multivariate Cox regression tests were used for survival analyses. We found that SLC18A2 promoter hypermethylation was highly cancer-specific (area under the curve (AUC): 0.923\u20130.976) and associated with biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP in univariate analyses. SLC18A2 transcript levels were reduced in PC and had independent prognostic value for BCR after RP (multivariate HR 0.13, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Likewise, SLC18A2 protein was down-regulated in PC (AUC 0.898) and had independent prognostic value for BCR (multivariate HR 0.51, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Reduced SLC18A2 protein expression was also associated with poor overall survival in univariate analysis (HR 0.29, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Our results highlight SLC18A2 as a new promising methylation marker candidate for PC diagnosis. Furthermore, SLC18A2 expression (RNA and protein) showed promising prognostic potential beyond routine clinicopathological variables.

Although the functions of many miRNAs in breast cancer metastasis have been established, the role of others remains to be characterized. To identify additional miRNAs involved in metastasis, we performed a genetic screen by transducing a Lenti-miR\u2122 virus library into MCF-7\u00a0cells. Using transwell invasion assays we identified human miR-548j as an invasion-inducing miRNA. The endogenous levels of miR-548j expression in breast cancer cell lines were shown to correlate with invasiveness. Moreover, miR-548j was shown to stimulate breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, but had no effect on proliferation. Next, using a series of in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo experiments, we found that Tensin1 served as a direct and functional target of miR-548j. Both miR-548j and Tensin1 modulated the activation of Cdc42 to regulate cell invasion and siCdc42 or the selective Cdc42 inhibitor ML141 suppressed the pathway of miR-548j-mediated cell invasion. Furthermore, a strong correlation between miR-548j, Tensin1, metastasis and survival was observed using two sets of clinical breast cancer samples. Our findings demonstrate that miR-548j functions as a metastasis-promoting miRNA to regulate breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis by targeting Tensin1 and activating Cdc42, suggesting a potential therapeutic application in breast cancer.",

Here, we demonstrate that over-expression of WHSC1L1 is linked to over-expression of ER\u03b1 in SUM-44 breast cancer cells and in primary human breast cancers. Knock-down of WHSC1L1, particularly WHSC1L1-short, had a dramatic effect on ESR1 mRNA and ER\u03b1 protein levels. SUM-44\u00a0cells do not require exogenous estrogen for growth in\u00a0vitro; however, they are dependent on ER\u03b1 expression, as ESR1 knock-down or exposure to the selective estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant resulted in growth inhibition. ChIP-Seq experiments utilizing ER\u03b1 antibodies demonstrated extensive ER\u03b1 binding to chromatin in SUM-44\u00a0cells under estrogen-free conditions. ER\u03b1 bound to ERE and FOXA1 motifs under estrogen-free conditions and regulated expression of estrogen-responsive genes. Short-term treatment with estradiol enhanced binding of ER\u03b1 to chromatin and influenced expression of many of the same genes to which ER\u03b1 was bound under estrogen-free conditions. Finally, knock-down of WHSC1L1 in SUM-44\u00a0cells resulted in loss of ER\u03b1 binding to chromatin under estrogen-free conditions, which was restored upon exposure to estradiol. These results indicate the SUM-44\u00a0cells are a good model of a subset of luminal B breast cancers that have the 8p11-p12 amplicon, over-express WHSC1L1, and over-express ER\u03b1, but are independent of estrogen for binding to chromatin and regulation of gene expression. Breast cancers such as these, that are dependent on ER\u03b1 activity but independent of estradiol, are a major cause of breast cancer mortality.",

Here we conducted metabolic profiling of pre-malignant sympathetic ganglia and tumors derived from the TH-MYCN mouse model of neuroblastoma, compared to non-malignant ganglia from wildtype littermates. We found that metabolites involved in the biosynthesis of glutathione, the most abundant cellular antioxidant, were the most significantly upregulated metabolic pathway at tumor initiation, and progressively increased to meet the demands of tumorigenesis. A corresponding increase in the expression of genes involved in ribosomal biogenesis suggested that MYCN-driven transactivation of the protein biosynthetic machinery generated the necessary substrates to drive glutathione biosynthesis. Pre-malignant sympathetic ganglia from TH-MYCN mice had higher antioxidant capacity and required glutathione upregulation for cell survival, when compared to wildtype ganglia. Moreover, in\u00a0vivo administration of inhibitors of glutathione biosynthesis significantly delayed tumorigenesis when administered prophylactically and potentiated the anticancer activity of cytotoxic chemotherapy against established tumors.

Furthermore, targeting DNA repair defects by PARP1 inhibitors (PARPi) as a cancer treatment strategy is emerging yet requires suitable predictive biomarkers. To address these issues, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of multiple markers of DNA damage signalling, oxidative stress, DNA repair and cell cycle control pathways during progression of human prostate disease from benign hyperplasia, through intraepithelial neoplasia to CaP, complemented by genetic analyses of TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement and NQO1, an anti-oxidant factor and p53 protector. The DNA damage checkpoint barrier (\u03b3H2AX, pATM, p53) mechanism was activated during CaP tumorigenesis, albeit less and with delayed culmination compared to other cancers, possibly reflecting lower replication stress (slow proliferation despite cases of Rb loss and cyclin D1 overexpression) and progressive loss of ATM activator NKX3.1. Oxidative stress (8-oxoguanine lesions) and NQO1 increased during disease progression. NQO1 genotypes of 390 men did not indicate predisposition to CaP, yet loss of NQO1 in CaP suggested potential progression-opposing tumour suppressor role. TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement and PTEN loss, events sensitizing to PARPi, occurred frequently along with heterogeneous loss of DNA repair factors 53BP1, JMJD1C and Rev7 (all studied here for the first time in CaP) whose defects may cause resistance to PARPi. Overall, our results reveal an unorthodox DNA damage checkpoint barrier scenario in CaP tumorigenesis, and provide novel insights into oxidative stress and DNA repair, with implications for biomarker guidance of future targeted therapy of CaP.",

Here, we report that SOCS2 protein is significantly downregulated in OSCC patients and its levels are inversely correlated with miR-424-5p expression. We identified the SOCS2 protein, which modulates STAT5 activity, as a direct target of miR-424-5p. The miR-424-5p-induced STAT5 phosphorylation, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) expression, and cell migration and invasion were blocked by SOCS2 restoration, suggesting that miR-424-5p exhibits its oncogenic activity through negatively regulating SOCS2 levels. Furthermore, miR-424-5p expression could be induced by the cytokine IL-8 primarily through enhancing STAT5 transcriptional activity rather than NF-\u03baB signaling. Antagomir-mediated inactivation of miR-424-5p prevented the IL-8-induced cell migration and invasion, indicating that miR-424-5p is required for IL-8-induced cellular invasiveness. Taken together, these data indicate that STAT5-dependent expression of miR-424-5p plays an important role in mediating IL-8/STAT5/SOCS2 feedback loop, and scavenging miR-424-5p function using antagomir may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of OSCC.",

     "abstract": "The leukocyte antigen related (LAR) family of receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases has three members in humans \u2013 PTPRF, PTPRD and PTPRS \u2013 that have been implicated in diverse processes including embryonic development, inhibition of cell growth and axonal guidance. Mutations in the LAR family are associated with developmental defects such as cleft palate as well as various cancers including breast, neck, lung, colon and brain. Although this family of tyrosine phosphatases is important for many developmental processes, little is known of their substrates. This is partially due to functional redundancy within the LAR family, as deletion of a single gene in the LAR family does not have an appreciable phenotype, but a dual knockout is embryonically lethal in mouse models. To circumvent the inability to knockout multiple members of the LAR family in mouse models, we used a knockout of ptp-3, which is the only known ortholog of the LAR family in Caenorhabditis elegans and allows for the study of the LAR family at the organismal level. Using SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics, we identified 255 putative substrates of ptp-3, which included four of the nine known annotated substrates of the LAR family. A motif analysis of the identified phosphopeptides allowed for the determination of sequences that appear to be preferentially dephosphorylated. Finally, we discovered that kinases were overrepresented in the list of identified putative substrates and tyrosine residues whose phosphorylation is known to increase kinase activity were dephosphorylated by ptp-3. These data are suggestive of ptp-3 as a potential negative regulator of several kinase families, such as the mitogen activated kinases (MAPKs), and multiple tyrosine kinases including FER, MET, and NTRK2.",

The discovery of an effective anti-TNBC agent has been a challenge in oncology. In this study, fifty-eight ester derivatives (DETDs) with a novel sesquiterpene dilactone skeleton were organically synthesized from a bioactive natural product deoxyelephantopin (DET). Among them, DETD-35 showed potent antiproliferative activities against a panel of breast cancer cell lines including TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231, without inhibiting normal mammary cells M10. DETD-35 exhibited a better effect than parental DET on inhibiting migration, invasion, and motility of MDA-MB-231 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Comparative study of DETD-35, DET and chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (PTX) showed that PTX mainly caused a typical time-dependent G2/M cell-cycle arrest, while DETD-35 or DET treatment induced cell apoptosis. In\u00a0vivo efficacy of DETD-35 was evaluated using a lung metastatic MDA-MB-231 xenograft mouse model. DETD-35 significantly suppressed metastatic pulmonary foci information along with the expression level of VEGF and COX-2 in SCID mice. DETD-35 also showed a synergistic antitumor effect with PTX in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. This study suggests that the novel compound DETD-35 may have a potential to be further developed into a therapeutic or adjuvant agent for chemotherapy against metastatic TNBC.",

However, the short half-life of the Fab, due to its low molecular weight, is a severe limitation for the deployment in therapy. This issue was addressed by increasing the Fab molecular weight above the glomerular filtration threshold through the duplication of the constant domains, in tandem (DCD-1) or reciprocally swapped (DCD-2). The two newly engineered molecules showed biochemical properties comparable to the original MvDN30 in\u00a0vitro, acting as full Met antagonists, impairing Met phosphorylation and activation of downstream signaling pathways. As a consequence, Met-mediated biological responses were inhibited, including anchorage-dependent and -independent cell growth. In\u00a0vivo DCD-1 and DCD-2 showed a pharmacokinetic profile significantly improved over the original MvDN30, doubling the circulating half-life and reducing the clearance.

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 plays a key role in malignant transformation and tumor development. However, the frequency of p53 mutations within individual types of cancer is different, suggesting the existence of other mechanisms attenuating p53 tumor suppressor activity. Changes in upstream regulators of p53 such as MDM2 amplification and overexpression, expression of viral oncoproteins, estrogen receptor signaling, or changes in p53 transcriptional target genes were previously described in wild-type p53 tumors. We identified a novel pathway responsible for attenuation of p53 activity in human cancers. We demonstrate that AGR2, which is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and provides a poor prognosis, up-regulates DUSP10 which subsequently inhibits p38 MAPK and prevents p53 activation by phosphorylation. Analysis of human breast cancers reveals that AGR2 specifically provides a poor prognosis in ER+ breast cancers with wild-type p53 but not ER- or mutant p53 breast cancers, and analysis of independent data sets show that DUSP10 levels also have prognostic significance in this specific sub-group of patients. These data not only reveal a novel pro-oncogenic signaling pathway mediating resistance to DNA damaging agents in human tumors, but also has implications for designing alternative strategies for modulation of wild-type p53 activity in cancer therapy.",

We found that the activity of phospholipase D isoform 2 (PLD2) is highly increased in cancers with larger size and poor prognosis (MDA-MB-231 versus MCF-7 cells), so we determined if Snail or Slug were responsible for PLD2 gene transcription regulation. Unexpectedly, we found that PLD2 expression was positively regulated by Slug but negatively regulated by Snail. The differential effects are amplified in breast cancer cells over normal cells and with MDA-MB-231 more robustly than MCF-7. Slug putatively binds to the PLD2 promoter and transactivates it, which is negated when Slug and Snail compete with each other. Meanwhile, PLD2 has a negative effect on Snail expression and a positive effect on Slug, thus closing a feedback loop between the lipase and the transcription factors. Further, PA, the product of PLD2 enzymatic reaction, has profound effects on its own and it further regulates the transcription factors. Thus, we show for the first time that the overexpressed PLD2 in human breast tumors is regulated by Slug and Snail transcription factors. The newly uncovered feedback loops in highly invasive cancer cells have important implications in the process of EMT.",

     "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) have provided molecular targets for the development of novel, prognosis-improving agents in many cancers; however, resistances to these therapies occur. On the cellular level, one resistance mechanism is attributed to functional RTK redundancies and compensatory cross-signaling, leading to perception of RTKs as signaling and target networks. To provide a basis for better exploitation of this network in Ewing sarcoma, we generated comprehensive qPCR gene expression profiles of RTKs in Ewing sarcoma cell lines and 21 untreated primary tumors. Key findings confirm broad-spectrum RTK expressions with potential for signaling redundancy. Profile analyses with regard to patient risk-group further revealed several individual RTKs of interest. Among them, VEGFR3 and TIE1 showed high-level expressions and also were suggestive of poor prognosis in localized tumors; underscoring the relevance of angiogenic signaling pathways and tumor-stroma interactions in Ewing sarcoma. Of note, compared to localized disease, tumors derived from metastatic disease were marked by global high-level RTK expressions. Nine individual RTKs were significantly over-expressed, suggesting contributions to molecular mechanisms of metastasis. Of these, ROR1 is being pursued as therapeutic target in leukemias and carcinomas, but un-characterized in sarcomas. We demonstrate expression of ROR1 and its putative ligand Wnt5a in Ewing sarcomas, and of an active ROR1 protein variant in cell lines. ROR1 silencing impaired cell migration in\u00a0vitro. Therefore, ROR1 calls for further evaluation as a therapeutic target in metastatic Ewing sarcoma; and described as a pseudo-kinase with several isoforms, underlines these additional complexities arising in our understanding of RTK signaling networks.",

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have long been considered \u201chousekeeping\u201d genes with no relevance for cancer biology. Emerging evidence has challenged this assumption, suggesting that snoRNA expression is frequently modulated during cancer progression. Despite this, no study has systematically addressed the prognostic and functional significance of snoRNAs in PCa.We performed RNA Sequencing on paired metastatic/non-metastatic PCa xenografts derived from clinical specimens. The clinical significance of differentially expressed snoRNAs was further investigated in two independent primary PCa cohorts (131 and 43 patients, respectively). The snoRNA demonstrating the strongest association with clinical outcome was quantified in PCa patient-derived serum samples and its functional relevance was investigated in PCa cells via gene expression profiling, pathway analysis and gene silencing.Our comparison revealed 21 differentially expressed snoRNAs in the metastatic vs. non-metastatic xenografts. Of those, 12 were represented in clinical databases and were further analyzed. SNORA55 emerged as a predictor of shorter relapse-free survival (results confirmed in two independent databases). SNORA55 was reproducibly detectable in serum samples from PCa patients. SNORA55 silencing in PCa cell lines significantly inhibited cell proliferation and migration. Pathway analysis revealed that SNORA55 expression is significantly associated with growth factor signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in PCa.Our results demonstrate that SNORA55 up-regulation predicts PCa progression and that silencing this non-coding gene affects PCa cell proliferation and metastatic potential, thus positioning it as both a novel biomarker and therapeutic target.",

Cell viability (MTT assay), intracellular drug accumulation (liquid chromatography) apoptosis induction (apoptotic cell nuclei morphology, western blot analysis of PARP-1/caspase-9 cleavage and Bak/Bax activation) were evaluated. Kinome alterations were characterized by PathScan array and phospho-Src validated by western blotting.

Mel-flufen induced apoptosis seen as activation of Bak/Bax, cleavage of caspase-9/PARP-1 and induction of apoptotic cell nuclei morphology.

Immunohistochemical analysis of the putative mel-flufen biomarker ANPEP demonstrated prominent expression levels in tumours from 82 of 83 cystectomy patients.

However, genome stability is also surveilled by cell cycle checkpoints. An important issue is therefore whether hypoxia also can influence the DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoints. Here, we show that hypoxia (24\u00a0h 0.2% O2) alters the expression of several G2 checkpoint regulators, as examined by microarray gene expression analysis and immunoblotting of U2OS cells. While some of the changes reflected hypoxia-induced inhibition of cell cycle progression, the levels of several G2 checkpoint regulators, in particular Cyclin B, were reduced in G2 phase cells after hypoxic exposure, as shown by flow cytometric barcoding analysis of individual cells. These effects were accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of a Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) target in G2 phase cells after hypoxia, suggesting decreased CDK activity. Furthermore, cells pre-exposed to hypoxia showed increased G2 checkpoint arrest upon treatment with ionizing radiation. Similar results were found following other hypoxic conditions (\u223c0.03% O2 20\u00a0h and 0.2% O2 72\u00a0h).

     "abstract": "Type II germ cell tumors arise after puberty from a germ cell that was incorrectly programmed during fetal life. Failure of testicular germ cells to properly differentiate can lead to the formation of germ cell neoplasia in situ of the testis; this precursor cell invariably gives rise to germ cell cancer after puberty. The Nodal co-receptor Cripto is expressed transiently during normal germ cell development and is ectopically expressed in non-seminomas that arise from germ cell neoplasia in situ, suggesting that its aberrant expression may underlie germ cell dysregulation and hence germ cell cancer. Here we investigated methylation of the Cripto promoter in mouse germ cells and human germ cell cancer and correlated this with the level of CRIPTO protein expression. We found hypomethylation of the CRIPTO promoter in undifferentiated fetal germ cells, embryonal carcinoma and seminomas, but hypermethylation in differentiated fetal germ cells and the differentiated types of non-seminomas. CRIPTO protein was strongly expressed in germ cell neoplasia in situ along with embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor and seminomas. Further, cleaved CRIPTO was detected in media from seminoma and embryonal carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that cleaved CRIPTO may provide diagnostic indication of germ cell cancer. Accordingly, CRIPTO was detectable in serum from 6/15 patients with embryonal carcinoma, 5/15 patients with seminoma, 4/5 patients with germ cell neoplasia in situ cells only and in 1/15 control patients. These findings suggest that CRIPTO expression may be a useful serological marker for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes during germ cell cancer management.",

MYCN amplification is the most common genomic change associated with aggressive neuroblastoma and drugs targeting PI3K/AKT/mTOR, to activate MYCN oncoprotein degradation, are entering clinical evaluation. Our aim was to develop and validate pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers to evaluate both proof of mechanism and proof of concept for drugs that block PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity in children with neuroblastoma. We have addressed the issue of limited access to tumor biopsies for quantitative detection of protein biomarkers by optimizing a three-color fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) method to purify CD45\u2212/GD2+/CD56+ neuroblastoma cells from bone marrow. We then developed a novel quantitative measurement of MYCN protein in these isolated neuroblastoma cells, providing the potential to demonstrate proof of concept for drugs that inhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling in this disease. In addition we have established quantitative detection of three biomarkers for AKT pathway activity (phosphorylated and total AKT, GSK3\u03b2 and P70S6K) in surrogate platelet-rich plasma (PRP) from pediatric patients. Together our new approach to neuroblastoma cell isolation for protein detection and suite of PD assays provides for the first time the opportunity for robust, quantitative measurement of protein-based PD biomarkers in this pediatric patient population. These will be ideal tools to support clinical evaluation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway drugs and their ability to target MYCN oncoprotein in upcoming clinical trials in neuroblastoma.",

Blood, which can be sampled routinely, provides a means of inferring the current genetic status of patients' tumours via analysis of circulating tumour cells (CTCs) or circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). However, accurate assessment of both CTCs and ctDNA requires all blood cells to be maintained intact until samples are processed. This dictates for ctDNA analysis EDTA blood samples must be processed with 4\u00a0h of draw, severely limiting the use of ctDNA in multi-site trials. Here we describe a blood collection protocol that is amenable for analysis of both CTCs and ctDNA up to four days after blood collection. We demonstrate that yields of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) obtained from whole blood CellSave samples are equivalent to those obtained from conventional EDTA plasma processed within 4\u00a0h of blood draw. Targeted and genome-wide NGS revealed comparable DNA quality and resultant sequence information from cfDNA within CellSave and EDTA samples. We also demonstrate that CTCs and ctDNA can be isolated from the same patient blood sample, and give the same patterns of CNA enabling direct analysis of the genetic status of patients' tumours.In summary, our results demonstrate the utility of a simple approach that enabling robust molecular analysis of CTCs and cfDNA for genotype-directed therapies in multi-site clinical trials and represent a significant methodological improvement for clinical benefit.",

     "abstract": "Despite apparent resection of tumors, breast cancer patients often suffer relapse due to remnant dormant tumor cells. Although quiescence of cancer stem cells is thought as one of the mechanisms regulating dormancy, the mechanism underlying quiescence is unclear. Since \u0394Np63\u03b1, an isoform of p51/p63, is crucial in the maintenance of stem cells within mammary epithelium, we investigated its roles in the regulation of dormancy in normal and malignant breast cells. Inducible expression of \u0394Np63\u03b1 in MCF7 estrogen receptor positive (ER+) luminal breast cancer cells led to quiescence and acquisition of progenitor-like properties. Judging from mRNA-microRNA microarray analysis, activation of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling and inhibition of Wnt signaling emerged as prominent mechanisms underlying \u0394Np63\u03b1-dependent induction of quiescence and acquisition of stemness in MCF7. More interestingly, through Ingenuity Pathway analysis, we found for the first time that BRCA1 pathway was the most significantly downregulated pathway by \u0394Np63\u03b1 expression in quiescent MCF7 cells, where miR-205 was a downstream mediator. Furthermore, \u0394Np63\u03b1-expressing MCF7 cells exhibited resistance to paclitaxel and doxorubicin. Expression of \u0394Np63\u03b1 in normal MCF10A basal cells increased proliferation and stemness, but did not affect more aggressive luminal (T47D) and basal (MDA-MB-231) cells with p53 mutation. Gene expression datasets analyses suggested that \u0394Np63 expression is associated with relapse-free survival of luminal A/B-type patients, but not of the other subtypes. Our results established a cell type-specific function of \u0394Np63\u03b1 in induction of quiescence and downregulation of the BRCA1 pathway which suggested a role of \u0394Np63\u03b1 in the dormancy of luminal breast cancers.",

Given the limited number of elderly patients in previous studies, the aim of this study was to determine the prognostic effect of the molecular intrinsic subtypes in a large older breast cancer population.Older breast cancer patients with invasive, non-metastatic breast cancer with tumor material available for immunohistochemical determination of Ki67, EGFR, CK5/6 and HER-2 were included. ER and PR expression was retrieved from the pathology report. Molecular subtypes were: Luminal A, Luminal B, ERBB2, Basal-like and Unclassified. Primary endpoint was Relapse Free Period (RFP), taking into account the competing risk of mortality, and adjusted for the most important patient, tumor and treatment characteristics. Secondary endpoint was Relative Survival (RS).Overall, 1362 patients were included. Patients with a Luminal A subtype had the lowest risk of recurrence (11% at 5\u00a0yrs). Patients with a Basal (24% at 5yrs) or ERBB2 (34% at 5yrs) molecular breast tumor subtype had the highest risk of recurrence. The ERBB2 subtype had the worst prognosis in terms of RFP (SHR 2.07, 95% CI 1.35\u20133.20; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The worst RS was again observed for the ERBB2 subtype (48% at 10\u00a0yrs). In multivariable analyses, the relative excess risk of death for all molecular subtypes was significantly worse compared to the Luminal A subtype.Molecular intrinsic breast tumor subtypes have significant prognostic value in the elderly population, even after taking competing mortality into account.",

Interrogation of in\u00a0vitro ALK-positive NSCLC cell line models of acquired resistance to first and second-generation ALK inhibitors revealed acquired epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanisms.

Removing drug for 5 weeks from H3122 cell line that acquired resistance to ceritinib restored its sensitivity to ceritinib. In addition, HSP90 inhibitors ganetespib and 17-AAG were potent in inducing cell death in cell lines resistant to crizotinib and ceritinib. Taken together, EMT does not drive resistance to ALK inhibitors and HSP90 inhibition demonstrates more efficacy when further ALK inhibition may not.

Here, we pulled down and identified a novel COX-2 regulator, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2/B1), which could specifically bind to COX-2 core promoter and regulate tumor growth in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Knockdown of hnRNPA2/B1 by shRNA or siRNA downregulated COX-2 expression and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, and suppressed tumor cell growth in NSCLC cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Conversely, overexpression of hnRNPA2/B1 up-regulated the levels of COX-2 and PGE2 and promoted tumor cell growth. We also showed that hnRNPA2/B1 expression was positively correlated with COX-2 expression in NSCLC cell lines and tumor tissues, and the up-regulated expression of hnRNPA2/B1 and COX-2 predicted worse prognosis in NSCLC patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the activation of COX-2 expression by hnRNPA2/B1 was mediated through the cooperation with p300, a transcriptional co-activator, in NSCLC cells. The hnRNPA2/B1 could interact with p300 directly and be acetylated by p300. Exogenous overexpression of p300, but not its histone acetyltransferase (HAT) domain deletion mutation, augmented the acetylation of hnRNPA2/B1 and enhanced its binding on COX-2 promoter, thereby promoted COX-2 expression and lung cancer cell growth. Collectively, our results demonstrate that hnRNPA2/B1 promotes tumor cell growth by activating COX-2 signaling in NSCLC cells and imply that the hnRNPA2/B1/COX-2 pathway may be a potential therapeutic target for human lung cancers.",

We applied this combined therapy to two different GBM models using human U87 glioma cells and primary patient-derived GBM neural spheres in culture and in orthotopic GBM xenograft models in mice. In U87\u00a0cells, conditioned medium from AAV2-sTRAIL expressing cells combined with lan C induced 80% cell death. Similarly, lan C sensitized primary GBM spheres to sTRAIL causing over 90% cell death. In mice bearing intracranial U87 tumors treated with AAVrh.8-sTRAIL, administration of lan C caused a decrease in tumor-associated Fluc signal, while tumor size increased within days of stopping the treatment. Another round of lan C treatment re-sensitized GBM tumor to sTRAIL-induced cell death. AAVrh.8-sTRAIL treatment alone and combined with lanatoside C resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth and longer survival of mice bearing orthotopic invasive GBM brain tumors. In summary, AAV-sTRAIL combined with lanatoside C induced cell death in U87 glioma cells and patient-derived GBM neural spheres in culture and in\u00a0vivo leading to an increased in overall mice survival.",

Fifty-three blood samples were collected from 14 prospectively recruited patients prior to chemotherapy (gemcitabine or FOLFIRINOX) and subsequently every month during treatment. Samples were processed by density centrifugation and plasma DNA isolation. A Peptide\u2013nucleic acid\u2013clamp PCR was then used to detect KRAS mutations (present in >90% of pancreatic cancers) as a surrogate marker for ctDNA. Plasma samples from 29 healthy individuals were analyzed as a reference group. Results were compared to conventional monitoring measures and survival data. Median follow-up time was 3.7 months (range 0.6\u201312.9 months).Ten (71%) patients had a positive KRAS status in the plasma samples obtained prior to chemotherapy, indicating the presence of ctDNA. Among the patients who were ctDNA-positive before chemotherapy, nine (90%) experienced disease progression during follow-up, compared to one (25%) of four ctDNA-negative patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The pre-therapy ctDNA level was a statistically significant predictor of both progression-free and overall survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.014 and 0.010, respectively). Of the 14 patients, ten had \u22652 follow-up samples; in several of these patients, the ctDNA level changed substantially during the course of chemotherapy. Changes in ctDNA levels corresponded both with radiological follow-up data and CA19-9 levels for several patients.This pilot study supports the hypothesis that ctDNA may be used as a marker for monitoring treatment efficacy and disease progression in pancreatic cancer patients.

     "abstract": "During the process of metastasis, which is the leading cause of cancer-related death, cancer cells dissociate from primary tumors, migrate to distal sites, and finally colonize, eventually leading to the formation of metastatic tumors. The migrating tumor cells in circulation, e.g., those found in peripheral blood (PB) or bone marrow (BM), are called circulating tumor cells (CTCs). CTCs in the BM are generally called disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). Many studies have reported the detection and characterization of CTCs to facilitate early diagnosis of relapse or metastasis and improve early detection and appropriate treatment decisions. Initially, epithelial markers, such as EpCAM and cytokeratins (CKs), identified using immunocytochemistry or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to identify CTCs in PB or BM. Recently, however, other markers such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), estrogen receptor (ER), and immuno-checkpoint genes also have been examined to facilitate detection of CTCs with metastatic potential. Moreover, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cells (CSCs) have also received increasing attention as important CTC markers owing to their roles in the biological progression of metastasis. In addition to these markers, researchers have attempted to develop detection or capture techniques for CTCs. Notably, however, the establishment of metastasis requires cancer-host interactions. Markers from host cells, such as macrophages, mesenchymal stem cells, and bone marrow-derived cells, which constitute the premetastatic niche, may become novel biomarkers for predicting relapse or metastasis or monitoring the effects of treatment. Biological studies of CTCs are still emerging. However, recent technical innovations, such as next-generation sequencing, are being used more commonly and could help to clarify the mechanism of metastasis. Additionally, biological findings are gradually being accumulated, adding to our body of knowledge on CTCs. In this review, we will summarize recent approaches to detect or capture CTCs. Moreover, we will introduce recent studies of the clinical and biological importance of CTCs and host cells.",

The low number of CTCs in the peripheral blood and DTCs in the bone marrow and the fact that carcinoma cells are difficult to culture are major challenges. Significant advances in the in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo expansion of CTCs and DTCs from cancer patients have been achieved, which enable us now to study the functional properties of these cells. Here, we discuss published data about functional studies on CTCs and DTCs using in\u00a0vitro cultivation and in\u00a0vivo xenograft models. Functional analyses on CTCs and DTCs offer the possibility to identify the metastasis-initiating cells. Moreover, CTC-derived cell lines and xenografts might point to new therapeutic targets and can be used for drug development.",

     "abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma is one of the highest incident-rate cancers with increasing prevalence in Western societies. Despite the advent of new approved therapeutics, the 5-year overall survival rate of stage IV melanoma patients remains below 15%. Current treatments for late stage disease have shown higher efficacy when treated at a lower disease burden. Thus, blood-based biomarkers capable of detecting melanoma prior to clinically evident distant metastasis, will improve the treatment and outcomes for melanoma patients. To that end, effective treatment of melanoma necessitates identification of patients at risk for developing distant metastases. Furthermore, employing blood biomarkers that monitor cancer progression over the course of treatment is a promising solution to post-treatment drug resistance often developed in melanoma patients. Non-invasive blood biomarker assays allow for regular dynamic monitoring of disease. \u201cLiquid Biopsy\u201d of blood, which exploits circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and cell-free circulating microRNA (cmiRNA), has been shown to detect prognostic factors for relapse in AJCC stage III and stage IV melanoma patients. Moreover, molecular characterization of CTC and analysis of various forms of ctDNA present promising potential in development of individualized therapy for melanoma patients. New approaches such as massive parallel sequencing (MPS) provide a comprehensive view of the disease progression, allowing for the selection of therapeutic options for individual patients. With advancements of improving molecular assays, liquid biopsy analysis as a powerful, routine clinical assay for melanoma patients, is highly promising prospective.",

     "abstract": "5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), a neurotransmitter and vasoactive factor, has been reported to promote proliferation of serum-deprived hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells but the detailed intracellular mechanism is unknown. As Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling is highly dysregulated in a majority of HCC, this study explored the regulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling by 5-HT. The expression of various 5-HT receptors was studied by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in HCC cell lines as well as in 33 pairs of HCC tumours and corresponding adjacent non-tumour tissues. Receptors 5-HT1D (21/33, 63.6%), 5-HT2B (12/33, 36.4%) and 5-HT7 (15/33, 45.4%) were overexpressed whereas receptors 5-HT2A (17/33, 51.5%) and 5-HT5 (30/33, 90.1%) were reduced in HCC tumour tissues. In\u00a0vitro data suggests 5-HT increased total \u03b2-catenin, active \u03b2-catenin and decreased phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin protein levels in serum deprived HuH-7 and HepG2 cells compared to control cells under serum free medium without 5-HT. Activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling was evidenced by increased expression of \u03b2-catenin downstream target genes, Axin2, cyclin D1, dickoppf-1 (DKK1) and glutamine synthetase (GS) by qPCR in serum-deprived HCC cell lines treated with 5-HT. Additionally, biochemical analysis revealed 5-HT disrupted Axin1/\u03b2-catenin interaction, a critical step in \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation. Increased Wnt/\u03b2-catenin activity was attenuated by antagonist of receptor 5-HT7 (SB-258719) in HCC cell lines and patient-derived primary tumour tissues in the presence of 5-HT. SB-258719 also reduced tumour growth in\u00a0vivo. This study provides evidence of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling activation by 5-HT and may represent a potential therapeutic target for hepatocarcinogenesis.",

In the whole cohort, 208/1755 patients (11.9%) developed local recurrence of which 126 (61%) developed local recurrence within 5 years of initiation of primary therapy. Of the 20 markers tested, only pChk1 and p53 significantly associated with early local recurrence (p value\u00a0=\u00a00.015 and 0.010, respectively).

     "abstract": "Aberrant Wnt signaling frequently occurs in pancreatic cancer (PC) and contributes to disease progression/metastases. Likewise, the transmembrane-mucin MUC4 is expressed de novo in early pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs) and incrementally increases with PC progression, contributing to metastasis. To determine the mechanism of MUC4 upregulation in PC, we examined factors deregulated in early PC progression, such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. MUC4 promoter analysis revealed the presence of three putative TCF/LEF-binding sites, leading us to hypothesize that MUC4 can be regulated by \u03b2-catenin. Immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of rapid autopsy PC tissues showed a correlation between MUC4 and cytosolic/nuclear \u03b2-catenin expression. Knock down (KD) of \u03b2-catenin in CD18/HPAF and T3M4 cell lines resulted in decreased MUC4 transcript and protein. Three MUC4 promoter luciferase constructs, p3778, p3000, and p2700, were generated. The construct p3778, encompassing the entire MUC4 promoter, elicited increased luciferase activity in the presence of stabilized \u03b2-catenin. Mutation of the TCF/LEF site closest to the transcription start site (i.e., \u22122629/\u22122612) and furthest from the start site (i.e., \u22123425/\u22123408) reduced MUC4 promoter luciferase activity. Transfection with dominant negative TCF4 decreased MUC4 transcript and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed enrichment of \u03b2-catenin on \u22122629/\u22122612 and \u22123425/\u22123408 of the MUC4 promoter in CD18/HPAF. Functionally, CD18/HPAF and T3M4 \u03b2-catenin KD cells showed decreased migration and decreased Vimentin, N-cadherin, and pERK1/2 expression. Tumorigenicity studies in athymic nude mice showed CD18/HPAF \u03b2-catenin KD cells significantly reduced primary tumor sizes and metastases compared to scrambled control cells. We show for the first time that \u03b2-catenin directly governs MUC4 in PC.",

Although MYCN amplification is strongly correlated with NB of poor outcome, the MYCN status cannot alone predict all cases of poor survival in NB. Indeed NB without MYCN amplification (about 70\u201380% of NB) are not always favorable. WT1 was initially identified as a tumor suppressor gene involved in the development of a pediatric renal tumor (Wilms' tumor). Here, we describe an inverse correlation between WT1 expression and MYCN amplification and expression.

     "abstract": "Cancer cells within a tumor are functionally heterogeneous and specific subpopulations, defined as cancer initiating cells (CICs), are endowed with higher tumor forming potential. The CIC state, however, is not hierarchically stable and conversion of non-CICs to CICs under microenvironment signals might represent a determinant of tumor aggressiveness. How plasticity is regulated at the cellular level is however poorly understood. To identify determinants of plasticity in lung cancer we exposed eight different cell lines to TGF\u03b21 to induce EMT and stimulate modulation of CD133+\u00a0CICs. We show that response to TGF\u03b21 treatment is heterogeneous with some cells readily switching to stem cell state (1.5\u20132 fold CICs increase) and others being unresponsive to stimulation. This response is unrelated to original CICs content or extent of EMT engagement but is tightly dependent on balance between epithelial and mesenchymal features as measured by the ratio of expression of CDH1 (E-cadherin) to SNAI2. Epigenetic modulation of this balance can restore sensitivity of unresponsive models to microenvironmental stimuli, including those elicited by cancer-associated fibroblasts both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. In particular, tumors with increased prevalence of cells with features of partial EMT (hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype) are endowed with the highest plasticity and specific patterns of expression of SNAI2 and CDH1 markers identify a subset of tumors with worse prognosis. In conclusion, here we describe a connection between a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal phenotype and conversion to stem-cell state in response to external stimuli. These findings have implications for current endeavors to identify tumors with increased plasticity.",

Robo4 (roundabout homolog 4) signaling has been shown to protect endothelial integrity during sepsis shock and arthritis, and inhibit Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling during pathological angiogenesis of retinopathy, which indicates that Robo4 might be a potential target for angiogenesis in breast cancer. In this study, we used immune competent Robo4 knockout mouse model to show that endothelial Robo4 is important for suppressing breast cancer growth and metastasis. And this effect does not involve the function of Robo4 on hematopoietic stem cells. Robo4 inhibits breast cancer growth and metastasis by regulating tumor angiogenesis, endothelial leakage and tight junction protein zonula occludens protein-1 (ZO-1) downregulation. Treatment with SecinH3, a small molecule drug which deactivates ARF6 downstream of Robo4, can enhance Robo4 signaling and thus inhibit breast cancer growth and metastasis. SecinH3 mediated its effect by reducing tumor angiogenesis rather than directly affecting cancer cell proliferation. In conclusion, endothelial Robo4 signaling is important for suppressing breast cancer growth and metastasis, and it can be targeted (enhanced) by administrating a small molecular drug.",

     "abstract": "Circulating miRNA stability suggests potential utility of miRNA based biomarkers to monitor tumor burden and/or progression, particularly in cancer types where serial biopsy is impractical. Assessment of miRNA specificity and sensitivity is challenging within the clinical setting. To address this, circulating miRNAs were examined in mice bearing human SCLC tumor xenografts and SCLC patient derived circulating tumor cell explant models (CDX). We identified 49 miRNAs using human TaqMan Low Density Arrays readily detectable in 10\u00a0\u03bcl tail vein plasma from mice carrying H526 SCLC xenografts that were low or undetectable in non-tumor bearing controls. Circulating miR-95 measured serially in mice bearing CDX was detected with tumor volumes as low as 10\u00a0mm3 and faithfully reported subsequent tumor growth.Having established assay sensitivity in mouse models, we identified 26 miRNAs that were elevated in a stage dependent manner in a pilot study of plasma from SCLC patients (n\u00a0=\u00a016) compared to healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a011) that were also elevated in the mouse models.

Using a multiplex qPCR assay, elevated levels of miRNAs across the panel were also observed in a further 66 patients with non-small cell lung, colorectal or pancreatic cancers. The utility of this circulating miRNA panel as an early warning of tumor progression across several tumor types merits further evaluation in larger studies.",

Dysregulation of several TDRDs have been observed in various types of cancer. However, neither the genomic landscape nor clinical significance of TDRDs in breast cancer has been explored comprehensively. Here, we performed an integrated genomic and transcriptomic analysis of 41 TDRD genes in breast cancer (TCGA and METABRIC datasets) and identified associations among recurrent copy number alterations, gene expressions, clinicopathological features, and survival of patients. Among seven TDRDs that had the highest frequency (>10%) of gene amplification, the plant homeodomain finger protein 20-like 1 (PHF20L1) was the most commonly amplified (17.62%) TDRD gene in TCGA breast cancers. Different subtypes of breast cancer had different patterns of copy number and expression for each TDRD. Notably, amplification and overexpression of PHF20L1 were more prevalent in aggressive basal-like and Luminal B subtypes and were significantly associated with shorter survival of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, knockdown of PHF20L1 inhibited cell proliferation in PHF20L1-amplified breast cancer cell lines. PHF20L1 protein contains N-terminal Tudor and C-terminal plant homeodomain domains. Detailed characterization of PHF20L1 in breast cancer revealed that the Tudor domain likely plays a critical role in promoting cancer.

     "abstract": "Periampullary adenocarcinomas can be of two histological subtypes, intestinal or pancreatobiliary. The latter is more frequent and aggressive, and characterized by a prominent desmoplastic stroma, which is tightly related to the biology of the cancer, including its poor response to chemotherapy. Whereas miRNAs are known to regulate various cellular processes and interactions between cells, their exact role in periampullary carcinoma remains to be characterized, especially with respect to the prominent stromal component of pancreatobiliary type cancers. The present study aimed at elucidating this role by miRNA expression profiling of the carcinomatous and stromal component in twenty periampullary adenocarcinomas of pancreatobiliary type. miRNA expression profiles were compared between carcinoma cells, stromal cells and normal tissue samples. A total of 43 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed between carcinoma and stroma of which 11 belong to three miRNA families (miR-17, miR-15 and miR-515). The levels of expression of miRNAs miR-17, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-223, miR-10b, miR-2964a and miR-342 were observed to be higher and miR-519e to be lower in the stromal component compared to the carcinomatous and normal components. They follow a trend where expression in stroma is highest followed by carcinoma and then normal tissue. Pathway analysis revealed that pathways regulating tumor\u2013stroma interactions such as ECM interaction remodeling, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, focal adhesion pathway, TGF-beta, MAPK signaling, axon guidance and endocytosis were differently regulated. The miRNA-mRNA mediated interactions between carcinoma and stromal cells add new knowledge regarding tumor-stroma interactions.",

Here we investigated the molecular mechanisms and potential targets of CBP involved in tumor growth and survival in lung cancer cells. Elevated expression of CBP was detected in lung cancer cells and tumor tissues compared to the normal lung cells and tissues. Knockdown of CBP by siRNA or inhibition of its HAT activity using specific chemical inhibitor effectively suppressed cell proliferation, migration and colony formation and induced apoptosis in lung cancer cells by inhibiting MAPK and activating cytochrome C/caspase-dependent signaling pathways. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence analyses revealed the co-localization and interaction between CBP and CPSF4 (cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4) proteins in lung cancer cells. Knockdown of CPSF4 inhibited hTERT transcription and cell growth induced by CBP, and vice versa, demonstrating the synergetic effect of CBP and CPSF4 in the regulation of lung cancer cell growth and survival. Moreover, we found that high expression of both CBP and CPSF4 predicted a poor prognosis in the patients with lung adenocarcinomas.

     "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is an embryonal pediatric tumor that originates from the developing sympathetic nervous system and shows a broad range of clinical behavior, ranging from fatal progression to differentiation into benign ganglioneuroma. In experimental neuroblastoma systems, retinoic acid (RA) effectively induces neuronal differentiation, and RA treatment has been therefore integrated in current therapies. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying differentiation are still poorly understood. We here investigated the role of transcription factor activating protein 2 beta (TFAP2B), a key factor in sympathetic nervous system development, in neuroblastoma pathogenesis and differentiation. Microarray analyses of primary neuroblastomas (n\u00a0=\u00a0649) demonstrated that low TFAP2B expression was significantly associated with unfavorable prognostic markers as well as adverse patient outcome. We also found that low TFAP2B expression was strongly associated with CpG methylation of the TFAP2B locus in primary neuroblastomas (n\u00a0=\u00a0105) and demethylation with 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine resulted in induction of TFAP2B expression in\u00a0vitro, suggesting that TFAP2B is silenced by genomic methylation. Tetracycline inducible re-expression of TFAP2B in IMR-32 and SH-EP neuroblastoma cells significantly impaired proliferation and cell cycle progression. In IMR-32 cells, TFAP2B induced neuronal differentiation, which was accompanied by up-regulation of the catecholamine biosynthesizing enzyme genes DBH and TH, and down-regulation of MYCN and REST, a master repressor of neuronal genes. By contrast, knockdown of TFAP2B by lentiviral transduction of shRNAs abrogated RA-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE(2)c neuroblastoma cells almost completely. Taken together, our results suggest that TFAP2B is playing a vital role in retaining RA responsiveness and mediating noradrenergic neuronal differentiation in neuroblastoma.",

Among 19 LCIS and ILC synchronous pairs, 14 (74%) had at least one identical mutation in common, including identical PIK3CA and CDH1 mutations. Paired analysis of independent foci of LCIS from 3 breasts revealed at least one common mutation in each of the 3 pairs (CDH1, PIK3CA, CBFB and PKHD1L1).LCIS and ILC have a similar repertoire of somatic mutations, with PIK3CA and CDH1 being the most frequently mutated genes. The presence of identical mutations between LCIS\u2013LCIS and LCIS\u2013ILC pairs demonstrates that LCIS is a clonal neoplastic lesion, and provides additional evidence that at least some LCIS are non-obligate precursors of ILC.",

However, in the recurrent disease resistance to tamoxifen therapy is common and a major cause of death. In recent years, in-depth proteome analyses have enabled identification of clinically useful biomarkers, particularly, when heterogeneity in complex tumor tissue was reduced using laser capture microdissection (LCM). In the current study, we performed high resolution proteomic analysis on two cohorts of ER positive breast tumors derived from patients who either manifested good or poor outcome to tamoxifen treatment upon recurrence. A total of 112 fresh frozen tumors were collected from multiple medical centers and divided into two sets: an in-house training and a multi-center test set. Epithelial tumor cells were enriched with LCM and analyzed by nano-LC Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS), which yielded >3000 and >4000 quantified proteins in the training and test sets, respectively. Raw data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifiers PXD000484 and PXD000485. Statistical analysis showed differential abundance of 99 proteins, of which a subset of 4 proteins was selected through a multivariate step-down to develop a predictor for tamoxifen treatment outcome.

     "abstract": "Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) constitute an abundant stromal component of most solid tumors. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) \u03b1 is a cell surface protease that is expressed by CAFs. We corroborate this expression profile by immunohistochemical analysis of colorectal cancer specimens. To better understand the tumor-contextual role of FAP\u03b1, we investigate how FAP\u03b1 shapes functional and proteomic features of CAFs using loss- and gain-of function cellular model systems. FAP\u03b1 activity has a strong impact on the secreted CAF proteome (\u201csecretome\u201d), including reduced levels of anti-angiogenic factors, elevated levels of transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2, and an impact on matrix processing enzymes. Functionally, FAP\u03b1 mildly induces sprout formation by human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Moreover, loss of FAP\u03b1 leads to a more epithelial cellular phenotype and this effect was rescued by exogenous application of TGF\u03b2. In collagen contraction assays, FAP\u03b1 induced a more contractile cellular phenotype. To characterize the proteolytic profile of FAP\u03b1, we investigated its specificity with proteome-derived peptide libraries and corroborated its preference for cleavage carboxy-terminal to proline residues. By \u201cterminal amine labeling of substrates\u201d (TAILS) we explored FAP\u03b1-dependent cleavage events. Although FAP\u03b1 acts predominantly as an amino-dipeptidase, putative FAP\u03b1 cleavage sites in collagens are present throughout the entire protein length. In contrast, putative FAP\u03b1 cleavage sites in non-collagenous proteins cluster at the amino-terminus. The degradomic study highlights cell-contextual proteolysis by FAP\u03b1 with distinct positional profiles.

Integration of these types of molecular data allows us to study the relationship between serum glycans and transcripts representing functional pathways, such as metabolic pathways or DNA damage response. We identified tri antennary trigalactosylated trisialylated glycans in serum as being associated with lower levels of tumour transcripts involved in focal adhesion and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. These glycan structures were also linked to poor prognosis in patients with ER negative tumours. High abundance of simple monoantennary glycan structures were associated with increased survival, particularly in the basal-like subgroup.

We investigated correspondence between growth inhibitory concentrations of paclitaxel and gemcitabine (GI50) and gene copy number, mutation, and expression first in breast cancer cell lines and then in patients. Genes encoding direct targets of these drugs, metabolizing enzymes, transporters, and those previously associated with chemoresistance to paclitaxel (n\u00a0=\u00a031 genes) or gemcitabine (n\u00a0=\u00a018) were analyzed. A multi-factorial, principal component analysis (MFA) indicated expression was the strongest indicator of sensitivity for paclitaxel, and copy number and expression were informative for gemcitabine. The factors were combined using support vector machines (SVM). Expression of 15 genes (ABCC10, BCL2, BCL2L1, BIRC5, BMF, FGF2, FN1, MAP4, MAPT, NFKB2, SLCO1B3, TLR6, TMEM243, TWIST1, and CSAG2) predicted cell line sensitivity to paclitaxel with 82% accuracy. Copy number profiles of 3 genes (ABCC10, NT5C, TYMS) together with expression of 7 genes (ABCB1, ABCC10, CMPK1, DCTD, NME1, RRM1, RRM2B), predicted gemcitabine response with 85% accuracy. Expression and copy number studies of two independent sets of patients with known responses were then analyzed with these models. These included tumor blocks from 21 patients that were treated with both paclitaxel and gemcitabine, and 319 patients on paclitaxel and anthracycline therapy. A new paclitaxel SVM was derived from an 11-gene subset since data for 4 of the original genes was unavailable. The accuracy of this SVM was similar in cell lines and tumor blocks (70\u201371%). The gemcitabine SVM exhibited 62% prediction accuracy for the tumor blocks due to the presence of samples with poor nucleic acid integrity.

Here we investigated the role of an immunomodulatory cytokine IL-33 and its receptor ST2 in mediating the growth and metastasis of EOC. Our data show that both IL-33 and ST2 were highly up-regulated in EOC tumors compared with normal ovary and ovarian benign tumors, and the expression levels were further increased in tumor tissues at the metastatic site. The expression levels of IL-33 and ST2 were positively correlated with the Ki-67 expression, and negatively correlated with the patient survival time. Using EOC cell lines, we observed that cells knocked down of IL-33 gene by siRNA had reduced migratory and invasive potential, while full length human IL-33 (fl-hIL-33) promoted the invasive, migratory and proliferative capacity of EOC cells and this process could be inhibited by IL-33 decoy receptor sST2. Signaling pathway analysis suggested that IL-33 increased the phosphorylation of ERK and JNK which was blocked by sST2. Fl-hIL-33-induced increases in EOC cell migration, invasive potential and proliferation were specifically abrogated by treatment with the ERK inhibitor U0126 while JNK inhibitor SP600125 only disrupted IL-33-induced enhancement of cell viability. Taken together, our data suggest that IL-33/ST2 axis closely associates with poor prognosis of EOC patients, and it promotes ovarian cancer growth and metastasis through regulating ERK and JNK signaling pathways.

We sorted the actively dividing versus non-dividing cells from cultured glioma cells, and parental and clonally derived orthotopic tumors, and analyzed them for a number of transcripts. While there was no significant difference in the transcriptional profiles between the two cellular subsets in cultured glioma cells, we demonstrate \u223c2\u20136 fold increase in transcripts of cancer and neuronal stem cell and tumor cell migration/invasion markers, and \u223c2-fold decrease in transcripts of markers of hypoxia and their target genes, in the dividing tumor cells of the orthotopic glioma when compared to their non-proliferative counterparts. This suggests the influence of the brain microenvironment in transcriptional regulation and, thereby, the physiology of glioma cells in\u00a0vivo. When clonal glioma cells were derived from a parental glioma and the resultant orthotopic tumors were compared, their transcriptional profiles were closely correlated to tumor aggression and consequently, survival of the experimental animals. This study demonstrates the resolution of intratumor heterogeneity for profiling studies based on cell proliferation, a defining feature of cancers, with implications for treatment design.",

Quantitative measurement of HER2 may more accurately identify breast cancer (BC) patients who will respond to anti-HER2 treatments.Using selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (SRM-MS), we quantified HER2 protein levels in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples that had been classified as HER2 0, 1+, 2+ or 3+ by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was conducted to obtain optimal HER2 protein expression thresholds predictive of HER2 status (by standard IHC or in situ hybridization [ISH]) and of survival benefit after anti-HER2 therapy.Absolute HER2 amol/\u03bcg levels were significantly correlated with both HER2 IHC and amplification status by ISH (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). A HER2 threshold of 740\u00a0amol/\u03bcg showed an agreement rate of 94% with IHC and ISH standard HER2 testing (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Discordant cases (SRM-MS-negative/ISH-positive) showed a characteristic amplification pattern known as double minutes. HER2 levels >2200\u00a0amol/\u03bcg were significantly associated with longer disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in an adjuvant setting and with longer OS in a metastatic setting.Quantitative HER2 measurement by SRM-MS is superior to IHC and ISH in predicting outcome after treatment with anti-HER2 therapy.",

A remodeling of adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP)-induced Ca2+ signaling via purinergic receptors is associated with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced EMT in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. Here, we assessed ATP-mediated Ca2+ signaling in a model of hypoxia-induced EMT in MDA-MB-468 cells. Like EGF, hypoxia treatment (1% O2) was also associated with a significant reduction in the sensitivity of MDA-MB-468 cells to ATP (EC50 of 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM for normoxic cells versus EC50 of 5.8\u00a0\u03bcM for hypoxic cells). Assessment of mRNA levels of a panel of P2X and P2Y purinergic receptors following hypoxia revealed a change in levels of a suite of purinergic receptors. P2X4, P2X5, P2X7, P2Y1 and P2Y11 mRNAs decreased with hypoxia, whereas P2Y6 mRNA increased. Up-regulation of P2Y6 was a common feature of both growth factor- and hypoxia-induced models of EMT. P2Y6 levels were also significantly increased in basal-like breast tumors compared to other subtypes and breast cancer patients with higher P2Y6 levels showed reduced overall survival rates. P2Y6 siRNA-mediated silencing and the P2Y6 pharmacological inhibitor MRS2578 reduced hypoxia-induced vimentin protein expression in MDA-MB-468 cells. P2Y6 inhibition also reduced the migration of mesenchymal-like MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The up-regulation of P2Y6 appears to be a common feature of the mesenchymal phenotype of breast cancer cells and inhibition of this receptor may represent a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer metastasis.",

Defects in HR repair have been linked to the initiation and development of a wide variety of human malignancies, and exploited in chemical, radiological and targeted therapies. In this study, we performed a personalised pathway analysis independently for four large sporadic breast cancer cohorts to investigate the status of HR pathway dysregulation in individual sporadic breast tumours, its association with HR repair deficiency and its impact on tumour characteristics. Specifically, we first manually curated a list of HR genes according to our recent review on this pathway (Liu et\u00a0al., 2014), and then applied a personalised pathway analysis method named Pathifier (Drier et\u00a0al., 2013) on the expression levels of the curated genes to obtain an HR score quantifying HR pathway dysregulation in individual tumours. Based on the score, we observed a great diversity in HR dysregulation between and within gene expression-based breast cancer subtypes, and by using two published HR-defect signatures, we found HR pathway dysregulation reflects HR repair deficiency. Furthermore, we identified a novel association between HR pathway dysregulation and chromosomal instability (CIN) in sporadic breast cancer. Although CIN has long been considered as a hallmark of most solid tumours, with recent extensive studies highlighting its importance in tumour evolution and drug resistance, the molecular basis of CIN in sporadic cancers remains poorly understood. Our results imply that HR pathway dysregulation might contribute to CIN in sporadic breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Several mechanisms can be responsible for control of hematological tumors by allo-reactive T cells. Following allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) donor T cells recognizing genetic disparities presented on recipient cells and not on donor cells are main effectors of tumor control, but also of the detrimental graft versus host disease (GVHD). Since after transplantation normal hematopoiesis is of donor origin, any T cell response directed against polymorphic antigens expressed on hematopoietic recipient cells but not on donor cells will result in an anti-tumor response not affecting normal hematopoiesis. After fully HLA-matched alloSCT, T cells recognizing polymorphic peptides derived from proteins encoded by genes selectively expressed in hematopoietic lineages may result in anti-tumor responses without GVHD. Due to the high susceptibility of hematopoietic cells for T cell recognition, a low amplitude of the overall T cell response may also be in favor of the anti-tumor reactivity in hematological malignancies. A mismatch between donor and patient for specific HLA-alleles can also be exploited to induce a selective T cell response against patient (malignant) hematopoietic cells. If restricting HLA class II molecules are selectively expressed on hematopoietic cells under non-inflammatory circumstances, allo HLA class-II responses may control the tumor with limited risk of GVHD. Alternatively, T cells recognizing hematopoiesis-restricted antigens presented in the context of mismatched HLA alleles may be used to treat patients with hematological cancers. This review discusses various ways to manipulate the allo-immune response aiming to exploit the powerful ability of allo-reactive T-cells to control the malignancies without causing severe damage to non-hematopoietic tissues.",

     "abstract": "As epithelial tumors grow from single cells to a malignant mass of invasive tissue, they must exploit the innate inflammatory response, while evading the adaptive immune system. Prognosis of solid tumors has historically focused on macroscopic features such as size, grade, and mitotic index. It is now clear that prognosis assessment must also consider the stromal and immune cells that surround and infiltrate the tumor. Tumors promote growth, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling by subverting the normal functions of macrophages and other cells of the innate immune system that inhabit their microenvironment. Simultaneously, tumor cells escape from and inactivate the adaptive immune system by exploiting the mechanisms preventing damaging auto-immune responses in cytotoxic T cells. The presence of CD8+ T cells within epithelial tumors is now a well-supported marker of better prognosis in many tumor types. However, this benefit is counterbalanced by immune regulatory cell populations that promote tumor escape from immune surveillance and metastasis. Therapeutic approaches that kill tumor cells selectively by re-activating immune checkpoints are becoming an established therapeutic option, but it is not yet clear how to identify which patients will benefit from this treatment modality. Evidence is accumulating that identifying the presence of T cell-activating neoantigens, produced by mutated proteins in tumors, will play an important role in checkpoint inhibitor prognosis. This review provides an overview of the evidence that lymphocytic infiltration of tumors has prognostic value in many epithelial tumor types and is linked to the success of chemical and immune checkpoint therapeutic strategies.",

DNA was extracted and 2\u00d7101\u00a0bp paired-end sequence reads were generated on cancer-related genes utilizing Illumina HiSeq and MiSeq platforms.Testing was unsuccessful in 343 (22.5%) specimens. The failure was due to insufficient tissue (INST) in 223/343 (65%) cases, insufficient DNA (INS-DNA) in 99/343 (28.9%) cases, and failed library (FL) in 21/343 (6.1%) cases. 87/99 (88%) of the INS-DNA cases had below 10\u00a0ng DNA available for testing. Factors associated with INST and INS-DNA failures were site of biopsy (SOB) and type of biopsy (TOB) (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and clinical setting of biopsy (CSB, initial diagnosis or recurrence) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

     "abstract": "Tamoxifen is the treatment of choice in estrogen receptor alpha breast cancer patients that are eligible for adjuvant endocrine therapy. However, \u223c50% of ER\u03b1-positive tumors exhibit intrinsic or rapidly acquire resistance to endocrine treatment. Unfortunately, prediction of de novo resistance to endocrine therapy and/or assessment of relapse likelihood remain difficult. While several mechanisms regulating the acquisition and the maintenance of endocrine resistance have been reported, there are several aspects of this phenomenon that need to be further elucidated. Altered metabolic fate of tamoxifen within patients and emergence of tamoxifen-resistant clones, driven by evolution of the disease phenotype during treatment, appear as the most compelling hypotheses so far. In addition, tamoxifen was reported to induce pluripotency in breast cancer cell lines, in\u00a0vitro. In this context, we have performed a whole transcriptome analysis of an ER\u03b1-positive (T47D) and a triple-negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231), exposed to tamoxifen for a short time frame (hours), in order to identify how early pluripotency-related effects of tamoxifen may occur. Our ultimate goal was to identify whether the transcriptional actions of tamoxifen related to induction of pluripotency are mediated through specific ER-dependent or independent mechanisms. We report that even as early as 3 hours after the exposure of breast cancer cells to tamoxifen, a subset of ER\u03b1-dependent genes associated with developmental processes and pluripotency are induced and this is accompanied by specific phenotypic changes (expression of pluripotency-related proteins). Furthermore we report an association between the increased expression of pluripotency-related genes in ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer tissues samples and disease relapse after tamoxifen therapy. Finally we describe that in a small group of ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer patients, with disease relapse after surgery and tamoxifen treatment, ALDH1A1 (a marker of pluripotency in epithelial cancers which is absent in normal breast tissue) is increased in relapsing tumors, with a concurrent modification of its intra-cellular localization. Our data could be of value in the discrimination of patients susceptible to develop tamoxifen resistance and in the selection of optimized patient-tailored therapies.",

     "abstract": "An awesome number of experimental and clinical evidences indicate that constitutive activation of the Met oncogenic receptor plays a critical role in the progression of cancer toward metastasis and/or resistance to targeted therapies. While mutations are rare, the common mechanism of Met activation is overexpression, either by gene amplification (\u2018addiction\u2019) or transcriptional activation (\u2018expedience\u2019). In the first instance ligand-independent kinase activation plays a major role in sustaining the transformed phenotype. Anti-Met antibodies directed against the receptor binding site behave essentially as ligand (Hepatocyte Growth Factor, HGF) antagonists and are ineffective to counteract ligand-independent activation. The monovalent chimeric MvDN30 antibody fragment, PEGylated to extend its half-life, binds the fourth IPT domain and induces \u2018shedding\u2019 of the Met extracellular domain, dramatically reducing both the number of receptors on the surface and their phosphorylation. Downstream signaling is thus inhibited, both in the absence or in the presence of the ligand. In\u00a0vitro, MvDN30 is a strong inhibitor not only of ligand-dependent invasive growth, sustained by both paracrine and autocrine HGF, but notably, also of ligand-independent growth of \u2018Met-addicted\u2019 cells. In immunocompromised mice, lacking expression of Hepatocyte Growth Factor cross-reacting with the human receptor \u2013 thus providing, by definition, a model of \u2018ligand-independent\u2019 Met activation \u2013 PEGylated MvDN30 impairs growth of Met \u2018addicted\u2019 human gastric carcinoma cells. In a Met-amplified patient-derived colo-rectal tumor (xenopatient) MvDN30-PEG overcomes the resistance to EGFR targeted therapy (Cetuximab). The PEGylated MvDN30 is thus a strong candidate for targeting tumors sustained by ligand-independent Met oncogenic activation.",

We performed western blot, flow cytometry and immunocytochemical analyses to demonstrate the specificity of the PDL1 antibody used in our study and established immunoscores for PDL1 expression on single tumor cells. We then selected sixteen patients with circulating tumor cells (CTCs) using the CellSearch\u00ae system and found PD-L1(+) CTCs in 11 patients (68.8%). The fraction of PD-L1(+) CTCs varied from 0.2 to 100% in individual patients. This is the first report demonstrating the expression of PD-L1 on CTCs. The established CTC/PD-L1 assay can be used for liquid biopsy in future clinical trials for stratification and monitoring of cancer patients undergoing immune checkpoint blockade.",

Consequently, the pan-SFK inhibitor dasatinib has emerged as a therapeutic strategy, despite physiologic limitations to its effectiveness in the brain. We investigated the importance of individual SFKs (Src, Fyn, Yes, and Lyn) to glioma tumor biology by knocking down individual SFK expression both in culture (LN229, SF767, GBM8) and orthotopic xenograft (GBM8) contexts. We evaluated the effects of these knockdowns on tumor cell proliferation, migration, and motility-related signaling in culture, as well as overall survival in the orthotopic xenograft model. The four SFKs differed significantly in their importance to these properties. In culture, Src, Fyn, and Yes knockdown generally reduced growth and migration and altered motility-related phosphorylation patterns while Lyn knockdown did so to a lesser extent. However the details of these effects varied significantly depending on the cell line: in no case were conclusions about the role of a particular SFK applicable to all of the measures or all of the cell types examined. In the orthotopic xenograft model, mice implanted with non-target or Src or Fyn knockdown cells showed no differences in survival. In contrast, mice implanted with Yes knockdown cells had longer survival, associated with reduced tumor cell proliferation. Those implanted with Lyn knockdown cells had shorter survival, associated with higher overall tumor burden. Together, our results suggest that Yes signaling directly affects tumor cell biology in a pro-tumorigenic manner, while Lyn signaling affects interactions between tumor cells and the microenvironment in an anti-tumor manner. In the context of therapeutic targeting of SFKs, these results suggest that pan-SFK inhibitors may not produce the intended therapeutic benefit when Lyn is present.",

     "abstract": "Promoter DNA hypermethylation is an important biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), supporting the potential utility of demethylating agents in this disease. Guadecitabine (SGI-110) is a second-generation hypomethylating agent formulated as a dinucleotide of decitabine and deoxyguanosine that yields longer half-life and more extended decitabine exposure than decitabine IV infusion. Here we performed preclinical evaluation of SGI-110 in HCC models to guide the design of a phase I/II clinical trial. HCC cell lines and xenograft models were used to determine the antitumor activity of SGI-110 as a single agent and in combination with oxaliplatin. Pretreatment with low doses of SGI-110 significantly synergized with oxaliplatin yielding enhanced cytotoxicity. The combination of SGI-110 and oxaliplatin was well tolerated and significantly delayed tumor growth in mice compared to oxaliplatin alone. Bromouridine-labeled RNA sequencing (Bru-seq) was employed to elucidate the effects of SGI-110 and/or oxaliplatin on genome-wide transcription. SGI-110 and the combination treatment inhibited the expression of genes involved in WNT/EGF/IGF signaling. DNMT1 and survivin were identified as novel PD markers to monitor the efficacy of the combination treatment. In conclusion, SGI-110 priming sensitizes HCC cells to oxaliplatin by inhibiting distinct signaling pathways. We expect that this combination treatment will show low toxicity and high efficacy in patients. Our study supports the use of the combination of low doses of SGI-110 and oxaliplatin in HCC patients.",

Interest in tumor necrosis factor\u2013related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), a potent inducer of cell death, has increased following the observation that TRAIL can selectively kill a wide variety of human cancer cells without killing normal cells both in\u00a0vitro and in xenograft models. However, results from clinical trials of TRAIL-based therapy are disappointingly modest at best and many have demonstrated a lack of therapeutic benefit. Current research has focused on selecting a subpopulation of cancer patients who may benefit from TRAIL-based therapy and identifying best drugs to work with TRAIL. In the current study, we found that NSCLC cells with a KRAS mutation were highly sensitive to treatment with TRAIL and 5-fluorouracil (5FU). Compared with other chemotherapeutic agents, 5FU displayed the highest synergy with TRAIL in inducing apoptosis in mutant KRAS NSCLC cells. We also found that, on a mechanistic level, 5FU preferentially repressed survivin expression and induced expression of TRAIL death receptor 5 to sensitize NSCLC cells to TRAIL. The combination of low-dose 5FU and TRAIL strongly inhibited xenograft tumor growth in mice. Our results suggest that the combination of TRAIL and 5FU may be beneficial for patients with mutant KRAS NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a key role in skin inflammation, wound healing, and carcinogenesis. Less is known about the functions of the structurally related receptor ERBB3 (HER3) in the skin. We assessed the requirement of ERBB3 for skin homeostasis, wound healing, and tumorigenesis by crossing mice carrying a conditional Erbb3 allele with animals expressing cre under the control of the keratin 5 promoter. Erbb3del mice, lacking ERBB3 specifically in keratinocytes, showed no obvious abnormalities. The EGFR was upregulated in Erbb3del skin, possibly compensating the loss of ERBB3. Nonetheless, healing of full-thickness excisional wounds was negatively affected by ERBB3 deficiency. To analyze the function of ERBB3 during tumorigenesis, we employed the established DMBA/TPA multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Erbb3del mice remained free of papillomas for a longer time and had significantly reduced tumor burden compared to control littermates. Tumor cell proliferation was considerably reduced in Erbb3del mice, and loss of ERBB3 also impaired keratinocyte proliferation after a single application of TPA. In human skin tumor samples, upregulated ERBB3 expression was observed in squamous cell carcinoma, condyloma, and malignant melanoma. Thus, we conclude that ERBB3, while dispensable for the development and the homeostasis of the epidermis and its appendages, is required for proper wound healing and for the progression of skin tumors during multi-stage chemical carcinogenesis in mice. ERBB3 may also be important for human skin cancer progression. The latter effects most probably reflect a key role for ERBB3 in increasing cell proliferation after stimuli as wounding or carcinogenesis.",

Similar link between Met activity and PEA3 factors expression was found in lung cancer cells displaying resistance to EGFR targeted therapy involving met gene amplification.

Analytical validity was defined as any SNP with <5% discordance between FFPE-T and blood and <10% discordance plus no-calls.Matched samples from 114 patients were genotyped for 247 SNPs. No-call rate in FFPE-T was greater than FFPE-LN and blood (4.3% vs. 3.0% vs. 0.5%, p < 0.001).

Level of CARF expression was shown to determine fate of cells. Whereas its knockdown caused apoptosis, its over- and super-expressions caused senescence and increase in malignant properties of cancer cells, respectively, and were closely linked to increase and decrease in p53 activity. Using p53-compromised cancer cells, we demonstrate that CARF induces growth arrest when wild type p53 is present and in p53-absence, it promotes carcinogenesis. Biochemical analyses on CARF-induced molecular signaling revealed that in p53-null cells, it caused transcriptional repression of p21WAF1 leading to increase in CDK4, CDK6, pRb and E2F1 resulting in continued cell cycle progression. Furthermore, it instigated increase in migration and invasion of cancer cells that was marked by upregulation of MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, uPA, several interleukins and VEGF expression. Consistent with these findings, we found that human clinical samples of epithelial and glial cancers (frequently marked by loss of p53 function) possessed high level of CARF expression showing a relationship with cancer aggressiveness. The data demonstrated that CARF could be considered as a diagnostic marker and a therapeutic target in p53-compromised malignancies.",

Tumors grown within preirradiated beds were highly enriched in transcripts encoding collagens and other proteins building or modifying the extracellular matrix, such as laminin-332, tenascins, lysyl oxidases and matrix metalloproteinases. Type I collagen, known to directly contribute to tissue stiffening, and the pro-metastatic megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (Mkl1) target gene tenascin-C were further investigated. Mammary tissue preirradiation induced Mkl1 nuclear translocation in the tumor cells in\u00a0vivo, indicating activation of Mkl1 signaling.

However, application of dynamic strain or matrix stiffness to 4T1 cells converted the predominant SRF/Mkl1 action into SAP domain-dependent Mkl1 signaling independent of SRF, accompanied by a switch to SAP-dependent tumor cell migration. 4T1 tumors overexpressing intact Mkl1 became more metastatic within preirradiated beds, while tumors expressing Mkl1 lacking the SAP domain exhibited impaired growth and metastatic spread, and decreased Mkl1 target gene expression. Thus, we identified SAP-dependent Mkl1 signaling as a previously unrecognized mediator of aggressive progression of mammary tumors locally relapsing after radiotherapy, and provide a novel signaling pathway for therapeutic intervention.",

BRCA1 is required for homologous recombination-mediated DNA repair and deficiency results in genomic instability. BRCA1-mutated tumors have a specific pattern of genomic copy number aberrations that can be used to classify tumors as BRCA1-like or non-BRCA1-like. BRCA1 mutation, promoter methylation, BRCA1-like status and genome-wide expression data was determined for 112 TN breast cancer samples with long-term follow-up. Mutation status for 21 known DNA repair genes and PIK3CA was assessed. Gene expression and mutation frequency in BRCA1-like and non-BRCA1-like tumors were compared. Multivariate survival analysis was performed using the Cox proportional hazards model. BRCA1 germline mutation was identified in 10% of patients and 15% of tumors were BRCA1 promoter methylated. Fifty-five percent of tumors classified as BRCA1-like. The functions of genes significantly up-regulated in BRCA1-like tumors included cell cycle and DNA recombination and repair. TP53 was found to be frequently mutated in BRCA1-like (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while PIK3CA was frequently mutated in non-BRCA1-like tumors (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). A significant association with worse prognosis was evident for patients with BRCA1-like tumors (adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a03.32, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.30\u20138.48, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). TN tumors can be further divided into two major subgroups, BRCA1-like and non-BRCA1-like with different mutation and expression patterns and prognoses. Based on these molecular patterns, subgroups may be more sensitive to specific targeted agents such as PI3K or PARP inhibitors.",

Chemotherapy with or without surgery provides moderate improvements in overall survival and quality of life; nevertheless the 5-year survival remains below 30%. Oncolytic vaccinia virus (VV) shows strong anti-tumour activity in models of CRC, however transient delays in disease progression are insufficient to lead to long-term survival. Here we examined the efficacy of VV with oxaliplatin or SN-38 (active metabolite of irinotecan) in CRC cell lines in vitro and VV with irinotecan in an orthotopic model of metastatic CRC. Synergistic improvements in in vitro cell killing were observed in multiple cell lines. Combination therapy was well tolerated in tumour-bearing mice and the median survival was significantly increased relative to monotherapy despite a drug-dependent decrease in the mean tumour titer. Increased apoptosis following in vitro and in vivo combination therapy was observed. In vitro cell cycle analysis showed increases in S-phase cells following infection occurred in both infected and uninfected cell populations. This corresponded to a 4-fold greater increase in apoptosis in the uninfected compared to infected cells following combination therapy. Combination treatment strategies are among the best options for patients with advanced cancers. VV is currently under clinical investigation in patients with CRC and the data presented here suggest that its combination with irinotecan may provide benefit to a subset of CRC patients. Further, investigation of this combination is necessary to determine the tumour characteristics responsible for mediating synergy.",

     "abstract": "Chemoresistance is the main obstacle to cancer cure. Contrasting studies focusing on single gene mutations, we hypothesize chemoresistance to be due to inactivation of key pathways affecting cellular mechanisms such as apoptosis, senescence, or DNA repair. In support of this hypothesis, we have previously shown inactivation of either TP53 or its key activators CHK2 and ATM to predict resistance to DNA damaging drugs in breast cancer better than TP53 mutations alone. Further, we hypothesized that redundant pathway(s) may compensate for loss of p53-pathway signaling and that these are inactivated as well in resistant tumour cells. Here, we assessed genetic alterations of the retinoblastoma gene (RB1) and its key regulators: Cyclin D and E as well as their inhibitors p16 and p27. In an exploratory cohort of 69 patients selected from two prospective studies treated with either doxorubicin monotherapy or 5-FU and mitomycin for locally advanced breast cancers, we found defects in the pRB-pathway to be associated with therapy resistance (p-values ranging from 0.001 to 0.094, depending on the cut-off value applied to p27 expression levels). Although statistically weaker, we observed confirmatory associations in a validation cohort from another prospective study (n\u00a0=\u00a0107 patients treated with neoadjuvant epirubicin monotherapy; p-values ranging from 7.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124 to 0.001 in the combined data sets). Importantly, inactivation of the p53-and the pRB-pathways in concert predicted resistance to therapy more strongly than each of the two pathways assessed individually (exploratory cohort: p-values ranging from 3.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 to 7.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 depending on cut-off values applied to ATM and p27 mRNA expression levels).

The aim of this study was to assess genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in MBC and compare them with the previously identified transcriptional subgroups of MBC, luminal M1 and M2, as well as the intrinsic subtypes of FBC. Illumina's 450K Infinium arrays were applied to 47 MBC and 188 FBC tumors. Unsupervised clustering of the most variable CpGs among MBC tumors revealed two stable epitypes, designated ME1 and ME2. The methylation patterns differed significantly between the groups and were closely associated with the transcriptional subgroups luminal M1 and M2. Tumors in the ME1 group were more proliferative and aggressive than ME2 tumors, and showed a tendency toward inferior survival. ME1 tumors also displayed hypermethylation of PRC2 target genes and high expression of EZH2, one of the core components of PRC2. Upon combined analysis of MBC and FBC tumors, ME1 MBCs clustered among luminal B FBC tumors and ME2 MBCs clustered within the predominantly luminal A FBC cluster. The majority of the MBC tumors remained grouped together within the clusters rather than being interspersed among the FBC tumors. Differences in the genomic location of methylated CpGs, as well as in the regulation of central canonical pathways may explain the separation between MBC and FBC tumors in the respective clusters. These findings further suggest that MBC is not readily defined using conventional criteria applied to FBC.",

     "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the breast cancer subgroup with the most aggressive clinical behavior. Alternatives to conventional chemotherapy are required to improve the survival of TNBC patients. Gene-expression analyses for different breast cancer subtypes revealed significant overexpression of the Timeless-interacting protein (TIPIN), which is involved in the stability of DNA replication forks, in the highly proliferative associated TNBC samples. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed higher expression of TIPIN in the most proliferative and aggressive breast cancer subtypes including TNBC, and no TIPIN expression in healthy breast tissues. The depletion of TIPIN by RNA interference impairs the proliferation of both human breast cancer and non-tumorigenic cell lines. However, this effect may be specifically associated with apoptosis in breast cancer cells. TIPIN silencing results in higher levels of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), indicative of replicative stress (RS), in TNBC compared to non-tumorigenic cells. Upon TIPIN depletion, the speed of DNA replication fork was significantly decreased in all BC cells. However, TIPIN-depleted TNBC cells are unable to fire additional replication origins in response to RS and therefore undergo apoptosis. TIPIN knockdown in TNBC cells decreases tumorigenicity in\u00a0vitro and delays tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. Our findings suggest that TIPIN is important for the maintenance of DNA replication and represents a potential treatment target for the worst prognosis associated breast cancers, such as TNBC.",

In this study, we characterized a novel CCR9-mediated pathway that promotes pancreatic cancer cell invasion and drug resistance, indicating that CCR9 may play a critical role in cancer progression through activation of \u03b2-catenin. We noted that the CCL25/CCR9 axis in pancreatic cancer cells induced the activation of \u03b2-catenin, which enhanced cell proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance. CCR9-mediated activation of \u03b2-catenin and the resulting downstream effects were effectively inhibited by blockade of the PI3K/AKT pathway, but not by antagonism of Wnt. Importantly, we discovered that CCR9/CCL25 increased the lethal dose of gemcitabine, suggesting decreased efficacy of anti-cancer drugs with CCR9 signaling. Through in silico computational modeling, we identified candidate CCR9 antagonists and tested their effects on CCR9/\u03b2-catenin regulation of cell signaling and drug sensitivity. When combined with gemcitabine, it resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity. Our results show that CCR9/\u03b2-catenin signaling enhances pancreatic cancer invasiveness and chemoresistance, and may be a highly novel therapeutic target.",

     "abstract": "Cell migration and invasion are highly regulated processes involved in both physiological and pathological conditions. Here we show that autophagy modulation regulates the migration and invasion capabilities of glioblastoma (GBM) cells. We observed that during autophagy occurrence, obtained by nutrient deprivation or by pharmacological inhibition of the mTOR complexes, GBM migration and chemokine-mediated invasion were both impaired. We also observed that SNAIL and SLUG, two master regulators of the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT process), were down-regulated upon autophagy stimulation and, as a consequence, we found a transcriptional and translational up-regulation of N- and R-cadherins. Conversely, in BECLIN 1-silenced GBM cells, an increased migration capability and an up-regulation of SNAIL and SLUG was observed, with a resulting decrease in N- and R-cadherin mRNAs. ATG5 and ATG7 down-regulation also resulted in an increased migration and invasion of GBM cells combined to an up-regulation of the two EMT regulators. Finally, experiments performed in primary GBM cells from patients largely confirmed the results obtained in established cell cultures.Overall, our results indicate that autophagy modulation triggers a molecular switch from a mesenchymal phenotype to an epithelial-like one in GBM cellular models. Since the aggressiveness and lethality of GBM is defined by local invasion and resistance to chemotherapy, we believe that our evidence provides a further rationale for including autophagy/mTOR-based targets in the current therapeutical regimen of GBM patients.",

We analysed expression of Phgdh in normal and TNBC mammary tissue samples by 2D gel-based proteomics and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and show here that high-level expression of Phgdh in mammary epithelial cells is primarily associated with cell lineage, as we found that Phgdh expression was predominant in CK5-positive cells, normal as well as malignant, thus identifying an association of this protein with the basal phenotype. Quantitative IHC analysis of Phgdh expression in normal breast tissue showed high-level expression of Phgdh in normal CK5-positive mammary epithelial cells, indicating that expression of this protein was not associated with malignancy, but rather with cell lineage. However, proteomic profiling of Phgdh showed it to be expressed in two major protein forms, and that the ratio of expression between these variants was associated with malignancy. Overexpression of Phgdh in CK5-positive cell lineages, and differential protein isoform expression, was additionally found in other tissues and cancer types, suggesting that overexpression of Phgdh is generally associated with CK5 cells, and that oncogenic function may be determined by isoform expression.",

In this work, we have found that BRCA1 is involved in regulating TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway. The loss of endogenous BRCA1 greatly attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced growth inhibition and cell cycle G1 arrest. BRCA1 greatly maintains stability of Smad4 protein, and the loss of BRCA1 results in Smad4 down-regulation, which is likely related to its downstream gene Gadd45a. Gadd45a is able to interact with \u03b2-Trcp1, a-F-box protein of SCF E3 ligase, and consequently suppresses the ubiquitin-degradation of Smad4 by SCF\u03b2-trcp1, as reflected by the observations that the induction of Gadd45a substantially stabilizes Smad4 protein. In addition, exogenous expression of Gadd45a can largely rescue the protein level of Smad4 in BRCA1 deficient cells. These results further demonstrate that BRCA1 may act as an important negative regulator in cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis through regulating the stability of Smad4, and define a novel link that connects BRCA1 to TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway.",

There is currently minimal understanding of pRCC1 pathogenesis, and treatment decisions are mostly empirical. The aim of this study was to identify biological pathways that are involved in pRCC1 pathogenesis using an integrated genomic approach. By microarray analysis, we identified a number of significantly dysregulated genes and microRNAs (miRNAs) that were unique to pRCC1. Integrated bioinformatics analyses showed enrichment of the focal adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) pathways. We experimentally validated that many members of these pathways are dysregulated in pRCC1. We identified and experimentally validated the downregulation of miR-199a-3p in pRCC1. Using cell line models, we showed that miR-199a-3p plays an important role in pRCC1 pathogenesis. Gain of function experiments showed that miR-199a-3p overexpression significantly decreased cell proliferation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). We also provide evidence that miR-199a-3p regulates the expression of genes linked to the focal adhesion and ECM pathways, such as caveolin 2 (CAV2), integrin beta 8 (ITGB8), MET proto-oncogene and mammalian target of rapamycin (MTOR). Using a luciferase reporter assay, we further provide evidence that miR-199a-3p overexpression decreases the expression of MET and MTOR. Using an integrated gene/miRNA approach, we provide evidence linking miRNAs to the focal adhesion and ECM pathways in pRCC1 pathogenesis. This novel information can contribute to the development of effective targeted therapies for pRCC1, for which there is none currently available in the clinic.",

Both resistant variants display a strong epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, with marked decreases in expression of miR-200c and miR-141 in OVCAR-3/TP, and down-regulation of all five members of the miR-200 family in MES-OV/TP. Lentiviral transfection of inhibitors of miR-200c or miR-141 in parental OVCAR-3 triggered EMT and rendered the cells resistant to paclitaxel and carboplatin. Conversely, the infection of OVCAR-3/TP cells with retroviral particles carrying the miR-200ab429 and 200c141 clusters triggered a partial mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET). This partial MET was not sufficient to re-sensitize OVCAR-3/TP cells to paclitaxel.

Transfecting the OVCAR-3/TP GFP cells with specific miRNA mimics confirmed these data. MiR-200c and miR-141 mimics conferred resistance to carboplatin in MES-OV/TP cells, similar to OVCAR-3/TP, but sensitized MES-OV to paclitaxel. Several genes involved in balancing oxidative stress were altered in OVCAR-3/TP 200c141 cells compared to controls.

Prognostic utility of PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and PTEN mutations, as well as PTEN protein loss by immunohistochemistry, was explored in the context of patient body mass index. Reverse-phase protein arrays were utilized to assess protein expression based on PTEN status. Among 187 endometrioid endometrial cancers, there were no statistically significant associations between PFS and PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PTEN mutation or loss. When stratified by body mass index, PTEN loss was associated with improved progression free survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.006) in obese (body mass index\u00a0\u2265\u00a030) patients. PTEN loss resulted in distinct protein changes: Canonical PI3K pathway activation was observed only in the non-obese population while decreased expression of \u03b2-CATENIN and phosphorylated FOXO3A was observed in obese patients. These data suggest the impact of PTEN loss on tumor biology and clinical outcomes must be interpreted in the context of body mass index, and provide a potential explanation for discrepant reports on the effect of PTEN status and obesity on prognosis in endometrial cancer. This reveals a clinically important interaction between metabolic state and tumor genetics that may unveil the biologic underpinning of obesity-related cancers and impact ongoing clinical trials with PI3K pathway inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "Recurrent gain on chromosome 3q26 encompassing the gene locus for the transcription factor SOX2 is a frequent event in human squamous cell carcinoma, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Numerous studies demonstrated that SOX2 expression and function is related to distinct aspects of tumor cell pathophysiology. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not well understood, and the correlation between SOX2 expression and clinical outcome revealed conflicting data. Transcriptional profiling after silencing of SOX2 expression in a HNSCC cell line identified a set of up-regulated genes related to cell motility (e.g. VIM, FN1, CDH2). The inverse regulation of SOX2 and aforementioned genes was validated in 18 independent HNSCC cell lines from different anatomical sites. The inhibition of cell migration and invasion by SOX2 was confirmed by constant or conditional gene silencing and accelerated motility of HNSCC cells after SOX2 silencing was partially reverted by down-regulation of vimentin. In a retrospective study, SOX2 expression was determined by immunohistochemical staining on tissue microarrays containing primary tumor specimens of two independent HNSCC patient cohorts. Low SOX2 expression was found in 19.3% and 44.9% of primary tumor specimens, respectively. Univariate analysis demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between low SOX2 protein levels and reduced progression-free survival (Cohort I 51 vs. 16 months; Cohort II 33 vs. 12 months) and overall survival (Cohort I 150 vs. 37 months; Cohort II 33 vs. 16 months). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard model analysis confirmed that low SOX2 expression serves as an independent prognostic marker for HNSCC patients. We conclude that SOX2 inhibits tumor cell motility in HNSCC cells and that low SOX2 expression serves as a prognosticator to identify HNSCC patients at high risk for treatment failure.",

We aimed to identify novel anticancer agents for OSCC using quantitative high throughput assays for screening six chemical libraries consisting of 5170 small molecule inhibitors. In depth characterization resulted in identification of pyrithione zinc (PYZ) as the most effective cytotoxic agent inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis in OSCC cells in\u00a0vitro. Further, treatment with PYZ reduced colony forming, migration and invasion potential of oral cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. PYZ treatment also led to altered expression of several key components of the major signaling pathways including PI3K/AKT/mTOR and WNT/\u03b2-catenin in OSCC cells. In addition, treatment with PYZ also reduced expression of 14-3-3\u03b6, 14-3-3\u03c3, cyclin D1, c-Myc and pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), proteins identified in our earlier studies to be involved in development and progression of OSCCs. Importantly, PYZ treatment significantly reduced tumor xenograft volume in immunocompromised NOD/SCID/Crl mice without causing apparent toxicity to normal tissues. Taken together, we demonstrate in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo efficacy of PYZ in OSCC.

However, the mechanisms behind the potential side effects involving the induction of the prostate cancer (PCa) neuroendocrine (NE) differentiation remain unclear. Here we found PCa cells could recruit more mast cells than normal prostate epithelial cells, and enzalutamide (or casodex) treatment could further increase such recruitment that resulted in promoting the PCa NE differentiation. Mechanism dissection found infiltrated mast cells could function through positive feedback to enhance PCa to recruit more mast cells via modulation of the androgen receptor (AR)\u00a0\u2192\u00a0cytokines IL8 signals, and interruption by AR-siRNA or neutralizing anti-IL8 antibody could partially reverse the recruitment of mast cells. Importantly, targeting the PCa androgens/AR signals with AR-siRNA or enzalutamide (or casodex) also increased PCa NE differentiation via modulation of the miRNA32 expression, and adding miRNA32 inhibitor reversed the AR-siRNA- or enzalutamide-enhanced NE differentiation.

Microsatellite sequences are found in coding regions and in regulatory regions of genes (i.e., 5\u2032-UTRs and 3\u2032-UTRs). In addition to being a surrogate marker of defective mismatch repair, deletion or insertion microsatellite sequences can dysregulate gene expression in MSI-H (microsatellite instability-high) tumors. The microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) gene product, mPGES-1, participates in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. Moreover, mPGES-1 is often overexpressed in human colorectal tumors, and is thought to contribute to progression of these tumors. Here we identified a dinucleotide repeat, (GT)24, in the mPGES-1 gene 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR), and analyzed its mutation frequencies in MSI-H and microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. The (GT)24 repeat exhibited instability in all MSI-H tumors examined (14), but not in any of the MSS tumors (13). In most cases, (GT)24 repeat instability resulted in insertion of additional GT units. We also determined mPGES-1 mRNA levels in MSI-H and MSS colorectal cancer cell lines. Three of four previously designated \u201cMSI-H\u201d cell lines showed higher mPGES-1 mRNA levels compared to MSS cell lines; correlations between elevated mPGES-1 mRNA levels and microsatellite (GT)24 repeat characteristics are present for all six cell lines. Our results demonstrate that mPGES-1 is a target gene of defective mismatch repair in human colorectal cancer, with functional consequence.",

     "abstract": "Risk factors indicate the importance of oxidative stress during ovarian carcinogenesis. To tolerate oxidative stress, cells activate the transcription factor Nrf2 (Nfe2l2), the master regulator of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. Indeed, for most cancers, hyperactivity of Nrf2 is observed, and siRNA studies assigned Nrf2 as therapeutic target. However, the cancer-protective role of Nrf2 in healthy cells highlights the requirement for an adequate therapeutic window. We engineered artificial transcription factors to assess the role of Nrf2 in healthy (OSE-C2) and malignant ovarian cells (A2780). Successful NRF2 up- and downregulation correlated with decreased, respectively increased, sensitivity toward oxidative stress. Inhibition of NRF2 reduced the colony forming potential to the same extent in wild-type and BRCA1 knockdown A2780 cells. Only in BRCA1 knockdown A2780 cells, the effect of Nrf2 inhibition could be enhanced when combined with PARP inhibitors. Therefore, we propose that this combination therapy of PARP inhibitors and Nrf2 inhibition can further improve treatment efficacy specifically in BRCA1 mutant cancer cells without acquiring the side-effects associated with previously studied Nrf2 inhibition combinations with either chemotherapy or radiation. Our findings stress the dual role of Nrf2 in carcinogenesis, while offering approaches to exploit Nrf2 as a potent therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.",

We developed a test that assigns CN profiles to be \u2018BRCA1-like\u2019 or \u2018non-BRCA1-like\u2019, which refers to resembling a BRCA1-mutated tumor or resembling a tumor without a BRCA1 mutation, respectively. Approximately one third of the BRCA1-like breast cancers have a BRCA1 mutation, one third has hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter and one third has an unknown reason for being BRCA1-like. This classification is indicative of patients' response to high dose alkylating and platinum containing chemotherapy regimens, which targets the inability of BRCA1 deficient cells to repair DNA double strand breaks. We investigated whether this classification can be reliably obtained with next generation sequencing and copy number platforms other than the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) on which it was originally developed.We investigated samples from 230 breast cancer patients for which a CN profile had been generated on two to five platforms, comprising low coverage CN sequencing, CN extraction from targeted sequencing panels (CopywriteR), Affymetrix SNP6.0, 135K/720K oligonucleotide aCGH, Affymetrix Oncoscan FFPE (MIP) technology, 3K BAC and 32K BAC aCGH. Pairwise comparison of genomic position-mapped profiles from the original aCGH platform and other platforms revealed concordance. For most cases, biological differences between samples exceeded the differences between platforms within one sample. We observed the same classification across different platforms in over 80% of the patients and kappa values of at least 0.36. Differential classification could be attributed to CN profiles that were not strongly associated to one class. In conclusion, we have shown that the genomic regions that define our BRCA1-like classifier are robustly measured by different CN profiling technologies, providing the possibility to retro- and prospectively investigate BRCA1-like classification across a wide range of CN platforms.",

We have previously identified miR-135b as a direct regulator of androgen receptor (AR) protein level in prostate cancer (PCa). We wanted to further explore the relationship of miR-135b to hormonal receptors, particularly estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1). Here we show that miR-135b expression is lower in ER\u03b1-positive breast tumors as compared to ER\u03b1-negative samples in two independent breast cancer (BCa) patient cohorts (101 and 1302 samples). Additionally, the miR-135b expression is higher in AR-low PCa patient samples (47 samples). We identify ER\u03b1 as a novel miR-135b target by demonstrating miR-135b binding to the 3\u2032UTR of the ER\u03b1 and decreased ER\u03b1 protein and mRNA level upon miR-135b overexpression in BCa cells. MiR-135b reduces proliferation of ER\u03b1-positive BCa cells MCF-7 and BT-474 as well as AR-positive PCa cells LNCaP and 22Rv1 when grown in 2D. To identify other genes regulated by miR-135b we performed gene expression studies and found a link to the hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) pathway. We show that miR-135b influences the protein level of the inhibitor for hypoxia inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1AN) and is able to bind to HIF1AN 3\u2032UTR. Our study demonstrates that miR-135b regulates ER\u03b1, AR and HIF1AN protein levels through interaction with their 3\u2032UTR regions, and proliferation in ER\u03b1-positive BCa and AR-positive PCa cells.",

Upon searching the website miRbase for possible miR-375 binding sites within the whole MYCN mRNA, we found that the MYCN 5\u2032-UTR had significant sequence complementarity to miR-375, yet no complementary sequences existed within the MYCN 3\u2032-UTR and coding regions. Enforced overexpression of miR-375 efficiently inhibited MYCN mRNA translation and protein synthesis, via an IRES-dependent mechanism. In athymic nude mouse model with human MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma, MYCN downregulation by miR-375 led to inhibition of tumor cell growth and tumorigenicity. In particular, miR-375-regulated inhibition of MYCN translation was enhanced when MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells were exposed to stress stimulation, such as ionizing irradiation (IR), resulting in a remarkable increase in the neuroblastoma's sensitivity to IR-induced cell death. Our results identified a novel mechanism by which IRES-dependent translation of MYCN is repressed by miR-375, particularly during cellular stress, highlighting a potential anticancer strategy: the development of miR-375 as a novel therapeutic agent to treat MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma.",

We found that elevated mgp96 abundance was associated with tumor metastasis and recurrence in patients with primary liver tumors.

The high affinity antibody blocks the binding of the native ligands APRIL and BAFF to BCMA. This finding is rationalized by the high resolution crystal structure of the Fab fragment in complex with the extracellular domain of BCMA. Most importantly, the antibody effectively depletes MM cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo and substantially prolongs tumor-free survival under therapeutic conditions in a xenograft mouse model. A BCMA-antibody-based therapy is therefore a promising option for the effective treatment of multiple myeloma and autoimmune diseases.",

Pharmacotherapies against VS are almost non-existent. Although the therapeutic inhibition of inflammatory modulators has been established for other neoplasms, it has not been explored in VS. A bioinformatic network analysis of all genes reported to be differentially expressed in human VS revealed a pro-inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) as a central molecule in VS pathobiology. Assessed at the transcriptional and translational level, canonical NF-\u03baB complex was aberrantly activated in human VS and derived VS cultures in comparison to control nerves and Schwann cells, respectively. Cultured primary VS cells and VS-derived human cell line HEI-193 were treated with specific NF-\u03baB siRNAs, experimental NF-\u03baB inhibitor BAY11-7082 (BAY11) and clinically relevant NF-\u03baB inhibitor curcumin. Healthy human control Schwann cells from the great auricular nerve were also treated with BAY11 and curcumin to assess toxicity. All three treatments significantly reduced proliferation in primary VS cultures and HEI-193 cells, with siRNA, 5\u00a0\u03bcM BAY11 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM curcumin reducing average proliferation (\u00b1standard error of mean) to 62.33%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.59%, 14.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7%, and 23.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.9% of control primary VS cells, respectively.

Erlotinib-resistant HNSCC cells displayed a significant upregulation in immune response and inflammatory pathways compared to parental cells. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was one of thirteen genes that was significantly differentially expressed in all erlotinib-resistant HNSCC cell lines, which was validated using RT-PCR and ELISA. Blockade of IL-6 signaling using the IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab, was able to overcome erlotinib-resistance in erlotinib-resistant SQ20B tumors in\u00a0vivo.

Aspirated tumor material was used for microarray analysis, and treatment-induced changes (T2 versus T1) in gene expression and standardized uptake values (SUV) were investigated and correlated to clinical outcome measures.Gene expression profiling yielded high-quality data at both time points in 14/18 patients. Unsupervised clustering revealed specific patterns of changes caused by monotherapy vs. combination therapy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021, Fisher's exact test).

     "abstract": "AS1411 is a G-rich quadruplex-forming oligodeoxynucleotide that binds specifically to nucleolin, a protein found on the surface and in the cytoplasm of most malignant cells but absent from the surface/cytoplasm of most normal cells. AS1411 has shown promising clinical activity and is being widely used as a tumor-targeting agent, but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Previously, we showed that AS1411 is taken up in cancer cells by macropinocytosis (fluid phase endocytosis) and subsequently stimulates further macropinocytosis by a nucleolin-dependent mechanism. In the current study, we have investigated the significance and molecular mechanisms of AS1411-induced macropinocytosis. Our results indicate that the antiproliferative activity of AS1411 in various cell lines correlated with its capacity to stimulate macropinocytosis. In DU145 prostate cancer cells, AS1411 induced activation of EGFR, Akt, p38, and Rac1. Activation of Akt and p38 were not critical for AS1411 activity because Akt activation was not observed in all AS1411-responsive cell lines and knockdown of p38 had no effect on AS1411's ability to inhibit proliferation. On the other hand, activation of EGFR and Rac1 appeared to play a role in AS1411 activity in all cancer cell lines examined (DU145, MDA-MB-468, A549, LNCaP) and their inhibition significantly reduced AS1411-mediated macropinocytosis and AS1411 antiproliferative activity. Interestingly, downregulation of nucleolin expression by siRNA also produced a substantial increase in activated Rac1, revealing a previously unknown role for nucleolin as a negative regulator of Rac1 activation. Our results are consistent with a model whereby AS1411 binding to nucleolin leads to sustained activation of Rac1 and causes methuosis, a novel type of nonapoptotic cell death characterized by hyperstimulation of macropinocytosis. We speculate that methuosis is a tumor/metastasis suppressor mechanism that opposes the malignant functions of Rac1 and that cancer cells may overexpress nucleolin to surmount this barrier.",

     "abstract": "Musashi-1 (MSI1) is an RNA-binding protein that acts as a translation activator or repressor of target mRNAs. The best-characterized MSI1 target is Numb mRNA, whose encoded protein negatively regulates Notch signaling. Additional MSI1 targets include the mRNAs for the tumor suppressor protein APC that regulates Wnt signaling and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21WAF\u22121. We hypothesized that increased expression of NUMB, P21 and APC, through inhibition of MSI1 RNA-binding activity might be an effective way to simultaneously downregulate Wnt and Notch signaling, thus blocking the growth of a broad range of cancer cells. We used a fluorescence polarization assay to screen for small molecules that disrupt the binding of MSI1 to its consensus RNA binding site. One of the top hits was (\u2212)-gossypol (Ki\u00a0=\u00a0476\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0273\u00a0nM), a natural product from cottonseed, known to have potent anti-tumor activity and which has recently completed Phase IIb clinical trials for prostate cancer. Surface plasmon resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrate a direct interaction of (\u2212)-gossypol with the RNA binding pocket of MSI1. We further showed that (\u2212)-gossypol reduces Notch/Wnt signaling in several colon cancer cell lines having high levels of MSI1, with reduced SURVIVIN expression and increased apoptosis/autophagy. Finally, we showed that orally administered (\u2212)-gossypol inhibits colon cancer growth in a mouse xenograft model. Our study identifies (\u2212)-gossypol as a potential small molecule inhibitor of MSI1-RNA interaction, and suggests that inhibition of MSI1's RNA binding activity may be an effective anti-cancer strategy.",

This study aimed at evaluating the miR-221 and miR-222 expression profiles in different GIST subtypes and the functional role of these miRNAs. Expression of miR-221 and miR-222 was analysed in six KIT exon 9 and three KIT exon 11 mutated and nine wildtype GISTs by qPCR. Viability and apoptosis were examined in three different, KIT positive GIST cell lines (GIST882, GIST-T1 and GIST48) after overexpression of these miRNAs. The modulation of KIT and the PI3K/AKT pathways was determined by Western blot. Wildtype and KIT mutated GISTs revealed reduced miRNA expression compared to adequate control tissue. miRNA expression was lower for wildtype compared to mutated GISTs. Transient transfection of miR-221 and miR-222 reduced viability and induced apoptosis by inhibition of KIT expression and its phosphorylation and activation of caspases 3 and 7 in all three GIST cell lines. p-AKT, AKT and BCL2 expression was reduced after miRNA transfection whereas only slight influence on p-MTOR, MTOR and BCL2L11 (BIM) was detected. Our results demonstrate that miR-221 and miR-222 which are downregulated in wildtype and mutated GISTs, induce apoptosis in\u00a0vitro by a signalling cascade involving KIT, AKT and BCL2. Therefore, overexpression of these miRNAs seems to functionally counteract oncogenic signalling pathways in GIST.",

     "abstract": "The MET receptor tyrosine kinase is often deregulated in human cancers and several MET inhibitors are evaluated in clinical trials. Similarly to EGFR, MET signals through the RAS-RAF-ERK/MAPK pathway which plays key roles in cell proliferation and survival. Mutations of genes encoding for RAS proteins, particularly in KRAS, are commonly found in various tumors and are associated with constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. It was shown for EGFR, that KRAS mutations render upstream EGFR inhibition ineffective in EGFR-positive colorectal cancers. Currently, there are no clinical studies evaluating MET inhibition impairment due to RAS mutations. To test the impact of RAS mutations on MET targeting, we generated tumor cells responsive to the MET inhibitor EMD1214063 that express KRAS G12V, G12D, G13D and HRAS G12V variants. We demonstrate that these MAPK-activating RAS mutations differentially interfere with MET-mediated biological effects of MET inhibition. We report increased residual ERK1/2 phosphorylation indicating that the downstream pathway remains active in presence of MET inhibition. Consequently, RAS variants counteracted MET inhibition-induced morphological changes as well as anti-proliferative and anchorage-independent growth effects. The effect of RAS mutants was reversed when MET inhibition was combined with MEK inhibitors AZD6244 and UO126. In an in\u00a0vivo mouse xenograft model, MET-driven tumors harboring mutated RAS displayed resistance to MET inhibition. Taken together, our results demonstrate for the first time in details the role of KRAS and HRAS mutations in resistance to MET inhibition and suggest targeting both MET and MEK as an effective strategy when both oncogenic drivers are expressed.",

One of the recent advances in cancer treatment focuses on epigenetic modifiers to alter the survivability and immunogenicity of cancer cells. Our group and others have previously demonstrated that pan-HDAC inhibitors induce apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and changes in the immunogenicity of melanoma cells. Here we interrogated specific HDACs which may be responsible for this effect. We found that both genetic abrogation and pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC6 decreases in\u00a0vitro proliferation and induces G1 arrest of melanoma cell lines without inducing apoptosis. Moreover, targeting this molecule led to an important upregulation in the expression of tumor associated antigens and MHC class I, suggesting a potential improvement in the immunogenicity of these cells. Of note, this anti-melanoma activity was operative regardless of mutational status of the cells. These effects translated into a pronounced delay of in\u00a0vivo melanoma tumor growth which was, at least in part, dependent on intact immunity as evidenced by the restoration of tumor growth after CD4+ and CD8+ depletion. Given our findings, we provide the initial rationale for the further development of selective HDAC6 inhibitors as potential therapeutic anti-melanoma agents.",

CCR4 is also expressed on majority of Tregs, mainly effector Tregs. In this study we have successfully developed three versions of diphtheria-toxin based anti-human CCR4 immunotoxins (monovalent, bivalent and single-chain fold-back diabody). Binding analysis by flow cytometry showed that all three versions of the anti-human CCR4 immunotoxins bound to the human CCR4+ tumor cell line as well as CCR4+ human PBMC. The bivalent isoform bound stronger than its monovalent counterpart and the single-chain foldback diabody isoform was the strongest among the three versions. In\u00a0vitro efficacy analysis demonstrated that the bivalent isoform was 20 fold more potent in inhibiting cellular proliferation and protein synthesis in human CCR4+ tumor cells compared to the monovalent anti-human CCR4 immunotoxin. The single-chain fold-back diabody isoform was 10 fold more potent than its bivalent counterpart and 200 fold more potent than its monovalent counterpart.

Vorinostat, or Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), is a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) classes I & II and has antitumor activity in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Fenretinide (4-HPR) is a synthetic retinoid which acts on cancer cells through both nuclear retinoid receptor and non-receptor mechanisms.

In cancer, loss-of-function of let-7 miRNAs has been linked to tumorigenesis via increased expression of target oncogenes. Excessive proliferation rate of tumor cells is often associated with deregulation of mitotic proteins. Here, we show that let-7b contributes to the maintenance of genomic balance via targeting Aurora B kinase, a key regulator of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Our results indicate that let-7b binds to Aurora B kinase 3\u2032UTR reducing mRNA and protein expression of the kinase. In cells, excess let-7b induced mitotic defects characteristic to Aurora B perturbation including increased rate of polyploidy and multipolarity, and premature SAC inactivation that leads to forced exit from chemically induced mitotic arrest. Moreover, the frequency of aneuploid HCT-116 cells was significantly increased upon let-7b overexpression compared to controls. Interestingly, together with a chemical Aurora B inhibitor, let-7b had an additive effect on polyploidy induction in HeLa cells. In breast cancer patients, reduced let-7b expression was found to be associated with increased Aurora B expression in grade 3 tumors. Furthermore, let-7b was found downregulated in the most aggressive forms of breast cancer determined by clinicopathological parameters. Together, our findings suggest that let-7b contributes to the fidelity of cell division via regulation of Aurora B. Moreover, the loss of let-7b in aggressive tumors may drive tumorigenesis by up-regulation of Aurora B and other targets of the miRNA, which further supports the role of let-7b in tumor suppression.",

     "abstract": "Medulloblastoma (MB) and ependymoma (EP) are the most common pediatric brain tumors, afflicting 3000 children annually. Radiotherapy (RT) is an integral component in the treatment of these tumors; however, the improvement in survival is often accompanied by radiation-induced adverse developmental and psychosocial sequelae. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop strategies that can increase the sensitivity of brain tumors cells to RT while sparing adjacent healthy brain tissue. Apurinic endonuclease 1 (Ape1), an enzyme in the base excision repair pathway, has been implicated in radiation resistance in cancer. Pharmacological and specificity limitations inherent to small molecule inhibitors of Ape1 have hindered their clinical development. Here we report on a nanoparticle (NP) based siRNA delivery vehicle for knocking down Ape1 expression and sensitizing pediatric brain tumor cells to RT. The NP comprises a superparamagnetic iron oxide core coated with a biocompatible, biodegradable coating of chitosan, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and polyethyleneimine (PEI) that is able to bind and protect siRNA from degradation and to deliver siRNA to the perinuclear region of target cells. NPs loaded with siRNA against Ape1 (NP:siApe1) knocked down Ape1 expression over 75% in MB and EP cells, and reduced Ape1 activity by 80%. This reduction in Ape1 activity correlated with increased DNA damage post-irradiation, which resulted in decreased cell survival in clonogenic assays. The sensitization was specific to therapies generating abasic lesions as evidenced by NP:siRNA not increasing sensitivity to paclitaxel, a microtubule disrupting agent. Our results indicate NP-mediated delivery of siApe1 is a promising strategy for circumventing pediatric brain tumor resistance to RT.",

Further understanding of their molecular features and classification might be of clinical value. In this study, we analysed the expression of 105 breast cancer-related genes, including the 50 genes of the PAM50 intrinsic subtype predictor and 12 genes of the Claudin-low subtype predictor, in a panel of 75 FTs (34 FADs, 5 juvenile FADs, 20 benign PTs, 5 borderline PTs and 11 malignant PTs) with clinical follow-up. In addition, we compared the expression profiles of FTs with those of 14 normal breast tissues and 49 primary invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs). Our results revealed that the levels of expression of all breast cancer-related genes can discriminate the various groups of FTs, together with normal breast tissues and IDCs (False Discovery Rate\u00a0<\u00a05%). Among FTs, the levels expression of proliferation-related genes (e.g. CCNB1 and MKI67) and mesenchymal/epithelial-related (e.g. CLDN3 and EPCAM) genes were found to be most discriminative. As expected, FADs showed the highest and lowest expression of epithelial- and proliferation-related genes, respectively, whereas malignant PTs showed the opposite expression pattern. Interestingly, the overall profile of benign PTs was found more similar to FADs and normal breast tissues than the rest of tumours, including juvenile FADs. Within the dataset of IDCs and normal breast tissues, the vast majority of FADs, juvenile FADs, benign PTs and borderline PTs were identified as Normal-like by intrinsic breast cancer subtyping, whereas 7 (63.6%) and 3 (27.3%) malignant PTs were identified as Claudin-low and Basal-like, respectively. Finally, we observed that the previously described PAM50 risk of relapse prognostic score better predicted outcome in FTs than the morphological classification, even within PTs-only. Our results suggest that classification of FTs using gene expression-based data is feasible and might provide clinically useful biological and prognostic information.",

However, its roles and associated molecular mechanisms underlying oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) initiation and progression remain largely unknown. Here, we identified TAZ, the downstream effector of Hippo signaling, as a novel bona fide oncogene by promoting cell proliferation, migration/invasion and chemoresistance in OSCC. TAZ promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and also was involved in TGF-\u03b21-induced EMT in oral cancer cells. Furthermore, enriched TAZ sustained self-renewal, maintenance, tumor-seeding potential of oral cancer stem cells (CSCs). Remarkably, enforced TAZ overexpression conferred CSCs-like properties on differentiated non-CSCs and fueled phenotypic transition from non-CSCs to CSCs-like cells. Mechanistically, TAZ-TEADs binding and subsequent transcriptional activation of EMT mediators and pluripotency factors are presumably responsible for TAZ-mediated EMT and non-CSCs-to-CSCs conversion. Importantly, aberrant TAZ overexpression was found to be associated with tumor size, pathological grade and cervical lymph node metastasis, as well as unfavorable prognosis. Pharmacological repression of TAZ by simvastatin resulted in potent anti-cancer effects against OSCC. Taken together, our findings have revealed critical links between TAZ, EMT and CSCs in OSCC initiation and progression, and also established TAZ as a novel cancer biomarker and viable druggable target for OSCC therapeutics.",

These molecular subtypes of breast cancer are associated with poor overall survival. We focused on mechanisms of NF-\u03baB regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate eukaryotic gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In a previous genome-wide miRNA screen, we had identified miR-30c-2-3p as one of the strongest negative regulators of NF-\u03baB signaling. Here we have uncovered the underlying molecular mechanisms and its consequences in breast cancer. In\u00a0vitro results show that miR-30c-2-3p directly targets both TNFRSF1A-associated via death domain (TRADD), an adaptor protein of the TNFR/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, and the cell cycle protein Cyclin E1 (CCNE1). Ectopic expression of miR-30c-2-3p downregulated essential cytokines IL8, IL6, CXCL1, and reduced cell proliferation as well as invasion in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. RNA interference (RNAi) induced silencing of TRADD phenocopied the effects on invasion and cytokine expression caused by miR-30c-2-3p, while inhibition of CCNE1 phenocopied the effects on cell proliferation. We further confirmed the tumor suppressive role of this miRNA using a dataset of 781 breast tumors, where higher expression was associated with better survival in breast cancer patients. In summary we have elucidated the mechanism by which miR-30c-2-3p negatively regulates NF-\u03baB signaling and cell cycle progression in breast cancer.",

However, little is known regarding specific features of tumor-associated stromal tissues and response to (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. This study investigated the predictive value of extracellular matrix organization on response to chemotherapy in patients treated in the NEOZOTAC trial.Stromal organisation was analyzed via a simple method using image analysis software on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides from primary tumor biopsies collected as part of the NEOZOTAC trial. Heidenhain's AZAN trichrome-stained slides were also analyzed for comparison of collagen evaluation. Sections were stained for phospho-Smad2 (pS2) in order to determine the relationship of TGF-\u03b2 signaling with stromal organization.A statistically significant relationship was observed between stroma consisting of organised collagen and pathological response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Odds Ratio 0.276, 95%CI 0.124\u20130.614, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

Each of them was found to be independent prognostic markers on the gene expression level, as well as on the protein level. A prognostic profile was identified by combining the nuclear expression scores of the three proteins. For patients with completely resected tumours only 15% in the high risk group were alive after two years, as compared to 78% in the low risk group.In conclusion, we found a novel protein expression profile which identifies MPNST patients with inferior prognosis even after assumed curative surgery. The tested proteins are drug targets; therefore the expression profile may provide predictive information guiding the design of future clinical trials. Importantly, as the effect is seen on the protein level using IHC, the biomarker panel can be readily implemented in routine clinical testing.",

In addition, NFAT1-induced genes play diverse roles in mediating the progression of various solid tumors.

Thapsigargin stimulation of breast cancer cells induces IL8 expression in an NFAT-dependent manner. Moreover, we show that NFAT1-mediated IL8 production promotes the migration of primary human neutrophils in\u00a0vitro and also promotes neutrophil infiltration in tumor xenografts. Furthermore, expression of active NFAT1 effectively suppresses the growth of nascent and established tumors by a non cell-autonomous mechanism. Evaluation of breast tumor tissue reveals that while the levels of NFAT1 are similar in tumor cells and normal breast epithelium, cells in the tumor stroma express higher levels of NFAT1 compared to normal stroma. Elevated levels of NFAT1 also correlate with increased neutrophil infiltrate in breast tumors. These data point to a mechanism by which NFAT1 orchestrates the communication between breast cancer cells and host neutrophils during breast cancer progression.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells often have increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, acquisition of redox adaptive mechanisms allows for evasion of ROS-mediated death. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a distinct, advanced BC subtype characterized by high rates of residual disease and recurrence despite advances in multimodality treatment. Using a cellular model of IBC, we identified an oxidative stress response (OSR) signature in surviving IBC cells after administration of an acute dose of an ROS inducer. Metagene analysis of patient samples revealed significantly higher OSR scores in IBC tumor samples compared to normal or non-IBC tissues, which may contribute to the poor response of IBC tumors to common treatment strategies, which often rely heavily on ROS induction. To combat this adaptation, we utilized a potent redox modulator, the FDA-approved small molecule Disulfiram (DSF), alone and in combination with copper. DSF forms a complex with copper (DSF-Cu) increasing intracellular copper concentration both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, bypassing the need for membrane transporters. DSF-Cu antagonized NF\u03baB signaling, aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and antioxidant levels, inducing oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in multiple IBC cellular models. In\u00a0vivo, DSF-Cu significantly inhibited tumor growth without significant toxicity, causing apoptosis only in tumor cells. These results indicate that IBC\u00a0tumors are highly redox adapted, which may render them resistant to ROS-inducing therapies. DSF, through redox modulation, may be a useful approach to enhance chemo- and/or radio-sensitivity for advanced BC subtypes where therapeutic resistance is an impediment to durable responses to current standard of care.",

We characterized the resistant cell line variants with regards to their drug resistance profile and transcriptome, and matched our results with datasets generated from relevant clinical material to derive putative resistance biomarkers. We found that the chemoresistant cell line variants had distinctive irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-specific resistance profiles, with non-reciprocal cross-resistance.

The telomere fusion threshold defined a small subset of patients with an extremely poor clinical outcome, with a median survival of less than 12 months (HR\u00a0=\u00a021.4 (7.9\u201357.6), P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Furthermore, this telomere length threshold was independent of ER, PGR, HER2 status, NPI, or grade and was the dominant variable in multivariate analysis.

OPB-31121, an anticancer compound currently in clinical trials, has been reported to affect STAT3 signaling, although its mechanism of action has not been unequivocally demonstrated. In this study, we used a combined computational and experimental approach to investigate the molecular target and the mode of interaction of OPB-31121 with STAT3. In parallel, similar studies were performed with known STAT3 inhibitors (STAT3i) to validate our approach. Computational docking and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) showed that OPB-31121 interacted with high affinity with the SH2 domain of STAT3. Interestingly, there was no overlap of the OPB-31121 binding site with those of the other STAT3i. Computational predictions were confirmed by in\u00a0vitro binding assays and competition experiments along with site-directed mutagenesis of critical residues in the STAT3 SH2 domain. Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments demonstrated the remarkably high affinity of OPB-31121 for STAT3 with Kd (10\u00a0nM) 2\u20133 orders lower than other STAT3i. Notably, a similar ranking of the potency of the compounds was observed in terms of inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation, cancer cell proliferation and clonogenicity. These results suggest that the high affinity and efficacy of OPB-31121 might be related to the unique features and mode of interaction of OPB-31121 with STAT3.

Furthermore, Mismatch Repair (MMR) subtypes of CRC have been associated with benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy of primary CRC. Given the involvement of the topoisomerase enzymes in DNA replication and repair, we raised the hypothesis that an association may exist between TOP gene copy numbers and MMR proficiency/deficiency in CRC.Test cohort : FISH analysis with an in-house TOP1/CEN20 probe mix and a commercially available TOP2A/CEN17 (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) probe mix was performed on archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 18 patients with proficient MMR (pMMR) CRC and 18 patients with deficient MMR (dMMR) CRC. TOP1 and TOP2A gene copy numbers and their ratios per nucleus were correlated with MMR status using the Mann\u2013Whitney test. Validation cohort : FFPE samples from 154 patients with primary stage III CRC (originally included in the RANX05 study) were classified according to MMR status by immunohistochemical analysis using validated antibodies for MLH1, MLH2, MSH6 and PMS2, and information on TOP1, CEN20, TOP2A and CEN17 status was previously published for this cohort.The observed TOP1 gene copy numbers in the 36 CRC test cohort were significantly greater (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the pMMR subgroup (mean: 3.84, SD: 2.03) than in the dMMR subgroup (mean: 1.50, SD: 0.12). Similarly, the TOP2A copy numbers were significantly greater (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in the pMMR subgroup (mean: 1.99, SD: 0.52) than in the dMMR subgroup (mean: 1.52, SD: 0.10). These findings were confirmed in the validation cohort, where in the pMMR subgroup 51% had \u22652 extra TOP1 copies per cell, while all tumors classified as dMMR had diploid TOP1 status and mean TOP2A copy numbers were 2.30 (SD: 1.36) and 1.80 (SD: 0.31) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) in the pMMR subgroup vs. dMMR subgroup, respectively.Our results show that TOP1 and TOP2A gene copy numbers are increased in the pMMR subgroup. We propose that this preference may reflect a selective pressure to gain and/or maintain the gained extra copies of topoisomerase genes whose products are required to cope with high replication stress present in the pMMR tumors, thereby providing a survival advantage selectively in pMMR tumors. Future studies should test this concept and explore potential differences between pMMR and dMMR tumors in response to Top1 and Top2 inhibitors.",

A tumor biomarker may be identified and measured by one or more assays, or tests, for the biomarker. Increasingly, tumor biomarker tests are being used to drive patient management, either by identifying patients who do not require any, or any further, treatment, or by identifying patients whose tumors are so unlikely to respond to a given type of treatment that it will cause more harm than good. A tumor biomarker assay should only be used to guide management if it has analytical validity, meaning that it is accurate, reproducible, and reliable, and if it has been shown to have clinical utility. The latter implies that high levels of evidence are available that demonstrate that application of the tumor biomarker test for a given use context results in better outcomes, or similar outcomes with less cost, than if the assay were not applied. Use contexts include risk categorization, screening, differential diagnosis, prognosis, prediction of therapeutic activity or monitoring disease course.

However, there is recognized heterogeneity within any given tumor-type from patient to patient (inter-patient heterogeneity), and within an individual (intra-patient heterogeneity) as demonstrated by molecular evolution through space (primary tumor to metastasis) and time (after therapy). These issues have become hurdles to advancing cancer treatment outcomes with novel molecularly targeted agents. Classic trial design paradigms are challenged by heterogeneity, as they are unable to test targeted therapeutics against low frequency genomic \u2018oncogenic driver\u2019 aberrations with adequate power. Usual accrual difficulties to clinical trials are exacerbated by low frequencies of any given molecular driver. To address these challenges, there is need for innovative clinical trial designs and strategies implementing novel diagnostic biomarker technologies to account for inter-patient molecular diversity and scarce tissue for analysis. Importantly, there is also need for pre-defined treatment priority algorithms given numerous aberrations commonly observed within any one individual sample. Access to multiple available therapeutic agents simultaneously is crucial. Finally intra-patient heterogeneity through time may be addressed by serial biomarker assessment at the time of tumor progression.

Therefore utilizing a dose escalation method that has toxicity based endpoints may not be as appropriate for determination of recommended dose, and alternative parameters such as pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic outcomes are potentially appealing options. Approaches to enhance safety and optimize dosing include improved preclinical models and assessment, innovative model based design and dose escalation strategies, patient selection, the use of expansion cohorts and extended toxicity assessments. Tailoring the design of phase I trials by adopting new strategies to address the different properties of MTAs is required to enhance the development of these agents.

Combining the CellSearch\u00ae and DEPArray\u2122 technologies allows the recovery of single CTCs as a pure sample for molecular analysis.The purpose of the study was to investigate the heterogeneity of PIK3CA mutational status within single CTCs isolated from individual mBC patients.CTCs were enriched and enumerated by CellSearch\u00ae in blood samples collected from 39 mBC patients. In 20 out of 39 patients enriched samples with \u22655 CTCs were sorted using DEParray\u2122 to isolate single CTCs or pools of CTCs to be submitted to Whole Genome Amplification (WGA) before sequencing analysis. In 18 out of 20 patients, it was possible to perform PIK3CA sequencing on exons 9 and 20.Twelve subjects were wild type (wt) for the PIK3CA gene. PIK3CA status could also be assessed in pools of CTCs in seven of these patients, with consistent wt status found. Six patients (33%) had a PIK3CA mutation identified. In 2 of the six patients, molecular heterogeneity was detected when mutational analysis was performed on more than one single CTC, including one patient with loss of heterozygosity on both single and pooled CTCs, and one patient with three different PIK3CA variants on single CTCs but PIK3CA wt status on pooled CTC samples. In six out of the 18 cases PIK3CA status was also evaluable on a primary tumor sample. In one of the six cases a discordance in PIK3CA status between the primary (wild-type) and the matched CTC (exon 20 mutation) was observed.This study demonstrates the feasibility of a non-invasive approach based on the liquid biopsy in mBC patients.Moreover, our data suggest the importance of characterizing CTCs at the single cell level in order to investigate the molecular heterogeneity within cells from the same patient.",

The prognosis depends on the histological subtype, as well as on the anatomical site of origin, the former being the more important. The molecular basis for these differences in prognosis is poorly understood. Whole-genome analyses were used to investigate the association between molecular tumor profiles, pathogenesis and prognosis. A total of 85 periampullary adenocarcinomas were characterized by mRNA and miRNA expressions profiling. Molecular profiles of the tumors from the different anatomical sites of origin as well as of the different histological subtypes were compared. Differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs between the two histopathological subtypes were linked to specific molecular pathways. Six miRNA families were downregulated and four were upregulated in the pancreatobiliary type as compared to the intestinal type (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). miRNAs and mRNAs associated with improved overall and recurrence free survival for the two histopathological subtypes were identified. For the pancreatobiliary type the genes ATM, PTEN, RB1 and the miRNAs miR-592 and miR-497, and for the intestinal type the genes PDPK1, PIK3R2, G6PC and the miRNAs miR-127-3p, miR-377* were linked to enriched pathways and identified as prognostic markers.

These potential precursor genes map significantly more frequently to 1q and 16q, regions frequently targeted by gene copy number alterations in LCIS and ILC.Here we demonstrate that classic LCIS is a heterogeneous disease at the transcriptomic level and identify potential precursor genes in lobular carcinogenesis.

Oncolytic adenoviruses are a novel therapy for human malignancies that are being evaluated in early phase trials. However, there are no reliable predictive biomarkers for oncolytic adenovirus activity in ovarian cancer. We investigated the link between paclitaxel resistance and oncolytic adenovirus activity using established ovarian cancer cell line models, xenografts with de novo paclitaxel resistance and tumour samples from two separate trials. The activity of multiple Ad5 vectors, including dl922-947 (E1A CR2-deleted), dl1520 (E1B-55K deleted) and Ad5 WT, was significantly increased in paclitaxel resistant ovarian cancer in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. This was associated with greater infectivity resulting from increased expression of the primary receptor for Ad5, CAR (coxsackie adenovirus receptor). This, in turn, resulted from increased CAR transcription secondary to histone modification in resistant cells. There was increased CAR expression in intraperitoneal tumours with de novo paclitaxel resistance and in tumours from patients with clinical resistance to paclitaxel. Increased CAR expression did not cause paclitaxel resistance, but did increase inflammatory cytokine expression. Finally, we identified dysregulated cell cycle control as a second mechanism of increased adenovirus efficacy in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer. Ad11 and Ad35, both group B adenoviruses that utilise non-CAR receptors to infect cells, are also significantly more effective in paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cell models. Inhibition of CDK4/6 using PD-0332991 was able both to reverse paclitaxel resistance and reduce adenovirus efficacy. Thus, paclitaxel resistance increases oncolytic adenovirus efficacy via at least two separate mechanisms \u2013 if validated further, this information could have future clinical utility to aid patient selection for clinical trials.",

Thus, agents which can inhibit STAT3 activation may have an enormous potential for treatment of HCC patients. Hence, in the present report, we investigated the effect of ascochlorin (ASC), an isoprenoid antibiotic on STAT3 activation cascade in various HCC cell lines and orthotopic mouse model. We observed that ASC could substantially inhibit both constitutive and IL-6/EGF inducible STAT3 activation as well as reduce its DNA binding ability. ASC increased the expression of protein inhibitor of activated STAT3 (PIAS3) which could bind to STAT3 DNA binding domain and thereby down-regulate STAT3 activation. Deletion of PIAS3 gene by siRNA abolished the ability of ASC to inhibit STAT3 activation and induce apoptosis in HCC cells. ASC also modulated the expression of diverse STAT3-regulated oncogenic gene products.

Overall our results indicate that ASC mediates its anti-tumor effects predominantly through the suppression of STAT3 signaling cascade, and can form the basis of novel therapy for HCC patients.",

     "abstract": "Peritoneal dissemination is a major clinical obstacle in gastrointestinal cancer therapy, and it accounts for the majority of cancer-related mortality. Calreticulin (CRT) is over-expressed in gastric tumors and has been linked to poor prognosis. In this study, immunohistochemistry studies revealed that the up-regulation of CRT was associated with lymph node and distant metastasis in patients with gastric cancer specimens. CRT was significantly down-regulated in highly metastatic gastric cancer cell lines and metastatic animal by Honokiol-treated. Small RNA interference blocking CRT by siRNA-CRT was translocated to the cells in the early immunogenic response to Honokiol. Honokiol activated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and down-regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) activity resulting in PPAR\u03b3 and CRT degradation through calpain-II activity, which could be reversed by siRNA-calpain-II. The Calpain-II/PPAR\u03b3/CRT axis and interaction evoked by Honokiol could be blocked by gene silencing or pharmacological agents. Both transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) induced cell migration, invasion and reciprocal down-regulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin, which could be abrogated by siRNA-CRT. Moreover, Honokiol significantly suppressed MNNG-induced gastrointestinal tumor growth and over-expression of CRT in mice. Knockdown CRT in gastric cancer cells was found to effectively reduce growth ability and metastasis in vivo. The present study provides insight into the specific biological behavior of CRT in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis. Taken together, our results suggest that the therapeutic inhibition of CRT by Honokiol suppresses both gastric tumor growth and peritoneal dissemination by dictating early translocation of CRT in immunogenic cell death, activating ER stress, and blocking EMT.",

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) obtained non-invasively from peripheral blood could serve as a tumor proxy. Using a label-free CTC enrichment strategy that we have established, we aimed to develop sensitive assays for qualitative assessment of tumor genotype in patients. Blood consecutively obtained from 44 patients with local and advanced colorectal cancer and 18 healthy donors were enriched for CTCs using a size-based microsieve technology. To screen for CTC mutations, we established high-resolution melt (HRM) and allele-specific PCR (ASPCR) KRAS-codon 12/13- and BRAF-codon 600- specific assays, and compared the performance with pyrosequencing and Sanger sequencing. For each patient, the resulting CTC genotypes were compared with matched tumor and normal tissues. Both HRM and ASPCR could detect as low as 1.25% KRAS- or BRAF-mutant alleles. HRM detected 14/44 (31.8%) patients with KRAS mutation in CTCs and 5/44 (11.3%) patients having BRAF mutation in CTCs. ASPCR detected KRAS and BRAF mutations in CTCs of 10/44 (22.7%) and 1/44 (2.3%) patients respectively. There was an increased detection of mutation in blood using these two methods. Comparing tumor tissues and CTCs mutation status using HRM, we observed 84.1% concordance in KRAS genotype (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000129, Fishers' exact test; OR\u00a0=\u00a038.7, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a04.05\u2013369) and 90.9% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.174) concordance in BRAF genotype.

     "abstract": "Alterations in glycan structures are early signs of malignancy and have recently been proposed to be in part a driving force behind malignant transformation. Here, we explore whether differences in expression of genes related to the process of glycosylation exist between breast carcinoma subtypes \u2013 and look for their association to clinical parameters.Five expression datasets of 454 invasive breast carcinomas, 31 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), and 79 non-malignant breast tissue samples were analysed. Results were validated in 1960 breast carcinomas. 419 genes encoding glycosylation-related proteins were selected.The DCIS samples appeared expression-wise similar to carcinomas, showing altered gene expression related to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and N-glycans when compared to non-malignant samples. In-situ lesions with different aggressiveness potentials demonstrated changes in glycosaminoglycan sulfation and adhesion proteins. Subtype-specific expression patterns revealed down-regulation of genes encoding glycan-binding proteins in the luminal A and B subtypes. Clustering basal-like samples using a consensus list of genes differentially expressed across discovery datasets produced two clusters with significantly differing prognosis in the validation dataset. Finally, our analyses suggest that glycolipids may play an important role in carcinogenesis of breast tumors \u2013 as demonstrated by association of B3GNT5 and UGCG genes to patient survival.In conclusion, most glycan-specific changes occur early in the carcinogenic process. We have identified glycan-related alterations specific to breast cancer subtypes including a prognostic signature for two basal-like subgroups. Future research in this area may potentially lead to markers for better prognostication and treatment stratification of breast cancer patients.",

The identification of genomic aberrations characteristic for BRCA1-mutated breast carcinomas could lead to a better understanding of BRCA1-associated oncogenic events and could prove valuable in clinical testing for BRCA1-involvement in patients.For this purpose, genomic and gene expression profiles of basal-like BRCA1-mutated breast tumors (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were compared with basal-like familial BRCAX (non-BRCA1/2/CHEK2*1100delC) tumors (n\u00a0=\u00a014) in a familial cohort of 120 breast carcinomas.Genome wide copy number profiles of the BRCA1-mutated breast carcinomas in our data appeared heterogeneous. Gene expression analyses identified varying amounts of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) as a major cause for this heterogeneity. Indeed, selecting tumors with relative low amounts of TILs, resulted in the identification of three known but also five previously unrecognized BRCA1-associated copy number aberrations. Moreover, these aberrations occurred with high frequencies in the BRCA1-mutated tumor samples. Using these regions it was possible to discriminate BRCA1-mutated from BRCAX breast carcinomas, and they were validated in two independent cohorts. To further substantiate our findings, we used flow cytometry to isolate cancer cells from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, BRCA1-mutated triple negative breast carcinomas with estimated TIL percentages of 40% and higher. Genomic profiles of sorted and unsorted fractions were compared by shallow whole genome sequencing and confirm our findings.This study shows that genomic profiling of in particular basal-like, and thus BRCA1-mutated, breast carcinomas is severely affected by the presence of high numbers of TILs. Previous reports on genomic profiling of BRCA1-mutated breast carcinomas have largely neglected this. Therefore, our findings have direct consequences on the interpretation of published genomic data. Also, these findings could prove valuable in light of currently used genomic tools for assessing BRCA1-involvement in breast cancer patients and pathogenicity assessment of BRCA1 variants of unknown significance. The BRCA1-associated genomic aberrations identified in this study provide possible leads to a better understanding of BRCA1-associated oncogenesis.",

In the present study, we analyzed CBD's anti-tumorigenic activity against highly aggressive breast cancer cell lines including TNBC subtype. We show here -for the first time-that CBD significantly inhibits epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced proliferation and chemotaxis of breast cancer cells. Further studies revealed that CBD inhibits EGF-induced activation of EGFR, ERK, AKT and NF-kB signaling pathways as well as MMP2 and MMP9 secretion. In addition, we demonstrated that CBD inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in different mouse model systems. Analysis of molecular mechanisms revealed that CBD significantly inhibits the recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages in primary tumor stroma and secondary lung metastases. Similarly, our in\u00a0vitro studies showed a significant reduction in the number of migrated RAW 264.7 cells towards the conditioned medium of CBD-treated cancer cells. The conditioned medium of CBD-treated cancer cells also showed lower levels of GM-CSF and CCL3 cytokines which are important for macrophage recruitment and activation. In summary, our study shows -for the first time-that CBD inhibits breast cancer growth and metastasis through novel mechanisms by inhibiting EGF/EGFR signaling and modulating the tumor microenvironment. These results also indicate that CBD can be used as a novel therapeutic option to inhibit growth and metastasis of highly aggressive breast cancer subtypes including TNBC, which currently have limited therapeutic options and are associated with poor prognosis and low survival rates.",

In all samples, 95 mRNAs were measured by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). HD blood samples and patient samples with three or more CTCs were compared to identify CTC-specific mRNAs. Patient samples without detectable CTCs were separately analyzed.Thirty-four CTC-specific mRNAs were higher expressed in patients with \u22653 CTCs compared with HDs (Mann\u2013Whitney U-test P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Presence of disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) in the bone marrow (BM) at diagnosis and at relapse is a common event in stage M neuroblastomas. Although the clinical heterogeneity of disseminated neuroblastomas is frequently associated with genomic diversity, so far, only little information exists about the genomic status of DTCs. This lack of knowledge is mainly due to the varying amount of BM infiltrating tumor cells, which is usually below 30% even at diagnosis thereby hampering systematic analyses. Thus, a valuable chance to analyze metastatic and relapse clones is, so far, completely unexploited. In this study, we show that the enrichment of tumor cells in fresh or DMSO frozen BM samples with a minimum of 0.05% or 0.1% infiltration rate, respectively, by applying magnetic bead-based technique increased the DTC content to a sufficient level to allow SNP array analyses in 49 out of 69 samples.

We explored DNA methylation-based signatures in association with breast cancer subtypes to assess their impact on clinical presentation and patient prognosis. DNA methylation was analyzed using Infinium 450K arrays in 40 tumors and 17 normal breast samples, together with DNA copy number changes and subtype-specific markers by tissue microarrays. The identified methylation signatures were validated against a cohort of 212 tumors annotated for breast cancer subtypes by the PAM50 method (The Cancer Genome Atlas). Selected markers were pyrosequenced in an independent validation cohort of 310 tumors and analyzed with respect to survival, clinical stage and grade. The results demonstrate that DNA methylation patterns linked to the luminal-B subtype are characterized by CpG island promoter methylation events. In contrast, a large fraction of basal-like tumors are characterized by hypomethylation events occurring within the gene body. Based on these hallmark signatures, we defined two DNA methylation-based subtypes, Epi-LumB and Epi-Basal, and show that they are associated with unfavorable clinical parameters and reduced survival. Our data show that distinct mechanisms leading to changes in CpG methylation states are operative in different breast cancer subtypes.

Pre-clinically, biological consequences of ATR gene knock down or ATR inhibition by the small molecule inhibitor (VE-821) were investigated in MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF10A). High ATR and high cytoplasmic pCHEK1 levels were significantly associated with higher tumour stage, higher mitotic index, pleomorphism and lymphovascular invasion. In univariate analyses, high ATR and high cytoplasmic pCHEK1 levels were associated with poor breast cancer specific survival (BCSS). In multivariate analysis, high ATR level remains an independent predictor of adverse outcome. At the mRNA level, high CHEK1 remains associated with aggressive phenotypes including lymph node positivity, high grade, Her-2 overexpression, triple negative, aggressive molecular phenotypes and adverse BCSS. Pre-clinically, CHEK1 phosphorylation at serine345 following replication stress was impaired in ATR knock down and in VE-821 treated breast cancer cells. Doxycycline inducible knockdown of ATR suppressed growth, which was restored when ATR was re-expressed. Similarly, VE-821 treatment resulted in a dose dependent suppression of cancer cell growth and survival (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231) but was less toxic in non-tumorigenic breast epithelial cells (MCF10A).

Little is known about the clinical significance of HER family mutations in breast cancer. Because mutations within HER1/EGFR are predictive of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in lung cancer, we investigated whether mutations in HER family kinase domains are predictive of response to targeted therapy in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. We sequenced the HER family kinase domains from 76 HER2-overexpressing invasive carcinomas and identified 12 missense variants. Patients whose tumors carried any of these mutations did not respond to HER2 directed therapy in the metastatic setting. We developed mutant cell lines and used structural analyses to determine whether changes in protein conformation could explain the lack of response to therapy. We also functionally studied all HER2 mutants and showed that they conferred an aggressive phenotype and altered effects of the TKI lapatinib. Our data demonstrate that mutations in the finely tuned HER kinase domains play a critical function in breast cancer progression and may serve as prognostic and predictive markers.",

However, how are such oncogene-induced effects evoked and temporally related, to what extent are these kinetic parameters shared by Myc and Ras, and how are these cellular changes linked with oncogene-induced cellular senescence in different cell context(s) remain poorly understood. Here, we addressed the above-mentioned open questions by multifaceted comparative analyses of human cellular models with inducible expression of c-Myc and H-RasV12 (Ras), two commonly deregulated oncoproteins operating in a functionally connected signaling network. Our study of DNA replication parameters using the DNA fiber approach and time-course assessment of perturbations in glycolytic flux, oxygen consumption and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) revealed the following results. First, overabundance of nuclear Myc triggered RS promptly, already after one day of Myc induction, causing slow replication fork progression and fork asymmetry, even before any metabolic changes occurred. In contrast, Ras overexpression initially induced a burst of cell proliferation and increased the speed of replication fork progression. However, after several days of induction Ras caused bioenergetic metabolic changes that correlated with slower DNA replication fork progression and the ensuing cell cycle arrest, gradually leading to senescence. Second, the observed oncogene-induced RS and metabolic alterations were cell-type/context dependent, as shown by comparative analyses of normal human BJ fibroblasts versus U2-OS sarcoma cells. Third, the energy metabolic reprogramming triggered by Ras was more robust compared to impact of Myc. Fourth, the detected oncogene-induced oxidative stress was due to ROS (superoxide) of non-mitochondrial origin and mitochondrial OXPHOS was reduced (Crabtree effect). Overall, our study provides novel insights into oncogene-evoked metabolic reprogramming, replication and oxidative stress, with implications for mechanisms of tumorigenesis and potential targeting of oncogene addiction.",

Here we present data showing that short-interfering RNA mediated depletion of the protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in cell-lines representative of NBs with MYCN gene amplification leads to greatly impaired growth and apoptosis. Growth suppression is not apparent in the MYCN-negative SH-SY5Y NB cell-line, or in two immortalized human fibroblast cell-lines. Immunoblotting of NB cell-lines shows that high PRMT5 expression is strongly associated with MYCN-amplification (P < 0.004, Mann\u2013Whitney U-test) and immunohistochemical analysis of primary NBs reveals that whilst PRMT5 protein is ubiquitously expressed in the cytoplasm of most cells, MYCN-amplified tumours exhibit pronounced nuclear PRMT5 staining. PRMT5 knockdown in MYCN-overexpressing cells, including the SHEP-21N cell-line with inducible MYCN expression leads to a dramatic decrease in MYCN protein and MYCN-associated cell-death in SHEP-21N cells. Quantitative gene expression analysis and cycloheximide chase experiments suggest that PRMT5 regulates MYCN at a post-transcriptional level. Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that endogenous PRMT5 and MYCN interact in both SK-N-BE(2)C and NGP cell lines. By using liquid chromatography \u2013 tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis of immunoprecipitated MYCN protein, we identified several potential sites of arginine dimethylation on the MYCN protein. Together our studies implicate PRMT5 in a novel mode of MYCN post-translational regulation and suggest PRMT5 plays a major role in NB tumorigenesis. Small-molecule inhibitors of PRMT5 may therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma and other cancers driven by the MYCN oncogene.",

     "abstract": "Taxane-based chemotherapy is an effective treatment for castration-resistant-prostate cancer (CRPC) via stabilization of microtubules. Previous studies identified that the inhibitory effect of microtubule-targeting chemotherapy on androgen receptor (AR) activity was conferred by interfering with AR intracellular trafficking. The N-terminal domain (NTD) of AR was identified as a tubulin-interacting domain that can be effectively targeted by the novel small molecule inhibitor, EPI. Taken together this evidence provided the rationale that targeting AR nuclear translocation and activity via a combination of an antagonist of the AR NTD and taxane-based chemotherapy may enhance the therapeutic response in CRPC. The present study investigated the anti-tumor efficacy of a combination of EPI with Docetaxel chemotherapy, in cell models of CRPC, harboring the AR splice variants in addition to the full length AR. Our findings demonstrate that there was no significant effect on the androgen-mediated nuclear transport of AR variants and AR transcriptional activity by Docetaxel. The therapeutic response to Docetaxel was enhanced by inhibition of the NTD of AR (by EPI) through cycling of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) to mesenchymal-epithelial-transition (MET) among prostate cancer epithelial cells. These results support that transient \u201cprogramming\u201d of EMT by the AR NTD inhibitor, potentially drives the sensitivity of prostate tumors with differential distribution of AR variants to microtubule-targeting chemotherapy. This study is of major significance in dissecting mechanisms to overcome taxane resistance in advanced CRPC.",

Deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been associated with GBM progression through alterations in either oncogenic or tumor suppressor targets. Here, we elucidated the function and the possible molecular mechanisms of miR-449a in human GBM cell lines and tumor specimens-derived glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs). Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that miR-449a was down-regulated in human GBM cell lines and GSCs. Functionally, miR-449a acted as a tumor suppressor by reducing cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as inducing apoptosis in human GBM cell lines and GSCs. Myc-associated zinc-finger protein (MAZ) was identified as a direct target of miR-449a, mediating these tumor-suppressive effects, demonstrated by Western blot assay and luciferase assays. Moreover, over-expression of miR-449a inhibited the expression of Podoplanin (PDPN) by down-regulating MAZ which could positively control the promoter activities via binding to the promoter of PDPN, demonstrated by luciferase assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Further, the PI3K/AKT pathway was blocked when MAZ was down-regulated by miR-449a. This process was coincided with the up-regulation of apoptotic proteins and the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins, MMP2 and MMP9. Furthermore, nude mice carrying over-expressed miR-449a combined with knockdown MAZ tumors produced the smallest tumors and the highest survival. These results elucidated a novel molecular mechanism of GBM progression, and may thus suggest a promising application for GBM treatment.",

An ongoing challenge in breast cancer research is to distinguish high-risk patients from good prognosis patients. This is particularly difficult in the low-grade, ER-positive luminal A tumors, where robust diagnostic tools to aid clinical treatment decisions are lacking. Recent data implicating chromatin regulators in cancer initiation and progression offers a promising avenue to develop new tools to help guide clinical decisions.Here we exploit a published transcriptome dataset and an independent validation cohort to correlate the mRNA expression of selected chromatin regulators with respect to the four intrinsic breast cancer molecular subtypes. We then perform univariate and multivariate analyses to compare the prognostic value of a panel of chromatin regulators to Ki67, a currently utilized proliferation marker.Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed a gene cluster containing several histone chaperones and histone variants highly-expressed in the proliferative subtypes (basal-like, HER2-positive, luminal B) but not in the luminal A subtype. Several chromatin regulators, including the histone chaperones CAF-1 (subunits p150 and p60), ASF1b, and HJURP, and the centromeric histone variant CENP-A, associated with local and metastatic relapse and poor patient outcome. Importantly, we find that HJURP can discriminate favorable and unfavorable outcome within the luminal A subtype, outperforming the currently utilized proliferation marker Ki67, as an independent prognostic marker for luminal A patients.The integration of chromatin regulators as clinical biomarkers, in particular the histone chaperone HJURP, will help guide patient substratification and treatment options for low-risk luminal A breast carcinoma patients.",

Cells employ autophagy as a critical compensatory survival mechanism during ER stress. This study utilised drug-induced ER stress through nelfinavir in order to examine ER stress tolerance in cell lines with hyper-active mTORC1 signalling. Our initial findings in wild type cells showed nelfinavir inhibited mTORC1 signalling and upregulated autophagy, as determined by decreased rpS6 and S6K1 phosphorylation, and SQTSM1 protein expression, respectively. Contrastingly, cells with hyper-active mTORC1 displayed basally elevated levels of ER stress which was greatly exaggerated following nelfinavir treatment, seen through increased CHOP mRNA and XBP1 splicing. To further enhance the effects of nelfinavir, we introduced chloroquine as an autophagy inhibitor. Combination of nelfinavir and chloroquine significantly increased ER stress and caused selective cell death in multiple cell line models with hyper-active mTORC1, whilst control cells with normalised mTORC1 signalling tolerated treatment. By comparing chloroquine to other autophagy inhibitors, we uncovered that selective toxicity invoked by chloroquine was independent of autophagy inhibition yet entrapment of chloroquine to acidified lysosomal/endosomal compartments was necessary for cytotoxicity. Our research demonstrates that combination of nelfinavir and chloroquine has therapeutic potential for treatment of mTORC1-driven tumours.",

Although a few studies have attempted to understand the relationship between obesity and melanoma, the consequences of controlling body weight by reducing adiposity on cancer progression is not well understood. By employing animal models of obesity, we report that controlling obesity either by orlistat treatment or by restricting caloric intake significantly slows down melanoma progression. The diminished tumor progression was correlated with decreased fat mass (adiposity) in obese mice. Obesity associated factors contributing to tumor progression were decreased in the experimental groups compared to respective controls. In tumors, protein levels of fatty acid synthase (FASN), caveolin (Cav)-1 and pAkt, which are tumor promoting molecules implicated in melanoma growth under obese state, were decreased. In addition, increased necrosis and reduction in angiogenesis as well as proliferative markers PCNA and cyclin D1 were observed in tumors of the orlistat treated and/or calorically restricted obese mice. We observed that growth of melanoma cells cultured in conditioned medium (CM) from orlistat-treated adipocytes was reduced. Adipokines (leptin and resistin), via activating Akt and modulation of FASN as well as Cav-1 respectively, enhanced melanoma cell growth and proliferation. Together, we demonstrate that controlling body weight reduces adipose mass thereby diminishing melanoma progression. Therefore, strategic means of controlling obesity by reduced caloric diet or with antiobesity drugs treatment may render obesity-promoted tumor progression in check and prolong survival of patients.",

The 9-microRNA risk score was validated in an independent dataset (p\u00a0=\u00a04.50e\u221202) and also stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups in lower grade glioma (p\u00a0=\u00a05.20e\u221203). The majority of the 9 microRNAs have been previously linked to glioblastoma biology or treatment response. Integration of the expression patterns of predicted microRNA targets revealed a number of relevant microRNA/target pairs, which were validated in cell lines.We have identified a novel, biologically relevant microRNA signature that stratifies high- and low-risk patients in glioblastoma. MicroRNA/mRNA interactions identified within the signature point to novel regulatory networks.

In this study, relative telomere length (RTL) in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) was measured using a real-time PCR-based method in a total of 693\u00a0GC patients receiving surgical resection. The prognostic value of leukocyte RTL was first explored in the training set (112 patients) using Kaplan\u2013Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Then an independent cohort of 581 patients was used as a validation set. To explore potential mechanism, we detected the immunophenotypes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma concentrations of several cytokines in GC patients. Patients with short RTL showed significantly worse overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) than those with long RTL in all patient sets. Furthermore, leukocyte RTL and TNM stage exhibited a notable joint effect in prognosis prediction. Integration of TNM stage and leukocyte RTL significantly improved the prognosis prediction efficacy for GC. In addition, we found that patients with short RTL had a higher CD4+ T cell percentage in PBMCs, CD19+IL-10+ Breg percentage in B cells and plasma IL-10 concentration, indicating an enhanced immunosuppressive status with short leukocyte RTL. In conclusion, our study for the first time demonstrates that leukocyte RTL is an independent prognostic marker complementing TNM stage and associated with an immunosuppressive phenotype in the peripheral blood lymphocytes in GC patients.",

In this model, the initial postirradiation cellular events in the thymus and bone marrow (BM) are critically important for tumorigenesis, and BM transplantation (BMT) prevents RITL. However, direct assessment of these events is so far restricted by the lack of noninvasive monitoring techniques. Here, we have developed positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods to quantify the events critical for RITL development and the effects of BMT in living animals. Apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were calculated from diffusion-weighted MRI to evaluate the changes in the BM of mice receiving FX. ADC values dramatically changed in the irradiated BM, corresponding to pathological findings of the irradiated BM, returning to normal levels following BMT sooner than with spontaneous recovery. PET with 4\u02b9-[methyl-11C]thiothymidine, a novel tracer for cell proliferation, revealed that the irradiated thymus showed significantly higher tracer uptake than the unirradiated thymus 1 week after FX. Interestingly, its increased uptake was completely abolished by BMT, even with very few donor-derived cells in the thymus. Thereafter, the thymus receiving BMT had significantly increased tracer uptake. These findings suggest that BMT first suppresses FX-induced aberrant thymocyte proliferation and then accelerates thymic regeneration. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using PET and MRI for noninvasive monitoring of tumorigenic cellular processes in an animal model of radiation-induced cancer.",

     "abstract": "EPHB3 is a critical cellular guidance factor in the intestinal epithelium and an important tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer (CRC) whose expression is frequently lost at the adenoma-carcinoma transition when tumor cells become invasive. The molecular mechanisms underlying EPHB3 silencing are incompletely understood. Here we show that EPHB3 expression is anti-correlated with inducers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in primary tumors and CRC cells. In\u00a0vitro, SNAIL1 and SNAIL2, but not ZEB1, repress EPHB3 reporter constructs and compete with the stem cell factor ASCL2 for binding to an E-box motif. At the endogenous EPHB3 locus, SNAIL1 triggers the displacement of ASCL2, p300 and the Wnt pathway effector TCF7L2 and engages corepressor complexes containing HDACs and the histone demethylase LSD1 to collapse active chromatin structure, resulting in rapid downregulation of EPHB3. Beyond its impact on EPHB3, SNAIL1 deregulates markers of intestinal identity and stemness and in\u00a0vitro forces CRC cells to undergo EMT with altered morphology, increased motility and invasiveness. In xenotransplants, SNAIL1 expression abrogated tumor cell palisading and led to focal loss of tumor encapsulation and the appearance of areas with tumor cells displaying a migratory phenotype. These changes were accompanied by loss of EPHB3 and CDH1 expression. Intriguingly, SNAIL1-induced phenotypic changes of CRC cells are significantly impaired by sustained EPHB3 expression both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Altogether, our results identify EPHB3 as a novel target of SNAIL1 and suggest that disabling EPHB3 signaling is an important aspect to eliminate a roadblock at the onset of EMT processes.",

To identify small molecules which selectively inhibit the growth of EBV or KSHV-associated B-cell lines, we performed a fluorescence based high-throughput screen on multiple stable GFP expressing virus-infected or uninfected B-cell lines. We identified 40 initial compounds with selective growth inhibition and subsequently determined the 50% growth inhibitory concentrations (GI50) for each drug. We further examined compounds with higher specificity to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms using transcription factor analysis, as well as a shRNA based knockdown strategy. Our data identified ten compounds with relatively high efficacy for growth inhibition. Two novel small molecules, NSC#10010 and NSC#65381 were potent growth inhibitors for gammaherpesvirus-associated B-lymphomas through activation of both the NF-\u03baB and c-Myc-mediated signaling pathways. These drugs can serve as potential lead compounds to expand the current therapeutic window against EBV or KSHV-associated human B-cell malignancies.",

However, the invasive response to TNF-\u03b1 relies on poorly understood molecular mechanisms. We thus investigated whether it involves the MET oncogene, which regulates the invasive growth program by encoding the tyrosine kinase receptor for Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF). Here we show that the TNF-\u03b1 pro-invasive activity requires MET function, as it is fully inhibited by MET-specific inhibitors (small-molecules, antibodies, and siRNAs). Mechanistically, we show that TNF-\u03b1 induces MET transcription via NF-\u03baB, and exploits MET to sustain MEK/ERK activation and Snail accumulation, leading to E-cadherin downregulation. We then show that TNF-\u03b1 not only induces MET expression in cancer cells, but also HGF secretion by fibroblasts. Consistently, we found that, in human colorectal cancer tissues, high levels of TNF-\u03b1 correlates with increased expression of both MET and HGF. These findings suggest that TNF-\u03b1 fosters a HGF/MET pro-invasive paracrine loop in tumors.

     "abstract": "Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and a subset of medulloblastomas are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, PTCH1. PTCH1 normally functions by repressing the activity of the Smoothened (SMO) receptor. Inactivating PTCH1 mutations result in constitutive Hedgehog pathway activity through uncontrolled SMO signaling. Targeting this pathway with vismodegib, a novel SMO inhibitor, results in impressive tumor regression in patients harboring genetic defects in this pathway. However, a secondary mutation in SMO has been reported in medulloblastoma patients following relapse on vismodegib to date. This mutation preserves pathway activity, but appears to confer resistance by interfering with drug binding.Here we report for the first time on the molecular mechanisms of resistance to vismodegib in two BCC cases. The first case, showing progression after 2 months of continuous vismodegib (primary resistance), exhibited the new SMO G497W mutation. The second case, showing a complete clinical response after 5 months of treatment and a subsequent progression after 11 months on vismodegib (secondary resistance), exhibited a PTCH1 nonsense mutation in both the pre- and the post-treatment specimens, and the SMO D473Y mutation in the post-treatment specimens only. In silico analysis demonstrated that SMOG497W undergoes a conformational rearrangement resulting in a partial obstruction of the protein drug entry site, whereas the SMO D473Y mutation induces a direct effect on the binding site geometry leading to a total disruption of a stabilizing hydrogen bond network. Thus, the G497W and D473Y SMO mutations may represent two different mechanisms leading to primary and secondary resistance to vismodegib, respectively.",

Nonetheless, improving therapeutic efficacy and patient survival is important, particularly in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. Here, we describe the development of 1E11, a HER2-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody showing increased efficacy in a highly synergistic manner in combination with trastuzumab in the HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines NCI-N87 and OE-19. The two antibodies bind to sub-domain IV of the receptor, but have non-overlapping epitopes, allowing them to simultaneously bind HER2. Treatment with 1E11 alone induced apoptosis in HER2-positive cancer cells, and this effect was enhanced by combination treatment with trastuzumab. Combination treatment with 1E11 and trastuzumab reduced the levels of total HER2 protein and those of aberrant HER2 signaling molecules including phosphorylated HER3 and EGFR. The synergistic antitumor activity of 1E11 in combination with trastuzumab indicates that it could be a novel potent therapeutic antibody for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing gastric cancers.",

Overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and/or Mcl-1 has been associated with chemoresistance in AML cell lines and with poor clinical outcome of AML patients. Thus, inhibitors of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins could be novel therapeutic agents. In this study, we investigated how clinically achievable concentrations of obatoclax, a pan-Bcl-2 inhibitor, potentiate the antileukemic activity of cytarabine in AML cells. MTT assays in AML cell lines and diagnostic blasts, as well as flow cytometry analyses in AML cell lines revealed synergistic antileukemic activity between cytarabine and obatoclax. Bax activation was detected in the combined, but not the individual, drug treatments. This was accompanied by significantly increased loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Most importantly, in AML cells treated with the combination, enhanced early induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) preceded a decrease of Mcl-1 levels, nuclear translocation of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, and apoptosis. These results indicate that obatoclax enhances cytarabine-induced apoptosis by enhancing DNA DSBs. This novel mechanism provides compelling evidence for the clinical use of BH3 mimetics in combination with DNA-damaging agents in AML and possibly a broader range of malignancies.",

Thus, identification of novel prognostic and predictive biomarkers is urgently needed. We have used 42 paraffin-embedded HGSOCs, to evaluate the utility of DNA copy number alterations, as potential predictors of clinical outcome. Copy number-based unsupervised clustering stratified HGSOCs into two clusters of different immunohistopathological features and survival outcome (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.15, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.03\u20130.81; Padj\u00a0=\u00a00.03). We found that loss at 6q24.2\u201326 was significantly associated with the cluster of longer survival independently from other confounding factors (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.06, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.01\u20130.43, Padj\u00a0=\u00a00.005). The prognostic value of this deletion was validated in two independent series, one consisting of 36 HGSOCs analyzed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and another comprised of 411 HGSOCs from the Cancer Genome Atlas study (TCGA) (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.67, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.48\u20130.93, Padj\u00a0=\u00a00.019). In addition, we confirmed the association of low expression of the genes from the region with longer survival in 799 HGSOCs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.74, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.61\u20130.90, log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and 675 high-FIGO stage HGSOCs (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.61\u20130.96, log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) available from the online tool KM-plotter. Finally, by integrating copy number, RNAseq and survival data of 296 HGSOCs from TCGA we propose a few candidate genes that can potentially explain the association. Altogether our findings indicate that the 6q24.2\u201326 deletion is an independent marker of favorable outcome in HGSOCs with potential clinical value as it can be analyzed by FISH on tumor sections and guide the selection of patients towards more conservative therapeutic strategies in order to reduce side-effects and improve quality of life.",

Here, we investigated the cellular effects of SSX2 expression. In A375 melanoma cells, SSX2 expression resulted in an increased DNA content and enlargement of cell nuclei, suggestive of replication aberrations. The cells further displayed signs of DNA damage and genomic instability, associated with p53-mediated G1 cell cycle arrest and a late apoptotic response. These results suggest a model wherein SSX2-mediated replication stress translates into mitotic defects and genomic instability. Arrest of cell growth and induction of DNA double-strand breaks was also observed in MCF7 breast cancer cells in response to SSX2 expression. Additionally, MCF7 cells with ectopic SSX2 expression demonstrated typical signs of senescence (i.e. an irregular and enlarged cell shape, enhanced \u03b2-galactosidase activity and DNA double-strand breaks). Since replication defects, DNA damage and senescence are interconnected and well-documented effects of oncogene expression, we tested the oncogenic potential of SSX2. Importantly, knockdown of SSX2 expression in melanoma cell lines demonstrated that SSX2 supports the growth of melanoma cells. Our results reveal two important phenotypes of ectopic SSX2 expression that may drive/support tumorigenesis: First, immediate induction of genomic instability, and second, long-term support of tumor cell growth.",

     "abstract": "A significant association between DNA losses on 22q13.31 and head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) was previously reported by our group. Our data indicated that PHF21B gene, mapped on 22q13.31 and encoding a protein with function of chromatin-mediated transcriptional regulation, might be a putative tumor suppressor gene. To test this hypothesis, gene copy number was assessed in 75 HNSCC and 49 matched peripheral blood samples. PHF21B losses were detected in 43 tumors and were significantly associated with patients with familial history of cancer (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001); i.e., 36/43 cases showed a positive family history of cancer and 22/36 had first-degree relatives with cancer (P\u00a0=\u00a00.049). In attempt to investigate other mechanisms for PHF21B loss of function, DNA sequencing was performed and no mutations were detected. We next evaluated the gene expression levels after inhibition of DNA methylation in nine HNSCC and breast carcinoma cell lines. Additionally, PHF21B expression levels were evaluated in colon cancer HCT116 cells as well as in its counterpart DKO (double knockout of DNMT1 and DNMT3B). The higher expression levels of PHF21B gene detected in DKO cells were inversely correlated with the DNA methylation. Further, DNA methylation in the specific promoter-associated CpG Island was investigated. Interestingly, gene hypermethylation was detected in 13/37 tumors: 5/13 HNSCC cases had family history of cancer in first-degree relatives and 8/13 showed both, DNA methylation and PHF21B losses in the tumor sample. One patient had PHF21B loss in the peripheral blood cells and PHF21B methylation in the tumor sample. Additionally, overexpression of PHF21B in cell lines drastically reduces clonogenic and migratory abilities. These data suggest that PHF21B is a novel tumor suppressor gene that can be inactivated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in the human cancer.",

The effect of cell cycle phase, ATR knockdown and inhibition on these phosphorylation events was determined.Hydroxyurea, UV and 4NQO induced Chk1 and H2AX phosphorylation in MCF7 and K562 cells. UV/4NQO activation of ATR was detectable in non-cycling cells. Chk1 phosphorylation was reduced by ATR knockdown and reflects ATR activity for 3\u00a0h, H2AX phosphorylation after UV/4NQO is ATR-dependent for 1\u00a0h\u00a0but increasingly ATM and DNA-PK-dependent at later time points.

Importantly, ATR activity is detectable in non-cycling PBMCs allowing them to be used as a surrogate tissue for biomarker measurement.

This led to the identification of a miRNA signature for aggressive breast cancer, and to the characterization of novel roles of selected miRNAs in cancer-related biological phenotypes. Unexpectedly, in a number of cases, expression regulation of the intronic-miRNA was more relevant than the expression of their host gene.

     "abstract": "Traditional antimitotic drugs for cancer chemotherapy often have undesired toxicities to healthy tissues, limiting their clinical application. Developing novel agents that specifically target tumor cell mitosis is needed to minimize the toxicity and improve the efficacy of this class of anticancer drugs. We discovered that mdivi-1 (mitochondrial division inhibitor-1), which was originally reported as an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission protein Drp1, specifically disrupts M phase cell cycle progression only in human tumor cells, but not in non-transformed fibroblasts or epithelial cells. The antimitotic effect of mdivi-1 is Drp1 independent, as mdivi-1 induces M phase abnormalities in both Drp1 wild-type and Drp1 knockout SV40-immortalized/transformed MEF cells. We also identified that the tumor transformation process required for the antimitotic effect of mdivi-1 is downstream of SV40 large T and small t antigens, but not hTERT-mediated immortalization. Mdivi-1 induces multipolar mitotic spindles in tumor cells regardless of their centrosome numbers. Acentrosomal spindle poles, which do not contain the bona-fide centrosome components \u03b3-tubulin and centrin-2, were found to contribute to the spindle multipolarity induced by mdivi-1. Gene expression profiling revealed that the genes involved in oocyte meiosis and assembly of acentrosomal microtubules are highly expressed in tumor cells. We further identified that tumor cells have enhanced activity in the nucleation and assembly of acentrosomal kinetochore-attaching microtubules. Mdivi-1 inhibited the integration of acentrosomal microtubule-organizing centers into centrosomal asters, resulting in the development of acentrosomal mitotic spindles preferentially in tumor cells. The formation of multipolar acentrosomal spindles leads to gross genome instability and Bax/Bak-dependent apoptosis. Taken together, our studies indicate that inducing multipolar spindles composing of acentrosomal poles in mitosis could achieve tumor-specific antimitotic effect, and mdivi-1 thus represents a novel class of compounds as acentrosomal spindle inducers (ASI).",

In these cells, amphiregulin (AREG)-mediated activation of EGFR results in up-regulation of fibronectin (FN1), which is known to be a mediator of invasive capacity via interaction with integrin \u03b21.

     "abstract": "Cancer is a multifactorial and heterogeneous disease. The corresponding complexity appears at multiple levels: from the molecular and the cellular constitution to the macroscopic phenotype, and at the diagnostic and therapeutic management stages. The overall complexity can be approximated to a certain extent, e.g. characterized by a set of quantitative phenotypic observables recorded in time-space resolved dimensions by using multimodal imaging approaches. The transition from measures to data can be made effective through various computational inference methods, including networks, which are inherently capable of mapping variables and data to node- and/or edge-valued topological properties, dynamic modularity configurations, and functional motifs. We illustrate how networks can integrate imaging data to explain cancer complexity, and assess potential pre-clinical and clinical impact.",

     "abstract": "Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) 1A enzymes produce retinoic acid (RA), a transcription induction molecule. To investigate if ALDH1A1 or ALDH1A3-mediated RA signaling has an active role in breast cancer tumorigenesis, we performed gene expression and tumor xenograft studies. Analysis of breast patient tumors revealed that high levels of ALDH1A3 correlated with expression of RA-inducible genes with retinoic acid response elements (RAREs), poorer patient survival and triple-negative breast cancers. This suggests a potential link between ALDH1A3 expression and RA signaling especially in aggressive and/or triple-negative breast cancers. In MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-435 cells, ALDH1A3 and RA increased expression of RA-inducible genes. Interestingly, ALDH1A3 had opposing effects in tumor xenografts, increasing tumor growth and metastasis of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cells, but decreasing tumor growth of MDA-MB-468 cells. Exogenous RA replaced ALDH1A3 in inducing the same opposing tumor growth and metastasis effects, suggesting that ALDH1A3 mediates these effects by promoting RA signaling. Genome expression analysis revealed that ALDH1A3 induced largely divergent gene expression in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells which likely resulted in the opposing tumor growth effects. Treatment with DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine restored uniform RA-inducibility of RARE-containing HOXA1 and MUC4 in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, suggesting that differences in epigenetic modifications contribute to differential ALDH1A3/RA-induced gene expression in breast cancer. In summary, ALDH1A3 induces differential RA signaling in breast cancer cells which affects the rate of breast cancer progression.",

Last decade, gene expression based-classifications have been developed in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) to identify distinct subtypes of disease and predict patient's outcome. However, there are no current lncRNA comprehensive characterizations in ccRCC.RNA-sequencing profiles of 475 primary ccRCC samples from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were used to assess expressed lncRNA and identify lncRNA-based classification. In addition, integrative analysis was performed to correlate tumor subtypes with copy-number alterations and somatic mutations.Using stringent criteria, we identified 1934 expressed lncRNA and assessed their chromatin marks. Unsupervised clustering unravels four lncRNA subclasses in ccRCC associated with distinct clinicopathological and genomic features of this disease. Cluster C2 (23.4%) defines the most aggressive tumours, with the highest Fuhrman grade and stage and the worst overall survival time. Furthermore, cluster C2 is enriched for 9p deletion and chromatin remodeler BAP1 somatic mutations. Interestingly, cluster C4 (7.8%) is related to a tumor subtype arising from the distal tubules of the nephron. Consistent with its distinct ontogeny, cluster C4 is devoid of classical alterations seen in ccRCC, bears frequent 1p deletion and 17q gain, and is enriched for MiTF/TFE translocations. In addition, reexaminations of copy-number data from one side and tumor histology by pathologists from the other side reveal misclassified tumors within C4 cluster including chromophobe RCC and clear cell papillary RCC.This study establishes a foundation for categorizing lncRNA subclasses, which may contribute to understand tumor ontogeny and help predicting patients' outcome in ccRCC.",

     "abstract": "Early clinical studies suggested infiltrating T cells might be associated with poor outcomes in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. The detailed mechanisms how T cells contribute to PCa progression, however, remained unclear. Here, we found PCa cells have a better capacity to recruit more CD4(+) T cells than the surrounding normal prostate cells via secreting more chemokines-CXCL9. The consequences of more recruited CD4(+) T cells to PCa might then lead to enhance PCa cell invasion. Mechanism dissection revealed that infiltrating CD4(+) T cells might function through the modulation of FGF11\u2192miRNA-541 signals to suppress PCa androgen receptor (AR) signals. The suppressed AR signals might then alter the MMP9 signals to promote the PCa cell invasion. Importantly, suppressed AR signals via AR-siRNA or anti-androgen Enzalutamide in PCa cells also enhanced the recruitment of T cells and the consequences of this positive feed back regulation could then enhance the PCa cell invasion. Targeting these newly identified signals via FGF11-siRNA, miRNA-541 inhibitor or MMP9 inhibitor all led to partially reverse the enhanced PCa cell invasion. Results from in\u00a0vivo mouse models also confirmed the in\u00a0vitro cell lines in co-culture studies. Together, these results concluded that infiltrating CD4(+) T cells could promote PCa metastasis via modulation of FGF11\u2192miRNA-541\u2192AR\u2192MMP9 signaling. Targeting these newly identified signals may provide us a new potential therapeutic approach to better battle PCa metastasis.",

In the current study we performed subtype specific analyses of ASAH1 gene expression in invasive and non invasive breast cancer. We show that expression of ASAH1 is mainly associated with luminal A \u2013 like cancers which are known to have the best prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes. Moreover tumors with high ASAH1 expression among the other subtypes are also characterized by an improved prognosis. The good prognosis of tumors with high ASAH1 is independent of the type of adjuvant treatment in breast cancer and is also detected in non small cell lung cancer patients. Moreover, even in pre-invasive DCIS of the breast ASAH1 is associated with a luminal phenotype and a reduced frequency of recurrences. Thus, high ASAH1 expression is generally associated with an improved prognosis in invasive breast cancer independent of adjuvant treatment and could also be valuable as prognostic factor for pre-invasive DCIS.",

Hence, efforts have been made towards establishing new diagnostic tools. Molecular profiling is a promising diagnostic approach, but tissue heterogeneity and inadequacy may negatively affect the accuracy and usability of molecular classifiers. We have developed and validated a microRNA-based classifier, which predicts the primary tumor site of liver biopsies, containing a limited number of tumor cells. Concurrently we explored the influence of surrounding normal tissue on classification. MicroRNA profiling was performed using quantitative Real-Time PCR on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples. 278 primary tumors and liver metastases, representing nine primary tumor classes, as well as normal liver samples were used as a training set. A statistical model was applied to adjust for normal liver tissue contamination. Performance was estimated by cross-validation, followed by independent validation on 55 liver core biopsies with a tumor content as low as 10%. A microRNA classifier developed, using the statistical contamination model, showed an overall classification accuracy of 74.5% upon independent validation. Two-thirds of the samples were classified with high-confidence, with an accuracy of 92% on high-confidence predictions. A classifier trained without adjusting for liver tissue contamination, showed a classification accuracy of 38.2%. Our results indicate that surrounding normal tissue from the biopsy site may critically influence molecular classification. A significant improvement in classification accuracy was obtained when the influence of normal tissue was limited by application of a statistical contamination model.",

We have previously shown that the oncolytic adenovirus dl922-947 induces extensive DNA damage, therefore we hypothesized a synergistic antitumoral effect of the PARP inhibitor olaparib in association with dl922-947. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma was chosen as model since it is a particularly aggressive tumor and, because of its localized growth, it is suitable for intratumoral treatment with oncolytic viruses.Here, we show that dl922-947 infection induces PARP activation, and we confirm in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo that PARP inhibition increases dl922-947 replication and oncolytic activity. In\u00a0vitro, the combination with olaparib exacerbates the appearance of cell death markers, such as Annexin V positivity, caspase 3 cleavage, cytochrome C release and propidium iodide permeability. In\u00a0vivo, we also observed a better viral distribution upon PARP inhibition. Changes in CD31 levels suggest a direct effect of olaparib on tumor vascularization and on the viral distribution within the tumor mass. The observation that PARP inhibition enhances the effects of dl922-947 is highly promising not only for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma but, in general, for the treatment of other tumors that could benefit from the use of oncolytic viruses.",

     "abstract": "Background: The existence of a dichotomy between immunologically active and quiescent tumor phenotypes has been recently recognized in several types of cancer. The activation of a Th1 type of immune signature has been shown to confer better prognosis and likelihood to respond to immunotherapy. However, whether such dichotomy depends on the genetic make-up of individual cancers is not known yet. BRAF and NRAS mutations are commonly acquired during melanoma progression. Here we explored the role of BRAF and NRAS mutations in influencing the immune phenotype based on a classification previously identified by our group.One-hundred-thirteen melanoma metastases underwent microarray analysis and BRAF and NRAS genotyping. Allele-specific PCR was also performed in order to exclude low-frequency mutations.Comparison between BRAF and NRAS mutant versus wild type samples identified mostly constituents or regulators of MAPK and related pathways. When testing gene lists discriminative of BRAF, NRAS and MAPK alterations, we found that 112 BRAF-specific transcripts were able to distinguish the two immune-related phenotypes already described in melanoma, with the poor phenotype associated mostly with BRAF mutation. Noteworthy, such association was stronger in samples displaying low BRAF mRNA expression. However, when testing NRAS mutations, we were not able to find the same association.This study suggests that BRAF mutation-related specific transcripts associate with a poor phenotype in melanoma and provide a nest for further investigation.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal human cancers, and radiotherapy is often implemented for locally advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Tumor cell repopulation is a major challenge in treating cancers after radiotherapy. In order to address the problem of tumor repopulation, our previous studies have demonstrated that dying cells stimulate the proliferation of living tumor cells after radiotherapy. In particular, dying cells undergoing apoptosis also activate survival or proliferation signals and release growth factors to surrounding living cells. In the present study, we used an in\u00a0vitro model to examine the possible mechanisms for dying cell stimulated tumor repopulation in pancreatic cancer. In this model, a small number of living, luciferase-labeled pancreatic cancer cells (reporter) were seeded onto a layer of a much larger number of irradiated, unlabeled pancreatic cancer cells and the growth of the living cells was measured over time as a gage of tumor repopulation. Our results indicate that irradiated, dying Panc1 feeder cells significantly stimulated the proliferation of living Panc1 reporter cells. Importantly, we identified that the percentage of apoptotic cells and the cleavage of caspases 3 and 7 and protein kinase C\u03b4 (PKC\u03b4) were increased in irradiated Panc1 cells. We presumed that caspases 3 and 7 and PKC\u03b4 as integral mediators in the process of dying pancreatic cancer cell stimulation of living tumor cell growth. In order to demonstrate the importance of caspases 3, 7 and PKC\u03b4, we introduced dominant-negative mutants of caspase 3 (DN_C3), caspase 7 (DN_C7), or PKC\u03b4 (DN_PKC\u03b4) into Panc1 cells using lentiviral vectors. The stably transduced Panc1 cells were irradiated and used as feeders and we found a significant decrease in the growth of living Panc1 reporter cells when compared with irradiated wild-type Panc1 cells as feeders. Moreover, the role of PKC\u03b4 in the growth stimulation of living tumor cells was further confirmed using a pan PKC inhibitor GF109203x and a specific PKC\u03b4 inhibitor, rottlerin. Additionally, we found significantly increased phosphorylation of Akt, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK1/2) in the irradiated Panc1 cells. Mechanistically, PKC\u03b4 cleavage was attenuated in both DN_C3 and DN_C7 transduced Panc1 cells, and both Akt and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were attenuated in DN_PKC\u03b4 transduced Panc1 cells following radiation. Thus, this report suggests a novel finding that cellular signaling caspase 3/7-PKC\u03b4-Akt/p38 MAPK is crucial to the repopulation in Panc1 cells after radiotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Complex focal chromosomal rearrangements in cancer genomes, also called \u201cfirestorms\u201d, can be scored from DNA copy number data. The complex arm-wise aberration index (CAAI) is a score that captures DNA copy number alterations that appear as focal complex events in tumors, and has potential prognostic value in breast cancer. This study aimed to validate this DNA-based prognostic index in breast cancer and test for the first time its potential prognostic value in ovarian cancer. Copy number alteration (CNA) data from 1950 breast carcinomas (METABRIC cohort) and 508 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas (TCGA dataset) were analyzed. Cases were classified as CAAI positive if at least one complex focal event was scored. Complex alterations were frequently localized on chromosome 8p (n\u00a0=\u00a0159), 17q (n\u00a0=\u00a0176) and 11q (n\u00a0=\u00a0251). CAAI events on 11q were most frequent in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) cases and on 17q in estrogen receptor negative (ER\u2212) cases. We found only a modest correlation between CAAI and the overall rate of genomic instability (GII) and number of breakpoints (r\u00a0=\u00a00.27 and r\u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Breast cancer specific survival (BCSS), overall survival (OS) and ovarian cancer progression free survival (PFS) were used as clinical end points in Cox proportional hazard model survival analyses. CAAI positive breast cancers (43%) had higher mortality: hazard ratio (HR) of 1.94 (95%CI, 1.62\u20132.32) for BCSS, and of 1.49 (95%CI, 1.30\u20131.71) for OS. Representations of the 70-gene and the 21-gene predictors were compared with CAAI in multivariable models and CAAI was independently significant with a Cox adjusted HR of 1.56 (95%CI, 1.23\u20131.99) for ER+ and 1.55 (95%CI, 1.11\u20132.18) for ER\u2212 disease. None of the expression-based predictors were prognostic in the ER\u2212 subset. We found that a model including CAAI and the two expression-based prognostic signatures outperformed a model including the 21-gene and 70-gene signatures but excluding CAAI. Inclusion of CAAI in the clinical prognostication tool PREDICT significantly improved its performance. CAAI positive ovarian cancers (52%) also had worse prognosis: HRs of 1.3 (95%CI, 1.1\u20131.7) for PFS and 1.3 (95%CI, 1.1\u20131.6) for OS. This study validates CAAI as an independent predictor of survival in both ER+ and ER\u2212 breast cancer and reveals a significant prognostic value for CAAI in high-grade serous ovarian cancer.",

Multivariate statistics and a Random Forest classifier were used to create a prognostic model for disease relapse in early patients.Results: In the early breast cancer training set (n\u00a0=\u00a040), metabolomics correctly distinguished between early and metastatic disease in 83.7% of cases. A prognostic risk model predicted relapse with 90% sensitivity (95% CI 74.9\u201394.8%), 67% specificity (95% CI 63.0\u201373.4%) and 73% predictive accuracy (95% CI 70.6\u201374.8%). These results were reproduced in an independent early breast cancer set (n\u00a0=\u00a040), with 82% sensitivity, 72% specificity and 75% predictive accuracy. Disease relapse was associated with significantly lower levels of histidine (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003) and higher levels of glucose (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and lipids (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003), compared with patients with no relapse.Conclusions: The performance of a serum metabolomic prognostic model for disease relapse in individuals with ER-negative early stage breast cancer is promising.

     "abstract": "Exposure to drugs that interfere with microtubule dynamics block cell cycle progression at mitosis by prolonged activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Cells can evade mitotic arrest and proceed to interphase without chromosome segregation by a process termed mitotic slippage that involves Cyclin B1 degradation without checkpoint inactivation. Here, we explored the cellular response to small-molecule inhibitors of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), an important regulator of cell division. We found that the clinical Plk1 inhibitors BI 2536 and BI 6727, both unexpectedly, induced a dose-dependent cellular drug response: While mitotic arrest was induced in cancer cell lines and primary non-transformed cells across the entire range of concentrations tested, only high concentrations seemed to promote mitotic slippage. Since this observation contrasts with the effects expected from studies reporting RNAi-mediated Plk1 depletion in cancer cells, we wondered whether both ATP-competitive inhibitors target unknown kinases that are involved in signaling from the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and might contribute to the mitotic slippage. A chemical proteomics approach used to profile the selectivity of both inhibitors revealed that SAC kinases are not targeted directly. Still, the activities of Cdk1/Cyclin B1 and Aurora B, which plays important roles in the error correction of false microtubule-kinetochore attachments and in checkpoint signaling, were shown to be downregulated at high inhibitor concentrations. Our data suggest that the inhibition of Plk1 activity below a certain threshold influences Aurora B activity via reduced phosphorylation of Fox M1 and Survivin leading to diminished levels of Aurora B protein and alteration of its subcellular localization. Within the spectrum of SAC proteins that are degraded during mitotic slippage, the degradation of Cyclin B1 and the downregulation of Aurora B activity by Plk1 inhibition seem to be critical promoters of mitotic slippage. The results indicate that careful dose-finding studies in cancer trials are necessary to limit or even prevent mitotic slippage, which could be associated with improved cancer cell survival.",

Even though tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are known mediators of these processes, little is known regarding their miRNA expression upon education by malignant cells in\u00a0vivo.We profiled miRNA and mRNA expression of in\u00a0vitro tumor-educated macrophages (TEM) by indirectly co-culturing with estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The prognostic power of the resulting miRNA list was investigated in primary breast cancer datasets and compared to other signatures. Furthermore, miRNA expression levels were correlated to mRNA expression of macrophage markers and the impact on prognosis was assessed.Through the evaluation of the group effects between differentially-expressed miRNAs and their target mRNAs in TEM, the power of detecting regulated miRNAs was greatly increased. The resulting list of 96 miRNAs predicts disease-free survival (DFS) in external datasets of ER+ breast cancer patients and performs well in comparison with other miRNA signatures. Clustering with the predefined miRNA list revealed a significant difference in survival between the two resulting patient groups. Furthermore, an optimized miRNA list, based on correlations with macrophages markers, proved even more capable at identifying patient clusters significantly differing in DFS.In\u00a0vitro profiling of TEM and subsequent bioinformatic verification identified miRNAs with a high prognostic power for DFS when transferred into the clinical setting of primary breast cancer. The resulting miRNAs not only verify previously established findings but also lead to new prognostic markers.

     "abstract": "The angiogenic capability of colorectal carcinomas (CRC), and their susceptibility to anti-angiogenic therapy, is determined by expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms. The intracellular protein T-cell Intracellular Antigen (TIA-1) alters post-transcriptional RNA processing and binds VEGF-A mRNA. We therefore tested the hypothesis that TIA-1 could regulate VEGF-A isoform expression in colorectal cancers. TIA-1 and VEGF-A isoform expression was measured in colorectal cancers and cell lines. We discovered that an endogenous splice variant of TIA-1 encoding a truncated protein, short TIA-1 (sTIA-1) was expressed in CRC tissues and invasive K-Ras mutant colon cancer cells and tissues but not in adenoma cell lines. sTIA-1 was more highly expressed in CRC than in normal tissues and increased with tumour stage. Knockdown of sTIA-1 or over-expression of full length TIA-1 (flTIA-1) induced expression of the anti-angiogenic VEGF isoform VEGF-A165b. Whereas flTIA-1 selectively bound VEGF-A165 mRNA and increased translation of VEGF-A165b, sTIA-1 prevented this binding. In nude mice, xenografted colon cancer cells over-expressing flTIA-1 formed smaller, less vascular tumours than those expressing sTIA-1, but flTIA-1 expression inhibited the effect of anti-VEGF antibodies. These results indicate that alternative splicing of an RNA binding protein can regulate isoform specific expression of VEGF providing an added layer of complexity to the angiogenic profile of colorectal cancer and their resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy.",

BMP activity has been linked to both tumor promoting and suppressive functions in both tumor cells and their surrounding microenvironment. We sought to investigate the requirement for BMPR2 in stromal fibroblasts during mammary tumor formation and metastasis. We utilized FSP1 (Fibroblast Specific Protein-1) promoter driven Cre to genetically delete BMPR2 in mice expressing the MMTV.PyVmT mammary carcinoma oncogene. We found that abrogation of stromal BMPR2 expression via FSP1 driven Cre resulted in increased tumor metastasis. Additionally, similar to epithelial BMPR2 abrogation, stromal loss of BMPR2 results in increased inflammatory cell infiltration. We proceeded to isolate and establish fibroblast cell lines without BMPR2 and found a cell autonomous increase in inflammatory cytokine secretion. Fibroblasts were co-implanted with syngeneic tumor cells and resulted in accelerated tumor growth and increased metastasis when fibroblasts lacked BMPR2. We observed that the loss of BMPR2 results in increased chemokine expression, which facilitates inflammation by a sustained increase in myeloid cells. The chemokines increased in BMPR2 deleted cells correlated with poor outcome in human breast cancer patients. We conclude that BMPR2 has tumor suppressive functions in the stroma by regulating inflammation.",

It is hypothesised that GBM CSCs exhibit upregulated DNA damage responses and are resistant to radiation but the current literature is conflicting. We investigated radioresistance of primary GBM cells grown in stem cell conditions (CSC) compared to paired differentiated tumour cell populations and explored the radiosensitising effects of the ATM inhibitor KU-55933.We report that GBM CSCs are radioresistant compared to paired differentiated tumour cells as measured by clonogenic assay. GBM CSC's display upregulated phosphorylated DNA damage response proteins and enhanced activation of the G2/M checkpoint following irradiation and repair DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) more efficiently than their differentiated tumour cell counterparts following radiation.Inhibition of ATM kinase by KU-55933 produced potent radiosensitisation of GBM CSCs (sensitiser enhancement ratios 2.6\u20133.5) and effectively abrogated the enhanced DSB repair proficiency observed in GBM CSCs at 24\u00a0h post irradiation. G2/M checkpoint activation was reduced but not abolished by KU-55933 in GBM CSCs.ATM kinase inhibition overcomes radioresistance of GBM CSCs and, in combination with conventional therapy, has potential to improve outcomes for patients with GBM.",

In human tumours, BRCA1 negativity was strongly associated with low XRCC1, and low pol \u03b2 at mRNA and protein levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). In patients with BRCA1 negative tumours, low XRCC1 or low pol \u03b2 expression was significantly associated with poor survival in univariate and multivariate analysis compared to high XRCC1 or high pol \u03b2 expressing BRCA1 negative tumours (ps\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

     "abstract": "Deficiency of the tumour suppressor merlin leads to the development of schwannomas, meningiomas and ependymomas occurring spontaneously or as a part of the hereditary disease Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). Merlin loss is also found in a proportion of other cancers like mesothelioma, melanoma, breast cancer and glioblastoma. The tumour suppressor/transcription factor p53 regulates proliferation, survival and differentiation and its deficiency plays a role in the development of many tumours. 53 can be negatively regulated by FAK, PI3K/AKT and MDM2 and possibly positively regulated by merlin in different cell lines. In this study we investigated the role of p53 in merlin-deficient tumours. Using our in\u00a0vitro model of primary human schwannoma cells we have previously demonstrated that FAK is overexpressed/activated and localises into the nucleus of schwannoma cells increasing proliferation. AKT is strongly activated via platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) \u2013 and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) \u2013 receptors increasing survival. Here we investigated p53 regulation and its role in proliferation and survival of human primary schwannoma cells using western blotting, immunocytochemistry, immunohistochemistry and proliferation, survival and transcription factor assays. In human primary schwannoma cells p53 was found to be downregulated while MDM2 was upregulated leading to increased cell proliferation and survival. p53 is regulated by merlin involving FAK, AKT and MDM2. Merlin reintroduction into schwannoma cells increased p53 levels and activity, and treatment with Nutlin-3, a drug which increases p53 stability by disrupting the p53/MDM2 complex, decreased tumour growth and reduced cell survival. These findings are important to dissect the mechanisms responsible for the development of merlin-deficient tumours and to identify new therapeutic targets. We suggest that Nutlin-3, possibly in combination with FAK or PI3K inhibitors, can be employed as a novel treatment for schwannoma and other merlin-deficient tumours.",

The overexpression of Aurora-A has been observed to associate with the grades of differentiation, invasive capability and distant lymph node metastasis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, the molecular mechanism by which Aurora-A promotes malignant development of ESCC is still largely unknown. In this study, we show that Aurora-A overexpression enhances tumor cell invasion and metastatic potential in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Furthermore, Aurora-A overexpression inhibits the degradation of \u03b2-catenin, promotes its dissociation from cell\u2013cell contacts and increases its nuclear translocation. We also demonstrate for the first time that Aurora-A directly interacts with \u03b2-catenin and phosphorylates \u03b2-catenin at Ser552 and Ser675. Substitutions of serine residue with alanine at single or both positions substantially attenuate Aurora-A-mediated stabilization of \u03b2-catenin, abolish its cytosolic and nuclear localization as well as transcriptional activity. In addition, Aurora-A overexpression is significantly correlated with increased cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin expression in ESCC tissues.

We aimed to compare the activity of tivantinib to established MET TKIs in a panel of NSCLC cell lines characterized by their MET dependency and by different relevant genotypes. A549, H3122, PC9 and HCC827, their respective resistant clones PC9 GR4 and HCC827 GR6 and the MET amplified cell lines H1993 and EBC-1 were treated in\u00a0vitro with tivantinib, crizotinib or PHA-665752. Crizotinib and PHA-665752 showed growth inhibition restricted to MET dependent cell lines. The pattern of activity was related to MET inhibition and downstream signaling inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2, resulting in G0/G1 cycle arrest and apoptosis. In contrast, tivantinib possessed more potent anti-proliferative activity that was not restricted to only MET dependent cell lines. Tivantinib did not inhibit cellular MET activity or phosphorylation of downstream signaling proteins AKT or ERK1/2 in either MET dependent or independent cell lines. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that tivantinib induced a G2/M arrest and induced apoptosis. Tivantinib but not crizotinib effected microtubule dynamics, disrupting mitotic spindles by a mechanism consistent with it functioning as a microtubule depolymerizer. Tivantinib activity is independent of MET signaling in NSCLC and suggests alternative mechanisms of action that should be considered when interpreting the results from on-going clinical studies.",

At early diagnosis, only distinct groups, such as HER2-or hormone receptor-positive benefit from a targeted therapy. However, a part of these tumours develops resistance within a year of administration of the drug but the majority of the patients depends on general therapies with severe side effects. A PTK6-directed approach does not yet exist.In our present study, we successfully demonstrate, in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, a significantly additive reduction of tumourigenesis of breast cancer cells simultaneously depleted of both HER2 and PTK6. In comparison with single RNAi approaches, the combined RNAi (co-RNAi) led to a stronger reduced phosphorylation of tumour-promoting proteins. Moreover, the co-RNAi additively decreased cell migration as well as two and three dimensional cell proliferation in\u00a0vitro. The in\u00a0vivo experiments showed an additive reduction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.00001) in the growth of xenografts due to the co-RNAi compared with HER2 or PTK6 RNAi alone. Interestingly, the complexes of HER2 or PTK6 with tumour-relevant interaction partners, such as HER3 or the insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGF-1R), respectively, were also reduced in xenografts although their protein expression levels were not affected following the co-RNAi of HER2 and PTK6. Our present study reveals the potential of using combined HER2- and PTK6- knockdown as a powerful strategy for the treatment of breast cancers. Therefore, the combined inhibition of these proteins may represent an attractive tool for efficient therapy of breast cancers.",

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer is an androgen receptor (AR)-dependent malignancy at initiation and progression, therefore hormone therapy is the primary line of systemic treatment. Despite initial disease regression, tumours inevitably recur and progress to an advanced castration-resistant state a major feature of which is metastasis to the bone. Up-regulation of AR cofactors and chaperones that overcome low hormone conditions to maintain basal AR activity has been postulated as a mechanism of therapy relapse.p23, an essential component of the apo-AR complex, acts also after ligand binding to increase AR transcriptional activity and target gene expression, partly by increasing chromatin-loaded holo-receptor-complexes. Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated increased p23 expression in advanced prostate cancer. Here, we further characterise p23 roles in AR signalling and show that it modulates cytosolic AR levels in the absence of hormone, confirming a chaperoning function in the aporeceptor complex and suggesting p23 upregulates AR signalling at multiple stages. Moreover, p23 protein levels significantly increased upon treatment with not only androgen but also clinically relevant anti-androgens. This was in contrast to the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG, which did not modulate expression of the cochaperone \u2013 important given the HSP90-independent roles we and others have previously described for p23.Further, we demonstrate p23 is implicated in prostate cancer cell motility and in acquisition of invasiveness capacity through the expression of specific genes known to participate in cancer progression. This may drive metastatic processes in\u00a0vivo since analysis of prostate tumour biopsies revealed that high nuclear p23 significantly correlated with shorter survival times and with development of metastases in patients with lower grade tumours. We propose that increased p23 expression may allow cells to acquire a more aggressive phenotype, contributing to disease progression, and that p23 is a plausible secondary target in combination with HSP90 inhibition as a potential therapy for advanced prostate cancer.",

Therefore the current study investigated the outcomes of combining bortezomib with dipyridamole, a well-known antiplatelet. The co-treatment exerted a synergistic lethality in a panel of human leukemia/lymphoma cell lines of different origin. Mechanistically, dipyridamole did not modulate the proteasome inhibitory activity of bortezomib. However, dipyridamole triggered an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and co-treatment with bortezomib resulted in higher levels of ER stress than either monotherapies. Relieving ER stress with the protein translation inhibitor, cycloheximide suppressed cell death. Moreover, the enhanced ER stress by the co-treatment was associated with an aggravation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and glutathione (GSH) depletion. Replenishing GSH pools significantly scavenged ROS and rescued the cells. Importantly, the cytotoxicity of the co-treatment was executed mainly via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway with an efficient suppression of the key anti-apoptotic regulators, Mcl-1, Bcl-xl, Bcl-2 and XIAP, driving the independence of the co-treatment-induced apoptosis of a single apoptotic trigger. Furthermore, the intrinsic potential of bortezomib to inhibit important pro-survival pathways was enhanced by dipyridamole in a GSH/ROS-dependent manner. Interestingly, dipyridamole abrogated JAK2 phosphorylation indirectly and selectively in cancer cells, and the co-treatment-induced cytotoxicity was preserved in a model of stromal-mediated chemoresistance. In nude mice, the antitumor activity of the co-treatment surpassed that of bortezomib monotherapy despite that synergy was lacking. In summary, findings of the present study provided a preclinical rationale which warrants further clinical evaluation of bortezomib/dipyridamole novel combination in hematologic malignancies.",

     "abstract": "Extensive research has demonstrated a tumor-promoting role of increased WNT5A expression in malignant melanoma. However, very little light has been shed upon how WNT5A expression is up-regulated in melanoma. A potential regulator of WNT5A expression is the pro-inflammatory cytokine Interleukin (IL)-6, which shares the ability of WNT5A to increase melanoma cell invasion. Here, we investigate whether IL-6 can promote melanoma cell motility through an increased expression of WNT5A. We clearly demonstrate that the WNT5A-antagonistic peptide Box5 could inhibit IL-6-induced melanoma cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, IL-6 stimulation of the human melanoma cell lines HTB63 and A375 increased the expression of WNT5A in a dose-dependent manner. To identify the signaling mechanism responsible for this up-regulation, we explored the involvement of the three main signals induced by IL-6; STAT3, Akt and ERK 1/2. Of these, only STAT3 was activated by IL-6 in the melanoma cell lines tested. However, the STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 failed to inhibit IL-6-induced WNT5A up-regulation in HTB63 and A375 cells. Nor did STAT3 siRNA silencing affect the expression of WNT5A. In search of an alternative signaling mechanism, we detected IL-6-induced activation of p38-MAPK in HTB63 and A375 cells. The p38-MAPK inhibitor SB203580 abolished the IL-6-induced WNT5A up-regulation and blocked IL-6-induced melanoma cell invasion. The latter effect could be rescued by the addition of recombinant WNT5A. Notably, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that only the p38\u03b1-MAPK isoform was activated by IL-6, and subsequent siRNA silencing of p38\u03b1-MAPK abolished the IL-6-induced up-regulation of WNT5A.

     "abstract": "Romidepsin and vorinostat are histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) that have activity in T-cell lymphomas, but have not gained traction in solid tumors. To gain deeper insight into mechanisms of HDACi efficacy, we systematically surveyed 19 cell lines with different molecular phenotypes, comparing romidepsin and vorinostat at equipotent doses. Acetylation at H3K9 and H4K8 along with 22 other histone lysine acetylation and methylation modifications were measured by reverse phase proteomics array (RPPA), and compared with growth inhibition (IC50), and cell cycle arrest. These assays typically used to assess HDACi effect showed that acetylation and methylation of specific lysine residues in response to HDACis were consistent across cell lines, and not related to drug sensitivity. Using a treatment duration more reflective of the clinical exposure, cell death detected by annexin staining following a 6\u00a0h drug exposure identified a subset of cell lines, including the T-cell lymphoma line, that was markedly more sensitive to HDAC inhibition. Kinetic parameters (Km values) were determined for lysine acetylation and for cell cycle data and were themselves correlated following HDACi exposure, but neither parameter correlated with cell death. The impact on cell survival signaling varied with the molecular phenotype. This study suggests that cellular response to HDACis can be viewed as two distinct effects: a chromatin effect and a cell death effect. All cells undergo acetylation, which is necessary but not sufficient for cell death. Cells not primed for apoptosis will not respond with cell death to the impact of altered histone acetylation. The divergent apoptotic responses observed reflect the variable clinical outcome of HDACi treatment. These observations should change our approach to the development of therapeutic strategies that exploit the dual activities of HDACis.",

Increasing evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are frequently aberrantly expressed in cancers, and some of them have been implicated in CRC biogenesis and prognosis. Using an lncRNA-mining approach, we constructed lncRNAs expression profiles in approximately 888 CRC samples. By applying unsupervised consensus clustering to LncRNA expression profiles, we identified five distinct molecular subtypes of CRC with different biological pathways and phenotypically distinct in their clinical outcome in both univariate and multivariate analysis. The prognostic significance of the lncRNA-based classifier was confirmed in independent patient cohorts. Further analysis revealed that most of the signature lncRNAs positively correlated with somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). This lncRNAs-based classification schema thus provides a molecular classification applicable to individual tumors that has implications to influence treatment decisions.",

Evidence including live-cell imaging and isobologram analysis indicated that targeting KIF11 and Aurora A together promoted monoastral spindle formation and mitotic catastrophe synergistically, supporting a model of parallel pathways of centrosome regulation by Aurora A and KIF11. We also developed a KIF15-dependent SB743921-resistance cell model. Significantly, the drug-resistance could also be overcome with Aurora A inhibitors.

Using in\u00a0vitro cell models of UGCs, we investigated whether AURKA can regulate Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3). Our data indicate that overexpression of AURKA in FLO-1 and AGS cells increase STAT3 phosphorylation at the Tyr705 site, whereas AURKA genetic depletion by siRNA results in decreased phosphorylation levels of STAT3 in FLO-1 and MKN45 cells. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that AURKA overexpression enhanced STAT3 nuclear translocation while AURKA genetic knockdown reduced the nuclear translocation of STAT3 in AGS and FLO-1 cells, respectively. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that AURKA expression induces transcriptional activity of STAT3. Pharmacological inhibition of AURKA by MLN8237 reduced STAT3 phosphorylation along with down-regulation of STAT3 pro-survival targets, BCL2 and MCL1. Moreover, by using clonogenic cells survival assay, we showed that MLN8237 single dose treatment reduced the ability of FLO-1 and AGS cells to form colonies. Additional experiments utilizing cell models of overexpression and knockdown of AURKA indicated that STAT3 upstream non-receptor tyrosine kinase Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) is mediating the effect of AURKA on STAT3. The inhibition of JAK2 using JAK2-specific inhibitor AZD1480 or siRNA knockdown, in presence of AURKA overexpression, abrogated the AURKA-mediated STAT3 activation. These results confirm that the AURKA-JAK2 axis is the main mechanism by which AURKA regulates STAT3 activity. In conclusion, we report, for the first time, that AURKA promotes STAT3 activity through regulating the expression and phosphorylation levels of JAK2. This highlights the importance of targeting AURKA as a therapeutic approach to treat gastric and esophageal cancers.",

Decreased DNA integrity resulting from tumor cell instability is important in generating favorable therapeutic indices, and intact DNA repair mediates resistance to therapy. Targeting DNA repair to promote the action of anti-cancer agents is therefore an attractive therapeutic strategy. BRCA2 is involved in homologous recombination repair. BRCA2 defects increase cancer risk but, paradoxically, cancer patients with BRCA2 mutations have better survival rates. We queried TCGA data and found that BRCA2 alterations led to increased survival in patients with ovarian and endometrial cancer. We developed a BRCA2-targeting second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), which sensitized human lung, ovarian, and breast cancer cells to cisplatin by as much as 60%. BRCA2 ASO treatment overcame acquired cisplatin resistance in head and neck cancer cells, but induced minimal cisplatin sensitivity in non-tumor cells. BRCA2 ASO plus cisplatin reduced respiration as an early event preceding cell death, concurrent with increased glucose uptake without a difference in glycolysis. BRCA2 ASO and cisplatin decreased metastatic frequency in\u00a0vivo by 77%. These results implicate BRCA2 as a regulator of metastatic frequency and cellular metabolic response following cisplatin treatment.

ZNF217 enhances the recruitment of ER\u03b1 to its estrogen response elements (ERE) and the ER\u03b1-dependent transcription of the GREB1 estrogen-regulated gene. The prognostic power of ZNF217 mRNA expression levels is most discriminatory in breast cancers classified with a \u201cgood prognosis\u201d, particularly the Luminal-A subclass. A new immunohistochemistry ZNF217 index, based on nuclear and cytoplasmic ZNF217 staining, also allowed the identification of intermediate/poor relapse-free survivors in the Luminal-A subgroup. ZNF217 confers tamoxifen resistance in ER+ breast cancer cells and is a predictor of relapse under endocrine therapy in patients with ER+ breast cancer. ZNF217 thus allows the re-stratification of patients with ER+ breast cancers considered as cancers with good prognosis where no other biomarkers are currently available and widely used.

This work identifies a combination of targeted agents and doxorubicin that are effective against small cell sarcoma cell lines.Three small cell sarcoma cell lines were studied: RD18 (rhabdomyosarcoma), A204 (undifferentiated sarcoma) and TC 71 (Ewing's sarcoma). Each cell line was exposed to increasing concentrations of vorinostat (HDAC inhibitor), 17-DMAG (HSP90 inhibitor), abacavir (anti-telomerase) or sorafenib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) alone, combined with one another, or combined with doxorubicin. Cell viability, cell cycle analysis and apoptosis were assessed by MTS assay, propidium iodide-Annexin V staining, and caspase 3/7 activity, respectively.

Dual-targeted combination therapies with vorinostat, sorafenib and 17-DMAG demonstrated synergy. Abacavir was antagonistic with every other drug and was not further studied. Both vorinostat and 17-DMAG synergized with doxorubicin, achieving 60% cell killing compared to 12% with doxorubicin alone. No synergy was observed for sorafenib with doxorubicin.

Both diseases are increasing in most countries, and the genetic association between them has not been fully elucidated. The objective of this study was to assess the association between genetic risk factors of metabolic syndrome or related conditions (obesity, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus type 2) and clinical outcome in stage II colorectal cancer patients. Expression levels of several genes related to metabolic syndrome and associated alterations were analysed by real-time qPCR in two equivalent but independent sets of stage II colorectal cancer patients. Using logistic regression models and cross-validation analysis with all tumour samples, we developed a metabolic syndrome-related gene expression profile to predict clinical outcome in stage II colorectal cancer patients. The results showed that a gene expression profile constituted by genes previously related to metabolic syndrome was significantly associated with clinical outcome of stage II colorectal cancer patients. This metabolic profile was able to identify patients with a low risk and high risk of relapse. Its predictive value was validated using an independent set of stage II colorectal cancer patients. The identification of a set of genes related to metabolic syndrome that predict survival in intermediate-stage colorectal cancer patients allows delineation of a high-risk group that may benefit from adjuvant therapy and avoid the toxic and unnecessary chemotherapy in patients classified as low risk. Our results also confirm the linkage between metabolic disorder and colorectal cancer and suggest the potential for cancer prevention and/or treatment by targeting these genes.",

Although previous studies by our group identified novel roles of TRAP1 in quality control of mitochondria-destined proteins through the attenuation of protein synthesis, molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. To shed further light on the signaling pathways regulated by TRAP1 in the attenuation of protein synthesis, this study demonstrates that the entire pathway of cap-mediated translation is activated in cells following TRAP1 interference: consistently, expression and consequent phosphorylation of p70S6K and RSK1, two translation activating kinases, are increased upon TRAP1 silencing. Furthermore, we show that these regulatory functions affect the response to translational stress and cell migration in wound healing assays, processes involving both kinases. Notably, the regulatory mechanisms controlled by TRAP1 are conserved in colorectal cancer tissues, since an inverse correlation between TRAP1 and p70S6K expression is found in tumor tissues, thereby supporting the relevant role of TRAP1 translational regulation in\u00a0vivo. Taken as a whole, these new findings candidate TRAP1 network for new anti-cancer strategies aimed at targeting the translational/quality control machinery of tumor cells.",

The approach was based on altered cellular phenotypes induced by 55 FDA-approved drugs and biologically active compounds, acquired using fluorescence microscopy and retained in multivariate compound profiles. Dissimilarities between compound profiles guided the identification of 5 combinations, which were assessed for qualitative interaction on TNBC cell growth. The combination of the microtubule-targeting drug vinblastine with KSP/Eg5 motor protein inhibitors monastrol or ispinesib showed potent synergism in 3 independent TNBC cell lines, which was not substantiated in normal fibroblasts. The synergistic interaction was mediated by an increase in mitotic arrest with cells demonstrating typical ispinesib-induced monopolar mitotic spindles, which translated into enhanced apoptosis induction. The antitumour activity of the combination vinblastine/ispinesib was confirmed in an orthotopic mouse model of TNBC.

Previous experience has shown that the main limit to the efficacy of most targeted treatments is the advent of resistance. Mechanisms underlying resistance to MET-specific small tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been already described, while nothing is known about resistance to MET monoclonal antibodies, nor about bypassing resistance to chemical TKIs by antibodies or vice-versa. EBC1 lung cancer cells are MET-addicted as a consequence of gene amplification and thus sensitive to MET inhibitors, including the monovalent form of a MET monoclonal antibody (MV-DN30). We generated cells resistant to this antibody and found that resistance was due to a further increase of gene copy number and a dramatic overexpression of the MET receptor. Such an excess of expression saturated the \u2018shedding\u2019 activity of MV-DN30, and prevented both the efficient down-regulation of the MET receptor from the surface and the inhibition of the ensuing constitutive activation. Notably, antibody-resistant cells remained MET-\u2018addicted\u2019 and were still sensitive to MET TKIs. Moreover, antibody-resistant cells became \u2018drug-dependent\u2019, since the removal of MV-DN30 led them to death due to excess of signal. In the mirror experiment, cells made resistant to MET-specific TKIs were still sensitive to treatment with the antibody MV-DN30.

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma is deemed the most malignant form of brain tumour, particularly due to its resistance to conventional treatments. A small surviving group of aberrant stem cells termed glioma initiation cells (GICs) that escape surgical debulking are suggested to be the cause of this resistance. Relatively quiescent in nature, GICs are capable of driving tumour recurrence and undergo lineage differentiation. Most importantly, these GICs are resistant to radiotherapy, suggesting that radioresistance contribute to their survival. In a previous study, we demonstrated that GICs had a restricted double strand break (DSB) repair pathway involving predominantly homologous recombination (HR) associated with a lack of functional G1/S checkpoint arrest. This unusual behaviour led to less efficient non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair and overall slower DNA DSB repair kinetics. To determine whether specific targeting of the HR pathway with small molecule inhibitors could increase GIC radiosensitivity, we used the Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated inhibitor (ATMi) to ablate HR and the DNA-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (DNA-PKi) to inhibit NHEJ. Pre-treatment with ATMi prior to ionizing radiation (IR) exposure prevented HR-mediated DNA DSB repair as measured by Rad51 foci accumulation. Increased cell death in\u00a0vitro and improved in\u00a0vivo animal survival could be observed with combined ATMi and IR treatment. Conversely, DNA-PKi treatment had minimal impact on GICs ability to resolve DNA DSB after IR with only partial reduction in cell survival, confirming the major role of HR. These results provide a mechanistic insight into the predominant form of DNA DSB repair in GICs, which when targeted may be a potential translational approach to increase patient survival.",

This effect is replication-independent, as the radiosensitization remained unaffected following the inhibition of replication using aphidicolin. We showed that responders are radiosensitized by Olaparib because their DSB-repair is switched to PARP1-dependent end-joining (PARP1-EJ), as evident by (i) the significant increase in the number of residual \u03b3H2AX foci following irradiation with 3Gy and treatment with Olaparib, (ii) the enhanced enrichment of PARP1 at the chromatin after 3Gy and (iii) the inhibition of end-joining activity measured by a specific reporter substrate upon Olaparib treatment.

We aimed to characterize a novel procaspase-3 activator, WF-210, which may have potential as an anticancer drug.Experimental design: The procaspase-3 activating ability, antitumor efficacy, mechanisms of action, and toxicity profiles of WF-210 were investigated in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, using normal cells, cancer cells, and mouse xenograft models. The role of procaspase-3 in WF-210-induced apoptosis was explored by manipulating procaspase-3 expression in cultured cells.Results: WF-210 activated procaspase-3 with an EC50 of 0.95\u00a0\u03bcM, less than half that of its mother compound PAC-1 (2.08\u00a0\u03bcM). The mechanism involved the chelation of inhibitory zinc ions, subsequently resulting in an auto-activation of procaspase-3. WF-210 was more cytotoxic than PAC-1 to human cancer cells, but less cytotoxic to normal cells. Cancer cells with high procaspase-3 expression, like HL-60 and U-937, were particularly sensitive. WF-210-induced the apoptosis of HL-60 and U-937 cells by activating procaspases and promoting proteasome-dependent degradation of XIAP and Survivin. The level of WF-210-induced apoptosis in cultured cells was related to the level of procaspase-3 expression. Finally, WF-210 was superior to PAC-1 in retarding the in\u00a0vivo growth of breast, liver and gallbladder xenograft tumors which overexpress procaspase-3, and induced no substantial weight loss or neurotoxicity. WF-210 and PAC-1 had no effect on the growth of MCF-7 xenograft tumors, which do not express procaspase-3.Conclusion: We identified WF-210 as a potent small-molecule activator of procaspase-3. The favorable antitumor activity and acceptable toxicity profile of WF-210 provide a strong rationale for its clinical evaluation in the treatment of tumors with high procaspase-3 expression.",

This study aimed to identify prognostic indicators, including individual responses to chemotherapy, in CRC patients. RNA-seq data was generated using 54 samples (normal colon, primary CRC, and liver metastases) from 18 CRC patients and genes associated with CRC aggressiveness were identified. A risk score based on these genes was developed and validated in four independent CRC patient cohorts (n\u00a0=\u00a01063). Diverse statistical methods were applied to validate the risk scoring system, including a generalized linear model likelihood ratio test, Kaplan\u2013Meier curves, a log-rank test, and the Cox model. TREM1 and CTGF were identified as two activated regulators associated with CRC aggressiveness. A risk score based on 19 genes regulated by TREM1 or CTGF activation (TCA19) was a significant prognostic indicator. In multivariate and subset analyses based on pathological staging, TCA19 was an independent risk factor (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.894, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.227\u20132.809, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

     "abstract": "The DNA damage response (DDR) machinery becomes commonly activated in response to oncogenes and during early stages of development of solid malignancies, with an exception of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs). The active DDR signaling evokes cell death or senescence but this anti-tumor barrier can be breached by defects in DDR factors, such as the ATM-Chk2-p53 pathway, thereby allowing tumor progression. The DDR barrier is strongly activated in brain tumors, particularly gliomas, due to oxidative damage and replication stress. Here, we took advantage of rare human primary intracranial germ cell tumors (PIGCTs), to address the roles of cell-intrinsic factors including cell of origin, versus local tissue environment, in the constitutive DDR activation in\u00a0vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis of 7 biomarkers on a series of 21 PIGCTs (germinomas and other subtypes), 20 normal brain specimens and 20 glioblastomas, revealed the following: i) The overall DDR signaling (\u03b3H2AX) and activation of the ATM-Chk2-p53 pathway were very low among the PIGCTs, reminiscent of TGCTs, and contrasting sharply with strong DDR activation in glioblastomas; ii) Except for one case of embryonal carcinoma, there were no clear aberrations in the ATM-Chk2-p53 pathway components among the PIGCT cohort; iii) Subsets of PIGCTs showed unusual cytosolic localization of Chk2 and/or ATM. Collectively, these results show that PIGCTs mimic the DDR activation patterns of their gonadal germ cell tumor counterparts, rather than the brain tumors with which they share the tissue environment. Hence cell-intrinsic factors and cell of origin dictate the extent of DDR barrier activation and also the ensuing pressure to select for DDR defects. Our data provide conceptually important insights into the role of DNA damage checkpoints in intracranial tumorigenesis, with implications for the differential biological responses of diverse tumor types to endogenous stress as well as to genotoxic treatments such as ionizing radiation or chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) have an overall poor prognosis, which is primarily due to a high metastatic capacity of these tumors. Novel therapeutic approaches to target the signaling pathways that promote metastasis are desirable, in order to improve the outcome for these patients. A loss of function of a microRNA, miR-206, is related to increased metastasis potential in breast cancers but the mechanism is not known. In this study, we show that miR-206 was decreased in TNBC clinical tumor samples and cell lines whereas one of its predicted targets, actin-binding protein CORO1C, was increased. Expression of miR-206 significantly reduced proliferation and migration while repressing CORO1C mRNA and protein levels. We demonstrate that miR-206 interacts with the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of CORO1C and regulates this gene post-transcriptionally. This post-transcriptional regulation was dependent on two miR-206-binding sites within the 3'-UTR of CORO1C and was relieved by mutations of corresponding sites. Further, silencing of CORO1C reduced tumor cell migration and affected the actin skeleton and cell morphology, similar to miR-206 expression, but did not reduce proliferation. In accordance with this, overexpression of CORO1C rescued the inhibitory effect of miR-206 on cell migration. Our findings suggest that miR-206 represses tumor cell migration through direct targeting of CORO1C in TNBC cells which modulates the actin filaments. This pathway is a novel mechanism that offers a mechanistic basis through which the metastatic potential of TNBC tumors could be targeted.",

Enhanced ErbB2 signaling induces cysteine cathepsin B and L expression leading to their higher proteolytic activity (zFRase activity), which is crucial for the invasion of ErbB2-positive breast cancer cells in\u00a0vitro. Here we introduce a simple screening system based on zFRase activity as a primary readout and a following robust invasion assay and lysosomal distribution analysis for the identification of compounds that can inhibit ErbB2-induced invasion. With an unbiased kinase inhibitor screen, we identified Bohemine/Roscovitine, G\u00f66979 and JAK3 inhibitor VI as compounds that can efficiently decrease cysteine cathepsin activity. Using the well-established and clinically relevant ErbB1 and ErbB2 inhibitor lapatinib as a positive control, we studied their ability to inhibit ErbB2-induced invasion in 3-dimensional Matrigel cultures. We found one of them, JAK3 inhibitor VI, capable of inhibiting invasion of highly invasive ErbB2-positive ovarian cancer cells as efficiently as lapatinib, whereas G\u00f66979 and Roscovitine displayed more modest inhibition. All compounds reversed the malignant, ErbB2-induced and invasion-supporting peripheral distribution of lysosomes. This effect was most evident for lapatinib and JAK3 inhibitor VI and milder for G\u00f66979 and Roscovitine. Our results further showed that JAK3 inhibitor VI function was independent of JAK kinases but involved downregulation of cathepsin L. We postulate that the screening method and the verification experiments that are based on oncogene-induced changes in lysosomal hydrolase activity and lysosomal distribution could be used for identification of novel inhibitors of ErbB2-induced invasiveness. Additionally, we introduce a novel function for lapatinib in controlling malignant lysosomal distribution, that may also be involved in its capability to inhibit ErbB2-induced invasion in\u00a0vivo.",

The most frequent toxicities were asthenia, neutropenia, nausea/vomiting and transaminitis. Two patients with progressive disease prior to trial inclusion achieved prolonged disease stabilization. Both had the germline variant G2071A in the RET gene, which led to constitutive activation of the protein product and Y-905 phosphorylation, both in transfectants and in patients with the alteration. This variant was sensitive to dovitinib; in addition both patients experienced progression upon medication withdrawal.Level 1B was the RP2D as it provided adequate pharmacodynamic exposure to dovitinib.

We previously demonstrated that inhibition of REV3 expression induces persistent DNA damage and growth arrest in cancer cells. To reveal determinants of this sensitivity and obtain insights into the cellular function of REV3, we performed whole human genome RNAi library screens aimed at identification of synthetic lethal interactions with REV3 in A549 lung cancer cells.

Treatment with the RNR-inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) synergistically increased the fraction of REV3-deficient cells containing single stranded DNA (ssDNA) as indicated by an increase in replication protein A (RPA). However, this increase was not accompanied by accumulation of the DNA damage marker \u03b3H2AX suggesting a role of REV3 in counteracting HU-induced replication stress (RS). Consistent with a role of REV3 in DNA replication, increased RPA staining was confined to HU-treated S-phase cells.

Studies of TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions have seldom been performed at the protein level, primarily due to the lack of high-quality antibodies suitable for quantitative studies. Herein, we applied a recently developed PRISM (high-pressure high-resolution separations with intelligent selection and multiplexing)-SRM (selected reaction monitoring) strategy for quantifying ERG protein in prostate cancer cell lines and tumors. The highly sensitive PRISM-SRM assays provided confident detection of 6 unique ERG peptides in both TMPRSS2-ERG positive cell lines and tissues, but not in cell lines or tissues lacking the TMPRSS2-ERG rearrangement, clearly indicating that ERG protein expression is significantly increased in the presence of the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. Significantly, our results provide evidence that two distinct ERG protein isoforms are simultaneously expressed in TMPRSS2-ERG positive samples as evidenced by the concomitant detection of two mutually exclusive peptides in two patient tumors and in the VCaP prostate cancer cell line. Three peptides, shared across almost all fusion protein products, were determined to be the most abundant peptides, providing \u201csignature\u201d peptides for detection of ERG over-expression resulting from TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion. The PRISM-SRM assays provide valuable tools for studying TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion protein products in prostate cancer.",

     "abstract": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) plays important roles in cell proliferation, differentiation or survival mainly through its surface G-protein-coupled receptors S1P1\u22125. Bone represents the major site of metastasis for prostate cancer (CaP) cells, which rely on bone-derived factors to support their proliferation and resistance to therapeutics.In the present work we have found that conditioned medium (CM) from the MC3T3 osteoblastic cell line or primary murine and human osteoblast-like cells, as well as co-culture with MC3T3 stimulate proliferation of CaP lines in S1P-dependent manner. In addition, osteoblastic-derived S1P induces resistance of CaP cells to therapeutics including chemotherapy and radiotherapy. When S1P release from osteoblastic cells is decreased (inhibition of SphK1, knock-down of SphK1 or the S1P transporter, Spns2 by siRNA) or secreted S1P neutralized with anti-S1P antibody, the proliferative and survival effects of osteoblasts on CaP cells are abolished. Because of the paracrine nature of the signaling, we studied the role of the S1P receptors expressed on CaP cells in the communication with S1P secreted by osteoblasts. Strategies aimed at down-regulating S1P1, S1P2 or S1P3 (siRNA, antagonists), established the exclusive role of the S1P/S1P1 signaling between osteoblasts and CaP cells.Bone metastases from CaP are associated with osteoblastic differentiation resulting in abnormal bone formation. We show that the autocrine S1P/S1P3 signaling is central during differentiation to mature osteoblasts by regulating Runx2 level, a key transcription factor involved in osteoblastic maturation. Importantly, differentiated osteoblasts exhibited enhanced secretion of S1P and further stimulated CaP cell proliferation in a S1P-dependent manner.By establishing the dual role of osteoblast-borne S1P on both osteoblastic differentiation and CaP cell proliferation and survival, we uncover the importance of S1P in the bone metastatic microenvironment, which may open a novel area of study for the treatment of CaP bone metastasis by targeting S1P.",

     "abstract": "The RANK/RANKL/OPG pathway is well known for bone destruction in skeletal metastases but has also been implicated in osteoclast-independent roles in tumorigenesis and de novo metastasis. Experimental data suggest contribution of progesterone to tumorigenesis may be mediated by RANKL. Importantly, modulation of this pathway became possible through the availability of denosumab, an artificial counterpart of OPG, but significant gaps remain in the translation of preclinical findings on the pathway. We analyzed gene expression of RANK, RANKL and OPG from 40 Affymetrix datasets encompassing 4467 primary breast cancers and focused on ER positive disease.We did not observe a significant prognostic value of RANK and RANKL mRNA expression. In contrast, OPG was associated with a better prognosis among 1941\u00a0ER positive cancers (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.53\u20130.77; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) using a cutoff from its highly bimodal expression. We detected considerable heterogeneity regarding the prognostic value of OPG between different datasets. This heterogeneity could neither be attributed to technical reasons nor to differences in standard clinical parameters or treatments of the cohorts. Interestingly, the prognostic value of the progesterone receptor and of OPG showed similar cohort specific effects. Still both factors were no surrogates for each other but contributed independent prognostic value in multivariate analyses.Thus, both OPG and PgR are independently associated with good prognosis in ER positive breast cancer. However both markers share common cohort specific differences in contrast to proliferation markers as Ki67 which may be based on the underlying biology.",

     "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer death. Systematically characterizing miRNAs in NSCLC will help develop biomarkers for its diagnosis and subclassification, and identify therapeutic targets for the treatment. We used next-generation deep sequencing to comprehensively characterize miRNA profiles in eight lung tumor tissues consisting of two major types of NSCLC, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (AC). We used quantitative PCR (qPCR) to verify the findings in 40 pairs of stage I NSCLC tissues and the paired normal tissues, and 60 NSCLC tissues of different types and stages. We also investigated the function of identified miRNAs in lung tumorigenesis. Deep sequencing identified 896 known miRNAs and 14 novel miRNAs, of which, 24 miRNAs displayed dysregulation with fold change \u22654.5 in either stage I ACs or SCCs or both relative to normal tissues. qPCR validation showed that 14 of 24 miRNAs exhibited consistent changes with deep sequencing data. Seven miRNAs displayed distinctive expressions between SCC and AC, from which, a panel of four miRNAs (miRs-944, 205-3p, 135a-5p, and 577) was identified that cold differentiate SCC from AC with 93.3% sensitivity and 86.7% specificity. Manipulation of miR-944 expression in NSCLC cells affected cell growth, proliferation, and invasion by targeting a tumor suppressor, SOCS4. Evaluating miR-944 in 52 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded SCC tissues revealed that miR-944 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis. This study presents the earliest use of deep sequencing for profiling miRNAs in lung tumor specimens. The identified miRNA signatures may provide biomarkers for early detection, subclassification, and predicting metastasis, and potential therapeutic targets of NSCLC.",

Mutations in procaspase-8 occur in 9% of HNSCC primary tumors, but the functional consequences of these mutations are poorly understood. In this study, we examined the impact of four, representative, HNSCC-associated procaspase-8 mutations on activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, as well as cellular migration and invasion, and in\u00a0vivo tumor growth. All four mutant proteins acted to potently inhibit activation of apoptosis following treatment with TRAIL or agonistic anti-Fas. In contrast to wild-type procaspase-8, the mutant proteins were not recruited to FADD following treatment with TRAIL or anti-Fas, but may be constitutively bound by FADD. Three of the four procaspase-8 mutants promoted enhanced cellular migration and invasion through matrigel, relative to that seen with the wild-type procaspase-8 protein. Procaspase-8 mutation also stimulated the growth of HNSCC xenograft tumors. These findings indicate that HNSCC-associated procaspase-8 mutations inhibit activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway and are likely to represent markers for resistance to therapeutic regimens incorporating death receptor activators. Moreover, procaspase-8 mutations may serve as markers of HNSCC tumor progression, as exemplified by enhanced migration, invasion, and tumor growth.",

     "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are a group of growth factors with dual functions in cancer development and progression. Recently, certain tumor-promoting roles have been identified for selected antagonists/inhibitors (BMPIs) of this developmental pathway. A recent focus on the implication of BMP in colorectal cancer progression has emerged, mainly due to the presence of inactivating mutations in several members of the canonical signaling cascade. However, the detailed expression profiles of BMPIs remain largely unknown. Based on our previous work, whereby three specific BMPIs, gremlin-1 (GREM1), high-temperature requirement A3 (HTRA3) and follistatin (FST) were collectively overexpressed in desmoplastic cocultures of colorectal cancer (CRC), here, we undertook an immunohistochemical approach to describe the patterns of their expression in CRC patients. Two major characteristics described the BMPI expression signature: First, the synchronous and coordinated stromal and epithelial overexpression of individual BMPIs in desmoplastic lesions, which demonstrated that all three of them contribute to increasing levels of BMP antagonism in such areas. Second, the presence of microenvironmental polarity in the BMPI pattern of expression, which was indicated through the preferential expression of HTRA3 in the stromal, and the parallel FST/GREM1 expression in the epithelial component of the investigated sections. In addition, expression of HTRA3 in the epithelial compartment of the tumors demonstrated a significant predictive power to discriminate between tumor-budding-bearing and tumor-budding-free desmoplastic microenvironments. Together, these findings contribute to the understanding of signaling dynamics of BMP antagonism in the colorectal cancer desmoplastic invasion front.",

The factors driving the development of this subset are not well understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that acquisition of a mesenchymal phenotype occurs selectively in tumor cells that harbor specific enabling genetic alterations. We obtained whole-genome comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) measurements on pancreatic cancer cell lines that have either an epithelial-like (17 cell lines) or a mesenchymal-like (9 cell lines) phenotype in\u00a0vitro. The total amounts of amplifications and deletions were equivalent between the epithelial and mesenchymal groups, but 20 genes showed a major difference between the groups in prevalence of alterations. All 20 alterations (18 deletions and 2 amplifications) were more prevalent in the mesenchymal group, confirming the advanced nature of this cellular subtype. CDKN2A was altered in more than 50% of both groups, but co-deletions in neighboring genes, and concomitant loss of gene expression, were more prevalent in the mesenchymal group, suggesting that the size of the loss around CDKN2A affects cell phenotype. Whole-genome CGH on 11 primary cancer tissues revealed that the 20 genes were altered at a higher prevalence (up to 55% of the cases for certain genes) than randomly selected sets of 20 genes, with the same direction of alteration as in the cell lines. These findings support the concept that specific genetic alterations enable phenotype plasticity and provide promising candidate genes for further research.",

Despite the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for the targeted therapy of several malignancies, no agent has been developed to specifically interfere with the oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling aberrations found in HCC. Therefore, we adopted an orthogonal biological phenotypic screening approach to uncover candidate compounds: based on a potent cytotoxicity toward\u00a0HCC-derived cell lines, and minimal toxicity toward\u00a0normal liver cells. Given the success of indolinone as a chemical scaffold in deriving potent multi-kinase inhibitors (e.g. sunitinib), we screened a group of newly synthesized benzylidene-indolinones. Among the candidates, E/Z 6-Chloro-3-(3-trifluoromethyl-benzyliden)-1,3-dihydroindol-2-one (compound 47) exhibited potent anti-proliferative, anti-migratory, pro-apoptotic properties and good safety profile as compared to known multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors sunitinib and sorafenib. Additionally, an accompanying suppression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) transcription, an HCC tumor marker, implies a favorable selectivity and efficacy on HCC. The in\u00a0vivo efficacy was demonstrated in an HCC xenograft where 47 was administered once weekly (60\u00a0mg/kg) and suppressed tumor burden to the same extent as sorafenib (30\u00a0mg/kg daily). A receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) array study revealed promising inhibition of multiple tyrosine kinases such as IGF-1R, Tyro3 and EphA2 phosphorylation. Gene silencing of these targets ameliorated the cytotoxic potential of 47 on the HuH7 cell line, thereby implicating their contribution to the tumorigenicity of HCC. Hence, 47 exhibits potent anti-cancer effects on HCC cell lines, and is a suitable lead for developing multi-targeted kinase inhibitors of relevance to HCC.",

Findings were validated on publicly available datasets of 684 node-negative BCs including all the subtypes.Only a metagene containing interferon-induced genes (IFN metagene) proved to be predictive of distant metastasis in our series of patients with ESR1+/ERBB2\u2212 tumors (P\u00a0=\u00a00.029), and such a finding was validated on 457 ESR1+/ERBB2\u2212 BCs from public datasets (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0424). Conversely, the IFN metagene was associated with a low risk of metastasis in 104 ERBB2+ tumors (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0099) whereas it did not prove to significantly affect prognosis in 123 ESR1\u2212/ERBB2\u2212 tumors (P\u00a0=\u00a00.2235). A complex prognostic interaction was revealed in ESR1+/ERBB2\u2212 and ERBB2+ tumors when the association between the IFN metagene and a T-cell metagene was considered.The study confirms the importance of analyzing prognostic variables separately within BC subtypes, highlights the advantages of using metagenes rather than genes, and finally identifies in node-negative ESR1+/ERBB2\u2212 BCs, the unfavorable role of high IFN metagene expression.",

In\u00a0vivo, CAFs were more competent as tumour growth enhancers than paired NCFs when co-inoculated with colorectal cell lines. Gene expression analysis of microarrays of CAF and paired NCF populations enabled us to identify 108 deregulated genes (38 upregulated and 70 downregulated genes). Most of those genes are fibroblast-specific. This has been validated in silico in dataset GSE39396 and by qPCR in selected genes. GSEA analysis revealed a differential transcriptomic profile of CAFs, mainly involving the Wnt signallingsignalling pathway, focal adhesion and cell cycle. Both deregulated genes and biological processes involved depicted a considerable degree of overlap with deregulated genes reported in breast, lung, oesophagus and prostate CAFs. These observations suggest that similar transcriptomic programs may be active in the transition from normal fibroblast in adjacent tissues to CAFs, independently of their anatomic demarcation. Additionally NCF already depicted an activated pattern associated with inflammation.The deregulated genes signature score seemed to correlate with CAF tumour promoter abilities in\u00a0vitro, suggesting a high degree of heterogeneity between CAFs, and it has also prognostic value in two independent datasets.Further characterization of the roles these biomarkers play in cancer will reveal how CAFs provide cancer cells with a suitable microenvironment and may help in the development of new therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.",

Integrative functional genomic investigation is a powerful approach to understand the major dysregulations and to identify the potential targets toward the development of targeted therapeutics for various cancers. Intestinal and diffuse type gastric tumors remain the major subtypes and the molecular determinants and drivers of these distinct subtypes remain unidentified. In this investigation, by exploring the network of gene coexpression association in gastric tumors, mRNA expressions of 20,318 genes across 200 gastric tumors were categorized into 21 modules. The genes and the hub genes of the modules show gastric cancer subtype specific expression. The expression patterns of the modules were correlated with intestinal and diffuse subtypes as well as with the differentiation status of gastric tumors. Among these, G1 module has been identified as a major driving force of diffuse type gastric tumors with the features of (i) enriched mesenchymal, mesenchymal stem cell like, and mesenchymal derived multiple lineages, (ii) elevated OCT1 mediated transcription, (iii) involvement of Notch activation, and (iv) reduced polycomb mediated epigenetic repression. G13 module has been identified as key factor in intestinal type gastric tumors and found to have the characteristic features of (i) involvement of embryonic stem cell like properties, (ii) Wnt, MYC and E2F mediated transcription programs, and (iii) involvement of polycomb mediated repression. Thus the differential transcription programs, differential epigenetic regulation and varying stem cell features involved in two major subtypes of gastric cancer were delineated by exploring the gene coexpression network. The identified subtype specific dysregulations could be optimally employed in developing subtype specific therapeutic targeting strategies for gastric cancer.",

     "abstract": "Better approaches are needed to evaluate a single patient's drug response at the genomic level. Targeted therapy for signaling pathways in cancer has met limited success in part due to the exceedingly interwoven nature of the pathways. In particular, the highly complex RAS network has been challenging to target. Effectively targeting the pathway requires development of techniques that measure global network activity to account for pathway complexity. For this purpose, we used a gene-expression-based biomarker for RAS network activity in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and screened for drugs whose efficacy was significantly highly correlated to RAS network activity. Results identified EGFR and MEK co-inhibition as the most effective treatment for RAS-active NSCLC amongst a panel of over 360 compounds and fractions. RAS activity was identified in both RAS-mutant and wild-type lines, indicating broad characterization of RAS signaling inclusive of multiple mechanisms of RAS activity, and not solely based on mutation status. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that co-inhibition of EGFR and MEK induced apoptosis and blocked both EGFR-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK and EGFR-PI3K-AKT-RPS6 nodes simultaneously in RAS-active, but not RAS-inactive NSCLC. These results provide a comprehensive strategy to personalize treatment of NSCLC based on RAS network dysregulation and provide proof-of-concept of a genomic approach to classify and target complex signaling networks.",

Mechanisms that regulate SLUG/E-cadherin pathway remain poorly understood, especially during tumorigenesis in\u00a0vivo. Here we report that p19Arf (p14ARF in human) stabilizes Slug to inhibit E-cadherin in prostate cancer mouse models. Inactivation of p19Arf reduces Slug levels, resulting in increased E-cadherin expression and delaying the onset and progression of prostate cancer in Pten/Trp53 double null mice. Mechanistically, p14ARF stabilizes SLUG through increased sumoylation at lysine residue 192. Importantly, levels of SLUG and p14ARF are positively correlated in human prostate cancer specimens. These data demonstrated that ARF modulates the SLUG/E-cadherin signaling axis for augmenting prostate tumorigenesis in\u00a0vivo, revealing a novel paradigm where the oncogenic functions of SLUG require ARF to target E-cadherin in prostate cancer.

The development of new therapeutic strategies should therefore be triggered by the understanding of the underlying biology through sophisticated clinical trials. Therefore, the methodology and the design of cancer clinical trials as well as the methods of their implementation are under profound changes. Targeting specific pathways has open the hope of a more focused and personalized medicine which has the potential to bring more efficient and tailored treatments to patients. It has been questioned therefore whether clinical trials traditionally designed for specific tumor types could not re-visited towards trials gathering patients based on molecular features rather than pure pathology criteria. The complexity of the cancer biology being the result of so many different interactive mechanisms whether driving or not the process of cancer cells is an additional level of complexity to approach more inclusive clinical trial access. Nevertheless, a number of innovative solutions to address biological challenges across histologies have been initiated and the question of whether histology agnostic trials could be conceived is a logical next question. This paper questions the advantages and the limits of clinical trials performed across tumor types bearing similar selected molecular features and looks further into the feasibility of such histology agnostic trials.",

     "abstract": "There are currently no highly sensitive and specific minimally invasive biomarkers for detection of early-stage breast cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are present in the circulation and may be unique biomarkers for early diagnosis of human cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in the serum of breast cancer patients and healthy controls.Global miRNA analysis was performed on serum from 48 patients with ER-positive early-stage breast cancer obtained at diagnosis (24 lymph node-positive and 24 lymph node-negative) and 24 age-matched healthy controls using LNA-based quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). A signature of miRNAs was subsequently validated in an independent set of 111 serum samples from 60 patients with early-stage breast cancer and 51 healthy controls and further tested for reproducibility in 3 independent data sets from the GEO Database.A multivariable signature consisting of 9 miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-18a, miR-107, miR-133a, miR-139-5p, miR-143, miR-145, miR-365, miR-425) was identified that provided considerable discrimination between breast cancer patients and healthy controls. Further, the ability of the 9 miRNA signature to stratify samples from breast cancer patients and healthy controls was confirmed in the validation set (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) with a corresponding AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.665 in the ROC-curve analysis. No association between miRNA expression and tumor grade, tumor size, menopausal- or lymph node status was observed. The signature was also successfully validated in a previously published independent data set of circulating miRNAs in early-stage breast cancer (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024).We present herein a 9 miRNA signature capable of discriminating between ER-positive breast cancer and healthy controls. Using a specific algorithm based on the 9 miRNA signature, the risk for future individuals can be predicted. Since microRNAs are highly stable in blood components, this signature might be useful in the development of a blood-based multi-marker test to improve early detection of breast cancer. Such a test could potentially be used as a screening tool to identify individuals who would benefit from further diagnostic assessment.",

Dub3 overexpression abrogates focus formation of 53BP1 and BRCA1 in response to genotoxic stress. However, focus formation of MDC1 and \u03b3H2AX, earlier events in this response, are unaffected by Dub3 overexpression. We show that Dub3 counteracts H2AX E3 ligases RNF8 and RNF168. Moreover, Dub3 and H2AX interact and Dub3 deubiquitinates H2AX in\u00a0vitro. Importantly, overexpression of Dub3 delays H2AX dephosphorylation and recovery of MDC1 focus formation at later time points after DNA damage, whereas H2AX dephosphorylation at later time points is faster after Dub3 depletion.

The expression of this three-exon GLI1 antisense (GLI1AS) RNA in cancer cells was concordant with GLI1 levels. siRNAs knockdown of GLI1AS up-regulated GLI1 and increased cellular proliferation and tumor growth in a xenograft model system. Conversely, GLI1AS overexpression decreased the levels of GLI1, its target genes PTCH1 and PTCH2, and cellular proliferation. Additionally, we demonstrate that GLI1 knockdown reduced GLI1AS, while GLI1 overexpression increased GLI1AS, supporting the role of GLI1AS as a target gene of the GLI1 transcription factor. Activation of TGF\u03b2 and Hedgehog signaling, two known regulators of GLI1 expression, conferred a concordant up-regulation of GLI1 and GLI1AS in cancer cells. Finally, analysis of the mechanism underlying the interplay between GLI1 and GLI1AS indicates that the non-coding RNA elicits a local alteration of chromatin structure by increasing the silencing mark H3K27me3 and decreasing the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to this locus. Taken together, the data demonstrate the existence of a novel non-coding RNA-based negative feedback loop controlling GLI1 levels, thus expanding the repertoire of mechanisms regulating the expression of this oncogenic transcription factor.",

Forced expression of SOCS1 in metastatic colorectal SW620 cells reverses many characteristics of Epithelial\u2013Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), as highlighted by the disappearance of the transcription factor ZEB1 and the mesenchymal form of p120ctn and the re-expression of E-cadherin. Furthermore, miRNA profiling indicated that SOCS1 also up-regulates the expression of the mir-200 family of miRNAs, which can promote the mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition and reduce tumor cell migration. Accordingly, overexpression of SOCS1 induced cell morphology changes and dramatically reduced tumor cell invasion in\u00a0vitro. When injected in nude mice, SOCS1-expressing SW620 cells induced metastases in a smaller number of animals than parental SW620 cells, and did not generate any adrenal gland or bone metastasis.

     "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is highly resistant to conventional therapeutics and has been shown to evade apoptosis by deregulation of the X-linked and cellular inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (XIAP and cIAP). Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) induces and amplifies cell death by reversing the anti-apoptotic activity of IAPs. Thus, Smac-derived peptide analogues (peptidomimetics) have been developed and shown to represent promising cancer therapeutics. Sigma-2 receptors are overexpressed in many proliferating tumor cells including pancreatic cancer. Selected ligands to this receptor are rapidly internalized by cancer cells. These characteristics have made the sigma-2 receptor an attractive target for drug delivery because selective delivery to cancer cells has the potential to increase therapeutic efficacy while minimizing toxicity to normal tissues.Here, we describe the initial characterization of SW IV-134, a chemically linked drug conjugate between the sigma-2 ligand SW43 and the Smac mimetic SW IV-52 as a novel treatment option for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The tumor killing characteristics of our dual-domain therapeutic SW IV-134 was far greater than either component in isolation or in an equimolar mix and suggests enhanced cellular delivery when chemically linked to the sigma-2 ligand. One of the key findings was that SW IV-134 retained target selectivity of the Smac cargo with the involvement of the NF-\u03baB/TNF\u03b1 signaling pathway.

     "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very aggressive subgroup of breast carcinoma, still lacking specific markers for an effective targeted therapy and with a poorer prognosis compared to other breast cancer subtypes.In this study we investigated the possibility that TNBC cells contribute to the establishment of tumor vascular network by the process known as vasculogenic mimicry, through endothelial cell differentiation.Vascular-like functional properties of breast cancer cell lines were investigated in\u00a0vitro by tube formation assay and in\u00a0vivo by confocal microscopy, immunofluorescence or immunohistochemistry on frozen tumor sections. TNBCs express endothelial markers and acquire the ability to form vascular-like channels in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo, both in xenograft models and in human specimens, generating blood lacunae surrounded by tumor cells. Notably this feature is significantly associated with reduced disease free survival. The impairment of the main pathways involved in vessel formation, by treatment with inhibitors (i.e. Sunitinib and Bevacizumab) or by siRNA-mediating silencing, allowed the identification of PDGFR\u03b2 and FGFR2 as relevant players in this phenomenon. Inhibition of these tyrosine kinase receptors negatively affects vascular lacunae formation and significantly inhibits TNBC growth in\u00a0vivo.In summary, we demonstrated that TNBCs have the ability to form vascular-like channels in\u00a0vitro and to generate blood lacunae lined by tumor cells in\u00a0vivo. Moreover, this feature is associated with poor outcome, probably contributing to the aggressiveness of this breast cancer subgroup. Finally, PDGFR\u03b2 and FGFR2-mediated pathways, identified as relevant in mediating this characteristic, potentially represent valid targets for a specific therapy of this breast cancer subgroup.",

Hence, the presence of T-regs in highly malignant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is correlated with short survival. Likewise, the adhesion molecule L1CAM is upregulated during PDAC progression in the pancreatic ductal epithelium also being associated with poor prognosis. To investigate whether L1CAM contributes to enrichment of T-regs in PDAC, human CD4+CD25+CD127\u2212CD49d\u2212 T-regs and CD4+CD25\u2212 T-effector cells (T-effs) were isolated by magnetic bead separation from blood of healthy donors. Their phenotype and functional behavior were analyzed in dependence on human premalignant (H6c7) or malignant (Panc1) pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, either exhibiting or lacking L1CAM expression. T cells derived from blood and tumors of PDAC patients were analyzed by flow cytometry and findings were correlated with clinical parameters. Predominantly T-regs but not T-effs showed an increased migration on L1CAM expressing H6c7 and Panc1 cells. Whereas proliferation of T-regs did not change in the presence of L1CAM, T-effs proliferated less, exhibited a decreased CD25 expression and an increased expression of CD69. Moreover, these T-effs exhibited a regulatory phenotype as they inhibited proliferation of autologous T cells. Accordingly, CD4+CD25\u2212CD69+ T cells were highly abundant in PDAC tissues compared to blood being associated with nodal invasion and higher grading in PDAC patients. Overall, these data point to an important role of L1CAM in the enrichment of immunosuppressive T cells in particular of a CD4+CD25\u2212CD69+-phenotype in PDAC providing a novel mechanism of tumor immune escape which contributes to tumor progression.",

     "abstract": "Although molecular signatures based on transcript expression in breast cancer samples have provided new insights into breast cancer classification and prognosis, there are acknowledged limitations in current signatures. To provide rational, pathway-based signatures of disrupted physiology in cancer tissues that may be relevant to prognosis, this study has directly quantitated changed gene expression, between normal breast and cancer tissue, as a basis for signature development. The nuclear receptor (NR) family of transcription factors, and their coregulators, are fundamental regulators of every aspect of metazoan life, and were rigorously quantified in normal breast tissues and ER\u03b1 positive and ER\u03b1 negative breast cancers. Coregulator expression was highly correlated with that of selected NR in normal breast, particularly from postmenopausal women. These associations were markedly decreased in breast cancer, and the expression of the majority of coregulators was down-regulated in cancer tissues compared with normal. While in cancer the loss of NR-coregulator associations observed in normal breast was common, a small number of NR (Rev-ERB\u03b2, GR, NOR1, LRH-1 and PGR) acquired new associations with coregulators in cancer tissues. Elevated expression of these NR in cancers was associated with poorer outcome in large clinical cohorts, as well as suggesting the activation of ER\u03b1 -related, but ER\u03b1-independent, pathways in ER\u03b1 negative cancers. In addition, the combined expression of small numbers of NR and coregulators in breast cancer was identified as a signature predicting outcome in ER\u03b1 negative breast cancer patients, not linked to proliferation and with predictive power superior to existing signatures containing many more genes. These findings highlight the power of predictive signatures derived from the quantitative determination of altered gene expression between normal breast and breast cancers. Taken together, the findings of this study identify networks of NR-coregulator associations active in normal breast but disrupted in breast cancer, and moreover provide evidence that signatures based on NR networks disrupted in cancer can provide important prognostic information in breast cancer patients.",

A total of 142/822 fresh frozen tissues were available with good quality RNA and analyzed by gene expression microarray. Gene expression molecular subtypes were determined by correlation to the expression centroids of 534 \u201cintrinsic\u201d genes. Sections of a tissue micro array containing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue of 714/822 patients were immunohistochemically (IHC) stained for Ki67, EGFR, CK5/6. Tumor expression of ER, PR, HER2 was previously determined. IHC molecular subtypes were defined based on expression of these markers: Luminal A: ER+ and/or PR+, HER2\u2013 and Ki67\u2013; Luminal B: ER+ and/or PR+ and ki67+; ERBB2: ER\u2013, PR\u2013 and HER2+; Basal-like: ER\u2013, PR\u2013, HER2\u2013 and EGFR+ and/or CK5/6+; Unclassified: ER\u2013, PR\u2013, HER2\u2013, EGFR\u2013 and CK5/6\u2013. IHC molecular subtypes were validated against gene expression defined molecular subtypes. Assessment of distribution and prognostic effect of molecular subtypes was stratified to age (<65 versus \u226565 years).Validation of molecular subtypes determined by IHC against gene expression revealed a substantial agreement in classification (Cohen's kappa coefficient 0.75). A statistically significant association (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) was found between molecular subtypes and age, where Luminal tumors were more often found in elderly patients, while ERBB2, basal-like and unclassified subtypes were more often found in young patients. Molecular subtypes showed a prognostic association with outcome in young patients concerning relapse-free period (RFP) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and relative survival (RS) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No statistically significant prognostic effect was found for molecular subtypes in elderly patients (RFP p\u00a0=\u00a00.5; RS p\u00a0=\u00a00.1). Additional analyses showed that no molecular subtypes showed a statistically significant difference in outcome for elderly compare to young patients.We have shown that molecular subtypes have a different distribution and prognostic effect in elderly compared to young breast cancer patients, emphasizing the fact that biomarkers may have different distributions and prognostic effects and therefore different implications in elderly compared to their younger counterparts. Our results support the premise that breast cancer clinical behavior is significantly affected by patient age. We suggest that competing risks of death in elderly patients, ER-driven differences and micro-environmental changes in biology are underlying these age-dependent variations in patient prognosis.",

Here, we investigated the effect of single point mutations in the oligomerization domain (OD) on tetramerization, transcription, ubiquitylation and stability of p53. As predicted by docking and molecular dynamics simulations, p53 OD mutants show functional defects on transcription, Mdm2-dependent ubiquitylation and 26S proteasome-mediated degradation. However, mutants unable to form tetramers are well degraded by the 20S proteasome. Unexpectedly, despite the lower structural stability compared to WT p53, p53 OD mutants form heterotetramers with WT p53 when expressed transiently or stably in cells wild type or null for p53. In consequence, p53 OD mutants interfere with the capacity of WT p53 tetramers to be properly ubiquitylated and result in changes of p53-dependent protein expression patterns, including the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and PUMA under basal and adriamycin-induced conditions. Importantly, the patient derived p53 OD mutant L330R (OD1) showed the more severe changes in p53-dependent gene expression. Thus, in addition to the well-known effects on p53 stability, ubiquitylation defects promote changes in p53-dependent gene expression with implications on some of its functions.",

Inhibition of RalA by gene-specific silencing caused a robust decrease in the viability and invasiveness of HCC cells. Additionally, the use of geranyl\u2013geranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI, an inhibitor of Ral activation) and Aurora kinase inhibitor II resulted in a significant decrease in the proliferation of HCC cells. Furthermore, RalA activation was found to be at a higher level of activation in HCC stem cells that express CD133. Transgenic mouse model for HCC (FXR-Knockout) also revealed an elevated level of RalA-GTP in the liver tumors as compared to background animals. Finally, subcutaneous mouse model for HCC confirmed effectiveness of inhibition of aurora kinase/RalA pathway in reducing the tumorigenesis of HCC cells in\u00a0vivo.

Important limitations, however, are that not every patient benefits from a specific antibody therapy and that responses could be short-lived due to acquired resistance. In addition, targeted therapies are quite expensive and are not completely devoid of side-effects. This urges the need for accurate patient selection and response monitoring.An important step towards personalizing antibody treatment could be the implementation of theranostics. Antibody theranostics combine the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of an antibody, thereby selecting those patients who are most likely to benefit from antibody treatment. This review focuses on the clinical application of theranostic antibodies in oncology. It provides detailed information concerning the suitability of antibodies for theranostics, the different types of theranostic tests available and summarizes the efficacy of theranostic antibodies used in current clinical practice. Advanced theranostic applications, including radiolabeled antibodies for non-invasive functional imagining, are also addressed. Finally, we discuss the importance of theranostics in the emerging field of personalized medicine and critically evaluate recent data to determine the best way to apply antibody theranostics in the future.",

The relative simplicity of qPCR experiments, which deliver fast and cost-effective results, means that each year an increasing number of papers utilizing this technique are being published. But how reliable are the published results? Since the validity of gene expression data is greatly dependent on appropriate normalisation to compensate for sample-to-sample and run-to-run variation, we have evaluated the adequacy of normalisation procedures in qPCR-based experiments. Consequently, we assessed all colorectal cancer publications that made use of qPCR from 2006 until August 2013 for the number of reference genes used and whether they had been validated. Using even these minimal evaluation criteria, the validity of only three percent (6/179) of the publications can be adequately assessed. We describe common errors, and conclude that the current state of reporting on qPCR in colorectal cancer research is disquieting. Extrapolated to the study of cancer in general, it is clear that the majority of studies using qPCR cannot be reliably assessed and that at best, the results of these studies may or may not be valid and at worst, pervasive incorrect normalisation is resulting in the wholesale publication of incorrect conclusions. This survey demonstrates that the existence of guidelines, such as MIQE, is necessary but not sufficient to address this problem and suggests that the scientific community should examine its responsibility and be aware of the implications of these findings for current and future research.",

Recognising the need for scientists to act collectively in order to contribute to shape the future of science policy in Europe, a pioneering group of European science organisations leaders and representatives, as well as other scientists, initiated a European, interdisciplinary, inclusive movement leading to the creation of the European Research Council (ERC) to support basic research of the highest quality. Having scientists' campaign for the funding of bottom-up research by the EU Framework Programmes exclusively on scientific grounds, and for an ERC, was a unique event in the recent history of European science policy. For the first time, the scientific community acted collectively and across disciplinary or national boundaries as a political actor for the sake of a better science policy for Europe.As is often the case when first-hand experience is gained through the creation of a new organization, novel forms of collaboration arise. The European biomedical community has recently proposed the creation of a strategic action plan for health research (the European Council of Health Research; EuCHR), provisionally translated at present into a Scientific Panel for Health (SPH) research in Horizon 2020, the EU's research-funding programme for the period 2014\u20132020. The creation of such Scientific Panel should be viewed as an important contribution by the biomedical community as a major political agreement has been reached on the need for a comprehensive and long-term scientific strategy to accelerate research and facilitate innovation at EU level.It is our belief that describing and analyzing the process leading to the creation of the ERC and SPH (2002\u20132014) should be widely shared with the research community in general, as this may contribute to the understanding of the evolving relations between scientists and science-policy making.",

     "abstract": "The DNA damage response (DDR) is activated upon DNA damage and prevents accumulation of mutations and chromosomal rearrangements, both driving carcinogenesis. Tumor cells often have defects in the DDR, which in combination with continuous cell proliferation are exploited by genotoxic cancer therapies. Most cancers, overcome initial sensitivity and develop drug resistance, e.g. by modulation of the DDR. Not much is known, however, about DNA damage responsive microRNAs in cancer therapy resistance. Therefore, we mapped temporal microRNA expression changes in primary breast epithelial cells upon low and high dose exposure to the DNA damaging agents ionizing radiation and cisplatin. A third of all DDR microRNAs commonly regulated across all treatments was also misexpressed in breast cancer, indicating a DDR defect. We repeated this approach in primary lung epithelial cells and non-small cell lung cancer samples and found that more than 40% of all DDR microRNAs was deregulated in non-small cell lung cancer. Strikingly, the microRNA response upon genotoxic stress in primary breast and lung epithelial cells was markedly different, although the biological outcome of DNA damage signaling (cell death/senescence or survival) was similar. Several DDR microRNAs deregulated in cancer modulated sensitivity to anti-cancer agents. In addition we were able to distinguish between microRNAs that induced resistance by potentially inducing quiescence (miR-296-5p and miR-382) or enhancing DNA repair or increased DNA damage tolerance (miR-21). In conclusion, we provide evidence that DNA damage responsive microRNAs are frequently misexpressed in human cancer and can modulate chemotherapy sensitivity.",

Here, we studied polyploidy-associated senescence induced by BMS-777607 in breast cancer cells and its prevention by mTOR inhibitor AZD8055, leading to increased chemosensitivity. In breast cancer T-47D and ZR-75-1 cells, BMS-777607 induced phenotypic changes including enlarged cellular size, flattened morphology, increased DNA content, and activity of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase. These changes were accompanied by increased p21/WAF1 expression and decreased Retinoblastoma Ser780 phosphorylation, indicating that BMS-777607 induces not only polyploidy but also senescence. The appearance of senescence was associated with polyploidy in which \u03b2-galactosidase is exclusively expressed in polyploid cells. Survivin expression was increased in polyploid/senescent cells as analyzed by Western blotting. Increased survivin accumulated both in the nucleus and cytoplasm and dissociated with condensed DNA and mitotic spindle at the metaphase. Abnormal accumulation of survivin also rendered polyploid/senescent cells insensitive to cytotoxic activities of YM155, a DNA damaging agent with a suppressive effect on survivin gene transcription. AZD8055, a specific mTOR inhibitor, effectively prevented BMS-777607-induced polyploidy and senescence and restored survivin expression and its nuclear localization to normal levels. Although a synergism was not observed, BMS-777607 plus AZD8055 increased cancer cell sensitivity toward different cytotoxic chemotherapeutics. In conclusion, BMS-777607-induced chemoresistance is associated with cell polyploidy and senescence. Inhibition of mTOR signaling by AZD8055 prevents BMS-777607-induced polyploidy/senescence and increases breast cancer cell chemosensitivity.",

However, the mechanism by which ANG regulates plasmin formation and cell migration was not known. Our studies here detected elevated levels of secreted and cell surface-bound ANG in highly invasive metastatic breast cancer cells. ANG was also detected at very high levels in the tumor cells in infiltrating ductal carcinomas. By immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation analysis, ANG was detected at the leading edges of the cell surfaces where it colocalized and interacted with members of the plasminogen activation system (PAS) such as annexin A2 (A2), calpactin (S100-A10) and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR). Analysis of lipid raft (LR) and non-lipid raft (NLR) regions of the cell membranes showed the predominance of ANG, A2 and S100-A10 in the LR regions. In contrast, uPAR was detected predominantly in the NLR fractions, suggesting that ANG interacts with uPAR at the junctions of LR and NLR regions. ANG knockdown in T47D and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines did not affect the cellular expression of A2, S100-A10 and uPAR but decreased cell migration and plasmin formation. Neutralization of ANG with monoclonal antibodies similarly decreased the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. In the presence of ANG, uPAR was observed to interact with uPA, which is necessary for plasmin formation. Conversely, in the absence of ANG, uPAR did not interact with uPA and FAK and Src kinases were observed to be dephosphorylated. Exogenous addition of recombinant ANG to ANG knocked down MDA-MB-231 cells restored FAK phosphorylation, uPAR interactions with uPA, plasmin formation as well as migration of these cells. Taken together, our results identified a novel role for ANG as a member of the uPAR interactome that facilitates the interaction of uPAR with uPA, leading to plasmin formation and cell migration necessary for tumor invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells.",

We aimed to identify genes driven by the TP53 mutation status and assess their clinical relevance in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and ER-negative BC, and their potential as targets for patients with TP53 mutated tumors. Separate ROC analyses of each gene expression according to TP53 mutation status were performed. The prognostic value of genes with the highest AUC were assessed in a large dataset of untreated, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy treated patients. The mitotic checkpoint gene MPS1 was the most significant gene correlated with TP53 status, and the most significant prognostic marker in all ER-positive BC datasets. MPS1 retained its prognostic value independently from the type of treatment administered. The biological functions of MPS1 were investigated in different BC cell lines. We also assessed the effects of a potent small molecule inhibitor of MPS1, SP600125, alone and in combination with chemotherapy. Consistent with the gene expression profiling and siRNA assays, the inhibition of MPS1 by SP600125 led to a reduction in cell viability and a significant increase in cell death, selectively in TP53-mutated BC cells. Furthermore, the chemical inhibition of MPS1 sensitized BC cells to conventional chemotherapy, particularly taxanes. Our results collectively demonstrate that TP53-correlated kinase MPS1, is a potential therapeutic target in BC patients with TP53 mutated tumors, and that SP600125 warrant further development in future clinical trials.",

The HPV E6 oncoprotein has the ability to target and interfere with several PSD-95/DLG/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain-containing proteins that are involved in the control of cell polarity. This function can be significant for E6 oncogenic activity because a deficiency in cell polarisation is a marker of tumour progression. The establishment and control of polarity in epithelial cells depend on the correct asymmetrical distribution of proteins and lipids at the cell borders and on specialised cell junctions. In this report, we have investigated the effects of HPV E6 protein on the polarity machinery, with a focus on the PDZ partitioning defective 3 (Par3) protein, which is a key component of tight junctions (TJ) and the polarity network. We demonstrate that E6 is able to bind and induce the mislocalisation of Par3 protein in a PDZ-dependent manner without significant reduction in Par3 protein levels. In addition, the high-risk HPV-18 E6 protein promotes a delay in TJ formation when analysed by calcium switch assays. Taken together, the data presented in this study contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanism by which HPVs induce the loss of cell polarity, with potential implications for the development and progression of HPV-associated tumours.",

Selective ERK inhibitors have been proposed as alternative salvage therapies. We show that ERK inhibition is more potent than MEK inhibition at suppressing MAPK activity and inhibiting the proliferation of multiple BRAF inhibitor resistant melanoma cell models. Nevertheless, melanoma cells often failed to undergo apoptosis in response to ERK inhibition, because the relief of ERK-dependent negative feedback activated RAS and PI3K signalling. Consequently, the combination of ERK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition was effective at promoting cell death in all resistant melanoma cell models, and was substantially more potent than the MEK/PI3K/mTOR inhibitor combination. Our data indicate that a broader targeting strategy concurrently inhibiting ERK, rather than MEK, and PI3K/mTOR may circumvent BRAF inhibitor resistance, and should be considered during the clinical development of ERK inhibitors.",

TP53 (exons 4\u20138) was sequenced in 524 archived specimens of IALT patients with a median follow-up of 7.5 years.

Honokiol (HNK) is a natural phenolic compound isolated from an extract of seed cones from Magnolia grandiflora. Recent studies from our lab show that HNK impedes breast carcinogenesis. Here, we provide molecular evidence that HNK inhibits EMT in breast cancer cells resulting in significant downregulation of mesenchymal marker proteins and concurrent upregulation of epithelial markers. Experimental EMT induced by exposure to TGF\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in spontaneously immortalized nontumorigenic human mammary epithelial cells is also completely reversed by HNK as evidenced by morphological as well as molecular changes. Investigating the downstream mediator(s) that may direct EMT inhibition by HNK, we found functional interactions between HNK, Stat3, and EMT-signaling components. In\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo analyses show that HNK inhibits Stat3 activation in breast cancer cells and tumors. Constitutive activation of Stat3 abrogates HNK-mediated activation of epithelial markers whereas inhibition of Stat3 using small molecule inhibitor, Stattic, potentiates HNK-mediated inhibition of EMT markers, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, HNK inhibits recruitment of Stat3 on mesenchymal transcription factor Zeb1 promoter resulting in decreased Zeb1 expression and nuclear translocation. We also discover that HNK increases E-cadherin expression via Stat3-mediated release of Zeb1 from E-cadherin promoter. Collectively, this study reports that HNK effectively inhibits EMT in breast cancer cells and provide evidence for a previously unrecognized cross-talk between HNK and Stat3/Zeb1/E-cadherin axis.",

In the present study, we have analyzed the effects of Curcumin on miRNA expression and its correlation to the anti-tumorigenic properties of this natural occurring polyphenol.Using microarray miRNA expression analyses, we show here that Curcumin modulates the expression of a series of miRNAs, including miR181b, in metastatic breast cancer cells. Interestingly, we found that miR181b down-modulates CXCL1 and -2 through a direct binding to their 3\u2032-UTR. Overexpression or inhibition of miR181b in metastatic breast cancer cells has a significant impact on CXCL1 and -2 and is required for the effect of Curcumin on these two cytokines. miR181b also mediates the effects of Curcumin on inhibition of proliferation and invasion as well as induction of apoptosis. Importantly, over-expression of miR181b in metastatic breast cancer cells inhibits metastasis formation in\u00a0vivo in immunodeficient mice. Finally, we demonstrated that Curcumin up-regulates miR181b and down-regulates CXCL1 and -2 in cells isolated from several primary human breast cancers.Taken together, these data show that Curcumin provides a simple bridge to bring metastamir modulation into the clinic, placing it in a primary and tertiary preventive, as well as a therapeutic, setting.",

By phosphorylating S387 in procaspase-8 Cdk1/cyclin B1 generates a phospho-epitope for the binding of the PBD of Plk1. Subsequently, S305 in procaspase-8 is phosphorylated by Plk1 during mitosis. Using an RNAi-based strategy we could demonstrate that the extrinsic cell death is increased upon Fas-stimulation when endogenous caspase-8 is replaced by a mutant (S305A) mimicking the non-phosphorylated form. Together, our data show that sequential phosphorylation by Cdk1/cyclin B1 and Plk1 decreases the sensitivity of cells toward stimuli of the extrinsic pathway during mitosis.

In this study, we describe the first use of a high-throughput digital system to assay the expression of genes in an \u201cultra-high risk\u201d microarray classifier in FFPE high-risk neuroblastoma tumors. Customized probes corresponding to the 42 genes in a published multi-gene neuroblastoma signature were hybridized to RNA isolated from 107 FFPE high-risk neuroblastoma samples using the NanoString nCounter\u2122 Analysis System. For classification of each patient, the Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between the standardized nCounter\u2122 data and the molecular signature from the microarray data. We demonstrate that the nCounter\u2122 42-gene panel sub-stratified the high-risk cohort into two subsets with statistically significantly different overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0027) and event-free survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028).

This study was conducted to investigate REarranged during Transfection (RET) gene promoter CpG island methylation as a possible prognostic marker for TNM stage II CRC patients.The utility of RET promoter CpG island methylation in tumors of stage II CRC patients as a prognostic biomarker for CRC related death was studied in three independent series (including 233, 231, and 294 TNM stage II patients, respectively) by using MSP and pyrosequencing. The prognostic value of RET promoter CpG island methylation was analyzed by using Cox regression analysis.In the first series, analyzed by MSP, CRC stage II patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0233) with RET methylated tumors had a significantly worse overall survival as compared to those with unmethylated tumors (HRmultivariable\u00a0=\u00a02.51, 95%-CI: 1.42\u20134.43). Despite a significant prognostic effect of RET methylation in stage III patients of a second series, analyzed by MSP, the prognostic effect in stage II patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0231) was not statistically significant (HRmultivariable\u00a0=\u00a01.16, 95%-CI 0.71\u20131.92).

Our results show that RET promoter CpG island methylation, analyzed by two different techniques, is associated with a poor prognosis in stage II CRC in two independent series and a poor prognosis in stage III CRC in one series. RET methylation may serve as a useful and robust tool for clinical practice to identify high-risk stage II CRC patients with a poor prognosis. This merits further investigation.",

     "abstract": "Bone metastasis represents one of the most deleterious clinical consequences arising in the context of many solid tumors. Severe osteolysis results from tumor cell colonization of the bone compartment, a process which entails reciprocal exchange of soluble signals between tumor cells and their osseous microenvironment. Recent evidence indicates that tumor-intrinsic miRNAs are pleiotropic regulators of gene expression. But they are also frequently released in exosome-like vesicles (ELV). Yet the functional relevance of the transference of tumor-derived ELV and their miRNA cargo to the extracellular milieu during osseous colonization is unknown.Comparative transcriptomic profiling using an in\u00a0vivo murine model of bone metastasis identified a repressed miRNA signature associated with high prometastatic activity. Forced expression of single miRNAs identified miR-192 that markedly appeased osseous metastasis in\u00a0vivo, as shown by X-ray, bioluminescence imaging and microCT scans. Histological examination of metastatic lesions revealed impaired tumor-induced angiogenesis in\u00a0vivo, an effect that was associated in\u00a0vitro with decreased hallmarks of angiogenesis. Isolation and characterization of ELV by flow cytometry, Western blot analysis, transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed the ELV cargo enrichment in miR-192. Consistent with these findings, fluorescent labeled miR-192-enriched-ELV showed the in\u00a0vitro transfer and release of miR-192 in target endothelial cells and abrogation of the angiogenic program by repression of proangiogenic IL-8, ICAM and CXCL1. Moreover, in\u00a0vivo infusion of fluorescent labeled ELV efficiently targeted cells of the osseous compartment. Furthermore, treatment with miR-192 enriched ELV in a model of in\u00a0vivo bone metastasis pre-conditioned osseous milieu and impaired tumor-induced angiogenesis, thereby reducing the metastatic burden and tumor colonization.Changes in the miRNA-cargo content within ELV represent a novel mechanism heavily influencing bone metastatic colonization, which is most likely relevant in other target organs. Mechanistic mimicry of this phenomenon by synthetic nanoparticles could eventually emerge as a novel therapeutic approach.",

However, the excise mechanism of hTERT regulation during carcinogenesis is not well understood. In this study, we discovered cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4 (CPSF4) as a novel tumor-specific hTERT promoter-regulating protein in lung cancer cells and identified the roles of CPSF4 in regulating lung hTERT and lung cancer growth. The ectopic overexpression of CPSF4 upregulated the hTERT promoter-driven report gene expression and activated the endogenous hTERT mRNA and protein expression and the telomerase activity in lung cancer cells and normal lung cells. In contrast, the knockdown of CPSF4 by siRNA had the opposite effects. CPSF4 knockdown also significantly inhibited tumor cell growth in lung cancer cells in\u00a0vitro and in a xenograft mouse model in\u00a0vivo, and this inhibitory effect was partially mediated by decreasing the expression of hTERT. High expression of both CPSF4 and hTERT proteins were detected in lung adenocarcinoma cells by comparison with the normal lung cells. Tissue microarray immunohistochemical analysis of lung adenocarcinomas also revealed a strong positive correlation between the expression of CPSF4 and hTERT proteins. Moreover, Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that patients with high levels of CPSF4 and hTERT expression had a significantly shorter overall survival than those with low CPSF4 and hTERT expression levels. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CPSF4 plays a critical role in the regulation of hTERT expression and lung tumorigenesis and may be a new prognosis factor in lung adenocarcinomas.",

RNA was profiled on Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays. We used probe-set-wise hierarchical models to evaluate the effect of preservation method on transcript expression and linear mixed effects models to assess the effect of cold ischemic delay on the expression of individual probe sets. Gene set enrichment analysis identified pathways overrepresented in the affected transcripts. We combined the levels of 41 most sensitive transcripts to develop an index of ischemic stress.Concordance in global gene expression between the baseline and 40\u00a0min delay was higher for samples preserved in RNAlater (average concordance correlation coefficient CCC\u00a0=\u00a00.92 compared to 0.88 for snap frozen). Overall, 481 transcripts (3%) were significantly affected by the preservation method, most of them involved in processes important in cancer. Prolonged cold ischemic delay of up to 3\u00a0h induced marginal global gene expression changes (average CCC\u00a0=\u00a00.90 between baseline and 3\u00a0h delay). However 41 transcripts were significantly affected by cold ischemic delay. Among the induced transcripts were stress response genes, apoptotic response genes; among the downregulated were genes involved in metabolism, protein processing and cell cycle regulation. An index combining the expression levels of these genes was proportional to the cold ischemic delay.Prolonged cold ischemia induces significant transcriptional changes in a small subset of transcripts in the tissue. Furthermore, the expression level of about 3% of the transcripts is affected by the preservation method. These sensitive transcripts should not be included in genomic signatures for more reliable analytical performance.",

In particular, mutation of tyrosine 720 in FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 or PDGFR\u03b1D842V inhibited cell growth and blocked ERK signaling in Ba/F3 cells. This mutation also decreased myeloproliferation in transplanted mice and the proliferation of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors transduced with FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1. We showed that the non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 bound directly to tyrosine 720 of FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1. SHP2 knock-down decreased proliferation of Ba/F3 cells transformed with FIP1L1-PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b1D842V and affected ERK signaling, but not STAT5 phosphorylation. Remarkably, SHP2 was not essential for cell proliferation and ERK phosphorylation induced by the wild-type PDGF receptor in response to ligand stimulation, suggesting a shift in the function of SHP2 downstream of oncogenic receptors.In conclusion, our results indicate that SHP2 is required for cell transformation and ERK activation by mutant PDGF receptors.",

It is unclear however, whether a less demanding assessment of cell division rate (as determined in clinical setting by expression of Ki67) can function in place of gene profiling.We investigated agreement between literature-, distribution-based, as well as signature-derived values for Ki67, relative to the genomic grade index (GGI), 70-gene signature, p53 signature, recurrence score (RS), and the molecular subtype models of Sorlie, Hu, and Parker in representative sets of 253 and 159 breast cancers with a median follow-up of 13 and 14.5 years, respectively. The relevance for breast cancer specific survival was also addressed in uni- and bivariate Cox models.Taking both cohorts into account, our broad approach identified ROC optimized Ki67 cutoffs in the range of 8\u201328%. With optimum signature-reproducing cutoffs, similarity in classification of individual tumors was higher for binary signatures (72\u201385%), than multi-level signatures (67\u201373%). Consistent with strong agreement, no prognostic superiority was noted for either Ki67 or the binary GGI, 70-gene and p53 signatures in the Uppsala dataset by bivariate analyses. In contrast, Ki67-independent prognostic capacity could be demonstrated for RS and molecular subtypes according to Sorlie, Hu and Parker in both datasets.Our results show that the added prognostic value of binary proliferation-related gene signatures is limited for Ki67-assessed breast cancers.

In this study, we sought to evaluate the impact of the malignant phenotype-associated glycan, sialyl-Tn (STn) in the function of the key orchestrators of the immune response, the dendritic cells (DCs). In high grade bladder cancer tissue, the STn antigen is significantly overexpressed and correlated with the increased expression of ST6GALNAC1 sialyltransferase. Bladder cancer tissue presenting elevated expression of ST6GALNAC1 showed a correlation with increased expression of CD1a, a marker for bladder immature DCs and showed concomitant low levels of Th1-inducing cytokines IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1. In\u00a0vitro, human DCs co-incubated with STn+ bladder cancer cells, had an immature phenotype (MHC-IIlow, CD80low and CD86low) and were unresponsive to further maturation stimuli. When contacting with STn+ cancer cells, DCs expressed significantly less IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1. Consistent with a tolerogenic DC profile, T cells that were primed by DCs pulsed with antigens derived from STn+ cancer cells were not activated and showed a FoxP3high IFN-\u03b3low phenotype. Blockade of STn antigens and of STn+ glycoprotein, CD44 and MUC1, in STn+ cancer cells was able to lower the induction of tolerance and DCs become more mature.Overall, our data suggest that STn-expressing cancer cells impair DC maturation and endow DCs with a tolerogenic function, limiting their capacity to trigger protective anti-tumour T cell responses. STn antigens and, in particular, STn+ glycoproteins are potential targets for circumventing tumour-induced tolerogenic mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "In early breast cancer, local relapses represent a determinant and not simply an indicator of risk for distant relapse and death. Notably, 90% of local recurrences occur at or close to the same quadrant of the primary cancer. Relevance of PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K signaling in breast tumorigenesis is very well documented. However, the pathway/s involved in the process of breast cancer local relapse are not well understood. The ribosomal protein p70S6K has been implicated in breast cancer cell response to post-surgical inflammation, supporting the hypothesis that it may be crucial also for breast cancer recurrence. Here, we show that p70S6K activity is required for the survival of breast cancer cells challenged in \u201chostile\u201d microenvironments. We found that impairment of p70S6K activity in breast cancer cells strongly decreased their tumor take rate in nude mice. In line with this observation, if cells were challenged to grow in anchorage independence or in clonogenic assay, growth of colonies was strongly dependent on an intact p70S6K signaling. This in\u00a0vitro finding was particularly evident when breast cancer cells were grown in the presence of wound fluids harvested following surgery from breast cancer patients, suggesting that the stimuli present in the post-surgical setting at least partially relied on activity of p70S6K to stimulate breast cancer relapse. From a mechanistic point of view, our results indicated that p70S6K signaling was able to activate Gli1 and up-regulate the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2, thereby activating a survival response in breast cancer cells challenged in hostile settings. Our work highlights a previously poorly recognized function of p70S6K in preserving breast cancer cell survival, which could eventually be responsible for local relapse and opens the way to the design of new and more specific therapies aiming to restrain the deleterious effects of wound response.",

     "abstract": "Chromosomal instability is a hallmark of human cancer cells, but its role in carcinogenesis remains poorly resolved. Insights into this role have emerged from studies on the tumour suppressor BRCA2, whose inactivation in human cancers causes chromosomal instability through the loss of essential functions of the BRCA2 protein in the normal mechanisms responsible for the replication, repair and segregation of DNA during cell division. Humans who carry heterozygous germline mutations in the BRCA2 gene are highly predisposed to cancers of the breast, ovary, pancreas, prostate and other tissues. Here, we review recent studies that describe genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) for pancreatic cancer associated with BRCA2 mutations. These studies not only surprisingly show that BRCA2 does not follow the classical Knudson \u201ctwo hit\u201d paradigm for tumour suppression, but also highlight features of the interplay between TP53 inactivation and carcinogenesis in the context of BRCA2 deficiency. Thus, the models reveal novel aspects of cancer evolution in carriers of germline BRCA2 mutations, provide new insights into the tumour suppressive role of BRCA2, and establish valuable new preclinical settings for testing approaches to pancreatic cancer therapy; together, these features emphasize the value of GEMMs in cancer research.",

COX2 expression is reported in epithelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages and endothelial cells of Apc+/\u2212 mouse polyps. However, the cell type(s) in which COX2 expression is required for Apc+/\u2212 tumor induction is not known. To address this question, we developed ApcMin/+ mice in which the Cox2 gene is specifically deleted either in intestinal epithelial cells or in myeloid cells. There is no significant difference in intestinal polyp number between ApcMin/+ mice with a targeted Cox2 gene deletion in myeloid cells and their control littermate ApcMin/+ mice. In contrast, ApcMin/+ mice with a targeted Cox2 deletion in intestinal epithelial cells have reduced intestinal tumorigenesis when compared to their littermate control ApcMin/+ mice. However, two gender-specific effects are notable. First, female ApcMin/+ mice developed more intestinal tumors than male ApcMin/+ mice. Second, targeted intestinal epithelial cell Cox2 deletion decreased tumorigenesis in female, but not in male, ApcMin/+ mice. Considered in the light of pharmacologic studies and studies with global Cox2 gene knockout mice, our data suggest that (i) intrinsic COX2 expression in intestinal epithelial cells plays a gender-specific role in tumor development in ApcMin/+ mice, and (ii) COX2 expression in cell type(s) other than intestinal epithelial cells also modulates intestinal tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice, by a paracrine process.",

     "abstract": "It has been suggested that cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) positioned at the desmoplastic areas of various types of cancer are capable of executing a migratory program, characterized by accelerated motility and collective configuration. Since CAFs are reprogrammed derivatives of normal progenitors, including quiescent fibroblasts, we hypothesized that such migratory program could be context-dependent, thus being regulated by specific paracrine signals from the adjacent cancer population. Using the traditional scratch assay setup, we showed that only specific colon cancer cell lines (i.e. HT29) were able to induce collective CAF migration. By performing quantitative proteomics (SILAC), we identified a 2.7-fold increase of claudin-11, a member of the tight junction apparatus, in CAFs that exerted such collectivity in their migratory pattern. Further proteomic investigations of cancer cell line secretomes revealed a specific signature, involving TGF-\u03b2, as potential mediator of this effect. Normal colonic fibroblasts stimulated with TGF-\u03b2 exerted myofibroblastic differentiation, occludin (OCLN) and claudin-11 (CLDN11) overexpression and cohort formation. Subsequently, inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 attenuated all the previous effects.

Clinical recurrence is often associated with the emergence of metastasis and treatment resistance. The purpose of this study was to identify genes with high prometastatic activity which could potentially account for treatment resistance.Global transcriptomic profiling was performed by robust microarray analysis in highly metastatic subpopulations. Extensive in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo functional studies were achieved by overexpression and by silencing gene expression.We identified the small GTPase RHOB as a gene that promotes early and late stages of metastasis in ADC. Gene silencing of RHOB prevented metastatic activity in a systemic murine model of bone metastasis. These effects were highly dependent on tumor-host interactions. Clinical analysis revealed a marked association between high RHOB levels and poor survival. Consistently, high RHOB levels promote metastasis progression, taxane-chemoresistance, and contribute to the survival advantage to \u03b3-irradiation. We postulate that RHOB belongs to a novel class of \u201cgenes of recurrence\u201d that have a dual role in metastasis and treatment resistance.",

Because of this, Notch is often upregulated in cancer and current efforts point to developing drugs that block its activation. Notch receptor endocytosis towards acidic compartments is a recently appreciated determinant of signaling activation. Vacuolar H+ ATPase (V-ATPase) is responsible for acidification of endocytic organelles and mutants in V-ATPase subunit encoding genes in model organisms have been recently shown to display loss of Notch signaling. Here, we show that administration of BafilomycinA1 (BafA1), a highly specific V-ATPase inhibitor decreases Notch signaling during Drosophila and Zebrafish development, and in human cells in culture. In normal breast cells, we find that BafA1 treatment leads to accumulation of Notch in the endo-lysosomal system, and reduces its processing and signaling activity. In Notch-addicted breast cancer cells, BafA1 treatment reduces growth in cells expressing membrane tethered forms of Notch, while sparing cells expressing cytoplasmic forms. In contrast, we find that V-ATPase inhibition reduces growth of leukemia cells, without affecting Notch activatory cleavage. However, consistent with the emerging roles of V-ATPase in controlling multiple signaling pathways, in these cells Akt activation is reduced, as it is also the case in BafA1-treated breast cancer cells. Our data support V-ATPase inhibition as a novel therapeutic approach to counteract tumor growth via signaling pathways regulated at the endo-lysosomal level.",

We report the molecular cloning and functional characterization of a novel FGFR1OP (exon 11)-RET (exon 11) gene fusion event (named FGFR1OP-RET), mediated by a reciprocal translocation t(6; 10)(q27; q11), in a patient affected by primary myelofibrosis (PMF) with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

Also, in EGFR-overexpressing Type I and II ovarian and breast cancer cell lines respectively, ERK 1/2 remain active only during the interphase. During this period, pERK 1/2 could inhibit Trail-induced apoptosis, most effectively during the G1/S phase. By knocking-down the endogenous pro-Caspase-8 using RNAi and replacing it with its non-phosphorylatable counterpart (S387A), a significant increase in Caspase-8 activity upon Trail stimulation was observed, even in the presence of pERK 1/2. Taken together, we propose that a combination of Trail and an inhibitor of ERK 1/2 activities could potentially enhance of Trail's effectiveness as an anti-cancer agent in ERK 1/2 hyperactive cancer cells.",

These lesions resemble mouse skin tumors induced by the two-stage DMBA/TPA skin carcinogenesis protocol; in this protocol BRAFi accelerates tumor induction. Since prior studies demonstrated cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is necessary for DMBA/TPA tumor induction, we hypothesized that COX-2 inhibition might prevent BRAFi-accelerated skin tumors. Celecoxib, a COX-2 inhibitor, significantly delayed tumor acceleration by the BRAFi inhibitor PLX7420 and decreased tumor number by 90%. Tumor gene expression profiling demonstrated that celecoxib partially reversed the PLX4720-induced gene signature. In PDV cuSCC cells, vemurafenib (a clinically approved BRAFi) increased ERK phosphorylation and soft agar colony formation; both responses were greatly decreased by celecoxib. In clinical trials trametinib, a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) increases BRAFi therapy efficacy in BRAFV600E melanomas and reduces BRAFi-induced KA and cuSCC frequency. Trametinib also reduced vemurafenib-induced PDV soft agar colonies, but less efficiently than celecoxib. The trametinb/celecoxib combination was more effective than either inhibitor alone. In conclusion, celecoxib suppressed both BRAFi-accelerated skin tumors and soft-agar colonies, warranting its testing as a chemopreventive agent for non-melanoma skin lesions in patients treated with BRAFi alone or in combination with MEKi.",

Here we evaluate the synergy of pharmacologically affecting both of these critical pathways using the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus and the histone deacetylase inhibitor entinostat. A dose-matrix screening approach found this combination to be highly active and synergistic in a panel of genetically diverse human MM cell lines. Synergy and activity was observed in mouse PCT and human BL and MCL cell lines tested in\u00a0vitro, as well as in freshly isolated primary MM patient samples tested ex\u00a0vivo. This combination had minimal effects on healthy donor cells and retained activity when tested in a co-culture system simulating the protective interaction of cancer cells with the tumor microenvironment. Combining sirolimus with entinostat enhanced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. At the molecular level, entinostat increased the expression of cell cycle negative regulators including CDKN1A (p21) and CDKN2A (p16), while the combination decreased critical growth and survival effectors including Cyclin D, BCL-XL, BIRC5, and activated MAPK.",

Some variants are only associated with particular clinical subtypes of breast cancer. Understanding how and why these variants influence subtype-specific cancer risk contributes to our understanding of cancer etiology. We conducted a genome-wide expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) study in a discovery set of 287 breast tumors and 97 normal mammary tissue samples and a replication set of 235 breast tumors. We found that the risk-associated allele of rs7716600 in the 5p12 estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) susceptibility locus was associated with elevated expression of the nearby gene MRPS30 exclusively in ER-positive tumors. We replicated this finding in 235 independent tumors. Further, we showed the rs7716600 risk genotype was associated with decreased MRPS30 promoter methylation exclusively in ER-positive breast tumors. In\u00a0vitro studies in MCF-7 cells carrying the protective genotype showed that estrogen stimulation decreased MRPS30 promoter chromatin availability and mRNA levels. In contrast, in 600MPE cells carrying the risk genotype, estrogen increased MRPS30 expression and did not affect promoter availability. Our data suggest the 5p12 risk allele affects MRPS30 expression in estrogen-responsive tumor cells after tumor initiation by a mechanism affecting chromatin availability. These studies emphasize that the genetic architecture of breast cancer is context-specific, and integrated analysis of gene expression and chromatin remodeling in normal and tumor tissues will be required to explain the mechanisms of risk alleles.",

We found that ectopic expression of RhoGDI\u03b1 resulted in marked inhibition of an anchorage-independent growth with induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, while point mutation of RhoGDI\u03b1 SUMOylation at residue Lys-138 (K138R) abrogated this growth suppression and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in cancer cells. Further studies showed that SUMOylation at Lys-138 was critical for RhoGDI\u03b1 down-regulation of cyclin D1 protein expression and that MEK1/2-Erk was a specific downstream target of SUMOylated RhoGDI\u03b1 for its inhibition of C-Jun/AP-1 cascade, cyclin d1 transcription, and cell cycle progression. These results strongly demonstrate that SUMOylated RhoGDI\u03b1 suppressed C-Jun/AP-1-dependent transactivation specifically via targeting MEK1/2-Erk, subsequently leading to the down-regulation of cyclin D1 expression and anti-cancer activity.

The genetic modification through a lentiviral vector did not affect the intrinsic cytolytic activity of NK-92MI toward human erythroleukemic cell line K562 cells or CD138-negative targets. However, these retargeted NK-92MI (NK-92MI-scFv) displayed markedly enhanced cytotoxicity against CD138-positive human MM cell lines (RPMI8226, U266 and NCI-H929) and primary MM cells at various effector-to-target ratios (E:T) as compared to the empty vector-transfected NK-92MI (NK-92MI-mock). In line with the enhanced cytotoxicity of NK-92MI-scFv, significant elevations in the secretion of granzyme B, interferon-\u03b3 and proportion of CD107a expression were also found in NK-92MI-scFv in response to CD138-positive targets compared with NK-92MI-mock. Most importantly, the enhancement in the cytotoxicity of NK-92MI-scFv did not attenuate with 10Gy-irradiation that sufficiently blocked cell proliferation. Moreover, the irradiated NK-92MI-scFv exerted definitely intensified anti-tumor activity toward CD138-positive MM cells than NK-92MI-mock in the xenograft NOD-SCID mouse model.

Human metastatic, androgen-independent C4-2 prostate cancer cells and NOD-SCID mice bearing PTEN-deficient, metastatic and PSA-secreting, patient-derived subrenal capsule LTL-313H prostate cancer tissue xenografts were treated with docetaxel and Aneustat, alone and in combination.

Complete growth inhibition and shrinkage of the xenografts could be obtained with the combined drugs as distinct from the drugs on their own.

The aberrant overexpression of CEA on adenocarcinoma cells correlates with their increased metastatic potential.

In this study, we demonstrate that the IgV-like N terminal domain of CEA directly participates in the implantation of cancer cells through its homotypic and heterotypic binding properties. Specifically, we determined that the recombinant N terminal domain of CEA directly binds to fibronectin (Fn) with a dissociation constant in the nanomolar range (KD 16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0nM) and interacts with itself (KD 100\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0nM) and more tightly to the IgC-like A3 domain (KD 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0nM). Disruption of these molecular associations through the addition of antibodies specific to the CEA N or A3B3 domains, or by adding soluble recombinant forms of the CEA N, A3 or A3B3 domains or a peptide corresponding to residues 108\u2013115 of CEA resulted in the inhibition of CEA-mediated intercellular aggregation and adherence events in\u00a0vitro. Finally, pretreating CEA-expressing murine colonic carcinoma cells (MC38.CEA) with rCEA N, A3 or A3B3 modules blocked their implantation and the establishment of tumor foci in\u00a0vivo.

The SERPINA5 was reported to be deregulated in renal, breast, prostate and ovarian cancers. However, the roles of SERPINA5 in cancer remain greatly elusive. In this study, we found that the DNA dosage and expression level of the SERPINA5 gene were significantly decreased in HCC by quantitative real-time PCR. Notably, the expression levels of SERPINA5 negatively correlated with malignant progression of HCC. The SERPINA5 gene was further observed to reduce in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo metastatic potential of HCC cells. Moreover, secreted SERPINA5 protein also could inhibit the metastatic ability of HCC cells. Finally, we discovered that one of the mechanisms explaining SERPINA5 inhibition of HCC metastasis is through direct interaction with fibronectin and disruption of the fibronectin\u2013integrin signaling pathway. These findings highlight an important role of SERPINA5 in the regulation of migratory and metastatic potentials of HCC and suggest a potential application of SERPINA5 in cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "In clinical practice, targeted therapies are usually administered together with chemotherapeutics. However, little is known whether conventional cytotoxic agents enhance the efficacy of targeted compounds, and whether a possible synergy would be dictated by drug-sensitizing genetic alterations. To explore these issues, we leveraged the design of clinical studies in humans to conduct a multi-arm trial in an \u2018in-cell\u2019 format. Using the MET oncogene as a model target and a panel of genetically characterized cell lines as a reference population, we found that two different chemotherapeutic regimens \u2013 cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil \u2013 exerted widespread cytotoxic activity that was not further enhanced by MET inhibition with a monovalent anti-MET antibody. From a complementary perspective, targeted MET inhibition was successful in a selected complement of cells harboring MET genomic lesions. In this latter setting, addition of chemotherapy did not provide a therapeutic advantage. Mechanistically, chemotherapeutics did not influence the basal activity of MET in cells with normal MET genomic status nor did they contribute to neutralize MET signals in cells with MET amplification. These data suggest that tumors displaying MET aberrations achieve plateau responses by MET monotherapy and do not receive further benefit by addition of cytotoxic treatments.",

     "abstract": "Proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1 (PELP1) is a proto-oncogene that functions as coactivator of the estrogen receptor and is an independent prognostic predictor of shorter survival of breast cancer patients. The dysregulation of PELP1 in breast cancer has been implicated in oncogenesis, metastasis, and therapy resistance. Although several aspects of PELP1 have been studied, a complete list of PELP1 target genes remains unknown, and the molecular mechanisms of PELP1 mediated oncogenesis remain elusive. In this study, we have performed a whole genome analysis to profile the PELP1 transcriptome by RNA-sequencing and identified 318 genes as PELP1 regulated genes. Pathway analysis revealed that PELP1 modulates several pathways including the molecular mechanisms of cancer, estrogen signaling, and breast cancer progression. Interestingly, RNA-seq analysis also revealed that PELP1 regulates the expression of several genes involved in alternative splicing. Accordingly, the PELP1 regulated genome includes several uniquely spliced isoforms. Mechanistic studies show that PELP1 binds RNA with a preference to poly-C, co-localizes with the splicing factor SC35 at nuclear speckles, and participates in alternative splicing. Further, PELP1 interacts with the arginine methyltransferase PRMT6 and modifies PRMT6 functions. Inhibition of PRMT6 reduced PELP1-mediated estrogen receptor activation, cellular proliferation, and colony formation. PELP1 and PRMT6 are co-recruited to estrogen receptor target genes, PELP1 knockdown affects the enrichment of histone H3R2 di-methylation, and PELP1 and PRMT6 coordinate to regulate the alternative splicing of genes involved in cancer. Collectively, our data suggest that PELP1 oncogenic functions involve alternative splicing leading to the activation of unique pathways that support tumor progression and that the PELP1\u2013PRMT6 axis may be a potential target for breast cancer therapy.",

Gene expression profiling has uncovered the transcription factor LIM homeobox gene 2 (Lhx2) with up-regulated expression during TGF\u03b2-induced EMT in normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells. Loss and gain of function experiments in transgenic mouse models of breast cancer and of insulinoma in\u00a0vivo and in breast cancer cells in\u00a0vitro indicate that Lhx2 plays a critical role in primary tumor growth and metastasis. Notably, the transgenic expression of Lhx2 during breast carcinogenesis promotes vessel maturation, primary tumor growth, tumor cell intravasation and metastasis by directly inducing the expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B in tumor cells and by indirectly increasing the expression of PDGF receptor-\u03b2 (PDGFR\u03b2) on tumor cells and pericytes. Pharmacological inhibition of PDGF-B/PDGFR\u03b2 signaling reduces vessel functionality and tumor growth and Lhx2-induced cell migration and cell invasion. The data indicate a dual role of Lhx2 during EMT and tumor progression: by inducing the expression of PDGF-B, Lhx2 provokes an autocrine PDGF-B/PDGFR\u03b2 loop required for cell migration, invasion and metastatic dissemination and paracrine PDGF-B/PDGFR\u03b2 signaling to support blood vessel functionality and, thus, primary tumor growth.",

MicroRNAs could represent putative target molecules, considering their role in tumorigenesis, cancer progression and their specific tissue expression. Although several studies have tried to identify microRNA signature for glioblastoma, a microRNA profile is still far from being well-defined.In this work the expression of 19 microRNAs (miR-7, miR-9, miR-9\u2217, miR-10a, miR-10b, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-21, miR-26a, miR-27a, miR-31, miR-34a, miR-101, miR-137, miR-182, miR-221, miR-222, miR-330, miR-519d) was evaluated in sixty formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded glioblastoma samples using a locked nucleic acid real-time PCR. Moreover, a comparison of miRNA expressions was performed between primary brain neoplasias of different grades (grades IV\u2013I).The analysis of 14 validated miRNA expression in the 60 glioblastomas, using three different non-neoplastic references as controls, revealed a putative miRNA signature: mir-10b and miR-21 were up-regulated, while miR-7, miR-31, miR-101, miR-137, miR-222 and miR-330 were down-regulated in glioblastomas. Comparing miRNA expression between glioblastoma group and gliomas of grades I\u2013III, 3 miRNAs (miR-10b, mir-34a and miR-101) showed different regulation statuses between high-grade and low-grade tumors. miR-10b was up-regulated in high grade and significantly down-regulated in low-grade gliomas, suggesting that could be a candidate for a GBM target therapy.This study provides further data for the identification of a miRNA profile for glioblastoma and suggests that different-grade neoplasia could be characterized by different expression of specific miRNAs.",

We have established a collection of 20 breast PDXs and characterized their biological and clinical features, as well as their genetic stability. While most PDXs originated from triple negative breast cancers (70%), our collection comprised five ER\u00a0+\u00a0cases (25%). Remarkably, the tumors that produced PDXs derived from a subset of aggressive breast cancers with a high proportion of grade 3 tumors and reduced recurrence-free survival. Consistent with this, we found significant differences between the transcriptomic signatures of tumors that produced a PDX (Take) and those that did not (No Take). The PDXs faithfully recapitulate the histological features of their primary tumors, and retain an excellent conservation of molecular classification assignment and Copy Number Change (CNC). Furthermore, the CNC profiles of different PDXs established from the same tumor overlap significantly. However, a small fraction of CNCs in the primary tumor that correspond to oligoclonal events were gradually lost during sequential passaging, suggesting that the PDXs' genetic structure eventually stabilizes around a dominant clone present in the tumor of origin. Finally, de novo occurring genetic events covering up to 9% of the genome were found in only a minority of the PDXs, showing that PDXs have limited genetic instability. These data show that breast cancer PDXs represent a subset of aggressive tumors prone to relapse, and that despite of an excellent conservation of original features, they remain genetically dynamic elements.",

     "abstract": "The HER2 oncogene targeting drug trastuzumab shows remarkable efficacy in patients overexpressing HER2. However acquired or primary resistance develops in most of the treated patients why alternative treatment strategies are strongly needed. As endosomal sorting and recycling are crucial steps for HER2 activity and the vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) is an important regulator of endocytotic trafficking, we proposed that targeting V-ATPase opens a new therapeutic strategy against trastuzumab-resistant tumor cells in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. V-ATPase inhibition with archazolid, a novel inhibitor of myxobacterial origin, results in growth inhibition, apoptosis and impaired HER2 pro-survival signaling of the trastuzumab-resistant cell line JIMT-1. This is accompanied by a decreased expression on the plasma membrane and accumulation of HER2 in the cytosol, where it colocalizes with endosomes, lysosomes and autophagosomes. Importantly, microscopic analysis of JIMT-1 xenograft tumor tissue of archazolid treated mice confirms the defect in HER2-recycling which leads to reduced tumor growth. These results suggest that V-ATPase inhibition by archazolid induces apoptosis and inhibits growth of trastuzumab-resistant tumor cells by retaining HER2 in dysfunctional vesicles of the recycling pathway and consequently abrogates HER2-signaling in\u00a0vitro as well as in\u00a0vivo. V-ATPase inhibition is thus suggested as a promising strategy for treatment of trastuzumab-resistant tumors.",

The primary tumors of the patients enrolled in this study offered a unique opportunity to identify biomarkers that could predict durable clinical benefit from CT-free anti-HER2 therapy.Patients with HER2-positive MBC were randomized to trastuzumab or lapatinib as first-line therapy. CT was added to anti-HER2 therapy in patients failing to achieve tumor regression at the 8-week evaluation and in those progressing at any time. Expression analysis of 105 selected genes was performed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary tumor samples. The research-based PAM50 intrinsic subtypes were also identified. Additionally, quantitative HER2 (H2T) and p95HER2 (p95) protein expression were evaluated by HERmark\u00ae and VeraTag\u00ae assay, respectively. Predictors of persistence on protocol (PP) were studied by Cox univariate and multivariate analysis.Nineteen patients were enrolled. Median overall survival was 43 months and median PP was 3.8 months (0.8\u201338.8+), with 4 patients (21.1%) persisting on single agent trastuzumab or lapatinib for longer than 12\u00a0mo (14.9\u201338.8\u00a0+\u00a0mo). Seventeen patients were evaluable for PP. Gene expression analysis revealed that high expression of the 17q12-21 amplicon genes HER2 and GRB7, and the PAM50 HER2-enriched intrinsic profile, were significantly associated with longer PP. Conversely, high expression of luminal-related genes such as PGR, MDM2 or PIK3CA, or the PAM50 luminal intrinsic profile correlated with reduced PP. Moreover, increasing H2T/p95 ratio was found to be significantly associated with longer PP (HR 0.56 per 2-fold increase in H2T/p95, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0015).Our data suggest that patients belonging to the \u201cHER2-enriched\u201d subtype and/or having high H2T/p95 protein expression ratio are exquisitely sensitive to anti-HER2 agents.

     "abstract": "Dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) and the transcription factor NF-\u03baB are implicated in prostate cancer since their expression levels are altered along this disease, although there are no evidences up to date demonstrating a crosstalk between them. In this report, we show for the first time that DUSP1 over-expression in DU145 cells promotes apoptosis and decreases NF-\u03baB activity by blocking p65/NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation. Moreover, although DUSP1 impairs TNF-\u03b1-induced p38 MAPK and JNK activation, only the specific inhibition of p38 MAPK exerts the same effects than DUSP1 over-expression on both apoptosis and NF-\u03baB activity. Consistently, DUSP1 promotes apoptosis and decreases NF-\u03baB activity in cells in which p38 MAPK is induced by TNF-\u03b1 treatment. These results demonstrate that p38 MAPK is specifically involved in DUSP1-mediated effects on both apoptosis and NF-\u03baB activity. Interestingly, we show an inverse correlation between DUSP1 expression and activation of both p65/NF-\u03baB and p38 MAPK in human prostate tissue specimens. Thus, most of apparently normal glands, benign prostatic hyperplasia and low-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia samples show high DUSP1 expression and low levels of both nuclear p65/NF-\u03baB and activated p38 MAPK. By contrast, DUSP1 expression levels are low or even absent in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostatic adenocarcinoma samples, whereas nuclear p65/NF-\u03baB and activated p38 MAPK are highly expressed in the same samples. Overall, our results provide evidence for a role of DUSP1 in the apoptosis of prostate cancer cells, through a mechanism involving the inhibition of p38 MAPK and NF-\u03baB. Furthermore, our findings suggest that the ratio between DUSP1 and p65/NF-\u03baB expression levels, rather than the individual expression of both molecules, is a better marker for diagnostic purposes in prostate cancer.",

First, we demonstrated pronounced migration of human MCs toward conditioned medium from cultures of glioma cell lines. Subsequent cytokine array analyses of media from cells, cultured in either serum-containing or -free conditions, revealed a number of candidates which were secreted in high amounts in both cell lines. Among these, we then focused on macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), which has been reported to be pro-inflammatory and -tumorigenic. Infiltration of MCs was attenuated by antibodies that neutralized MIF. Moreover, a positive correlation between the number of MCs and the level of MIF in a large cohort of human glioma tissue samples was observed.Further, both glioma-conditioned media and purified MIF promoted differential phosphorylation of a number of signaling molecules, including signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5), in MCs. Inhibition of pSTAT5 signaling significantly attenuated the migration of MCs toward glioma cell-conditioned medium shown to contain MIF. In addition, analysis of tissue microarrays (TMAs) of high-grade gliomas revealed a direct correlation between the level of pSTAT5 in MCs and the level of MIF in the medium.In conclusion, these findings indicate the important influence of signaling cascades involving MIF and STAT5 on the recruitment of MCs to gliomas.",

Augmented levels of TGF\u03b2-1 and L1CAM upon expression of KLK4\u20137 were corroborated in\u00a0vivo by an ovarian cancer xenograft model. The degradomic analysis showed that KLK4\u20137 expression mostly affected cleavage sites C-terminal to arginine, corresponding to the preference of kallikreins 4, 5 and 6. Putative kallikrein substrates include chemokines, such as growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF 15) and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF). Proteolytic maturation of TGF\u03b2-1 was also elevated. KLK4\u20137 have a pronounced, yet non-degrading impact on the secreted proteome, with a strong association between these proteases and TGF\u03b2-1 signaling in tumor biology.",

     "abstract": "Chemotherapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is the standard of care, but ultimately nearly all patients develop drug resistance. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to resistance to individual chemotherapeutic agents may help identify novel targets and drugs that will, in turn, improve therapy. Oxaliplatin is a common component combination therapeutic regimen for use in patients with metastatic CRC, but is also used as a component of adjuvant therapy for patients at risk for recurrent disease. In this study, unbiased microRNA array screening revealed that the miR-203 microRNA is up-regulated in three of three oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell lines, and therefore we investigated the role of miR-203 in chemoresistance. Exogenous expression of miR-203 in chemo-na\u00efve CRC cells induced oxaliplatin resistance. Knockdown of miR-203 sensitized chemoresistant CRC cells to oxaliplatin. In silico analysis identified ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a primary mediator of the DNA damage response, as a potential target of miR-203. ATM mRNA and protein levels were significantly down-regulated in CRC cells with acquired resistance to oxaliplatin. Using TCGA database, we identified a significant reverse correlation of miR-203 and ATM expression in CRC tissues. We validated ATM as a bona fide target of miR-203 in CRC cells. Mutation of the putative miR-203 binding site in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032UTR) of the ATM mRNA abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-203 on ATM. Furthermore, stable knockdown of ATM induced resistance to oxaliplatin in chemo-na\u00efve CRC cells. This is the first report of oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells induced by miR-203-mediated suppression of ATM.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. We have characterized the role of miRNAs in regulating the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-pathway in breast cancer. We performed miRNA gain-of-function assays by screening two HER2 amplified cell lines (KPL-4 and JIMT-1) with a miRNA mimic library consisting of 810 human miRNAs. The levels of HER2, phospho-AKT, phospho-ERK1/2, cell proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (cPARP) were analyzed with reverse-phase protein arrays. Rank product analyses identified 38 miRNAs (q\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as inhibitors of HER2 signaling and cell growth, the most effective being miR-491-5p, miR-634, miR-637 and miR-342-5p. We also characterized miRNAs directly targeting HER2 and identified seven novel miRNAs (miR-552, miR-541, miR-193a-5p, miR-453, miR-134, miR-498, and miR-331-3p) as direct regulators of the HER2 3\u2032UTR. We demonstrated the clinical relevance of the miRNAs and identified miR-342-5p and miR-744* as significantly down-regulated in HER2-positive breast tumors as compared to HER2-negative tumors from two cohorts of breast cancer patients (101 and 1302 cases). miR-342-5p specifically inhibited HER2-positive cell growth, as it had no effect on the growth of HER2-negative control cells in\u00a0vitro. Furthermore, higher expression of miR-342-5p was associated with better survival in both breast cancer patient cohorts. In conclusion, we have identified miRNAs which are efficient negative regulators of the HER2 pathway that may play a role in\u00a0vivo during breast cancer progression. These results give mechanistic insights in HER2 regulation which may open potential new strategies towards prevention and therapeutic inhibition of HER2-positive breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "We have recently gained a remarkable understanding of the mutational landscape of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the nature of the dysregulated signaling networks contributing to HNSCC progression is still poorly defined. Here, we have focused on the role of the family of mitogen activated kinases (MAPKs), extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 MAPK in HNSCC. Immunohistochemical analysis of a large collection of human HNSCC tissues revealed that the levels of the phosphorylated active form of ERK1/2 and JNK were elevated in less than 33% and 16% of the cases, respectively. Strikingly, however, high levels of active phospho-p38 were observed in most (79%) of hundreds of tissues analyzed. We explored the biological role of p38 in HNSCC cell lines using three independent approaches: treatment with a specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580; a retro-inhibition strategy consisting in the use of SB203580 combined with the expression of an inhibitor-insensitive mutant form of p38\u03b1; and short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting p38\u03b1. We found that specific blockade of p38 signaling significantly inhibited the proliferation of HNSCC cells both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Indeed, we observed that p38 inhibition in HNSCC cancer cells reduces cancer growth in tumor xenografts and a remarkable decrease in intratumoral blood and lymphatic vessels. We conclude that p38\u03b1 functions as a positive regulator of HNSCC in the context of the tumor microenvironment, controlling cancer cell growth as well as tumor-induced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis.",

This study aimed at investigating the potential of claudin-2, over-expressed in breast cancer liver metastases, as a biomarker for predicting liver metastatic propensity in primary breast cancer.Claudin-2 expression was analyzed in two independent cohorts. Cohort 1 included 304 women with metastatic breast cancer diagnosed between 2002 and 2007, while cohort 2 included 237 premenopausal women with early-stage node-negative breast cancer diagnosed between 1991 and 1994. Global transcriptional profiling of fine-needle aspirates from metastases was performed, followed by immunohistochemical analyses in archival primary tumor tissue. Associations between claudin-2 expression and relapse site were assessed by univariable and multivariable Cox regression models including conventional prognostic factors. Two-sided statistical tests were used.CLDN2 was significantly up-regulated (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in liver metastases compared to other metastatic sites. Claudin-2 protein was more frequently expressed in primary tumors from patients who subsequently developed liver metastases (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and high expression was associated with a shorter metastasis-free interval (cohort 1, HR\u00a0=\u00a01.4, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.0\u20131.9; cohort 2, HR\u00a0=\u00a02.2, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.3\u20133.5).

In this study, whole transcriptome analysis was performed with GeneChip Human exon 1.0 ST Array from 80 samples comprising 23 normal colon mucosa, 30 primary colorectal cancer and 27 liver metastatic specimens from 46 patients, to identify AS events in colorectal cancer progression. Differentially expressed genes and exons were estimated and AS events were reconstructed by combining exon-level analyses with AltAnalyze algorithms and transcript-level estimations (MMBGX probabilistic method). The number of AS genes in the transition from normal colon mucosa to primary tumor was the most abundant, but fell considerably in the next transition to liver metastasis. 206 genes with probable AS events in colon cancer development and progression were identified, that are involved in processes and pathways relevant to tumor biology, as cell\u2013cell and cell-matrix interactions. Several AS events in VCL, CALD1, B3GNT6 and CTHRC1 genes, differentially expressed during tumor development were validated, at RNA and at protein level.

Univariate logistic regression and 3-fold cross validation were carried out for the training (67% of patients) and validation (33%) sets. Non-clinical experiments in EC cells were performed to generate complimentary data.Of 167 EC patients analyzed, 40 (24%) had a pathologic complete response (pathCR) and 27 (16%) had an extremely resistant (exCRTR) cancer.

DNA samples extracted from synchronous tumor masses in the breast, adnexal, and pelvic-peritoneal regions from a 62-year-old BRCA1 germline mutation carrier were subjected to targeted massively parallel sequencing using a platform comprising 300 cancer genes known to harbor actionable mutations. In addition to BRCA1 germline mutations, all lesions harbored somatic loss of the BRCA1 wild-type allele and TP53 somatic mutations. The primary breast cancer displayed a TP53 frameshift (p.Q317fs) mutation, whereas and the adnexal lesion harbored a TP53 nonsense (p.R213*) mutation, consistent with a diagnosis of two independent primary tumors (i.e. breast and ovarian cancer). The adnexal tumor and all pelvic-peritoneal implants harbored identical TP53 (p.R213*) and NCOA2 (p.G952R) somatic mutations. Evidence of genetic heterogeneity within and between lesions was observed, both in terms of somatic mutations and copy number aberrations. The repertoires of somatic genetic aberrations found in the breast, ovarian, and pelvic-peritoneal lesions provided direct evidence in support of the distinct origin of the breast and ovarian cancers, and established that the pelvic-peritoneal implants were clonally related to the ovarian lesion. These observations were consistent with those obtained with immunohistochemical analyses employing markers to differentiate between carcinomas of the breast and ovary, including WT1 and PAX8. Our results on this case of a patient with BRCA1-mutant breast and ovarian cancer demonstrate that massively parallel sequencing may constitute a useful tool to define the relationship, clonality and intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity between primary tumor masses and their metastatic deposits in patients with multiple primary malignancies and synchronous metastases.",

In benign prostate glands, LPCAT1 immunostaining was absent or weak. In prostate cancer, LPCAT1 positivity was found in 73.8% of 8786 interpretable tumors including 29.2% with strong expression. Increased LPCAT1 expression was associated with advanced tumor stage (pT3b/T4) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), high Gleason score (\u22654\u00a0+\u00a04) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), positive nodal involvement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002), positive surgical margin (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005), and early PSA recurrence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

Strong LPCAT1 staining was detected in 45.3% of ERG positive but in only 16.7% of ERG negative tumors (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Within ERG negative cancers, LPCAT1 staining was strongly increased within the subgroup of PTEN deleted cancers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Further subgroup analyses revealed that associations of high LPCAT1 expression with PSA recurrence and unfavorable tumor phenotype were largely driven by ERG negative cancers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) while these effects were substantially mitigated in ERG positive cancers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0073). The prognostic impact of LPCAT1 expression was independent of histological and clinical parameters.

Extensive ER stress in cancer cells deliberately induced by chemotherapeutic drugs may lead to growth arrest and cell death. However, the link between ER stress and autophagy is not well understood. In this study, the treatment of cancer cells with ER stress-inducing drug nelfinavir resulted in the expression of endogenous mTOR inhibitor sestrin-2 (SESN2). Upregulation of SESN2 expression was associated with expression of ER stress markers ATF4, ATF3, and CHOP. SESN2 upregulation also occurred in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib. Ectopic expression of ATF4, but not of ATF3 or CHOP, caused transcriptional upregulation of SESN2 expression, indicating expressional regulation of SESN2 by ATF4. Transient overexpression of ectopic SESN2 resulted in mTOR inhibition and autophagy, confirming a link between ER stress, SESN2 upregulation, and mTOR inhibition. Accordingly, cancer cells treated with the ER stress-inducing agent nelfinavir showed reduced mTOR activity and associated increases in the expression levels of ATF4 and SESN2. These results show that ATF4-regulated SESN2 expression presents a new link between ER stress and mTOR inhibition and autophagy. mTOR inhibition by nelfinavir, which is currently in clinical trials for cancer patients, may also explain its observed ability to induce autophagy, growth arrest, and radiosensitization in cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal malignancies. It is typically detected at an advanced stage, at which the therapeutic options are very limited. One remarkable feature of PDAC that contributes to its resilience to treatment is the extreme stromal activation seen in these tumors. Often, the vast majority of tumor bulk consists of non-tumor cells that together provide a tumor-promoting environment. One of the signals that maintains and activates the stroma is the developmental protein Sonic Hedgehog (SHH). As the disease progresses, tumor cells produce increasing amounts of SHH, which activates the surrounding stroma to aid in tumor progression. To better understand this response and identify targets for inhibition, we aimed to elucidate the proteins that mediate the SHH-driven stromal response in PDAC. For this a novel mixed-species coculture model was set up in which the cancer cells are human, and the stroma is modeled by mouse fibroblasts. In conjunction with next-generation sequencing we were able to use the sequence difference between these species to genetically distinguish between the epithelial and stromal responses to SHH. The stromal SHH-dependent genes from this analysis were validated and their relevance for human disease was subsequently determined in two independent patient cohorts. In non-microdissected tissue from PDAC patients, in which a large amount of stroma is present, the targets were confirmed to associate with tumor stroma versus normal pancreatic tissue. Patient survival analysis and immunohistochemistry identified CDA, EDIL3, ITGB4, PLAUR and SPOCK1 as SHH-dependent stromal factors that are associated with poor prognosis in PDAC patients. Summarizing, the presented data provide insight into the role of the activated stroma in PDAC, and how SHH acts to mediate this response. In addition, the study has yielded several candidates that are interesting therapeutic targets for a disease for which treatment options are still inadequate.",

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising agent to treat uveal melanoma because of its induction of apoptosis in cancer cells both at primary and metastatic sites. However, TRAIL therapy lacks tumor specificity in the current delivery systems for uveal melanoma treatment, thereby causing cytotoxiciy to normal tissues. To improve uveal melanoma specificity of adenovirus-based TRAIL introduction, we used miRNA response elements (MREs) of miR-34a, miR-137 and miR-182, which have been shown to have reduced expression in uveal melanoma cells, to regulate its expression. miR-34a, miR-137 and miR-182 all had lower expression levels in uveal melanoma cell lines, compared with normal cells. MREs-regulated luciferase activity was reduced in normal cell lines, but not significantly attenuated in uveal melanoma cells. The infection of MRE-regulated TRAIL-expressing adenoviral vector (Ad-TRAIL-3MREs) led to high level of TRAIL expression in uveal melanoma cell lines, but not in normal cells. Strong expression of TRAIL had a high anti-tumor capacity by inducing apoptosis in uveal melanoma cells. In contrast, Ad-TRAIL-3MREs had no cytotoxicity to normal cell lines. Animal experiments further confirmed tumor-suppressing effect of Ad-TRAIL-3MREs on uveal melanoma xenografts and its biosafety to hepatic tissues. Collectively, we constructed an MRE-directed TRAIL-expressing adenoviral vector and provided evidence that this vector possessed high anti-tumor activity and uveal melanoma specificity.",

Both HOXA9 and MEIS1 are required for MLL-fusion gene-induced leukemogenesis. Co-expression of HOXA9 and MEIS1 induces acute myeloid leukemia (AML) similar to that seen in mice in which MLL-fusion genes are over-expressed. p27kip1 (p27 hereafter), a negative regulator of the cell cycle, has also been defined as an MLL target, the expression of which is up-regulated in MLL leukemic cells (LCs). To investigate whether p27 plays a role in the pathogenesis of MLL-leukemia, we examined the effects of p27 deletion (p27\u2212/\u2212) on MLL-AF9 (MA9)-induced murine AML development. HOXA9/MEIS1 (H/M)-induced, p27 wild-type (p27+/+) and p27\u2212/\u2212 AML were studied in parallel as controls. We found that LCs from both MA9-AML and H/M-AML can be separated into three fractions, a CD117-CD11bhi differentiated fraction as well as CD117+CD11bhi and CD117+CD11blo, two less differentiated fractions. The CD117+CD11blo fraction, comprising only 1\u20133% of total LCs, expresses higher levels of early hematopoietic progenitor markers but lower levels of mature myeloid cell markers compared to other populations of LCs. p27 is expressed and is required for maintaining the quiescent and drug-resistant states of the CD117+CD11blo fraction of MA9-LCs but not of H/M-LCs. p27 deletion significantly compromises the leukemogenic capacity of CD117+CD11blo MA9-LCs by reducing the frequency of leukemic stem cells (LSCs) but does not do so in H/M-LCs. In addition, we found that p27 is highly expressed and required for cell cycle arrest in the CD117-CD11bhi fraction in both types of LCs. Furthermore, we found that c-Myc expression is required for maintaining LCs in an undifferentiated state independently of proliferation. We concluded that p27 represses the proliferation of LCs, which is specifically required for maintaining the quiescent and drug-resistant states of a small subset of MA9-LSCs in collaboration with the differentiation blockage function of c-Myc.",

     "abstract": "Germ cell cancers (GCC) are the most frequent malignancy in young Caucasian males. GCC can consist of seminomas (SE) and non-seminomas (malignant NS: embryonal carcinoma (EC), yolk sac tumor (YS), choriocarcinoma (CH) and teratoma (TE)). Current serum-markers used for diagnosis and follow-up (AFP, hCG) are predominantly related to YS and CH and marker positivity can vary during disease. Therefore, stable markers consistently identifying more GCC components, specifically the stem cell components SE and EC, are of interest. Expression of the embryonic stem cell miR-371-3 and miR-302/367 clusters in SE/EC/YS suggest possible application of these micro-RNAs as GCC tumor-markers. The TSmiR protocol constitutes a complete, quality-controlled pipeline for the detection of miRs in serum, based on magnetic bead-based purification and qPCR quantification. As a proof of principle, TSmiR was applied to five independent serum sample series including 80\u00a0GCCs, 47 controls, 11 matched pre/post orchidectomy samples and 12 no-GCC testicular masses. GCC serum samples showed a consistent, significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0064) increase of miR-371/372/373/367 levels. Analogous, serum levels returned to baseline after orchidectomy (stage-I disease). Moreover, there was a trend toward higher miR levels in patients with metastasis. These results imply suitability for diagnosis and follow-up. TSmiR showed an overall sensitivity of 98%, clearly outperforming the traditional serum markers AFP/hCG (36%/57%, sensitivityAFP\u00a0=\u00a03%/45%; sensitivityhCG\u00a0=\u00a062%/66%, SE/NS). TSmiR misclassified one tumor as a control. Serum AFP/hCG and TSmiR combined identified all T samples correctly. In conclusion, TSmiR constitutes a highly sensitive and reproducible serum test for GCC patients, suitable to be prospectively tested for diagnostic and follow-up purposes.",

     "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with reduced sensitivity to many chemotherapeutic drugs, including EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here, we investigated if this reduced sensitivity also contributes to resistance to crizotinib, an ALK inhibitor of lung cancer that exhibits the EML4-ALK translocation. We established a crizotinib-resistant subline (H2228/CR), which was derived from the parental H2228 cell line by long-term exposure to increasing concentrations of crizotinib. Characteristics associated with EMT, including morphology, EMT marker proteins, and cellular mobility, were analyzed. Compared with H2228 cells, the growth of H2228/CR cells was independent of EML4-ALK, and H2228/CR cells showed cross-resistance to TAE-684 (a second-generation ALK inhibitor). Phenotypic changes to the spindle-cell shape were noted in H2228/CR cells, which were accompanied by a decrease in E-cadherin and increase in vimentin and AXL. In addition, H2228/CR cells showed increased secretion and expression of TGF-\u03b21. Invasion and migration capabilities were dramatically increased in H2228/CR cells. Applying TGF-\u03b21 treatment to parental H2228 cells for 72\u00a0h induced reversible EMT, leading to crizotinib resistance, but this was reversed by the removal of TGF-\u03b21. Suppression of vimentin in H2228/CR cells by siRNA treatment restored sensitivity to crizotinib. Furthermore, these resistant cells remained highly sensitive to the Hsp90 inhibitors, similar to the parental H2228 cells. In conclusion, we suggest EMT is possibly involved in acquired resistance to crizotinib, and that HSP90 inhibitors could be a promising option for the treatment of EMT.",

Despite the great efficacy of the Bcr-Abl-specific inhibitor imatinib, resistance to this drug is recognized as a major problem in CML treatment. We found that in LAMA84 cells, characterized by imatinib-resistance caused by BCR-ABL1 gene amplification, the pro-survival protein kinase CK2 is up-regulated as compared to the sensitive cells. CK2 exhibits a higher protein-level and a parallel enhancement of catalytic activity. Consistently, CK2-catalysed phosphorylation of Akt-Ser129 is increased. CK2 co-localizes with Bcr-Abl in the cytoplasmic fraction as judged by subcellular fractionation and fluorescence immunolocalization. CK2 and Bcr-Abl are members of the same multi-protein complex(es) in imatinib-resistant cells as demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation and co-sedimentation in glycerol gradients. Cell treatment with CX-4945, a CK2 inhibitor currently in clinical trials, counteracts CK2/Bcr-Abl interaction and causes cell death by apoptosis. Interestingly, combination of CX-4945 with imatinib displays a synergistic effect in reducing cell viability. Consistently, knockdown of CK2\u03b1 expression by siRNA restores the sensitivity of resistant LAMA84 cells to low imatinib concentrations. Remarkably, the CK2/Bcr-Abl interaction and the sensitization towards imatinib obtained by CK2-inhibition in LAMA84 is observable also in other imatinib-resistant CML cell lines.These results demonstrate that CK2 contributes to strengthen the imatinib-resistance phenotype of CML cells conferring survival advantage against imatinib. We suggest that CK2 inhibition might be a promising tool for combined strategies in CML therapy.",

We showed that c-Ski overexpression in immortalized breast normal fibroblasts (NFs) induces conversion to breast CAFs by repressing p53 and thereby upregulating SDF-1 in NFs. SDF-1 treatment or p53 knockdown in NFs had similar effects on the activation of NFs as c-Ski overexpression. The c-Ski-activated CAFs show increased proliferation, migration, invasion and contraction compared with NFs. Furthermore, c-Ski-activated CAFs facilitated the migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that c-Ski is an important regulator in the activation of CAFs and may serve as a potential therapeutic target to block breast cancer progression.",

     "abstract": "DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling are frequently implicated in the silencing of genes involved in carcinogenesis. Long Range Epigenetic Silencing (LRES) is a mechanism of gene inactivation that affects multiple contiguous CpG islands and has been described in different human cancer types. However, it is unknown whether there is a coordinated regulation of the genes embedded in these regions in normal cells and in early stages of tumor progression. To better characterize the molecular events associated with the regulation and remodeling of these regions we analyzed two regions undergoing LRES in human colon cancer in the mouse model. We demonstrate that LRES also occurs in murine cancer in\u00a0vivo and mimics the molecular features of the human phenomenon, namely, downregulation of gene expression, acquisition of inactive histone marks, and DNA hypermethylation of specific CpG islands. The genes embedded in these regions showed a dynamic and autonomous regulation during mouse intestinal cell differentiation, indicating that, in the framework considered here, the coordinated regulation in LRES is restricted to cancer. Unexpectedly, benign adenomas in ApcMin/+ mice showed overexpression of most of the genes affected by LRES in cancer, which suggests that the repressive remodeling of the region is a late event. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of the transcriptional insulator CTCF in mouse colon cancer cells revealed disrupted chromatin domain boundaries as compared with normal cells. Malignant regression of cancer cells by in\u00a0vitro differentiation resulted in partial reversion of LRES and gain of CTCF binding. We conclude that genes in LRES regions are plastically regulated in cell differentiation and hyperproliferation, but are constrained to a coordinated repression by abolishing boundaries and the autonomous regulation of chromatin domains in cancer cells.",

Although high CDCP1 expression has been correlated with poor prognosis in lung, breast, pancreas, and renal cancer, its functional role in tumor formation or progression is incompletely understood. So far it has remained unclear, whether CDCP1 is a useful target for antibody therapy of cancer and what could be a desired mode of action for a therapeutically useful antibody. To shed light on these questions, we have investigated the cellular effects of a therapeutic antibody candidate (RG7287). In focus formation assays, prolonged RG7287 treatment prevented the loss of contact inhibition caused by co-transformation of NIH3T3 cells with CDCP1 and Src. In a xenograft study, MCF7 cells stably overexpressing CDCP1 reached the predefined tumor volume faster than the parental MCF7 cells lacking endogenous CDCP1. This tumor growth advantage was abolished by RG7287 treatment. In\u00a0vitro, RG7287 induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of CDCP1 by Src, which was accompanied by translocation of CDCP1 to a Triton X-100 insoluble fraction of the plasma membrane. Triggering these effects required bivalency of the antibody suggesting that it involves CDCP1 dimerization or clustering. However, this initial activation of CDCP1 was only transient and prolonged RG7287 treatment induced internalization and down-regulation of CDCP1 in different cancer cell lines. Antibody stimulated CDCP1 degradation required Src activity and was proteasome dependent. Also in three different xenograft models with endogenous CDCP1 expression RG7287 treatment resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition concomitant with substantially reduced CDCP1 levels as judged by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Thus, despite transiently activating CDCP1 signaling, the RG7287 antibody has a therapeutically useful mode of action.",

DCIS is a non-obligate precursor of invasive breast cancer, and up to 40% of these lesions progress to invasive disease if untreated. Currently, it is not possible to predict accurately which DCIS would be more likely to progress to invasive breast cancer as neither the significant drivers of the invasive transition have been identified, nor has the clinical utility of tests predicting the likelihood of progression been demonstrated. Although molecular studies have shown that qualitatively, synchronous DCIS and invasive breast cancers are remarkably similar, there is burgeoning evidence to demonstrate that intra-tumor genetic heterogeneity is observed in a subset of DCIS, and that the process of progression to invasive disease may constitute an \u2018evolutionary bottleneck\u2019, resulting in the selection of subsets of tumor cells with specific genetic and/or epigenetic aberrations.

We previously showed that WNT-5A signaling inhibits migration and metastasis of breast cancer cells, and that patients with primary breast cancer in which WNT-5A was expressed have a better prognosis. Despite the fact that RhoGTPase Cdc42 is commonly associated with increased cell migration, we here show that recombinant WNT-5A activates the Cdc42 in breast cancer cells (lines MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB231) in a time-dependent manner. Activation of Cdc42 was also observed in MDA-MB468 cells that were stably transfected with a WNT-5A plasmid (MDA-MB468-5A). In all situations, increased Cdc42 activity was accompanied by decreased migration and invasion of the breast cancer cells. To explore these findings further we also investigated the effect of WNT-5A signaling on ERK1/2 activity. Apart from an initial Ca2+-dependent rWNT-5A-induced activation of ERK1/2, Cdc42 activity was inversely correlated with ERK1/2 activity in both rWNT-5A-stimulated parental MDA-MB468 and MDA-MB468-5A cells. We also demonstrated increased ERK1/2 activity in MDA-MB468-5A cells following siRNA knockdown of Cdc42. Consistent with these results, breast cancer cells transfected with constitutively active Cdc42 exhibited reduced ERK1/2 activity, migration and invasion, whereas cells transfected with dominant negative Cdc42 had increased ERK1/2 activity in response to rWNT-5A. To gain information on how ERK1/2 can mediate its effect on breast cancer cell migration and invasion, we next investigated and demonstrated that WNT-5A signaling and constitutively active Cdc42 both decreased matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) activity. These data indicate an essential role of Cdc42 and ERK1/2 signaling and MMP9 activity in WNT-5A-impaired breast cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "TRAP1 is a mitochondrial antiapoptotic protein up-regulated in several human malignancies. However, recent evidences suggest that TRAP1 is also localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is involved in ER stress protection and protein quality control of tumor cells. Based on the mechanistic link between ER stress, protection from apoptosis and drug resistance, we questioned whether these novel roles of TRAP1 are relevant for its antiapoptotic function. Here, we show for the first time that: i) TRAP1 expression is increased in about 50% of human breast carcinomas (BC), and ii) the ER stress protecting activity of TRAP1 is conserved in human tumors since TRAP1 is co-upregulated with the ER stress marker, BiP/Grp78. Notably, ER-associated TRAP1 modulates mitochondrial apoptosis by exerting a quality control on 18\u00a0kDa Sorcin, a TRAP1 mitochondrial client protein involved in TRAP1 cytoprotective pathway. Furthermore, this TRAP1 function is relevant in favoring resistance to paclitaxel, a microtubule stabilizing/ER stress inducer agent widely used in BC therapy. Indeed, the transfection of a TRAP1 deletion mutant, whose localization is restricted to the ER, in shTRAP1 cells enhances the expression of mitochondrial Sorcin and protects from apoptosis induced by ER stress agents and paclitaxel. Furthermore, BC cells adapted to paclitaxel or ER stress inducers share common resistance mechanisms: both cell models exhibit cross-resistance to single agents and the inhibition of TRAP1 by siRNAs or gamitrinib, a mitochondria-directed HSP90 family inhibitor, in paclitaxel-resistant cells rescues the sensitivity to paclitaxel. These results support the hypothesis that ER-associated TRAP1 is responsible for an extramitochondrial control of apoptosis and, therefore, an interference of ER stress adaptation through TRAP1 inhibition outside of mitochondria may be considered a further compartment-specific molecular approach to rescue drug-resistance.",

Rac1 belongs to the small GTP-binding protein superfamily and is implicated in the interactions of hematopoietic progenitors and bone marrow niche. Our previous studies have shown that Rac1 is over-expressed in leukemia patients and activation of Rac1 GTPase is closely associated with the efficient migration of leukemia cells. However, the potential functions for Rac1 GTPase in LSCs behaviors and in the residence of leukemia cells in niche remain unknown. In this study, by forced expression of a dominant-negative form of Rac1 GTPase in a CD34+ myeloid leukemia cell line, as well as bone marrow cells from leukemia patients, we show that inactivation of Rac1 GTPase causes impaired migration and enhances chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Inactivation of Rac1 in leukemia cells also lead to a reduction in the frequency of cells in quiescent state and inhibition of homing to bone marrow niche. Gene expression analysis shows that inactivation of Rac1 down-regulates the expression of several cell intrinsic cell cycle inhibitors such as p21, p27, and p57, as well as the extrinsic molecules that mediated the interaction of LSC with osteoblastic niche. Furthermore, we show that Rac1 mediated the localization in niche is further attributed to the maintenance of quiescence.

Furthermore, cisplatin treatment significantly prolonged the survival time only of ASML-C4.4Akd-bearing rats. ASML-C4.4Akd cells display reduced migratory activity and impaired matrix protein degradation due to inefficient MMP14 activation; loss of drug-resistance is due to mitigated PI3K/Akt pathway activation. These losses of function rely on the laminin receptor C4.4A recruiting activated alpha6beta4 integrin into rafts, where C4.4A cooperates with alpha6beta4 and via alpha6beta4 with MMP14. Within this raft-located complex, MMP14 provokes focalized matrix degradation and mostly alpha6beta4 integrin promotes BAD phosphorylation and upregulated Bcl2 and BclXl expression.Thus, metastasis-promoting activities of C4.4A are not genuine characteristics of C4.4A. Instead, the raft-located laminin receptor C4.4A recruits alpha6beta4 integrin and supports via the alpha6beta4 integrin MMP14 activation.

     "abstract": "MACC1, Metastasis associated in colon cancer 1, is a newly identified prognostic biomarker for colorectal cancer metastasis and patient survival, when determined in the primary tumor or patient blood. MACC1 induces cell motility and proliferation in cell culture and metastasis in mouse models. MACC1 acts as a transcriptional regulator of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Met via binding to its promoter. However, no information about the promoter of the MACC1 gene and its transcriptional regulation has been reported so far. Here we report the identification of the MACC1 promoter using a promoter luciferase construct that directs transcription of MACC1. To gain insights into the essential domains within this promoter region, we constructed 5\u2032 truncated deletion constructs. Our results show that the region from \u2212426 to \u221218 constitutes the core promoter and harbors functional motifs for the binding of AP-1, Sp1, and C/EBP transcription factors as validated by site directed mutagenesis study. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated the physical interaction of these transcription factors to a minimal essential MACC1 core promoter sequence. Knock down of these transcription factors using RNAi strategy reduced MACC1 expression (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and resulted in decrease of cell migration (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) which could be specifically rescued by ectopic overexpression of MACC1. In human colorectal tumors, expression levels of c-Jun and Sp1 correlated significantly to MACC1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0007 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.02, respectively). Importantly, levels of c-Jun and Sp1 also showed significant correlation to development of metachronous metastases (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.001, respectively). This is the first study identifying the MACC1 promoter and its transcriptional regulation by AP-1 and Sp1. Knowledge of the transcriptional regulation of the MACC1 gene will implicate in enhanced understanding of its role in cancer progression and metastasis.",

We found that SPRR3 was localized in mitochondria and interacted with Bcl-2 in\u00a0vivo, thus facilitating Bax mitochondrial translocation and the subsequent release of cytochrome c, and thereby enhancing cell sensitivity to DNA damage stimuli. In clinical samples, expression of SPRR3 was associated with the pathologic response (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007 in radiotherapy group, P\u00a0=\u00a00.035 in preoperative radiotherapy group) and good survival of patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008).

     "abstract": "Dasatinib is a second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor approved for the treatment of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, both in the frontline and in the imatinib-resistant/intolerant settings. The high affinity of dasatinib for the protein is currently assumed to result from its ability to bind both the active and inactive conformations of the BCR-ABL kinase. In the present work, using state of the art molecular simulation techniques we prove that dasatinib exhibits a highly selective preference for the active (open) BCR-ABL conformation. By using three different BCR-ABL conformations (active, inactive, and\u00a0intermediate inactive) we show that, from a thermodynamic standpoint, the affinity of dasatinib for BCR-ABL drastically decreases in the order: active\u00a0>\u00a0alternative inactive\u00a0>\u00a0inactive, as a result of differential contributions from the single residues lining the kinase binding pocket and the concomitant stabilization/destabilization of the kinase hydrophobic spine. Molecule-pulling experiments also corroborate this trend as significantly lower forces and smaller times are required to extract dasatinib from its inactive BCR-ABL complexes with respect to the active complex counterparts. Importantly, our results support recent NMR solution results demonstrating no evidence of dasatinib bound to the inactive form of BCR-ABL.",

The aim of the project was to develop a method to identify hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of metastatic breast cancer (metBC) patients.From 44 enrolled CTC-positive metBC patients a total number of 57 peripheral blood samples were analysed by CellSearch\u00ae. Genomic DNA of enriched CTCs was isolated, amplified and analyzed for PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20 which lead to E542K, E545K or H1047R amino acid changes and result in increased PI3K activity. The mutations were detected by using SNaPshot-methodology comprising PCR amplification and single nucleotide primer extension.SNaPshot analysis was established using genomic DNA from different breast cancer cell lines and then successfully transferred to investigate blood samples and single cells. Overall, twelve hotspot mutations in either exon 9/E545K (6/12, 50%) or exon 20/H1047R (6/12, 50%) could be determined within 9 out of 57 (15.8%) blood samples from 7 out of 44 (15.9%) patients; CTC counts ranged from 1 to 9748. PIK3CA variants E542K, E545G and E545A were not detected.Analysing the PIK3CA genotype of CTCs has clinical relevance with respect to drug resistance, e.g. against HER2-targeted therapy.

There is a critical need to identify those patients at risk of late-relapse (>5 years), in order to select potential candidates for further treatment and to identify molecular targets for such treatment.A total of 252 breast primary tumors were selected at the Netherlands Cancer Institute from a retrospective series of ER+, HER2\u2212 breast cancer patients with a follow-up of at least 10 years. Gene expression analysis was performed using Agilent\u00a04x44K microarrays. Patients were classified in 3 groups: no relapse (M0); relapse before 5 years (M0-5) or after 5 years (M5-15). We assessed the correlation of clinico-pathological variables with late Distant Metastases (DM). We divided the patient series into a training set of untreated patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0140) and a test set of treated patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0112), to investigate whether a gene-signature or single genes could be identified for predicting late DM. Pathway level late DM correlates were identified using PARADIGM and DAVID.Of the clinico-pathologic variables tested, only lymph node status associated with late DM. A 241-gene signature developed on the NKI training set was able to classify M5-15 patients in the test set with a sensitivity of 77% and a specificity of 33% (AUC 0.654). This signature showed enrichment in genes involved in immune response and extracellular matrix. An alternative analysis of individual genes identified CH25H as an independent predictor of distant metastasis in our patient series.We identified a gene signature for late metastasis in breast cancer. Our data are consistent with a model in which suppressed anti-tumoral immunity enables dormant tumor cells to re-enter the cell cycle to form metastases in response to extrinsic events in the microenvironment.",

Vorinostat-induced the activation of caspase-8 and -9, the initiators caspases of the extrinsic and the intrinsic apoptotic pathways, respectively. Next, we investigated the role of the extrinsic pathway in apoptosis triggered by Vorinostat. We found that Vorinostat caused a dramatic decrease of FLIP mRNA and protein levels. However, overexpression of the long from of FLIP did not block Vorinostat-induced apoptosis. To further investigate the role of extrinsic apoptotic pathway in Vorinostat-induced apoptosis, we performed an shRNA-mediated knock-down of caspase-8. Surprisingly, downregulation of caspase-8 alone caused a marked decrease in clonogenic ability and reduced the growth of endometrial cancer xenografts in\u00a0vivo, revealing that targeting caspase-8 may be an attractive target for anticancer therapy on endometrial tumors. Furthermore, combination of caspase-8 inhibition and Vorinostat treatment caused an enhancement of apoptotic cell death and a further decrease of clonogenic growth of endometrial cancer cells. More importantly, combination of Vorinostat and caspase-8 inhibition caused a nearly complete inhibition of tumor xenograft growth. Finally, we demonstrate that cell death triggered by Vorinostat alone or in combination with caspase-8 shRNAs was inhibited by the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-XL.

We sought to develop an in\u00a0vivo model derived from patients reflecting the evolving HNSCC epidemiologic landscape, and use it to identify new therapies. Primary and relapsed tumors from HNSCC patients, both HPV+ and HPV\u2212, were implanted on mice, giving rise to 25 strains. Resulting xenografts were characterized by detecting key mutations, measuring protein expression by IHC and gene expression/pathway analysis by mRNA-sequencing. Drug efficacy studies were run with representative xenografts using the approved drug cetuximab as well as the new PI3K inhibitor PX-866. Tumors maintained their original morphology, genetic profiles and drug susceptibilities through serial passaging. The genetic makeup of these tumors was consistent with known frequencies of TP53, PI3KCA, NOTCH1 and NOTCH2 mutations. Because the EGFR inhibitor cetuximab is a standard HNSCC therapy, we tested its efficacy and observed a wide spectrum of efficacy. Cetuximab-resistant strains had higher PI3K/Akt pathway gene expression and protein activation than cetuximab-sensitive strains. The PI3K inhibitor PX-866 had anti-tumor efficacy in HNSCC models with PIK3CA alterations. Finally, PI3K inhibition was effective in two cases with NOTCH1 inactivating mutations. In summary, we have developed an HNSCC model covering its clinical spectrum whose major genetic alterations and susceptibility to anticancer agents represent contemporary HNSCC. This model enables to prospectively test therapeutic-oriented hypotheses leading to personalized medicine.",

L1 has been implicated in various forms of cancer, but its role in the regulation of the oncogenic phenotype is not understood. The present studies were conducted to evaluate mechanisms of genetic regulatory control in HepG2 cells by human L1, or a D702Y mutant deficient in RT activity, and their influence on cellular phenotype. Forced expression of synthetic L1 ORF1p and ORF2p was associated with formation of cytoplasmic foci and minor association with the nuclear compartment. While de novo L1 mobilizations were only identified in cells expressing wild type L1, and were absent in the D702Y mutant, changes in gene expression profiles involved RT dependent as well as RT independent mechanisms. Synthetic L1 altered the expression of 24 in silico predicted genetic targets; ten of which showed RT-dependence, ten RT-independence, and four reciprocal regulatory control by both wild type and RT mutant. Of five targets examined, only VCAM1 and PTPRB colocalized with newly retrotransposed wild type L1. Biological discretization to partition patterns of gene expression into unique frequencies identified adhesion, inflammation, and cellular metabolism as key processes targeted for molecular interference with disruption of epithelial-to-mesenchymal programming seen irrespective of the RT phenotype.

Around 3% of adult B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients show this aberration. Flow cytometry mostly reveals a \u201cmature B-ALL\u201d or \u201cBurkitt-type\u201d ALL immunophenotype. Using long-distance PCR for t(8;14)/MYC-IGH fusion, we investigated bone marrow, peripheral blood and a few other samples with suspected Burkitt-ALL or mature B-ALL and identified 133 MYC-IGH-positive cases. The location of the chromosomal breaks in the IGH joining and the 8 different switch regions was determined using a set of long-distance PCRs. The chromosomal breakpoints with the adjacent MYC regions on 8q24 were characterized by direct sequencing in 49 cases. The distribution of chromosomal breaks among the IGH joining and switch regions was the following: JH 23.3%, M 21.8%, G1 15.0%, G2 7.5%, G3 3.8%, G4 4.5%, A1 12.8%, A2 3.8%, E 7.5%. Two breakpoint clusters near MYC were delineated. There was no clear correlation between the degree of somatic hypermutation and the chromosomal break locations. Epstein Barr virus was detected in 5 cases (4%). This detailed and extensive molecular analysis illustrates the molecular complexity of the MYC-IGH translocations and the detected distribution of breakpoints provides additional evidence that this translocation results from failed switch and VDJ recombinations. This study may serve as a model for the analysis of other IGH translocations in B-cell lymphoma.",

As an example, only some women will benefit from chemotherapy. Identifying patients who will respond to chemotherapy and thereby improve their long-term survival has important implications to treatment protocols and outcomes, while identifying non responders may enable these patients to avail themselves of other investigational approaches or other potentially effective treatments. In this study, serum metabolite profiling was performed to identify potential biomarker candidates that can predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer. Metabolic profiles of serum from patients with complete (n\u00a0=\u00a08), partial (n\u00a0=\u00a014) and no response (n\u00a0=\u00a06) to chemotherapy were studied using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) and statistical analysis methods. The concentrations of four metabolites, three (threonine, isoleucine, glutamine) from NMR and one (linolenic acid) from LC\u2013MS were significantly different when comparing response to chemotherapy. A prediction model developed by combining NMR and MS derived metabolites correctly identified 80% of the patients whose tumors did not show complete response to chemotherapy.

This study aimed to investigate the maturation and activation of wild-type (WT) and mutant (M) forms of KIT in hemizygous and heterozygous conditions. WT and two types of exon 11 deletions M forms of human KIT were expressed in NIH3T3 cell lines. Membrane expression of KIT was quantified by flow cytometry. Quantification of glycosylated forms of KIT and phosphorylated forms of AKT and ERK were performed by western blot. Simultaneous activation of WT KIT and treatment with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) inhibitors, tunicamycin or brefeldin A induced a complete inhibition of membrane expression of the 145\u00a0kDa form of KIT. By contrast activation or ER inhibitors alone, only partly inhibited this form. ER inhibitors also inhibited KIT activation-dependent phosphorylation of AKT and ERK1/2. Brefeldin A induced a complete down regulation of the 145\u00a0kDa form in hemizygous M, and induced an intra-cellular accumulation of the 125\u00a0kDa form in WT but not in hemizygous M. Heterozygous cells had glycosylation and response to ER inhibitors patterns more similar to WT than to hemizygous M. Phosphorylated AKT was reduced in hemizygous cells in comparison to WT KIT cells and heterozygous cells, and in the presence of brefeldin A in all cell lines. Effects of ER inhibitors are significantly different in hemizygous and heterozygous mutants. Differences in intra-cellular trafficking of KIT forms result in differences in downstream signaling pathways, and activation of PI3K/AKT pathway appears to be tied to the presence of the mature 145\u00a0kDa form of KIT at the membrane surface.",

However, resection is possible in only a minority of patients due to the advanced stages often present at the time of diagnosis, and safely obtaining sufficient quantities of pancreatic tumor tissue for molecular analysis is difficult at the unresectable stages. In this study, we investigated whether the serum level of miR-21 could be used as a predictor of chemosensitivity. We tested the levels of serum miR-21 in a cohort of 177 cases of advanced pancreatic cancer who received gemcitabine-based palliative chemotherapy. We found that a high level of miR-21 in the serum was significantly correlated with a shortened time-to-progression (TTP) and a lower overall survival (OS). The serum miR-21 level was an independent prognostic factor for both the TTP and the OS (HR 1.920; 95% CI, 1.274\u20132.903, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 for TTP and HR 1.705; 95% CI, 1.147\u20132.535, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008 for OS). The results from a functional study showed that gemcitabine exposure down-regulated miR-21 expression and up-regulated FasL expression. The increased FasL expression following gemcitabine treatment induced cancer cell apoptosis, whereas the ectopic expression of miR-21 partially protected the cancer cells from gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. Additionally, we confirmed that FasL was a direct target of miR-21. Therefore, the serum level of miR-21 may serve as a predictor of chemosensitivity in advanced pancreatic cancer. Additionally, we identified a new mechanism of chemoresistance mediated by the effects of miR-21 on the FasL/Fas pathway.",

     "abstract": "Gene therapy and antibody approaches are crucial auxiliary strategies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. Previously, we established a survivin promoter-regulated oncolytic adenovirus that has inhibitory effect on HCC growth. The human sulfatase-1 (hSulf-1) gene can suppress the growth factor signaling pathways, then inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and enhance cellular sensitivity to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. I131-metuximab (I131-mab) is a monoclonal anti-HCC antibody that conjugated to I131 and specifically recognizes the HAb18G/CD147 antigen on HCC cells. To integrate the oncolytic adenovirus-based gene therapy and the I131-mab-based radioimmunotherapy, this study combined the CArG element of early growth response-l (Egr-l) gene with the survivin promoter to construct a radiation-inducible enhanced promoter, which was used to recombine a radiation-inducible oncolytic adenovirus as hSulf-1 gene vector. When I131-mab was incorporated into the treatment regimen, not only could the antibody produce radioimmunotherapeutic effect, but the I131 radiation was able to further boost adenoviral proliferation. We demonstrated that the CArG-enhanced survivin promoter markedly improved the proliferative activity of the oncolytic adenovirus in HCC cells, thereby augmenting hSulf-1 expression and inducing cancer cell apoptosis. This novel strategy that involved multiple, synergistic mechanisms, including oncolytic therapy, gene therapy and radioimmunotherapy, was demonstrated to exert an excellent anti-cancer outcome, which will be a promising approach in HCC treatment.",

     "abstract": "Despite nearly universal expression of the wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and reproducible activity of EGFR inhibitors in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), the majority of patients will not have objective responses. The mechanisms of this intrinsic resistance are not well established. We hypothesized that sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors can be predicted based on the inhibitors' effects on downstream signaling. Cell viability assays were used to assess sensitivity to the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib (ZD1839) in 8 SCCHN cell lines. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization showed the two most sensitive lines to be highly gene-amplified for EGFR. Western blotting confirmed that phosphoEGFR was inhibited at low concentrations of gefitinib in all lines tested. Phosphorylation of downstream signaling protein AKT was inhibited in sensitive lines while inhibition of phosphoERK displayed no relationship to gefitinib efficacy. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) expression was evident in all cell lines. Activating PIK3CA mutations were found in two resistant cell lines where pAKT was not inhibited by gefitinib. In resistant cell lines harboring PIK3CA mutations, a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, or AKT siRNA reduced cell viability with an additive effect demonstrated in combination with gefitinib. Additionally, LY294002 alone and in combination with gefitinib, was effective at treating PIK3CA mutated tumors xenografted into nude mice. Taken together this suggests that constitutively active AKT is a mechanism of intrinsic gefitinib resistance in SCCHN. This resistance can be overcome through targeting of the PI3K/AKT pathway in combination with EGFR inhibition.",

     "abstract": "Constitutively-activated JAK/Stat3 or Src/Stat3 signaling plays a crucial role in tumor cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis and immune suppression. Activated JAK/Stat3 or Src/Stat3 has been validated as a promising molecular target for cancer therapy. However, prolonged inhibition of Src family kinases (SFKs) leads to reactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcript 3 (Stat3) and tumor cell survival through altered JAK/Stat3 interaction. This compensatory feedback suggests that dual inhibition of Janus kinases (JAKs) and SFKs might be a promising strategy for targeting downstream Stat3 signaling in the clinic. In this study, we identify that the natural product derivative E738 is a novel dual inhibitor of JAKs and SFKs. The IC50 values of E738 against recombinant JAKs and SFKs in\u00a0vitro are in the ranges of 0.7\u201374.1\u00a0nM and 10.7\u2013263.9\u00a0nM, respectively. We observed that phosphorylation of both Jak2 and Src was substantially inhibited in the submicromolar range by E738 in cultured human pancreatic tumor cells, followed by blockade of downstream Stat3 activation. E738 down-regulated expression of the Stat3 target proteins Mcl-1 and survivin, associated with induction of apoptosis. Computational models and molecular dynamics simulations of E738/Tyk2 or E738/Src in silico suggest that E738 inhibits both tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) and Src as an ATP-competitive ligand. Moreover, the planar E738 molecule demonstrates a strong binding affinity in the compact ATP-binding site of Tyk2. In sum, E738 is the first dual inhibitor of JAKs and SFKs, followed by inhibition of Stat3 signaling. Thus, according to in\u00a0vitro experiments, E738 is a promising new therapeutic agent for human pancreatic cancer treatment by blocking both oncogenic pathways simultaneously.",

Functional crosstalk occurring between leptin and different signaling molecules contribute to breast carcinogenesis.In this study, we show, in different human breast cancer cell lines, that leptin enhanced the expression of a chaperone protein Hsp90 resulting in increased HER2 protein levels. Silencing of Hsp90 gene expression by RNA interference abrogated leptin-mediated HER2 up-regulation. Leptin effects were dependent on JAK2/STAT3 activation, since inhibition of this signaling cascade by AG490 or ectopic expression of a STAT3 dominant negative abrogated leptin-induced HER2 and Hsp90 expressions. Functional experiments showed that leptin treatment significantly up-regulated human Hsp90 promoter activity. This occurred through an enhanced STAT3 transcription factor binding to its specific responsive element located in the Hsp90 promoter region as revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Analysis of HER2, Akt and MAPK phosphorylation levels revealed that leptin treatment amplified the responsiveness of breast cancer cells to growth factor stimulation. Furthermore, we found that long-term leptin exposure reduced sensitivity of breast cancer cells to the antiestrogen tamoxifen. In the same experimental conditions, the combined treatment of tamoxifen with the Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG completely abrogated leptin-induced anchorage-independent breast cancer cell growth.In conclusion, our results highlight, for the first time, the ability of the adipocyte-secreted factor leptin to modulate Hsp90/HER2 expressions in breast cancer cells providing novel insights into the molecular mechanism linking obesity to breast cancer growth and progression.",

Although significant progress has been achieved for treating such patients with HER2 inhibitor trastuzumab, more than half of the patients respond poorly or become resistant to the treatment. Since the HER2 amplicon at 17q12 contains multiple genes, we have systematically explored the role of the HER2 co-amplified genes in breast cancer cell growth and their relation to trastuzumab resistance. We integrated aCGH data of the HER2 amplicon from 71 HER2 positive breast tumors and 10 cell lines with systematic functional RNA interference analysis of 23 core amplicon genes with several phenotypic endpoints in a panel of trastuzumab responding and non-responding HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Silencing of HER2 caused a greater growth arrest and apoptosis in the responding compared to the non-responding cell lines, indicating that the resistant cells are inherently less dependent on the HER2 pathway. Several other genes in the amplicon also showed a more pronounced effect when silenced; indicating that expression of HER2 co-amplified genes may be needed to sustain the growth of breast cancer cells. Importantly, co-silencing of STARD3, GRB7, PSMD3 and PERLD1 together with HER2 led to an additive inhibition of cell viability as well as induced apoptosis. These studies indicate that breast cancer cells may become addicted to the amplification of several genes that reside in the HER2 amplicon. The simultaneous targeting of these genes may increase the efficacy of the anti-HER2 therapies and possibly also counteract trastuzumab resistance. The observed additive effects seem to culminate to both apoptosis and cell proliferation pathways indicating that these pathways may be interesting targets for combinatorial treatment of HER2+ breast cancers.",

Here we describe the role of Grb10 in FLT3-ITD-mediated AML. We observed that Grb10 physically associates with FLT3 in response to FLT3-ligand (FL) stimulation through FLT3 phospho-tyrosine 572 and 793 residues and constitutively associates with oncogenic FLT3-ITD. Furthermore endogenous Grb10\u2013FLT3 association was observed in OCI-AML-5 cells. Grb10 expression did not alter FLT3 receptor activation or stability in Ba/F3-FLT3 cells. However, expression of Grb10 enhanced FL-induced Akt phosphorylation without affecting Erk or p38 phosphorylation in Ba/F3-FLT3-WT and Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD. Selective Grb10 depletion reduced Akt phosphorylation in Ba/F3-FLT3-WT and OCI-AML-5 cells. Grb10 transduces signal from FLT3 by direct interaction with p85 and Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells expressing Grb10 exhibits higher STAT5 activation. Grb10 regulates the cell cycle by increasing cell population in S-phase. Expression of Grb10 furthermore resulted in an increased proliferation and survival of Ba/F3-FLT3-ITD cells as well as increased colony formation in semisolid culture. Grb10 expression was significantly increased in AML patients compared to healthy controls and was also elevated in patients carrying FLT3-ITD mutants. The elevated Grb10 expression partially correlated to relapse as well as to poor prognosis. These results suggest that Grb10 binds to both normal and oncogenic FLT3 and induces PI3K\u2013Akt and STAT5 signaling pathways resulting in an enhanced proliferation, survival and colony formation of hematopoietic cells.",

SALL2 has also been identified as a cellular quiescence factor, essential for cells to enter and remain in a state of growth arrest under conditions of serum deprivation. p150 is a transcriptional activator of p21Cip1/Waf1 and BAX, sharing important growth arrest and proapoptotic properties with p53. It also acts as a repressor of c-myc. Restoration of SALL2 expression in cells derived from a human ovarian carcinoma (OVCA) suppresses growth of the cells in immunodeficient mice. Here we examine the pattern of p150 expression in the normal human ovary, in OVCA-derived cell lines and in primary ovarian carcinomas. Immunohistochemical staining showed that p150 is highly expressed in surface epithelial cells of the normal human ovary. Expression is exclusively from the P2 promoter governing the E1A splice variant of p150. The P2 promoter is CpG-rich and susceptible to methylation silencing. p150 expression was restored in OVCA cell lines following growth in the presence of 5-azacytidine. In a survey of 210 cases of OVCA, roughly 90% across major and minor histological types failed to show expression of the protein. Immunological and biochemical approaches were used to show hypermethylation of the SALL2 P2 promoter in OVCA-derived cell lines and in a majority of primary tumors. These results bring together molecular biological and clinical evidence in support of a role of SALL2 as a suppressor of ovarian cancers.",

PL-caused inhibition of the growth and metastasis of PC-3M cells accompanies inhibition of the expression of: 1) PKC\u03b5, pStat3Tyr705, and pStat3Ser727, 2) Stat3 downstream target genes (survivin and BclxL), 3) proliferative markers Ki-67 and PCNA, 4) metastatic marker MMP9, MMP2, and uPA, and 5) angiogenesis markers CD31 and VEGF. Taken together, these results suggest that PL inhibits tumor growth and metastasis of human PCa PC3-M-luciferase cells, which could be used as a therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of human PCa.",

     "abstract": "Targeted therapeutics have emerged in recent years as an attractive approach to treating various types of cancer. One approach is to modify a cytocidal protein toxin to direct its action to a specific population of cancer cells. We created a targeted toxin in which the receptor-binding and pore-forming moiety of anthrax toxin, termed Protective Antigen (PA), was modified to redirect its receptor specificity to HER2, a marker expressed at the surface of a significant fraction of breast and ovarian tumors. The resulting fusion protein (mPA-ZHER2) delivered cytocidal effectors specifically into HER2-positive tumor cells, including a trastuzumab-resistant line, causing death of the cells. No off-target killing of HER2-negative cells was observed, either with homogeneous populations or with mixtures of HER2-positive and HER2-negative cells. A mixture of mPA variants targeting different receptors mediated killing of cells bearing either receptor, without affecting cells devoid of these receptors. Anthrax toxin may serve as an effective platform for developing therapeutics to ablate cells bearing HER2 or other tumor-specific cell-surface markers.",

Kr\u00fcpple-like factor 4 (KLF4) is a transcription factor, the precise function of which in neuroblastoma is unclear. We examined the effects of KLF4 overexpression and apigenin (APG) treatment in human malignant neuroblastoma SK-N-DZ and IMR-32 cell lines. KLF4 overexpression in both SK-N-DZ and IMR-32 cell lines was confirmed by laser scanning immunofluorescent confocal microscopy and Western blotting. We found that 100\u00a0nM KLF4 plasmid and 25\u00a0\u03bcM APG synergistically inhibited the growth of SK-N-DZ and IMR-32 cells. We also found increase in KLF4 expression in response to treatment with various concentrations of APG. Combination of KLF4 plasmid and APG treatment significantly increased the amounts of apoptosis in both cell lines when compared with control vector or single treatment. We also noticed that the combination therapy decreased expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, increased expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax, Noxa, and Puma, upregulated p53, and caused activation of caspase-3 for cleavage of the inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase (ICAD) leading to completion of apoptosis machinery. Further, combination of KLF4 overexpression and APG treatment was highly effective in inhibiting migration of both neuroblastoma cell lines and was associated with down regulation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-2 and MMP-9. Collectively, our results from this investigation strongly suggest that KLF4 functions as a tumor suppressor and potentiates the anti-cancer activities of APG in two different human malignant neuroblastoma cell lines.",

To address these problems, ligand-targeted toxins in combination with low dose saponin mixtures have been adapted and tested in\u00a0vivo in the past, however, undefined saponin raw mixtures are not suitable for use in clinical development. In the present work we therefore used a targeted toxin (Sap3-EGF, i.e. saporin fused to epidermal growth factor) in combination with a structurally defined isolated saponin m/z 1861 (SO-1861). In\u00a0vitro evaluation confirmed a 6900-fold enhancement in the cytotoxic efficacy of Sap3-EGF against TSA-EGFR target cells.

At present, concerted efforts are focusing on understanding the characteristic INI1 mutation and its implications for the growth and survival of these tumors. Additionally, pharmaceutical pipeline libraries constitute a significant source of potential agents that can be taken to clinical trials in a timely manner. However, this process requires efficient target validation and relevant preclinical studies. As an initial screening approach, a panel of 129 small molecule inhibitors from multiple pharmaceutical pipeline libraries was tested against three ATRT cell lines by in\u00a0vitro cytotoxicity assays. Based on these data, agents that have strong activity and corresponding susceptible cellular pathways were identified. Target modulation, antibody array analysis, drug combination and in\u00a0vivo xenograft studies were performed on one of the pathway inhibitors found in this screening. Approximately 20% of agents in the library showed activity with IC50 values of 1\u00a0\u03bcM or less and many showed IC50 values less than 0.05\u00a0\u03bcM. Intra cell line variability was also noted among some of the drugs. However, it was determined that agents capable of affecting pathways constituting ErbB2, mTOR, proteasomes, Hsp90, Polo like kinases and Aurora kinases were universally effective against the three ATRT cell lines. The first target selected for further analysis, the inhibition of ErbB2-EGFR pathway by the small molecule inhibitor lapatinib, indicated inhibition of cell migration properties and the initiation of apoptosis. Synergy between lapatinib and IGF-IR inhibition was also demonstrated by combination index (CI) values. Xenograft studies showed effective antitumor activity of lapatinib in\u00a0vivo. We present an experimental approach to identifying agents and drug combinations for future clinical trials and provide evidence for the potential of lapatinib as an effective agent in the context of the biology and heterogeneity of its targets in ATRT.",

A complementation analysis based on microcell-mediated chromosome transfer (MMCT) using a centric fragment of chromosome 3 (der3p12-q12.1) into the OV-90 ovarian cancer cell line haploinsufficient for 3p and lacking VGLL3 expression was performed to assess the effect on tumorigenic potential and growth characteristics. Genetic characterization of the derived MMCT hybrids revealed that only the hybrid that contained an intact VGLL3 locus exhibited alterations of tumorigenic potential in a nude mouse xenograft model and various in\u00a0vitro growth characteristics. Only stable OV-90 transfectant clones expressing low levels of VGLL3 were derived. These clones exhibited an altered cytoplasmic morphology characterized by numerous single membrane bound multivesicular-bodies (MVB) that were not attributed to autophagy. Overexpression of VGLL3 in OV-90 was achieved using a lentivirus-based tetracycline inducible gene expression system, which also resulted in MVB formation in the infected cell population. Though there was no significant differences in various in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo growth characteristics in a comparison of VGLL3-expressing clones with empty vector transfectant controls, loss of VGLL3 expression was observed in tumors derived from mouse xenograft models. VGLL3 gene and protein expression was significantly reduced in HGSC samples (>98%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) relative to either normal ovarian surface epithelial cells or epithelial cells of the fallopian tube, possible tissues of origin of HGSC. Also, there appeared to be to be more cases with higher staining levels in stromal tissue component from HGSC cases that had a prolonged disease-free survival. The results taken together suggest that VGLL3 is involved in tumor suppressor pathways, a feature that is characterized by the absence of VGLL3 expression in HGSC samples.",

In this study, we introduced the human parental neural stem cells, HB1.F3, with the human interferon beta (IFN-\u03b2) gene which is a typical cytokine gene that has an antitumor effect and the cytosine deaminase (CD) gene from Escherichia coli (E. coli) that could convert the non-toxic prodrug, 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC), to a toxic metabolite, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Two types of stem cells expressing the CD gene (HB1.F3.CD cells) and both the CD and human IFN-\u03b2 genes (HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2) were generated. The present study was performed to examine the migratory and therapeutic effects of these GESTECs against the colorectal cancer cell line, HT-29. When co-cultured with colorectal cancer cells in the presence of 5-FC, HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 cells exhibited the cytotoxicity on HT-29 cells via the bystander effect. In particular, HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 cells showed the synergistic cytotoxic activity of 5-FU and IFN-\u03b2. We also confirmed the migration ability of HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 cells toward HT-29 cells by a modified migration assay in\u00a0vitro, where chemoattractant factors secreted by HT-29 cells attracted the GESTECs.

The LSD1\u2013JMJD2 complex functions as a transcriptional co-regulator of hormone activated androgen and estrogen receptors at specific gene promoters. LSD1 also regulates DNA methylation and p53 function. LSD1 is overexpressed in numerous cancers including prostate cancer through an unknown mechanism. We investigated expression of the LSD1 and JMJD2A in malignant human prostate specimens. We correlated LSD1 and JMJD2A expression with known mediators of prostate cancer progression: VEGF-A and cyclin A1. We show that elevated expression of LSD1, but not JMJD2A, correlates with prostate cancer recurrence and with increased VEGF-A expression. We show that functional depletion of LSD1 expression using siRNA in prostate cancer cells decreases VEGF-A and blocks androgen induced VEGF-A, PSA and Tmprss2 expression. We demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 reduces proliferation of both androgen dependent (LnCaP) and independent cell lines (LnCaP: C42, PC3). We show a direct mechanistic link between LSD1 over-expression and increased activity of pro-angiogenic pathways. New therapies targeting LSD1 activity should be useful in the treatment of hormone dependent and independent prostate cancer.",

The aim of this study is to comprehensively characterise the BRCA1/2 status of a large panel of ovarian cancer cell lines available to the research community to assist in biomarker studies of novel drugs and in particular of PARP inhibitors.The BRCA1/2 genes were sequenced in 41 ovarian cell lines, mRNA expression of BRCA1/2 and gene methylation status of BRCA1 was also examined. The cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors olaparib and veliparib was examined in 20 cell lines.The cell line SNU-251 has a deleterious BRCA1 mutation at 5564G\u00a0>\u00a0A, and is the only deleterious BRCA1/2 mutant in the panel. Two cell lines (UPN-251 and PEO1) had deleterious mutations as well as additional reversion mutations that restored the protein functionality. Heterozygous mutations in BRCA1/2 were relatively common, found in 14.6% of cell lines. BRCA1 was methylated in two cell lines (OVCAR8, A1847) and there was a corresponding decrease in gene expression. The BRCA1 methylated cell lines were more sensitive to PARP inhibition than wild-type cells. The SNU-251 deleterious mutant was more sensitive to PARP inhibition, but only in a long-term exposure to correct for its slow growth rate. Cell lines derived from metastatic disease are significantly more resistant to veliparib (2.0 fold p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) compared to those derived from primary tumours. Resistance to olaparib and veliparib was correlated Pearsons-R 0.5393, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0311.The incidence of BRCA1/2 deleterious mutations 1/41 cell lines derived from 33 different patients (3.0%) is much lower than the population incidence. The reversion mutations and high frequency of heterozygous mutations suggest that there is a selective pressure against BRCA1/2 in cell culture similar to the selective pressure seen in the clinic after treatment with chemotherapy.

Here, we explored the complement-mediated anti-tumor effects of trastuzumab and pertuzumab on HER2-positive tumor cells of various histological origins.Delivery of chemically stabilized anti-mCRP siRNAs using cationic lipoplexes, AtuPLEXes, to HER2-over-expressing BT474, SK-BR-3 (breast), SKOV3 (ovarian) and Calu-3 (lung) cancer cells reduced mCRPs expression by 85\u201395%. Knockdown of individual complement regulators variably led to increased CDC only upon combined treatment with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

In addition, antibody-induced C3 opsonization of tumor cells was significantly enhanced after mCRP silencing and further augmented tumor cell killing by macrophages.Our findings suggest that siRNA-induced inhibition of complement regulator expression clearly enhances complement- and macrophage-mediated anti-tumor activity of trastuzumab and pertuzumab on HER2-positive tumor cells.

Meanwhile, the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in MCF-7/TAM cells was significantly up-regulated both in mRNA level and protein level, and the expression of ER-\u03b166 was greatly down-regulated oppositely. In the subsequent studies, we overexpressed ER-\u03b136 in MCF-7 cells by stable transfection and found that ER-\u03b136 transfected MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/ER-\u03b136) similarly exhibited decreased sensitivity to TAM, accelerated proliferative rate and enhanced in\u00a0vitro migratory and invasive ability, compared to empty vector transfected MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/V). Real-time qPCR and Western blotting analysis revealed that MCF-7/ER-\u03b136 cells possessed increased EGFR expression but decreased ER-\u03b166 expression both in mRNA level and protein level, compared to MCF-7/V cells. This change in MCF-7/ER-\u03b136 cells could be reversed by neutralizing anti-ER-\u03b136 antibody treatment. Furthermore, knock-down of ER-\u03b136 expression in MCF-7/TAM cells resulted in reduced proliferation rate together with decreased in\u00a0vitro migratory and invasive ability. Decreased EGFR mRNA and protein expression as well as increased ER-\u03b166 mRNA expression were also observed in MCF-7/TAM cells with down-regulated ER-\u03b136 expression. In addition, blocking EGFR/ERK signaling in MCF-7/ER-\u03b136 cells could restore the expression of ER-\u03b166 partly, suggesting a regulatory function of EGFR/ERK signaling in down-regulation of ER-\u03b166 expression. In conclusion, our results indicated for the first time a regulatory role of ER-\u03b136 in up-regulation of EGFR expression and down-regulation of ER-\u03b166 expression, which could be an underlying mechanism for the growth status switch in breast tumors that contribute to the generation of acquired TAM resistance. And ER-\u03b136 could be considered a potential new therapeutic target in breast tumors which have acquired resistance to\u00a0TAM.",

With an overall objective response rate of approximately 50% for either treatment combination, a major unsolved problem is that no predictors of response to these treatments are available. To address this issue, we profiled 742 microRNAs in laser-capture microdissected cancer cells from responding and non-responding patients receiving XELOX/FOLFOX as first-line treatment for mCRC, and identified, among others, high expression of miR-625-3p, miR-181b and miR-27b to be associated with poor clinical response. In a validation cohort of 94 mCRC patients treated first-line with XELOX, high expression of miR-625-3p was confirmed to be associated with poor response (OR\u00a0=\u00a06.25, 95%CI [1.8; 21.0]). Independent analyses showed that miR-625-3p was not dysregulated between normal and cancer samples, nor was its expression associated with recurrence of stage II or III disease, indicating that miR-625-3p solely is a response marker. Finally, we also found that these miRNAs were up-regulated in oxaliplatin resistant HCT116/oxPt (miR-625-3p, miR-181b and miR-27b) and LoVo/oxPt (miR-181b) colon cancer cell lines as compared with their isogenic parental cells. Altogether, our results suggest an association between miR-625-3p and response to first-line oxaliplatin based chemotherapy of mCRC.",

     "abstract": "Amplification of 3q26.2, found in many cancer lineages, is a frequent and early event in ovarian cancer. We previously defined the most frequent region of copy number increase at 3q26.2 to EVI1 (ecotropic viral integration site-1) and MDS1 (myelodysplastic syndrome 1) (aka MECOM), an observation recently confirmed by the cancer genome atlas (TCGA). MECOM is increased at the DNA, RNA, and protein level and likely contributes to patient outcome. Herein, we report that EVI1 is aberrantly spliced, generating multiple variants including a Del190\u2013515 variant (equivalent to previously reported) expressed in >90% of advanced stage serous epithelial ovarian cancers. Although EVI1Del190\u2013515 lacks \u223c70% of exon 7, it binds CtBP1 as well as SMAD3, important mediators of TGF\u03b2 signaling, similar to wild type EVI1. This contrasts with EVI1 1\u2013268 which failed to interact with CtBP1. Interestingly, the EVI1Del190\u2013515 splice variant preferentially localizes to PML nuclear bodies compared to wild type and EVI1Del427\u2013515. While wild type EVI1 efficiently repressed TGF\u03b2-mediated AP-1 (activator protein-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoters, EVI1Del190\u2013515 elicited a slight increase in both promoter activities. Expression of EVI1 and EVI1Del427\u2013515 (but not EVI1Del190\u2013515) in OVCAR8 ovarian cancer cells increased cyclin E1 LMW expression and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, knockdown of specific EVI1 splice variants (both MDS1/EVI1 and EVI1Del190\u2013515) markedly increased claudin-1 mRNA and protein expression in HEY ovarian and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Changes in claudin-1 were associated with alterations in specific epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition markers concurrent with reduced migratory potential.

     "abstract": "C13ORF18 is frequently hypermethylated in cervical cancer but not in normal cervix and might serve as a biomarker for the early detection of cervical cancer in scrapings. As hypermethylation is often observed for silenced tumor suppressor genes (TSGs), hypermethylated biomarker genes might exhibit tumor suppressive activities upon re-expression. Epigenetic drugs are successfully exploited to reverse TSG silencing, but act genome-wide. Artificial Transcription Factors (ATFs) provide a gene-specific approach for re-expression of silenced genes. Here, we investigated the potential tumor suppressive role of C13ORF18 in cervical cancer by ATF-induced re-expression.Five zinc finger proteins were engineered to bind the C13ORF18 promoter and fused to a strong transcriptional activator. C13ORF18 expression could be induced in cervical cell lines: ranging from >40-fold in positive (C13ORF18-unmethylated) cells to >110-fold in negative (C13ORF18-methylated) cells. Re-activation of C13ORF18 resulted in significant cell growth inhibition and/or induction of apoptosis. Co-treatment of cell lines with ATFs and epigenetic drugs further enhanced the ATF-induced effects. Interestingly, re-activation of C13ORF18 led to partial demethylation of the C13ORF18 promoter and decreased repressive histone methylation. These data demonstrate the potency of ATFs to re-express and potentially demethylate hypermethylated silenced genes. Concluding, we show that C13ORF18 has a TSG function in cervical cancer and may serve as a therapeutic anti-cancer target. As the amount of epimutations in cancer exceeds the number of gene mutations, ATFs provide promising tools to validate hypermethylated marker genes as therapeutic targets.",

Whole blood was collected at baseline, at one of three short term time windows (24, 48, or 72\u00a0h) after initiating treatment, and at first follow-up (3\u20135 weeks). CTC were isolated, enumerated, and expression of M30 and Bcl2 was determined using the CellSearch\u00ae System.At baseline, window, and 3\u20135 weeks post-treatment, 41/80 (51%), 40/80 (50%) and 21/75 (28%) patients had \u22655 CTC, respectively. At baseline, the proportion of CTC-apoptosis (M30) was inversely correlated with CTC number, and modestly inversely correlated with CTC-Bcl-2. As expected, higher CTC levels at baseline or first follow-up were associated with worse prognosis. Surprisingly, in patients with elevated CTC, higher levels of CTC-apoptosis were associated with worse prognosis, while higher CTC-Bcl-2 levels correlated with better outcomes.CTC apoptosis and expression of Bcl-2 can be analytically determined in patients with metastatic breast cancer and may have biological and clinical implications. Characterization of CTC for these and other markers could further increase the utility of CTC monitoring patients in clinical investigations of new anti-neoplastic agents.",

The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is of importance for proliferation, survival and differentiation of hematopoietic cells and is frequently mutated in acute myeloid leukemia. We observed that SOCS2 associates with activated FLT3 through phosphotyrosine residues 589 and 919, and co-localizes with FLT3 in the cell membrane. SOCS2 increases FLT3 ubiquitination and accelerates receptor degradation in proteasomes. SOCS2 negatively regulates FLT3 signaling by blocking activation of Erk 1/2 and STAT5. Furthermore, SOCS2 expression leads to a decrease in FLT3-ITD-mediated cell proliferation and colony formation. Thus, we suggest that SOCS2 associates with activated FLT3 and negatively regulates the FLT3 signaling pathways.",

     "abstract": "For a panel of cancer related proteins, the aim was to shed light on which molecular level the expression of each protein was mainly regulated in breast tumors, and to investigate whether differences in regulation were reflected in different molecular subtypes. DNA, mRNA and protein lysates from 251 breast tumor specimens were analyzed using appropriate microarray technologies. Data from all three levels were available for 52 proteins selected for their known involvement in cancer, primarily through the PI3K/Akt pathway. For every protein, in cis Spearman rank correlations between the three molecular levels were calculated across all samples and within each intrinsic gene expression subtype, enabling 63 comparisons altogether due to multiple gene probes matching to single proteins. Subtype-specific relationships between the three molecular levels were studied by calculating the variance of subtype-specific correlation and differences between overall and average subtype-specific correlation. The findings were validated in an external dataset comprising 703 breast tumor specimens. The proteins were sorted into four groups based on the calculated rank correlation values between the three molecular levels. Group A consisted of eight proteins with significant correlation between DNA copy number levels and mRNA expression, and between mRNA expression and protein expression (Bonferroni adjusted p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Group B consisted of 14 proteins with significant correlation between mRNA expression and protein expression. Group C consisted of 15 proteins with significant correlation between copy number levels and mRNA expression. For the remaining 25 proteins (group D), no significant correlations was observed. Stratification of tumors according to intrinsic subtype enabled identification of positive correlations between copy number levels, mRNA and protein expression that were undetectable when considering the entire sample set. Protein pairings that either demonstrated high variance in correlation values between subtypes, or between subtypes and the total dataset were studied in particular. The protein expression of cleaved caspase 7 was most highly expressed, and correlated highest to CASP7 gene expression within the basal-like subtype, accompanied by the lowest amounts of hsa-miR-29c. Luminal A-like subtype demonstrated highest amounts of hsa-miR-29c (a miRNA with a putative target sequence in CASP7 mRNA), low expression of cleaved caspase 7 and low correlation to CASP7 gene expression. Such pattern might be an indication of hsa-miR-29c miRNA functioning as a repressor of translation of CASP7 within the luminal-A subtype. Across the entire cohort no correlation was found between CCNB1 copy number and gene expression. However, within most gene intrinsic subtypes, mRNA and protein expression of cyclin B1 was found positively correlated to copy number data, suggesting that copy number can affect the overall expression of this protein. Aberrations of cyclin B1 copy number also identified patients with reduced overall survival within each subtype. Based on correlation between the three molecular levels, genes and their products could be sorted into four groups for which the expression was likely to be regulated at different molecular levels. Further stratification suggested subtype-specific regulation that was not evident across the entire sample set.",

STn was also found in tumour-adjacent mucosa, which suggests its dependence on a field effect of the tumour. Furthermore, it was not expressed by the normal urothelium, demonstrating the cancer-specific nature of this antigen. STn expression correlated with that of sialyltransferase ST6GalNAc.I, its major biosynthetic enzyme.

A substantial fraction of breast cancers have acquired mutations that lead to activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, which plays a central role in cellular processes that are essential in cancer, such as cell survival, growth, division and motility. Oncogenic mutations in the PI3K pathway generally involve either activating mutation of the gene encoding PI3K (PIK3CA) or AKT (AKT1), or loss or reduced expression of PTEN. Several kinases involved in PI3K signaling are being explored as a therapeutic targets for pharmacological inhibition. Despite the availability of a range of inhibitors, acquired resistance may limit the efficacy of single-agent therapy. In this review we discuss the role of PI3K pathway mutations in human breast cancer and relevant genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), with special attention to the role of PI3K signaling in oncogenesis, in therapeutic response, and in resistance to therapy. Several sophisticated GEMMs have revealed the cause-and-effect relationships between PI3K pathway mutations and mammary oncogenesis.

     "abstract": "Lung cancer is a devastating disease and a major therapeutic burden with poor survival rates. It is responsible for 30% of all cancer deaths. Lung cancer is strongly associated with smoking, although some subtypes are also seen in non-smokers. Tumors in the latter group are mostly adenocarcinomas with many carrying mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Survival statistics of lung cancer are grim because of its late detection and frequent local and distal metastases. Although DNA sequence information from tumors has revealed a number of frequently occurring mutations, affecting well-known tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes, many of the driver mutations remain ill defined. This is likely due to the involvement of numerous rather infrequently occurring driver mutations that are difficult to distinguish from the very large number of passenger mutations detected in smoking-related lung cancers. Therefore, experimental model systems are indispensable to validate putative driver lesions and to gain insight into their mechanisms of action. Whereas a large fraction of these analyzes can be performed in cell cultures in\u00a0vitro, in many cases the consequences of the mutations have to be assessed in the context of an intact organism, as this is the context in which the Mendelian selection process of the tumorigenic process took place and the advantages of particular mutations become apparent. Current mouse models for cancer are very suitable for this as they permit mimicking many of the salient features of human tumors. The capacity to swiftly re-engineer complex sets of lesions found in human tumors in mice enables us to assess the contribution of defined combinations of lesions to distinct tumor characteristics such as metastatic behavior and response to therapy. In this review we will describe mouse models of lung cancer and how they are used to better understand the disease and how they are exploited to develop better intervention strategies.",

Deep sequencing of PDAC tumors has revealed the presence of a high number of mutations (>50) that affect at least a dozen key signaling pathways. This scenario highlights the urgent need to develop experimental models that faithfully reproduce the natural history of these human tumors in order to understand their biology and to design therapeutic approaches that might effectively interfere with their multiple mutated pathways. Over the last decade, several models, primarily based on the genetic activation of resident KRas oncogenes knocked-in within the endogenous KRas locus have been generated. These models faithfully reproduce the histological lesions that characterize human pancreatic tumors. Decoration of these models with additional mutations, primarily involving tumor suppressor loci known to be also mutated in human PDAC tumors, results in accelerated tumor progression and in the induction of invasive and metastatic malignancies. Mouse PDACs also display a desmoplastic stroma and inflammatory responses that closely resemble those observed in human patients. Interestingly, adult mice appear to be resistant to PDAC development unless the animals undergo pancreatic damage, mainly in the form of acute, chronic or even temporary pancreatitis. In this review, we describe the most representative models available to date and how their detailed characterization is allowing us to understand their cellular origin as well as the events involved in tumor progression. Moreover, their molecular dissection is starting to unveil novel therapeutic strategies that could be translated to the clinic in the very near future.",

MYC overexpression has been targeted to several tissues using transgenic constructs, and more recently as mouse models have evolved, conditional systems have been developed to allow the regulation of MYC expression or activity in\u00a0vivo. The ability to target MYC expression to specific tissues and cell lineages, as well as the ability to regulate that expression, has made genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) a valuable resource for studying the importance of MYC in the process of tumourigenesis. Here we review how these models have been used to address the role of MYC in tumour initiation and maintenance, how subtle changes in levels of MYC can influence tumourigenesis, and finally the ongoing efforts to target endogenous MYC genetically and with novel therapies.",

     "abstract": "The formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) is required for the growth of most tumors. The tumor microenvironment also induces lymphangiogenic factors that promote metastatic spread. Anti-angiogenic therapy targets the mechanisms behind the growth of the tumor vasculature. During the past two decades, several strategies targeting blood and lymphatic vessels in tumors have been developed. The blocking of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) signaling has proven effective for inhibition of tumor angiogenesis and growth, and inhibitors of VEGF-C/VEGFR-3 involved in lymphangiogenesis have recently entered clinical trials. However, thus far anti-angiogenic treatments have been less effective in humans than predicted on the basis of pre-clinical tests in mice. Intrinsic and induced resistance against anti-angiogenesis occurs in patients, and thus far the clinical benefit of the treatments has been limited to modest improvements in overall survival in selected tumor types. Our current knowledge of tumor angiogenesis is based mainly on experiments performed in tumor-transplanted mice, and it has become evident that these models are not representative of human cancer. For an improved understanding, angiogenesis research needs models that better recapitulate the multistep tumorigenesis of human cancers, from the initial genetic insults in single cells to malignant progression in a proper tissue environment. To improve anti-angiogenic therapies in cancer patients, it is necessary to identify additional molecular targets important for tumor angiogenesis, and to get mechanistic insight into their interactions for eventual combinatorial targeting. The recent development of techniques for manipulating the mammalian genome in a precise and predictable manner has opened up new possibilities for the generation of more reliable models of human cancer that are essential for the testing of new therapeutic strategies. In addition, new imaging modalities that permit visualization of the entire mouse tumor vasculature down to the resolution of single capillaries have been developed in pre-clinical models and will likely benefit clinical imaging.",

Recent years have brought impressive progress in metastasis research, yet we still lack sufficient insights into how cancer cells migrate out of primary tumors and invade into neighboring tissue, intravasate into the blood or the lymphatic circulation, survive in the blood stream, and target specific organs to initiate metastatic outgrowth. While a large number of cellular and animal models of cancer have been crucial in delineating the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor initiation and progression, experimental models that faithfully recapitulate the multiple stages of metastatic disease are still scarce. The advent of sophisticated genetic engineering in mice, in particular the ability to manipulate gene expression in specific tissue and at desired time points at will, have allowed to rebuild the metastatic process in mice. Here, we describe a selection of cellular experimental systems, tumor transplantation mouse models and genetically engineered mouse models that are used for monitoring specific processes involved in metastasis, such as cell migration and invasion, and for investigating the full metastatic process. Such models not only aid in deciphering the pathomechanisms of metastasis, but are also instrumental for the preclinical testing of anti-metastatic therapies and further refinement and generation of improved models.",

Wider adoption of specific aspects of westernized lifestyles would translate to still greater increases in certain cancer types. In many countries the burden of cancer and other non-communicable diseases will add to communicable diseases and malnutrition to impose a \u201cdouble burden\u201d on the poorest. These trends represent major challenges to health, poverty, sustainable development and equality. Prevention is, however, possible based on implementing existing knowledge about risk factors and the natural history of the disease. Both primary and secondary cancer prevention offer therefore many opportunities to combat the projected increases. Tobacco control, reductions in obesity and physical inactivity, reduced consumption of alcohol, vaccination against hepatitis B and human papilloma viruses, safe sex, avoidance of environmental and occupational carcinogens and excessive sun exposure as well as the early detection and screening for breast, cervix and colorectal cancers would all make significant contributions. At the same time, for a number of major cancers (e.g., colon, prostate, kidney, pancreas, brain, lympho-haematological malignancies) research is needed to identify as yet unknown risk factors whilst for existing prevention strategies additional work is needed on their implementation into health services. Finally, there is a remarkable opportunity for advances in understanding the molecular basis of carcinogenesis to provide new tools and insights into aetiology and prevention. It is only by complementing efforts to improve treatment with those aimed at prevention that the impending epidemic of this disease can be addressed.",

     "abstract": "Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract, and the incidence and mortality rates from this disease are increasing. Although endometrial carcinoma has been regarded as a tissue-specific disease mediated by female sex steroid pathways, considerable evidence implicates a role for an inflammatory response in the development and propagation of endometrial cancer. We hypothesized that if specific patterns of cytokine expression were found to be predictive of adverse outcome, then selective receptor targeting may be a therapeutic option. This study was therefore undertaken to determine the relationship between cytokine production in primary cell culture and clinical outcome in endometrial adenocarcinoma. Fresh endometrial tissues were fractionated into epithelial and stromal fractions and cultured. After 6\u20137 days, supernatants were collected and cells enumerated. Batched aliquots were assayed using ELISA kits specific for CSF-1, GMCSF, G-CSF, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF. Data were compared using ANOVA, Fisher's exact, and log rank tests. Increased epithelial VEGF production was observed more often in tumors with Type 2 variants (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039) and when GPR30 receptor expression was high (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038). Although increased stromal VEGF production was detected more often in grade 3 endometrioid tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.050), when EGFR expression was high (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and/or when ER/PR expression was low (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), VEGF production did not correlated with overall survival (OS). Increased epithelial CSF-1 and TNF-\u03b1 production, respectively, were observed more often in tumors with deep myometrial invasion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) and advanced stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Increased CSF-1 (89.5% vs. 42.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.032), TNF-\u03b1 (88.9% vs. 42.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.032, and IL-6 (92.3% vs. 61.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.052) also correlated with low OS.

Recently, we generated an improved version of phage vectors by incorporating cis genetic elements of adeno-associated virus (AAV). This novel AAV/phage hybrid (AAVP) efficiently delivered systemically administered therapeutic genes to various tumor targets by displaying an integrin tumor-targeting ligand on the phage capsid. However, inherent limitations in bacteriophage mean that these AAVP vectors still need to be improved. One of the limitations of AAVP in mammalian cells may be its susceptibility to proteasomal degradation. The proteasome is upregulated in cancer and it is known that it constitutes a barrier to gene delivery by certain eukaryotic viruses. We report here that inhibition of proteasome improved targeted reporter gene delivery by AAVP in cancer cells in\u00a0vitro and in tumors in\u00a0vivo after intravenous vector administration to tumor-bearing mice. We also show enhanced targeted tumor cell killing by AAVP upon proteasome inhibition. The AAVP particles persisted significantly in cancer cells in\u00a0vitro and in tumors in\u00a0vivo after systemic administration, and accumulated polyubiquitinated coat proteins. Our results suggest that the proteasome is indeed a barrier to tumor targeting by AAVP and indicate that a combination of proteasome-inhibiting drugs and AAVP should be considered for clinical anticancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Some endocytic proteins have recently been shown to play a role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that APPL2, an adapter protein with known endocytic functions, is upregulated in 40% cases of glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and aggressive cancer of the central nervous system. The silencing of APPL2 expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) in glioma cells markedly reduces cell survival under conditions of low growth factor availability and enhances apoptosis (measured by executor caspase activity). Long-term depletion of APPL2 by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), under regular growth factor availability, suppresses the cell transformation abilities, assessed by inhibited colony formation in soft agar and by reduced xenograft tumor growth in\u00a0vivo. At the molecular level, the negative effect of APPL2 knockdown on cell survival is not due to the alterations in AKT or GSK3\u03b2 activities which were reported to be modulated by APPL proteins. Instead, we attribute the reduced cell survival upon APPL2 depletion to the changes in gene expression, in particular to the upregulation of apoptosis-related genes, such as UNC5B (a proapoptotic dependence receptor) and HRK (harakiri, an activator of apoptosis, which antagonizes anti-apoptotic function of Bcl2). In support of this notion, the loss of glioma cell survival upon APPL2 knockdown can be rescued either by an excess of netrin-1, the prosurvival ligand of UNC5B or by simultaneous silencing of HRK. Consistently, APPL2 overexpression reduces expression of HRK and caspase activation in cells treated with apoptosis inducers, resulting in the enhancement of cell viability. This prosurvival activity of APPL2 is independent of its endosomal localization. Cumulatively, our data indicate that a high level of APPL2 protein might enhance glioblastoma growth by maintaining low expression level of genes responsible for cell death induction.",

     "abstract": "The majority of genes associated with breast cancer susceptibility, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, are involved in DNA repair mechanisms. Moreover, among the genes recently associated with an increased susceptibility to breast cancer, four are Fanconi Anemia (FA) genes: FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCJ/BACH1/BRIP1, FANCN/PALB2 and FANCO/RAD51C. FANCA is implicated in DNA repair and has been shown to interact directly with BRCA1. It has been proposed that the formation of FANCA/G (dependent upon the phosphorylation of FANCA) and FANCB/L sub-complexes altogether with FANCM, represent the initial step for DNA repair activation and subsequent formation of other sub-complexes leading to ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI. As only approximately 25% of inherited breast cancers are attributable to BRCA1/2 mutations, FANCA therefore becomes an attractive candidate for breast cancer susceptibility. We thus analyzed FANCA gene in 97 high-risk French Canadian non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer individuals by direct sequencing as well as in 95 healthy control individuals from the same population. Among a total of 85 sequence variants found in either or both series, 28 are coding variants and 19 of them are missense variations leading to amino acid change. Three of the amino acid changes, namely Thr561Met, Cys625Ser and particularly Ser1088Phe, which has been previously reported to be associated with FA, are predicted to be damaging by the SIFT and PolyPhen softwares. cDNA amplification revealed significant expression of 4 alternative splicing events (insertion of an intronic portion of intron 10, and the skipping of exons 11, 30 and 31). In silico analyzes of relevant genomic variants have been performed in order to identify potential variations involved in the expression of these spliced transcripts. Sequence variants in FANCA could therefore be potential spoilers of the Fanconi-BRCA pathway and as a result, they could in turn have an impact in non-BRCA1/2 breast cancer families.",

The frequencies of aberration in the TOP1 gene copy number, the CEN-20 copy number and the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio were analyzed and associated with overall survival (OS), time to recurrence (TTR) and in a subgroup analysis of rectal cancer patients only with time to local recurrence (LR in RC). Moreover, the TOP1 and CEN-20 copy numbers were correlated with the tumor Ki67 proliferation index.35.7% of the tumors had an increased TOP1 copy number above 4n gene copies per cell and 28.6% and 9.7% had a TOP1/CEN-20 ratio \u22651.5 or \u22652.0, respectively. The TOP1 copy number and the TOP1/CEN-20 ratios were separately added into multivariate analyses as continuous variables, in which also age, gender, primary tumor location and Ki67 status were added as covariates. In contrast to the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio, the TOP1 copy number was significantly associated with OS (HR: 0.62; 95% CI: 0.42\u20130.90; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Neither the TOP1 copy number nor the ratio was significantly associated with TTR and only the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio was significantly associated with LR in RC (HR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.08\u20130.83; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). No significant correlation was found between the TOP1 copy number and proliferation, while a weak and inverse correlation between the CEN-20 copy number and proliferation was observed.This study showed that increased TOP1 gene copy numbers are frequent findings in cancer cells in stage III CRC tumors but unrelated to the proliferative status of the tumors.

Acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs develops after prolonged treatments. The study was prompt to explore effective strategies against resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We established gefitinib resistant PC-9 cells which harbor EGFR exon 19 deletion. Known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired EGFR-TKI resistance, including KRAS mutation, HER2 mutation, EGFR T790M mutation and MET gene amplification, were studied, and we did not observe any known mechanisms for intrinsic or acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in the resistant cells. In the parental PC-9 cells, labeled as PC-9/wt, gefitinib completely inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR, AKT and ERK. Gefitinib inhibited EGFR phosphorylation, but was unable to block EGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK in resistant cells, labeled as PC-9/gef cells, including PC-9/gefB4, PC-9/gefE3, and PC-9/gefE7 subclones. We detected NRAS Q61K mutation in the PC-9/gef cells but not the PC-9/wt cells. MEK inhibitors, either AZD6244 or CI1040, inhibited ERK phosphorylation and sensitized gefitinib-induced cytotoxicity in PC-9/gef cells. Whereas MEK inhibitors or gefitinib alone did not activate caspases in PC-9/gef cells, combination of gefitinib and AZD6244 or CI1040 induced apoptosis. Our in\u00a0vivo studies showed that gefitinib inhibited growth of PC-9/wt xenografts but not PC-9/gef xenografts. Furthermore, combination of a MEK inhibitor and gefitinib inhibited growth of both PC-9/wt xenografts and PC-9/gefB4 xenografts. To conclude, persistent activation of ERK pathway contributes to the acquired gefitinib-resistance. Combined treatment of gefitinib and MEK inhibitors may be therapeutically useful for acquired gefitinib-resistance lung adenocarcinoma cells harboring EGFR mutations.",

Identifying robust biomarkers for selecting patients who may benefit from such treatment and for monitoring response is important for the future use of bevacizumab.Two established xenograft models representing basal-like and luminal-like breast cancer were used to study bevacizumab treatment response on the metabolic and gene expression levels. Tumor samples were obtained from mice treated with bevacizumab, doxorubicin or a combination of the two drugs, and high resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy and gene expression microarray analysis was performed.Combination treatment with bevacizumab showed the strongest growth inhibiting effect in basal-like tumors, and this was reflected by a significant change in the metabolomic and transcriptomic profiles. In the luminal-like xenografts, addition of bevacizumab did not improve the effect of doxorubicin. On the global transcriptomic level, the largest gene expression changes were observed for the most efficient treatment in both models.

     "abstract": "DNA methylation plays a key role in the silencing of numerous cancer-related genes, thereby affecting a number of vital cellular processes, including the cell cycle checkpoint, apoptosis, signal transduction, cell adhesion and angiogenesis. Also widely altered in human malignancies is the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs that act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Furthermore, emerging evidence now supports the idea that DNA methylation is crucially involved in the dysregulation of miRNAs in cancer. This is in part the result of technological advances that enable more comprehensive analysis of miRNA expression profiles and the epigenome in cancer cells, which has led to the identification of a number of epigenetically regulated miRNAs. As with protein-coding genes, it appears that miRNA genes involved in regulating cancer-related pathways are silenced in association with CpG island hypermethylation. In addition, methylation in CpG island shore regions and DNA hypomethylation also appear to contribute to miRNA dysregulation in cancer. Aberrant DNA methylation of miRNA genes is a potentially useful biomarker for detecting cancer and predicting its outcome. Moreover, re-expression of miRNAs and the replacement of tumor suppressive miRNAs using miRNA mimics or expression vectors could be effective approaches to cancer therapy.",

Aberrant protein acetylation, particularly on histones, has been related to cancer while abnormal expression of HDACs has been found in a broad range of cancer types. Therefore, HDACs have emerged as promising targets in cancer therapeutics, and the development of HDAC inhibitors (HDIs), a rapidly evolving area of clinical research.

     "abstract": "Cancer cells are remarkably adaptive to diverse survival strategies, probably due to its ability to interpret signaling cues differently than the normal cells. It appears as if cancer cells are constantly sampling, selecting and adapting signaling pathways to favor its proliferation. This process of successful adaptive evolution eventually renders a retractile nature to therapeutic regimens, fueling to the process of cancer progression. Based on plethora of available information, it is now evident that multiple signaling pathways eventually converge, perhaps, in a tempo-spatial manner, onto DNA template-dependent dynamic processes. Considering the complexity and packaging of eukaryotic genome, this process involves energy-dependent sub-events mediated by chromatin remodelers. Chromatin remodeler proteins function as gatekeepers and constitute a major determinant of accessibility of accessory factors to nucleosome DNA, allowing a wide repertoire of biological functions. And thus, aberrant expression or epigenetic modulation of remodeler proteins confers a unique ability to cancer cells to reprogram its genome for the maintenance of oncogenic phenotypes. Cancer cells can uniquely select a multi-subunit remodeler proteome for oncogenic advantage. This review summarizes our current understanding and importance of remodeler and chromatin proteins in cancer biology and also highlights the paradoxical role of proteins with or without dual-regulator functions. It is our hope that an in-depth understanding of these events is likely to provide a next set of opportunities for novel strategies for targeted cancer therapeutics.",

Furthermore, CSCs have shown to be more resistant to anti-tumor treatments than the non-stem cancer cells, suggesting that surviving CSCs could be responsible for tumor relapse after therapy. These important properties have raised the interest in understanding the mechanisms that govern the generation and maintenance of this special population of cells, considered to lie behind the on/off switches of gene expression patterns.

     "abstract": "Abnormal epigenetic control is a common early event in tumour progression, and aberrant acetylation in particular has been implicated in tumourigenesis. One of the most promising approaches towards drugs that modulate epigenetic processes has been seen in the development of inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs regulate the acetylation of histones in nucleosomes, which mediates changes in chromatin conformation, leading to regulation of gene expression. HDACs also regulate the acetylation status of a variety of other non-histone substrates, including key tumour suppressor proteins and oncogenes. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs) are potent anti-proliferative agents which modulate acetylation by targeting histone deacetylases. Interest is increasing in HDI-based therapies and so far, two HDIs, vorinostat (SAHA) and romidepsin (FK228), have been approved for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Others are undergoing clinical trials. Treatment with HDIs prompts tumour cells to undergo apoptosis, and cell-based studies have shown a number of other outcomes to result from HDI treatment, including cell-cycle arrest, cell differentiation, anti-angiogenesis and autophagy. However, our understanding of the key pathways through which HDAC inhibitors affect tumour cell growth remains incomplete, which has hampered progress in identifying malignancies other than CTCL which are likely to respond to HDI treatment.",

Therefore the difference in cancer incidence has been estimated to be more than a 100,000-fold. This is astonishing, as both tissues share similar epithelial structure and hormonal cues. Clearly, the two epithelia differ substantially in the maintenance of genomic integrity, possibly due to inherent differences in their DNA damage burden and DNA damage signaling. The DNA damage response evoked by DNA double strand breaks may be relevant, as their faulty repair has been implicated in the formation of common genomic rearrangements such as TMPRSS2-ERG fusions during prostate carcinogenesis. Here, we review DNA damaging processes of both tissues with an emphasis on inflammation and androgen signaling. We discuss how benign prostate and seminal vesicle epithelia respond to acute DNA damage, focusing on the canonical DNA double strand break-induced ATM-pathway, p53 and DNA damage induced checkpoints. We propose that the prostate might be more prone to the accumulation of genetic aberrations during epithelial regeneration than seminal vesicles due to a weaker ability to enforce DNA damage checkpoints.",

     "abstract": "Persistent Jak/Stat3 signal transduction plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. Activated Jak/Stat3 signaling has been validated as a promising molecular target for cancer therapeutics discovery and development. Berbamine (BBM), a natural bis-benzylisoquinoline alkaloid, was identified from the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Berberis amurensis used for treatment of cancer patients. While BBM has been shown to have potent antitumor activities with low toxicity in various cancer types, the molecular mechanism of action of BBM remains largely unknown. Here, we determine the antitumor activities of 13 synthetic berbamine derivatives (BBMDs) against human solid tumor cells. BBMD3, which is the most potent in this series of novel BBMDs, exhibits over 6-fold increase in biological activity compared to natural BBM. Moreover, BBMD3, directly inhibits Jak2 autophosphorylation kinase activity in\u00a0vitro with IC50\u00a00.69\u00a0\u03bcM. Autophosphorylation of Jak2 kinase at Tyr1007/1008 sites also was strongly inhibited in the range of 15\u00a0\u03bcM of BBMD3 in human melanoma cells at 4\u00a0h after treatment. Following inhibition of autophosphorylation of Jak2, BBMD3 blocked constitutive activation of downstream Stat3 signaling in melanoma cells. BBMD3 also down-regulated expression of the Stat3 target proteins Mcl-1and Bcl-xL, associated with induction of apoptosis. In sum, our findings demonstrate that the novel berbamine derivative BBMD3 is an inhibitor of the Jak2/Stat3 signaling pathway, providing evidence for a molecular mechanism whereby BBMD3 exerts at least in part the apoptosis of human melanoma cells. In addition, BBMD3 represents a promising lead compound for development of new therapeutics for cancer treatment.",

H3K27me3 is characteristic of the chromatin at genes involved in developmental regulation in undifferentiated cells. Overexpression of EZH2 has been found in several cancer types such as breast, prostate, melanoma and bladder cancer. Moreover, overexpression is associated with highly proliferative and aggressive types of breast and prostate tumors. We have analyzed the abundance of EZH2 and H3K27me3 using immunohistochemistry in two large and well-characterized breast tumor data sets encompassing more than 400 tumors. The results have been analyzed in relation to the molecular subtypes of breast tumors (basal-like, luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched and normal-like), as well as in subtypes defined by clinical markers (triple negative, ER+/HER2\u2212/Ki67low, ER+/HER2\u2212/Ki67high and HER2+), and were validated in representative breast cancer cell lines by western blot. We found significantly different expression of both EZH2 and H3K27me3 across all subtypes with high abundance of EZH2 in basal-like, triple negative and HER2-enriched tumors, and high H3K27me3 in luminal A, HER2-enriched and normal-like tumors. Intriguingly, the two markers show an inverse correlation, particularly for the basal-like and triple negative tumors. Consequently, high expression of EZH2 was associated with poor distant disease-free survival whereas high expression of H3K27me3 was associated with better survival. Additionally, none of 182 breast tumors was found to carry a previously described EZH2 mutation affecting Tyr641. Our observation that increased expression of EZH2 does not necessarily correlate with increased abundance of H3K27me3 supports the idea that EZH2 can have effects beyond epigenetic silencing of target genes in breast cancer.",

We further show that the induction of this anti-apoptotic signalling pathway is based on upregulated expression of HER3 ligands, their shedding by the metalloprotease ADAM17, and is dependent on the HER2 receptor. The doxorubicin-mediated activation of this important survival cascade can be blocked by the kinase inhibitors lapatinib or erlotinib as well as by the therapeutic monoclonal antibody trastuzumab. Inhibition of the doxorubicin-induced activation of HER3-PI3K-AKT signalling significantly increased apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells. Besides doxorubicin, treatment of cells with cisplatin resulted in activation of the HER3 receptor whereas other chemotherapeutics did not show this effect. The increase in HER3 phosphorylation was detected in well-established ovarian cancer cell lines which originate from patients previously treated with these chemotherapeutic drugs.

Compared with either agent used alone, ZD55-IL-24 combined with radiotherapy significantly inhibited cell proliferation, accompanied with increased apoptosis. Radiotherapy did not affect the expression of IL-24 and E1A of ZD55-IL-24-treated cells, but increased the expression of Bax, promoted the activation of caspase-3, while decreasing Bcl-2 levels. Thus, this synergistic effect of ZD55-IL-24 in combination with radiotherapy provides a novel strategy for the development of melanoma therapies, and is a promising approach for further clinical development.",

We here suggest that sphingosine kinase-1 (SphK1) might be the key factor contributing to chemo-resistance in OS. Our Western-blots and immunohistochemistry results showed that SphK1 is over-expressed in multiple clinical OS tissues. Over-expression of SphK1 in OS cell line U2OS promoted its growth and endorsed its resistance against doxorubicin, while knocking-down of SphK1 by shRNA inhibited U2OS cell growth and increased its sensitivity to doxorubicin. Co-administration phenoxodiol with doxorubicin synergistically inhibited SphK1 activity to trigger cellular ceramide accumulation, and achieved synergistic anti-OS growth effect, accompanied with a significant increased of apoptosis and cytotoxicity. Increased cellular level of ceramide by the co-administration induced the association between Akt and Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) to dephosphorylate Akt, and to introduce a constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt) restored Akt activation and diminished cell growth inhibition. Further, phenoxodiol and doxorubicin synergistically activated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1(ASK1)/c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) signaling, which also contributed to cell growth inhibition. Significantly, the role of SphK1 in OS cell growth and the synergistic anti-OS effect of phenoxodiol and doxorubicin were also seen in a mice OS xenograft model. In conclusion, our data suggest that SphK1 might be a critical oncogene of OS and co-administration phenoxodiol with doxorubicin synergistically inhibited the activity of SphK1 to suppress osteosarcoma cell growth both in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro.",

     "abstract": "Lung carcinogenesis is a complex process in an unregulated inflammatory environment. Curcumin has been extensively investigated as a multi-target anti-tumor and anti-inflammation compound. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel inflammation-related mechanism for curcumin-induced inhibition of lung tumor growth. We found that neutrophil elastase, an important regulator of inflammatory processes, directly triggered tumor cell proliferation in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, and curcumin could completely suppress the excess tumor proliferation induced by neutrophil elastase. \u03b11-antitrypsin is synthesized by tumor cells and is the natural inhibitor of neutrophil elastase. We found that curcumin counteracted the decrease of \u03b11-antitrypsin induced by neutrophil elastase by inducing the promoter activity of \u03b11-antitrypsin and promoting its expression in A549 cells. The inhibition of neutrophil elastase-induced proliferation by curcumin was dependent on the PI3K/Akt pathway. Knockdown of \u03b11-antitrypsin by siRNA further enhanced the tumor cell proliferation induced by neutrophil elastase and significantly blocked the anti-proliferation effect of curcumin against neutrophil elastase. Curcumin remarkably inhibited the primary tumor growth of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) in C57BL/6 mice. We further showed that curcumin upregulated the level of \u03b11-antitrypsin in primary tumor tissue by promoting its local expression, and the protein level of neutrophil elastase in tumor tissue was obviously decreased in mice treated with curcumin. Overall, our results suggest that neutrophil elastase and \u03b11-antitrypsin play important roles in modulating lung tumor proliferation in inflammatory microenvironment and curcumin inhibits neutrophil elastase-induced tumor proliferation via upregulating \u03b11-antitrypsin expression in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo.",

One reason for the lack of overall survival benefit might be that appropriate criteria for selection of patients likely to respond to antiangiogenic therapy in combination with chemotherapy, are not available.To determine factors of importance for antiangiogenic treatment response and/or resistance, two representative human basal- and luminal-like breast cancer xenografts were treated with bevacizumab and doxorubicin alone or in combination. In\u00a0vivo growth inhibition, microvessel density (MVD) and proliferating tumor vessels (pMVD\u00a0=\u00a0proliferative microvessel density) were analysed, while kinase activity was determined using the PamChip Tyrosine kinase microarray system.Results showed that both doxorubicin and bevacizumab inhibited basal-like tumor growth significantly, but with a superior effect when given in combination. In contrast, doxorubicin inhibited luminal-like tumor growth most effectively, and with no additional benefit of adding antiangiogenic therapy. In agreement with the growth inhibition data, vascular characterization verified a more pronounced effect of the antiangiogenic treatment in the basal-like compared to the luminal-like tumors, demonstrating total inhibition of pMVD and a significant reduction in MVD at early time points (three days after treatment) and sustained inhibitory effects until the end of the experiment (day 18). In contrast, luminal-like tumors only showed significant effect on the vasculature at day 10 in the tumors having received both doxorubicin and bevacizumab.Kinase activity profiling in both tumor models demonstrated that the most effective treatment in\u00a0vivo was accompanied with increased phosphorylation of kinase substrates of growth control and angiogenesis, like EGFR, VEGFR2 and PLC\u03b31. This may be a result of\u00a0regulatory feedback mechanisms contributing to treatment resistance, and may suggest response markers of value for the prediction of antiangiogenic treatment efficacy.",

In the normal cells, these biological cascades depend on scheduled proteolytic degradation of regulatory proteins via the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway. Therefore, interruption of regulated proteolytic pathways leads to abnormal cell-proliferation. Ubiquitin ligases called SCF complex (consisting of Skp-1, cullin, and F-box protein) or CRL (cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase) are predominant in a family of E3 ubiquitin ligases that control a final step in ubiquitination of diverse substrates. To a great extent, the ubiquitin ligase activity of the SCF complex requires the conjugation of NEDD8 to cullins, i.e. scaffold proteins. This review is anticipated to review the downregulation system of NEDD8 conjugation by several factors including a chemical compound such as MLN4924 and protein molecules (e.g. COP9 signalosome, inactive mutant of Ubc12, and NUB1/NUB1L). Since the downregulation of NEDD8 conjugation affects cell-cycle progression by inhibiting the ligase activity of SCF complexes, such knowledge in the NEDD8-conjugation pathway will contribute to the more magnificent therapies that selectively suppress tumorigenesis.",

While previous studies indicate that indirubin is a promising therapeutic agent for CML, the molecular mechanism of action of indirubin is not fully understood. We report here that indirubin derivatives (IRDs) potently inhibit Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5 (Stat5) protein in CML cells. Compound E804, which is the most potent in this series of IRDs, blocked Stat5 signaling in human K562 CML cells, imatinib-resistant human KCL-22 CML cells expressing the T315I mutant Bcr-Abl (KCL-22M), and CD34-positive primary CML cells from patients. Autophosphorylation of Src family kinases (SFKs) was strongly inhibited in K562 and KCL-22M cells at 5\u00a0\u03bcM E804, and in primary CML cells at 10\u00a0\u03bcM E804, although higher concentrations partially inhibited autophosphorylation of Bcr-Abl. Previous studies indicate that SFKs cooperate with Bcr-Abl to activate downstream Stat5 signaling. Activation of Stat5 was strongly blocked by E804 in CML cells. E804 down-regulated expression of Stat5 target proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, associated with induction of apoptosis. In sum, our findings identify IRDs as potent inhibitors of the SFK/Stat5 signaling pathway downstream of Bcr-Abl, leading to apoptosis of K562, KCL-22M and primary CML cells.

Using orthotopic mouse tumor models, we now show that inducible knockdown of PKN3 protein not only blocks metastasis, but also impairs primary prostate and breast tumor growth. Correspondingly, overexpression of exogenous PKN3 in breast cancer cells further increases their malignant behavior and invasiveness in-vitro. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that PKN3 physically interacts with Rho-family GTPases, and preferentially with RhoC, a known mediator of tumor invasion and metastasis in epithelial cancers. Likewise, RhoC predominantly associates with PKN3 compared to its closely related PKN family members. Unlike the majority of Rho GTPases and PKN molecules, which are ubiquitously expressed, both PKN3 and RhoC show limited expression in normal tissues and become upregulated in late-stage malignancies. Since PKN3 catalytic activity is increased in the presence of Rho GTPases, the co-expression and preferential interaction of PKN3 and RhoC in tumor cells are functionally relevant. Our findings provide novel insight into the regulation and function of PKN3 and suggest that the PKN3\u2013RhoC complex represents an attractive therapeutic target in late-stage malignancies.",

The interactions of EGFR with MYH9 and \u03b2-actin were reduced in the presence of blebbistatin, a specific inhibitor for the MYH9-\u03b2-actin interaction, suggesting that the EGFR interaction with MYH9 and \u03b2-actin is affected by the integrity of the cytoskeleton.

Comparative proteomic analysis of HT1376 and HT1376-CisR cells revealed 36 differentially expressed proteins, wherein 21 proteins were upregulated and 15 were downregulated in HT1376-CisR cells. Among the differentially regulated proteins, adseverin (SCIN), a calcium-dependent actin-binding protein, was overexpressed (4-fold upregulation) in HT1376-CisR, with the increase being more prominent in the mitochondrial fraction than in the cytosol fraction. SCIN mRNA knockdown significantly reduced cell proliferation with mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in HT1376-CisR cells. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed voltage-dependent anion channels (VDACs) to be bound to SCIN in the mitochondrial fraction.

We decided to investigate tumor growth and angiogenesis in the absence of Shb in an inheritable tumor model, the RIP-Tag2 mouse, which produces insulinomas in a manner highly dependent on de novo angiogenesis. We observed a reduced tumor incidence and burden in both RIP-Tag2 Shb\u2212/\u2212 and RIP-Tag2 Shb+/\u2212 mice. This correlated with a reduced microvascular density, measured as a percentage of insulinoma area positive for CD31 staining, and altered vascular morphology. However, treatment with a VEGF-A blocking antibody was without effect on the Shb mutant tumor volume whereas it significantly inhibited tumor volume in the wild-type mice, suggesting that in mice with reduced Shb expression tumor angiogenesis was primarily sustained by VEGF-A independent pathway(s). This notion was further substantiated by gene expression analysis of angiogenic markers showing reduced VEGF-A expression in Shb-deficient tumors. Considerable heterogeneity with respect to the gene expression profiles of other angiogenic markers and the signal-transduction characteristics was observed between different tumors, suggesting that multiple \u201crescue\u201d pathways could be operating. The numbers of invasive tumors or metastases were unchanged in the Shb mutant.It is concluded that the Shb mutant background reduces tumor frequency by chronically suppressing VEGF-A dependent angiogenesis.

A subset of stable regions, including stable paralogous regions, were confirmed by quantitative PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in 5 breast cancer cell lines. We deduced a comprehensive set of dually stable genes (i.e. maintaining nominal copy number and expression) which were categorized according to pathway and ontology assignments. The stability of genes encoding therapeutic drug targets was also assessed.Tumour genome analysis revealed 766 unstable (amplified and/or deleted) and 812 stable contiguous genomic regions. Replication analysis of an independent set of 171 breast tumours confirmed copy number stability of 1.3\u00a0Gb of the genome. We found that 5804 of these genes were dually stable. The composition of this gene set remained essentially unchanged (<2% reduction) after accounting for commonly mutated breast cancer genes found by sequencing and differential expression. The stable breast cancer genome is enriched for cellular metabolism, regulation of gene expression, DNA packaging (chromatin and nucleosome assembly), and regulation of apoptosis functions. Stable genes participating in multiple essential pathways were consistently found to be targets of chemotherapies. Preservation of stable, essential genes may be related to the effectiveness of certain chemotherapeutic agents that act on multiple gene products in this set.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between alpha-folate receptor (\u03b1-FR) and the clinico-pathologic features and outcomes of serous ovarian carcinoma patients and the possible mechanism of \u03b1-FR to chemo-resistance. Therefore, semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reactions for \u03b1-FR expression were performed in the 91 specimens of serous ovarian carcinomas. The expression of \u03b1-FR in each ovarian cancer tissue specimen was defined as the ratio of density of \u03b1-FR to density of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). In\u00a0vitro apoptotic experiments were tested in the original OVCAR-3 tumor cells and various OVCAR-3 \u03b1-FR-transfectants. Patients with an increased \u03b1-FR expression level had poorer responses to chemotherapy (per \u03b1-FR expression level increase: odds ratio (OR): 8.97 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.40\u201357.36), p\u00a0=\u00a00.021). An increased \u03b1-FR expression level was an independently poor prognostic factor for disease free interval (DFI) (per \u03b1-FR expression level increase: hazard ratio (HR): 2.45 (95% CI: 1.16\u20135.18), p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and had a negative impact on overall survival (OS) of these serous ovarian cancer patients (per \u03b1-FR expression level increase: HR: 3.6 (95% CI: 0.93\u201313.29), p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) by multivariate analyses. \u03b1-FR inhibited cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis in our in\u00a0vitro apoptotic assays. \u03b1-FR could induce chemo-resistance via regulating the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, Bcl-2 and Bax. Therefore, \u03b1-FR can be a potential biomarker for the prediction of chemotherapeutic responses and clinical prognosis. It also could be the target of ovarian cancer treatment.",

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of PF-03084014, a \u03b3-secretase inhibitor, in combination with irinotecan to identify the effects of treatment on tumor recurrence and the tumor-initiating population in our CRC preclinical explant model. The combination of PF-03084014 and irinotecan had the greatest effect at reducing tumor growth on four CRC tumors when compared with treatment with PF-03084014 or irinotecan alone. The combination significantly reduced tumor recurrence in two CRC explants (CRC001 and CRC036) after treatment was discontinued. Both of these tumors exhibited elevated baseline levels of Notch pathway activation as well as an increase in NOTCH1 gene copy number when compared with the two CRC explants (CRC026 and CRC027) where tumors reappeared quickly after termination of treatment. Isolation and injection of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH+ and ALDH\u2212) cells in an in\u00a0vivo explant model demonstrated that the ALDH+ cell population were tumorigenic. Evaluation of the ALDH+ cells after 28 days of treatment showed that the combination reduced the ALDH+ population in the tumors that did not regrow. Furthermore, ALDH+ cells from CRC001 and CRC027 were injected in\u00a0vivo and treated immediately for 28 days. Two months after treatment, tumors were evident in the combination treatment group for CRC027 but not for CRC036. These results indicate the combination of PF-03084014 and irinotecan may be effective in reducing tumor recurrence in CRC patients whose tumors exhibit elevated levels of the Notch pathway.",

Conceptualizations such as the hallmarks of cancer are providing an organizing principle with which to distill and rationalize the abject complexities of cancer phenotypes and genotypes across the spectrum of the human disease. A countervailing reality, however, involves the variable and often transitory responses to most mechanism-based targeted therapies, returning full circle to the complexity, arguing that the unique biology and genetics of a patient's tumor will in the future necessarily need to be incorporated into the decisions about optimal treatment strategies, the frontier of personalized cancer medicine. This perspective highlights considerations, metrics, and methods that may prove instrumental in charting the landscape of evaluating individual tumors so to better inform diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. Integral to the consideration is remarkable heterogeneity and variability, evidently embedded in cancer cells, but likely also in the cell types composing the supportive and interactive stroma of the tumor microenvironment (e.g., leukocytes and fibroblasts), whose diversity in form, regulation, function, and abundance may prove to rival that of the cancer cells themselves.

This project led to elucidation of a reference normal human genome sequence and normal polymorphisms therein against which sequences from diseased tissues can be compared to enable identification of causal abnormalities. It also stimulated development of an array of computational tools for genomic analysis and catalyzed public and private sector development of revolutionary tools for genome analysis that transformed analysis of whole genomes from an enterprise that required international teams and hundreds of millions of dollars to a process that can be carried out in core facilities for only a few thousand dollars per sample. Indeed, the $1000 genome is nearly upon us. Applications of these technologies to human cancers in international cancer genome projects are now revealing the spectra of abnormalities that comprise thousands of individual cancers.

Most notably, we have moved from a one-size-fits-all approach that emphasized cytotoxic chemotherapy to a personalised medicine strategy that focuses on the discovery and development of molecularly targeted drugs that exploit the particular genetic addictions, dependencies and vulnerabilities of cancer cells. These exploitable characteristics are increasingly being revealed by our expanding understanding of the abnormal biology and genetics of cancer cells, accelerated by cancer genome sequencing and other high-throughput genome-wide campaigns, including functional screens using RNA interference. In this review we provide an overview of contemporary approaches to the discovery of small molecule cancer drugs, highlighting successes, current challenges and future opportunities. We focus in particular on four key steps: Target validation and selection; chemical hit and lead generation; lead optimization to identify a clinical drug candidate; and finally hypothesis-driven, biomarker-led clinical trials. Although all of these steps are critical, we view target validation and selection and the conduct of biology-directed clinical trials as especially important areas upon which to focus to speed progress from gene to drug and to reduce the unacceptably high attrition rate during clinical development. Other challenges include expanding the envelope of druggability for less tractable targets, understanding and overcoming drug resistance, and designing intelligent and effective drug combinations. We discuss not only scientific and technical challenges, but also the assessment and mitigation of risks as well as organizational, cultural and funding problems for cancer drug discovery and development, together with solutions to overcome the \u2018Valley of Death\u2019 between basic research and approved medicines. We envisage a future in which addressing these challenges will enhance our rapid progress towards truly personalised medicine for cancer patients.",

However, the molecular definition of cancer-associated antigens introduced the possibility of specific vaccines and adoptive T cell approaches aiming to target the tumor cells more specifically. The recent introduction of total exome sequencing has enabled the identification of patient tumor-specific epitopes generated through somatic point mutations, raising the possibility of targeting tumor antigens in individual patients which are even more tumor-specific. Transcriptional profiling and immunohistochemistry analyses have revealed a subset of patients with a pre-existing T cell-inflamed tumor microenvironment. This phenotype may be predictive of clinical outcome to immunotherapies and offers the possibility of a predictive biomarker. Further analysis of these tumors has identified a set of defined immune suppressive factors which themselves are being targeted with new immunotherapeutics, already with interesting early phase clinical trial results.

Analysis of tumor conditioned medium of U87MG, 4910 and HMECs transfected with shRNA against uPA or uPAR alone or in combination (pU2) revealed inhibition of GM-CSF-enhanced secretion of SVEGFR1 as shown by Western blotting and ELISA. Moreover, phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5, the downstream effectors of GM-CSF signaling, was also inhibited in all three cell lines. Phosphorylation at Tyr 166 position of the GM-CSFR\u03b2 subunit, the signal activating subunit of the GM-CSF receptor, was inhibited in HMEC, U87MG and 4910 cells. Further analysis revealed that shRNA against uPA and/or uPAR increased secretion of TIMP-1, which is known to enhance SVEGFR1 secretion in endothelial cells. Moreover, addition of purified uPA (with and without GM-CSF) activated JAK2/STAT5 signaling in HMEC. Exogenous addition of SVEGFR1 to pU2 tumor conditioned medium enhanced inhibition of VEGF-induced endothelial capillary tube formation as assessed by an in\u00a0vitro angiogenesis assay. To determine the significance of these events in\u00a0vivo, nude mice with pre-established tumors treated with shRNA against uPA and/or uPAR showed decreased levels of GM-CSF and increased levels of SVEGFR1 and TIMP-1 when compared with controls. Enhanced secretion of SVEGFR1 by puPA, puPAR and pU2 in endothelial and GBM cells was mediated indirectly by MMP-7 and augmented by ectodomain shedding of VEGFr1 by tyrosine phosphorylation at the 1213 position. Taken together, these results suggest that the uPA/uPAR system could prove beneficial as an indirect target for inhibition of angiogenesis in glioblastoma.",

     "abstract": "Medulloblastoma cells exhibit varied responses to therapy by all-trans retinoic acid (RA). The underlying mechanism for such diverse effects however remains largely unclear. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the molecular basis of RA resistance through the study of RA signaling components in both RA-sensitive (Med-3) and RA-resistant (UW228-2 and UW228-3) medulloblastoma cells. The results revealed that RAR\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 and RXR\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3 were found in the three cell lines. Expression of CRABP-I and CRABP-II was seen in Med-3 cells, up-regulated when treated with RA, but was absent in UW228-2 and UW228-3 cells regardless of RA treatment. Bisulfite sequencing revealed 8 methylated CG sites at the promoter region of CRABP-II in UW228-2 and UW228-3 but not in Med-3 cells. Demethylation by 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine recovered CRABP-II expression. Upon restoration of CRABP-II expression, both UW228-2 and UW228-3 cells responded to RA treatment by forming neuronal-like differentiation, synaptophysin expression, \u03b2-III tubulin upregulation, and apoptosis. Furthermore, CRABP-II specific siRNA reduced RA sensitivity in Med-3 cells. Tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical staining showed variable CRABP-II expression patterns among 104 medulloblastoma cases, ranging from negative (42.3%), partly positive (14.4%) to positive (43.3%). CRABP-II expression was positively correlated with synaptophysin (rs\u00a0=\u00a00.317; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) but not with CRABP-I expression (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In conclusion, aberrant methylation in CRABP-II reduces the expression of CRABP-II that in turn confers RA resistance in medulloblastoma cells. Determination of CRABP-II expression or methylation status may enable a personalized RA therapy in patients with medulloblastomas and other types of cancers.",

However, no effective strategies against VEGF expression have been available in NSCLCs therapy. This study demonstrated that elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels derived from both mitochondria and NADPH oxidase were required for VEGF expression in NSCLC cells. Atorvastatin administration could significantly inhibit VEGF expression both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo via inhibition of ROS production. Atorvastatin inhibited ROS generation partly through suppression of Rac1/NADPH oxidase activity. Specifically, atorvastatin could upregulate the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase, which are responsible for elimination of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively. Thus, inhibition of ROS production by concomitant suppression of Rac1/NADPH oxidase activity and upregulation of the activity of GPx and catalase contributes critically to atorvastatin-reduced VEGF expression in NSCLCs. Atorvastatin may be a potential alternative against VEGF expression and angiogenesis in NSCLCs therapy.",

The expression of MTUS1 gene leads to 5 known transcript variants and codes for 5 isoforms of Angiotensin II AT2 receptor interacting protein (ATIP). In this study, we first confirmed that the down-regulation of MTUS1/ATIP was a frequent event in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) and the premalignant lesion (leukoplakia). We further demonstrated that the down-regulation of MTUS1/ATIP was correlated with poor differentiation and enhanced proliferation (Ki67 proliferation index). Statistical analysis suggests that the down-regulation of MTUS1/ATIP was associated with reduced overall survival. Isoform specific quantitative RT-PCR assays revealed that ATIP1, ATIP3a and ATIP3b were the major isoforms of the MTUS1 gene products in oral tongue epithelial cells. Significant down-regulations were observed for all 3 ATIP isoforms in OTSCC as compared to matching normal tissues. In\u00a0vitro functional study showed that the restoration of ATIP1 expression led to G1 arrest, apoptosis and reduction of cell proliferation in OTSCC cell lines. These ATIP1-induced cellular changes were accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and up-regulation of p53. Taken together, these data suggest that MTUS1 plays major roles in the progression of OTSCC, and may serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target for patients with OTSCC.",

Data from a clinical trial randomizing patients to anthracyclines was used to assess whether the number of CEN-17 in breast cancers may predict incremental responsiveness to anthracyclines besides what is obtained when used relatively to TOP2A and HER2. As cut sections of paraffin-embedded tissue are prone to truncation of nuclei, strict definition of ploidy levels is lacking. We therefore used normal breast tissue to assist define ploidy levels in cut sections. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with centromere 17 (CEN-17) and TOP2A was performed on 120 normal breast specimens. The diploid CEN-17 copy number was reduced from the expected two signals in whole nuclei to an average of 1.68 signals per nucleus in cut sections of normal breast. Ploidy levels determined in normal breast were applied to data on 767 patients with known HER2 and TOP2A status randomized to anthracyclines in the DBCG 89D trial. CEN-17 ploidy levels were in cut sections from the 767 breast cancer patients established as: Haploid: \u22641.25 (10%), diploid: 1.26\u20132.09 (60%), triploid: 2.10\u20132.93 (21%), tetraploid: 2.94\u20133.77 (5%) or higher ploidy: \u22653.78 (4%). Amplification of HER2 and deletion of TOP2A were frequently observed in tumors with a high ploidy level.

     "abstract": "Cancer represents a complex group of heterogeneous diseases. While many cancers share fundamental biological processes (hallmarks of cancer) necessary for their development and progression, cancers also distinguish themselves by their dependence on distinct oncogenic pathways. Over the last decade, targeted therapies have been introduced to the clinic with variable success. In truth, single targeted therapies may be successful in only a subset of malignancies but insufficient to address malignancies that often rely on multiple pathways, thus evading single targeted agents. Investigators have recently identified potentially functional components of the human genome that were previously thought to have no biological function. This discovery has added to the already established complexity of gene regulation in the pathogenesis of cancer. Non-coding RNAs represent key regulators of gene expression. Improved knowledge of their biogenesis and function may in turn lead to a better understanding of the heterogeneity of malignancies and eventually be leveraged as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) for example, have the capacity for the regulation of multiple genes and thus redirection or reprogramming of biological pathways. However, several other members of the non-coding RNA family may be of equal biological relevance. In this review, we provide a perspective on emerging concepts in the clinical application of miRNA and other non-coding RNAs as biomarkers in cancer with an eye on the eventual integration of both miRNA and other non-coding RNA biology into our understanding of cancer pathogenesis and treatment.",

Several biological barriers preclude adequate delivery of drugs to tumors, and remain a formidable challenge to overcome in chemotherapy.

Knowledge about the gene expression patterns in existing breast cancer tumors may be used to identify risk factors in the breast tissue of women still free of cancer. The differential effects of estradiol, estradiol together with gestagens, or tibolone on breast cancer-related gene expression in normal breast tissue samples taken from postmenopausal women may be used to identify gene expression profiles associated with a higher breast cancer risk. Breast tissue samples were taken from 33 healthy postmenopausal women both before and after a six month treatment with either 2\u00a0mg micronized estradiol [E2], 2\u00a0mg micronized estradiol and 1\u00a0mg norethisterone acetate [E2\u00a0+\u00a0NETA], 2.5\u00a0mg tibolone [T] or [no HRT]. Except for [E2], which was only given to women after hysterectomy, the allocation to each of the three groups was randomized. The expression of 102 mRNAs and 46 microRNAs putatively involved in breast cancer was prospectively determined in the biopsies of 6 women receiving [no HRT], 5 women receiving [E2], 5 women receiving [E2\u00a0+\u00a0NETA], and 6 receiving [T]. Using epithelial and endothelial markers genes, non-representative biopsies from 11 women were eliminated. Treatment of postmenopausal women with [E2\u00a0+\u00a0NETA] resulted in the highest number of differentially (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) regulated genes (16.2%) compared to baseline, followed by [E2] (10.1%) and [T] (4.7%). Among genes that were significantly down-regulated by [E2\u00a0+\u00a0NETA] ranked estrogen-receptor-1 (ESR1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) and androgen receptor (AR, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019), whereas CYP1B1, a gene encoding an estrogen-metabolizing enzyme, was significantly up-regulated (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). Mammary cells triggered by [E2\u00a0+\u00a0NETA] and [E2] adjust for steroidogenic up-regulation through down-regulation of the estrogen-receptor pathway.

Our data suggest that normal mammary cells triggered by [E2\u00a0+\u00a0NETA] adjust for steroidogenic up-regulation through down-regulation of the estrogen-receptor pathway.

However, the direct effects of these pharmacologic agents on the endothelial cells of the vasculature have not been examined. Using primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), we characterized the effects of two FAK inhibitors, PF-573,228 and FAK Inhibitor 14 on essential processes for angiogenesis, such as migration, proliferation, viability and endothelial cell tube formation. We observed that treatment with either FAK Inhibitor 14 or PF-573,228 resulted in reduced HUVEC viability, migration and tube formation in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Furthermore, we found that PF-573,228 had the added ability to induce apoptosis of endothelial cells within 36\u00a0h post-drug administration even in the continued presence of VEGF stimulation. FAK inhibitors also resulted in modification of the actin cytoskeleton within HUVEC, with observed increased stress fiber formation in the presence of drug. Given that endothelial cells were sensitive to FAK inhibitors at concentrations well below those reported to inhibit tumor cell migration, we confirmed their ability to inhibit endothelial-derived FAK autophosphorylation and FAK-mediated phosphorylation of recombinant paxillin at these doses. Taken together, our data indicate that small molecule inhibitors of FAK are potent anti-angiogenic agents and suggest their utility in combinatorial therapeutic approaches targeting tumor angiogenesis.",

Gallbladder cancer is characterized by rapid progress, poor prognosis, and aberrantly high expression of Survivin. In the present study, we used a human tumor-specific Survivin promoter-regulated oncolytic adenovirus vector carrying P53 gene, whose anti-cancer effect has been widely confirmed, to construct a wide spectrum, specific, safe, effective gene-viral therapy system, AdSurp-P53. Examining expression of enhanced green fluorecent protein (EGFP), E1A and the target gene P53 in the oncolytic adenovirus system validated that Survivin promoter-regulated oncolytic adenovirus had high proliferation activity and high P53 expression in Survivin-positive gallbladder cancer cells. Our in\u00a0vitro cytotoxicity experiment demonstrated that AdSurp-P53 possessed a stronger cytotoxic effect against gallbladder cancer cells and hepatic cancer cells. The survival rate of EH-GB1 cells was lower than 40% after infection of AdSurp-P53 at multiplicity of infection (MOI)\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0pfu/cell, while the rate was higher than 90% after infection of Ad-P53 at the same MOI, demonstrating that AdSurp-P53 has a potent cytotoxicity against EH-GB1 cells. The tumor growth was greatly inhibited in nude mice bearing EH-GB1 xenografts when the total dose of AdSurp-P53 was 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109\u00a0pfu, and terminal dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) revealed that the apoptotic rate of cancer cells was (33.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4)%. This oncolytic adenovirus system overcomes the long-standing shortcomings of gene therapy: poor transgene expression and targeting of only specific tumors, with its therapeutic effect better than the traditional Ad-P53 therapy regimen already on market; our system might be used for patients with advanced gallbladder cancer and other cancers, who are not sensitive to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or who lost their chance for surgical treatment.",

In the 19 AML patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia, 31.6% of all characterized MLL fusion genes were MLL/MLLT3, 21.1% MLL/ELL, 10.5% MLL/MLLT6 and 10.5% MLL/EPS15. Two patients had rare or undescribed fusion genes, MLL/KIAA0284 and MLL/FLNA. Seven patients (26%) had a complex chromosomal rearrangement (three-way translocations, insertions, deletions) involving the MLL gene. Splicing fusion genes were found in three patients, leading to a MLL/EPS15 fusion in two and a MLL/ELL fusion in a third patient. This study showed that fusion involving the MLL gene can be generated through various chromosomal rearrangements such as translocations, insertions and deletions, some being complex or cryptic. A systematic approach should be used in all cases of acute leukemia starting with FISH analyses using a commercially available MLL split signal probe. Then, the analysis has to be completed, if necessary, by further molecular cytogenetic and genomic PCR methods.",

To evaluate the effect of ischemia time, tumor tissue from ten breast cancer patients was collected and aliquots of tissue were snap frozen at different time points after surgery (0, 0.5, 1, 3 and 6\u00a0h). Using miRNA and mRNA expression microarrays and statistical analysis, 56 miRNAs and 1788 mRNAs were found to be significantly altered with ischemia time up to six hours. Several of the 56 miRNAs have been reported to play a role in cancer, such as hsa-miR-663 and hsa-miR-125a-3p. Known stress response genes such as GADD45B, JUND and FOSB were among the mRNAs most significantly affected by time to freezing. A novel statistical method for identification of consistently correlated miRNA\u2013mRNA pairs and miRNA-associated biological processes in time course data is presented. Application of this method revealed that several miRNAs, including hsa-miR-1228, hsa-miR-1225-5p and hsa-miR-574-5p, were associated through their correlation to mRNAs to biological processes such as \u201cresponse to stimulus\u201d and \u201cstress response\u201d. These miRNAs also showed enrichment of predicted targets among either their positively or negatively correlated mRNAs. The induced miRNAs may play both direct and indirect roles in biological responses.

     "abstract": "Although mitochondrial respiration is decreased in most cancer cells, the role of this decrease in carcinogenesis and cancer progression is still unclear. To better understand this phenomenon, instead of further inhibiting mitochondrial function, we induced mitochondrial biogenesis in transformed cells by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) pathways. This was achieved by treating the cells with bezafibrate, a PPARs panagonist that also enhances PGC-1\u03b1 expression. We confirmed that bezafibrate treatment led to increased mitochondrial proteins and enzyme functions. We found that cells with increased mitochondrial biogenesis had decreased growth rates in glucose-containing medium. In addition, they became less invasive, which was directly linked to the reduced lactate levels. Surprisingly, even though bezafibrate-treated cells had higher levels of mitochondrial markers, total respiration was not significantly altered. However, respiratory coupling, and ATP levels were. Our data show that by increasing the efficiency of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, cancer progression is hampered by decreases in cell proliferation and invasiveness.",

ABCB6 expression was determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. ABCB6 expression was upregulated in all the HCC specimens and the three-hepatoma cell lines. Increased ABCB6 expression correlated with liver disease progression with the pattern of expression being HCC\u00a0>\u00a0cirrhosis\u00a0>\u00a0steatosis. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ABCB6 in Huh7 cells lead to decreased cellular proliferation and colony formation. Attenuation of ABCB6 expression did not affect Huh7 apoptosis but lead to a delay in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, ABCB6 overexpression resulted in increased growth and proliferation of Huh7 cells. Since ABCB6 expression is induced in multiple tumor types we explored the role of ABCB6 in other cancer cells. ShRNA mediated knockdown of ABCB6 in HEK293 and K562 cells reduced cellular proliferation leading to a delay in G2/M phase, while ABCB6 overexpression promoted cell growth and proliferation. Collectively, these findings, obtained by loss of function and gain of function analysis, suggest that ABCB6 plays a role in cell growth and proliferation by targeting the cell cycle.",

     "abstract": "Cathepsin B and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) are overexpressed in gliomas. Deregulation of the G1 phase cell cycle machinery is a common feature of cancers. p27Kip1 (p27) is one of the major cyclin-CDK regulators in the G1 phase. uPAR and cathepsin B downregulation was recently shown to induce p27 expression through PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a signaling. Since uPAR and cathepsin B knockdown also decreased phosphorylation of ERK, we hypothesized that ERK also has a role to play in p27 induction. As induction of p27 is due to an increase in gene transcription, we investigated the roles of c-Myc and E2F1 transcription factors which have been shown to potently affect p27 promoter activity. In the present study, shRNA against cathepsin B and uPAR as well as specific inhibitors, Wortmannin (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and U0126 (10\u00a0\u03bcM), were used to determine the roles of AKT and ERK signaling on p27 expression. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that downregulation of both p-ERK and p-AKT downstream of EGFR and \u03b21 integrin are involved in the p27 upregulation. Cathepsin B and uPAR downregulation induced E2F1 and decreased phosphorylaion of pocket proteins and c-Myc expression. CHIP analysis and luciferase expression studies confirmed the functional association of transcription factor E2F1 to the p27 promoter. Further, c-Myc\u2013Max interaction inhibitor studies showed an inverse pattern of c-Myc and p27 expression. Also, cathepsin B and uPAR downregulation reduced tumor growth and increased p27 nuclear expression in\u00a0vivo. In summary, cathepsin B and uPAR downregulation reduced p-ERK levels and c-Myc expression, increased expression of E2F1 and FOXO3a, decreased phosphorylation of pocket proteins and thus upregulated p27 expression in glioma cells.",

Among the genes identified, one of particular interest w\u0430s DOK1, or downstream of tyrosine kinase 1, previously recognized as a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG) for leukemia and other human malignancies. Using bisulfite sequencing, we determined that a 5\u2032-non-coding DNA region (located at nt \u22121158 to \u2212850, upstream of the DOK1 translation start codon) was extensively hypermethylated in primary serous EOC tumors compared with normal ovarian specimens; however, this hypermethylation was not associated with DOK1 suppression. On the contrary, DOK1 was found to be strongly overexpressed in serous EOC tumors as compared to normal tissue and importantly, DOK1 overexpression significantly correlated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) values of serous EOC patients. Ectopic modulation of DOK1 expression in EOC cells and consecutive functional analyses pointed toward association of DOK1 expression with increased EOC cell migration and proliferation, and better sensitivity to cisplatin treatment. Gene expression profiling and consecutive network and pathway analyses were also confirmative for DOK1 association with EOC cell migration and proliferation. These analyses were also indicative for DOK1 protective role in EOC tumorigenesis, linked to DOK1-mediated induction of some tumor suppressor factors and its suppression of pro-metastasis genes. Taken together, our findings are suggestive for a possible tumor suppressor role of DOK1 in EOC; however its implication in enhanced EOC cell migration and proliferation restrain us to conclude that DOK1 represents a true TSG in EOC. Further studies are needed to more completely elucidate the functional implications of DOK1 and other members of the DOK gene family in ovarian tumorigenesis.",

Among these genes, LOH11CR2A showed highest frequency of deletion (56%), followed by PIG8 (35%), CHEK1 (31%) and ROBO3/ROBO4/HEPACAM loci (28%). Comparable frequency of promoter methylation (26\u201335%) was observed for LOH11CR2A, CHEK1 and PIG8. Overall alterations (deletion/methylation) of these genes were in the following order: LOH11CR2A (60%)\u00a0>\u00a0PIG8 (46%)\u00a0>\u00a0CHEK1 (41%) and showed significant association with each other. Breast carcinoma samples that were estrogen/progesterone receptor negative showed significantly high deletion and overall alterations than estrogen/progesterone receptor positive samples for LOH11CR2A, CHEK1 and PIG8. The methylation and overall alteration of LOH11CR2A were significantly associated with tumor stages in breast carcinoma. However, in early/late onset and estrogen/progesterone receptor positive/negative breast carcinoma, the overall alterations of LOH11CR2A, PIG8 and CHEK1 were differentially associated with advanced stages, tumor grade and lymph node metastasis. Alterations of PIG8 and CHEK1 were significantly associated with poor prognosis in patients with early age of onset of the disease indicating significant prognostic importance. Quantitative mRNA expression analysis detected reduced expression of the genes in the order LOH11CR2A\u00a0>\u00a0CHEK1\u00a0>\u00a0PIG8. Immunohistochemical analysis showed reduced protein expression of PIG8 and CHEK1 that was concordant with their molecular alterations.

We demonstrate that restoration of Pin1 in cell lines found to be deficient\u00a0in Pin1 protein expression can attenuate the growth of ccRCC cells in soft agar and a xenograft tumor model. Moreover, this ability of Pin1 to negatively influence tumor growth in ccRCC cells may be dependent on the presence of functional p53, which is infrequently mutated in ccRCC.

We evaluated the DNA copy number and mRNA expression of JS-2 in 176 colorectal tissues (116 adenocarcinomas, 30 adenomas and 30 non-neoplastic tissues) using real-time polymerase chain reaction. JS-2 expression was also evaluated in two colorectal cancer cell lines and a benign colorectal cell line. JS-2 amplification was noted in 35% of the colorectal adenocarcinomas. Significant differences in relative expression levels for JS-2 mRNA between different colorectal tissues were noted (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Distal colorectal adenocarcinoma had significantly higher copy number than proximal adenocarcinoma (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). The relative expression level of JS-2 was different between colonic and rectal adenocarcinoma (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Mucinous adenocarcinoma showed higher JS-2 expression than non-mucinous adenocarcinoma (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Early T-stage cancers appear to have higher JS-2 copy number and lower expression of JS-2 mRNA than later stage cancers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and 0.03 respectively). Colorectal cancer cell lines showed lower expression of JS-2 than the benign colorectal cell line. JS-2 copy number change and expression were shown for the first time to be altered in the carcinogenesis of colorectal cancer.

The DNA damage response (DDR), most robustly mobilized by double-strand breaks (DSBs), rapidly activates an extensive signaling network that affects numerous cellular systems, leading to cell survival or programmed cell death. A major component of the DDR is the widespread modulation of gene expression. We analyzed together six datasets that probed transcriptional responses to ionizing radiation (IR) \u2013 our novel experimental data and 5 published datasets \u2013 to elucidate the scope of this response and identify its gene targets. According to the mRNA expression profiles we recorded from 5 cancerous and non-cancerous human cell lines after exposure to 5\u00a0Gy of IR, most of the responses were cell line-specific. Computational analysis identified significant enrichment for p53 target genes and cell cycle-related pathways among groups of up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. Computational promoter analysis of the six datasets disclosed that a statistically significant number of the induced genes contained p53 binding site signatures. p53-mediated regulation had previously been documented for subsets of these gene groups, making our lists a source of novel potential p53 targets. Real-time qPCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays validated the IR-induced p53-dependent induction and p53 binding to the respective promoters of 11 selected genes.

     "abstract": "Trying to kill cancer cells by generating DNA damage is by no means a new idea. Radiotherapy and genotoxic drugs are routinely used in cancer therapy. More recent developments also explored the potential of targeting the DNA damage response (DDR) in order to increase the toxicity of radio- and chemo- therapy. Chk1 inhibitors have pioneered studies in this regard. Interestingly, early studies noted that Chk1 inhibitors were particularly toxic for p53-deficient cells. The model proposed for this observation was that this effect was due to the simultaneous abrogation of the G2 (Chk1) and G1 (p53) checkpoints. We here challenge this view, and propose a model where the toxicity of Chk1 inhibitors is rather due to the fact that these compounds generate high loads of replicative stress (RS) during S-phase, which are further boosted by the less restrictive S-phase entry found in p53-deficient cells. This new model implies that the particular toxicity of Chk1 inhibitors might not be restricted to p53-deficient cells, but could be extended to other mutations that promote a promiscuous S-phase entry. In addition, this rationale also implies that the same effect should also be observed for other molecules that target the RS-response (RSR), such as inhibitors of the Chk1-activating kinase ATR.",

The critical role of the microenvironment, along with glioma stem cells, is supported directly or indirectly by the following observations: glioma stem cells have been shown to reside preferentially in specific niches, the characteristics of which are known to influence cellular responses to radiation; radiation modifies environmental factors; and, contrarily to the consistency of clinical data, in vitro experiments have reported a wide variety in the radiation response of these cells.The paper, therefore, focuses on the interaction between tumour stem cells and the microenvironment, analyzing how its various elements (endothelial cells, extracellular matrix, cytokines, nitric oxide, oxygen levels) are affected by radiation and how these might influence the response of tumour stem cells to radiation.Finally, we summarize the ongoing debate on the optimal culture conditions for glioma stem cells and the difficulties in designing assays that reliably characterize their radiation response.",

There are a number of recent reports challenging this model. Here, alternative models that are not mutually exclusive are presented to explain the synthetic lethality between BRCA1/2 and PARP inhibitors. One such model proposes that PARP inhibition causes PARP-1 to be trapped onto DNA repair intermediates, especially during base excision repair. This may in turn cause obstruction to replication forks, which require BRCA-dependent homologous recombination to be resolved. In another model, PARP is directly involved in catalysing replication repair in a distinct pathway from homologous recombination.

     "abstract": "Immunotherapy-based strategies for gastrointestinal carcinomas (GIC) have been exploited so far, but these approaches have to face strong mechanisms of immune escape induced by tumours. We previously demonstrated that sub-therapeutic doses of an adenovirus expressing IL-12 genes (AdIL-12) mediated a potent antitumour effect against subcutaneous (s.c.) colorectal carcinomas (CRC) in mice pre-treated with low doses of cyclophosphamide (Cy). In our study we used this combination to assess its impact on the immunosuppressive microenvironment. In s.c. CRC model we demonstrated that non-responder mice failed to decrease Tregs in tumour, spleen and peripheral blood. Reconstitution of Tregs into tumour-bearing mice treated with combined therapy abolished the antitumoural effect. In addition, Cy\u00a0+\u00a0AdIL-12 modified Tregs functionality by inhibiting the in vitro secretion of IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2 and their ability to inhibit dendritic cells activation. Combined treatment decreased the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in comparison to non-treated mice and, interestingly, administration of Tregs restored splenic MDSCs population. Furthermore, combined therapy potently generated specific cytotoxic IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD4+ T cells able to eradicate established CRC tumours after adoptive transfer. Finally, we evaluated the combination on disseminated CRC and pancreatic carcinoma (PC). Cy\u00a0+\u00a0AdIL-12 were able to eradicate liver metastatic CRC (47%) and PC tumour nodules (40%) and to prolong animal survival. The results of this study support the hypothesis that Cy\u00a0+\u00a0AdIL-12 might be a valid immunotherapeutic strategy for advanced GIC.",

     "abstract": "Protein Inhibitor of Activated Signal Transducer and Activators of Transcription 3 (PIAS3) is an endogenous inhibitor of STAT3 transcriptional activity. We have previously demonstrated the concentration-dependent negative regulatory effect of PIAS3 on STAT3 signaling and its capacity to decrease lung cancer proliferation and synergize with epidermal growth factor inhibition. We now investigate PIAS3 expression in both non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and human resected NSCLC specimens. We also investigated the mechanism by which some lung cancers have significantly decreased PIAS3 expression. Expression of PIAS3 is variable in lung cancer cells lines with 2 of 3 squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines having no or little PIAS3 protein expression. Similarly, the majority of human SCCs of the lung lack PIAS3 expression by immunohistochemistry; this despite the finding that SCCs have significantly higher levels of PIAS3 mRNA compared to adenocarcinomas. High PIAS3 expression generally correlates with decreased phosphorylated STAT3 in both SCC cell lines and human specimens compatible with the negative regulatory effect of this protein on STAT3 signaling. To investigate this variable expression of PIAS3 we first performed sequencing of the PIAS3 gene that demonstrated single nucleotide polymorphisms but no mutations. Exposure of lung cancer cells to 5-azacytidine and trichostatin A results in a significant increase in PIAS3 mRNA and protein expression. However, methylation-specific PCR demonstrates a lack of CpG island methylation in the promoter region of PIAS3. Exposure of cells to an agent blocking proteosomal degradation results in a significant increase in PIAS3. Our data thus shows that SCC of the lung commonly lacks PIAS3 protein expression and that post-translational modifications may explain this finding in some cases. PIAS3 is a potential therapeutic molecule to target STAT3 pathway in lung cancer.",

     "publication date": "06-2011",
     "abstract": "Differentiation-inducing therapy has been proposed to be a novel potential approach to treat malignant gliomas. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a well-known specific astrocyte biomarker and acts as a tumor suppressor gene (TSG) in glioma pathogenesis. Previously we reported that a traditional biotoxin cholera toxin could induce malignant glioma cell differentiation characterized by morphologic changes and dramatic GFAP expression. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying GFAP induction are still largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that an oncogenic pathway interleukin-6/janus kinase-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (IL-6/JAK2/STAT3) cascade mediates the cholera toxin-induced GFAP expression. Cholera toxin dramatically stimulated GFAP expression at the transcriptional level in C6 glioma cells. Meanwhile, phosphorylation of STAT3 and JAK2 was highly induced in a time-dependent manner after cholera toxin incubation, whereas no changes of STAT3 and JAK2 were observed. Furthermore, the IL-6 gene was quickly induced by cholera toxin and subsequent IL-6 protein secretion was stimulated. Importantly, exogenous recombinant rat IL-6 can also induce phosphorylation of STAT3 concomitant with GFAP expression while JAK2 specific inhibitor AG490 could effectively block both cholera toxin- and IL-6-induced GFAP expression. Given that the methylation of the STAT3 binding element can suppress GFAP expression, we detected the methylation status of the critical recognition sequence of STAT3 in the promoter of GFAP gene (\u22121518\u00a0\u223c\u00a0\u22121510) and found that it was unmethylated in C6 glioma cells. In addition, neither DNA methyltransferase1 (DNMT1) inhibitor 5-Aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-AZa-CdR) nor silencing DNMT1 can stimulate GFAP expression, indicating that the loss of GFAP expression in C6 cells is not caused by its promoter hypermethylation. Taken together, our findings suggest that activation of a pro-survival IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 cascade contributes to cholera toxin-induced GFAP expression, which implies that a survival-promoting signal may also play a differentiation-supporting role in malignant gliomas.",

The majority of the differentially expressed miRNAs (30/49) were up-regulated in tumor stage MF. The most significant differentially expressed were miR-155 and miR-92a (both up-regulated in tumor stage MF), while miR-93 showed the highest up-regulation in tumor stage MF with a fold difference of 5.8. Differential expression of a selection of these miRNAs was validated by miRNA-Q-PCR on additional test groups (tumors and controls). None of the miRNAs up-regulated in tumor stage MF was previously shown to be up-regulated in Sz, and only 2 of the 19 miRNAs down-regulated in tumor stage MF were also down-regulated in Sz.

     "abstract": "In the initial period after melanoma was recognised as a disease entity in the early 1800\u2019s, it was subclassified on the basis of its presumed origin (from a precursor naevus, from a melanocytic precursor lesion acquired during adult life or in previously blemish-fee skin). In 1967 the eminent American pathologist, Dr Wallace Clark, proposed a histogenetic classification for melanoma in which the disease was subdivided predominantly on the basis of histopathological features of the intra-epidermal component of the tumour adjacent to any dermal invasive component. The subtypes were superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) and nodular melanoma (NM). Whilst additional entities, including acral lentiginous melanoma, mucosal melanoma, desmoplastic melanoma and naevoid melanoma have since been recognised, SSM, LMM and NM remain in the latest (2006) version of the WHO melanoma classification. Clark\u2019s histogenetic classification has been criticised because the criteria upon which it is based include clinical features (such as the site of the melanoma) and non-tumourous histopathological features (such as the character of the associated epidermis and the degree of solar elastosis) and also because of overlap in defining features, lack of an independent association with patient outcome and minimal relevance as a determinant of clinical management. However, such criticisms fail to acknowledge its importance in highlighting the myriad of clinical and histological guises of melanoma, which if not recognized by clinicians and pathologists will inevitably lead to a delay in diagnosis and a concomitant adverse clinical outcome. Recently, mutually exclusive oncogenic mutations in melanomas involving NRAS (15\u201320%), BRAF (50%), CKIT (2%), and GNAQ/GNA11 (50% of uveal melanomas) have been identified. This might herald the beginning of a new molecular classification of melanoma in which the biologically distinct subsets share a common oncogenic mechanism, behave clinically in a similar fashion and require similar clinical management. These discoveries are already being successfully exploited as therapeutic targets in clinical trials of metastatic melanoma patients with promising activity. Whilst there remains much to be discovered in this rapidly evolving field, there is already great optimism that more rational and effective therapies for melanoma patients will soon be widely available.",

Driven by this practical clinical interest, a more detailed characterization of CTA biology has been recently undertaken. So far, at least 70 families of CTA, globally accounting for about 140 members, have been identified. Most of these CTA are expressed during spermatogenesis, but their function is still largely unknown. Epigenetic events, particularly DNA methylation, appear to be the primary mechanism regulating CTA expression in both normal and transformed cells, as well as in cancer stem cells.

     "abstract": "Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone, which is essential to health and for which epidemiological studies suggest a role in autoimmune disease, infections, cardiovascular disease and cancer. It is ingested in foods such as oily fish and supplements, so that average levels vary between countries, but most individuals worldwide make most of their vitamin D as a result of the effects of sun exposure on the skin. Many studies in different populations around the world have in recent years shown that sub-optimal levels of vitamin D (<70\u00a0nmol/L) are common. A series of epidemiological studies have suggested that low vitamin D levels increase the risk of cancers, particularly of the breast and gastrointestinal tracts, so that there has been much interest in understanding the effects of vitamin D on cancer cells. Vitamin D binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) resulting in transcription of a number of genes playing a role in inhibition of MAPK signalling, induction of apoptosis and cell-cycle inhibition, and therefore vitamin D has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in cells of many lineages. It also has suppressive effects on adaptive immunity and is reported to promote innate immunity. Here we review data on vitamin D and melanoma. There are in vitro data, which suggest that vitamin D has the same anti-proliferative effects on melanoma cells as have been demonstrated in other cells. We have reported data to suggest that vitamin D levels at diagnosis have a role in determining outcome for melanoma patients. There is a curious relationship between melanoma risk and sun exposure where sunburn is causal but occupational sun exposure is not (at least in temperate climes). Seeking to understand this, we discuss data, which suggest (but by no means prove) that vitamin D might also have a role in susceptibility to melanoma. In conclusion, much remains unknown about vitamin D in general and certainly about vitamin D and melanoma. However, the effects of avoidance of suboptimal vitamin D levels on cancer cell proliferation are likely to be beneficial to the melanoma patient. The possible results of high vitamin D levels on the immune system remain unclear however and a source of some concern, but the data support the view that serum levels in the range 70\u2013100\u00a0nmol/L might be a reasonable target for melanoma patients as much as for other members of the population.",

Importantly, the loss of p18 is necessary and sufficient for RET2A-mediated hyperproliferation. The loss of N-Myc in mice results in embryonic lethality due to a lack of neuronal progenitor cells that fail to proliferate, correlate with accumulation of p18 and p27. Therefore, N-Myc may regulate expression of both CDKIs. Also, N-Myc is expressed predominantly in neuroendocrine cells that give rise to the primary cell types affected in MEN2A. Together these studies suggest that N-Myc is a downstream target of RET2A signaling that prevents accumulation of p18 and/or p27. We report that MAPK activation by RET2A leads to a transient induction of N-Myc mRNA and protein levels, and that N-Myc induction is required to maintain low p18 and p27 levels. Induced N-Myc levels correlate with increased binding of N-Myc to an initiator consensus binding site in the p18 promoter, and this binding is essential\u00a0for RET2A-mediated transcriptional regulation of p18. Finally, loss of N-Myc induction\u00a0prevents RET2A-mediated hyperproliferation. Our results demonstrate for the first time that N-Myc is a downstream target of RET2A signaling, and propose that induction of N-Myc by RET2A is a key step leading to lower p18 levels during MEN2A tumorigenesis.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, our knowledge on estrogen receptors (ER) has been modified profoundly with the identification and the deciphering of the role of its protein effectors, as well as\u00a0with the deeper insight of its molecular structure/function dynamics, characteristics associated with its nucleo-cytoplasmic-membrane shuttling properties. Also, significant progress has been made concerning its turn-over and associated final proteasomal degradation processes. These advances could lead in the near future to the design and the synthesis of novel receptor-interacting drugs. Recently, a number of receptor-related peptides acting as specific ER ligands have been identified and extensively studied with respect to their estrogenic/antiestrogenic activities. Among them, ER\u03b117p, a synthetic analog of the P295-T311 sequence of ER\u03b1, has been shown to exert pseudo-estrogenic effects by interacting in the close vicinity of its hinge region (BF3 domain). Remarkably, this sequence appears as the epicenter of a number of post-transcriptional modifications as well as of the recruitment of co-regulators, suggesting that it would play a key role in ER\u03b1 functions. Here, we provide evidence that ER\u03b117p induces apoptosis in ER\u03b1-positive (MCF-7, T47D) and -negative (MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3) breast cancer cells by an ER\u03b1-independent membrane mechanism, triggering major pro-apoptotic signaling cascades. Finally, ER\u03b117p induces the regression of breast ER\u03b1-negative cancer tumor xenografts, without apparent toxicity, suggesting that it could represent a new attractive tool for the development of future promising therapeutic approaches, and providing a novel insight to ER regulation of cell fate.",

We previously demonstrated that\u00a0the KLK locus (19q13.3/4) is subject to copy-number gains and structural rearrangements in a pilot study of cell lines and ovarian cancer primary tissues, shown to overexpress KLK gene family members. To determine the overall frequency of genomic instability and copy-number changes, a retrospective study was conducted using formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues. Eighty-one chemotherapy na\u00efve serous OCas were examined using 3-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization\u00a0(FISH) to identify structural and numerical changes on 19q, including the KLK locus;\u00a0in addition to immunohistochemistry (IHC) for KLK6, which has been shown to be overexpressed in OCa.

All cases showed a wide range of immuoreactivity for KLK6 by IHC. Although no strong correlation could be found with copy-number, the latter was contributing factor to the observed KLK6 protein overexpression. Moreover, univariate and multivariate analyses showed an association between the net loss of the KLK locus and longer disease-free survival. Interestingly, FISH\u00a0analyses indicated that chromosome 19q was subjected to structural rearrangement in 62% of cases and was significantly correlated to tumor grade (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be divided in subtypes based on histology, gene expression profiles as well as differences in genomic aberrations. Distinct global DNA methylation profiles have been reported in normal breast epithelial cells as well as in breast tumors. However, the influence of the tumor methylome on the previously described subgroups of breast cancer is not fully understood. Here we report the DNA methylation profiles of 80 breast tumors using a panel of 807 cancer related genes interrogating 1505 CpG sites. We identified three major clusters based on the methylation profiles; one consisting of mainly tumors of myoepithelial origin and two other clusters with tumors of predominantly luminal epithelial origin. The clusters were different with respect to estrogen receptor status, TP53 status, ErbB2 status and grade. The most significantly differentially methylated genes including HDAC1, TFF1, OGG1, BMP3, FZD9 and HOXA11 were confirmed by pyrosequencing. Gene Ontology analysis revealed enrichment for genes involved in developmental processes including homeobox domain genes (HOXA9, HOXA11, PAX6, MYBL2, ISL1 and IPF1) and (ETS1, HDAC1, CREBBP, GAS7, SPI1 and TBX1). Extensive correlation to mRNA expression was observed. Pathway analyses identified a significant association with canonical (curated) pathways such as hepatic fibrosis including genes like EGF, NGFR and TNF, dendritic cell maturation and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Our results show that breast tumor expression subtypes harbor major epigenetic differences and tumors with similar gene expression profiles might belong to epigenetically different subtypes. Some of the transcription factors identified, with key roles in differentiation and development might play a role in inducing and maintaining the different phenotypes.",

Gene expression studies have identified five major subtypes\u2013 Luminal A, Luminal B, basal-like, ErbB2+ and Normal-Like. We set out to determine the role of DNA methylation in subtypes by performing genome-wide scans of CpG methylation in breast cancer samples with known expression-based subtypes. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using a set of most varying loci clustered the tumors into a Luminal A majority (82%) cluster, Basal-like/ErbB2+ majority (86%) cluster and a non-specific cluster with samples that were also inconclusive in their expression-based subtype correlations. Contributing methylation loci were both gene associated loci (30%) and non-gene associated (70%), suggesting subtype dependant genome-wide alterations in the methylation landscape. The methylation patterns of significant differentially methylated genes in luminal A tumors are similar to those identified in CD24\u00a0+\u00a0luminal epithelial cells and the patterns in basal-like tumors similar to CD44\u00a0+\u00a0breast progenitor cells. CpG islands in the HOXA cluster and other homeobox (IRX2, DLX2, NKX2-2) genes were significantly more methylated in Luminal A tumors. A significant number of genes (2853, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) exhibited expression\u2013methylation correlation, implying possible functional effects of methylation on gene expression. Furthermore, analysis of these tumors by using follow-up survival data identified differential methylation of islands proximal to genes involved in Cell Cycle and Proliferation (Ki-67, UBE2C, KIF2C, HDAC4), angiogenesis (VEGF, BTG1, KLF5), cell fate commitment (SPRY1, OLIG2, LHX2 and LHX5) as having prognostic value independent of subtypes and other clinical factors.",

     "abstract": "Background: Although imatinib mesylate has revolutionized the management of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), resistance and progression almost inevitably develop with long-term monotherapy. To enhance imatinib-induced cytotoxicity and overcome imatinib-resistance in GIST cells, we examined the antitumor effects of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor ABT-737, alone and in combination with imatinib.Methods: We treated imatinib-sensitive, GIST-T1 and GIST882, and imatinib-resistant cells with ABT-737 alone and with imatinib. We determined the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects by cell viability assay, flow cytometric apoptosis and cell cycle analysis, immunoblotting, and nuclear morphology. Synergism was determined by isobologram analysis.Results: The IC50 of single-agent ABT-737 at 72\u00a0h was 10\u00a0\u03bcM in imatinib-sensitive GIST-T1 and GIST882 cells, and 1\u00a0\u03bcM in imatinib-resistant GIST48IM cells. ABT-737 and imatinib combined synergistically in a time- and dose-dependent manner to inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of all GIST cells, as evidenced by cell viability and apoptosis assays, caspase activation, PARP cleavage, and morphologic changes. Isobologram analyses revealed strongly synergistic drug interactions, with combination indices <0.5 for most ABT-737/imatinib combinations. Thus, clinically relevant in vitro concentrations of ABT-737 have single-agent antitumor activity and are synergistic in combination with imatinib.Conclusion: We provide the first preclinical evidence that Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition with ABT-737 synergistically enhances imatinib-induced cytotoxicity via apoptosis, and that direct engagement of apoptotic cell death may be an effective approach to circumvent imatinib-resistance in GIST.",

We examined the composition of the Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC) at various mitotic phases and after chemical treatments using is-PLA with antibodies against the core CPC subunits Aurora B, INCENP, Survivin and Borealin. Our results support the notion that the core CPC functions as a single structural unit at centromeres in early mitosis and at central spindle after the onset of anaphase. Treatment of cells with the Aurora B inhibitor ZM447439 diminished the is-PLA signals at centromeres suggesting that Aurora B activity contributes to structural maintenance and/or proper subcellular localization of the core CPC. Is-PLA-based analysis of interaction between INCENP and Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) proposes that the kinase co-travels with CPC during late mitosis. The data illustrates both the strengths and limitations of the is-PLA in the analysis of mitotic macromolecule associations at sub-organelle level.",

     "abstract": "Our limited understanding of the biological impact of the whole spectrum of early breast lesions together with a lack of accurate molecular-based risk criteria for the diagnosis and assignment of prognostic significance to biopsy findings presents an important problem in the clinical management of patients harboring precancerous breast lesions. As a result, there is a need to identify biomarkers that can better determine the outcome of early breast lesions by identifying subpopulations of cells in breast premalignant disease that are at high-risk of progression to invasive disease. A first step towards achieving this goal will be to define the molecular phenotypes of the various cell types and precursors \u2013 generated by the stem cell hierarchy \u2013 that are present in normal and benign conditions of the breast. To date there have been very few systematic proteomic studies aimed at characterizing the phenotypes of the different cell subpopulations present in normal human mammary tissue, partly due to the formidable heterogeneity of mammary tissue, but also due to limitations of the current proteomic technologies. Work in our laboratories has attempted to address in a systematic fashion some of these limitations and here we present our efforts to search for biomarkers using normal fresh tissue from non-neoplastic breast samples. From the data generated by the 2D gel-based proteomic profiling we were able to compile a protein database of normal human breast epithelial tissue that was used to support the biomarker discovery program. We review and present new data on the putative cell-progenitor marker cytokeratin 15 (CK15), and describe a novel marker, dihydropyriminidase-related protein 3 (DRP3) that in combination with CK15 and other well known proteins were used to define molecular phenotypes of normal human breast epithelial cells and their progenitors in resting acini, lactating alveoli, and large collecting ducts of the nipple. Preliminary results are also presented concerning DRP3 positive usual ductal hyperplasias (UDHs) and on single cell layer columnar cells (CCCs). At least two bona fide biomarkers of undifferentiated ER\u03b1/PgR negative luminal cells emerged from these studies, CK15 and c-KIT, which in combination with transformation markers may lead to the establishment of a protein signature able to identify breast precancerous at risk of progressing to invasive disease.",

     "abstract": "Cancer in the 21st century has become the number one cause of death in developed countries. Although much progress has been made in improving patient survival, tumour relapse is one of the important causes of cancer treatment failure. An early observation in the study of cancer was the heterogeneity of tumours. Traditionally, this was explained by a combination of genomic instability of tumours and micro environmental factors leading to diverse phenotypical characteristics. It was assumed that cells in a tumour have an equal capacity to propagate the cancer. This model is currently known as the stochastic model. Recently, the Cancer stem cell model has been proposed to explain the heterogeneity of a tumour and its progression. According to this model, the heterogeneity of tumours is the result of aberrant differentiation of tumour cells into the cells of the tissue the tumour originated from. Tumours were suggested to contain stem cell-like cells, the cancer stem cells or tumour-initiating cells, which are uniquely capable of propagating a tumour much like normal stem cells fuel proliferation and differentiation in normal tissue.In this review we discuss the normal stem cell biology of the stomach and intestine followed by both the stochastic and cancer stem cell models in light of recent findings in the gastric and intestinal systems. The molecular pathways underlying normal and tumourigenic growth have been well studied, and recently the stem cells of the stomach and intestine have been identified. Furthermore, intestinal stem cells were identified as the cells-of-origin of colon cancer upon loss of the tumour suppressor APC. Lastly, several studies have proposed the positive identification of a cancer stem cell of human colon cancer.At the end we compare the cancer stem cell model and the stochastic model. We conclude that clonal evolution of tumour cells resulting from genetic mutations underlies tumour initiation and progression in both cancer models. This implies that at any point during tumour development any tumour cell can revert to a cancer stem cell after having gained a clonal advantage over the original cancer stem cell. Therefore, these models represent two sides of the same coin.",

We will review the recent literature with respect to these critical issues to provide a direct link between primitive cells and prostate cancer.",

The discovery of rare cells with stem cell-like properties in solid tumours is emerging as an important area of cancer research and may help explain the resistance of these tumours to current therapeutics. Despite rapid developments in cancer stem cell research in other solid tumours, progress in the lung has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the epithelial stem cell hierarchy, the heterogeneity of disease and the lack of a suitable in vivo transplantation model to assess stem cell behaviour. In this review we critically discuss what is currently known about the role of normal stem cells and cancer-initiating cells in lung tumour development, and briefly discuss strategies aimed at advancing the field of lung stem cell biology, with an emphasis on the design and manipulation of state-of-art mouse models.",

Although, the CSC hypothesis does not directly address the cell of origin of cancer, it is postulated that tissue-resident stem or progenitor cells are the most common targets of transformation. Clinically, CSCs are predicted to mediate tumor recurrence after chemo- and radiation-therapy due to the relative inability of these modalities to effectively target CSCs. If this is the case, then CSC must be efficiently targeted to achieve a true cure. Similarities between normal and malignant stem cells, at the levels of cell-surface proteins, molecular pathways, cell cycle quiescence, and microRNA signaling present challenges in developing CSC-specific therapeutics. Approaches to targeting CSCs include the development of agents targeting known stem cell regulatory pathways as well as unbiased high-throughput siRNA or small molecule screening. Based on studies of pathways present in normal stem cells, recent work has identified potential \u201cAchilles heals\u201d of CSC, whereas unbiased screening provides opportunities to identify new pathways utilized by CSC as well as develop potential therapeutic agents.

     "abstract": "Brain tumors, which are typically very heterogeneous at the cellular level, appear to have a stem cell foundation. Recently, investigations from multiple groups have found that human as well as experimental mouse brain tumors contain subpopulations of cells that functionally behave as tumor stem cells, driving tumor growth and generating tumor cell progeny that form the tumor bulk, but which then lose tumorigenic ability. In human glioblastomas, these tumor stem cells express neural precursor markers and are capable of differentiating into tumor cells that express more mature neural lineage markers. In addition, modeling brain tumors in mice suggests that neural precursor cells more readily give rise to full blown tumors, narrowing potential cells of origin to those rarer brain cells that have a proliferative potential. Applying stem cell concepts and methodologies is giving fresh insight into brain tumor biology, cell of origin and mechanisms of growth, and is offering new opportunities for development of more effective treatments. The field of brain tumor stem cells remains very young and there is much to be learned before these new insights are translated into new patient treatments.",

     "abstract": "Solid tumours are the most common cancers and represent a major therapeutic challenge. The cancer stem cell hypothesis is an attractive model to explain the functional heterogeneity commonly observed in solid tumours. It proposes a hierarchical organization of tumours, in which a subpopulation of stem cell-like cells sustains tumour growth, metastasis, and resistance to therapy. We will present the most recent advances in the cancer stem cell field, with particular emphasis on pancreatic cancer as one of the deadliest human tumours, and highlight open questions and caveats to be addressed in future studies. There is increasing evidence that solid tumours including pancreatic cancer are hierarchically organized and sustained by a distinct subpopulation of cancer stem cells. However, direct evidence for the validity of the cancer stem cell hypothesis in human pancreatic cancer remains controversial due to the limitations of xenograft models but supportive data are now emerging from mouse models using related or different sets of markers for the identification of murine cancer stem cells. Therefore, while the clinical relevance of cancer stem cells remains a fundamental issue for this rapidly emerging field, current findings clearly suggest that specific elimination of these cells is possible and therapeutically relevant. Targeting of signalling pathways that are of particular importance for the maintenance and the elimination of cancer stem cell as the proposed root of the tumour may lead to the development of novel treatment regimens for pancreatic cancer. Here we will review the current literature on pancreatic cancer stem cells and the future perspective of this rapidly emerging field.",

Recent studies have revealed cytokines such as Interferon-alpha (IFN\u03b1) and G-CSF as well as arsenic trioxide (As2O3) to be efficient agents for promoting cycling of dormant HSCs and LSCs. Most interestingly, such cell cycle activated stem cells become exquisitely sensitive to killing by different chemotherapeutic agents, suggesting that dormant LSCs in patients may be targeted by a sequential two-step protocol involving an initial activation by IFN\u03b1, G-CSF or As2O3, followed by targeted chemotherapy.",

The consideration of models of cancer progression is therefore important to understand the essence of this disease. Previous work has suggested that melanoma may propagate according to a cancer stem cell (CSC) model in which rare tumorigenic and bulk non-tumorigenic cells are organized into stable hierarchies within tumors. However, recent studies using assays that are more permissive for revealing tumorigenic potential indicate that it will not be possible to cure patients by focusing research and therapy on rare populations of cells within melanoma tumors. Studies of the nature of tumorigenic melanoma cells reveal that these cells may gain a growth, metastasis and/or therapy resistance advantage by acquiring new genetic mutations and by reversible epigenetic mechanisms.

Gene amplification and overexpression of ACK1 were found in many cancer types such as those of the lung and prostate. Previously, we identified both somatic- and germ line missense mutations in the ACK1 coding sequence, by surveying 261 cancer cell lines and 15 control tissues. Here, we verified and characterized the non-synonymous mutation, ACK-S985 N, located in the ubiquitin association domain of the protein.Both overexpression and silencing experiments in MCF7 and A498 cells, respectively, demonstrated a role of the ACK1 S985 N mutation in enhancing cell proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth as well as the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. Further, we showed that the ACK1 S985 N mutant is unable to bind ubiquitin, unlike the wild type kinase. This contributed to ACK1 protein stability and stabilized EGFR after EGF stimulation, thereby prolonging mitogenic signaling in cancer cells. In addition, the ACK1 S985 N-EGFR interaction is enhanced, but not the ubiquitination of the receptor. Intriguingly, silencing of ACK1 in A498 cells sensitized the renal carcinoma cells to gefitinib, against which they are otherwise resistant.The work demonstrates that other than gene amplification, a single somatic mutation in ACK1 can result in extended protein stability enabling the oncoprotein to exert its oncogenic function in tumor progression. It also provides a rationale to target ACK1 in combination with other chemotherapeutic drugs, such as EGFR inhibitors, to potentiate therapeutic action against resistant tumors.",

Recently, KIT D816V was reported to be expressed in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, it was not clarified whether these patients have co-existing occult SM. We investigated neoplastic cells in 101 patients with AML for expression of KIT D816V. In 7/101 patients (6.9%), KIT D816V was detectable. After a thorough histologic, molecular, and biochemical analysis, all 7 cases were found to have an associated SM, leading to the final diagnosis SM-AML. Microdissected tryptase+ MC displayed KIT D816V in all patients tested, whereas CD34+ blasts exhibited KIT D816V in only 2/4 patients. In one AML patient, SM without KIT D816V was detected. In all other patients, no associated SM was found, and leukemic blasts were negative for KIT D816V. In summary, our data show that KIT D816V in AML is highly associated with co-existing SM (SM-AML).

To monitor COX-2 expression non-invasively during tumor development, we created a Cox-2 luciferase knock-in mouse, Cox-2luc, in which the firefly luciferase coding region replaces the Cox-2 coding region. Luciferase activity was non-invasively, quantitatively and repeatedly monitored in Cox-2luc/+ mice subjected to DMBA/TPA multistage skin tumor induction. Luciferase activity is significantly higher in all papillomas than in surrounding skin. However, the magnitude of Cox-2 promoter-driven luciferase activity in small papillomas cannot predict subsequent papilloma regression or growth. Elevated Cox-2 promoter-driven luciferase signal can be detected when papillomas first become visible, but not before this time.",

Some DCIS lesions are believed to rapidly transit to invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs), while others remain unchanged. Existing classification systems for DCIS fail to identify those lesions that transit to IDC. We studied gene expression patterns of 31 pure DCIS, 36 pure invasive cancers and 42 cases of mixed diagnosis (invasive cancer with an in situ component) using Agilent Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarrays 44k. Six normal breast tissue samples were also included as controls. qRT-PCR was used for validation. All DCIS and invasive samples could be classified into the \u201cintrinsic\u201d molecular subtypes defined for invasive breast cancer. Hierarchical clustering establishes that samples group by intrinsic subtype, and not by diagnosis. We observed heterogeneity in the transcriptomes among DCIS of high histological grade and identified a distinct subgroup containing seven of the 31 DCIS samples with gene expression characteristics more similar to advanced tumours. A set of genes independent of grade, ER-status and HER2-status was identified by logistic regression that univariately classified a sample as belonging to this distinct DCIS subgroup. qRT-PCR of single markers clearly separated this DCIS subgroup from the other DCIS, and contains samples from several histopathological and intrinsic molecular subtypes. The genes that differentiate between these two types of DCIS suggest several processes related to the re-organisation of the microenvironment. This raises interesting possibilities for identification of DCIS lesions both with and without invasive characteristics, which potentially could be used in clinical assessment of a woman\u2019s risk of progression, and lead to improved management that would avoid the current over- and under-treatment of patients.",

Microarray-based technologies have unravelled the molecular underpinning of several characteristics of breast cancer, including metastatic propensity and histological grade, and have led to the identification of prognostic and predictive gene expression signatures. Furthermore, a molecular taxonomy of breast cancer based on transcriptomic analysis has been proposed. However, microarray studies have primarily focused on invasive ductal carcinomas of no special type. Owing to the relative rarity of special types of breast cancer, information about the biology and clinical behaviour of breast cancers conveyed by histological type has not been taken into account. Histological special types of breast cancer account for up to 25% of all invasive breast cancers. Recent studies have provided direct evidence of the existence of genotypic\u2013phenotypic correlations. For instance, secretory carcinomas of the breast consistently harbour the t(12;15) translocation that leads to the formation of the ETV6\u2013NTRK3 fusion gene, adenoid cystic carcinomas consistently display the t(6;9) MYB\u2013NFIB translocation and lobular carcinomas consistently show inactivation of the CDH1 gene through multiple molecular mechanisms.

The three patterns are associated with distinct gene-expression subtypes, and preferentially target different loci in the genome (implicating distinct cancer genes). Moreover, the different patterns of alteration imply distinct underlying mechanisms of genomic instability. The amplifier pattern may arise from transient telomere dysfunction, although new data suggest ongoing \u201camplifier\u201d instability. The complex pattern shows similarity to breast cancers with germline BRCA1 mutation, which also exhibit \u201cbasal-like\u201d expression profiles and complex-pattern genomes, implicating a possible defect in BRCA1-associated repair of DNA double-strand breaks.

     "abstract": "Defining the pathways through which tumors progress is critical to our understanding and treatment of cancer. We do not routinely sample patients at multiple time points during the progression of their disease, and thus our research is limited to inferring progression a posteriori from the examination of a single tumor sample. Despite this limitation, inferring progression is possible because the tumor genome contains a natural history of the mutations that occur during the formation of the tumor mass. There are two approaches to reconstructing a lineage of progression: (1) inter-tumor comparisons, and (2) intra-tumor comparisons. The inter-tumor approach consists of taking single samples from large collections of tumors and comparing the complexity of the genomes to identify early and late mutations. The intra-tumor approach involves taking multiple samples from individual heterogeneous tumors to compare divergent clones and reconstruct a phylogenetic lineage. Here we discuss how these approaches can be used to interpret the current models for tumor progression. We also compare data from primary and metastatic copy number profiles to shed light on the final steps of breast cancer progression. Finally, we discuss how recent technical advances in single cell genomics will herald a new era in understanding the fundamental basis of tumor heterogeneity and progression.",

Simultaneous analysis of the expression of all glycan-related genes clearly gives the advantage of enabling a comprehensive view of the genetic background of the glycobiological changes in cancer cells. Studies focusing on the expression of the whole glycome have now become possible, which prompted us to review the present knowledge on glycosylation in relation to breast cancer diagnosis and progression, in the light of available expression data from tumors and breast tissue of healthy individuals. We used various data resources to select a set of 419 functionally relevant genes involved in synthesis, degradation and binding of N-linked and O-linked glycans, Lewis antigens, glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin, heparin and keratan sulfate in addition to hyaluronan) and glycosphingolipids. Such glycans are involved in a number of processes relevant to carcinogenesis, including regulation of growth factors/growth factor receptors, cell\u2013cell adhesion and motility as well as immune system modulation. Expression analysis of these glycan-related genes revealed that mRNA levels for many of them differ significantly between normal and malignant breast tissue. An associative analysis of these genes in the context of current knowledge of their function in protein glycosylation and connection(s) to cancer indicated that synthesis, degradation and adhesion mediated by glycans may be altered drastically in mammary carcinomas. Although further analysis is needed to assess how changes in mRNA levels of glycan genes influence a cell's glycome and the precise role that such altered glycan structures play in the pathogenesis of the disease, lessons drawn from this study may help in determining directions for future research in the rapidly-developing field of glycobiology.",

High-resolution microPET scanning and murine cancer models make it possible to analyze longitudinally glucose metabolism during the appearance, development and progression of individual experimental tumors. In this study, we used 18F-FDG microPET and micro computerized tomography (microCT) to investigate glucose uptake in the DMBA/TPA chemically-induced multistage mouse skin carcinogenesis model. 18F-FDG uptake is significantly higher in all papillomas than in surrounding skin. Elevated 18F-FDG uptake is observed when tumors can be identified morphologically, but not before. Although 18F-FDG uptake is high in all fully invasive, malignant skin squamous cell carcinomas, uptake in papillomas and microinvasive malignant squamous cell carcinomas is variable and does not exhibit any correlation with tumor stage.",

In addition, transplantation of E14.5 fetal liver (FL) Prep1i/i cells into lethally irradiated mice induces lymphomas. In agreement with the above data, haploinsufficiency of a different Prep1-deficient (null) allele accelerates E\u03bcMyc lymphoma growth. Therefore Prep1 has a tumor suppressor function in mice.Immunohistochemistry on tissue micrroarrays (TMA) generated from three distinct human cohorts comprising a total of some 1000 human tumors revealed that 70% of the tumors express no or extremely low levels of Prep1, unlike normal tissues.

     "abstract": "Membrane-initiated androgen actions have now been acknowledged, even though a specific binding site has not been biochemically characterized yet. Recent data indicate that testosterone\u2013BSA, a non-permeable testosterone analog, can exert specific actions in breast cancer cell lines, including proper transcriptional effects, independent of the intracellular androgen sites. In the present work we explore the effects of testosterone\u2013BSA in two specifically modified pathways, revealed by early trascriptome analysis, namely the non-genotropic androgen signaling and the HIF1\u03b1 pathway. We provide evidence that p38 MAPK and PI3K/Akt/NF\u03baB and/or Rho/Actin pathways are directly involved in testosterone-induced apoptosis, while the JNK/c-JUN pathway is involved in membrane site-initiated transcription. Furthermore we show that membrane-acting androgens modify the transcription of the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), leading to erythropoietin-initiated actions. Interestingly, association of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) together with testosterone\u2013BSA protects cells from apoptosis, through discrete signaling events. The effect of testosterone\u2013BSA is exerted through the classical erythropoietin promoter, while rHuEPO decreases the transcription of EPOR acting on a newly identified regulatory/promoter region, upstream of its known promoter. These results suggest a new interaction of membrane-acting androgen with EPOR and should be taken into account in the pharmaceutical manipulations of breast cancer patients.",

VEGF165 was constantly secreted by all cultured tumor cells in an mTOR-dependent manner, as it was inhibited by the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Secreted VEGF165 showed functional activity by inducing endothelial leakiness and tumor cell-transendothelial migration in vitro, effects which could be reverted by the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab.Thus, mTOR inhibitors as well as bevacizumab should be considered as potential agents in cancer patients suffering from malignant effusions.",

     "publication date": "04-2010",
     "abstract": "Copy number changes in TOP2A have frequently been linked to ERBB2 (HER2) amplified breast cancers. To study this relationship, copy number changes of ERBB2 and TOP2A were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in two cell lines; one characterized by having amplification of both genes and the other by having amplification of ERBB2 and deletion of TOP2A. The characteristics are compared to findings on paired ERBB2 and TOP2A data from 649 patients with invasive breast cancer from a previously published biomarker study. The physical localization of FISH signals in metaphase spreads from cell lines showed that simultaneous amplification is not a simple co-amplification of a whole amplicon containing both genes. Most gene signals are translocated to abnormal marker chromosomes. ERBB2 genes but not TOP2A genes are present in tandem amplicons, leading to a higher ERBB2 ratio. This observation was confirmed by patient FISH data: among 276 (43% of all patients) abnormal tumors, 67% had different ERBB2 and TOP2A status. ERBB2 amplification with normal TOP2A status was found in 36% of the abnormal tumors (15% of all patients). Simultaneous amplification of both genes was found in 28% of the abnormal tumors (12% of all patients) while TOP2A deletion and ERBB2 amplification was observed in 16% of the abnormal cases (8% of all patients). A small number of tumors had TOP2A amplification (4%) or deletion (6%) without simultaneous changes of the ERBB2 gene. ERBB2 deletion was also observed (5%) but only in tumors with simultaneous TOP2A deletion. The average gene/reference ratio was significantly different: 5.0 for TOP2A but 7.2 for ERBB2 in the amplified tumors (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Amplification of the two genes may be caused by different mechanisms, leading to higher level of amplification for ERBB2 compared to TOP2A. In the majority of breast cancer patients, simultaneous aberration of ERBB2 and TOP2A is not explained by simple co-amplification.",

     "abstract": "Cytotoxicity of the topoisomerase II (topoII) poison etoposide has been ascribed to the persistent covalent trapping of topoII in DNA cleavage complexes that become lethal as cells replicate their DNA. However, short term etoposide treatment also leads to subsequent cell death, suggesting that the lesions that lead to cytotoxicity arise rapidly and prior to the onset DNA replication. In the present study 1\u00a0h treatment with 25\u00a0\u03bcM etoposide was highly toxic and initiated a double-stranded DNA damage response as reflected by the recruitment of ATM, MDC1 and DNA-PKcs to \u03b3H2AX foci. While most DNA breaks were rapidly repaired upon withdrawal of the etoposide treatment, the repair machinery remained engaged in foci for at least 24\u00a0h following withdrawal. TopoII siRNA ablation showed the etoposide toxicity and \u03b3H2AX response to correlate with the inability of the cell to correct topoII\u03b1-initiated DNA damage. \u03b3H2AX induction was resistant to the inhibition of DNA replication and transcription, but was increased by pre-treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A. These results link the lethality of etoposide to the generation of persistent topoII\u03b1-dependent DNA defects within topologically open chromatin domains.",

A factorial experimental design allowed us to determine the effect of RCT on tumour tissue alone by removing the effect of radiation on normal tissue. This resulted in 1327 differentially expressed genes in tumour tissue with p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is by far the most common diagnosed form of cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women today. Clinically useful biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer could lead to a significant reduction in mortality. Here we describe a detailed analysis using gel-based proteomics in combination with mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the tumour interstitial fluids (TIF) and normal interstitial fluids (NIF) collected from 69 prospective breast cancer patients. The goal of this study was to identify abundant cancer up-regulated proteins that are externalised by cells in the tumour microenvironment of most if not all these lesions. To this end, we applied a phased biomarker discovery research strategy to the analysis of these samples rather than comparing all samples among each other, with inherent inter and intra-sample variability problems. To this end, we chose to use samples derived from a single tumour/benign tissue pair (patient 46, triple negative tumour), for which we had well-matched samples in terms of epithelial cell numbers, to generate the initial dataset. In this first phase we found 110 proteins that were up-regulated by a factor of 2 or more in the TIF, some of which were confirmed by IHC. In the second phase, we carried out a systematic computer assisted analysis of the 2D gels of the remaining 68 TIF samples in order to identify TIF 46 up-regulated proteins that were deregulated in 90% or more of all the available TIFs, thus representing common breast cancer markers. This second phase singled out a set of 26 breast cancer markers, most of which were also identified by a complementary analysis using LC-MS/MS. The expression of calreticulin, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II, chloride intracellular channel protein 1, EF-1-beta, galectin 1, peroxiredoxin-2, platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor, protein disulfide isomerase and ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 5 were further validated using a tissue microarray containing 70 malignant breast carcinomas of various grades of atypia. A significant number of these proteins have already been detected in the blood/plasma/secretome by others. The next steps, which include biomarker prioritization based on the hierarchal evaluation of these markers, antibody and antigen development, assay development, analytical validation, and preliminary testing in the blood of healthy and breast cancer patients, are discussed.",
