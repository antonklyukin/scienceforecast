     "abstract": "The aim of this study is to analyze the demographic, histopathologic features of Neuroendocrine tumor (NET) cases and to underline the treatment approaches over seven years period in a high-volume cancer center.This study designed as a retrospective evaluation of NET registry data from a single medical oncology clinic between January 2012 and November 2017.A total of 72 patients'? data were registered. The median age was 54 (18\u201384) years. The three most common sites of diagnosis were pancreas (19 cases, 26.4%), unknown primary with liver metastasis (15 cases-20.8%) and lung (10\u201313.9%). There was no association between the extent of disease and grade of NET (p\u202f=\u202f0.73). Apart from pancreatic NETs, there was no difference in the stages of disease presentation (p\u202f>\u202f0.05). Globally, estimated 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was 77.5% and 10-year OS rate was 57.8%. There was no statistically significant difference in estimated 5- year OS rates of comparison between grade 1 and grade 2 NET's (69.9 vs. 91.8%, p\u202f=\u202f0.19). In addition, Ki67 proliferative index did not make any difference in estimated 5- year OS rates (78.1 vs 77.7%, p\u202f=\u202f0.71).The multimodality treatment, site specific approaches and radionuclide therapies lead to better response rates and a longer survival in patients. Although there is a difference in distribution and presentation of NET cases compared to previous publications, optimal treatment yields a good Results?. Wherever possible, treatment of NETs is optimally scheduled by a multidisciplinary team, data collection should be centralized and audited by the team to make a clear conclusion for a less acknowledged tumor type.",

Median number of doses (Nivo\u00a0+\u00a0ipi and nivo alone) were 4 with a median follow-up of 19 weeks. Thirty patients (75%) were alive and 24 patients (60%) were on treatment. TRAEs of any grade and grade 3\u20134 occurred in 53% and 20% of the patients, respectively. One patient died due to TRAEs (colitis and diarrhea) after the second dose of nivo\u00a0+\u00a0ipi. Median times to onset and resolution of TRAEs were 6 and 3 weeks, respectively. Eleven patients (28%) discontinued treatment for reasons other than TRAEs. TRAEs of any grade led to discontinuation in 5 patients (13%). Most of the TRAEs were reversible when managed with available guidelines.Safety profile of N\u00a0+\u00a0I was found to be consistent with early reports. Increased experience with the management of TRAEs of immunotherapies, short follow-up and \u22652 line real-world setting may account for lower TRAEs rates. Long-term follow is needed.",

In fact, up to some extent, the cytokine release may be an indicator of the antitumor effects of immune-based therapies. Therefore, the distinction between the level at which the efficiency of treatment is ensured and the point at which the life-threatening cytokine release syndrome starts is critically important. Recently, considerable developments have been achieved with regard to the prevention or control of this syndrome.

     "abstract": "Drug interactions are common in cancer patients as they use many drugs concurrently. Most drug interactions have been reported to be among supportive care medications. Antiemetics are one of the commonly used drugs in these patients for the management of disease and therapy related nausea and vomiting and they are sometimes used in combinations. The objective of this review is to determine and compare potential drug interactions among these drugs using Micromedex and Lexicomp drug interaction checkers. There is an increase in the risk of extrapyramidal activities and neuroleptic malign syndrome accompanying the concurrent use of olanzapine and metoclopramide and thus this combination should be avoided. Another important consequence of interactions is QT prolongation associated with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. Care must be taken especially in patients with risk factors. The NK1 receptor antagonist reduce the metabolism of dexamethasone and increase its exposure, therefore the dose of dexamethasone when used as an antiemetic should be reduced when used in combination with these agents. No dose adjustments are recommended when dexamethasone is used as an adjuvant in chemotherapy regimen, but patients should be monitored for side effects. It should not be forgotten that these interactions may also be present with other medications, all medications taken by cancer patients should be adequately reviewed to reduce drug interaction related problems in these patients.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common glial tumor. Angiogenesis which provides nutrient and oxygen support to proliferating cells play an essential role in GBM development, proliferation and metastasis. The development of antiangiogenetic agents is a promising treatment issue as blood vessels are essential for the vitality of tumor cells. AT-101 is -(\u2212) enantiomer of gossypol having anti-proliferative effects on different cancer cell lines. In this study, the cytotoxicity effect of AT-101 on GBM cell lines (U-87MG ve T98G) was confirmed and also the impact of this drug on VEGF synthesis on these cell lines were evaluated at transcriptional and protein levels.U-87\u202fMG and T98\u202fcell lines were treated with increasing concentrations (1\u201350\u202f\u03bcM) of AT-101 for 72\u202fh. Cytotoxicity was determined by xCELLigence (Roche). Apoptosis was detected by using ELISA and confirmed by caspase assay. VEGF and other proangiogenic factors expression were evaluated by angiogenesis array.The cell vitality was constantly followed up in the experiment. The cytotoxicity of AT-101 in both cell lines increased significantly at 24\u202fh. The IC-50 values of U-87\u202fMG and T98 were 2.4 and 2.7\u202f\u03bcM respectively. The VEGF mRNA levels decreased by 2.7 fold in U-87MG and 3 fold in T98G by treating these cell lines with AT-101 IC50 dose for 24\u202fh.This study showed that AT-101 suppress VEGF on protein levels at U-87\u202fMG and T98G cell lines and showed AT-101 might be a promising targeted agent in GBM treatment.",

     "abstract": "Even though ABO blood group surface antigens are expressed in red blood cells, they can be observed in many normal and pathologic cells. Relationship between ABO blood groups and progression and prognosis of cancer has been mainly demonstrated in gastric and pancreatic cancer. However there is no study in current literature about its relation with testicular cancer. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the prognostic value of the ABO blood group in nonseminomatous testicular cancer patients who treated with high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation.64 patients who diagnosed as non-seminomatous testicular cancer and treated with HDC and OSCT in Gulhane Medical Oncology Clinic between January 2011 and December 2016 were enrolled to the study. Patients' age, TNM stage, chemotherapy protocols and blood group characteristics were obtained retrospectively.The mean age of patients was 31.4 (18\u201361) years. Blood groups of patients' were as follows: A blood group 19 (29.7%), B blood group 7 (10.9%), O blood group 34 (53.1%), AB blood group 4 (6.3%). Rh was negative in 3 patients (4.7%) and Rh positive in 61 patients (95.3%). 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 72.5% and 2-year PFS was 68.4%. 1-year overall survival (OS) was 82% and 2-years OS was 72%. While 1-year and 2-year OS was 88.2% and 84.4% in O blood group individuals, respectively, it was 75.6% and 59.5% in all other blood types, respectively. Although the OS was superior in individuals with O blood group, the difference was not reached the statistically significance (p\u202f=\u202f0.071). When O blood group was compared with other blood groups in terms of PFS, 1 year PFS was 79.1% in O blood group and 65.2% in the all other blood groups (p\u202f=\u202f0.19).OS and PFS were superior in O blood group than other blood groups, however the difference was not reached statistical significance. In the literature, there is no study that focused on the relationship between stem cell transplantation and blood groups. ABO blood groups are the phenotype of a person's genotype and may reflect differences in the individual's immune mechanisms. However, due to small number of cases and heterogeneity of the group, the results and the strength of the study may have affected negatively. So, the prognostic importance of ABO blood groups can be shown with multi-center studies that performed with larger number of cases.",

The interviews were conducted at 4 separate national oncology, pediatrics, gynecology and family medicine congresses. With the questions, the participants' attitudes towards HPV vaccination as well as the power, timing, consistency and scope of their recommendations were questioned.In the study; 33% of the respondents stated that the vaccination was not important, and the ones who considered it to be unnecessary (31%) pointed out its non-cost effectiveness to justify their opinion. Only 51% of the respondents stated that the vaccine should be administered to both girls and boys. The rate of the respondents who stated that it should be administered to those with a risk factor was only 19%. 21% of the respondents stated that they promoted the vaccination in their routine practice. In addition, it was observed that the respondents, who answered correctly the question intended for questioning the their knowledge about HPV\u2019s share in all types of cancer, considered the vaccine to be more important and recommended it more in their routine practices.The results of the analyses reveal that the low HPV vaccination rates are caused substantially by the attitudes of physicians regarding the vaccination; that they do not adequately play a role in its promotion; and that it should be the basic strategy to increase the physicians\u2019 level of knowledge about the vaccine, for increasing the rate of vaccination.This is the first study in the literature, which involves the evaluation of the attitudes of physicians\u2014who are the primary interlocutors in the matter of HPV vaccination\u2014from 4 branches towards HPV vaccination. The study is also one of the first studies involving a sophisticated evaluation of the attitudes of physicians towards HPV vaccination.

It also estimated serum levels of SCCA1, p16 and Ki67 as potential non-invasive biomarkers of cervical abnormalities.This cross-sectional study included 203 consenting participants (NSWs\u202f=\u202f98 and CSWs\u202f=\u202f105) within the age-range of 20\u201349 years. Interview based risk factor questionnaire was administered, Pap smears were made from cervical scrapings and classified accordingly while serum levels of SCCA1, Ki67 and p16, EBV, HPV and HSV2 antibodies were determined by ELISA method. Multivariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were on generated data carried out and significance set at p\u202f<\u202f0.05.Among NSWs, higher prevalence of cervicitis, atypical squamous cell of undetermined significance (ASCUS), low grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and high grade squamous cell intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) were 18.4%, 16.3%, 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively while the prevalence of the cervical abnormalities were 7.6%, 7.6%, 8.6% and 3.8%, respectively among CSWs (p\u202f=\u202f0.04). Decreasing and increasing sero-prevalence of viral infections were observed from cervicitis, ASCUS, LSIL to HSIL among NSWs (77, 56, 54.5 and 50%) and CSWs (75, 87.5, 100 and 100%), respectively (p\u202f=\u202f0.08).

However, no evidence has yet to be found that proves the alleged connections and mechanisms of reflexology. Indeed, studies carried out up to date were focused on the symptomatic effects of reflexology, rather than such links and mechanisms. In some studies, certain positive results have been obtained especially in terms of pain and anxiety. However, these studies were methodologically incomplete, as well, due to challenges such as the difficulty in creating blinding and placebo effect. As a result, currently we have no reliable evidence about the use of reflexology in any clinical situation.

Based on many previous reports it is evident that the expression of various cellular genes are been regulated by Sp1 the transcription factor, but still a better understanding is required, about its role in developing and progressing the human cancer. Sp1 is been found playing dual role such as the activation as well as suppression of the cellular genes either converting into an oncogene or performing biological activity such as proliferation, differentiation, DNA damage response, apoptosis and angiogenesis. There are even proofs, which suggest that Sp1 has homologous forms of proteins named as Sp2 and Sp3, which also support Sp1 in contributing the progression of tumor cells. These typical characters of Sp1 and its interesting facts related to biological functions are yet to be explained clearly. Thus, in this current review, we briefly explain the role, characters and proteins associated with Sp1 family of transcription factor do contribute as a \u201challmarks of cancer\u201d.

As an indicator of antioxidant capacity thiol/disulfide homeostasis regulates detoxification, cell signal mechanisms, apoptosis, transcription and antioxidant defense mechanisms. Disregulation of thiol/disulfide homeostasis identified in other cancer types by recent data. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the thiol/disulfide homeostasis in advanced gastric cancer patients.The patients who diagnosed with gastric cancer and healthy control subjects were included to study. Serum samples for the thiol-disulphide test were obtained at the time of diagnosis. Thiol-disulphide homeostasis tests were measured by the automated spectrophotometric method. Thiol-disulphide homeostasis was also measured according to clinical and laboratory features.Thirty newly diagnosed advanced gastric adenocarcinoma patients and 28 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The native thiol (NT) and total thiol (TT) levels of patients' group were significantly lower compared with controls (p\u202f=\u202f0.001 and p\u202f<\u202f0.001). In the CEA high (\u22655.4\u202fng/ml) group, DS/NT ratio were higher compared with CEA low (<5.4\u202fng/ml) group (p\u202f=\u202f0.024). In CA.19-9 high (\u226528.3 kU/L) group, both DS and DS/NT ratio were significantly higher compared with a CA19-9 low(<28.3 kU/L) group (p\u202f<\u202f0.05 both). The correlation between CEA and DS levels was also significant (p\u202f=\u202f0.02). There was also a positive correlation between CEA levels and DS/NT ratio (p\u202f=\u202f0.01).Derangements of thiol/disulfide homeostasis may have a role in gastric cancer pathogenesis and the higher level of oxidative stress may relate to extensive and aggressiveness of the advanced disease. The diagnostic and prognostic values of thiol/disulfide products need to identify with further studies.",

The combination of HER2 targeted therapies with chemotherapatic agents prolongs overall survival. Pertuzumab is a new monoclonal antibody molecule that binds to the extracellular portion of HER2 and works by inhibiting homo- and heterodimerization. The aim of this study is to document the real life data of toxicities seen in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with first line trastuzumab-pertuzumab combination therapy.A retrospective review of 26 cases from the medical oncology patient registry was conducted to include the dates October 2016 through December 2017. The number of cycles of treatment and doses, adverse events, dose changes and course delays, reasons for treatment change and types of second line treatments are noted. The imaging and laboratory test results were obtained from the electronic registration system. The cumulative toxicity incidence was accepted as the primary endpoint.The median age of the 26 cases was 54 years. The median cycle number of pertuzumab and docetaxel treatments were 9 and 7, respectively and the median duration of pertuzumab therapy was 6.75 months. As of the date of last follow-up, 80.7% of the cases were still under treatment. There was a total of 6 cases of delay in treatment, of which five were due to neutropenia, while in one case the cause was diarrhea. When the adverse events were examined, at least one side effect (excluding alopecia) was observed in 16 patients and 7 cases had no toxicity except alopecia. In terms of constitutional symptoms, eight of the 19 patients had grade 1 fatique, one case had itching, and three patients had asthenia. Hematologic toxicity was seen in twelve cases and all had at least grade 1 leukopenia. Grade 3-4 febrile neutropenia occurred only in one case.

Although the combination of Brentuximab vedotin (BV) with AVD is suggested as an alternative treatment to combinations including bleomycin for patients with pulmonary involvement. The efficacy and adverse effects of BV have not been specialized on pulmonary HL. There is insufficient data about neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of cases treated with BV. We performed this retrospective study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of BV in patients with pulmonary HL and to demonstrate the prognostic role of NLR in patients treated with BV.Data of 10 CD 30 (+) HL patients who treated with BV between years 2011\u20132016 were analyzed retrospectively. Relapsed cases after autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) and/or resistant cases to at least two lines of chemotherapy, and treated with BV were included in the study.Patients underwent a median of 8.5 cycles BV. Eight patients (80%) achieved an objective response including 2 of them (20%) with complete response and six of them (60%) with a partial response at the end of the 3rd cycle. At a median follow-up of 16.8 months, median progression-free survival for all patients was 6 months and 3 patients died because of progression. BV, as a single agent, revealed well response in HL cases with pulmonary involvement and other clinical types. No pulmonary toxicity has been occurred due to BV. NLR was found to be o good indicator of prognosis and mortality in pulmonary HL patients and other HL patients. While NLR was not influenced by BV, it can be suggested as an easy prognostic marker in patients treated with BV.BV may be used as a bridge therapy to the next curative treatment in order to obtain minimal tumor burden in pulmonary HL patients, and NLR can be used as a prognostic marker in these patients.

Early-stage NSCLC, however, has relapse rate over 40% mostly at distant sites. Therefore, high relapse rate necessitates urgent novel biomarker for these patients. In this study, we aim to evaluate the predictive and prognostic role of FOXP3+ Treg cells along with well defined Clinicohistopathological factors in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). FOXP3 expression in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) was examined by immunohistochemical staining from resected early-stage 48 NSCLC patients. Data of patients and FOXP3 expression status along with common clinicohistopathological prognostic factors were evaluated retrospectively. Median age of patients was 62 years-old (range 43\u201378). Mean follow-up, median overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were 49, 49 and 30 months, respectively. FOXP3 expression was positive in 23 (47.9%) patients. Adjuvant chemotherapy (4 cycles of cisplatin-vinorelbine) was given to 16 patients (33.3%) at physician discretion. Patients with a FOXP3 expression of 25% or higher significantly lower OS and DFS when compared with patients with a FOXP3 staining lower than 25% with p-value of 0.016 and 0.032, respectively. In the patients with high FOXP3 expression, platin-based adjuvant chemotherapy had showed a detrimental effect on DFS and OS. These results suggest that FOXP3 expression may be used as useful prognostic biomarker in resected NSCLC. Our findings also suggest that resected NSCLC patients with FOXP3 expression of 25%\u00a0or higher staining intensity may not get any benefit even disfavor from adjuvant platin chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Carcinoma of the cervix is the second most successive reason of female cancer which remains an imperative medical issue in women around the world. Mutations are normally dissected by tissue biopsy which is intrusive, costly and possibly subjective. However, detection of mutations from blood\u00a0is a non-invasive procedure. However, detection of mutations from blood is a non-invasive procedure. It would offer several advantages, including greater speed and cheap at a cost such that the family members can likewise be screened. Repeated tests after surgery provide an early cautioning for the disease recurrence. The present work aimed to assess the frequency of PIK3CA and HRAS mutations in cervical cancer patients using peripheral blood. This study includes 210 cases presenting cervical cancer and 210 age and sex-matched healthy controls. Genomic DNA was isolated\u00a0from peripheral blood. The PCR-CTPP method was performed for screening of exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA and exon 34 HRAS mutations. Sequencing of PIK3CA and of HRAS genes was done for further confirmation. Out of eight mutations studied, no clear disease causing mutations were noticed in any of the cervical cancer patients in the present investigation. Cervical cancer harbors excessive rates of targetable oncogenic mutations. We couldn't find any changes in our investigation. If a connection amongst tissue and non-tissue mutations could be shown, the probability of a basic blood\u00a0test to distinguish possibility for anticancer treatment comes a bit nearer. Repeated blood tests after surgery provide an early cautioning for disease recurrence. Therefore, in future evaluation of a larger data set and cases with progressive tumor (Stage III\u2013IV) will be required to approve these findings.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio for the diagnosis of TCa. The patients who underwent orchiectomy in our unit reviewed retrospectively. Age of the patients, the laboratory results and pathological reports were recorded. The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated as the neutrophil counts divided to the lymphocyte counts. The patients were divided into two groups according to the pathology record. The testicular malign neoplasms are included in group 1 and group 2 includes the patients who had cryptorchidism and atrophic testes without any malignancy and inflammation. For statistical analysis, student t test was used for comparing the data between groups and the area under curves were used for NLR, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in the diagnosis of testicular malign neoplasms.There were 285 patients in the present study. The patients' age was between 10 and 90 with a mean age of 36.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.83 and 37.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.31 years in groups respectively.The neutrophil, white blood cell counts and NLR were significantly higher in group 1 and lymphocye count was lower in patients with testicular cancer with statistical significance. The area under curve was 0.645, 0.626, 0.578 for NLR, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts for the diagnosis of TCa. Mixed germ cell tumor was the most common histologic subtype with an incidence of 51.58%(n:65 patients) and seminomas were reported 37.30% (n:47 patients) of the patients. Testicular cancer has low incidence when compared the other urologic malignancies. There are only three tumor markers that include alpha-fetaprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin and lactate dehydrogenase for testicular cancer diagnosis.

Cancer cells also need to adapt their metabolism to survive and multiply under the metabolically compromised conditions provided by the tumor microenvironment. Tumor cells alter their metabolism to maintain unregulated cellular proliferation and survival, but this transformation leaves them reliant on constant supply of nutrients and energy. They alter their metabolism to support their rapid proliferation and expansion across the body. After the discovery of based on the altered cancer cell metabolism in 1930, loads of studies have shed light on several aspects of cancer metabolism with a common goal to find new ways for effectively eliminating tumor cells by targeting their energy metabolism. Research has directed most of its resources to elucidate the causes, prevention and possible cure for cancer, yet the process has been elusive claiming human lives more than ever. This disease is a manifestation of etiological and pathological disturbances of mechanisms that control cell division, differentiation and metabolism. 50% of all human tumors carry genetic alterations that lead to the inactivation of some tumor suppressor proteins. Cancer cells are shown to experience characteristic changes in their metabolic programs, including increased uptake of glucose, enhanced rates of glutaminolysis and fatty acids synthesis, suggesting that metabolic shifts supports tumor cells growth and survival.

The roles of dyes to aid identification of diagnosis in these two classes of lesions are of importance. The aim of this research was to determine the prevalence of malignant and benign lesions in the female genitalia and their receptivities to seven histochemical dyes.Six hundred and thirty two (n\u00a0=\u00a0632) gynaecological malignant and benign lesions data collected from the archives of the Histopathology Laboratory of Braithwaite Memorial Specialist Hospital (BMSH), Port Harcourt, Nigeria between 2010 and 2014 were used for this study. The representative tissues were sectioned and stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Masson's Trichrome (MT), Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS), Phosphotungstic Acid Haematoxylin (PTAH), Southgate Mucincamine (SGM), Alcian Blue (AB) and Verhoeff Van Gieson (VVG) dyes.We identified 601 (95.1%) benign and 31 (4.9%) malignant lesions during the 5-year period. The mean and standard deviation (\u00b1SD) of patients' age associated with the malignant and benign tissues were 47.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.7 and 37.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.2 years. There were significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) associations in the distribution of lesions by age category, reproductive status, region, and origin of tissue, but not by year of diagnosis and developmental stage (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Stain analyses revealed significant variations in the receptivity of the seven dye-tissues with the mean % area for benign lesions ranging from 38.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.60% in SGM to 64.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.04% in MT and those of malignant lesions ranging from 37.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.71% in AB to 63.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.94% in MT.

In rare cases, thrombocytopenia may occur suddenly in approximately 24 hours due to immune-mediated reactions. This reaction is usually seen after long term usage of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Here, we present our case of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia associated with oxaliplatin.A 56 years old man who had stage IV rectum cancer with liver metastasis, had palliative surgery due to bowel obstruction after initial diagnostic approach. After failure of first line treatment, mFOLFOX6 plus Cetuximab (Cetuximab: 500mg/m2 on day 1, Oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m2 day 1, Leucovorin (LV): 400 mg/m2 day 1, 5-FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus on day 1 followed by 2400 mg/m2 on day 1 infused over 46 hours every two weeks) regimen was started. Before the 21st cycle of oxaliplatin plus cetuximab regimen, the patient had normal thrombocyte, haemoglobin and neutrophile count. Approximately 8 hours after the chemotherapy patient had been taken to the emergency service with petechia, vigorous gastrointestinal and nasal bleeding. The thrombocyte levels were 3000 at \u03bcl. The patient was given methylprednisolone for three days. The thrombocyte levels recover quickly in 24 hours. After this reaction, oxaliplatin stopped and the chemotherapy was changed to capesitabine plus cetuximab regimen.In conclusion, oxaliplatin induced immune-mediated thrombocytopenia is a rare side effect but a life threatening complication. A physician who uses oxaliplatin as a treatment option should keep in mind the possibility immune-mediated thrombocytopenia which may cause life-threatening bleeding. Especially the long term use of oxaliplatin (median >10 cycles) may alert the physician for immune-mediated adverse effects.",

Two cases of parathyroid carcinoma are described, one with a late diagnosis after previous surgeries for parathyroid hyperplasia, and the other diagnosed after pathologic fracture. The aim of this article is to make a review on recent parathyroid carcinoma literature and discuss these two illustrating cases. There has not been established any etiology for parathyroid carcinoma and no predisposing factors were identified. Parathyroid carcinoma may occur sporadically or as part of a genetic syndrome. The clinical features of parathyroid carcinoma are similar to benign cases of hyperparathyroidism and the pathologic diagnose is difficult. In the absence of metastatic disease in addition to a similar clinical setting, it can be difficult to distinguish benign and malignant hyperparathyroidism. Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare disease which diagnose can be challenging. Recent advances in immunohistochemical analysis may have helped in histopathologic evaluation, but pre-operative detection relies on imaging exams that may not differentiate malignant from benign hyperparathyroidism. The first surgical approach is paramount for disease control. There is still few effective therapeutic options for recurrent and metastatic disease, and these patients' prognostic status remain poor. Promising results were observed with denosumab and PTH immunization, and they may be a useful therapy for advanced cases in the future, but further investigation is required.",

We aimed to report a series of 7 cases of MBC treated in our clinics.Between 2006 and 2015, 7 cases with diagnosis of MBC were retrospectively reviewed. Patients' characteristics, clinicopathological features and types of surgery were evaluated.All patients were female with a median age of 51(40\u201365) years. Median tumor size was 40\u00a0mm (35\u201385\u00a0mm). Two patients had breast-conserving surgery and 4 patients had mastectomy. One patient received chemotherapy due to extensive metastatic disease at the time of presentation. Only one patient had one positive sentinel lymph node with no other involvement in the non-sentinel nodes. Two patients had spindle cell carcinoma, 2 patients had pure epithelial type, and 3 patients had mixed epithelial and mesenchymal type MBC. Most common component of MBC was squamous cell metaplasia that was found in 4 out of 7 patients. Six patients had triple negative tumors except the patient with disseminated disease. This patient had estrogen receptor positive, progesterone receptor negative tumor with human epithelial receptor-2 (HER2) over-expression. Median Ki67 score measured in 5 patients was 57% (40\u201395%).Our small series is consistent with the literature. MBC rarely metastasize to axillary lymph nodes despite large size and are usually triple negative with high Ki-67 scores indicating aggressiveness and lack of response to hormonal therapy.

In an attempt to improve survival, the efficacy of chemoradiation (CRT) after surgery compared to observation has been tested in several trials. Neoadjuvant CRT achieves a higher probability of margin negative R0 resection.

Antiproliferative effects of sorafenib have been evaluated by using colorectal DLD-1 cell line. Materials and Methods: For determining the effects of sorafenib on colorectal cell, Real time analysis was performed. Chorioallantoic membrane model (CAM) was used for assessing angiogenesis. Different concentrations of sorafenib (500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.25, 15.62, 7.81, 3.9, 1.95, 0.97 and 0.48\u00a0nM/well) applied on DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells, caused strong antiproliferative effect in a concentration manner. IC50 value of sorafenib was 1.26\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010-9\u00a0M. Sorafenib (100, 10 and 1\u00a0nM) also showed strong angiogenic effect in CAM model with scores 1.05, 0.75 and 0.55. The present study indicates that sorafenib has strong antitumor and antiangiogenic affect. These important features make it valuable treatment agent for colorectal cancer which is strongly connected to angiogenic factors.

Cases had been followed up in Dicle University Medical Faculty Medical Oncology clinic between January 2006 and June 2013. Data was collected retrospectively from the medical records of the patients. Classical parameters, which are considered to affect the prognosis, such as age, gender, stage, tumor localization and performance status, were investigated, in addition to educational status and the living environment.The study comprised 171 cases.

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in adults. The etiology of GBM is not known, and the prognosis is usually very poor. Despite new diagnostic techniques and treatment methods, the management of patients with GBM is difficult.Currently, the standard of care for the treatment of GBM is surgical resection, followed by concurrent RT with temozolomide, completed by adjuvant CT with temozolomide. Despite the survival benefit associated with these treatments, the majority of patients relapse following initial therapy. Unfortunately, optimal management for patients with recurrent or progressive GBM is unclear.In general, treatment for recurrent GBM may involve repeated resection, focal irradiation, and systemic therapies. When considering in terms of chemotherapy regimen, bevacizumab and irinotecan combination therapy for the progressive GBM may be used a suitable regimen. Also complete response in case of recurrent GBM is very rare.We present two cases with GBM who had complete response with bevacizumab plus irinotecan as second-line CT regimen, which rapidly progressed after surgery, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and first-line temozolomide therapy.Signs of rapid proliferation in the pathologic specimen of both cases were recorded. During follow-up both cases developed recurrent tumor within a month after first three cycles first-line temozolomide CT.",

The popularity of e-cigarette has increased rapidly in recent years. The increase in its use during the adolescence period is attention-grabbing. Despite the fact that e-cigarette has become popular in a dramatic way, there are certain differences of opinion regarding its long-term effects on health, in particular. While some people assert that it is less harmful than conventional cigarettes, some others assert the contrary. Although e-cigarette contains less toxic substances compared to conventional cigarette, it contains certain carcinogens existing in conventional cigarette such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. It also contains heavy metals (nickel, chrome) that conventional cigarette does not contain; and therefore, raises concerns about health. E-cigarette leads to upper and lower respiratory tract irritation as well as an increased airway resistance and an increased bacterial colonization in the respiratory tract. It may also cause tahcycardia and increase diastolic blood pressure. Although e-cigarette has been found to have certain benefits in terms of smoking cessation, most of the studies have shown unfavorable results. In this collected work, the effects of e-cigarette on health and its role in smoking cessation are discussed in detail.",

The major bioactive component of Nigella sativa, thymoquinone (TQ) might limit the nephrotoxic effect of cisplatin in low doses. However, it is not clear how it can affect the kidney as an anti-cytotoxic agent when administered in higher doses or in cisplatin co-treatment. Therefore, we examined the in\u00a0vivo interactions between cisplatin and TQ by measuring serum cystatin C (cys C), creatinine and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels and analyzing the expression status of p53 and NGAL by immunohistochemistry.Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Control, TQ treatment (group II; 40\u00a0mg/kg i.p. for 5 days), cisplatin treatment (group III; 7\u00a0mg/kg, i.p. for at day 3) and TQ and cisplatin co-treatment (group IV).Administration of 40\u00a0mg/kg TQ had no effect on serum kidney parameters. In cisplatin received group's serum creatinine level was insignificant, but serum Csy C and NGAL levels were significantly increased. All serum creatinine, NGAL and Cys C levels were increased in co-treatment of cisplatin and TQ. Additionally, in this group, renal tubular damage was found significantly higher than both control and only cisplatin-treated groups. The kidney immunohistochemistry staining of NGAL and p53 were significantly more intense in group IV rather than the others.This study showed that the administration of cisplatin and high dose of TQ act synergistically to produce nephrotoxicity and the involvement of apoptotic pathway and proximal tubule damage might be the leading cause of on this effect.",
