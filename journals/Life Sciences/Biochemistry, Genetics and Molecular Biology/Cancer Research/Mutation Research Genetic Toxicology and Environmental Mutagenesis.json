     "abstract": "To assess the effects of exposure to pesticides in tea garden women workers, the present study evaluated the activities of erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) as biomarkers of pesticide exposure and DNA damage by comet assay as a biomarker of genotoxicity in peripheral blood lymphocytes. We examined 143 women subjects including 77 women workers exposed to pesticide in tea garden (exposed) and 66 women subject with no history of occupational exposure to pesticides (non-exposed). The two groups had similar mean ages, BMI and personal habits. The results revealed that exposed group had lower activity of AChE (2.86\u2009\u00b1\u20090.75 vs. 3.93\u2009\u00b1\u20090.87\u2009U/ml) BChE (2.02\u2009\u00b1\u20090.74 vs. 2.60\u2009\u00b1\u20090.74\u2009U/ml, p\u2009<\u20090.001) than those of non-exposed group. The mean comet parameters such as tail length (TL), % DNA in tail, tail moment (TM) and olive tail moment (OTM) used to measure DNA damage were significantly elevated in exposed workers compared to non-exposed (p\u2009<\u20090.001). There was no variation observed in Cholinesterase (ChEs) activity and Comet assay parameter based on age, personal habits, years of exposure and use of personal protective equipments (PPEs) except BChE activity. The multiple regression analysis showed no association of confounding factors on end points measured except slight negative association of BMI with tail length. Therefore this study suggests that the workers in tea garden might have exposed to pesticide through their occupation on a regular interval. Although this study could able to associate it with their occupational exposure, the role of other DNA damaging factors cannot be ruled out. Our study finding indicate the necessity of periodic monitoring of these biomarkers along with imparting education and training to minimise the risk.",

     "abstract": "Graphene is a two-dimensional (2D) monolayer of carbon atoms, tightly packed, forming a honey comb crystal lattice, with physical, chemical, and mechanical properties greatly used for energy storage, electrochemical devices, and in nanomedicine. Many studies showed that nanomaterials have side-effects on health. At present, there is a lack of information regarding graphene and its derivatives including their cardiotoxic properties. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the toxicity of nano-graphene oxide (nano-GO) in the rat cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2 and the involvement of oxidative processes. The cell viability was evaluated with the fluorescein diacetate (FDA)/propidium iodide (PI) and in the trypan blue exclusion assay, furthermore mitochondrial membrane potential and production of free radicals were measured. Genotoxicity was evaluated in comet assay and low molecular weight DNA experiment. Reduction of cell viability with 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL nano-GO was observed after 24\u2009h incubation. Besides, nano-GO induced a mitochondrial hyperpolarization and a significant increase of free radicals production in the same concentrations. DNA breaks were observed at 40, 60, 80, and 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL. This DNA damage was accompanied by a significant increase in LMW DNA only at 40\u2009\u03bcg/mL. In conclusion, the nano-GO caused cardiotoxicity in our in vitro model, with mitochondrial disturbances, generation of reactive species and interactions with DNA, indicating the importance of the further evaluation of the safety of nanomaterials.",

     "publication date": "04-2019",
     "abstract": "DNA damage is ubiquitous and can arise from endogenous or exogenous sources. DNA-damaging alkylating agents are present in environmental toxicants as well as in cancer chemotherapy drugs and are a constant threat, which can lead to mutations or cell death. All organisms have multiple DNA repair and DNA damage tolerance pathways to resist the potentially negative effects of exposure to alkylating agents. In bacteria, many of the genes in these pathways are regulated as part of the SOS reponse or the adaptive response. In this work, we probed the cellular responses to the alkylating agents chloroacetaldehyde (CAA), which is a metabolite of 1,2-dichloroethane used to produce polyvinyl chloride, and styrene oxide (SO), a major metabolite of styrene used in the production of polystyrene and other polymers. Vinyl chloride and styrene are produced on an industrial scale of billions of kilograms annually and thus have a high potential for environmental exposure. To identify stress response genes in E. coli that are responsible for tolerance to the reactive metabolites CAA and SO, we used libraries of transcriptional reporters and gene deletion strains. In response to both alkylating agents, genes associated with several different stress pathways were upregulated, including protein, membrane, and oxidative stress, as well as DNA damage. E. coli strains lacking genes involved in base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair were sensitive to SO, whereas strains lacking recA and the SOS gene ybfE were sensitive to both alkylating agents tested. This work indicates the varied systems involved in cellular responses to alkylating agents, and highlights the specific DNA repair genes involved in the responses.",

No treatment has been successfully employed to get rid against ZEN contained in foods and/or mitigates its genotoxicity. This study was conducted to evaluate the ability of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from Tunisia traditional butter, Lactobacillus plantarum MON03 (LP) to protect mice against cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by ZEN. Two doses of LP (2\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 CFU/L, \u223c2\u2009mg/kg and 4\u2009\u00d7\u2009109 CFU/L, \u223c4\u2009mg/kg) was added alone or in combination with a toxic intragastric ZEN (40\u2009mg/kg representing 8% of LD50) dose daily for 2 wk by oral gavage. The control group received distilled water. The positive control groups received Colchicin (4\u2009mg/kg bw) for the micronucleus assay and mitomycin C (1\u2009mg/kg bw) for the chromosome aberrations assay. 48\u2009h after treatment, the small intestines, femur and tibia are dissected out. Small intestines were collected for the determination of DNA fragmentation, genes expression and target proteins content. The results show that ZEN was cytotoxic and genotoxic to mice as indicated by the increase in frequencies of polychromatic erythrocytes micronucleated (PCEMN) and chromosomal aberrations in bone marrow cells. In the small intestine ZEN was increased DNA fragmentation, down regulated the expressions of caspase-3, caspase-9, and Bax as well as up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 and their target proteins. The simultaneous intragastric administration of LP with ZEN resulted in a decrease of PCEMN number and chromosomal aberrations frequency and in an increase of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) in bone marrow cells compared with the group treated with ZEN alone. In addition, LP succeeded to alleviate the disturbances in DNA fragmentation and the expression of these genes and their target proteins.It could be concluded that the use of LP induced protective effects against genotoxicity of ZEN in part through adhesion and so likely diminished its bio-availability in gastro-intestinal tract.",

     "abstract": "Periodontitis is a bacterial infection characterized by the presence of a dense inflammatory infiltrate, which may result in increased DNA damage and other nuclear/cellular abnormalities. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the periodontal diseases influence on DNA damage and other nuclear/cellular abnomalies formation as cancer risk markers. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal diseases effect, according to its severity, on the occurrence of DNA damage and other nuclear/cellular abnormalities. This is a cross-sectional study with 77 subjects from the dentistry clinic of the University of Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil, divided in control group (26 subjects), moderate periodontal disease group (26 subjects) and severe periodontal disease group (25 subjects). All subjects answered self-referenced questionnaires, underwent periodontal clinical examinations and allowed the collection of oral mucosa cells for the BMCyt. In relation to DNA damage biomarkers (micronuclei (MN) and/or nuclear buds (NBUD)), our results indicated no increase in MN frequencies (p\u2009>\u20090.05), however it indicated significant difference in NBUD frequencies between groups (p\u2009<\u20090.024). This result suggests that the periodontal disease status may influence DNA damage. Regarding the other nuclear/cellular abnormalities, was observed a significant difference in the binucleated (BN) frequencies between groups (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, the periodontitis severity was associated to an increase in the combined (summed) frequency of cells with different levels of DNA damage (MN and/or NBUD), cytokinetic defects (BN cells) and/or cell death (karyorrhexis, pyknotic and karyolytic cells) (r\u2009=\u20090.235; p\u2009=\u20090.040).

     "abstract": "High fidelity DNA repair is critical to sustain the genomic integrity and quality of developing germ cells. Deficiencies in DNA repair machinery may result in increased DNA damage in germ cell leading to abnormal spermatogenesis and infertility. X-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1) is a testis enriched protein that plays a crucial role in the DNA base excision repair (BER) pathway. The aim of this study was to analyze the level of XRCC1 transcript and protein in infertile men and its association with DNA damage in sperm. A total of eighty infertile patients with different infertile phenotypes (Azoospermia, n\u2009=\u200930; Severe oligozoospermia, n\u2009=\u200925; Severe oligoasthenozoospermia, n\u2009=\u200925) and age-matched controls (normal spermatogenesis [NS], n\u2009=\u200915 and fertile controls, n\u2009=\u200910) were recruited. \u03b3-H2\u2009AX protein levels were analyzed to estimate the DNA damage in sperm. XRCC1 transcript levels in cases and controls were determined by qRT-PCR. XRCC1 and \u03b3-H2\u2009AX proteins were immunohistochemically analyzed in testicular biopsy sections obtained from NOA patients and OA controls. The determination of XRCC1 and \u03b3-H2\u2009AX protein levels was performed with Western blots. The results revealed reduced expression of XRCC1 mRNA and protein in infertile individuals as compared to controls (p\u2009<\u20090.001). \u03b3-H2\u2009AX levels were significantly increased in infertile cases as compared to controls, indicating increased DNA damage in infertile men.

Two human bronchial epithelia cell lines (HBE and BEAS-2B) were used. Human gene expression profile microarray was performed to investigate the alteration of gene expression in PM2.5-treated HBE cells. The results of ROS assay and ELISA indicated that PM2.5 (150\u2009\u03bcg/ml) increased the level of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promoted the release of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in HBE cells. CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 were the top two up-regulated genes by PM2.5 (150\u2009\u03bcg/ml, 48\u2009h of exposure) in HBE cells. Co-knockdown of CYP1A1/1B1 by siRNA substantially inhibited PM2.5-induced ROS generation, IL-6/IL-8 secretion and STAT3/P-STAT3 expression. Similarly, the knockdown of STAT3 also effectively inhibited PM2.5-induced rise in ROS level and IL-6/IL-8 secretion. In summary, PM2.5 mediated oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response via up-regulating the expression of CYP1A1/1B1 in two human bronchial epithelial cell lines.",

Carbon-ion irradiation caused BM cell DNA damage, apoptosis, elevated ROS, and myelosuppression. Transcriptomic analysis showed that overall gene expression in irradiated BM cells differed significantly from the controls. Of 253 genes that were modulated, 192 were up-regulated and 61 down-regulated. Gene ontology analysis showed that the modulated genes are involved in DNA damage response signaling, DNA repair, apoptosis, and the immune response. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis indicated that these functions are regulated by the p38 MAPK, TNF, and apoptosis pathways. These findings indicate pathways that may be involved in protection against carbon ion radiation injury.",

     "abstract": "A database of 91 chemicals with published data from both transgenic rodent mutation (TGR) and rodent comet assays has been compiled. The objective was to compare the sensitivity of the two assays for detecting genotoxicity. Critical aspects of study design and results were tabulated for each dataset. There were fewer datasets from rats than mice, particularly for the TGR assay, and therefore, results from both species were combined for further analysis. TGR and comet responses were compared in liver and bone marrow (the most commonly studied tissues), and in stomach and colon evaluated either separately or in combination with other GI tract segments. Overall positive, negative, or equivocal test results were assessed for each chemical across the tissues examined in the TGR and comet assays using two approaches: 1) overall calls based on weight of evidence (WoE) and expert judgement, and 2) curation of the data based on a priori acceptability criteria prior to deriving final tissue specific calls. Since the database contains a high prevalence of positive results, overall agreement between the assays was determined using statistics adjusted for prevalence (using AC1 and PABAK). These coefficients showed fair or moderate to good agreement for liver and the GI tract (predominantly stomach and colon data) using WoE, reduced agreement for stomach and colon evaluated separately using data curation, and poor or no agreement for bone marrow using both the WoE and data curation approaches. Confidence in these results is higher for liver than for the other tissues, for which there were less data. Our analysis finds that comet and TGR generally identify the same compounds (mainly potent mutagens) as genotoxic in liver, stomach and colon, but not in bone marrow. However, the current database content precluded drawing assay concordance conclusions for weak mutagens and non-DNA reactive chemicals.",

DNA damage was also determined in the liver in comet assays, as DMH is metabolized and activated in this organ. The time-response patterns of DNA damage in the liver and colon were similar in both rats, and maximum values were observed at 3\u2009h after the treatment.

The frequency of MNed cells in non-treated animals was similar in the GF and Cvd rats. In addition, we determined time-responses in the incidence of apoptosis and cell proliferation indices, i.e., the numbers of BrdU-labeled cells, mitotic cells in the crypts, and crypt column heights, using histological sections of the colons in these rats. Maximal incidence of apoptosis was observed at 6 and 24\u2009h in the Cvd and GF rats, respectively. The value in the Cvd rats tended to be higher than that in the GF rats.

The rebound response of cell proliferation was more pronounced and occurred earlier in the Cvd rats than that in the GF rats.

This was determined by qPCR and principal component analysis (PCA), as the aim of an in vivo short-term screening for genotoxic hepatocarcinogens. For this paper, we conducted an application study of the 12 mouse marker genes to rat data, Open TG-GATEs (public data). We analyzed five typical rat GTHC (2-acetamodofluorene, aflatoxin B1, 2-nitrofluorene, N-nitrosodiethylamine and N-nitrosomorpholine), and not only seven typical rat NGTHC (clofibrate, ethanol, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, hexachlorobenzene, phenobarbital and WY-14643) but also 11 non-genotoxic non-hepatocarcinogens (NGTNHC; allyl alcohol, aspirin, caffeine, chlorpheniramine, chlorpropamide, dexamethasone, diazepam, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, theophylline and tolbutamide) from Open TG-GATEs. The analysis was performed at 3, 6, 9 and 24\u2009h after a single administration and 4, 8, 15 and 29 days after repeated administrations. We transferred Open TG-GATEs DNA microarray data into log2 data using the \u201cR Project for Statistical Computing\u201d. GTHC-specific dose-dependent gene expression changes were observed and significance assessed with the Williams test. Similar significant changes were observed during 3\u201324\u2009h and 4\u201329 days, assessed with Welch\u2019s t-test, except not for NGTHC or NGTNHC. Significant differential changes in gene expression were observed between GTHC and NGTHC in 11 genes (except not Tubb4b) and between GTHC and NGTNHC in all 12 genes at 24\u2009h and 10 genes (except Ccnf and Mbd1) at 29 days, per Tukey\u2019s test. PCA successfully discriminated GTHC from NGTHC and NGTNHC at 24\u2009h and 29 days.

     "abstract": "DNA damage measured by the comet assay is a well-established biomarker in studies on environmental and occupational exposures, dietary factors and clinical outcomes. Age and sex are typically regarded as confounding factors that are controlled by either selective inclusion criteria of subjects or adjustment in the statistical analysis. This review assesses the influence of age and sex on levels of DNA damage in leukocytes in study populations of healthy subjects. Analysis of unadjusted results in the studies indicates that the level of DNA strand breaks increases by 1% per year (95% CI: 0.9%\u20131.1%, linear regression analysis weighted for the number of subjects in the individual studies). The studies also show a slightly higher level of DNA strand breaks in men than women (8%, 95% CI: 0.4%\u201317%) in unadjusted analyses, which is not robust in studies with adjusted analyses. The attenuation of effect in adjusted analyses of DNA strand breaks in leukocytes indicates that the effect of age and sex may be driven by differences in lifestyle factors or other exposures. There do not appear to be differences related to age and sex on basal levels of oxidatively damaged DNA in leukocytes. In summary, the results indicate influences of both age and sex on DNA damage in the comet assay, which may be mediated by lifestyle factors or external exposures rather than direct effects of age and sex.",

     "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most widely utilized endocrine disruptors to which humans are exposed, particularity through ingestion. BPA is an aneugenic compound with a putative association to tumorigenesis. Although extensively studied in estrogen responsive cells, information regarding its effects on cells from the upper gastrointestinal tract exposed to free/active forms of BPA is still scarce. Similarly, BPA interactions with other drugs have been neglected, although it has been suggested to have a potential role in doxorubicin (DOX) chemoresistance. This study is intended to assess potential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of BPA, as well as its interactions with DOX, in Human epithelial type 2 cells (Hep-2) originated from a human laryngeal carcinoma and in a DNA damage responsive cell line, the human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5). Cell viability was analyzed through the resazurin assay. The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1 (GPER) expression was visualized by immunodetection. Genotoxicity, namely DNA damage and oxidative DNA damage, were assessed by comet assay and micronuclei induction, and mitotic disruption was evaluated cytologically by fluorescent microscopy with DAPI staining. Cytotoxicity analysis showed that exposure to BPA per se does not affect cellular viability. Nevertheless, the genotoxic analysis showed that BPA induced an increase of DNA damage in the Hep-2 cell line and in oxidative damage in the MRC-5 cell line. An increase of micronuclei was also observed in both cell lines following BPA exposure. BPA and DOX co-exposures suggested that BPA acts as an antagonist of DOX effects in both cell lines. The interaction with DOX appears to be cell type dependent, exhibiting a non-monotonic response curve in MRC-5 cells, a GPER expressing cell line. Our study emphasizes the need for a deeper knowledge of BPA interactions, particularly with chemotherapeutic agents, in the context of risk assessment and public health.",

     "abstract": "We investigated the relationship between metabolic activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes present in microsomal fractions derived from the livers of 78 donors and micronucleus induction by cyclophosphamide (CPA). Consequently, a wide inter-individual variation in CYP activities was observed among the 78 donors. The CYP activities were partially correlated with the metabolic phenotypes predicted for the donors based on their single nucleotide polymorphisms. In addition, CPA induced micronucleus formation was seen for 47 out of 52 donors whose samples were tested with CPA doses ranging from 18.8 to 100\u2009\u03bcg/mL. The CPA dose at which micronucleated cells were observed varied among the donors. Furthermore, a close correlation was identified between the catalytic activities of the CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 isozymes and micronucleus induction by CPA. To elucidate the mechanism underlying CPA-induced micronucleus formation in vitro tests were conducted on expression systems of CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. Additionally, the metabolites of CPA generated by the expression systems were quantified by a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer. Interestingly, several metabolites including the 4-hydroxyl form of CPA (4-OH-CPA) and phosphamide mustard were detected in the CYP2B6, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 expression systems, but not in the CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 system. The presence of these metabolites was correlated with micronucleus induction by CPA. The absence of CPA metabolites in the CYP2C9 expression system might be associated with the lower 4-hydroxylase activity of this system.The present results suggest that inter-individual variability in the metabolic capacity of each donor was associated with potential micronucleus induction due to CPA. Additionally, CPA metabolites like 4-OH-CPA and phosphamide mustard produced by human CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 are suggested to be major determinants of micronucleus induction by CPA.",

This study aimed to estimate novel biomarkers for early prediction of liver malignancy due to occupational exposure to pesticides in two groups of workers with different socioeconomic standard (highly educated urban researchers and low educated rural pesticides sprayers). This study included 50 urban researchers and 50 rural pesticides sprayers occupationally exposed to pesticides. They were compared with 50 non-exposed urban researchers and 50 non-exposed rural subjects. Several tumor biomarkers were estimated; P53 protein, Alfa fetoprotein (AFP), and Alpha-L-fucosidase (AFU). Additionally, telomerase enzyme activity, Relative telomere length (RTL), and DNA damage using comet assay were measured. Furthermore, the glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) gene polymorphisms were identified for both exposed groups. Statistical analysis revealed elevated level of tumor biomarkers among exposed subjects relative to control groups in spite of being within the normal range. Increase in the DNA damage was detected, with shortening of telomere length and decrease in telomerase enzyme activity in pesticides-exposed subjects compared to their controls. Most of these changes were related to the levels of butyrylcholinesterase. Subjects with GSTT1 genotype were suggested to be more susceptible to hepatic carcinogenicity. Telomere relative length and comets assay together with GST genes polymorphisms could be used as early predictors for liver cancer susceptibility among pesticides exposed workers.",

Induced DNA damage in lymphocytes was measured using \u03b3-H2AX, p53Ser\u221215, chromosome aberrations, and micronucleus formation in subjects (n\u2009=\u200925) who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT.

Kowary was chosen because of uranium mineralisation in its close vicinity.Whole population studied was divided into two groups: exposed to low radon activity concentrations resulting in the exposure of \u22640.55\u2009WLM (value corresponding to the exposure to 100\u2009Bq/m3 during whole year), and exposed to high radon activity concentration (>0.55\u2009WLM). In the two groups two selected biomarkers in blood were assessed: the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN) on peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and the levels of anti-p53 antibodies in serum measured because some data indicate increased expression of the antibodies in individuals after exposure to DNA damaging agents including radon. The potential confounding factors known to influence micronuclei (MN) frequency were also measured in serum: vitamin B12, folic acid, as well as total calcium.In the present study no significant correlation was found between MN frequency in PBL and radon exposure. Among all persons investigated only 11 had detectable levels of the anti-p53 antibodies, whereas only 3 persons had positive result. Therefore, the group was too small to perform any meaningful statistical analysis and to conclude on any association. Cigarette smoking did not significantly influence the number of MN. There was a significant positive correlation observed between MN frequency and age, as well as higher MN frequency was detected in women.The problem of the radon exposure is still unresolved and needs further studies on bigger human cohorts in order to search for more sensitive biomarkers.",

For this purpose, we conducted integrated toxicity tests combining gene mutation assays with multiple-organ micronucleus (MN) tests (peripheral blood, bone marrow, liver, and colon) in F344 gpt delta transgenic (Tg) rats. Seven-week-old male F344 gpt delta rats were orally administered 62.5 or 125\u2009mg/kg/day benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) for 28 days. One day after the final day of treatment (day 29) and three days after the final treatment (day 31), bone marrow, liver, and colon samples were collected, and mutation assays and MN tests were performed. The gpt mutant frequency (MF) significantly increased in bone marrow, liver and colon but MN induction was only significant in bone marrow but not in liver and colon. Similarly MN induction was only observed in bone marrow in non-Tg F344 rats. In peripheral blood obtained on day 4, 15, 29, 31, a time-dependent increase was observed in reticulocyte MN frequency during the treatment. Thus, our integrated method successfully detected both gene mutations and MN induction caused by B[a]P. In addition, no significant differences were observed between sampling times (day 29 versus 31), suggesting that sampling on day 29 is also valid to evaluate gene mutations. On the other hand, MN results in bone marrow and peripheral blood were different depending on the sampling day. An appropriate sampling day should be designated according to which assays are integrated. We confirmed that integration of the MN test with a gene mutation assay using F344 gpt delta Tg rats is useful to evaluate different endpoints related to genotoxicity using the same animals and to reduce animal use.",

In the present study, we investigated the ability of 1,4-dioxane to induce micronuclei in the liver and bone marrow of rats. For the liver micronucleus test, we performed the juvenile animal method and two methods using partial hepatectomy (PH), dosing before PH or dosing after PH. We also evaluated the in vivo mutagenicity of 1,4-dioxane by Pig-a gene mutation assay using rat peripheral blood. As a result, all methods of liver micronucleus test showed an increase in the frequency of micronucleated hepatocytes by 1,4-dioxane. The dosing before PH, a suitable method for detecting structural chromosome aberration inducers, showed the clearest response for micronucleated hepatocytes induction among the three methods. This finding is consistent with a previous report that 1,4-dioxane induces mainly chromosome breakage in the liver. Negative results were obtained in the bone marrow micronucleus test and Pig-a gene mutation assay in our study. These results suggested that 1,4-dioxane is clastogenic in the liver but not genotoxic in the bone marrow of rats.",

     "abstract": "A database of the micronuclei counts was built up for historical negative control data from human lymphocyte in vitro micronuclei tests (MnVit) carried out in 8 laboratories with experience of the method. The mean incidence of micronucleated cells (mnt)/1000 cells ranged from 2.2/1000 to 15.9/1000. There were no large differences in incidence between the presence or absence of S9 mix or between different treatment lengths. There was also little evidence that different solvents affected the numbers of micronuclei appreciably. A number of laboratories did show significant inter-experiment variability, indicating that there remained unidentified factors affecting frequencies. Donor variance may be one such factor. Inter-individual variability may explain some of these differences. The approximate 7.5-fold difference in mnt/1000 scores in a relatively small group of experienced laboratories illustrates the potential complications that can arise if a metric like a fold increase was considered the only biologically important finding. Although there is inherent variability between experiments, it was evident that within a laboratory the overall laboratory mean remains constant over time. It is believed that these findings will provide help to laboratories conducting studies using human lymphocytes in the MnVit and to those involved in the assessment of MnVit results.",

Several in vitro and in vivo assays have been used for evaluating the genotoxicity of tobacco smoke and tobacco smoke constituents like NNK, yet it is not clear which in vitro assays are most appropriate for extrapolating the in vitro responses of these test agents to animal models and humans. The Pig-a gene mutation assay can be performed in vitro, in laboratory animals, and in humans, a potential benefit in estimating in vivo responses from in vitro data. In the current study we used Pig-a as a reporter of gene mutation both in vitro, in L5178Y/Tk+/\u2212 cells, and in vivo, in Sprague-Dawley rats. NNK significantly increased Pig-a mutant frequency in L5178Y/Tk+/\u2212 cells, but only at concentrations of 100\u2009\u03bcg/ml and greater, and only in the presence of S9 activation. Pig-a mutations in L5178Y/Tk+/\u2212 cells were detected in 80% of the NNK-induced mutants, with the predominate mutation being G\u2192A transition; vehicle control mutants contained deletions. In the in vivo study, rats were exposed to NNK daily for 90 days by inhalation, a common route of exposure to NNK for humans. Although elevated mutant frequencies were detected, these responses were not clearly associated with NNK exposure, so that overall, the in vivo Pig-a assays were negative. Thus, while NNK induces mutations in the in vitro Pig-a assay, the in vivo Pig-a assay has limited ability to detect NNK mutagenicity under conditions relevant to NNK exposure in smokers.",

The study population comprised 129 agricultural workers exposed to pesticides and 91 nonexposed. Farmers had significantly increased NPB (nuclear plasmatic bridge), MN (micronucleus) and NBUD (nuclear bud) frequencies, as well as IL-6 (interleukin 6) and TNF-\u03b1 (tumor necrosis factor alpha) serum levels, and decreased cytokines CD4+/CD8+ ratio. In the exposed group, XRCC1 Trp/- was correlated with decreased NDI (nuclear division index), and OGG1 Cys/- was associated with higher levels of NPB and decreased levels of IL-6. The combined effects of PON1 Arg/- and XRCC1 Arg/Arg were associated with increased NPB frequencies. In addition, the combination of PON1 Arg/- with XRCC1 Trp/- or OGG1 Cys/- influenced in increased levels of necrosis in farmers. Furthermore, tobacco farmers showed a positive correlation between TNF-\u03b1 levels and NPB, CD4+/CD8+ ratio and NBUD; and IL-6 levels with both MN and NDI. The duration of years of work at tobacco fields was correlated positively with NBUD frequency. Sulfur, chlorine and potassium were found at increased levels in the exposed group when compared to the nonexposed one. These findings provide evidence that tobacco farmers\u2019 exposure have increased DNA damage and alter the immune system\u2019s response, and that XRCC1 and OGG1 polymorphisms could influence both biomarkers results.",

     "abstract": "Cateura landfill located in Asunci\u00f3n-Paraguay is the site of final disposal of tons of garbage of all kinds coming from urban, industrial and commercial areas. Due to an inadequate waste management system, there is a big concern in our country on how it can affect people working within the landfill as waste pickers. When a high risk of exposure affecting workers in their work places is supposed, defining biomarkers of genotoxic damage is obligatory. The principal aim of this study was to evaluate the genetic damage in occupationally exposed women in their work environments through two established biomarkers: the single-cell gel electrophoresis assay (SCGE) accomplished in peripheral blood and the micronucleus test performed in exfoliated cells from oral mucosa (BMCyT). This is an analytical observational cohort study involving 50 women occupationally exposed and 34 unexposed women. A statistically significant increase (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) in the parameters to measure genotoxicity was observed in the garbage recyclers of the landfill, compared to the control group. The frequency of Micronuclei (MN) and other nuclear abnormalities such as karyolytic and karyorrhectic cells were higher in exposed women. In addition, significant differences in the % of DNA in the tail of comets between exposed and control groups were found. Our results suggest that the increase in DNA damage and nuclear alterations found in exposed-waste pickers women can be explained as a result to their direct contact with chemicals, many of them identified as genotoxic and other alleged mutagens. This chronic exposure could be diminished by using safety procedures and suitable personal protective equipment inside the workplace. The burden of morbidity due to occupational exposure to genotoxic agents in this place is unknown, therefore, these types of studies should be addressed in order to advice to authorities on social policies of protection of landfills workers.",

Nevertheless, the understanding of this mechanism is still incomplete, particularly in regard to environmental exposures. This study aimed to evaluate DNA damage using the cytome assay (BMN-cyt) in buccal cells and its relation to primary and oxidative DNA damage in lymphocytes, assessed by the high-throughput alkaline and modified (FPG-ENDO III) Comet assay in individuals with environmental exposure to coal mining residues in northern Colombia. Considering metals from coal mining activities as the main source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, the concentrations of inorganic elements in blood samples was also assessed. The analysis revealed that frequencies of BMN-cyt parameters related to DNA damage (micronuclei), cytokinesis (binucleated cells) and cell death (condensed chromatin, karyorrhexis, pyknosis and karyolysis) were significantly higher in individuals that were environmentally exposed to coal compared to the unexposed group. The level of % Tail DNA in the alkaline and the modified Comet assay was 4.0 and 4.3 times higher among exposed individuals than in unexposed controls respectively. Increased MN frequencies in buccal cells were correlated with increased %Tail DNA in alkaline and FPG Comet assay. Additionally, exposed individuals had higher concentrations of Cr, Ni, Mn, and Br in the blood compared to unexposed controls. %Tail DNA in alkaline Comet assay was highly correlated with Al, Mn, and Br concentrations, while %Tail DNA in the FPG Comet assay correlated with Mn levels. These results suggest that oxidative damage, particularly purine oxidation, may play an essential role in DNA damage in individuals exposed to coal residues and that some inorganic elements are related to this effect.",

Pneumoconiosis, fibrosis, asbestosis, silicosis, emphysema, loss of lung function and cancer are some examples of coal-related disorders. The aim of this study was to analyze coal miners with respect to telomere length (TL) and percentage (%) of global DNA methylation. The study involved 82 participants divided into two groups: 55 workers exposed to coal and 27 non-exposed individuals. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples from all individuals. Telomeres were measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and global DNA methylation levels were performed by the relative quantitation of 5-methyl-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-mdC) by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). TL measurements showed a mean of 9,199\u202fbp (\u00b14,196) for non-exposed and 7,545\u202fbp (\u00b12,703) for exposed groups, and% of global DNA methylation a mean of 2.78% (\u00b10.41) for non-exposed and 3.00% (\u00b10.37) for exposed individuals. Occupationally exposed individuals showed a significant decrease of TL (P\u202f<\u202f0.05; Mann-Whitney test) and increase in the percentage of global DNA methylation (P\u202f<\u202f0.05; Mann-Whitney test) when compared to the non-exposed group. This study showed that occupational exposure to coal and products of combustion is positively associated with TL and DNA methylation. Previously, we have evaluated the same individuals using comet assay, micronucleus (MN) test, oxidative stress and inorganic elements. No correlations were observed between TL and methylation with previous data in the exposed group. Further studies are needed to determine whether these alterations are associated with induced disease outcomes and if these events could be determinants to identify cancer risk.",

Aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of polymorphisms of glutathione (GSH)-genes related to the antioxidant status and Pb metabolism (GCLC, rs17883901 and GCLM, rs41303970) on Pb levels in blood (B-Pb) and plasma (P-Pb), as well as Pb-related effects on activity of glutathione-peroxidase (GPX) and on GSH concentrations. A cross-sectional study with 236 adults (men,\u2009>18\u202fyears old) was carried out with workers from automotive battery factories, Brazil. B-Pb and P-Pb were determined by ICP-MS; blood GPX and GSH were determined by spectrophotometry and qPCR TaqMan assays were used for genotyping. A questionnaire was applied in order to collect socio-demographic, lifestyle and time of exposure. The mean B-Pb level was 211\u202f\u00b1\u202f118\u202f\u03bcg/L and P-Pb was 6.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.13\u202f\u03bcg/L. GCLM are associated with changes of B-Pb and P-Pb; individuals who carry at least one polymorphic allele for GCLM gene had lower metal levels in the blood and plasma (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22121.5; p\u202f=\u202f0.0080; \u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.12 and p\u202f=\u202f0.050).

In turn, V79 cells were treated with a concentration range of 15\u20132000\u202f\u03bcg/mL NiO NPs. The SMART showed that all concentrations of NiO NPs are genotoxic to the standart (ST) cross when compared to the negative control.

However, some authors have postulated that they might bring about toxic effects. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the effects of chronic administration of Diplotaxis tenuifolia (wild rocket), a species found in Argentina, concerning its putative genotoxicity or antigenotoxicity against the DNA damage inducer cyclophosphamide, and its ability to modulate the hepatic expression of ABC efflux transporters on mice. The alkaline comet assay and the micronucleus test were used as genotoxicity biomarkers, and the ABC transporter expression was analyzed by Western-blotting. D. tenuifolia juice exhibited no genotoxicity in any of the three tested doses (p\u202f>\u202f0.05), showing instead a protective effect against genotoxic damage induced by cyclophosphamide (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) in a dose-dependent behavior.

The modulation of these transporters may contribute to the antigenotoxic effects of D. tenuifolia since they act as universal detoxifiers, excreting xenobiotics to the cellular exterior. Phytochemicals present in the juice such as glucosinolates, quercetin and kaempherol may be responsible for these beneficial effects.",

     "abstract": "Radiotherapy is widely used for cancer treatment. However, its adverse effects that may develop during the course of treatment have forced to search agents to protect biological systems against the deleterious effects of radiation. Resveratrol (3,4,5-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene; RSV) is a natural polyphenol currently promoted for its beneficial pleiotropic effects on health, which has been shown to exhibit antioxidant properties while inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. In radioresistant tumors, RSV could contribute to reduce recurrence and treatment failure. We evaluated the radiomodulatory and genotoxic effects of RSV in CHO-k1 and A549 cell lines and in peripheral human blood lymphocytes through both conventional and hypofractionated protocols, due to the widespread use of hypofractionation in recent years. RSV genotoxic and cytotoxic action was assessed at 15 and 60\u202f\u03bcM concentrations with the comet and the MTT assay and in cell proliferation experiments. Our results show that RSV administration to tumor cells at a dose of 60\u202f\u03bcM exerted a genotoxic effect and that this concentration also had the capacity of modulating the cytomolecular damage induced by 4 and 16\u202fGy. These doses are delivered in conventional and hypofractionated radiotherapy, respectively. In both treatments, a radiosensitizing effect was evidenced by the decrease in cell viability that was exacerbated over time. These effects were not found in peripheral blood, suggesting that RSV had a dual response. Although the results obtained in CHO-k1 transformed cells corroborated the genotoxic effect of the 60\u202f\u03bcM dose of RSV observed in the tumor system, they also showed a radio-protective effect at the lowest dose (15\u202f\u03bcM). While more studies are necessary, our results together with the good systemic tolerance of RSV and the lack of toxicity position the compound as a potential candidate for the prevention and treatment of cancer as well as for the optimization of the radiotherapeutic ratio.",

Radiotherapy (RT) is one of the most frequently used treatments for cancer aimed at eliminating tumor cells. However, it can also alter the surrounding normal tissue, especially the skin, and patient reactions may vary as a result of extrinsic and intrinsic factors. We evaluated the association of gene polymorphisms ATM Asp1853Asn, IL-6 G-174C and TNF-\u03b1 G-308A involved in central phenotype pathways and development of individual radiosensitivity in BC patients with an exacerbated response to RT. Although univariate analysis results did not show a significant association with this trait, the interaction analysis between polymorphisms showed an increased risk of patients presenting wild-type TNF-\u03b1 G-308A genotype and mutant IL-6 G-174C genotype, and heterozygous TNF-\u03b1 G-308A genotype and heterozygous IL-6G-174C genotype. On the other hand, our results showed that breast size and patient age influenced the determination of RT-associated effects. Considering that the trait is multifactorial, other significant elements for the determination of individual radiosensitivity should be considered, together with the establishment of specific polymorphic variants.",

     "abstract": "Several findings suggest that in utero stressor stimuli can alter fetal development by promoting transcriptional changes, and predisposing the neonate to diseases later in life. This study aimed to investigate whether a hyperglycemic environment in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is able to cause fetal genetic alterations and predispose neonates to obesity. Transcriptional alteration of SIRT1, TP53 and BCL2 genes, miR-181a (a SIRT1 or BCL2 regulator) and telomere length were evaluated in placental and umbilical-cord blood cells. Healthy (HP; n\u202f=\u202f20) and GDM (n\u202f=\u202f20) pregnant women and their respective neonates were included in the study. Additionally, obese (n\u202f=\u202f20) and eutrophic (n\u202f=\u202f20) adults also participated as reference populations. Gene expression data showed down-regulation of BCL2 in umbilical-cord and peripheral blood cells from GDM neonates and obese adults, respectively. The miR-181a was down-regulated only in umbilical-cord blood cells of GDM neonates. Telomere length presented no significant difference. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the GDM hyperglycemic intrauterine environment promotes transcriptional alterations in BCL2 and miR-181a in neonate umbilical-cord blood cells. Furthermore, both GDM neonates and obese subjects share the same transcriptional alteration in BCL2. Considering the relationship between obesity development and the functions regulated by these two genes, BCL2 and miR-181a could be adopted as potential biomarkers for childhood obesity. However, further study designs are recommended to confirm this hypothesis.",

     "abstract": "The immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA), derived from the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), is a drug used widely by kidney transplant recipients. This drug selectively inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase that controls the proliferation of lymphocytes, aiding in the prevention of rejection of the transplanted organ. Polymorphisms in key genes involved in MMF metabolism may alter the function of the enzymes encoded by them and contribute to interindividual variability in the response to the drug and its efficacy. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of nine polymorphic variants of eight genes involved in MMF pharmacokinetics, with rejection and adverse effects exhibited by kidney transplant recipients who use this drug. Our sample comprised 145 kidney transplant recipients undergoing post-transplant treatment whose immunosuppressive therapy consisted of MMF and corticosteroid combined or not with a calcineurin inhibitor or mTOR inhibitor. The average age of the patients was 46.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.5 years, and they underwent transplantation 7\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.71 years ago. The combination of the T/C and C/C genotypes of the polymorphism rs11706052 (IMPDH2) was associated with a 4.2-fold protection, and the combination of the genotypes A/G and G/G of the polymorphism rs7438135 (UGT2B7) showed a 2.4-fold protection, against rejection. The association of T/C and C/C genotypes in the SNP rs11706052 (IMPDH2) with the occurrence of rejection episodes considering only patients who received immunosuppressive drug MMF associated with cyclosporine or tacrolimus and corticoids, demonstrated association with a protection against rejection 15.6-fold. The T/T genotype of the polymorphism rs2241409 (CES2) was associated with a 7.2-fold increased risk of rejection. Therefore, these polymorphisms that showed a strong association with rejection episodes should be considered in future studies on new prognostic markers for rejection in patients treated with MMF.",

     "abstract": "The mTOR pathway and the enzyme telomerase are two key players commonly upregulated in cancers. They render survival and proliferative advantage to cancer cells, and are regarded as attractive anticancer targets. Rapamycin, a macrolide antibiotic and mTOR inhibitor, has recently also been implicated in telomerase inhibition and telomere attrition, although the mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) wherein telomerase activity and mTOR pathway are concurrently overexpressed, this study sought to unravel novel mechanisms by which rapamycin may affect these pathways. Short term treatment with an acute dose of rapamycin inhibited the mTOR pathway and telomerase activity and induced G1 arrest. This arrest was independent of cyclin D1 and p21 levels and was not mediated by DNA damage in both cell types. While long term treatment with a clinically relevant dose of rapamycin resulted in compromised population doubling capacity and mTOR pathway inhibition, there was no effect on telomere functionality and telomerase activity as evidenced by our assessments of hTERT protein levels, in vitro telomerase activity, telomere length and telomere FISH analyses. We also found that sustained rapamycin treatment leading to Akt activation may play a role in resistance in the more invasive MDA-MB-231 cells. In summary, rapamycin specifically inhibits the activation of mTOR pathway. Moreover, we show for the first time that while acute short-term treatment with rapamycin induces telomerase inhibition, it does not affect telomerase activity nor does it inflict telomere dysfunction in breast cancer cells upon chronic long-term treatment with a clinically relevant dose. These findings may be useful while designing combinatorial treatment strategies with rapamycin inhibition in the clinic.",

     "abstract": "DNA damage response (DDR) constitutes a protein pathway to handle eukaryotic DNA lesions in the context of chromatin. DDR engages the recruitment of signaling, transducer, effector, chromatin modifiers and remodeling proteins, allowing cell cycle delay, DNA repair or induction of senescence or apoptosis. An early DDR-event includes the epigenetic phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX on serine 139 of the C-termini, so-called gammaH2AX. GammaH2AX foci detected by immunolabeling on interphase nuclei have been largely studied; nonetheless gammaH2AX signals on mitotic chromosomes are less understood. The CHO9 cell line is a subclone of CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells with original and rearranged Z chromosomes originated during cell line transformation. As a result, homologous chromosome regions have been relocated in different Z-chromosomes. In a first quantitative analysis of gammaH2AX signals on immunolabeled mitotic chromosomes of cytocentrifuged metaphase spreads, we reported that gammaH2AX139 signals of both control and bleomycin-exposed cultures showed statistically equal distribution between CHO9 homologous chromosome regions, suggesting a possible dependence on the structure/function of chromatin. We have also demonstrated that bleomycin-induced gammaH2AX foci map preferentially to DNA replicating domains in CHO9 interphase nuclei. With the aim of understanding the role of gammaH2AX signals on metaphase chromosomes, the relation between 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) labeled replicating chromosome regions and gammaH2AX signals in immunolabeled cytocentrifuged metaphase spreads from control and bleomycin-treated CHO9 cultures was analyzed in the present work. A quantitative analysis of colocalization between EdU and gammaH2AX signals based on the calculation of the Replication Related Damage Distribution Index (RDDI) on confocal metaphase images was performed. RDDI revealed a colocalization between EdU and gammaH2AX signals both in control and bleomycin-treated CHO9 metaphases, suggesting that replication may be involved in H2AX phosphorylation. The possible mechanisms implicated are discussed.",

Homozygous individuals have a variety of pathological manifestations, however, heterozygotes only present a higher risk of developing cancer. We evaluated the background levels of DNA damage (basal damage) and cell response to bleomycin or ionizing radiation using Comet assay and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) test in individuals with AT, their parents and controls. To evaluate DNA repair, the challenge experiment with ionizing radiation was performed using Comet assay, and different recovery times were evaluated. Results showed that basal MN frequencies differ between patients, parents and controls. Meanwhile, using the Comet assay, the results from the basal analysis do not differ between the groups, but monitoring the kinetics of DNA repair, we verified that the group of patients showed a delay in repair, compared to controls. Another finding was the nuclear bud (NBUD) frequency: spontaneous and induced cell cultures (with bleomycin and radiation) showed clear differences between patients, parents and controls. The CBMN assay and repair measurement with the Comet assay can help in the diagnosis of AT patients and ATM gene carriers, as complementary methods. The use of genomic instability evaluation techniques for the identification of the heterozygotes in families, where at least one member is affected, may be of great clinical importance.",

     "abstract": "During DNA replication, forks may encounter unrepaired lesions that hamper DNA synthesis. Cells have universal strategies to promote damage bypass allowing cells to survive. DNA damage tolerance can be performed upon template switch or by specialized DNA polymerases, known as translesion (TLS) polymerases. Human cells count on more than eleven TLS polymerases and this work reviews the functions of some of these enzymes: Rev1, Pol \u03b7, Pol \u03b9, Pol \u03ba, Pol \u03b8 and Pol \u03b6. The mechanisms of damage bypass vary according to the lesion, as well as to the TLS polymerases available, and may occur directly at the fork during replication. Alternatively, the lesion may be skipped, leaving a single-stranded DNA gap that will be replicated later. Details of the participation of these enzymes are revised for the replication of damaged template. TLS polymerases also have functions in other cellular processes. These include involvement in somatic hypermutation in immunoglobulin genes, direct participation in recombination and repair processes, and contributing to replicating noncanonical DNA structures. The importance of DNA damage replication to cell survival is supported by recent discoveries that certain genes encoding TLS polymerases are induced in response to DNA damaging agents, protecting cells from a subsequent challenge to DNA replication. We retrace the findings on these genotoxic (adaptive) responses of human cells and show the common aspects with the SOS responses in bacteria. Paradoxically, although TLS of DNA damage is normally an error prone mechanism, in general it protects from carcinogenesis, as evidenced by increased tumorigenesis in xeroderma pigmentosum variant patients, who are deficient in Pol \u03b7. As these TLS polymerases also promote cell survival, they constitute an important mechanism by which cancer cells acquire resistance to genotoxic chemotherapy. Therefore, the TLS polymerases are new potential targets for improving therapy against tumors.",

     "abstract": "Human malignancies are often hallmarked with genomic instability, which itself is also considered a causative event in malignant transformation. Genomic instability may manifest itself as genetic changes in the nucleotide sequence of DNA, or as structural or numerical changes of chromosomes. Unrepaired or insufficiently repaired DNA double-strand breaks, as well as telomere shortening, are important contributors in the formation of structural chromosomal aberrations (CAs). In the present review, we discuss potential mechanisms behind the formation of CAs and their relation to cancer. Based on our own studies, we also illustrate how inherited genetic variation may modify the frequency and types of CAs occurring in humans. Recently, we published a series of studies on variations in genes relevant to maintaining genomic integrity, such as those encoding xenobiotic-metabolising enzymes, DNA repair, the tumour suppressor TP53, the spindle assembly checkpoint, and cyclin D1 (CCND1). While individually genetic variation in these genes exerted small modulating effects, in interactions they were associated with CA frequencies in peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy volunteers. Moreover, we observed opposite associations between the CCND1 splice site polymorphism rs9344 G870A and the frequency of CAs compared to their association with translocation t(11,14). We discuss the functional consequences of the CCND1 gene in interplay with DNA damage response and DNA repair during malignant transformation.Our review summarizes existing evidence that gene variations in relevant cellular pathways modulate the frequency of CAs, predominantly in a complex interaction. More functional/mechanistic studies elucidating these observations are required. Several questions emerge, such as the role of CAs in malignancies with respect to a particular phenotype and heterogeneity, the formation of CAs during the process of malignant transformation, and the formation of CAs in individual types of lymphocytes in relation to the immune response.",

In that context, we discuss advantages and disadvantages of more modern methods used to measure intrachanges, and the implications that their increased resolution of measurement may have on the inter-to-intrachange fraction (i.e., the F-ratio). We conclude that the premise of the F-ratio is supported by its biophysical assumptions, but its intended use as an LET-dependent measure of prior radiation exposure is hampered mainly by our inability to accurately assess, on a cell-by-cell basis, inversions and interstitial deletions whose small sizes are below the detection limits of conventional cytogenetic techniques.",

Micronuclei (MN) frequency was determined in peripheral blood lymphocytes at both basal level, and after challenging the cells with 0.5\u202fGy of ionizing radiation. The following polymorphisms: GSTP1 (rs749174), GSTO1 (rs2164624), and GSTO2 (rs156697) were evaluated in the two groups. Results indicate that gene variants were distributed differentially between CKD patients and controls. Although GSTO1 and GSTO2 variants were associated with lower levels of MN, this was observed in both CKD patients and controls. When net MN values were determined after irradiation, GSTO1 and GSTO2 variants were also associated with lower MN-frequencies. On the contrary, individuals with the GSTP1 variant showed higher values of induced MN. In conclusion, we have demonstrate that the selected GST polymorphism play a role in the incidence of CKD, and affects the levels of MN.

     "abstract": "Recently fourteen systematic reviews applying the same selection and evaluation criteria analyzed the induction of micronuclei in lymphocytes as biomarker for DNA damage induced by human exposure to a given chemical or chemical mixture. The results obtained in the individual reviews were summarized to evaluate the validity of the Cytokinesis-Block-Micronucleus assay in lymphocytes (L-CBMN) and propose recommendations for its use in occupational and environmental exposure studies. All systematic reviews found consistent increases of MN frequencies in exposed subjects versus controls in all genotoxic compounds or group of chemicals investigated, in the following decreasing order: As/Cr/Ni, vinyl chloride, formaldehyde, Hg/Pb/Cd, \u201cmiscellaneous\u201d, pesticides, cytostatics/antineoplastics, anaesthetic gasses, dust/asbestos/other fibers, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, ethylene oxide, butadiene, styrene and petroleum/derivatives. Two reviews compared the results with the recommended exposure limits. For styrene, MN was found not to be induced under the recommended threshold limit. For vinyl chloride the safe exposure limit based on the L-CBMN data is lower than the current one. The L-CBMN thus appears to be a valid biomarker to assess DNA damage in populations exposed to genotoxic chemicals. Many shortcomings have been reported in assessment of confounding factors, such as lifestyle patterns, in particular diet and the major one the exposure assessment. All these factors together with methodological variables may contribute to the large variability in MN frequencies, also in controls. Information on frequency and origin of MN in more than one tissue (e.g. lymphocytes and buccal cells) in parallel, may provide better understanding of the mechanisms involved. Use of automated MN scoring systems to increase numbers of cells scored and facilitate screening more individuals would increase data reliability and provide information on the link between mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, if the studies are done prospectively.

     "abstract": "The lymphocyte Cytokinesis-Block Micronucleus (CBMN) assay was originally developed for the measurement of micronuclei (MN) exclusively in binucleated (BN) cells, which represent the population of cells that can express MN because they completed nuclear division. Recently the assay has evolved into a comprehensive cytome method to include biomarkers that measure chromosomal instability and cytotoxicity by quantification of nuclear buds (NBUDs), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and apoptotic/necrotic cells. Furthermore, enumeration of mono- and polynucleated cells allows for computation of the nuclear division index (NDI) to assess mitotic activity. Typically performed by manual microscopy, the CBMN cytome assay is laborious and subject to scorer bias and fatigue, leading to inter- and intra-scorer variability. Automated microscopy and conventional flow cytometry methods have been developed to automate scoring of the traditional and cytome versions of the assay. However, these methods have several limitations including the requirement to create high-quality microscope slides, lack of staining consistency and sub-optimal nuclear/cytoplasmic visualization. In the case of flow cytometry, stripping of the cytoplasmic membrane makes it impossible to measure MN in BN cells, calculate the NDI or to quantify apoptotic or necrotic cells. Moreover, the absence of cellular visualization using conventional flow cytometry, makes it impossible to quantify NBUDs and NPBs. In this review, we propose that imaging flow cytometry (IFC), which combines high resolution microscopy with flow cytometry, may overcome these limitations. We demonstrate that by using IFC, images from cells in suspension can be captured, removing the need for microscope slides and allowing visualization of intact cytoplasmic membranes and DNA content. Thus, mono-, bi- and polynucleated cells with and without MN can be rapidly and automatically identified and quantified. Finally, we present high-resolution cell images containing NBUDs and NPBs, illustrating that IFC possesses the potential for completely automated scoring of all components of the CBMN cytome assay.",

In this work, the applicability of cell-fusion-mediated premature chromosome condensation (PCC) in G0-lymphocytes is examined for the development of a rapid, minimally invasive and automatable micro-PCC assay, which requires blood volumes of only 100\u202f\u03bcl and can be performed in 96-well plates, towards risk assessments and categorization of individuals based on dose estimates. Chromosomal aberrations are visualized for dose-estimation analysis within two hours, without the need of blood culturing for two days, as required by conventional cytogenetics. The various steps of the standard-PCC procedure were adapted and, for the first time, lymphocytes in blood volumes of 100\u202f\u03bcl were successfully fused with CHO-mitotics in 96-well plates of 2\u202fml/well. The plates are advantageous for high-throughput analysis since the various steps required are applied to all 96-wells simultaneously. Interestingly, the use of only 1.5\u202fml hypotonic and Carnoy\u2019s fixative per well offers high quality PCC-images, and the morphology of lymphocyte PCCs is identical to that obtained using the conventional PCC-assay, which requires much larger blood volumes and 15\u202fml tubes. For dose assessments, appropriate calibration curves were constructed and for PCC analysis specialized software (MetaSystems) was used. The micro-PCC assay can be combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using simultaneously centromeric/telomeric (C/T) peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probes. This allows dose assessments on the basis of accurate scoring of dicentric and centric ring chromosomes in G0-lymphocyte PCCs, which is particularly helpful when further evaluation into treatment-level categories of exposed individuals is needed. The micro-PCC assay has significant advantages for early triage biodosimetry when compared to other cytogenetic biodosimetry assays. It is rapid, cost-effective, and could pave the way to its subsequent automation.",

     "abstract": "Human exposure to ionizing radiation has increased over time, mainly due to medical applications, occupational and environmental exposure, as well as accidents involving radioactive materials. In September 1987, an accident with 137Cesium occurred in Goi\u00e2nia city, Brazil; the accident started with the removal of a 50.9-TBq 137Cesium source from an abandoned radiotherapy unit. Among the radiation-exposed victims, at least 50 individuals showed symptoms of whole-body and local acute irradiation, and also external or internal contamination. In this report, the purpose was to review and summarize the main results of cytogenetic studies carried out with victims of 137Cesium, for blood collection performed shortly after the accident, and following several years post-exposure. The importance of dose estimates by biological dosimetry is highlighted, and also several lessons that were learned from the initial to follow-up (7\u201310\u202fyears after the accident) studies, mainly by applying the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) method. A relevant aspect discussed on the basis of the results obtained in those studies refers to the incidence of chromosomal translocations, which were directly compared to the initial frequencies of dicentrics that were previously used to estimate the absorbed doses. In general, translocation frequencies were two to three times lower than the dicentric frequencies, and the differences were dose-dependent. Furthermore, regarding attempts to perform retrospective dosimetry (10 years post-accident), the dose estimates using translocation frequencies for victims of 137Cesium indicate the feasibility of this approach only for low level exposure (below 0.5\u202fGy), while for higher doses there are some limitations, and the requirement to apply appropriate correction factors, which were discussed on the basis of literature data. Apart of this, in general terms, important aspects to be mentioned refer to the need for better care and control of radioactive devices, as well as adequate education programs for professionals and also the population.",

Furthermore, no overall changes of the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma were detected. However, we found in agreement with earlier investigations a moderate (not significant) increase of the CRP levels with age. Furthermore, significant higher CRP concentrations (P\u202f=\u202f0.03) were detected in young individuals (21\u201330 years) as a consequence of the extended working period.

A thorough health checkup and complete haematogram of the study participants was performed to measure overall health effects and changes in the blood profile in children exposed to arsenic through drinking water in West Bengal, India. Since telomere length alteration has been identified as a good indicator of arsenic toxicity in adults, we measured the telomere length of the arsenic exposed and unexposed children. We found that all the three cell types had significantly higher (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001) MN frequency in the arsenic exposed children when compared to the unexposed. Blood profiling showed significantly altered neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte and haemoglobin levels in the arsenic exposed children than their unexposed counterparts.

     "abstract": "There is an intricate balance of DNA damage response and repair which determines the homeostasis of human genome function. p53 protein is widely known for its role in cell cycle regulation and tumor suppressor activity. In case of several cancers where function of p53 gene gets compromised either by mutation or partial inactivation, the role of p53 in response to DNA damage needs to be supplemented by another molecule or pathway. Due to sedentary lifestyle and exposure to genotoxic agents, genome is predisposed to chronic stress, which ultimately leads to unrepaired or background DNA damage. p38 MAPK signaling pathway is strongly activated in response to various environmental and cellular stresses. DNA damage response and the repair options have crucial links with chromosomal integrity. Telomere that regulates integrity of genome is protected by a six member shielding unit called shelterin complex which communicates with other pathways for functionality of telomeres. There are evidences that p38 gets activated through ATM in response to DNA damage. Dysfunctional telomere leads to activation of ATM which subsequently activates p38 suggesting a crosstalk between p38, ATM and shelterin complex. This review focuses on activation of p38 in response to genotoxic stress induced DNA damage in p53 mutated or compromised state and its possible cross talk with telomere shelterin proteins. Thus p38 may act as an important target to treat various diseases and in majority of cancers in p53 mutated state.",

Cytogenetic studies included chromosomal aberration (CA) assays and cytokinesis block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assays. In DS, MCA and AA, average frequencies of nuclear anomalies (NA) were 0.015\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.0006, 0.021\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.00123, 0.031\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.00098, respectively and CA were 0.107\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.003, 0.105\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.008, 0.158\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.006, respectively per metaphase.

However, these advances have not gone in parallel with the development of medical treatments, with the exception of improved protocols of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). BMF and hematological malignancies are the most important and life threatening conditions the patient suffer during the first and second decade of life, respectively, being HSCT the only curative treatment available. Solid tumors are the third hallmark of the disease, usually with poor prognosis as tumor resection is the only therapeutic option given that patients do not tolerate chemotherapy or radiation. With improved HSCT protocols, FA patient survival has increased, leading to a progressively increased number of solid malignancies in adult patients. Therapeutic research is currently focused in targeted therapies for solid tumors as well as in preventive options in the context of drug repurposing. This review summarizes current therapies and drugs used so far in clinical trials to treat Fanconi anemia, as well as the ones used in FA research with potential for future therapeutic opportunities including drugs that suppress chromosome fragility or are expected to delay the onset of BMF and cancer in Fanconi anemia.",

     "abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia is a rare autosomal recessive genome instability syndrome caused by mutations in the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated gene and characterized by a very high sensitivity to agents inducing double strand breaks such as ionizing radiation. In cells derived from ataxia telangiectasia patients a prominent enhancement of chromosomal aberrations is revealed as a consequence of this radiosensitivity characteristic, arising from defective DNA repair for a small fraction of breaks localized in the less accessible heterochromatin. Moreover, the signaling mediated by ataxia telangiectasia protein kinase also modifies chromatin structure. Even if there is a lot of knowledge concerning biochemical aspects of repair of double strand breaks, no conclusive results on radiosensitivity of structurally- and functionally-different chromatin are available, particularly in ataxia telangiectasia cells. Thus, a wild-type cell line and two ataxia telangiectasia patient derived ones could represent a suitable model to study the possible relationship between chromatin conformation and sensitivity to ionizing radiation. In this context, the effects of both cytosine arabinoside, an inhibitor of DNA repair synthesis, and trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, were tested in normal and ataxia telangiectasia lymphoblastoid cell lines carrying different mutation in the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated gene. The response to both inhibitors was investigated analyzing two endpoints, namely, chromosomal aberrations and the removal of DNA lesions by Comet assay, after exposure to X-rays. Results obtained suggest that the modulation of chromatin structure by trichostatin A leading to a more open conformation, decreases radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations in ataxia telangiectasia cells. The reduction in chromosomal instability can be attributed to an enhancement in DNA repair occurring in the presence of the histone deacetylase inhibitor, as its abolishment by the known inhibitor of DNA repair synthesis cytosine arabinoside clearly demonstrates. Data obtained could indicate a pivotal role of chromatin conformation in the radiosensitivity of ataxia telangiectasia cells.",

Apart from playing its major role in regulating the cellular response to DNA damage, ATM, when mutated, can additionally determine oxidative stress, metabolic syndrome, mitochondrial dysfunction and neurodegeneration.In the present paper we aim to investigate the levels of oxidative stress potentially induced by the oxidizing rodent renal carcinogen KBrO3 in ATM-defective lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from four classical AT patients (with different ATM mutations), one AT variant with reduced hypersensitivity to X rays, obligate AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control. A possible modulatory involvement of PARP in potentially induced oxidative stress is also evaluated following its inhibition with 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB).Treatments with KBrO3 clearly showed a marked hypersensitivity of the ATM-defective LCLs, including the AT variant. A marked and statistically significant reduction of KBrO3-induced chromosomal damage following inhibition of PARP by 3-AB, was observed in all AT LCLs, but not in those from the AT variant, AT heterozygotes and wild type intrafamilial control. This result is suggestive of a modulatory involvement of PARP in the hypersensitivity of ATM-defective cells to DNA oxidative damage.",

     "abstract": "In mammalian cells, nucleotide excision repair system is constituted of two sub-pathways, global genomic repair (GGR) and transcription coupled repair (TCR). Deficiency of TCR pathway leads to Cockyane syndrome (CS) which is a rare human autosomal recessive disorder. Owing to the pivotal role of CSB gene in TCR, it\u2019s mutation causes severe repair and transcriptional defects in CSB patients. CSB protein belongs to the ATP chromatin remodeling complex, hence presumably an improper chromatin remodeling in CSB cells could be at the source of inefficient removal of pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) after UVC exposure in these patients. In this study, we evaluated the role of chromatin remodeling process on UVC induced CPDs and the ensuing effect on chromosomal aberrations in UV61 cells (TCR deficient) and its parental cell line, AA8 (TCR proficient). We observed that post 2\u2009h UVC irradiation, both cell lines underwent pronounced chromatin relaxation but was lower in CSB deficient UV61 cells. Since the deficiency in chromatin remodeling in CSB-mutated cells was accompanied by a decrease in the histone acetylation level, the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) was employed to improve the removal of UVC-induced lesions by increasing the histone acetylation level. Contrary to expectations, TSA increased the induction of chromosomal aberrations and apoptotic cells along with amounts of CPDs after UVC-irradiation, indicating that changes in histone acetylation levels might contribute to the failure in the removal of UVC-induced lesions. Also, it has been shown earlier that the expression of genes regulated by CSB is affected by the increase in the acetylation level produced by TSA. Taken all together, we hypothesize that failure in the removal of UVC induced lesions in CSB-deficient cells can be caused by an imbalance in histone acetylation levels leading to chromatin conformation changes and hence interaction defects among repair proteins and DNA lesions.",

The animals exhibited glucose intolerance, reduced general adiposity, and increased maternal and offspring organ weight, showing the benefit of exercise for these rats. We hypothesised that regular exercise in SPA during gestation could prevent DNA damage in these animals and in their offspring, contributing to altered fetal programming of metabolism in the offspring. Severe diabetes was induced by streptozotocin treatment, to obtain SPA newborns. At adulthood, pregnant SPA rats were randomly distributed into two groups: exercised (SPAex \u2013 submitted to swimming program) or not-exercised (SPA \u2013 sedentary rats). Post-partum, blood was collected for analysis of DNA damage (comet assay) and oxidative stress. SPAex rats presented lower DNA damage levels, decreased lipid peroxidation, and a lower rate of newborns classified as large-for-pregnancy-age. DNA damage was also lower in SPAex newborns.

We observed that the alkylating agent methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) can result in HML\u03b1 expression, using a colony sector assay that results from expression of a HML-positioned cre gene. Using single-cell imaging we also observed that alkylating agents, including MMS and methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), as well as short-wave UV, also decreased HML silencing. We suggest that chemical-induced alterations in heterochromatin structure could confer transient phenotypic changes that affect the cellular responses to DNA damaging agents.",

Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) can reduce GAG storage, ameliorate symptoms, and slow disease progression. Oxidative damages may contribute to the MPS II pathophysiology, and treatment with ERT might reduce the effects of oxidative stress. We evaluated levels of DNA damage (including oxidative damage) and chromosome damage in leukocytes of long-term-treated MPS II patients, by applying the buccal micronucleus cytome assay. We observed that, despite long-term ERT, MPS II patients had higher levels of DNA damage and higher frequencies of micronuclei and nuclear buds than did control. These genetic damages are presumably due to oxidation: we also observed increased levels of oxidized guanine species in MPS II patients. Therapy adjuvant to ERT should be considered, in order to decrease oxidative damage and cytogenetic alterations.",

Since the early 1980\u2019s 1,4-NQ has been tested in a number of genotoxicity assays, both in vitro and in vivo. There is strong evidence that 1,4-NQ does not induce gene mutations in bacteria or mammalian cells in vitro with predominantly negative Ames tests and negative Hprt and tk mutation studies. However, there is clear evidence of a clastogenic response in vitro from positive micronucleus, sister chromatid exchange and chromosome aberration assays. 1,4-NQ-treated mice and hamsters were, however, negative for micronucleus or chromosomal aberration induction in GLP-compliant studies with clear evidence of target tissue exposure, suggesting an in vitro only effect. Evidence indicates that the mechanism of in vitro clastogenicity is predominantly via ROS generation, and since in vitro mammalian cell tests systems have poor anti-oxidant defence mechanisms, they are particularly sensitive to oxidative DNA damage. On the other hand, healthy mammalian tissues have more efficient anti-oxidant defence mechanisms, and therefore it is not surprising that 1,4-NQ is not genotoxic in vivo.",

Genetic toxicity and DNA alkylation effects of SM in molecular and animal experiments are well documented. In this study, lymphocytic telomere lengths and serum levels of isoprostane F2\u03b1 were measured using q-PCR and enzyme immunoassay-based methods in 40 Iranian veterans who had been exposed to SM between 1983-88 and 40 non-exposed healthy volunteers. The relative telomere length in SM-exposed individuals was found to be significantly shorter than the non-exposed individuals. In addition, the level of 8-isoprostane F2\u03b1 was significantly higher in the SM-exposed group compared to controls. Oxidative stress can be caused by defective antioxidant responses following gene mutations or altered activities of antioxidant enzymes. Chronic respiratory diseases and infections may also increaseoxidative stress. The novel finding of this study was a the identification of \u2018premature ageing phenotype\u2019. More specifically, telomere shortening which occurs naturally with aging is accelerated in SM-exposed individuals. Oxidative stress, mutations in DNA repair genes and epimutaions may be among the major mechanisms of telomere attrition. These findings may help for a novel therapeutic strategy by telomere elongation or for validation of an exposure biomarker for SM toxicity.",

Vehicular and industrial emissions are among the most important sources of air pollutants in these cities. Air pollution composition, dose, and time of exposure can cause differential effects on human health. We have evaluated the genotoxic effects of air pollution (PM2.5 and NO2) on S\u00e3o Paulo city workers. Fifty-seven male individuals, 28\u201366 years old, with occupational exposure to air pollution, participated in this study; all worked daily outdoor shifts in S\u00e3o Paulo. Participants were recruited from three occupations: traffic controllers (n\u2009=\u200918); taxi drivers (n\u2009=\u200921); and workers at the Forestry Institute (n\u2009=\u200918). These workers were classified into two groups based on their workplace locations: Downtown Group (DT): traffic controllers and taxi drivers; Outskirts of Town Group (OT): workers at the Forestry Institute. Individual samplers of air pollution (Harvard air impactor) were used to collect PM2.5 and NO2 pollutants. Genotoxicity analysis (micronucleus test) was performed on buccal mucosa epithelial cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes. PM2.5 concentrations were significantly different between the groups (DT\u2009=\u200932.92\u2009\u03bcg\u2009m\u22123, OT\u2009=\u200925.77\u2009\u03bcg\u2009m\u22123; p\u2009=\u20090.03); however, no difference was observed in NO2 concentrations.

The maximal frequency of micronuclei was observed in exposure of CHL/IU cells to ZnO nanoparticles at a concentration of 125\u2009\u03bcM. The frequency of micronuclei was profoundly enhanced when CHL/IU cells were exposed to ZnO nanoparticles in the presence vs. absence of S9 mixture including metabolic enzymes in the short-term treatment method, demonstrating an increase in the formation of micronuclei by S9 mixture. The maximal frequency of micronuclei was seen in exposure of CHL/IU cells to ZnO nanoparticles at a concentration of 140\u2009\u03bcM. Similar results were obtained in chromosome aberrations, particularly structural aberrations. Surprisingly, administration of the superoxide radical scavenger, tempol, completely abolished an increase in the frequency of micronuclei in the presence or absence of S9 mixture, indicating a central role of superoxide radical in the formation of micronuclei. Indeed, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was elevated by simultaneous incubation of S9 mixture and ZnO nanoparticles and by exposure of CHL/IU cells to ZnO nanoparticles in the presence or absence of S9 mixture. An electron microscopic examination revealed mitochondrial damage in CHL/IU cells exposed to ZnO nanoparticles, indicating the participation of mitochondrial dysfunction in ROS generation in this setting. These observations suggest that ZnO nanoparticles evoke genotoxicity through superoxide radical-induced oxidative stress derived from mitochondrial damage in CHL/IU cells. S9 mixture appears to contribute to a further increase in genotoxicity through the generation of superoxide radical by metabolic activation of ZnO nanoparticles.",

     "abstract": "We recently reported that cigarette sidestream smoke (CSS) can delay nucleotide excision repair (NER), which was due to the inhibition of repair protein accumulation to DNA damage sites. However, the mechanisms how the protein recruitment was inhibited remains unclear. We hypothesized that aldehydes in CSS could be a candidate taking a role for the inhibition, and tested our hypothesis by removing aldehydes from CSS using cigarette-filters. The NER inhibition potency of CSS or filtered CSS (F-CSS) was compared using human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. Cigarette-filters were able to reduce total aldehydes in CSS by half. Pretreating cells with CSS and F-CSS enhanced UVB-induced cell death, with the effect of CSS weakened by filtration.CSS strongly inhibited the repair of UVB-induced DNA damage, pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone photoproducts (6-4PPs), where the recruitments of repair molecules, TFIIH and XPG, were slowed down. F-CSS showed similar inhibition of NER and accumulation of related proteins, but the effect was weaker than CSS. Semicarbazide (SEM), an aldehyde-trapping agent, alleviated the NER delay induced by both CSS and F-CSS, further confirming that aldehydes in CSS were the main cause for the inhibition of NER and that the different amounts of aldehydes in CSS and F-CSS were responsible for the different inhibition efficiency. Furthermore, TFIIH level was decreased by treatment with CSS and restored in the presence of proteasome inhibitor, indicating that the degradation of NER proteins might be the cause of the inhibition of NER-protein recruitment. These results supported our hypothesis that aldehydes in CSS are the main contributor for the NER inhibition via protein degradation, and reconfirmed that exposure to CSS without filtration could be a severe threat to human health.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate rat GTHCs and non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens (NGTHCs) via selected gene expression patterns in the liver, as determined by next generation sequencing-targeted mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) and principal component analysis (PCA). Previously, we selected 11 marker genes (Aen, Bax, Btg2, Ccnf, Ccng1, Cdkn1a, Lrp1, Mbd1, Phlda3, Plk2, and Tubb4b) to discriminate GTHCs and NGTHCs. In the present study, we quantified changes in the expression of these genes following DO treatment, and compared them with treatment with two typical rat GTHCs, N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and 3,3\u2032-dimethylbenzidine\u00b72HCl (DMB), and a typical rat NGTHC, di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). RNA-Seq was conducted on liver samples from groups of five male, 10-week-old F344 rats after 4 weeks\u2019 feeding of chemicals in the water or the food. Rats in the control group were given water and a basal diet. Significant changes in gene expression in experimental groups compared with the control group were observed in eight genes (Aen, Bax, Btg2, Ccnf, Ccng1, Cdkn1a, Phlda3 and Plk2), as shown by Tukey\u2019s test. Gene expression profiles of the 11 genes under DO treatment differed significantly from those with DEN and DMB, as well as DEHP. Gene expression profiles with DO treatment differed partially from those with typical GTHCs for five genes (Bax, Btg2, Cdkn1a, Lrp1 and Plk2) and were substantially different from treatment with a typical NGTHC (DEHP) for nine genes (Aen, Bax, Btg2, Ccnf, Ccng1, Cdkn1a, Mbd1, Phlda3 and Tubb4b) as determined by Tukey\u2019s test. Finally, PCA successfully differentiated GTHCs from DEHP and DO with the 11 genes. The present results suggest that RNA-Seq and PCA are useful to evaluate rat typical GTHCs and typical NGTHCs. DO was suggested to result in a different intermediate gene expression profile from typical GTHCs and NGTHC.",

     "abstract": "The liver's role in metabolism of chemicals makes it an appropriate tissue for toxicity testing. Current testing protocols, such as animal testing and two-dimensional liver cell systems, offer limited resemblance to in vivo liver cell behaviour, in terms of gene expression profiles and metabolic competence; thus, they do not always accurately predict human toxicology. In vitro three-dimensional liver cell models offer an attractive alternative. This study reports on the development of a 3D liver model, using HepG2 cells, by a hanging-drop technique, with a focus on evaluating spheroid growth characteristics and suitability for genotoxicity testing. The cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay protocol was adapted to enable micronucleus (MN) detection in the 3D spheroid models. This involved evaluating the difference between hanging vs non-hanging drop positions for dosing of the test agents and comparison of automated Metafer scoring with manual scoring for MN detection in HepG2 spheroids. The initial seeding density, used for all experiments, was 5000 cells/20\u202f\u03bcl drop hanging spheroids, harvested on day 4, with >75% cell viability. Albumin secretion (7.8\u202fg/l) and both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 gene expression were highest in the 3D environment at day 4. Exposure to metabolically activated genotoxicants for 24\u202fh resulted in a 6-fold increase in CYP1A1 enzyme activity (3\u202f\u03bcM B[a]P) and a 30-fold increase in CYP1A2 enzyme activity (5\u202f\u03bcM PhIP) in 3D hanging spheroids. MN inductions in response to B[a]P or PhIP were 2-fold and 3-fold, respectively, and were greater in 3D hanging spheroids than in 2D format, showing that hanging spheroids are more sensitive to genotoxic agents. HepG2 hanging-drop spheroids are an exciting new alternative system for genotoxicity studies, due to their improved structural and physiological properties, relative to 2D cultures.",

However, important data gaps exist for selecting an optimal approach for simultaneously evaluating mutagenicity in both cell types. It is uncertain whether analysis of germ cells from seminiferous tubules (hereafter, tubule germ cells) or caudal sperm within the recommended design for somatic tissues (i.e., 28 days of exposure plus three days of fixation time, 28\u202f+\u202f3d) has enough sensitivity to detect an effect as compared with the analysis of sperm within the recommended design for germ cells (i.e., 28\u202f+\u202f49d and 28\u202f+\u202f70d for mouse and rat, respectively). To address these data gaps, the Germ Cell workgroup of the Genetic Toxicology Technical Committee of the Health and Environmental Sciences Institute reviewed the available TGR mutagenicity data in male germ cells, and, characterized the exposure history of tubule germ cells for different sampling times to evaluate its impact on germ cell mutagenicity testing using TG 488. Our analyses suggest that evaluating mutant frequencies in: i) sperm from the cauda epididymis at 28\u202f+\u202f3d does not provide meaningful mutagenicity data; ii), tubule germ cells at 28\u202f+\u202f3d provides reliable mutagenicity data only if the results are positive; and iii) tubule germ cells at 28\u202f+\u202f28d produces reliable positive and negative results in both mice and rats. Thus, the 28\u202f+\u202f28d regimen may provide an approach for simultaneously assessing mutagenicity in somatic tissues and germ cells from the same animals. Further work is required to support the 28\u202f+\u202f28d protocol for tissues other than slowly proliferating tissues as per current TG 488.

Although the latter protocol is commonly used for mutagenicity testing in somatic tissues, it has several shortcomings for germ cell testing because it provides limited exposure of the proliferating phase of spermatogenesis when mutations are fixed in the transgene. Indeed, analysis of sperm at 28\u202f+\u202f3d has generated negative results with established germ cell mutagens, while the analysis of tubule germ cells has generated both positive and either negative or equivocal results. The Germ Cell workgroup of the Genetic Toxicology Technical Committee of the Health and Environmental Sciences Institute modelled mouse and rat spermatogenesis to better define the exposure history of the cell population collected from seminiferous tubules. The modelling showed that mouse tubule germ cells at 28\u202f+\u202f3d receive, as a whole, 42% of the total exposure during the proliferating phase. This percentage increases to 99% at 28\u202f+\u202f28d and reaches 100% at 28\u202f+\u202f30d. In the rat, these percentages are 22% and 80% at 28\u202f+\u202f3d and 28\u202f+\u202f28d, reaching 100% at 28\u202f+\u202f44d. These results show that analysis of tubule germ cells at 28\u202f+\u202f28d may be an effective protocol for assessing germ cell mutagenicity in mice and rats using TG 488. Since TG 488 recommends the 28\u202f+\u202f28d protocol for slow dividing somatic tissues, this appears to be a better compromise than 28\u202f+\u202f3d when slow dividing somatic tissues or germ cells are the critical tissues of interest.",

Therefore, the gender of donors affects the baseline and radiation-induced levels of NPB and MN. In addition, the effect of the age of the donors on the baseline and radiation-induced NPB levels showed no clear pattern and needed to be further investigated.",

We have followed the induction of ICL in the DNA of different organs of Wistar rats and Balb/c or NMRI mice by the percutaneous application of SM using the modified (reverse) comet assay. Significant amounts of ICL were found in Balb/C lymphocytes, in bone marrow and liver cells after the dose of 80\u202fmg/kg. A dose-dependent amount of ICL was induced in rats, with efficient induction in lymphocytes and spleen cells already after 5\u202fmg SM/kg, indicating a higher susceptibility of rats to the DNA-damaging effect of SM compared with mice. A significant induction of ICL in other tested tissues (liver, bone marrow, colon epithelium) was seen at the dose of 20\u202fmg/kg. The induced ICL were removed from the DNA during 48\u202fh except for rats at the dose of 80\u202fmg/kg. In fact, we observed that ICL are almost completely repaired in tissues of rats receiving high lethal doses. Results suggest that the unhooking of ICL, which we followed with the comet assay, may lead to the formation of another toxic DNA lesion during the repair process.",

The partial p53 gene sequence of Rita rita generated showed a high degree of similarities with the DNA binding domains of fishes, mice and human. Transcriptomic analysis, carried out by quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), showed significant down-regulation of p53 in fishes collected from most of the polluted stretches. Similar trend in protein abundance was observed by western blot analysis. Down-regulation of p53 was more pronounced in gill than liver. Expression patterns of p53 suggest that exposure to a multitude of contaminants in the natural riverine ecosystem could suppress the expression of p53. Genomic DNA showed a low stained smear pattern upon electrophoresis, with no evidence of DNA fragmentation. For mutation analysis PCR-SSCP followed by sequence analysis was carried out, which identified eight mutations; two at codon level and six missense mutations in the DNA binding domain IV and V. Secondary structure prediction showed that these mutations could lead to impairment of protein structure. Thus, the present study indicated that aquatic pollution has impacted these lower vertebrates which are reflected by the down-regulation of tumor suppressor protein (p53) in majority of the stretches studied.",

     "abstract": "Maternal alcoholism can induce serious injuries in embryonic and fetal development. The metabolism of alcohol increases the production of free radicals and acetaldehyde, molecules capable of reacting with DNA, impairing organogenesis. Melatonin is a powerful antioxidant that can act as a protective agent against DNA damage caused by genotoxic agents, such as ethanol. This study evaluated the protective effect of exogenous melatonin in rats and their offspring on the genotoxic response induced by chronic alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Twenty-five pregnant rats were divided into the following groups: NC - Negative control; ET - Rats receiving ethanol (3\u202fg/kg/day); ET+10\u202fM - Rats receiving ethanol (3\u202fg/kg/day) and melatonin (10\u202fmg/kg/day); ET+15\u202fM - Rats receiving ethanol (3\u202fg/kg/day) and melatonin (15\u202fmg/kg/day); PC - Positive control (40\u202fmg/kg cyclophosphamide). The dams and 10 pups (five males and five females) from each group were anesthetized to collect blood and liver from the dams and blood, liver and brain of neonates to evaluate the frequency of DNA damage by the comet assay. Blood was also used for the micronucleus test. The results demonstrated a significant increase in DNA damage in the blood and liver cells of dams receiving ethanol and their offspring as well as in the brain of these neonates. Treatments with melatonin (10 and 15\u202fmg/kg/day) significantly reduced the genotoxicity caused by ethanol in the blood of dams and neonates (males and females), liver of dams and male offsprings, and in the brain of female offsprings. It was shown that only the female offspring exposed to maternal alcohol consumption showed a higher frequency of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes. Consequently, exogenous melatonin may be a promising therapeutic agent against genotoxic damage induced by alcohol; however, further studies are needed to confirm these benefits.",

Although inorganic arsenical species are the prevalent forms of arsenic in the environment, monomethylarsonous acid (MMA+3) is the major arsenical species found in immune-system cells, in this 30 d drinking-water-exposure study in mice. Therefore, the effect of MMA+3 on NK cells should be studied as a possible contributor to arsenic-induced toxicity at environmental exposure levels. In the mouse drinking-water-exposure model, As+3 induces dose-dependent DNA damage in NK cells. In in vitro studies, MMA+3 inhibited cell growth and induced DNA damage and oxidative stress at low concentration (20 and 50\u202fnM) in isolated mouse NK cells. Strong correlations were found between DNA damage and oxidative stress in MMA+3-treated mouse NK cells. Even at low concentrations relevant to environmental arsenic exposures, MMA+3 is genotoxic to primary mouse NK cells.",

Medical residents spend several hours per day in operating rooms and consequently experience occupational exposure to WAGs. Considering that no studies have yet evaluated the potential toxicity in medical residents exposed to WAGs using the buccal micronucleus cytome (BMCyt) assay, this pioneering study aimed to compare the BMCyt assay markers, including DNA damage, cell proliferation, and cell death in the exfoliated buccal cells of surgery and anesthesiology residents occupationally exposed to WAGs. The study enrolled a total of 60 physicians, including internal medicine residents (unexposed group), and residents from surgery and anesthesiology programs who were occupationally exposed to sevoflurane, isoflurane and nitrous oxide. WAGs were measured, and the mean values were higher than the international recommendation. The anesthesiology residents (high exposure) showed statistically significant lower frequencies of basal cells, and statistically significant higher frequencies of micronuclei, karyorrhexis, pyknosis, and differentiated cells than did the unexposed group; karyolysis frequencies were significantly higher in anesthesiology residents than were those in the unexposed group or in surgical residents (low exposure). The findings suggest a genetic risk for young professionals exposed to WAGs at the beginning of their careers. Thus, exposure to high WAGs concentrations leads to impairment of the buccal cell proliferative potential, genomic instability and cell death, especially in anesthesiology residents, demonstrating an early impact on their health.",

The survival rate and the frequency of micronuclei in mice and excretion of DNA into rat urine were determined after administration of the drug before and after irradiation of animals. The DNA content was measured by qRT-PCR. Metformin shows a radioprotective effect only when administered to mice after the radiation exposure. On the 11th day after irradiation, we observed 100% mortality in the control group; 78% of mice remained alive if metformin was given. Twenty percent of the mice in this group survived for 30\u202fdays after irradiation. Metformin has the same effect on the frequency of micronuclei; its reduction is observed, when the drug is administered to the mice after irradiation. Metformin promotes the excretion of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA with the urine of irradiated rats. The results show that metformin acts as a radiomitigation effector.

This was consistent with lower levels of reactive oxygen species, higher mitochondrial membrane potential, and increased activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, thioredoxin reductase, and glutathione peroxidase, in the primed cells. Reduced oxidative stress in primed PBMCs correlated with greater nuclear translocation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Distinct differences in responses were seen in PBMCs irradiated with low dose (100\u202fmGy) and high dose (2\u202fGy).

Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with vehicle or test substance on three consecutive days. Blood samples were collected for measuring Pig-a mutant phenotypes (CD59-deficient erythrocytes, RBCCD59\u2212; CD59-deficient reticulocytes, RETCD59\u2212) on days \u22121, 15, and 29 after the first treatment. In some studies, blood was collected for determining DNA damage (comet assay) on day 3 and measuring micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RET) on day 4. Treatment with the alkylating agents PS and PNU induced dose-dependent increases in the frequency of RBCCD59\u2212 on days 15 and 29, and caused maximum elevations in the frequency of RETCD59\u2212 on day 15. Inter-laboratory comparison of the day 29 Pig-a assay data confirmed the mutagenic potencies of PS and PNU, and showed good agreement among the test sites. Treatment with the DNA cross-linker MMC induced increases in the frequencies of RBCCD59\u2212 and RETCD59\u2212 on days 15 and 29 (all three laboratories). MN-RETs increased significantly in animals treated with PS, PNU, or MMC, but biologically significant increases in DNA damage were observed only with PS and PNU, and not with MMC. The results of this study indicate that the Pig-a assay is a sensitive, reproducible method for evaluating the in vivo mutagenicity of various test substances, in particular, DNA cross-linkers and alkylating agents. Our limited data on integrating the Pig-a assay with the comet and micronucleus assays indicate that a short-term treatment protocol evaluating these three endpoints in a single set of animals may be a robust strategy for evaluating in vivo genotoxicity.",

The topic was reviewed by DeMarini and coworkers in 2007. Here, we review research on the genotoxicity of DBPs published since that time. Studies, primarily using the Salmonella mutagenicity assay, have continued to show that chlorination or chloramination of source waters results in finished, tap, or swimming pool/spa water that is more mutagenic than the original source water. The genotoxic potencies of DBPs in both bacterial and mammalian cells generally rank as iodinated > brominated > chlorinated. Several DBPs are genotoxic in vivo in plants as well as in animals such as the worm Caenorhabditis elegans and the zebrafish Danio rerio. Studies primarily using the comet assay in mammalian cells have identified several non-regulated DBPs as genotoxic. However, the comet assay detects DNA damage that is generally repaired by the cells; thus, genotoxicity data more relevant to persistent mutations, such as chromosomal or gene mutations, are needed for these DBPs. Recent molecular epidemiology has indicated that activation of brominated trihalomethanes by the enzyme GSTT1 and the lack of metabolism of haloacetic acids by a variant of enzyme GSTZ1 are likely causative mechanisms for bladder cancer associated with exposure to chlorinated water. Further studies, especially in vivo, are needed to determine the ability of various DBPs, especially unregulated ones, to induce both gene as well as chromosomal mutations. Such investigations, along with additional molecular epidemiology studies, are required for a comprehensive understanding of the genotoxic and carcinogenic risks associated with DBP exposure.",

     "abstract": "Mutations in germ cells pose potential genetic risks to offspring. However, de novo mutations are rare events that are spread across the genome and are difficult to detect. Thus, studies in this area have generally been under-powered, and no human germ cell mutagen has been identified. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of human pedigrees has been proposed as an approach to overcome these technical and statistical challenges. WGS enables analysis of a much wider breadth of the genome than traditional approaches. Here, we performed power analyses to determine the feasibility of using WGS in human families to identify germ cell mutagens. Different statistical models were compared in the power analyses (ANOVA and multiple regression for one-child families, and mixed effect model sampling between two to four siblings per family). Assumptions were made based on parameters from the existing literature, such as the mutation-by-paternal age effect. We explored two scenarios: a constant effect due to an exposure that occurred in the past, and an accumulating effect where the exposure is continuing. Our analysis revealed the importance of modeling inter-family variability of the mutation-by-paternal age effect. Statistical power was improved by models accounting for the family-to-family variability. Our power analyses suggest that sufficient statistical power can be attained with 4\u201328 four-sibling families per treatment group, when the increase in mutations ranges from 40 to 10% respectively. Modeling family variability using mixed effect models provided a reduction in sample size compared to a multiple regression approach. Much larger sample sizes were required to detect an interaction effect between environmental exposures and paternal age. These findings inform study design and statistical modeling approaches to improve power and reduce sequencing costs for future studies in this area.",

     "abstract": "Imidacloprid (IMI) is a systemic, chloro-nicotinyl insecticide classified in Regulation N\u00b0 1272/2008 of the European Commision as \u201charmful if swallowed and very toxic to aquatic life, with long-lasting effects\u201d. IMI is metabolized in vitro both by aldehyde oxidase (AOX) (reduction) and by cytochrome P450s enzymes (CYPs). In the present study, the AOX inhibitor sodium tungstate dihydrate (ST) was used to elucidate the relative contribution of CYP 450 and AOX metabolic pathways on IMI metabolism, in male rabbits exposed to IMI for two months. To evaluate the inhibition effectiveness, various metabolite concentrations in the IMI and IMI\u202f+\u202fST exposed groups were monitored. DNA damage was also evaluated in micronucleus (MN) and single cell electrophoresis (SCGC) assays in both groups, along with oxidative stress (OS) with the inflammatory status of the exposed animals, in order to clarify which metabolic pathway is more detrimental in this experimental setting. A significant increase in the frequency of binucleated cells with MN (BNMN, 105%) and micronuclei (MN, 142%) was observed after exposure to IMI (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The increase in the ST co-exposed animals was less pronounced (BNMN 75%, MN 95%). The Cytokinesis Block Proliferation Index (CBPI) showed no significant difference between controls and exposed animals at any time of exposure (p\u202f>\u202f0.05), which indicates no cytotoxic effect. Similarly, comet results show that the IMI group exhibited the highest achieved tail intensity, which reached 70.7% over the control groups, whereas in the IMI\u202f+\u202fST groups the increase remained at 48.5%. No differences were observed between all groups for oxidative-stress biomarkers. The results indicate that the AOX metabolic pathway plays a more important role in the systemic toxicity of IMI.",

In addition, a compositional analysis was conducted to identify the main components, mainly Chlorogenic acid isomers (CGA) and derivatives present in the extracts using UHPLC-ESI(\u00b1) and HRMS/MS methods According to the results, all extracts exhibited strong antimutagenic activity against the oxidizing factor tert-Butyl hydroperoxide, a Reactive Oxygen Species-producing compound. Roasting had a distinct effect on the antimutagenic activity of coffee, enhancing it in the Brazil variety and having no effect in the Decaf and Robusta varieties. In addition, all coffee extracts exhibited reducing activity as well as the ability to scavenge (albeit differentially) both the superoxide and hydroxyl radicals, implying that their potential antimutagenic effect can be partially attributed to their free radical scavenging activity.",

     "abstract": "New in vitro studies have demonstrated that N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine (Melatonin) has cytotoxic and apoptotic effects on various cell types although most of the previous investigations document that it is a potent antioxidant. However, the precise molecular mechanism(s) of its effects are not fully elucidated. In this study, we examined dose-dependent cytotoxic, genotoxic, apoptotic and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generating effects of melatonin in human epidermoid carcinoma cells (A-431) and human normal skin fibroblastic cells (CCD-1079Sk). The cells were incubated with different doses of melatonin (0.031\u20135\u202fmM) for 24\u202fh. Cell viability was assessed based on luminometric ATP cell viability assay. Intracellular ROS was detected using 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein-diacetate (H2DCF-DA) fluorescent probes. Genotoxicity was evaluated by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis assay (Comet Assay). Apoptosis was evaluated by western blotting, DAPI staining, acridine orange/ethidium bromide and Annexin V\u2010FITC/propidium iodide double staining methods Mitochondrial membrane potentials were measured by flow cytometry. Although lower doses of melatonin (0.031\u20130.06\u202fmM) increased cell proliferation and decreased ROS generation, higher doses (0.125\u20135\u202fmM) markedly inhibited the cell viability, induced DNA damage, apoptosis and ROS generation. Cytotoxic, genotoxic, apoptotic and ROS generating effects were significantly higher in cancer cells than those observed in normal cells. Melatonin-induced cell death, and ROS generating activity were effectively inhibited by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) In conclusion, at low doses, melatonin has proliferative effects on both cancer and normal cells, whereas high concentrations have cytotoxic effects. Cytotoxic, genotoxic and apoptotic effects at higher doses of melatonin may be due to its ROS production capacity.",

These reporters can only detect mutations in narrow areas of the genome and their use is often restricted to certain in vitro and in vivo models. Here, we show that Interclonal Genetic Variation (ICGV) can directly identify mutations genome-wide by comparing sequencing data of single-cell clones derived from the same source or organism. Upon ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) exposure, ICGV detected greater levels of mutation in a dose- and time-dependent manner in E. coli. In addition, ICGV was also able to identify a \u223c20-fold increase in somatic mutations in T-cell clones derived from an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated rat vs. a vehicle-treated rat. These results demonstrate that the genetic differences of single-cell clones can be used for genome-wide mutation detection.",

     "abstract": "We investigated the commercially available Episkin LM\u2122 reconstructed epidermis test system as a potential 3D model for human genotoxicity assessment by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay to mitigate limitations of the currently accepted micronucleus test.We established appropriate culture conditions for cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in maximizing the frequency of binucleated cells by choice of culture medium and calibration of the system exposure to the cytokinesis inhibitor Cytochalasin B, without affecting the basal frequency of micronuclei in the model. We confirmed that the application of the classic solvents had no significant effect on this basal level of micronuclei.We determined the performance of cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in Episkin LM\u2122 reconstructed epidermis to predict in vivo genotoxins by testing the genotoxicity potential of 17 well known in vivo genotoxic, progenotoxic and non-genotoxic reference chemicals over a 48\u202fh and 72\u202fh exposure period.We found that cytokinesis-block micronucleus assays in Episkin\u2122 reconstructed epidermis following the 48 h-topical regimen had a specificity of 60\u201375% and a sensitivity of 83\u201385%, resulting in an overall accuracy of 76\u201382% for genotoxicity assessment in tissues depending on the assessment of the reference chemicals with equivocal genotoxic profiles in the literature.The positive micronucleus test results obtained without addition of any exogenous metabolic activation system confirmed the ability of Episkin LM\u2122 reconstructed epidermis to intrinsically bioactivate progenotoxic chemicals. The evidence showed that the 72-h exposure protocol significantly improved the detection of progenotoxins.Taken together, our data demonstrated that the Episkin LM\u2122 reconstructed epidermis system is a relevant in vitro tool in the study of genetic toxicology.",

     "abstract": "DNA polymerases play a key role in mutagenesis by performing translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). The Y-family of DNA polymerases comprises several evolutionarily conserved families, specializing in TLS of different DNA adducts. Exocyclic etheno and propano DNA adducts are among the most common endogenous DNA lesions induced by lipid peroxidation reactions triggered by oxidative stress. We have investigated the participation of two enterobacterial representatives of the PolIV and PolV branches of Y-family DNA polymerases in mutagenesis by two model lipid peroxidation derived genotoxins, glyoxal and crotonaldehyde. Mutagenesis by the ethano adduct (glyoxal-derived) and the propano adduct (crontonaldehyde-derived) at the GC target in the Ames test depended exclusively on PolV type DNA polymerases such as PolRI. In contrast, PolIV suppressed glyoxal and, even more, crotonaldehyde mutagenesis, as detected by enzyme overexpression and gene knockout approaches. We propose that DNA polymerase IV, which is the mammalian DNA polymerase \u03ba ortholog, acts as a housekeeper protecting the genome from lipoxidative stress.",

Although increased levels of \u03b3H2AX have been reported in neuronal nuclei of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) patients, \u03b3H2AX responses in the lymphocytes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD remain unexplored. In this study, the endogenous \u03b3H2AX level was measured, using laser scanning cytometry (LSC) and visual scoring, in lymphocyte nuclei from MCI (n\u202f=\u202f18), or AD (n\u202f=\u202f20) patients and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f40). Levels were significantly elevated in nuclei of the AD group compared to the MCI and control groups, and there was a concomitant increase, with a significant trend, from the control group through MCI to the AD group. A significant negative correlation was seen between \u03b3H2AX and the mini mental state examination (MMSE) score, when the analysis included all subjects. Receiver Operation Characteristic curves were carried out for different \u03b3H2AX parameters; visually scored percent cells containing overlapping \u03b3H2AX foci displayed the best area under the curve value of 0.9081 with 85% sensitivity and 92% specificity for the identification of AD patients versus control. Plasma homocysteine, creatinine, and chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) were positively correlated with lymphocyte \u03b3H2AX signals, while glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was negatively correlated. Finally, there was a diminished \u03b3H2AX response to X-rays in lymphocytes of the MCI and AD groups compared to the control group. Our results indicate that lymphocyte \u03b3H2AX levels are a potential marker for identifying individuals at increased risk of developing AD.

     "abstract": "In regulatory genetic toxicology, it is an axiom that there is no threshold for genotoxicity of chemicals, such that genotoxic chemicals may impose carcinogenic risk on humans even at very low doses. This paradigm is counterintuitive, however, because humans possess a number of self-defense mechanisms that may suppress the genotoxicity at these low doses and therefore manifest a practical threshold. DNA polymerase zeta (Pol \u03b6) is a specialized Pol that plays an important role in DNA synthesis across DNA damage, thereby modulating cell survival and genotoxicity. In this study, we compared the sensitivity of three types of human cells: D2781N, L2618M, and their wild-type (WT) cells, to the low dose effects of genotoxicity of the oxidizing agents, potassium bromate (KBrO3) and sodium dichromate (Na2Cr2O7). D2781N cells express a variant form of Pol \u03b6, whose activity is weaker than that of the WT enzyme. L2618M cells express another variant form of Pol \u03b6, whose fidelity of DNA replication is lower than that of the WT enzyme. D2781N exhibited the highest sensitivity for TK gene mutation and micronucleus (MN) formation and displayed the lowest practical threshold for MN induction by KBrO3. In contrast, L2618M exhibited the lowest practical threshold for sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) induction by both chemicals. These results suggest that Pol \u03b6 mutations have significant impacts on practical thresholds of genotoxicity; the factors affecting the practical threshold can differ depending on the endpoint of genotoxicity. Roles of the variant forms of Pol \u03b6 in genotoxicity by the oxidizing agents are discussed.",

S. typhimurium strains TA98, TA100, TA97, TA104 and E. coli WP2 uvrA pKM101 with or without metabolic activation (S9), were employed. Using a modified Vitrocell VC 10 exposure system 0, 180, 360, 540, 720 or 900 puffs of undiluted e-cigarette aerosol was generated and delivered to bacterial cultures aligned to reported human consumption data.

The mean age of individuals from NLNRA and HLNRA was 40.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.4 and 43.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.4\u202fyears, respectively, with an overall mean of 42.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.6 (range: 18\u201380). Whole-blood cultures were set up and about 260 metaphases were scored per individual. The frequency of chromosome aberrations was calculated per 1000 cells. The overall basal frequency of unstable (dicentrics and rings), stable (translocations and inversions) and other (fragments and breaks) aberrations was 1.54\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.25, 4.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.40 and 6.66\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.51, respectively.

Metformin reduces DNA damage by mechanisms that are only incompletely understood. Metformin scavenges free radicals, including reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, which are produced by genotoxicants such as ionizing or non-ionizing radiation, heavy metals, and chemotherapeutic agents. The drug may also increase the activities of antioxidant enzymes and inhibit NADPH oxidase, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, thereby limiting macrophage recruitment and inflammatory responses. Metformin stimulates the DNA damage response (DDR) in the homologous end-joining, homologous recombination, and nucleotide excision repair pathways.

The mixtures of B[a]P and metals induced a maximum of four fold increase in the MN formation compared to B[a]P alone. The higher combination of PAHs and metals did not significantly increase the MN formation. The mixtures of metals or non-carcinogenic PAHs were found to increase or decrease the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation of B[a]P in HepG2 cell based CAFLUX assay. Overall, the results showed that combined genotoxicity of PAHs and metals in HepG2 cells vary depending on the concentrations and number of the chemicals that are present in the mixtures and the effects of higher order combinations appear to be largely unpredictable from binary combinations.

Understanding the genotoxicity and the cytotoxicity alongside the characteristics of corrosion behavior of the alloy is vital for understanding their biocompatibility. This study has evaluated whether the Ni-Cr based alloys corroded in artificial saliva by analyzing alloy decomposition at different pH levels and immersion durations(7, 14, 21, and 28\u202fdays) using inductively coupled plasma-optic emission spectrophotometry(ICP-OES). The principal aim of the study was to determine the possible genotoxicity and cytotoxicity using micronucleus(MN) and other nuclear anomaly frequencies [nuclear bud(NBUD), binucleated(BNC), condensed chromatin(CC), karyorrhectic(KhC), pyknotic(PC) and karyolytic(KC) cells] and various cytome parameters [basal cells(BC), differentiated cells(DF)] with the buccal epithelial cell(BEC) micronucleus cytome assay(BMCyt). This test was administered at 1 pre- and 3 post-treatment time points to 40 patients who underwent installation of PFM-FDPs made of Ni-Cr based alloy. Furthermore, at the final post-treatment time point, saliva cotinine levels were measured with salivary cotinine quantitative enzyme immunoassay(EIA) kit and information obtained by questionnaire prior to the first pre-treatment time point was confirmed. The highest greatest release of Ni and Cr ions were seen at pH 2.3. MN and micronucleated cell frequencies, and BNC cell frequencies were significantly elevated at post-treatment time points(p\u202f<\u202f0.03). BC, CC, KhC, PC and KC cell frequencies however were not significantly different between pre-and post-treatment time points(p\u202f>\u202f0.05). MN frequency was significantly lower in non-smokers than in current and former smokers(p\u202f<\u202f0.001) at the pre-treatment time point. There was no significant correlation between the unit number of PFM-FDPs and MN frequencies.

     "abstract": "Recently revised OECD Testing Guidelines highlight the importance of considering the first site-of-contact when investigating the genotoxic hazard. Thus far, only in vivo approaches are available to address the dermal route of exposure. The 3D Skin Comet and Reconstructed Skin Micronucleus (RSMN) assays intend to close this gap in the in vitro genotoxicity toolbox by investigating DNA damage after topical application. This represents the most relevant route of exposure for a variety of compounds found in household products, cosmetics, and industrial chemicals.The comet assay methodology is able to detect both chromosomal damage and DNA lesions that may give rise to gene mutations, thereby complementing the RSMN which detects only chromosomal damage. Here, the comet assay was adapted to two reconstructed full thickness human skin models: the EpiDerm\u2122- and Phenion\u00ae Full-Thickness Skin Models. First, tissue-specific protocols for the isolation of single cells and the general comet assay were transferred to European and US-American laboratories. After establishment of the assay, the protocol was then further optimized with appropriate cytotoxicity measurements and the use of aphidicolin, a DNA repair inhibitor, to improve the assay\u2019s sensitivity.In the first phase of an ongoing validation study eight chemicals were tested in three laboratories each using the Phenion\u00ae Full-Thickness Skin Model, informing several validation modules. Ultimately, the 3D Skin Comet assay demonstrated a high predictive capacity and good intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility with four laboratories reaching a 100% predictivity and the fifth yielding 70%.The data are intended to demonstrate the use of the 3D Skin Comet assay as a new in vitro tool for following up on positive findings from the standard in vitro genotoxicity test battery for dermally applied chemicals, ultimately helping to drive the regulatory acceptance of the assay. To expand the database, the validation will continue by testing an additional 22 chemicals.",

     "abstract": "Naphthalene is a carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, to which humans are exposed as an air pollutant. Naphthalene is metabolized in humans to reactive intermediates such as 1,2-hydroxynaphthalene (1,2-NQH2), 1,4-NQH2, 1,2-naphthoquinone (1,2-NQ), and 1,4-NQ. We examined oxidative DNA damage by these naphthalene metabolites using 32P-labeled DNA fragments from human cancer-relevant genes. 1,2-NQH2 and 1,4-NQH2 induced DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II). The DNA-damaging activity of 1,2-NQH2 was significantly increased in the presence of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), whereas that of 1,4-NQH2 was not. In the presence of NADH, 1,2-NQ induced Cu(II)-dependent DNA damage, whereas 1,4-NQ did not. The calculated energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), which corresponds to the reduction potential, was estimated to be \u22120.67\u202feV for 1,2-NQ and \u22120.75\u202feV for 1,4-NQ. These results suggest that 1,2-NQ was reduced more easily than 1,4-NQ. Furthermore, 1,2-NQH2, 1,4-NQH2, and 1,2-NQ plus NADH formed 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) as an oxidative DNA marker. Catalase and bathocuproine inhibited DNA damage, suggesting that H2O2 and Cu(I) were involved. These results indicate that NQH2s are oxidized to the corresponding NQs via semiquinone radicals, and that H2O2 and Cu(I) are generated during oxidation. 1,2-NQ is reduced by NADH to form the redox cycle, resulting in enhanced DNA damage. The formation of the corresponding semiquinone radicals was supported by an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) study. In conclusion, the redox cycle of 1,2-NQ/1,2-NQH2 may play a more important role in the carcinogenicity of naphthalene than that of 1,4-NQ/1,4-NQH2.",

     "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with particulate matter (PM) may induce oxidative damage via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. However, the kinetics of ROS production and the link with antioxidant response induction has not been well studied. To elucidate the differences in oxidative potential of individual PAH compounds and extractable organic matter (EOM) from PM containing various PAH mixtures, we studied ROS formation and antioxidant response [total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and expression of HMOX1 and TXNRD1] in human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 cells) and human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HEL12469 cells). We treated the cells with three concentrations of model PAHs (benzo[a]pyrene, B[a]P; 3-nitrobenzanthrone, 3-NBA) and EOM from PM <2.5\u202f\u03bcm (PM2.5). ROS levels were evaluated at 8 time intervals (30\u202fmin\u201324\u202fh). In both cell lines, B[a]P treatment was associated with a time-dependent decrease of ROS levels. This trend was more pronounced in HEL12469 cells and was accompanied by increased TAC. A similar response was observed upon 3-NBA treatment in HEL12469 cells. In A549 cells, however, this compound significantly increased superoxide levels. This response was accompanied by the decrease of TAC as well as HMOX1 and TXNRD1 expression. In both cell lines, a short-time exposure to EOMs tended to increase ROS levels, while a marked decrease was observed after longer treatment periods. This was accompanied by the induction of HMOX1 and TXNRD1 expression in HEL12469 cells and increased TAC in A549 cells. In summary, our data indicate that in the studied cell lines B[a]P and EOMs caused a time-dependent decrease of intracellular ROS levels, probably due to the activation of the antioxidant response. This response was not detected in A549 cells following 3-NBA treatment, which acted as a strong superoxide inducer. Pro-oxidant properties of EOMs are limited to short-time exposure periods.",

The goal of this study was to select an appropriate cell line for optimization of the in vitro comet assay to assess DNA damage. We then evaluated the predictivity of the in vitro comet assay using the selected cell line. In addition, the effect of adding S9 was evaluated using 12 test chemicals. For cell line selection, HepG2, Chinese hamster lung (CHL/IU), and TK6 cell lines were evaluated. We employed a method for the in vitro comet assay based on that for the in vivo comet assay. The most appropriate cell line was determined by% tail DNA increase after performing in vitro comet assays with 6 test chemicals. The predictivity of the in vitro comet assay using the selected cell line was measured with 10 test chemicals (8 genotoxins and 2 non-genotoxic chemicals). The HepG2 cell line was found to be the most appropriate, and in vitro comet assays using HepG2 cells exhibited a high accuracy of 90% (9/10).

The present study aimed to assess the antimutagenic efficacy of a flavonoid fraction of Cajanus cajan (FFCC) to reduce cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by cyclophosphamide (CP). We assessed genotoxic and cytotoxic effects using chromosome aberration, in mouse bone-marrow cells and spermatocytes, cell viability and DNA damage, in mouse bone-marrow cells. Animals received FFCC at concentrations 50,100 and 200\u202fmg/kg\u202fb\u202fwt by oral gavage, and injected simultaneously with CP (20\u202fmg/kg\u202fb\u202fwt) for 24\u202fh.

Moreover, we observed significant inhibition of CP-induced chromosome abnormalities in both, somatic and germ, cells (p\u202f\u226a\u202f0.05) after concurrent administration of different concentrations of FFCC and CP. FFCC reduced chromosome aberrations by 14.29%, 25.21% and 28.57% in somatic cells, and 25.35%, 35.21% and 49.29% in germ cells after simultaneous treatment with CP respectively. Additionally, FFCC improved the cell viability of bone-marrow cells in a concentration-dependent manner when administered concurrently with CP. Similarly, FFCC diminished DNA damage (p\u202f\u226a\u202f0.05) in CP-treated animals. The inhibitory index of tail DNA (%) reached 90.6% at the highest concentration of FFCC when administered simultaneously with CP. In conclusion, the flavonoid extract improved cell viability and protected animal cells from the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects exhibited by CP. Cajanus cajan flavonoids might contain the antioxidant bioactivity that effectively lessened chromosome aberrations and DNA damage induced by mutagenic agents.",

We evaluated CM genotoxicity and the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in retinal cells of adult zebrafish. Histological and immunofluorescence techniques show the presence of apoptotic cells in the zebrafish retina after 9 d of treatment with 0.6\u202f\u03bcg/L CM. Histone \u03b3-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, was detected in both outer and inner nuclear layers; caspase-3, an apoptotic marker, was detected in the outer nuclear layer. In the comet assay, the cells were sensitive to hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage, showing a dose-dependent response. We observed a positive comet assay response to CM that was dose- and time-dependent. Following exposure to CM, SOD and CAT enzyme activities, and sod and cat mRNA levels, increased. These results indicate that CM causes DNA damage and oxidative stress and can induce apoptosis in retinal cells.",

Aberrant DNA methylation is one of the best known epigenetic changes in human cancers and healthy subjects exposed to carcinogens. The purpose of this study is to explore the factors influencing the methylation of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1) and aryl-hydrocarbon receptor repressor (AhRR) in coke oven workers. The study population is composed by coke oven workers (348) and water treatment workers (131). And their urinary PAH metabolites were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography; DNA methylation were measured by pyrosequencing. The urinary PAHs metabolites were significantly elevated in coke oven workers (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). The results from multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that a high level of urinary 1-hydroxypyrene was associated with a significantly increased risk of hypomethylation of LINE-1 (OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.25, 2.60), and heavy smoking was associated with a significantly increased risk of hypomethylation of AhRR (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.04, 2.00). Our findings demonstrate that urinary 1-hydroxypyrene may be a useful biomarker for evaluating the role of PAHs exposure on hypomethylation of LINE-1 among coke oven workers and that smoking may be an important factor affecting hypomethylation of AhRR.",

     "publication date": "02-2018",
     "abstract": "Guanine-quadruplexes (G4) are stable tetra-stranded DNA structures that may cause DNA replication stress and inhibit gene expression. Defects in unwinding these structures by DNA helicases may result in telomere shortening and DNA damage. Furthermore, due to mutations in WRN helicase genes in Werner syndrome, G4 motifs are likely to be key elements in the expression of premature aging phenotypes. The methylation of DNA plays a significant role in the stability and occurrence of G4. Thus, G4 frequency and DNA methylation mechanisms may be affected by excesses or deficiencies in methyl donors such as folate. B-Lymphocytes from Werner patients (n\u202f=\u202f5) and healthy individuals (n\u202f=\u202f5) were cultured in RPMI medium under condition of folate deficiency (20\u202fnM) or sufficiency (200\u202fnM) for 14 days. Cells were fixed on microscope slides for immunofluorescent staining to measure G4 frequency and \u03b3H2AX (a marker of DNA strand breaks) intensity, using automated quantitative imaging fluorescent microscopy. There was a significant increase (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) in G4 levels in Werner syndrome patients compared to healthy controls. Werner and control cells grown in 20\u202fnM folate media also showed significant increases in G4 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and \u03b3H2AX (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) signals compared with the same cells grown in 200\u202fnM folate. Control cells grown in 20\u202fnM folate also showed a significant reduction in DNA methylation levels (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The results of this study suggest that the occurrence of DNA G4 structures can be modulated in vitro via nutrients with important roles in methylation.",

     "abstract": "In vitro models are emerging tools for reducing reliance on traditional toxicity tests, especially in areas where information is sparse. For studies of fish, this is especially important for extrahepatic organs, such as the intestine, which, until recently, have been largely overlooked in favour of the liver or gill. Considering the importance of dietary uptake of contaminants, the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) intestine-derived cell line RTgutGC was cultured, to test its suitability as a high-throughput in vitro model. Benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) is an important contaminant and a model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH). Over 48\u202fh exposure, a range of endpoints and xenobiotic metabolism rates were examined at three different pH levels indicative of the in vitro (pH 7.5) and in vivo mid-gut (pH 7.7) and hind-gut (pH 7.4) regions as a function of time. These endpoints included (i) cell viability: acid phosphatase (APH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays; (ii) glucose uptake; (iii) cytochrome P450 enzyme activity: 7-ethoxyresoorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay; (iv) glutathione transferase (GST) activity; (v) genotoxic damage determined using the comet assay. Absence of cell viability loss, in parallel with decrease in the parent compound (B[a]P) in the medium and its subsequent increase in the cells suggested active sequestration, biotransformation, and removal of this representative PAH. With respect to genotoxic response, significant differences were observed at both the sampling times and the two highest concentrations of B[a]P. No significant differences were observed for the different pH conditions. Overall, this in vitro xenobiotic metabolism system appears to be a robust model, providing a basis for further development to evaluate metabolic and toxicological potential of contaminants without use of animals.",

Secondary aim of this study was also to assess whether a relation exists between endocrine hormones and the genome damage in acute OPs poisoning. In the study, blood samples were analysed of 13 patients before and after treatment admitted to the Department of Intensive Care Unit with acute OPs poisoning and of 13 healthy subjects of similar age and sex. The present study demonstrates that genome damage (micronucleus; MN and nucleoplasmic bridges; NPBs frequencies), apoptotic and necrotic cell frequencies increased in lymphocytes of patients with acute OPs poisoning before treatment and decreased after treatment. The present study also show that CBMN cyt assay parameters and 8-OHdG levels could be affected by some endocrine hormones such as E2, fT3, fT4, GH, IGF-1, FSH, LH, TSH, PRL, but not be related to ACTH and tT levels in acute OPs poisoning. In conclusion, it is believed that this is the first study to evaluate the chromosomal/oxidative DNA damage, cell proliferation, cell death and their associations with endocrine hormones in acute OPs poisoning. These preliminary findings need to be supported by further studies with larger sample sizes.",

     "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic phytoalexin possessing numerous health-promoting effects. Chromosomal instability (CIN), usually results from defective spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), is a major contributor to many diseases. While it\u2019s recently recognized that RSV exhibits a nonlinear dose response for disease prevention, whether it\u2019s the case for its role in CIN remains unknown. Here, we investigated the potential of a broad range of RSV concentrations (0.01\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcM) on CIN and the underlying mechanisms in human normal colon epithelial NCM460 cells. CIN was measured by cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay; mitotic fidelity was determined by aberrant mitosis analysis; SAC activity was assessed by nocodazole-challenge assay, and the expression of SAC genes was examined by RT-qPCR. We found that 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM RSV significantly reduced CIN (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), while 100\u00a0\u03bcM RSV significantly induced it (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Mitotic infidelity was significantly prevented by 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM RSV but promoted by 100\u00a0\u03bcM RSV (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for both). Moreover, the function of SAC was sustained and impaired by 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM and 100\u00a0\u03bcM RSV, respectively. Several SAC genes, including Aurora-B, Aurora-C, Plk-1 and CENP-E, were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated by 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM and 100\u00a0\u03bcM RSV, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, RSV exhibited a biphasic dose-dependent effect on CIN that was exerted via the regulation of mitotic fidelity through the SAC network.

In the present work, two new 3-APAs analogues were synthesized based on molecular modeling studies to act as potential antimalarial agents. These theoneladin C analogues, containing the thiocyanate group in their chemical structures, were synthesized and evaluated against Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 values ranging from 2.3 to 5.5\u00a0\u03bcM). The structural and energetic analysis demonstrated a high chemical affinity of the two analogues for their target, the heme group. However, despite the good antimalarial activity, the compounds exhibited high cytotoxicity and a lack of selectivity for human cell lines. These findings prompted us to evaluate the cytotoxicity of these compounds against human cancer cell lines. In order to better understand the mechanisms responsible for the toxicity, a variety of genotoxicity assays were performed in vitro. One of the compounds assayed presented an interesting selectivity and high toxicity to the human colon cancer cell line RKO-AS45-1. In addition, the results of the micronucleus assay, comet assay, Ames assay and annexin-V/propidium iodide staining showed that the synthetic alkaloids were able to induce chromosomal mis-segregation and trigger cell death by apoptosis.

The goal of a HESI Genetic Toxicology Technical Committee (GTTC) workgroup was to collect data from participating laboratories and to conduct a statistical analysis to understand and publish the range of values that are normally seen in experienced laboratories using TK6 cells to conduct the in vitro micronucleus assay. Data from negative control samples from in vitro micronucleus assays using TK6 cells from 13 laboratories were collected using a standard collection form. Although in some cases statistically significant differences can be seen within laboratories for different test conditions, they were very small. The mean incidence of micronucleated cells/1000 cells ranged from 3.2/1000 to 13.8/1000. These almost four-fold differences in micronucleus levels cannot be explained by differences in scoring method, presence or absence of exogenous metabolic activation (S9), length of treatment, presence or absence of cytochalasin B or different solvents used as vehicles. The range of means from the four laboratories using flow cytometry methods (3.7-fold: 3.5\u201312.9 micronucleated cells/1000 cells) was similar to that from the nine laboratories using other scoring methods (4.3-fold: 3.2\u201313.8 micronucleated cells/1000 cells). No laboratory could be identified as an outlier or as showing unacceptably high variability.Quality Control (QC) methods applied to analyse the intra-laboratory variability showed that there was evidence of inter-experimental variability greater than would be expected by chance (i.e. over-dispersion). However, in general, this was low.This study demonstrates the value of QC methods in helping to analyse the reproducibility of results, building up a \u2018normal\u2019 range of values, and as an aid to identify variability within a laboratory in order to implement processes to maintain and improve uniformity.",

     "abstract": "The liver\u2019s role in metabolism of chemicals makes it an appropriate tissue for toxicity testing. Current testing protocols, such as animal testing and two-dimensional liver cell systems, offer limited resemblance to in vivo liver cell behaviour, in terms of gene expression profiles and metabolic competence; thus, they do not always accurately predict human toxicology. In vitro three-dimensional liver cell models offer an attractive alternative. This study reports on the development of a 3D liver model, using HepG2 cells, by a hanging-drop technique, with a focus on evaluating spheroid growth characteristics and suitability for genotoxicity testing. The cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus assay protocol was adapted to enable micronucleus (MN) detection in the 3D spheroid models. This involved evaluating the difference between hanging vs non-hanging drop positions for dosing of the test agents and comparison of automated Metafer scoring with manual scoring for MN detection in HepG2 spheroids. The initial seeding density, used for all experiments, was 5000 cells/20\u202f\u03bcl drop hanging spheroids, harvested on day 4, with >75% cell viability. Albumin secretion (7.8\u202fg/l) and both CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 gene expression were highest in the 3D environment at day 4. Exposure to metabolically activated genotoxicants for 24\u202fh resulted in a 6-fold increase in CYP1A1 enzyme activity (3\u202f\u03bcM B[a]P) and a 30-fold increase in CYP1A2 enzyme activity (5\u202f\u03bcM PhIP) in 3D hanging spheroids. MN inductions in response to B[a]P or PhIP were 2-fold and 3-fold, respectively, and were greater in 3D hanging spheroids than in 2D format, showing that hanging spheroids are more sensitive to genotoxic agents. HepG2 hanging-drop spheroids are an exciting new alternative system for genotoxicity studies, due to their improved structural and physiological properties, relative to 2D cultures.",

However, the outcome of the multi-center cytogenetic screening conducted at that time remains unknown and no follow-up studies on the long-term effects of MIC exposure have been published. The present work examines genetic changes in the exposed population,with the aim of identifying any long-term effects of MIC. G-Banded metaphases were studied in lymphocytes of 130 individuals. Chromosomal aberrations (CA) were broadly grouped as abnormal cells (Abc), aberrations (Abn), and aberration/abnormal cell (Abn/Abc). From the previous multi-center screening, 946 records were retrieved, from which CA, sister chromatid exchanges (SCE), and cell-cycle kinetics (RI) were computed. In our analysis of the previous study, Abc and Abn were higher in the moderately and severely exposed groups than in the unexposed population. Abc appeared uniform in all groups of the present study, although Abn and Abn/Abc were higher in the exposed groups. Aberrations were now significantly higher in the unexposed and moderately exposed groups than in the previous screening. Although Abn and Abc now appeared lower in severely exposed subjects, the Abn/Abc ratio was higher, perhaps due to more rearrangements and damage in a smaller number of Abc. This result may be attributed to differences between the methods used in the studies, then and now. Elevated SCEs and reduced RI were seen in the severely exposed population shortly after exposure, and stable/clonal rearrangements were seen 30 y later. Follow-up of index cases and their progenies is needed.",

Cord plasma activity of superoxide dismutase was significantly lower in preterm infants (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). However, there were no significant differences in the cord blood total antioxidant capacity, catalase activity and malondialdehyde in preterm and term infants. Among the oxidative stress markers, the malondialdehyde concentration showed the strongest effect size (1.54; 95%CI: 0.9\u20132.17). For comet parameters, the most powerful effect size was observed for tail length (5.24; 95% CI: 4.05\u20136.42). However, tail DNA percent and tail moment were also significantly higher in cases compared to controls. Significant negative correlation was observed between comet assay parameters and birth weight and gestational age when all cases and controls entered into the analysis. There was no significant association between the levels of oxidative stress markers and early DNA damage in cord blood plasma with future nutritional tolerance in preterm infants.In the present study, the primary DNA damage and plasma oxidative stress markers significantly were increased in a preterm group. Preterm babies are more prone to the outcomes related to the early DNA damage. Tail DNA percent does not depend on experimental conditions as other parameters (tail length and thus also tail moment) and can be used for comparison with other studies.",

In this study, we demonstrate that Ag-np treatment trigger the activation of DNA-PKcs and JNK pathway at selected doses, presumably as a physiologic response to DNA damage and repair in normal and malignant cells. Ag-np altered the telomere dynamics by disrupting the shelterin complex located at the telomeres and telomere lengths. The genotoxic effect of Ag-np was not restricted to telomeres but the entire genome as Ag-np induced \u03b3-H2AX foci formation, an indicator of global DNA damage. Inhibition of DNA-PKcs activity sensitised the cancer cells towards the cytotoxicity of Ag-np and substantiated the damaging effect of Ag-np at telomeres in human cancer cells. Abrogation of JNK mediated DNA repair and extensive damage of telomeres led to greater cell death following Ag-np treatment in DNA-PKcs inhibited cancer cells. Collectively, this study suggests that improved anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of Ag-np treatment in cancer cells can be achieved by the inhibition of DNA-PKcs.",

There is no formal framework from the U.S. EPA for determining whether environmental chemicals act through a mutagenic or non-mutagenic MOA; consequently, most such determinations are made on an ad hoc basis. Eastmond [Mutat Res 751 (2012)] recently conducted a systematic investigation of MOA determinations by U.S. and international regulatory agencies and organizations, and identified ten major factors that influence them, including toxicokinetics, in vivo genotoxicity in target organs, data quality, and evidence for alternative MOAs. We have used these ten factors to evaluate mutagenic vs. non-mutagenic MOA for gastrointestinal tumors induced by oral exposure to hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)]. We also highlight similarities between Cr(VI) and other intestinal carcinogens previously determined to have non-genotoxic MOAs. Based on these analyses, we conclude that the MOA for Cr(VI) induced gastrointestinal tumors is non-mutagenic and that threshold risk assessment approaches are appropriate.",

However, evidence suggested that PB could be associated with the Gulf War Illness characterised by the presence of fatigue, headaches, cognitive dysfunction, and musculoskeletal respiratory and gastrointestinal disturbances. Given that a potential neurotoxic effect of PB has not yet been completely elucidated, the present investigation used neural SH-SY5Y cells to evaluate the effect of PB on the cellular viability, cell apoptosis, modulation of the cell cycle, oxidative stress, and genotoxicity variables, which indicate neurodegeneration. As expected, a PB concentration curve based on the therapeutic dose of the drug showed an inhibition of the AChE activity. However, this effect was transient and did not involve differential AChE gene regulation by PB. These results confirmed that undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells can be used as a cholinergic in vitro model. In general, PB did not trigger oxidative stress, and at a slightly higher PB concentration (80\u00a0ng/mL), higher levels of protein carbonylation and DNA damage were detected, as determined by the marker 8-deoxyguanosine. The PB genotoxic effects at 80\u00a0ng/mL were confirmed by the upregulation of the p53 and DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) genes, which are associated with cellular DNA repair. PB at 40\u00a0ng/mL, which is the minimal therapeutic dose, led to higher cell proliferation and mitochondrial activity compared with the control group. The effects of PB were corroborated by the upregulation of the telomerase gene. In summary, despite the methodological constrains related to the in vitro protocols, our results suggested that exposure of neural cells to PB, without other chemical and physical stressors did not cause extensive toxicity or indicate any neurodegeneration patterns.",

Analogously, the potential role of Aluminum (Al) in neurodegeneration is a matter of controversial debate. As all living organisms are exposed to ELF-MF and/or Al daily, we found investigating the early effects of co-exposure to ELF-MF and Al in SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE-2 human neuroblastoma (NB) cells intriguing.SH-SY5Y5 and SK-N-BE-2 cells underwent exposure to 50\u00a0Hz ELF-MF (0.01, 0.1 or 1\u00a0mT) or AlCl3 (4 or 40\u00a0\u03bcM) or co-exposure to 50\u00a0Hz ELF-MF and AlCl3 for 1\u00a0h continuously or 5\u00a0h intermittently. The effects of the treatment were evaluated in terms of DNA damage, redox status changes and Hsp70 expression. The DNA damage was assessed by Comet assay; the cellular redox status was investigated by measuring the amount of reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) while the inducible Hsp70 expression was evaluated by western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR.Neither exposure to ELF-MF or AlCl3 alone induced DNA damage, changes in GSH/GSSG ratio or variations in Hsp70 expression with respect to the controls in both NB cell lines. Similarly, co-exposure to ELF-MF and AlCl3 did not have any synergic toxic effects.The results of this in vitro study, which deals with the effects of co-exposure to 50\u00a0Hz MF and Aluminum, seem to exclude that short-term exposure to ELF-MF in combination with Al can have harmful effects on human SH-SY5Y and SK-N-BE-2 cells.",

This study aims to evaluate the ability of four different SAS, two precipitated, NM-200 and NM-201, and two pyrogenic, NM-202 and NM-203, to induce the transformation process. For this, we used the recently developed in vitro Bhas 42 cell transformation assay (CTA). The genome of the transgenic Bhas 42 cells contains several copies of the v-Ha-ras gene, making them particularly sensitive to tumor-promoter agents. The Bhas 42 CTA, which includes an initiation assay and a promotion assay, was validated in our laboratory using known soluble carcinogenic substances. Its suitability for particle-type substances was verified by using quartz Min-U-Sil 5 (Min-U-Sil) and diatomaceous earth (DE) microparticles. As expected given their known transforming properties, Min-U-Sil responded positively in the Bhas 42 CTA and DE responded negatively. Transformation assays were performed with SAS at concentrations ranging from 2\u00a0\u03bcg/cm2 to 80\u00a0\u03bcg/cm2. Results showed that all SAS have the capacity to induce transformed foci, interestingly only in the promotion assay, suggesting a mode of action similar to tumor-promoter substances. NM-203 exhibited transforming activity at a lower concentration than the other SAS. In conclusion, this study showed for the first time the transforming potential of different SAS, which act as tumor-promoter substances in the Bhas 42 model of cell transformation.",

Muta\u2122Mouse adult females were exposed to 36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 or 109\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse of Mitsui-7, or 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02 or 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcg/mouse of NM-401, once a week for four consecutive weeks via intratracheal instillations, alongside vehicle-treated controls. Samples were collected 90\u00a0days following the first exposure for measurement of DNA strand breaks, lacZ mutant frequency, p53 expression, cell proliferation, lung inflammation, histopathology, and changes in global gene expression. Both MWCNT types persisted in lung tissues 90\u00a0days post-exposure, and induced lung inflammation and fibrosis to similar extents. However, there was no evidence of DNA damage as measured by the comet assay following Mitsui-7 exposure, or increases in lacZ mutant frequency, for either MWCNTs. Increased p53 expression was observed in the fibrotic foci induced by both MWCNTs. Gene expression analysis revealed perturbations of a number of biological processes associated with cancer including cell death, cell proliferation, free radical scavenging, and others in both groups, with the largest response in NM-401-treated mice. The results suggest that if the two MWCNT types were capable of inducing DNA damage, strong adaptive responses mounted against the damage, resulting in efficient and timely elimination of damaged cells through cell death, may have prevented accumulation of DNA damage and mutations at the post-exposure time point investigated in the study. Thus, MWCNT-induced carcinogenesis may involve ongoing low levels of DNA damage in an environment of persisting fibres, chronic inflammation and tissue irritation, and parallel increases or decreases in the expression of genes involved in several pro-carcinogenic pathways.",

TFO as a carrier molecule for short-range particle emitter such as Auger-Electron-Emitters (AEE) bear the potential to introduce radiation-induced site-specific complex DNA lesions, which are known to induce chromosomal translocations. We studied gene expression, translocation frequency and protein expression in SCL-II cells after transfection with the AEE Iodine-125 (I-125) labeled TFO-BCL2 targeting the human BCL2 gene. The TFO-BCL2 binds to the BCL2 gene in close proximity to a known major-breakage-region (mbr). SCL-II cells were transfected with I-125 labeled TFO and stored for decay accumulation. Monitoring of BCL2 translocations was done with the Fluorescence-In-Situ-Hybridization (FISH) method. The utilized FISH probes were designed to detect a t(14;18) translocation of the BCL2 gene, which is a common translocation leading to an overexpression of BCL2 protein. Analysis of BCL2 gene expression levels was done via quantitative Real-Time PCR. Verification of gene expression on the protein level was analyzed by Western blotting. The relative gene expression of BCL2 in I-125-TFO-BCL2 transfected cells showed a significant up-regulation when compared to controls. Analysis of the BCL2 t(14;18) translocation frequency revealed a significant 1.8- to 2-fold increase when compared to control cells. This 2-fold increase was not reflected on the protein level. We conclude that I-125 decays within the BCL2 gene facilitate the t(14;18) chromosomal translocation in the SCL-II cells and that the increased frequency contributes to the observed overall enhanced BCL2 gene expression.",

These measurements allow a comparison of the contamination levels of soils and plants with equalized values.

We previously demonstrated that sesamin induces chromosomal aberrations (CA) in Chinese hamster lung (CHL/IU) cells in the presence of a metabolic activation system (S9 mix), although no genotoxicity was detected in vivo. To clarify the mechanism of CA induction by sesamin, we identified its principal active metabolite. A mono-catechol derivative, [2-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenyl)-6-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-3,7-dioxabi-cyclo[3.3.0]octane (SC-1)], was previously identified in culture medium when sesamin was incubated with S9 mix. In the present study, we show that SC-1 induces CA in CHL/IU cells but not in human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells. SC-1 was unstable in culture medium. Addition of glutathione (GSH) to the incubation mixture decreased the rate of decomposition and also suppressed induction of CA in CHL/IU cells. These results indicate that SC-1 itself may not contribute to the induction of CA. Two GSH adducts of SC-1 were identified when SC-1 was incubated with GSH, suggesting that SC-1 was converted to the semiquinone/quinone form and then conjugated with GSH in the culture medium. Sodium sulfite (a quinone-responsive compound) also suppressed CA induction by SC-1. These findings strongly suggest that SC-1 is oxidized to semiquinone/quinone derivatives extracellularly in culture medium, that these derivatives are responsible for the induction of CA in CHL/IU cells, and therefore that the positive results obtained with sesamin in in vitro CA tests using CHL/IU cells may not be relevant to the assessment of in vivo activity.",

Younger children in rural areas may also be affected by indirect pesticide exposures. The long-term effects of pesticides on health and development are difficult to assess and poorly understood. Yet, epidemiologic studies suggest associations with cancer as well as cognitive deficits. We report a practical and cost-effective approach to assess environmental pesticide exposures and their biological consequences in children. Our approach combines silicone wristband personal samplers and DNA damage quantification from hair follicles, and was tested as part of a community-based participatory research (CBPR) project involving ten Latino children from farmworker households in North Carolina. Our study documents high acceptance among Latino children and their caregivers of these noninvasive sampling methods. The personal samplers detected organophosphates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids in the majority of the participants (70%, 90%, 80%, respectively). Pesticides were detected in all participant samplers, with an average of 6.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4 detections/participant sampler. DNA damage in epithelial cells from the sheath and bulb of plucked hairs follicles was quantified by immunostaining 53BP1-labled DNA repair foci. This method is sensitive, as shown by dose response analyses to \u03b3 radiations where the lowest dose tested (0.1\u00a0Gy) led to significant increased 53BP1 foci density. Immunolabeling of DNA repair foci has significant advantages over the comet assay in that specific regions of the follicles can be analyzed. In this cohort of child participants, significant association was found between the number of pesticide detections and DNA damage in the papilla region of the hairs. We anticipate that this monitoring approach of bioavailable pesticides and genotoxicity will enhance our knowledge of the biological effects of pesticides to guide education programs and safety policies.",

The mortality rate, malformations, and DNA fragmentation in embryos exposed to silver nanoparticles increased in a dose- and embryonic stage-dependent manner. The total antioxidant capacity and the activity of catalase in embryos exposed to 25\u00a0ng/L silver nanoparticles were decreased significantly while the total antioxidant capacity and the activity of catalase were insignificantly increased with increasing concentrations in the embryos from 24 to 144 h-PFS exposed to 50 and 75\u00a0ng/L silver nanoparticles. Lipid peroxidation values showed fluctuations with doses of silver nanoparticles. Histopathological lesions including severely distorted and wrinkled notochord were observed. The current data propose that the toxicity of silver nanoparticles in C. gariepinus embryos is caused by oxidative stress and genotoxicity.",

Some publications have reported associations between EMF exposure and DNA damage, but many other studies contradict such findings. Cytomorphological changes, such as micronuclei (MN), indicative of genomic damage, are biomarkers of genotoxicity. To test whether mobile phone-associated EMF exposure affects the MN frequency in exfoliated buccal cells, we obtained cells smears from the left and right inner cheeks of healthy mobile phone users, aged 18\u201330 (n\u00a0=\u00a086), who also completed a characterization survey. MN frequencies were tested for potential confounding factors and for duration of phone use and preferential side of mobile phone use.No relationship was observed between MN frequency and duration of mobile phone use in daily calls. Cells ipsilateral to mobile phone use did not present a statistically significantly higher MN frequency, compared to cells contralateral to exposure. A highly statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) increase in MN frequency was found in subjects reporting regular exposure to genotoxic agents. Therefore, our results suggest that mobile phone-associated EMF do not to induce MN formation in buccal cells at the observed exposure levels.",

     "abstract": "Genotoxicity testing relies on the quantitative measurement of adverse effects, such as chromosome aberrations, micronuclei, and mutations, resulting from primary DNA damage. Ideally, assays will detect DNA damage and cellular responses with high sensitivity, reliability, and throughput. Several novel genotoxicity assays may fulfill these requirements, including the comet assay and the more recently developed \u03b3H2AX assay. Although they are thought to be specific for genotoxicants, a systematic comparison of the assays has not yet been undertaken. In the present study, we compare the \u03b3H2AX focus assay with the alkaline and neutral versions of the comet assay, as to their sensitivities and limitations for detection of genetic damage. We investigated the dose-response relationships of \u03b3H2AX foci and comet tail intensities at various times following treatment with four prototypical genotoxicants, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), N-methyl-N\u2019-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), mitomycin C, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and we tested whether there is a correlation between the endpoints, i.e., alkali-labile sites and DNA strand breaks on the one hand and the cell\u2019s response to DNA double-strand breaks and blocked replication forks on the other. Induction of \u03b3H2AX foci gave a linear dose response and all agents tested were positive in the assay. The increase in comet tail intensity was also a function of dose; however, mitomycin C was almost completely ineffective in the comet assay, and the doses needed to achieve a significant effect were somewhat higher for some treatments in the comet assay than in the \u03b3H2AX foci assay, which was confirmed by threshold analysis. There was high correlation between tail intensity and \u03b3H2AX foci for MMS and H2O2, less for MNNG, and none for mitomycin C. From this we infer that the \u03b3H2AX foci assay is more reliable, sensitive, and robust than the comet assay for detecting genotoxicant-induced DNA damage.",

Dose-dependent DNA damage and a dose-independent bystander response were seen after exposure to high dose and high dose-rate radiation. The level of induced damage (expression of p53ser15, \u03b3-H2AX) depended on ATM status. However, low dose and dose-rate exposures neither increased expression of marker proteins nor induced a bystander response, except in the CCRF-CEM cells.

We investigated the protective effect of apigenin against UVB-induced CPDs formation in human dermal fibroblasts cells (HDFa). For this purpose, HDFa cells were treated with apigenin (15\u00a0\u03bcM) prior to UVB irradiation (20\u00a0mJ/cm2); DNA damage and subsequent molecular end points were observed. Exposure to UVB radiation increased significant CPDs formation in HDFa cells and the frequencies of CPDs were reduced by treatment with apigenin (15\u00a0\u03bcM). UVB-induced CPDs downregulates the expression of nucleotide excision repair (NER) genes such as xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C, B, G and F (XPC, XPB, XPG and XPF), transcription factor II human (TFIIH) and excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1) in HDFa cells. Conversely, apigenin treatment restored UVB-induced loss of NER proteins in HDFa cells, which indicates its preventive effect against CPDs formation. Besides, single low dose UVB-exposure induced nuclear fragmentation, apoptotic frequency and apoptotic proteins expression (Bax and Caspase-3) have been prevented by the apigenin pretreatment. Furthermore, apigenin exhibits strong UV absorbance property and showed 10.08 SPF value. Thus, apigenin can protect skin cells against UVB-induced CPDs formation probably through its sunscreen effect. Hence, apigenin can be considered as an effective protective agent against UV induced skin damages.",

     "abstract": "Biochemical risk assessment studies of chemicals that induce DNA lesions are important, because lesions in genomic DNA frequently result in cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging in humans. Many classes of DNA lesions induced by chemical agents are eliminated via DNA repair mechanisms, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER), for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Individuals with NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), in which bulky DNA lesions are not efficiently removed, are cancer-prone and suffer neurodegeneration. For research into cancer and neurological diseases, therefore, it might be important to identify DNA damage from agents that induce NER-repairable bulky DNA lesions. However, simple and quick assays to detect such damaging agents have not been developed using human cells. Here, we report a simple, non-isotopic assay for determining DNA damaging agents that induce NER-repairable DNA lesions by visualizing gene expression from treated fluorescent protein vectors in a mammalian cell system. This assay is based on a comparison of fluorescent protein expression in NER-proficient and NER-deficient cells. When we tested UV-irradiated fluorescent protein vectors, the fluorescent protein was observed in NER-proficient cells, but not in NER-deficient cells. Similar results were obtained for vectors treated with the anticancer drug, cisplatin. In contrast, when treated with the DNA alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, believed to cause BER-repairable damage, no difference in gene expression between NER-proficient and NER-deficient cells was observed. These results suggest that our assay can specifically detect DNA-damaging agents that induce NER-repairable DNA lesions, and could be used to analyze chemicals with the potential to cause cancer and neurological diseases. With further validation, the assay might be also applicable to XP diagnosis.",

     "abstract": "The use of computed tomography (CT scans) has increased dramatically in recent decades, raising questions about the long-term safety of CT-emitted x-rays especially in infants who are more sensitive to radiation-induced effects. Cancer risk estimates for CT scans typically are extrapolated from models; therefore, new approaches measuring actual DNA damage are needed for improved estimations. Hence, changes in a dosimeter of DNA double-strand breaks, micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RETs) measured by flow cytometry, were investigated in mice and infants exposed to CT scans. In male C57BL/6N mice (6\u20138 weeks-of-age), there was a dose-related increase in MN-RETs in blood samples collected 48\u00a0h after CT scans delivering targeted exposures of 1\u2013130 cGy x-rays (n\u00a0=\u00a05-10/group, r\u00a0=\u00a00.994, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), with significant increases occurring at exposure levels as low as 0.83 cGy x-rays compared to control mice (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). In paired blood specimens from infants with no history of a prior CT scan, there was no difference in MN-RET frequencies found 2\u00a0h before (mean, 0.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07%) versus 48\u00a0h after (mean, 0.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05%) a scheduled CT scan/cardiac catheterization.

The particles were characterised by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV), Brunner-Emmett-Teller (BET), X- ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Genotoxicity was determined using comet assay in blood and liver and micronucleus test in bone marrow.

In the chemoprevention study, we evaluated the effects of CM and CA on the formation of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in male Wistar rat colon. Neither agent caused a significant increase in micronucleus frequency relative to controls, but the highest CM dose tested (400\u00a0mg/kg b.w.) caused DNA damage in the comet assay.

Hormetic, or J-shaped, dose-response relationships are relatively rarely observed in toxicology, resulting in a limited understanding and even some skepticism of the concept. Low dose-response studies for genotoxicity endpoints have been performed at Swansea University for over a decade. However, no statistically significant decreases below control genotoxicity levels have been detected until recently. A hormetic-style dose-response following a 24\u00a0h exposure to the alkylating agent N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was observed in a previous study for HPRT mutagenesis in the human lymphoblastoid cell line AHH-1. A second recent study demonstrated a J-shaped dose-response for the induction of micronuclei by MNU in a 24\u00a0h treatment in a similar test system. Following mechanistic investigations, it was hypothesized that p53 may be responsible for the observed hormetic phenomenon. As genotoxic carcinogens are a major causative factor of many cancers, consideration of hormesis in carcinogenesis could be important in safety assessment. The data examined here offer possible insights into hormesis, including its estimated prevalence, underlying mechanisms and lack of generalizability.",

However, highly unsaturated PUFA of marine and seed origin easily oxidize to aldehydic products which form DNA adducts. With increased PUFA consumption it is prudent to re-evaluate \u03c9-3 PUFA safety and the genotoxic hazards of their metabolites. We have used the standard Ames test to examine the mutagenicity of 2 hexenals derived from lipid peroxidation of the common \u03c9-3 PUFA in human diet and tissues. Both 4-hydroxyhexenal and 2-hexenal derived from the \u03c9-3 docosahexaenoic and \u03b1-linolenic acid, respectively, induced base substitutions in the TA104 and TA100 Ames strains in a dose dependent manner.

CB inhalation may cause chronic inflammation in the respiratory system, leading to carcinogenesis, but the mechanism remains unclear. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are generated from inflammatory and epithelial cells under inflammatory conditions, and resulting DNA damage may contribute to carcinogenesis. In this study, we performed immunocytochemistry to determine whether CB exposure induces formation of 8-nitroguanine (8-nitroG), a nitrative DNA lesion formed under inflammatory conditions, in RAW 264.7 macrophage and A549 lung epithelial cells. We compared the DNA-damaging effects of CB particles with primary diameter 56\u00a0nm (CB56) and 95\u00a0nm (CB95). Both types of CB induced 8-nitroG formation, mainly in the nucleus of RAW 264.7 and A549 cells, and CB95 tended to induce more 8-nitroG formation than did CB56. Flow cytometry revealed that CB95 generated larger amount of reactive oxygen species than did CB56 in RAW 264.7 cells. The Griess method showed that CB95 produced significantly larger amount of nitric oxide (NO) than did CB56. Flow cytometry showed that CB95 was more efficiently internalized into the cells than was CB56. The cellular uptake of CB and 8-nitroG formation in RAW 264.7 cells were reduced by monodansylcadaverine, an inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and by siRNA for Ctlc (clathrin heavy chain) gene.

     "abstract": "The Aristolochic Acid (AA)-specific mutational pattern was recently characterized in urothelial carcinoma (UC) from Belgian AA Nephropathy (AAN) patients (n\u00a0=\u00a05). Besides the A\u00a0>\u00a0T transversion hallmark, a specific AA-mutational pattern was found in the TP53 hotspot region in p53-positive immunohistochemistry (IHC) areas and consisted of poly- or multiclonal TP53 alterations and an unusual high prevalence of G\u00a0>\u00a0T transversion. In the current study, these data were complemented using the same validated methodology for assessing the complete coding sequence of the TP53 gene in tumor areas stratified according to the percentage of p53-stained cells (i.e., [+], \u226560%; [+/\u2212], 1\u201359%, [\u2212], no staining). Results were compared to existing data (i.e., other series of AA-associated UC and IARC TP53 database). Aside of the TP53 hotspot region (exons 5\u20138), multiple mutations were also found in exons 4 and 10. A unique TP53 mutational pattern was characterized by a large spectrum of mutations among which A\u00a0>\u00a0T and C\u00a0>\u00a0T have the highest prevalence. Most A\u00a0>\u00a0T mutations were characterized by the 5\u2032Py-A-Pu sequence. Interestingly, the majority of p53-negative areas were dysplastic (low grade intra-urothelial neoplasia) and disclosed TP53 mutations among which a majority of A\u00a0>\u00a0T transversions. Beside nonsense p53-negative mutations, several missense mutations are also known to affect p53 DNA- or zinc-binding domains, hence probably impairing the antigen binding site and/or masking the antigenic epitope. These uncommon histologic, immunopathologic and genetic features in Belgian AAN patients probably result from the unique pattern of duration and extent of AA exposure which led to a cumulative toxic dose ingested over a short period of time. Consequenlty, current results bring additional and valuable evidence unravelling the molecular pathogenesis of AA-induced carcinogenesis and the origin of related high-grade UCs.",

The polymorphisms were determined using conventional PCR and Sanger sequencing method. Results show that for the EPHX1 gene Y113H polymorphism, the presence of an \u201cC\u201d allele (TC/CC genotype) was significantly overrepresented in the COPD patients compared to the controls. For the TNF-a gene \u2212308G/A polymorphism, no significant difference was found between the two groups.

Recently, the use of brominated flame retardants has been restricted or prohibited under various legislative acts because of the persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicity of these compounds. However, there are also additional concerns regarding environmental contamination and human exposure to PBDEs resulting from informal recycling technology. Decabromodiphenyl ether (decaBDE), one type of PBDE, has carcinogenic potential in the livers of rodents. Although one study has shown that decaBDE exerts genotoxic effects, the other in vitro and in vivo studies were negative for such effects. Thus, it remains unknown whether genotoxic mechanisms are involved in decaBDE-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rodents. In this study, to explore the genotoxicity of decaBDE in mice, particularly in the context of carcinogenesis, we performed micronucleus assays in the bone marrow and reporter gene mutation assays in the liver using gpt delta mice treated with decaBDE at carcinogenic doses for 28\u00a0days. Our results demonstrated negative results in micronucleus tests and reporter gene mutation assays. Thus, decaBDE did not exert genotoxic effects at carcinogenic target sites and did not show positive results in conventional in vivo genotoxicity tests in mice for 4-week treatment. Overall, comprehensive evaluation using in vivo genotoxicity data in rats and our data indicated that nongenotoxic mechanisms may be responsible for decaBDE-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.",

Cells exposed to 2.5\u201340\u00a0\u03bcM cadmium exhibited a concentration-dependent decrease in survival which correlated with increases in PARP cleavage and caspase activity. Cytotoxicity was detected at intracellular cadmium concentrations of 12.9\u00a0ppb. Exposure to cadmium also resulted in the production of single and double strand breaks and the induction micronuclei and mutations in the Hprt gene.

Thus, we examined the potential induction of oxidative DNA damage by 2-NA using bacterial strain YG3008, a mutMST-deficient derivative of strain TA100. Consequently, strain YG3008, when compared with strain TA100, was found to be more sensitive to 2-NA, indicating oxidative DNA damage in bacterial cells. For further investigation, we performed the comet assay using the urinary bladder and liver of rats, with and without human 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1), to confirm the potential of 2-NA for inducing oxidative DNA damage. Simultaneously, we conducted a micronucleus test using bone marrow from rats to assess the genotoxicity of 2-NA in vivo. 2-NA was administered orally to male Fischer 344 rats for 3 consecutive days. The rats were divided into 6 treatment groups: 3 groups treated with 2-NA at doses of 125, 250, and 500\u00a0mg/kg; a group treated with the combination of 2-NA and glutathione-SH (GSH); a negative control group; and a positive control group. The comet assay without hOGG1 detected no DNA damage in the liver or urinary bladder, and the micronucleus test did not show clastogenic effects in bone marrow cells. However, the comet assay with hOGG1 was positive in the urinary bladder samples, indicating the induction of oxidative DNA damage in the urinary bladder for the group treated with 2-NA at 500\u00a0mg/kg. Moreover, an antioxidant of GSH significantly reduced oxidative DNA damage caused by 2-NA.

     "abstract": "End-stage renal disease patients present oxidative stress status that increases when they are submitted to hemodialysis (HD). This increase in oxidative stress can affect their genetic material, among other targets. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of using polysulfone membranes coated with vitamin E, during the HD sessions, on the levels of genetic damage of HD patients. Forty-six patients were followed for 6 months, of whom 29 changed from conventional HD to the use of membranes coated with vitamin E. The level of genetic damage was measured using the micronucleus and the comet assays, both before and after the follow-up period. Serum vitamin E concentration was also checked. The obtained results showed that 24% of our patients presented vitamin E deficiency, and this was normalized in those patients treated with vitamin E-coated membranes. Patients with vitamin E deficiency showed higher levels of oxidative DNA damage. After the use of vitamin E-coated membranes we detected a significant decrease in the levels of oxidative damage. Additionally, hemoglobin values increased significantly with the use of vitamin E-coated membranes. In conclusion, the use of vitamin E-coated membranes supposes a decrease on the levels of oxidative DNA damage, and improves the uremic anemia status. Furthermore, the use of this type of membrane was also effective in correcting vitamin E deficiency.",

     "abstract": "Alkylating agents are known to induce the formation of O6-alkylguanine (O6-alkG) and O4-alkylthymine (O4-alkT) in DNA. These lesions have been widely investigated as major sources of mutations. We previously showed that mismatch repair (MMR) facilitates the suppression of GC-to-AT mutations caused by O6-methylguanine more efficiently than the suppression of GC-to-AT mutations caused by O6-ethylguanine. However, the manner by which O4-alkyT lesions are repaired remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the repair pathway involved in the repair of O4-alkT. The E. coli CC106 strain, which harbors \u0394prolac in its genomic DNA and carries the F\u2019CC106 episome, can be used to detect AT-to-GC reverse-mutation of the gene encoding \u03b2-galactosidase. Such AT-to-GC mutations should be induced through the formation of O4-alkT at AT base pairs. As expected, an O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) -deficient CC106 strain, which is defective in both ada and agt genes, exhibited elevated mutant frequencies in the presence of methylating agents and ethylating agents. However, in the UvrA-deficient strain, the methylating agents were less mutagenic than in wild-type, while ethylating agents were more mutagenic than in wild-type, as observed with agents that induce O6-alkylguanine modifications. Unexpectedly, the mutant frequencies decreased in a MutS-deficient strain, and a similar tendency was observed in MutL- or MutH-deficient strains. Thus, MMR appears to promote mutation at AT base pairs. Similar results were obtained in experiments employing double-mutant strains harboring defects in both MMR and AGT, or MMR and NER. E. coli MMR enhances AT-to-GC mutagenesis, such as that caused by O4-alkylthymine. We hypothesize that the MutS protein recognizes the O4-alkT:A base pair more efficiently than O4-alkT:G. Such a distinction would result in misincorporation of G at the O4-alkT site, followed by higher mutation frequencies in wild-type cells, which have MutS protein, compared to MMR-deficient strains.",

Particular alleles of CYP1A1, such as CYP1A1 I462V have been correlated with a higher incidence of breast and lung cancer, but it is unknown whether these variants express enzymes in vivo that are more potent in generating genotoxins. We individually expressed CYP1A1 (CYP1A1.1), CYP1A1 T461N (CYP1A1.4) and I462V (CYP1A1.2) alleles in wild-type and DNA repair deficient mutant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) and asked which yeast strains exhibited the highest levels of carcinogen-associated genotoxicity after exposure to BaP-DHD, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), and heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs). We measured carcinogen-associated recombination, Rad51 foci, and carcinogen-associated toxicity in a DNA repair mutant deficient in both nucleotide excision repair and recombinational repair. CYP1A1 activity was confirmed by measuring ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylation (EROD) activities. Our data indicate that CYP1A1 I462V allele confers the least carcinogen-associated genotoxicity, compared to CYP1A1; however, results vary depending on the chemical carcinogen and the genotoxic endpoint. We speculate that the cancer-associated risk of CYP1A1 I462V may be caused by exposure to other xenobiotics.",

     "abstract": "The origins of human cancers remain unclear except for a limited number of potent environmental mutagens, such as tobacco and UV light, and in rare cases, familial germ line mutations that affect tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. A significant component of cancer etiology has been deemed stochastic and correlated with the number of stem cells in a tissue, the number of times the stem cells divide and a low incidence of random DNA polymerase errors that occur during each cell division. While somatic mutations occur during each round of DNA replication, mutations in cancer driver genes are not stochastic. Out of a total of 2843 codons, 1031 can be changed to stop codons by a single base substitution in the tumor suppressor APC gene, which is mutated in 76% of colorectal cancers (CRC). However, the nonsense mutations, which comprise 65% of all the APC driver mutations in CRC, are not random: 43% occur at Arg CGA codons, although they represent <3% of the codons. In TP53, CGA codons comprise <3% of the total 393 codons but they account for 72% and 39% of the mutations in CRC and ovarian cancer OVC, respectively. This mutation pattern is consistent with the kinetically slow, but not stochastic, hydrolytic deamination of 5-methylcytosine residues at specific methylated CpG sites to afford T\u00b7G mismatches that lead to C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T transitions and stop codons at CGA. Analysis of nonsense mutations in CRC, OVC and a number of other cancers indicates the need to expand the predictable risk factors for cancer to include, in addition to random polymerase errors, the methylation status of gene body CGA codons in tumor suppressor genes.",

Non-smoking, low-risk alcohol-drinking healthy Korean men and women aged 30 to 59 years were recruited.

The frequencies of BN cells with MNi in men were 14.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) in 30\u201339\u00a0year olds, 20.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1 in 40\u201349\u00a0year olds, and 21.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.6 in 50\u201359\u00a0year olds.

Based on a regression analysis of the CBMN-Cyt parameters, MNi frequencies showed a positive relationship with age for both genders. BMI and blood vitamin B concentration were not significantly associated with CBMN-Cyt parameters, except vitamin B6 levels, which were positively associated with MNi scores in males. These results provide the standard frequencies of MNi, NPBs, and NBUDs in peripheral blood lymphocytes in middle-aged Korean individuals with healthy lifestyles. In this group, CBMN-Cyt assay parameters varied according to gender and age; however, BMI and micronutrient levels were not significantly associated with assay parameters.",

Recent studies showing that IM can induce DNA and chromosomal damage in crustaceans and higher plants prompted us to re-examine its potential genotoxicity. IM was not mutagenic in the Ames assay (Salmonella typhimurium). Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated in vitro in zebrafish (Danio rerio) liver (ZFL), human hepatoma (HepG2), and human peripheral blood lymphocyte (HPBL) cells. Genotoxicity was determined with the comet assay and with the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay. ZFL and HPBL cells showed comparable sensitivity to IM cytotoxicity, while HepG2 cells were less sensitive. At non-cytotoxic concentrations, IM induced DNA strand breaks in ZFL and HepG2 cells. An increase in the number of micronuclei was observed in ZFL and HPBL cells. In HPBLs, IM also induced an increase in the number of nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds. Based on the data of the consumption of IM in European countries the predicted environmental concentrations (PEC) were calculated to be in the range between 3.3 and 5.0\u00a0ng/L, which are several orders of magnitude lower from those that caused adverse effects in fish and human derived cells. However, based on the in vitro studies it is not possible to quantitatively predict the hazard for wildlife and humans, therefore further studies are warranted to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of induced IM genotoxic effects as well as the studies of the occurrence of IM in the aquatic and occupational environment to establish the relevance of these observations for aquatic organisms and occupationally exposed personnel.",

It has been reported that activation of the NRF2 pathway confers cells with resistance to ionizing radiation-induced damage. However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In the current research, it was found that \u03b1-particle radiation has the ability to stimulate NRF2 expression in human osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells. Knockdown of cellular NRF2 level by shRNA-mediated gene silencing decreased the survival rate, increased the micronucleus formation rate and apoptosis rate in irradiated cells. Consistently, knockdown of NRF2 resulted in decreased expression of p65 and Bcl-2, and increased expression of p53 and Bax. Besides, it was observed that increased expression of NRF2 was partially dependent on radiation induced phosphorylation of ERK 1/2. Further results showed that radiation promoted autophagy flux which leads to the enhanced phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, as evidenced by the resultls that knockdown of ATG5 (Autophagy protein 5) gene by shRNA suppressed both radiation induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation and NRF2 upregulation. Based on these results, it is proposed that attenuation of NRF2 antioxidative pathway can sensitize U-2 OS cells to radiation, where NRF2 antioxidative response is regulated by autophagy mediated activation of ERK 1/2 kinases.",

A recent study showed that chronic restraint-induced PS (CRIPS) diminished the functions of Trp53 and enhanced radiocarcinogenesis in Trp53-heterozygous (Trp53+/\u2212) mice. These findings had a marked impact on the academic field as well as the general public, particularly among residents living in areas radioactively contaminated by nuclear accidents. In an attempt to elucidate the modifying effects of CRIPS on radiation-induced health consequences in Trp53 wild-type (Trp53+/+) animals, investigations involving multidisciplinary analyses were performed. We herein demonstrated that CRIPS induced changes in the frequency of IR-induced chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in splenocytes. Five-week-old male Trp53+/+ C57BL/6J mice were restrained for 6\u00a0h per day for 28 consecutive days, and total body irradiation (TBI) at a dose of 4\u00a0Gy was performed on the 8th day. Metaphase chromosome spreads prepared from splenocytes at the end of the 28-day restraint regimen were painted with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes for chromosomes 1, 2, and 3. The results obtained showed that CRIPS alone did not induce CAs, while TBI caused significant increases in CAs, mostly translocations. Translocations appeared at a lower frequency in mice exposed to TBI plus CRIPS than in those exposed to TBI alone. No significant differences were observed in the frequencies of the other types of CAs (insertions, dicentrics, and fragments) visualized with FISH between these experimental groups (TBI\u00a0+\u00a0CRIPS vs. TBI). These results suggest that CRIPS does not appear to synergize with the clastogenicity of IR.",

Methylation (5\u00a0mC) of long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1) and DNA repair gene (OGG1, APEX, and PARP1) was assessed by pyrosequencing in peripheral mononuclear cells, DNA damage by comet assay and DNA oxidation by 8-OHdG content.

However, data about the genotoxicity of DBPs is limited to only a small fraction of compounds. Chloral hydrate (CH) and bromal hydrate (BH) are two trihaloacetaldehydes commonly detected in disinfected waters, but little is known about their genotoxicity, especially BH.We investigated the genotoxicity of CH and BH using a test battery that includes three in vitro genotoxicity assays.We conducted the Ames test using Salmonella bacterial strains TA97a, TA98, TA100 and TA102, and the alkaline comet assay and the micronucleus test both using Chinese hamster ovary cells. We carried out the tests in the absence and presence of the metabolic fraction S9 mix.CH did not exhibit statistically significant genotoxic effects in any of the three assays. In contrast, BH exhibited mutagenic activity in the Salmonella strain TA100 and induced statistically significant DNA lesions in CHO cells as appeared in the comet assay. The genotoxic potential of BH in both assays decreased in the presence of the metabolic fraction S9 mix. BH did not induce chromosomal damage in CHO cells.Our results show that BH exhibited genotoxic activity by causing mutations and primary DNA damage while CH did not induce genotoxic effects. Our findings highlight concerns about the higher genotoxicity of brominated DBPs in comparison to their chlorinated analogues.",

Samples were collected in three different sites of S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, and fifteen soluble metals and the sixteen EP\u00c1s priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were chemically determined. PAHs prevailing were fluoranthene and benzo(ghi)perylene. In the water-soluble extracts, highest concentration of metals was found for zinc, iron, and copper in all places of collection. Although PM10 concentration in all samples was in the range of 33.5\u2013110.1\u00a0\u03bcg/m3, lower than 120\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 (limit established by S\u00e3o Paulo State\u2019s legislation for PM10 in 24\u00a0h), MN results showed that of the 24 samples analyzed, five organic and seven water-soluble extracts presented a significant increase in MN frequency. The frequency of MN correlates with the total PAH concentration of the three sites investigated, and the concentration of PM10 is correlated with the biological effect in two of them. For the water-soluble fraction, all the sites presented a relation between the PM10 concentration and the MN frequency. Again, the genotoxic response showed a correlation with the total concentration of water-soluble metals in two of the three sites. Our results confirm the importance of the soluble fraction of PM10 to the genotoxic effect of airborne PM even at low concentration of water-soluble compounds. Thus, together with chemical analysis, the implementation of the MN protocol for both organic and water-soluble fraction biological monitoring could be used as a strategy in a routine air-quality monitoring program, complementing other usual analyses for air pollution control and protection of populations.",

Spinosad-induced p53 accumulation thereby upregulates the expression of Bax and downregulates the expression of Bcl-2. Further studies confirmed that spinosad induced apoptosis in HEK293 and HepG2 cells, accompanied by a dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in caspase-3 activity. The alkaline comet assay and \u03b3-H2AX foci staining revealed that spinosad induced significant concentration-dependent increases of DNA strand breaks in HEK293 and HepG2 cells.

Treatment with mutagens did not change the characteristic S-phase patterns in the nuclei; however, the frequencies of the S-phase-labelled cells after treatment differed from those observed in the control cells. The analyses of DNA replication in barley nuclei were extended to the micronuclei induced by mutagens. Replication in the chromatin of the micronuclei was rare. The results of simultanous TUNEL reaction to identify cells with DNA strand breaks and the labelling of the S-phase cells with EdU revealed the possibility of DNA replication occurring in damaged nuclei.

Results obtained were compared to those for the mainstream smoke from a Kentucky reference (3R4F) cigarette. Two different test matrices were assessed. Aerosol generated from the e-cigarette was trapped on a Cambridge filter pad, eluted in DMSO and compared to cigarette smoke total particulate matter (TPM), which was generated in the same manner for mutagenicity assessment in the Salmonella assay. Fresh e-cigarette and cigarette smoke aerosols were generated on the Vitrocell\u00ae VC 10 smoking robot and compared using a modified scaled-down 35\u00a0mm air agar interface (AAI) methodology.E-cigarette aerosol collected matter (ACM) was found to be non-mutagenic in the 85\u00a0mm plate incorporation Ames assay in strains TA98 and TA100 conducted in accordance with OECD 471, when tested up to 2400\u00a0\u03bcg/plate. Freshly generated e-cigarette aerosol was also found to be negative in both strains after an AAI aerosol exposure, when tested up to a 1\u00a0L/min dilution for up to 3\u00a0h. Positive control responses were observed in both strains, using benzo[a]pyrene, 2-nitrofluorene, sodium azide and 2-aminoanthracene in TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of metabolic activation respectively. In contrast, cigarette smoke TPM and aerosol from 3R4F reference cigarettes were found to be mutagenic in both tester strains, under comparable test conditions to that of e-cigarette exposure.Limited information exists on the mutagenic activity of captured e-cigarette particulates and whole aerosol AAI approaches. With the lower toxicant burden of e-cigarette aerosols compared to cigarette smoke, it is clear that a more comprehensive Ames package of data should be generated when assessing e-cigarettes, consisting of the standard OECD-five, TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 (or TA97) and E. coli (or TA102). In addition, TA104 which is more sensitive to the carbonyl based compounds found in e-cigarette aerosols under dry-wicking conditions may also prove a useful addition in a testing battery. Regulatory standard product testing approaches as used in this study will become important when determining whether e-cigarette aerosols are in fact less biologically active than cigarette smoke, as this study suggests. Future studies should be supported by in vitro dosimetry approaches to draw more accurate comparisons between cigarette smoke, e-cigarette aerosol exposure and human use.",

DNA damage in cells caused by BPDE is normally repaired by Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) and Base Excision Repair (BER). Genetic variations in NER and BER can change individual DNA repair capacity to DNA damage induced by BPDE. In the present study we determined the number of in vitro induced BPDE-DNA adducts in lymphocytes, to reflect individual susceptibility to Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)-induced carcinogenesis. The BPDE-DNA adduct level in lymphocytes were assessed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 281 randomly selected participants. We genotyped for 9 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in NER (XPB rs4150441, XPC rs2228001, rs2279017 and XPF rs4781560), BER (XRCC1 rs25487, rs25489 and rs1799782) and genes located on chromosome 19q13.2-3 (PPP1R13L rs1005165 and CAST rs967591). We found that 3 polymorphisms in chromosome 19q13.2-3 were associated with lower levels of BPDE-DNA adducts (Minor\u00a0T allele in XRCC1 rs1799782, minor T allele in PPP1R13L rs1005165 and minor A allele in CAST rs967571). In addition, a modified comet assay was performed to further confirm the above conclusions. We found both minor T allele in PPP1R13L rs1005165 and minor A allele in CAST rs967571 were associated with the lower levels of BPDE-adducts. Our data suggested that the variant genotypes of genes in chromosome 19q13.2-3 are associated with the alteration of repair efficiency to DNA damage caused by Benzo[a]pyrene, and may contribute to enhance predictive value for individual\u2019s DNA repair capacity in response to environmental carcinogens.",

     "abstract": "The in vivo mutation assay using the X-linked phosphatidylinositol glycan class A gene (Pig-a in rodents, PIG-A in humans) is a promising tool for evaluating the mutagenicity of chemicals. Approaches for measuring Pig-a mutant cells have focused on peripheral red blood cells (RBCs) and reticulocytes (RETs) from rodents. The recently developed PIGRET assay is capable of screening >1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 RETs for Pig-a mutants by concentrating RETs in whole blood prior to flow cytometric analysis. Additionally, due to the characteristics of erythropoiesis, the PIGRET assay can potentially detect increases in Pig-a mutant frequency (MF) sooner after exposure compared with a Pig-a assay targeting total RBCs (RBC Pig-a assay). In order to test the merits and limitations of the PIGRET assay as a short-term genotoxicity test, an interlaboratory trial involving 16 laboratories was organized by the Mammalian Mutagenicity Study Group of the Japanese Environmental Mutagenicity Society (MMS/JEMS). First, the technical proficiency of the laboratories and transferability of the assay were confirmed by performing both the PIGRET and RBC Pig-a assays on rats treated with single doses of N-nitroso-N-ethylurea. Next, the collaborating laboratories used the PIGRET and RBC Pig-a assays to assess the mutagenicity of a total of 24 chemicals in rats, using a single treatment design and mutant analysis at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after the treatment. Thirteen chemicals produced positive responses in the PIGRET assay; three of these chemicals were not detected in the RBC Pig-a assay. Twelve chemicals induced an increase in RET Pig-a MF beginning 1 week after dosing, while only 3 chemicals positive for RBC Pig-a MF produced positive responses 1 week after dosing. Based on these results, we conclude that the PIGRET assay is useful as a short-term test for in vivo mutation using a single-dose protocol.",

As part of this study, we evaluated the genotoxicity of a single oral administration of acrylamide (AA) at 25, 50, 100, 137.5, and 175\u00a0mg/kg using the PIGRET and Pig-a assays targeting RBCs (RBC Pig-a assay) at 7, 14, and 28 days after dosing. Toxic effects induced by AA, such as hind limb weak-paralysis, reduction of body weight gain, and reticulocytosis, were observed in AA-treated groups. However, we detected no significant increases in Pig-a mutant frequencies using either the PIGRET or RBC Pig-a assay. Therefore, we concluded that the genotoxicity of AA could not be detected by these assays under our experimental conditions.",

The frequencies of Pig-a mutants in RBCs and reticulocytes (RET) were evaluated once a week for 4 weeks after the treatment. With a single exposure to ENU, the frequencies of Pig-a mutants in both RBCs and RETs increased in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In contrast, with Aza small effects that were not statistically significant were observed in rats at 21 and 14\u00a0days in the RBC Pig-a and PIGRET assays respectively.

Several reports showed that the PIGRET assay could detect the increase of Pig-a mutant frequency earlier than the Pig-a assay in total red blood cells (RBC Pig-a assay). Therefore, as part of a collaborative study by the Mammalian Mutagenicity Study (MMS) Group of the Japanese Environmental Mutagen Society, the usefulness of the PIGRET assay in comparison to the RBC Pig-a assay has been assessed for 24 compounds with various mechanisms of action. In the present study, we performed the PIGRET assay and RBC Pig-a assay with a nucleoside analogue, azidothymidine (AZT), and compared the results in these assays. We administered a single dose of AZT to rats by oral gavage up to 2000\u00a0mg/kg and examined Pig-a mutant frequencies at days 7, 14 and 28 by PIGRET and RBC Pig-a assays. No significant increases in mutant frequency were observed after administration of AZT in both the RBC Pig-a and PIGRET assays and comparable to the previous results of the International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing (IWGT) workgroup. AZT has been thought to induce not only DNA chain termination as a pharmacological effect but also a large deletion on the genome DNA. The Pig-a assays may be less sensitive to compounds such as AZT which induce large deletions on the genome DNA.",

The usefulness of the PIGRET assay as a short-term test has been confirmed in a collaborative study in Japan with 24 chemicals. One of these chemicals, diethylnitrosamine (DEN), which mainly induces liver tumors in both sexes of rats, was tested. To determine the appropriate doses, DEN was dissolved in physiological saline and administered orally with a single dose to male 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats in a preliminary dose-range finding study. As a result, all of the animals died at doses of 300 and 600\u00a0mg/kg. Therefore, 37.5, 75, and 150\u00a0mg/kg doses were set for the main study (the RBC Pig-a and PIGRET assays). The results showed no statistically significant increase in the mutant frequency (MF) of CD59-negative cells in the groups treated with DEN for the entire test period; however, the positive control N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) produced positive results. Some hematogenic effects were indicated by the significant increase of the percentage of reticulocytes in the medium and at high doses on Day 28. The decrease in the body weight on Days 2\u20134 in the main study and the mortality in the preliminary dose range-finding study indicated that appropriate doses were used in the main study. Although DEN is a known genotoxic carcinogen in the liver, our negative results in the RBC Pig-a and PIGRET assays indicated that there is no substantial mutagenicity in hematopoietic cells under the conditions using a single dose.

This assay is now recognized to be able to detect a number of mutagenic chemicals administered to rats in sub-acute or sub-chronic dose studies. The present investigation was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of peripheral blood Pig-a assays with total red blood cells (RBC Pig-a assay) and with reticulocytes (PIGRET assay) using two genotoxic rodent carcinogens, 1,3-propane sultone (1,3-PS) and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF).

In the experiment with 1,3-PS, significant increases in Pig-a MF were observed from Day 15 and Day 8 in the RBC Pig-a and PIGRET assays, respectively. The results of both assays demonstrated that the increases in Pig-a MF were detectable after a single treatment with 1,3-PS. Furthermore, the difference in the kinetics of the increase in Pig-a MF between the RBC Pig-a and PIGRET assays with 1,3-PS suggests that the PIGRET assay has an advantage in detecting the mutant erythrocytes earlier than the RBC Pig-a assay. In contrast, no significant increases were observed in the Pig-a assays using either RBC or reticulocytes with 2-AAF. The negative results in both assays with 2-AAF may indicate the limitation of the single dose method; however, further investigation at higher doses is necessary to determine limitation of the single dose method.",

The International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing (IWGT) showed the usefulness of the RBC Pig-a assay through the evaluation of several compounds. Aristolochic acid (AA), one of the evaluated compounds in the IWGT workgroup, is a carcinogenic plant toxin that is a relatively strong gene mutagen both in vitro and in vivo, but a weak inducer of micronuclei in vivo. In the present study, we examined the mutagenicity of AA in the peripheral blood of rats treated orally with a single dose of AA using Pig-a assays. Furthermore, we evaluated the advantages of the PIGRET assay compared with the RBC Pig-a assay. The results showed that a statistically significant increase in mutant frequency of the Pig-a gene was detected at day 28 by the RBC Pig-a assay, and at days 7, 14 and 28 by the PIGRET assay. In addition, the mutant frequency by the PIGRET assay was higher than that by the RBC Pig-a assay.

To evaluate whether the PIGRET assay is useful and effective as a short-term test, compared with the RBC Pig-a assay, we performed both assays using benzo[a]pyrene (BP), which is a well-known mutagen. BP was used to dose 8-week-old male rats orally at 0, 75.0, 150, and 300\u00a0mg/kg administered as a single administration. Peripheral blood samples were then collected on days 0, 7, 14, and 28 after treatment and were used in both assays. In the treatment groups receiving 150\u00a0mg/kg of BP or more, both the RBC Pig-a assay and the PIGRET assay detected the in vivo mutagenicity of BP. In the 300\u00a0mg/kg treatment group, in which a significant increase in the mutant frequency (MF) was observed at all the sampling points using both the RBC Pig-a assay and the PIGRET assay, the reticulocyte (RET) Pig-a MF was higher than the RBC Pig-a MF on days 7 and 14 after treatment; nevertheless, the negative control RET Pig-a MF was comparable to the negative control RBC Pig-a MF. In addition, the RET Pig-a MF began to increase after day 7 and reached a maximum value on day 14 after treatment, whereas the RBC Pig-a MF increased continuously from day 7 until day 28 after treatment.

In each laboratory rats were exposed to the same dosing regimen of N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (ENU), and red blood cells (RBCs) and reticulocytes (RETs) were collected for mutant phenotypic analysis using flow cytometry. Mutant frequency dose response data were analysed using the PROAST benchmark dose (BMD) statistical package. Laboratory was used as a covariate during the analysis to allow all dose responses to be analysed at the same time, with conserved shape parameters. This approach has recently been shown to increase the precision of the BMD analysis, as well as providing a measure of equipotency. This measure of equipotency was used here to demonstrate a reasonable level of interlaboratory reproducibility. Increased reproducibility could have been achieved by increasing the number of cells scored, as this would reduce the number of zero values within the mutant frequency data. Overall, the interlaboratory trial was successful, and these findings support the transferability of the in vivo Pig-a gene mutation assay.",

Recent advances in sequencing technology can be used to detect mutations by direct sequencing of genomic DNA (gDNA). We previously reported induced de novo mutations detected using whole-exome sequencing in the offspring of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-treated mice in a single-dose experiment (85\u00a0mg/kg, i.p., weekly on two occasions). In this study, two lower doses (10 and 30\u00a0mg/kg) were added, and dose-response of inherited germline mutations was analyzed. Male gpt delta transgenic mice treated with ENU in three dose groups were mated with untreated females 10 weeks after the last treatment, and offspring were obtained. The ENU-treated male mice showed dose-dependent increases in gpt mutant frequencies in their sperm, testis, and liver. gDNA of one family (parents and four offspring) from each dose group was used for whole-exome sequencing, and unique de novo mutations in the offspring were detected. Frequencies of inherited mutations increased with dosage more than 25-fold in the highest dose group. The mutation spectrum of the inherited mutations showed characteristics of ENU-induced mutations, such as A:T base substitutions. No confirmed mutations were observed in the control group. Filtering using the alternate reads ratio resulted in the mutation frequencies and spectra similar to those obtained by the Sanger sequencing confirmation. These results suggest that direct sequencing analysis may be a useful tool to investigate inherited germline mutations induced by environmental mutagens.",

The risk of developing cancer is the most critical complication in organ transplant recipients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. This study aims to explore the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of TAC and MMF alone or combined orally administrated on spleen and bone marrow of Wistar rats. Our results showed that TAC (2.4; 24 and 60\u00a0mg/kg) and MMF (5; 50 and 125\u00a0mg/kg) induced a genotoxic effect on rat bone marrow. Moreover, the co-treatment with the TAC/MMF (2.4/5\u00a0mg/kg b.w.; 2.4/50\u00a0mg/kg b.w. and 60/50\u00a0mg/kg b.w.) produce a genotoxicity as measured by micronuclei (MN) frequencies, chromosomal aberrations (CA) rates and DNA damage levels. Furthermore, the TAC and MMF-treated animals developed oxidative stress in spleen, indicated by a significant increase of malondialdehyde (MDA), protein oxidation and decrease of anti-oxidant enzymes levels such as catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). This damage was associated with an increase of DNA fragmentation. Co-treatment with TAC/MMF synergistically induced markers of oxidative stress in rat splenic tissue. In conclusion, TAC/MMF associated induction in oxidative stress plays a role in the splenic and bone marrow toxicity and enhances the different endpoints of genotoxicity, suggesting its mutagenic action in vivo.",

However, these tests suffer from inadequate specificity: compounds may be wrongly categorized as genotoxic, resulting in unnecessary, time-consuming, and expensive in vivo follow-up testing. In the last decade, novel assays (notably, reporter-based assays) have been developed in an attempt to overcome these drawbacks. Here, we have investigated the performance of two in vitro reporter-based assays, Vitotox and ToxTracker. A set of reference compounds was selected to span a variety of mechanisms of genotoxic action and applicability domains (e.g., pharmaceutical and cosmetic ingredients). Combining the performance of the two assays, we achieved 93% sensitivity and 79% specificity for prediction of gentoxicity for this set of compounds. Both assays permit quick high-throughput analysis of drug candidates, while requiring only small quantities of the test substances.

On these three fractions we assessed mutagenicity using Salmonella reverse mutation test and genotoxicity by alkaline comet assay and micronucleus assay in human lung cancer cell line, A549. Organic extracts were also characterized for alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrated and oxygenated PAHs. We also evaluated associations between the physicochemical parameters of samples and their genotoxicity.The particulate samples, collected in autumn and winter, indicated the presence of both base pair substitution and frameshift mutagens using TA98 and TA100 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and the mutagenicity was more associated with the finest fraction. Enhanced mutagenic response was observed in the absence of enzyme activation. Only a third of comet and a half of micronucleus assays gave positive results that, unlike Salmonella's ones, are not season-related. These results were compared with environmental chemicals concentrations and we found that Salmonella's data correlated with PAHs detected on PM filters and with mass concentrations, whereas the DNA damage correlate only with PAHs extracted from polyurethane foams.The use of different assays was sensitive to detect and identify different classes of airborne mutagenic/genotoxic compounds present in aerosol, showing that monitoring air quality using this methodology is relevant.",

In this study, the radioprotective effect of metformin was investigated against cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by ionizing radiation (IR) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Human lymphocytes were treated with metformin at concentrations 10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM for 2\u00a0h and irradiated with 6\u00a0MV X-rays. The radiation antagonistic potential of metformin was assessed by MTT [3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiaozolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H tetrazolium bromide] assay, chromosomal aberration (CA) analysis, cytokinesis blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay, and flow cytometry. Observations demonstrated a radiation-dose-dependent decrease in the percentage of cell viability after 24\u00a0h. It was found that pretreatment with metformin (10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) increased the percentage of cell viability. A highly significant dose modifying factor (DMF) 1.35 and 1.42 was observed for 10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM metformin, respectively. Metformin (10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) pretreatment significantly decreased the frequency of dicentrics (DCs), acentric fragments (AFs), rings (RIs), micronuclei (MN), and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) in irradiated human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Also, treatment with metformin (10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) without irradiation did not increase the number of MN, NPBs, DCs, AFs, RIs, and did not show a cytostatic effect in the human peripheral blood lymphocytes. On the other hand, metformin treatment (10 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM) 2\u00a0h prior to irradiation significantly reduced X-radiation-induced apoptotic incidence in human lymphocytes. The present study demonstrates metformin to be an effective radioprotector against DNA damage and apoptosis induced by IR in human lymphocytes. These data have an important application for the protection of lymphocytes from the genetic damage and side-effects induced by radiotherapy in cancer patients.",

We have reported earlier that Breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) mutant ovarian cancer cells exhibit increased sensitivity to auranofin. BRCA1 is a DNA repair protein whose functional status is critical in the prognosis of ovarian cancer. Apart from DNA repair capability of cancer cells, membrane fluidity is also implicated in modulating resistance to chemotherapeutics. We report here that membrane fluidity influences the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cell lines, OVCAR5 and IGROV1, to auranofin. Electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis revealed a more fluidized membrane in IGROV1 compared to OVCAR5. Interestingly, IGROV1 cells were more sensitive to auranofin induced cytotoxicity than OVCAR5. In comparison to OVCAR5, IGROV1 cells also exhibited an increased number of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) upon auranofin treatment as assessed by 53BP1 immunostaining. Furthermore, correlation analysis demonstrated a strong positive correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.856) between membrane fluidity and auranofin sensitivity in these cell lines. Auranofin-treated IGROV1 cells also exhibited increased cellular oxidation and apoptosis. Anti-oxidant, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) inhibited the cellular oxidation and apoptosis in auranofin-treated ovarian cancer cells suggesting reactive oxygen species (ROS) mediate the anti-cancer properties of auranofin. Overall, our study suggests that auranofin mediates its cytotoxicity via ROS production in ovarian cancer cells which correlates positively with membrane fluidity.",

After 4\u00a0h exposure, only the metabolically competent cell lines MCL-5 and HepG2 showed MN induction (with a threshold concentration at 25.5\u00a0\u03bcM from MCL-5 cells) indicating the importance of exposure time for genotoxicity. The HPRT assay also displayed linear increases in mutant frequency in MCL-5 cells, after 4\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h treatments. Mutation spectra analysis of MCL-5 and AHH-1 HPRT mutants revealed frequent B[a]P induced G to T transversion mutations (72% and 44% of induced mutations in MCL-5 and AHH-1 respectively). This study therefore demonstrates a key link between metabolic capability, B[a]P exposure time and genotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "The recently introduced Pig-a in vivo gene mutation assay measures endogeneous mutations of Pig-a (human, PIG-A), an X-linked gene that is conserved across species from rodents to humans. Flow cytometric analysis enables the enumeration of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor-deficient erythrocytes, resulting from a mutation in Pig-a/PIG-A, in only a few microliters of peripheral blood. Pig-a/PIG-A mutations appear to function in a neutral manner, allowing evaluation of the accumulated genotoxic effects of repeated exposures. To date, most Pig-a studies have been conducted in rodents; only a few reports regarding human applications of the PIG-A assay have been published. We have conducted a PIG-A assay in the context of human genotoxicity monitoring. Peripheral blood was collected from healthy human donors and chemotherapy-treated cancer patients at Yamagata University Hospital. To investigate the PIG-A mutant frequency (MF) induced by chemotherapy, red blood cells were analyzed via flow cytometry following staining with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-CD235ab (erythrocyte specific) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-CD59 antibodies (GPI-anchored protein specific). Reticulocyte frequencies (%RET) were also analyzed using a phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD71 antibody to monitor bone marrow suppression and reticulocytosis. Two of 27 patients exhibited a significantly elevated frequency of PIG-A mutants. Although we observed either a reduced or an increased %RET in all patients, no association was observed between this factor and the PIG-A MF. Unfortunately, we could not analyze blood samples collected before treatment during therapeutic processes. Additionally, the sampling time point for some patients was too short to express the PIG-A mutant phenotypes. Therefore, the possibility of natively high PIG-A MFs prior to treatment must be considered. The human PIG-A assay shows promise as a human genotoxicity monitoring method.",

     "abstract": "The standard procedure for the micronucleus test in cell lines requires a short exposure (\u22640.5 cell cycle) to the test compounds followed by a long recovery (\u22651.5 cell cycle), and in case of negative or equivocal results, a second test with extended exposure (\u22652 cell cycles) without or with a recovery time. In general the two procedures are advantageous for detecting clastogens and aneugens, respectively. However, whether the recommended procedures apply to micronucleus tests with promutagens in cell lines genetically engineered for expressing biotransformation enzymes has not been identified. In this study, several promutagens dependent on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and/or sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A1 were used in the micronucleus test in a Chinese hamster V79-derived cell line expressing human CYP2E1 and SULT1A1 (V79-hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1), with varying exposure/recovery schedules: 3\u00a0h/21\u00a0h, 6\u00a0h/18\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h/12\u00a0h, 18\u00a0h/6\u00a0h, and 24\u00a0h/0\u00a0h, in comparison with known clastogens and aneugens in V79 control cells. The results showed peaked micronuclei induction by mitomycin C and bleomycin (clastogens) at the 12\u00a0h/12\u00a0h schedule, while colchicine and vinblastine (aneugens) showed the strongest effect at 24\u00a0h/0\u00a0h. Catechol and trihydroxybenzene (activated by CYP2E1) induced micronuclei most strongly at 6\u00a0h/18\u00a0h, whereas somewhat longer exposures were optimal for hydroquinone, another compound activated by CYP2E1. 1-Hydroxymethylpyrene (activated by SULT1A1) and 1-methylpyrene (activated sequentially by CYP2E1 and SULT1A1) produced the highest response with the 18\u00a0h/6\u00a0h treatment regimen. Moreover, mitotic arrest by 1-hydroxymethylpyrene was observed in V79-hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1 cells but not in V79 cells, and 1-methylpyrene arrested mitosis in V79-hCYP2E1-hSULT1A1 more strongly than in V79 cells. Our study suggests that intracellular bioactivation of promutagens may not delay the induction of micronuclei in the present model, and 1-methylpyrene and 1-hydroxymethylpyrene may be activated to mitosis-arresting metabolites.",

     "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggest that occupational exposure to open-cast coal mining residues like dust particles, heavy metals and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) may cause a wide range of DNA damage and genomic instability that could be associated to initial steps in cancer development and other work-related diseases. The aim of our study was to evaluate if key polymorphisms in metabolism genes CYP1A1Msp1, GSTM1Null, GSTT1Null and DNA repair genes XRCC1Arg194Trp and hOGG1Ser326Cys could modify individual susceptibility to adverse coal exposure effects, considering the DNA damage (Comet assay) and micronucleus formation in lymphocytes (CBMN) and buccal mucosa cells (BMNCyt) as endpoints for genotoxicity. The study population is comprised of 200 healthy male subjects, 100 open-cast coal-mining workers from \u201cEl Cerrej\u00f3n\u201d (world\u2019s largest open-cast coal mine located in Guajira \u2013 Colombia) and 100 non-exposed referents from general population. The data revealed a significant increase of CBMN frequency in peripheral lymphocytes of occupationally exposed workers carrying the wild-type variant of GSTT1 (+) gene. Exposed subjects carrying GSTT1null polymorphism showed a lower micronucleus frequency compared with their positive counterparts (FR: 0.83; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04), while BMNCyt, frequency and Comet assay parameters in lymphocytes: Damage Index (DI) and percentage of DNA in the tail (Tail % DNA) were significantly higher in exposed workers with the GSTM1Null polymorphism. Other exfoliated buccal mucosa abnormalities related to cell death (Karyorrhexis and Karyolysis) were increased in GSTT/M1Null carriers. Nuclear buds were significantly higher in workers carrying the CYP1A1Msp1 (m1/m2, m2/m2) allele. Moreover, BMNCyt frequency and Comet assay parameters were significantly lower in exposed carriers of XRCC1Arg194Trp (Arg/Trp, Trp/Trp) and hOGG1Ser326Cys (Ser/Cys, Cys/Cys), thereby providing new data to the increasing evidence about the protective role of these polymorphisms. This modulation may involve specific and differentiated pathways in different tissues that also may cause a differential sensitivity related to differential induction of some enzymes.",

Eggs and larvae exposed to different concentrations of 1KL39-B (25, 30, 50, 70, and 80\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) and of 1KL43-C (12.5, 20, 25, 30 and 40\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) exhibited toxicity and susceptibility, with 100% mortality.

The gradual decrease in oviposition of the females of the G1 to G4 generations was proportional to the increase in concentrations of these compounds, which could be related to the cumulative effect of cell anomalies in neuroblasts and oocytes (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), including micronuclei, budding, multinucleated cells and nuclear bridges. These findings showed that both 1KL39-B and 1KL43-C can serve as potential alternatives in the control of A. albopictus.",

The mitotic index and cell proliferation kinetics in human lymphocyte cultures in the presence of these ethyl-carbamates were used to evaluate cytotoxicity and cytostaticity respectively. Exposure to greater acute doses (300\u00a0mg/kg) and to all of the subchronic doses (12.5, 25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg daily for 90 days) of these ethyl-carbamates induced an increased frequency (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of micro-nucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCE) compared with rats not exposed to the ethyl-carbamates. Increases in MN-PCE was higher in males than in females exposed to LQM 996 50\u00a0mg/Kg (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). All observed changes in rats return 21\u00a0days after suspending ethyl-carbamate exposure. The highest concentration (0.3\u00a0mM) of both ethyl-carbamates in lymphocyte cultures increased the percentage of cells in first division metaphase and decreased the percentage of cells in third division metaphase, indicating an increase in cell cycle length or a possible cell cycle arrest in metaphase (cytostatic effect).

     "abstract": "UV-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated in photocarcinogenesis and skin aging. This is because UV-induced ROS can induce DNA damage that, if unrepaired, can lead to carcinogenesis. Sunscreens contain UV attenuators, such as organic chemical and/or physical UV filters, which can prevent all forms of damage from UV irradiation. In recent years, the effective broad-spectrum UV attenuation properties of ZnO-nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) have made them attractive as active components in sunscreens and other personal care products. As the use of ZnO-NPs in sunscreens is on the rise, so is public concern about their safety, particularly with exposure to sunlight. Therefore, in the present study, using various experimental approaches, we investigated the possible toxic effects resulting from exposure to UVB and ZnO-NPs in primary mouse keratinocytes (PMKs) as well as in the skin of SKH-1 hairless mice. The findings of the present study demonstrated that co-exposure to UVB and ZnO-NPs: (1) translocated the ZnO-NPs into the nucleus of PMKs; (2) caused enhanced generation of ROS; (3) induced more severe DNA damage as evident by alkaline comet assay and immunocytochemistry for \u03b3-H2AX and 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG); and (4) subsequently caused much more pronounced cell death in PMKs. Further, to elucidate the physiological relevance of these in vitro findings, SKH-1 hairless mice were topically treated with ZnO-NPs and after 30\u00a0min irradiated with UVB (50\u00a0mJ/cm2). Interestingly, we found that co-exposure of ZnO-NPs and UVB caused increased oxidative DNA damage and cell death, indicated by immunostaining for 8-OHdG and TUNEL assay in sections of exposed mouse skin. Thus, collectively, our findings suggest that UVB exposure increases ZnO-NPs-mediated oxidative stress and oxidative damage, thereby enhancing ZnO-NPs-induced cell death.",

Intraperitoneal administration of DHS at 2\u00a0mg/kg for five consecutive days before irradiation and three times per week during the post-irradiation period showed maximum benefit (40% improvement in 30 d post-irradiation survival). DHS treatment, despite inducing expression of glutathione peroxidases (GPx1, GPx2, and GPx4) in spleen and intestine, did not protect against radiation-induced acute (10-day) haematopoietic and gastrointestinal toxicities. DHS treatment significantly reduced radiation-induced DNA damage in peripheral leukocytes and inflammatory responses in intestine, lung, and circulation. The anti-inflammatory effect of DHS was associated with reductions in lipid peroxidation, expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as Icam-1, Ccl-2, and iNos-2, and subsequent infiltration of inflammatory cells. Irradiated mice treated with DHS survived until day 30 post-irradiation and showed restoration of spleen cellularity and intestinal villi, but had moderately increased systemic and tissue-specific inflammatory responses. Another organoselenium compound, selenomethionine, evaluated in parallel with DHS at the same dose and treatment schedule, showed comparable radioprotective effects. The mechanism of radioprotection by DHS is mainly via suppression of inflammatory responses.",

The dose response of multiple biological endpoints, including G2/A-PCC (G2/M and M/A-PCC) index, PCC ring (PCC-R), ratio of the longest/shortest length (L/L ratio), and length and width ratio of the longest chromosome (L/B ratio), were investigated in calyculin A-induced G2/A-PCC spreads in human peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed to 0\u201320\u00a0Gy (dose\u2013rate of 1\u00a0Gy/min) cobalt-60 gamma-rays.

Three types of PCC-R were scored according to their shape and their solidity or hollowness. The frequencies of hollow PCC-R and PCC-R including or excluding solid ring in G2/A-PCC spreads were enhanced with increased doses. The length and width of the longest chromosome, as well as the length of the shortest chromosome in each G2/M-PCC or M/A-PCC spread, were measured. All L/L or L/B ratios in G2/M-PCC or M/A-PCC spread increased with enhanced doses. A blind test with two new irradiated doses was conducted to validate which biomarker could be used in dose estimation.

     "abstract": "Several studies have reported that guanylhydrazones display a variety of desirable biological properties, such as antihypertensive, antibacterial, and antimalarial behaviour. They furthermore promote anti-pneumocystosis and anti-trypanosomiasis, exhibit antitumor activity, and show significant cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines. In this work, we have evaluated the cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and genotoxicity of two guanylhydrazones derivatives, (E)-2-[(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl) methylene] hydrazine carboxymidamide hydrochloride (2,3-DMeB) and (E)-2-[(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) methylene] hydrazine carboxymidamide hydrochloride (3,4-DMeB), in different biological models. Both 2,3-DMeB and 3,4-DMeB induce weak cytotoxic and mutagenic effects in bacteria and yeast. The genotoxicity of these compounds was determined in a fibroblast cell line (V79) using alkaline comet assay, as well as a modified comet assay with bacterial enzymes formamidopyrimidine DNA-glycosylase (FPG) and endonuclease III (EndoIII). Both guanylhydrazone derivatives induced DNA damage. Treatment of V79 cells with EndoIII and FPG proteins demonstrated a significant effect of 2,3-DMeB and 3,4-DMeB with respect to oxidized bases. In addition, the derivatives induced a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated cells at high doses. The antifungal and anti-trypanosomal properties of these guanylhydrazone derivatives were also evaluated, and the obtained results suggest that 2,3-DMeB is more effective than 3,4-DMeB. The biological activity of 2,3-DMeB and 3,4-DMeB may thus be related, at least in part, to their oxidative potential, as well as to their ability to interact with DNA. Considering the previously reported in vitro antitumor activity of guanylhydrazone derivatives in combination with the lack of acute toxicity and the fact that DNA damage is only observed at high doses should render both compounds good candidates for in vivo studies on antitumor activity.",

The synthesis of the AgNPs was monitored by UV\u2013vis spectrophotometry. The AgNPs were characterised by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and small-angle X-ray scattering. Functional groups on the AgNPs were established by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.

Non-synonymous variants T83M [CYP1A2*9], S212C [CYP1A2*12], S298R [part of CYP1A2*21], G299S [CYP1A2*13], I314V [no allele designation], I386F [CYP1A2*4], C406Y [CYP1A2*5] and R456H [CYP1A2*8] were examined. The cDNAs for each of these variants and the wild-type were co-expressed with human NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in the TA1535-based system. The bioactivation capacity of these CYP1A2 variants was investigated using three CYP1A2-dependent pro-mutagens, 1-aminopyrene (1AP), 2-aminoanthracene (2AA), and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo(4,5-f)quinoline (IQ). All CYP1A2 variants except R456H, T83M, and I386F gave positive responses with all three compounds. Variant R456H generated no detectable holoenzyme and no detectable response for any of the compounds; I386F did not bioactivate IQ; T83M did not bioactivate 1AP.

Here, we examined the effects of particle size and dispersion status on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of nanosized and fine ZnO, in the presence and absence of bovine serum albumin (BSA; 0.06%) in human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells. Dynamic light scattering analysis showed the most homogenous dispersions in water alone for nanosized ZnO and in water with BSA for fine ZnO. After a 48-h treatment, both types of ZnO were cytotoxic within a similar, narrow dose range (1.5\u20133.0\u00a0\u03bcg/cm2) and induced micronuclei at a near toxic dose range (1.25\u20131.75\u00a0\u03bcg/cm2), both with and without BSA. In the comet assay, nanosized ZnO (1.25\u20131.5\u00a0\u03bcg/cm2), in the absence of BSA, caused a statistically significant increase in DNA damage after 3-h and 6-h treatments, while fine ZnO did not. Our findings may be explained by better uptake or faster intracellular dissolution of nanosized ZnO without BSA during short treatments (3\u20136\u00a0h; the comet assay), with less differences between the two ZnO forms after longer treatments (>48\u00a0h; the in vitro micronucleus test). As ZnO is genotoxic within a narrow dose range partly overlapping with cytotoxic doses, small experimental differences e.g. in the dispersion of ZnO particles may have a substantial effect on the genotoxicity of the nominal doses added to the cell culture.",

     "abstract": "Glycidol (Gly) is an electrophilic low-molecular weight epoxide that is classified by IARC as probably carcinogenic to humans. Humans might be exposed to Gly from food, e.g. refined vegetable oils, where Gly has been found as a food process contaminant. It is therefore important to investigate and quantify the genotoxicity of Gly as a primary step towards cancer risk assessment of the human exposure.Here, quantification of the mutagenic potency expressed per dose (AUC: area under the concentration-time curve) of Gly has been performed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, using the HPRT assay. The dose of Gly was estimated in the cell exposure medium by trapping Gly with a strong nucleophile, cob(I)alamin, to form stable cobalamin adducts for analysis by LC\u2013MS/MS. Gly was stable in the exposure medium during the time for cell treatment, and thus the dose in vitro is the initial concentration\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0cell treatment time. Gly induced mutations in the hprt-gene at a rate of 0.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 mutations/105 cells/mMh. Through comparison with the effect of ionizing radiation in the same system a relative mutagenic potency of 9.5\u00a0rad-eq./mMh was obtained, which could be used for comparison of genotoxicity of chemicals and between test systems and also in procedures for quantitative cancer risk assessment.Gly was shown to induce strand breaks, that were repaired by base excision repair. Furthermore, Gly-induced lesions, present during replication, were found to delay the replication fork elongation. From experiments with repair deficient cells, homologous recombination repair and the ERCC1-XPF complex were indicated to be recruited to support in the repair of the damage related to the stalled replication elongation. The type of DNA damage responsible for the mutagenic effect of Gly could not be concluded from the present study.",

     "abstract": "Sister Chromatid Exchanges (SCEs) are known to enhance as a consequence of exposure to various mutagenic agents and appear to indicate DNA damaging effects and/or subsequent repair by homologous recombination (HR). DNA damage plays an interesting role in the majority of mechanisms underlying the effects of antitumor drugs, since the genetic activity of the plethora of these agents is due to their ability to damage the DNA. The DNA-effects of antitumor agents towards normal cells (genotoxicity) are great drawbacks of antitumor therapy and are connected to important adverse health effects in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. On the other hand, failure of chemotherapy in many cases is due to the DNA repair ability which cancer, like normal cells, also possess. As both DNA repair and genotoxic exposure are expected to vary among patients, correlating SCEs frequencies with only individual repair capacity may be feasible to predict. Cancer risk has not been observed to be associated with high SCEs levels. Since the administration of effective antitumor drugs with limited adverse effects is of great importance in the success of anticancer therapy, a lot of interest has been directed toward the development of methods and approaches that would enable the correct selection of appropriate drugs prior to the initiation of therapy on an individual basis. To this effect, more than 30 years ago, an investigation of the ability of the in vitro and the in vivo SCEs-assay to predict the in vitro and in vivo sensitivity of tumor cells to newly synthesized drugs or to those already in use began. In this short review a critical appraisal of the SCEs-assay as an important biomarker used for predicting cancer chemo-response as well as a summary of the key findings from several studies published within the last 20 years in this field is performed.",

The amount of smoke particles to which cells were exposed were also determined, and dose-response curves describing the relationships between exposure to smoke particles and the number of revertants induced were plotted. The slopes of linear regressions of the dose-response curves were determined, and the slope for each CS was used as a mutagenic activity index for that CS. A new heated cigarette was also tested and smoke from the heated cigarette had a lower mutagenic activity in TA98 and TA100 with metabolic activation than did the conventional CS.

Since APC can enhance genotoxic effects of mutagens measured by the comet assay, this approach has been proposed for increasing the sensitivity of the comet assay in human biomonitoring. The APC-modified comet assay has mainly been performed with human blood and it was shown that it not only enhances the detection of DNA damage repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER) but also damage typically repaired by base excision repair (BER). Recently, we reported that in contrast to blood leukocytes, A549 cells (a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line) seem to be insensitive towards the repair-inhibiting action of APC. To further elucidate the general usefulness of the APC-modified comet assay for studying repair in cultured mammalian cells, we comparatively investigated further cell lines (HeLa, TK6, V79). DNA damage was induced by BPDE (benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide) and MMS (methyl methanesulfonate) in the absence and presence of APC (3 or 15\u00a0\u03bcM). APC was either added for 2\u00a0h together with the mutagen or cells were pre-incubated for 30\u00a0min with APC before the mutagen was added. The results indicate that the cell lines tested differ fundamentally with regard to their sensitivity and specificity towards the repair-inhibiting effect of APC. The actual cause for these differences is still unclear but potential molecular explanations are discussed. Irrespective of the underlying mechanism(s), our study revealed practical limitations of the use of the APC-modified comet assay.",

The efficacy of the apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) in the cleavage of abasic site lesions in the presence of carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT-COOH) and graphene oxide (GO) are compared. The CNMs were found to perturb the incision activity of APE1. The reason for such perturbation process was anticipated to take place either by the non-specific adsorption of APE1 over the free surface of the CNMs or steric hindrance offered by the CNM-DNA complex. Accordingly, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was selectively utilized to block the free surface of the CNM-DNA hybrid material. Further treatment of the CNM-DNA-BSA complex with APE1 resulted in a marginal increase in APE1 efficiency. This indicates that APE1 in solution is unable to process the abasic sites on DNA adsorbed over the CNMs. However, the cleavage activity of APE1 was restored in the presence of non-ionic surfactant (Tween 20) that inhibits adsorption of the DNA on the surface of the CNMs. The conformational deformation of the DNA, along with steric hindrance induced by the CNMs resulted in the inhibition of abasic site DNA repair by APE1. Moreover, appreciable changes in the secondary structure of APE1 adsorbed over the CNMs were observed that contribute further to the repair refractivity of the abasic sites. From a toxicological viewpoint, these findings can be extended to the study of the effect of engineered nanoparticles in the intracellular DNA repair process.",

We found that only 20% of benzo(a)pyrene-induced MT clones immortalised suggesting that, alone, the MT phenotype is insufficient for senescence bypass. From a total of 12 B(a)P- immortalised MT lines, inactivating p53 mutations were identified in 30% of clones, and the majority of these were consistent with the potent carcinogen\u2019s mode of action. Expression of p16 was commonly silenced or markedly reduced with extensive promoter methylation observed in 45% of MT clones, while Bmi1 was strongly upregulated in 25% of clones. In instances where secondary events to MT appeared necessary for senescence bypass, as evidenced by a transient cellular crisis, clonal growth correlated with monoallelic deletion of the CDKN2A/B locus. The findings further implicate the importance of p16 and p53 pathways in regulating senescence while providing a molecular evaluation of SHE CTA \u2212derived variant MT clones induced by benzo(a)pyrene.",

     "abstract": "Accumulated DNA damage in hematopoietic stem cells is a primary mechanism of aging-associated dysfunction in human hematopoiesis. About 70 years ago, atomic-bomb (A-bomb) radiation induced DNA damage and functional decreases in the hematopoietic system of A-bomb survivors in a radiation dose-dependent manner. The peripheral blood cell populations then recovered to a normal range, but accompanying cells derived from hematopoietic stem cells still remain that bear molecular changes possibly caused by past radiation exposure and aging. In the present study, we evaluated radiation-related changes in the frequency of phosphorylated (Ser-139) H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) foci formation in circulating CD34-positive/lineage marker-negative (CD34\u00a0+\u00a0Lin-) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) among 226Hiroshima A-bomb survivors. An association between the frequency of \u03b3H2AX foci formation in HSPCs and the radiation dose was observed, but the \u03b3H2AX foci frequency was not significantly elevated by past radiation. We found a negative correlation between the frequency of \u03b3H2AX foci formation and the length of granulocyte telomeres. A negative interaction effect between the radiation dose and the frequency of \u03b3H2AX foci was suggested in a proportion of a subset of HSPCs as assessed by the cobblestone area-forming cell assay (CAFC), indicating that the self-renewability of HSPCs may decrease in survivors who were exposed to a higher radiation dose and who had more DNA damage in their HSPCs. Thus, although many years after radiation exposure and with advancing age, the effect of DNA damage on the self-renewability of HSPCs may be modified by A-bomb radiation exposure.",

The Carcinogenicity and Genotoxicity eXperience (CGX) dataset created by Kirkland et al. was used for the carcinogenicity and in vitro genotoxicity data, i.e., Ames and chromosome aberration (CA) tests. Broad literature surveys were conducted to gather in vivo MN or TGR test data to add to the CGX dataset. Genotoxicity data in vitro were also updated slightly. Data on 379 chemicals (293 carcinogens and 86 non-carcinogens) were available for the in vivo MN test; sensitivity, specificity or concordances were calculated as 41.0%, 60.5% or 45.4%, respectively. For the TGR test, data on 80 chemicals (76 carcinogens and 4 non-carcinogens) were available; sensitivity was calculated as 72.4%. Based on the recent guidance on genotoxicity testing strategies, performance (sensitivity/specificity) of the following combinations was calculated; Ames\u00a0+\u00a0in vivo MN (68.7%/45.3%), Ames\u00a0+\u00a0TGR (83.8%/not calculated (nc)), Ames\u00a0+\u00a0in vitro CA\u00a0+\u00a0in vivo MN (80.8%/21.3%), Ames\u00a0+\u00a0in vitro CA\u00a0+\u00a0TGR (89.1%/nc), Ames\u00a0+\u00a0in vivo MN\u00a0+\u00a0TGR (87.5%/nc), Ames\u00a0+\u00a0in vitro CA\u00a0+\u00a0in vivo MN\u00a0+\u00a0TGR (89.3%/nc).

     "abstract": "New OECD test guidelines have been issued, in which the cytotoxicity index relative cell count (RCC) is replaced with a new index, RICC or RPD (relative increase in cell count/relative population doubling), with the goal of reducing the high proportion of false positive results in in vitro chromosomal aberration tests. Using a mathematical approach to estimate new indices from the RCC, we constructed an evaluation flow that quantitatively estimates how often the previous test conclusions change when applying the updated cytotoxicity criteria. The new evaluation flow was applied to a retrospective evaluation of 285 chemicals in two databases. The effects of the employment of new cytotoxicity indices are investigated at a large scale. Using the new evaluation flow, 90 chemicals were estimated as positive, 39 were designated as estimated negative (13 probably negative and 26 possibly negative), and 140 were designated as negative. Moreover, we also applied a prioritization index to indicate the likelihood of a chemical being re-evaluated as negative and assigned priorities for testing. Most of the chemicals that were designated as estimated negative and had negative results in the in vivo micronucleus tests were considered as false-positives that would be correctly judged under the new test guideline. Furthermore, statistical analysis of the frequency of estimated negatives revealed that the results for Ames-positive chemicals, especially those with a strong response, are unlikely to change. Therefore, we concluded that the new indices would likely reduce the proportion of false positive results and not increase the proportion of false negative results. This study is the first report of a comprehensive re-evaluation of test results in terms of new cytotoxicity indices. The evaluation flow we have developed facilitates efficient retrospective evaluation of genotoxicity.",

Although pathological effects of SM on mustard lung have been widely considered, molecular and cellular mechanisms for these pathologies are poorly understood. We investigated changes in expression of genes related to oxidative stress (OS) and antioxidant defense caused by SM in lung tissue of patients. We performed gene expression profiling of OS and antioxidant defense in lung tissue samples from healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and SM-exposed patients (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Changes in gene expression were measured using a 96-well RT2 Profiler \u2122PCR Array: Human Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense, which arrayed 84 genes functionally involved in cellular OS response. 47 (55.95%) genes were found to be significantly upregulated in patients with mustard lung compared with controls (p<\u00a00.05), whereas 7 (8.33%) genes were significantly downregulated (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Among the most upregulated genes were OS responsive-1 (OXSR1), forkhead box M1 (FOXM1), and glutathione peroxidase-2 (GPX2), while metallothionein-3 (MT3) and glutathione reductase (GSR) were the most downregulated genes. Expression of hypoxia-induced genes (CYGB and MB), antioxidants and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing genes were significantly altered, suggesting an increased oxidative damage in mustard lungs. Mustard lungs were characterized by hypoxia, massive production of ROS, OS, disruption of epithelial cells, surfactant dysfunction, as well as increased risk of lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis. Oxidative stress induced by ROS is the major mechanism for direct effect of SM exposure on respiratory system. Antioxidant treatment may improve the main features of mustard lungs.",

Such a correlation could have important implications for risk assessment, including informing the mode of action (MOA) of specific carcinogens. When in vivo genotoxic potency is weak relative to carcinogenic potency, MOAs other than genotoxicity (e.g., endocrine disruption or regenerative hyperplasia) may be operational. Herein, we review recent in vivo genotoxicity and carcinogenicity data for hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)), following oral ingestion, in relevant tissues and species in the context of the aforementioned correlation. Potency estimates were generated using benchmark doses, or no-observable-adverse-effect-levels when data were not amenable to dose-response modeling. While the ratio between log values for carcinogenic and genotoxic potency was \u22651 for many compounds, the ratios for several Cr(VI) datasets (including in target tissue) were less than unity. In fact, the ratios for Cr(VI) clustered closely with ratios for chloroform and diethanolamine, two chemicals posited to have non-genotoxic MOAs. These findings suggest that genotoxicity may not play a major role in the cancers observed in rodents following exposure to high concentrations of Cr(VI) in drinking water\u2014a finding consistent with recent MOA and adverse outcome pathway (AOP) analyses concerning Cr(VI). This semi-quantitative analysis, therefore, may be useful to augment traditional MOA and AOP analyses.

The method is also applicable to liver MN assays involving partial hepatectomy or the use of juvenile rats. Here, we propose an improved method for staining HEPs prepared from formalin-fixed liver tissues for MN assays, without collagenase treatment. HEP suspensions are prepared by treating the tissues with concentrated KOH and a fluorescent dye, SYBR\u00ae Gold (SYGO), is used for staining. Visualization of the MN in SYGO-stained HEPs is clearer than with Wright-Giemsa staining. We compared the induction of MN as measured with our new method versus the conventional method using collagenase dispersion. Our method not only enables the integration of the liver MN assay into a general RD toxicity study but also allows it to be conducted retrospectively.",

     "abstract": "The widespread applications of graphene family nanomaterials (GFNs) raised the considerable concern over human health and environment. The cyto-genotoxic potentiality of GFNs has attracted much more attention, albeit the potential effects on the cellular epigenome remain largely unknown. The effects of GFNs on cellular genome were evaluated with single and double stranded DNA damage and DNA repair gene expressions while the effects on epigenome was accomplished by addressing the global DNA methylation and expression of DNA methylation machineries at non-cytotoxic to moderately cytotoxic doses in in vitro system. We used five different representatives of GFNs-pristine (GNP-Prist), carboxylated (GNP-COOH) and aminated (GNP-NH2) graphene nanoplatelets as well as single layer (SLGO) and few layer (FLGO) graphene oxide. The order of single stranded DNA damage was observed as GNP-Prist\u00a0\u2265\u00a0GNP-COOH\u00a0>\u00a0GNP-NH2\u00a0\u2265\u00a0FLGO\u00a0>\u00a0SLGO at 10\u00a0mg/L and marked dose dependency was found in SLGO. The GFNs possibly caused genotoxicity by affecting nucleotide excision repair and non-homologus end joining repair systems. Besides, dose dependent increase in global DNA methylation (hypermethylation) were observed in SLGO/FLGO exposure and conversely, GNPs treatment caused hypomethylation following the order as GNP-COOH\u00a0>\u00a0GNP-NH2\u00a0\u2265\u00a0GNP-Prist. The decrements of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3B gene) and methyl-CpG binding domain protein (MBD1) genes were probably the cause of global hypomethylation induced by GNPs. Conversely, the de novo methylation through the up-regulation of DNMT3B and MBD1 genes gave rise to the global DNA hypermethylation in SLGO/FLGO treated cells. In general, the GFNs induced genotoxicity and alterations of global DNA methylation exhibited compounds type specificity with differential physico-chemical properties. Taken together, our study suggests that the GFNs could cause more subtle changes in gene expression programming by modulating DNA methylation status and this information would be helpful for their prospective use in biomedical field.",

Increasing incidences of multiple drug-resistance (MDR) strains are emerging as one of the major public health threats. However, the drugs in use are still incapable of controlling the appalling upsurge of MDR. In recent years a marked number of research groups have devoted their attention toward the development of specific and cost-effective antimicrobial agents against targeted MDR-Tuberculosis. In previous studies, ruthenium(II) complexes (SCAR) have shown a promising activity against MDR-Tuberculosis although few studies have indeed considered ruthenium toxicity. Therefore, within the preclinical requirements, we have sought to determine the cyto-genotoxicity of three SCAR complexes in this present study. The treatment with the SCARs induced a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability in CHO-K1 and HepG2 cells. Based on the clonogenic survival, SCAR 5 was found to be more cytotoxic while SCAR 6 exhibited selectivity action on tumor cells. Although SCAR 4 and 5 did not indicate any mutagenic activity as evidenced by the Ames and Cytokinesis block micronucleus cytome assays, the complex SCAR 6 was found to engender a frameshift mutation detected by Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of S9. Similarly, we observed a chromosomal damage in HepG2 cells with significant increases of micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridges. These data indicate that SCAR 4 and 5 complexes did not show genotoxicity in our models while SCAR 6 was considered mutagenic. This study presented a comprehensive genotoxic evaluation of SCAR complexes were shown to be genotoxic in vitro. All in all, further studies are required to fully elucidate how the properties can affect human health.",

Vitamin D3 deficiency affects 25\u201350% of the human population and has been associated with increased risk for development of hypertension. DNA damage induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurs more often in hypertensive than in normotensive individuals, and vitamin D3 status can influence this relationship. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether a diet supplemented with (10,000\u00a0IU/kg) or deficient in (0\u00a0IU/kg) vitamin D3, compared to a vitamin D3 control diet (1000\u00a0IU/kg), would modulate DNA damage and ROS production in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive control Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats after 12 weeks of treatment. ROS production was assessed by measuring the oxidative burst of neutrophils. DNA damage was evaluated using the comet assay in peripheral blood and the micronucleus test in bone marrow and peripheral blood. Vitamin D3 supplementation did not induce DNA damage and did not change neutrophil ROS production in SHR and WKY rats. Vitamin D3 deficiency induced neutrophil ROS production and a high frequency of micronucleus formation in the bone marrow and peripheral blood of SHR rats only, and induced DNA damage (comet) in peripheral blood of both SHR and WKY rats. In conclusion, vitamin D3 deficiency showed a more pronounced effect on hypertensive animals. Population studies are needed to test whether this relationship also exists in humans.",

     "abstract": "The Alternaria mycotoxins alternariol (AOH) and altertoxin II (ATX II) have previously been shown to elicit mutagenic and genotoxic effects in bacterial and mammalian cells, although with vastly different activities. For example, ATX II was about 50 times more mutagenic than AOH. We now report that stemphyltoxin III (STTX III) is also highly mutagenic. The more pronounced effects of the perylene quinones ATX II and STTX III at lower concentrations compared to the dibenzo-\u03b1-pyrone AOH indicate a marked dependence of the genotoxic potential on the chemical structure and furthermore suggest that the underlying modes of action may be different. We have now further investigated the type of DNA damage induced by AOH, ATX II and STTX III, as well as the repair kinetics and their dependence on the status of nucleotide excision repair (NER).DNA double strand breaks induced by AOH due to poisoning of topoisomerase II\u03b1 were completely repaired in less than 2\u00a0h. Under cell-free conditions, inhibition of topoisomerase II\u03b1 could also be measured for ATX II and STTX III at low concentrations, but the perylene quinones were catalytic inhibitors rather than topoisomerase poisons and did not induce DSBs. DNA strand breaks induced by ATX II and STTX III were more persistent and not completely repaired within 24\u00a0h. A dependence of the repair rate on the NER status could only be demonstrated for STTX III, resulting in an accumulation of DNA damage in NER-deficient cells. Together with the finding that the DNA glycosylase formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg), but not T4 endonuclease V, is able to generate additional DNA strand breaks measurable by the alkaline unwinding assay, we conclude that the genotoxicity of the perylene quinones with an epoxide group is probably caused by the formation of DNA adducts which may be converted to Fpg sensitive sites.",

     "abstract": "Heavy metal exposure or dietary deficiency is associated with increased genetic damage, cancer and age-related diseases. Folate (vitamin B9) required for DNA repair and synthesis may increase cellular susceptibility to metal induced genotoxicity. This study investigated the interactive effects of folic acid deficiency and sufficiency on genome instability and cytotoxicity induced by chromium (VI), copper (II), manganese (II), lead (IV), and their mixture (CCMP) in WIL2-NS human B lymphoblastoid cells. WIL2-NS cells were cultured in folic acid deficient (20\u00a0nM) and replete (2000\u00a0nM) RPMI 1640 medium treated with different concentrations (0.00\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcM) of the metals and CCMP for 48\u00a0h. Chromosomal damage and cytotoxicity were measured using the Cytokinesis-block Micronucleus Cytome assay. CCMP, Cr, Pb, Cu and Mn induced concentration dependent, increases in cells with chromosome damage (micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges, nuclear buds) and necrotic cells and decreased nuclear division index. The metals exhibited different cytotoxic and genotoxic potentials (CCMP\u00a0>\u00a0Cr\u00a0>\u00a0Pb\u00a0>\u00a0Cu\u00a0>\u00a0Mn) in both folate deficient and sufficient cells, with the cytogenotoxic effects being greater in folate deficient cells. Significant interaction between the metals and folic acid suggests that folic acid deficiency exacerbated cell proliferation inhibition and genome instability induced by metals. Folate deficiency, increasing metal concentration, and their interactions explained 3\u201311%, 74\u201392% and 4\u201312% of the variance of DNA damage biomarkers. In conclusion, exposure to the tested metals (0.01\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcM) increased chromosomal DNA damage in WIL2-NS cells and this was exacerbated by folate deficiency.",

Although no evidence on undesired side effects of a plasma treatment has yet been presented, skepticism toward the safety of the exposure to plasma is present. However, only little data regarding the mutagenic potential of this new treatment option is available. Accordingly, we investigated the mutagenic potential of an argon plasma jet (kinpen) using different testing systems in accordance with ISO norms and multiple cell lines: a HPRT1 mutation assay, a micronucleus formation assay, and a colony formation assay. Moderate plasma treatment up to 180\u00a0s did not increase genotoxicity in any assay or cell type investigated. We conclude that treatment with the argon plasma jet kinpen did not display a mutagenic potential under the test conditions applied and may from this perspective be regarded as safe for the use in biomedical applications.",

Excessive production of free radicals may cause oxidative damage to DNA and other molecules, leading to complications of the disease. It may be possible to delay or reduce such damage by administration of antioxidants such as folic acid (FA). The objective of this study was to determine the effect of FA on nuclear abnormalities (NAs) in the oral mucosa of patients with DM. NAs (micronucleated cells, binucleated cells, pyknotic nuclei, karyorrhexis, karyolysis, abnormally condensed chromatin, and nuclear buds) were analyzed in 2000 cells from 45 healthy individuals (control group) and 55 patients with controlled or uncontrolled type I or II DM; 35 patients in the latter group were treated with FA. Samples were taken from the FA group before and after treatment. An increased rate of NAs was found in patients with DM in comparison with that of the control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). FA supplementation in patients with DM reduced the frequency of NAs (20.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.0 before treatment vs. 10.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 after treatment; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

     "abstract": "Humans are continually exposed to ionizing radiation from natural as well as anthropogenic sources. Though biological effects of high dose radiation exposures have been well accepted, studies on low-to-moderate dose exposures (in the range of 50\u2013500\u00a0mGy) have been strongly debated even as researchers continue to search for elusive \u2018radiation signatures\u2019 in humans. Proteins are considered as dynamic functional players that drive cellular responses. However, there is little proteomic information available in context of human exposure to ionizing radiation. In this study, we determined differential expressed proteins in G0 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy individuals 1\u00a0h and 4\u00a0h after \u2018ex vivo\u2019 exposure with two radiation doses (300\u00a0mGy and 1\u00a0Gy). Twenty-three proteins were found to be significantly altered in irradiated cells when compared to sham irradiated cells with fold change \u00b11.5-fold (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05), with only three proteins showing \u22652.5-fold change, either with dose or with time. Mass spectrometry analyses identified redox sensor protein, chloride intracellular channel protein 1 (CLIC-1), the antioxidant protein, peroxiredoxin-6 and the pro-survival molecular chaperone 78\u00a0KDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78) among the 23 modulated proteins. The mean coefficient of variation (CV) for the twenty-three radiation responsive protein spots was found to be 33.7% for 300\u00a0mGy and 48.3% for 1\u00a0Gy. We thus, conclude that the radiation proteomic response of G0 human PBMCs, which are in the resting stage of the cell cycle, involves moderate upregulation of protective mechanisms, with low inter-individual variability. This study will help further our understanding of cellular effects of low dose acute radiation in humans and contribute toward differential biomarker discovery.",

Autophagy inhibitors, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or chloroquine (CQ), promoted the accumulation of DPCs in damaged cells and injured organs. siRNA-mediated silencing of Atg5 or Atg7, two essential components for the formation of the autophagosome, gave similar results. In contrast, the autophagy inducer rapamycin (RAP) attenuated DPCs in vitro and in vivo.

Many recent studies have found that mequindox is rapidly metabolized to numerous metabolites following administration to animals.

In this study, HepG2 cells were treated with mequindox (0, 2, 10, 50 or 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) or its major metabolites (0, 40, 100, 250 or 500\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 24\u00a0h. Mice were administrated with mequindox (0, 50, 200 or 500\u00a0mg/kg.bw) for five days. DNA damage in the HepG2 cells and mouse hepatocytes was then assessed using an SCGE assay. The cell cycle of the HepG2 cells was also determined by flow cytometry. Mequindox was found to induce cell cycle arrest to the G2/M phase and cause dose-dependent DNA damage in HepG2 cells in vitro and in murine hepatocytes in vivo. Compared with mequindox, the major metabolites had much smaller effects on the cell cycle and caused much less DNA damage in HepG2 cells. And the results indicated that the process of metabolites formed by reduction of the MEQ acetyl group or reduction of the N\u00a0\u2192\u00a0O groups could contribute to DNA damage in murine hepatocytes in vivo.",

Commercially available amorphous SiNPs (12\u00a0nm, 5\u201310\u00a0nm, and 10\u201315\u00a0nm) and micrometer sized (SiP2\u00a0\u03bcm) silica were characterised for size, chemical composition, and aggregation state. Mouse lung epithelial (FE1) cells derived from Muta\u2122Mouse were exposed to various concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) of SiNPs and SiP2\u00a0\u03bcm. Cellular viability, clonogenic potential, oxidative stress, micronucleus formation, and mutant frequency were measured at different post-exposure time points. Cellular internalization of particles was assessed using nanoscale hyperspectral microscopy. Biological pathway and functional perturbations were assessed using DNA microarrays. Detailed characterization of particles confirmed their size, purity, and uniform dispersion in the exposure medium. Decreased cellular viability was observed acutely at 24\u00a0h at concentrations higher than 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for all particle types, with SiNPs being the most sensitive; loss of viability was surface area dependent at the lowest concentration tested. However, only SiNP12 showed poor long-term survival. A size-dependent increase in micronucleus formation was also observed for SiNPs. In contrast to the viability results, SiP2\u00a0\u03bcm exhibited the highest potential to induce oxidative stress compared to the SiNPs at all tested concentrations. Gene ontology and biological pathway analysis revealed significant changes in the expression of genes implicated in lysosomal functions in SiNP12-treated cells, which appear closely associated with higher SiNP12 internalization and lysosomal rearrangements in the cytoplasm of these cells. These results suggest that SiNPs induce cellular and genetic toxicity in a size-dependent manner and that the observed toxicity may be the results of higher particle internalization of smaller SiNP and subsequent lysosomal overload.",

On the other hand, the genotoxic potential of those substances has not been investigated in SHE cells. And yet, genotoxicity assays are commonly used for hazard evaluation and they are often used as in vitro assays of reference to predict a possible carcinogenic potential. The main objective of this study was to compare the genotoxic potential and the carcinogenic potential of different crystalline and amorphous silica particles in SHE cells. Three silica samples of different crystallinity were used: natural amorphous silica, partially crystallized silica and quartz silica particles. Their genotoxicity were tested through the in vitro micronucleus assay and the comet assay in SHE, and their carcinogenic potential through the SHE transformation assay. In addition, silica samples were also tested with the same genotoxicity assays in V79 hamster-lung cells, a common in vitro model for particle exposure.Results obtained in the micronucleus and the comet assays show that none of the silica was capable of inducing genotoxic effects in SHE cells and only the amorphous silica induced genotoxic effects in V79 cells. However in the SHE cell transformation assays, the partially crystallized and quartz silica were able to induce morphological cell transformation. Together, these data suggest that, in vitro, the short-term genotoxic assays alone are not sufficient to predict the hazard and the carcinogenic potential of this type of particles; SHE transformation assay appears a more reliable tool for this purpose and should be included in the \u201cin vitro battery assays\u201d for hazard assessment.",

The levels of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 in the high and moderate groups were significantly higher than in the control group. The DNA methylation levels were not significantly different between spring and autumn.

Prolonged exposure to a high level of TRAP was negatively associated with LINE-1 and iNOS methylation, and positively associated with APC methylations in the DNA from lung tissues but not blood.

To reduce false\u2013positive results, the new Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guideline (TG) recommends the use of a new cytotoxicity index, relative increase in cell count or relative population doubling (RICC/RPD), instead of the traditionally used index, relative cell count (RCC). Although the use of the RICC/RPD may result in different outcomes and require re-evaluation of tested substances, it is impractical to re-evaluate all existing data. Therefore, we established a method to estimate test results from existing RCC data. First, we developed formulae to estimate RICC/RPD from RCC without cell counts by considering cell doubling time and experiment time. Next, the accuracy of the cytotoxicity index transformation formulae was verified by comparing estimated RICC/RPD and measured RICC/RPD for 3 major chemicals associated with false\u2013positive genotoxicity test results: ethyl acrylate, eugenol and p-nitrophenol. Moreover, 25 compounds with false\u2013positive in vitro chromosomal aberration (CA) test results were re-evaluated to establish a retrospective evaluation method based on derived estimated RICC/RPD values. The estimated RICC/RPD values were in good agreement with the measured RICC/RPD values for every concentration and chemical, and the estimated RICC suggested the possibility that 12 chemicals (48%) with previously judged false\u2013positive results in fact had negative results. Our method enables transformation of RCC data into RICC/RPD values with a high degree of accuracy and will facilitate comprehensive retrospective evaluation of test results.",

     "abstract": "In this study we investigated the feasibility of high-throughput (96-well plate) umu assay to test the genotoxic effect of TiO2 engineered nanoparticles (ENPs) under UV light (full spectrum) and visible light (455\u00a0nm). Exposure of TiO2 ENPs to up to 60\u00a0min of UV light induced a photocatalytic production of ROS. However, UV light itself caused cytotoxic damage to Salmonella typhimurium at exposures >15\u00a0min and a genotoxic effect at exposures >0.5\u00a0min; and use of UV filters did not lower this effect. No genotoxicity of TiO2 ENPs was observed under visible light conditions at concentrations up to 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u22121; or under dark conditions at concentrations up to 667\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0mL\u22121, though cytotoxicity was seen at the higher concentrations. Additionally, the growth factor calculation was influenced by a shading effect due to ENPs, and was corrected by considering the pre-incubation OD readings of Plate B. Recommendations provided in this paper, as well as investigation of the effect of the light sources should be considered when using the umu assay to quantify the photo-genotoxicity of engineered nanomaterials.",

Although cellular radiosensitivity relies on cell cycle status, it is largely unknown how about the relationship between RIBE and cell cycle distribution, much less the underlying mechanism. In the present study, the lung cancer A549 cells were synchronized into different cell cycle phases of G1, S and G2/M and irradiated with high linear energy transfer (LET) carbon ions. By treating nonirradiated cells with the conditioned medium from these irradiated cells, it was found that the G2-M phase cells had the largest contribution to RIBE. Meanwhile, the activity of DNA-PKcs but not ATM was increased in the synchronized G2-M phase cells in spite of both of them were activated in the asynchronous cells after carbon ion irradiation. When the G2-M phased cells were transferred with DNA-PKcs siRNA and ATM siRNA individually or treated with an inhibitor of either DNA-PKcs or ATM before carbon ion irradiation, the RIBE was effectively diminished. These results provide new evidence linking cell cycle to bystander responses and demonstrate that DNA-PKcs and ATM are two associated factors in co-regulating G2-M phase-related bystander effects.",

The possible involvement of DNA repair-related genes in long-term low-dose-rate neutron-gamma radiation exposure is poorly understood. In this study, 60 rats were divided into control groups and irradiated groups, which were exposed to low-dose-rate n-\u03b3 combined radiation (LDCR) for 15, 30, or 60 days. The effects of different cumulative radiation doses on peripheral blood cell (PBC), subsets of T cells of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and DNA damage repair were investigated. Real-time PCR and immunoblot analyses were used to detect expression of DNA DSB-repair-related genes involved in the NHEJ pathway, such as Ku70 and Ku80, in PBL. The mRNA level of H2AX and the expression level of \u03b3-H2AX were detected by real-time PCR, immunoblot, and flow cytometry. White blood cells (WBC) and platelets (PLT) of all ionizing radiation (IR) groups decreased significantly, while no difference was seen between the 30 day and 60 day exposure groups. The numbers of CD3+, CD4+ T cells and CD4+/CD8+ in the PBL of IR groups were lower than in the control group. In the 30 day and 60 day exposure groups, CD8+ T cells decreased significantly. Real-time PCR and immunoblot results showed no significant difference in the mRNA and protein expression of Ku70 and Ku80 between the control groups and IR groups. However, the mRNA of H2AX increased significantly, and there was a positive correlation with dose. There was no difference in the protein expression of \u03b3-H2AX between 30 day and 60 day groups, which may help to explain the damage to PBL. In conclusion, PBL damage increased with cumulative dose, suggesting that \u03b3-H2AX, but neither Ku70 nor Ku80, plays an important role in PBL impairment induced by LDCR.",

These lines are used frequently in genotoxicity studies and in studies aimed at understanding the role of p53 in DNA repair. Despite their routine use, little is known about the genetic status of these cells. To provide insight into their genetic composition, we sequenced and analyzed the entire genome of TK6 cells, as well as the normalized transcriptomes of TK6, WTK1, and NH32 cells. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified 21,561 genes and 5.17\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 small variants. Within the small variants, 50.54% were naturally occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 49.46% were mutations. The mutations were comprised of 92.97% single base-pair substitutions and 7.03% insertions or deletions (indels). The number of predicted genes, SNPs, and small mutations are similar to frequencies observed in the human population in general. Normalized mRNA-seq analysis identified the expression of transcripts bearing SNPs or mutations for TK6, WTK1, and NH32 as 2.88%, 2.04%, and 1.71%, respectively, and several of the variant transcripts identified appear to have important implications in genetic toxicology. These include a single base deletion mutation in the ferritin heavy chain gene (FTH1) resulting in a frame shift and protein truncation in TK6 that impairs iron metabolism. SNPs in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) gene (TPMT*3A SNP), and in the xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme, NADPH quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) gene (NQO1*2 SNP), are both associated with decreased enzyme activity.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of Ag NPs (10 and 100\u00a0nm) in two different cell lines, CHO-K1 and CHO-XRS5, by performing cell viability assay (XTT), clonogenic assay, micronucleus test, comet assay, as well as by investigating the cell cycle kinetics using the flow cytometry. Cell cultures were exposed to different concentrations of AgNPs (0.025\u20135.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 24\u00a0h. Our results indicated that cytotoxicity and genotoxicity induced by the 100\u00a0nm-Ag NPs were greater than those induced by the 10\u00a0nm-Ag NPs for both cell lines, which suggests that the exposure to greater size particles (100\u00a0nm) can cause more adverse biological effects than the exposure to the smaller ones (10\u00a0nm).",

In MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, NPEO(15) treatment induced \u03b3-H2AX in a dose-dependent manner. EDTA and ZnCl2, two inhibitors of deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I), inhibited both the \u03b3-H2AX and DNA double-strand breaks induced by NPEO(15). NPEO(15) disrupted filamentous actin and released free DNase I as detected by cell fractionation analysis. Based on immunofluorescence staining of DNase I and monitoring DNase I-GFP localization, DNase I was translocated from the cytosol to the nucleus of cells after treatment with NPEO(15). This translocation did not occur with the common DNA damage inducers ultraviolet B irradiation and hydrogen peroxide. Other surfactants, Tween 20, Triton X-100 and Nonidet P-40, also generated \u03b3-H2AX. These results show that \u03b3-H2AX induction by surfactants including NPEOs, occurs via a new mechanism involving release of free DNase I with actin disruption. This mechanism is distinct from the process of \u03b3-H2AX generation caused by direct chemically induced DNA damage.",

     "abstract": "The response of a cell or tissue to ionizing radiation is mediated by direct damage to cellular components and indirect damage mediated by radiolysis of water. Radiation affects both irradiated cells and the surrounding cells and tissues. The radiation-induced bystander effect is defined by the presence of biological effects in cells that were not themselves in the field of irradiation. To establish the contribution of the bystander effect in the survival of the neighboring cells, lung carcinoma A549 cells were exposed to gamma-irradiation, 2\u00a0Gy. The medium from the irradiated cells was transferred to non-irradiated A549 cells. Irradiated A549 cells as well as non-irradiated A549 cells cultured in the presence of medium from irradiated cells showed decrease in survival and increase in \u03b3-H2AX and p-ATM foci, indicating a bystander effect. Bystander signaling was also observed between different cell types. Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated and gamma-irradiated U937 (human monocyte) cells induced a bystander response in non-irradiated A549 (lung carcinoma) cells as shown by decreased survival and increased \u03b3-H2AX and p-ATM foci. Non-stimulated and/or irradiated U937 cells did not induce such effects in non-irradiated A549 cells.Since ATM protein was activated in irradiated cells as well as bystander cells, it was of interest to understand its role in bystander effect. Suppression of ATM with siRNA in A549 cells completely inhibited bystander effect in bystander A549 cells. On the other hand suppression of ATM with siRNA in PMA stimulated U937 cells caused only a partial inhibition of bystander effect in bystander A549 cells. These results indicate that apart from ATM, some additional factor may be involved in bystander effect between different cell types.",

The aim of this study was to further explore the induction of genomic instability by ELF MFs by increasing the follow-up time up to 45 days after exposure. Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed to a 50\u00a0Hz, 100\u00a0\u03bcT MF for 24\u00a0h with or without co-exposure to menadione (MQ), a chemical agent that increases cellular superoxide production. Micronuclei, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation (LPO) were measured at 15, 30 and 45 days after exposure. To study the possible causal role of ROS in the delayed effects of MF, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was administered before MF exposure. Consistently with the previous study, the level of micronuclei was statistically significantly elevated 15 days after exposure. A similar effect was observed at 30 days, but not at 45 days after exposure. The level of LPO was statically significantly decreased 30 and 45 days after exposure. Consistently with our previous findings, the MF effect did not depend on co-exposure to MQ. Treatment with NAC effectively decreased cellular ROS level and suppressed the effect of MQ on ROS, but it did not block the MF effect, indicating that increase in ROS is not needed as a causal link between MF exposure and induction of delayed effects. The results presented here are consistent with genomic instability that persists in the progeny of MF-exposed cells up to at least 30 days after exposure. Changes in LPO observed at 30 and 45 days after exposure indicates that the MF-initiated process may continue up to at least 45 days after exposure.",

E. fetida were exposed to different doses of gamma radiation, i.e., 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50\u00a0Gy, and comet assay was performed for all the doses along with control at 1, 3 and 5\u00a0h post irradiation to evaluate the genotoxicity of gamma radiation in this organism. The DNA damage was measured as percentage of comet tail DNA. A significant increase in DNA damage was observed in samples exposed to 5\u00a0Gy and above, and the increase in DNA damage was dose dependent i.e., DNA damage was increased with increased doses of radiation. The highest DNA damage was noticed at 1\u00a0h post irradiation and gradually decreased with time, i.e., at 3 and 5\u00a0h post irradiation. The present study reveals that gamma radiation induces DNA damage in E. fetida and the comet assay is a sensitive and rapid method for its detection to detect genotoxicity of gamma radiation.",

In the Alkaline unwinding assay (with V79 cells), only 15\u00a0nm-SiO2 significantly increased DNA strand breaks (and only at 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL), whereas neither nanomaterial (up to 300\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) increased Fpg (Formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase)-sensitive sites reflecting oxidative DNA base modifications. In the Comet assay using rat precision-cut lung slices, 15\u00a0nm-SiO2 and 55\u00a0nm-SiO2 induced significant DNA damage at \u2265100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. In the Alkaline unwinding assay (with A549 cells), 30\u00a0nm-SiO2 and 55\u00a0nm-SiO2 (with larger primary particle size (PPS)) induced significant increases in DNA strand breaks at \u226550\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, whereas 9\u00a0nm-SiO2 and 15\u00a0nm-SiO2 (with smaller PPS) induced significant DNA damage at higher concentrations. These two amorphous SiO2 also increased Fpg-sensitive sites (significant at 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). In vivo, within 3 days after single intratracheal instillation of 360\u00a0\u03bcg, neither 15\u00a0nm-SiO2 nor 55\u00a0nm-SiO2 caused genotoxic effects in the rat lung or in the bone marrow. However, pulmonary inflammation was observed in both test groups with findings being more pronounced upon treatment with 15\u00a0nm-SiO2 than with 55\u00a0nm-SiO2. Taken together, the study shows that colloidal amorphous SiO2 with different particle sizes may induce genotoxic effects in lung cells in vitro at comparatively high concentrations. However, the same materials elicited no genotoxic effects in the rat lung even though pronounced pulmonary inflammation evolved. This may be explained by the fact that a considerably lower dose reached the target cells in vivo than in vitro. Additionally, the different time points of investigation may provide more time for DNA damage repair after instillation.",

A longitudinal study was conducted with repeated measurements during spermatogenesis. Coke-oven workers (n\u00a0=\u00a0112) from a coke-oven plant served the PAH-exposed group, while administrators and security personnel (n\u00a0=\u00a067) served the control. Routine semen parameters (concentration, motility, vitality, and morphology) were analyzed simultaneously; the assessment of sperm DNA integrity endpoints included DNA fragmentation, bulky DNA adducts, and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo). The degree of sperm DNA fragmentation was measured using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) assay and sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA). The PAH-exposed group had a significant increase in bulky DNA adducts and 8-oxo-dGuo compared to the control subjects (Ps\u00a0=\u00a00.002 and 0.045, respectively). Coke oven workers\u2019 percentages of DNA fragmentation and denaturation from the PAH-exposed group were not significantly different from those of the control subjects (Ps\u00a0=\u00a00.232 and 0.245, respectively). Routine semen parameters and DNA integrity endpoints were not correlated. Concentrations of 8-oxo-dGuo were positively correlated with percentages of DNA fragmentation measured by both TUNEL and SCSA (Ps\u00a0=\u00a00.045 and 0.034, respectively). However, the concentrations of 8-oxo-dGuo and percentages of DNA fragmentation did not correlate with concentrations of bulky DNA adducts. In summary, coke oven workers with chronic exposure to PAHs experienced decreased sperm DNA integrity. Oxidative stress could contribute to the degree of DNA fragmentation. Bulky DNA adducts may be independent of the formation of DNA fragmentation and oxidative adducts in sperm. Monitoring sperm DNA integrity is recommended as a part of the process of assessing the impact of occupational and environmental toxins on sperm.",

A reference dose response curve was constructed using blood samples from a female donor whose lymphocytes consistently exhibited a low frequency of cells at the second mitosis under routine culture conditions. Aberration yields were studied for a total of about 155 thousand metaphases obtained from seven dose-points of gamma irradiations (0, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300\u00a0mGy). In situ hybridization was performed using commercially available painting probes for chromosomes 1, 2 and 4. With the aid of an automated image-capturing method, exchange-type aberrations involving painted chromosomes were detected with considerable accuracy and speed. The results on the exchange-type aberrations (dicentrics plus translocations) at the seven dose-points showed a good fit to the linear-quadratic model (y\u00a0=\u00a00.0023\u00a0+\u00a00.0015x\u00a0+\u00a00.0819x2, P\u00a0=\u00a00.83).

     "abstract": "Ionizing radiation (IR) induces double strand breaks (DSBs) in cellular DNA, which if not repaired correctly can cause chromosome translocations leading to cell death or cancer. Incorrect joining of DNA ends generating chromosome translocations can be catalyzed either by the dominant DNA-PKcs-dependent, classical non-homologous end-joining (c-NHEJ), or by an alternative end-joining (alt-EJ) process, functioning as backup to abrogated c-NHEJ, or homologous recombination repair. Alt-EJ operates with slower kinetics as compared to c-NHEJ and generates larger alterations at the junctions; it is also considered crucial to chromosome translocation-formation. A recent report posits that this view only holds for rodent cells and that in human cells c-NHEJ is the main mechanism of chromosome translocation formation. Since this report uses designer nucleases that induce DSBs with unique characteristics in specific genomic locations and PCR to detect translocations, we revisit the issue using stochastically distributed DSBs induced in the human genome by IR during the G2-phase of the cell cycle. For visualization and analysis of chromosome translocations, which manifest as chromatid translocations in cells irradiated in G2, we employ classical cytogenetics. In wild-type cells, we observe a significant contribution of alt-EJ to translocation formation, as demonstrated by a yield-reduction after treatment with inhibitors of Parp, or of DNA ligases 1 and 3 (Lig1, Lig3). Notably, a nearly fourfold increase in translocation formation is seen in c-NHEJ mutants with defects in DNA ligase 4 (Lig4) that remain largely sensitive to inhibitors of Parp, and of Lig1/Lig3. We conclude that similar to rodent cells, chromosome translocation formation from randomly induced DSBs in human cells largely relies on alt-EJ. We discuss DSB localization in the genome, characteristics of the DSB and the cell cycle as potential causes of the divergent results generated with IR and designer nucleases.",

In this study ICRF-187 was used to evaluate the potential involvement of DNA topoisomerase II in the formation of the radiation-induced chromosome-type aberrations in the G0 phase of the cell cycle in human lymphocytes from three healthy male donors. This is based on many evidences that DNA topoisomerases are involved in DNA recombination, mainly of illegitimate type (non-homologous) both in vitro and in vivo. The results obtained clearly indicated that ICRF-187 did not induce per se any chromosomal damage. When challenged with the non-catalytic Topo II poison VP-16 (etoposide), which acts by stabilizing the \u201ccleavable complex\u201d generating \u201cprotein concealed\u201d DSB\u2019s and thus chromosomal aberrations, it completely abolished the significant induction of chromosome-type aberrations and formation of dicentric chromosomes.

On the other hand, when X-ray treatments were challenged with ICRF-187 using experimental conditions as for VP-16 treatments, no modification of the incidence of chromosome-type aberrations and dicentric chromosomes was observed. On this basis, we conclude that Topo II is not involved in the formation of X-ray-induced chromosome-type aberrations and dicentric chromosomes in human lymphocytes in the G0 phase of the cell cycle.",

     "abstract": "Temozolomide (TMZ) is widely used for patients with glioblastoma (GBM); however, tumor cells frequently exhibit drug-resistance. Base excision repair (BER) has been identified as a possible mediator of TMZ resistance, and an attractive approach to sensitizing cells to chemotherapy. Human apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor-1 (APE1) is an essential enzyme with a role in the BER pathway by repairing abasic sites, and it also acts as a reduction factor, maintaining transcription factors in an active reduced state. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether the down-regulation of APE1 expression by siRNA can interfere with the resistance of GBM to TMZ, being evaluated by several cellular and molecular parameters. We demonstrated that APE1 knockdown associated with TMZ treatment efficiently reduced cell proliferation and clonogenic survival of resistant cells (T98G), which appears to be a consequence of increased DNA damage, S-phase arrest, and H2AX phosphorylation, resulting in apoptosis induction. On the contrary, for those assays, the sensitization effects of APE1 silencing plus TMZ treatment did not occur in the TMZ-sensitive cell line (U87MG). Interestingly, TMZ-treatment and APE1 knockdown significantly reduced cell invasion in both cell lines, but TMZ alone did not reduce the invasion capacity of U87MG cells, as observed for T98G. We also found that VEGF expression was down-regulated by TMZ treatment in T98G cells, regardless of APE1 knockdown, but U87MG showed a different response, since APE1 silencing counteracted VEGF induction promoted by TMZ, suggesting that the APE1-redox function may play an indirect role, depending on the cell line. The present results support the contribution of BER in the GBM resistance to TMZ, with a greater effect in TMZ-resistant, compared with TMZ-sensitive cells, emphasizing that APE1 can be a promising target for modifying TMZ tolerance. Furthermore, genetic characteristics of tumor cells should be considered as critical information to select an appropriate therapeutic strategy.",

     "abstract": "In conventional experiments on biological effects of radiation types of diverse quality, micrometer-scale double-strand break (DSB) clustering is inherently interlinked with clustering of energy deposition events on nanometer scale relevant for DSB induction. Due to this limitation, the role of the micrometer and nanometer scales in diverse biological endpoints cannot be fully separated. To address this issue, hybrid human-hamster AL cells have been irradiated with 45\u00a0MeV (60\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) lithium ions or 20\u00a0MeV (2.6\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) protons quasi-homogeneously distributed or focused to 0.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcm2 spots on regular matrix patterns (point distances up to 10.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010.6\u00a0\u03bcm), with pre-defined particle numbers per spot to provide the same mean dose of 1.7\u00a0Gy. The yields of dicentrics and their distribution among cells have been scored. In parallel, track-structure based simulations of DSB induction and chromosome aberration formation with PARTRAC have been performed. The results show that the sub-micrometer beam focusing does not enhance DSB yields, but significantly affects the DSB distribution within the nucleus and increases the chance to form DSB pairs in close proximity, which may lead to increased yields of chromosome aberrations. Indeed, the experiments show that focusing 20 lithium ions or 451 protons per spot on a 10.6\u00a0\u03bcm grid induces two or three times more dicentrics, respectively, than a quasi-homogenous irradiation. The simulations reproduce the data in part, but in part suggest more complex behavior such as saturation or overkill not seen in the experiments. The direct experimental demonstration that sub-micrometer clustering of DSB plays a critical role in the induction of dicentrics improves the knowledge on the mechanisms by which these lethal lesions arise, and indicates how the assumptions of the biophysical model could be improved. It also provides a better understanding of the increased biological effectiveness of high-LET radiation.",

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCCVII) cells were transplanted into the right hind legs of syngeneic C3H/He male mice. Irradiation doses with either X-rays or heavy ions at a dose-averaged LET (linear energy transfer) of 14\u2013192\u00a0keV/\u03bcm were delivered to 5-mm diameter tumors and aerobic single-cells in sample-tubes.

After X-irradiation, the OERh/n values (hypoxic tumor/normoxic tumor) were lower than the OERh/a (hypoxic tumor/aerobic cells), and were 1.73 and 2.58, respectively. We found that the OER for the in vivo studies were smaller in comparison to that for the in vitro studies. Both of the OER values at 192\u00a0keV/\u03bcm were small in comparison to those of the X-ray irradiated samples.

     "abstract": "Leukaemia is the prevailing neoplastic disorder of the hematopoietic system. Epidemiological analyses of the survivors of the Japanese atomic bombings show that exposure to ionising radiation (IR) can cause leukaemia. Although a clear association between radiation exposure and leukaemia development is acknowledged, the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. A hemizygous deletion on mouse chromosome 2 (del2) is a common feature in several mouse strains susceptible to radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (rAML). The deletion is an early event detectable 24\u00a0h after exposure in bone marrow cells. Ultimately, 15\u201325% of exposed animals develop AML with 80\u201390% of cases carrying del2. Molecular mapping of leukaemic cell genomes identified a minimal deleted region (MDR) on chromosome 2 (chr2) in which a tumour suppressor gene, Sfpi1 is located, encoding the transcription factor PU.1, essential in haematopoiesis. The remaining copy of Sfpi1 has a point mutation in the coding sequence for the DNA-binding domain of the protein in 70% of rAML, which alters a single CpG sequence in the codon for arginine residue R235. In order to identify chr2 deletions and Sfpi.1/PU.1 loss, we performed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) on a unique panel of 79rAMLs. Using a custom made CGH array specifically designed for mouse chr2, we analysed at unprecedentedly high resolution (1.4\u00a0M array- 148\u00a0bp resolution) the size of the MDR in low LET and high-LET induced rAMLs (32 X-ray- and 47 neutron-induced). Sequencing of Sfpi1/PU.1DNA binding domain identified the presence of R235 point mutations, showing no influence of radiation quality on R235 type or frequency. We identified for the first time rAML cases with complex del2 in a subset of neutron-induced AMLs. This study allowed us to re-define the MDR to a much smaller 5.5\u00a0Mb region (still including Sfpi1/PU.1), identical regardless of radiation quality.",

The data indicate that the induction of chromosomal exchanges was influenced by both Linear energy transfer (LET) and particle types. Moreover, the complex-to-simple exchanges ratio (C-ratio) and interchromosome to intrachromosome exchanges ratio (F-ratio) were evaluated by mFISH and mBAND techniques, respectively. Our results indicate that the C-ratio is a more reliable marker of radiation quality, with values that increased linearly in an LET-dependent manner.In addition, by means of mBAND analysis, the distribution of radiation-induced breakpoints along chromosome 1 was analyzed and compared with the expected distributions of the breaks. The expected values were calculated assuming a random distribution of the breakpoints. The data indicate that, irrespective of the radiation that was used, the breakpoints were non-randomly distributed along chromosome 1. In particular, breaks in the pericentromeric region were encountered at a higher frequency than expected. A deeper analysis revealed that breaks were not located in the constitutive heterochromatin (G-bands 1p11/1q11 and 1q12), but rather in a region comprised between 1p11.2 and 1p22.1, which includes G-light and G-dark bands.",

Following standard cytogenetic procedure, at least 100 metaphases were analysed microscopically for each activity concentration. Cell death was measured by apoptosis assay using flow cytometry. Radiation doses were determined by using point kernel calculations.After 18\u00a0h labelling with 125I-UdR the cell cycle distribution is severely disturbed. About 40% of PBL are fully labelled and 20% show a moderate labelling of 125I-UdR, whereas 40% of cells remain un-labelled. The dose-response relationship fits to a polynomial curve in the low dose range, whereas a linear fit supplies a better estimation in the high dose range. Even the lowest dose of 0.2\u00a0Gy leads to a 13-fold increase of aberrations compared to the controls. On average every fifth 125I-decay produces a single chromatid aberration in PBL. Additionally, a dose-dependent increase of cell death is observed.125I-UdR has a very strong genotoxic capacity in human PBL, even at 0.2\u00a0Gy. Efficiently labelled cells displaying a prolonged cell cycle compared to moderately labelled cells and cell death contribute substantially to the desynchronisation of the cell cycle. Our data, showing for the first time, that one 125I-decay induces \u223c 0.2 chromatid aberrations, are in very good accordance to DSB data, stating that \u223c0.26 DSB are induced per decay, indicating that approximately every DSB is converted into a chromatid aberration.",

     "abstract": "The dual role of caffeine as a chromosomal damage inducer and G2/M-checkpoint abrogator is well known but it is observed mainly at relatively high concentrations. At low concentrations, caffeine enhances the cytogenetic effects of several carcinogens and its intake during pregnancy has been recently reported to cause adverse birth outcomes. Interestingly, a threshold below which this association is not apparent was not identified. Since chromosomal abnormalities and aneuploidy are the major genetic etiologies of spontaneous abortions and adverse birth outcomes, we re-evaluate here the effects of caffeine at the cytogenetic level and propose a model for the mechanisms involved. Our hypothesis is that low caffeine concentrations affect DNA replication and cause chromosomal aberrations and asymmetric cell divisions not easily detected at metaphase since damaged cells are delayed during their G2/M-phase transition and the low caffeine concentrations cannot abrogate the G2-checkpoint. To test this hypothesis, caffeine-induced chromatid breaks and micronuclei in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were evaluated in vitro after low caffeine concentration exposures, followed by a short treatment with 4\u00a0mM of caffeine to abrogate the G2-checkpoint. The results show a statistically significant increase in chromatid breaks at caffeine concentrations \u22651\u00a0mM. When caffeine was applied for G2/M-checkpoint abrogation, a statistically significant increase in chromatid breaks, compared to an active checkpoint, was only observed at 4\u00a0mM of caffeine. The potential of low concentrations to induce asymmetric cell divisions was tested by applying a methodology combining the cytochalasin-B mediated cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN) with interphase FISH (iFISH), using selected centromeric probes. Interestingly, low caffeine concentrations induce a dose dependent aneuploidy through asymmetric cell divisions, which are caused by misalignment of chromosomes through a mechanism unrelated to the formation of chromatid breaks. The cytogenetic approach used, combining CBMN with iFISH, is proposed as a valuable tool to test chemically induced asymmetric cell divisions.",

Pre-, post- and simultaneous treatments with GLEx or 6-G and the carcinogens were carried out. Both GLEx post- and simultaneous treatments reduced the frequencies of MN induced by MNNG and DMBA. Probably this effect is due to an increase of cytostasis and a physico-chemical interaction between GLEx and DMBA under simultaneous treatment. Pre- and simultaneous treatments with 6-G significantly reduced the yield of MNNG-induced micronuclei without affecting % of cytostasis. Simultaneous treatment with 6-G plus DMBA resulted in reduction in the frequency of MN and an increase in cytotoxicity compared to sample treated alone with DMBA, whereas a post-treatment, caused a significant decrease in the yield of MN compared with DMBA alone without any cytotoxic effect. These results are compared with our earlier data obtained in the same system with other phytochemicals.

In the current study, anti-cancer properties of plumbagin, a plant-derived naphthoquinone, on brain cancer cells were determined. Plumbagin treatment resulted in the induction of DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, followed by suppression of the colony forming ability of the brain tumour cells. These effects were substantiated by upregulation of PTEN, TNFRSF1A and downregulation of E2F1 genes, along with a drop in MDM2, cyclin B1, survivin and BCL2 protein expression. Plumbagin induced elevated levels of caspase-3/7 activity as well. For the first time, we show here that plumbagin inhibits telomerase in brain tumour cells and results in telomere shortening following chronic long-term treatment. This observation implies considerable cytotoxicity of plumbagin towards cancer cells with higher telomerase activity.

     "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that low temperature (hypothermia) at exposure can act in a radio-protective manner at the level of cytogenetic damage. The mechanisms of this phenomenon are not understood, but it was suggested to be due to hypothermia-induced perturbations of the cell cycle. The purpose of the present study was to detect whether a reduced frequency of micronuclei is observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) irradiated at low temperature and harvested sequentially at 3 time points. Additionally, the level of apoptosis was estimated by microscopic analysis of the MN slides.Experiments were carried out with blood drawn from three donors at the Stockholm University and from three donors at the Jan Kochanowski University. Prior to irradiation, blood samples were incubated for 20\u00a0min and irradiated at the respective temperature (0\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C) with gamma rays. Whole blood cultures were set up, cytochalasin B was added after 44\u00a0h of irradiation and the samples were harvested after 72, 96 and 120\u00a0h of incubation time.The frequency of micronuclei was markedly lower in PBL harvested at 72\u00a0h, 96\u00a0h and 120\u00a0h following irradiation at 0\u00a0\u00b0C as compared to 37\u00a0\u00b0C. This indicates that the temperature effect observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes after irradiation is not related to a temporary perturbation of the cell cycle. Also, it is not due to selective elimination of damaged cells by apoptosis.",

It is believed that this long-lasting damage is most likely to lead to an increased risk to the health of the astronauts during long-term flights (lasting 6 months or more).The complexity of damage that results from protracted, non-homogeneous radiation exposure, like that found in the space environment, requires a detailed scoring schematic to capture as much information as possible.

     "abstract": "The frequency of dicentric chromosomes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes at metaphase is considered as the \u201cgold-standard\u201d method for biological dosimetry and, presently, it is the most widely used for dose assessment. Yet, it needs lymphocyte stimulation and a 2-day culture, failing the requirement of rapid dose estimation, which is a high priority in radiation emergency medicine and triage biodosimetry. In the present work, we assess the applicability of cell fusion mediated premature chromosome condensation (PCC) methodology, which enables the analysis of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations directly in non-stimulated G0-lymphocytes, without the 2-day culture delay. Despite its advantages, quantification of an exposure by means of the PCC-method is not currently widely used, mainly because Giemsa-staining of interphase G0-lymphocyte chromosomes facilitates the analysis of fragments and rings, but not of dicentrics. To overcome this shortcoming, the PCC-method is combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), using simultaneously centromeric/telomeric peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-probes. This new approach enables an accurate analysis of dicentric and centric ring chromosomes, which are formed within 8\u00a0h post irradiation and will, therefore, be present in the blood sample by the time it arrives for dose estimation. For triage biodosimetry, a dose response curve for up to 10\u00a0Gy was constructed and compared to that obtained using conventional metaphase analysis with Giemsa or centromeric/telomeric PNA-probes in metaphase. Since FISH is labor intensive, a simple PCC-method scoring Giemsa-stained fragments in excess of 46 was also assessed as an even more rapid approach for triage biodosimetry. First, we studied the rejoining kinetics of fragments and constructed a dose-response curve for 24\u00a0h repair time. Then, its applicability was assessed for four different doses and compared with the PCC-method using centromeric/telomeric PNA-probes, through the evaluation of speed of analysis and minimum number of cells required for dose estimation and categorization of exposed individuals.",

     "abstract": "Every year, many countries perform a significant number of investigations based on biological radiation dose assessment to check suspected or true overexposure by irradiation of radiation workers and individuals of the general population. The scoring of dicentrics in peripheral blood lymphocytes has gradually become the \u201cgold standard\u201d for the biodosimetry-based assessment of accidental situations. Nevertheless, other \u201cclassical\u201d biodosimetric methods such as micronuclei, prematurely condensed chromosomes (PCC) and FISH translocations are relevant in some exposure situations, also for surveillance of groups of populations at risk. Historical international intercomparison studies have shown discrepancies among dose\u2013effect curves used to estimate doses from blood samples irradiated between 0 and 4\u00a0Gy. Recent experimental work performed by the biological dosimetry laboratory of the French Institute for Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (IRSN) has shown the impact of some blood harvesting parameters on the mitotic index, and consequently on the quality of dose assessment. Therefore, it was relevant to define the best Quality Assurance (QA) and Quality Control (QC) criteria to harmonize protocols among biodosimetry laboratories. Complementary with several editions of an IAEA technical manual, ISO standards were written with the view of considering the most used chromosome aberrations assays: dicentrics and micronuclei. An important feature of these standards is to address the organization of population triage and laboratories networking that would be required in case of a large nuclear event or malicious act involving radioactive material. These ISO standards are relevant and helpful to implement a coordinated response of several biodosimetry networks in Europe, Japan, Canada, and to support European programs such as MULTIBIODOSE and RENEB. A new important ISO standard on the use of FISH translocations in retrospective dosimetry is now being drafted.",

     "abstract": "The phosphorylation of the H2AX histone to form \u03b3H2AX foci has been shown to be an accurate biomarker of ionizing radiation exposure. It is well established that there is a one-to-one correlation between the number of \u03b3H2AX foci and radiation-induced double strand breaks in cellular DNA, which can be translated to the received dose. However, manual counting of foci is time-consuming, and cannot accommodate high throughput analysis required to obtain rapid results for medical triage purposes in the case of large-scale accidental exposure. Furthermore, the accuracy of \u03b3H2AX measurements could potentially be compromised by delays between the time of exposure and analysis of results, as well as inter-cellular and inter-individual variability of this biological response. To evaluate more rapid approaches of quantifying \u03b3H2AX for use in an emergency situation, and to determine the impact of inter-individual variability, we compared two methods of global \u03b3H2AX fluorescence quantification (low magnification immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry) to the well-established \u03b3H2AX foci scoring method in human primary fibroblasts. All three approaches were well correlated, indicating that global \u03b3H2AX fluorescence measurements are suitable for dose estimation. For rapid triage in an emergency situation, we propose the use of flow cytometry, as it is more highly correlated with foci scoring and because of the speed and ease of the method. Dose response curves (0.25\u20136\u00a0Gy) using flow cytometry measurements showed that inter-individual variability in global \u03b3H2AX fluorescence is statistically insignificant at 4\u00a0h post-irradiation. Based on these data, we propose calibration curves that can be applied to populations exposed to moderate radiation doses to estimate individual received doses, independent of individual radiosensitivity, at this specific time point post-irradiation using human fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Furthermore, we define three triage categories that could facilitate immediate and follow-up care in the case of a radiological accident.",

Cytogenetic assays such as the Dicentric Chromosome Assay (DCA) are recognized as the gold standard by international regulatory authorities. DCA is a multi-step and multi-day bioassay. DCA, as described in the IAEA manual, can be used to assess dose up to 4\u20136 weeks post-exposure quite accurately but throughput is still a major issue and automation is very essential. The throughput is limited, both in terms of sample preparation as well as analysis of chromosome aberrations. Thus, there is a need to design and develop novel solutions that could utilize extensive laboratory automation for sample preparation, and bioinformatics approaches for chromosome-aberration analysis to overcome throughput issues. We have transitioned the bench-based cytogenetic DCA to a coherent process performing high-throughput automated biodosimetry for individual dose assessment ensuring quality control (QC) and quality assurance (QA) aspects in accordance with international harmonized protocols. A Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is designed, implemented and adapted to manage increased sample processing capacity, develop and maintain standard operating procedures (SOP) for robotic instruments, avoid data transcription errors during processing, and automate analysis of chromosome-aberrations using an image analysis platform. Our efforts described in this paper intend to bridge the current technological gaps and enhance the potential application of DCA for a dose-based stratification of subjects following a mass casualty. This paper describes one such potential integrated automated laboratory system and functional evolution of the classical DCA towards increasing critically needed throughput.",

A telomerase immortalized human fibroblast cell line (F11hT) was used in the experiments. A lentiviral system encoding small hairpin RNAs (shRNA) was used to establish GDF-15 silenced cells. Secreted GDF-15 levels were measured in culture medium by ELISA. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. The experiments demonstrated that in irradiated human fibroblasts GDF-15 expression increased with dose starting from 100\u00a0mGy. Elevated GDF-15 expression was not detected in bystander cells. The potential role of GDF-15 in radiation response was investigated by silencing GDF-15 in immortalized human fibroblasts with five different shRNA encoded in lentiviral vectors. Cell lines with considerably reduced GDF-15 levels presented increased radiation sensitivity, while a cell line with elevated GDF-15 was more radiation resistant than wild type cells. We have investigated how the reduced GDF-15 levels alter the response of several known radiation inducible genes. In F11hT-shGDF-15 cells the basal expression level of CDKN1A was unaltered relative to F11hT cells, while GADD45A and TGF-\u03b21 mRNA levels were slightly higher, and TP53INP1 was considerably reduced. The radiation-induced expression of TP53INP1 was lower in the silenced than in wild type fibroblast cells. Cell cycle analysis indicated that radiation-induced early G2/M arrest was abrogated in GDF-15 silenced cells. Moreover, radiation-induced bystander effect was less pronounced in GDF-15 silenced fibroblasts. In conclusion, the results suggest that GDF-15 works as a radiation inducible radiation resistance increasing factor in normal human fibroblast cells, acts by regulating the radiation-induced transcription of several genes and might serve as a radiation-induced early biomarker in exposed cells.",

This multidisciplinary study focuses on potential genotoxic and cytotoxic effects, evaluated by several end-points, associated with THz radiation. For this purpose, in vitro exposure of human foetal fibroblasts to low frequency THz radiation (0.1\u20130.15\u00a0THz) was performed using a Compact Free Electron Laser.

Moreover, our results indicated an increase in the total number of micronuclei and centromere positive micronuclei induction evaluated by CREST analysis, indicating that THz radiation could induce aneugenic rather than clastogenic effects, probably leading to chromosome loss. Furthermore, an increase of actin polymerization observed by ultrastructural analysis after THz irradiation, supports the hypothesis that an abnormal assembly of spindle proteins could lead to the observed chromosomal malsegregation.",

Here we hypothesize that the formation of several oxidized base damages (from pool and DNA) in close proximity, would cause a high number of base excision repair events, leading to DNA double strand breaks (DSB) and therefore giving rise to cytogenetic damage. If this hypothesis is true, cells with low levels of MTH1 will show higher cytogenetic damage after the longer wave parts of UVR. We analyzed micronuclei induction (MN) as an endpoint for cytogenetic damage in the human lymphoblastoid cell line, TK6, with a normal and a reduced level of MTH1 exposed to UVR. The results indicate a higher level of micronuclei at all incubation times after exposure to the longer wave parts of UVR. There is no significant difference between wildtype and MTH1-knockdown TK6 cells, indicating that MTH1 has no protective role in UVR-induced cytogenetic damage.This indicates that DSBs induced by UV arise from damage forms by direct interaction of UV or ROS with the DNA rather than through oxidation of dNTP.",

     "abstract": "DNA double strand breaks (DSB) are the most deleterious lesions for the integrity of the genome, as their misrepair can lead to the formation of chromosome translocations. Cells have evolved two main repair pathways to suppress the formation of these genotoxic lesions: homology-dependent, error-free homologous recombination repair (HRR), and potentially error-prone, classical, DNA-PK-dependent non-homologous end-joining (c-NHEJ). The most salient feature of c-NHEJ, speed, will largely suppress chromosome translocation formation, while sequence alterations at the junction remain possible. It is now widely accepted that when c-NHEJ is inactivated, globally or locally, an alternative form of end-joining (alt-EJ) removes DSBs. Alt-EJ operates with speed and fidelity markedly lower than c-NHEJ, causing thus with higher probability chromosome translocations, and generating more extensive sequence alterations at the junction. Our working hypothesis is that alt-EJ operates as a backup to c-NHEJ. Recent results show that alt-EJ can also backup abrogated HRR in G2 phase cells, again at the cost of elevated formation of chromosome translocations. These observations raise alt-EJ to a global rescuing mechanism operating on ends that have lost their chromatin context in ways that compromise processing by HRR or c-NHEJ. While responsible for eliminating from the genome highly cytotoxic DNA ends, alt-EJ provides this function at the price of increased translocation formation. Here, we analyze recent literature on the mechanisms of chromosome translocation formation and propose a functional hierarchy among DSB processing pathways that makes alt-EJ the global backup pathway. We discuss possible ramifications of this model in cellular DSB management and pathway choice, and analyze its implications in radiation carcinogenesis and the design of novel therapeutic approaches.",

     "abstract": "Combination of next-generation DNA sequencing, single nucleotide polymorphism array analyses and bioinformatics has revealed the striking phenomenon of chromothripsis, described as complex genomic rearrangements acquired in a single catastrophic event affecting one or a few chromosomes. Via an unproven mechanism, it is postulated that mechanical stress causes chromosome shattering into small lengths of DNA, which are then randomly reassembled by DNA repair machinery. Chromothripsis is currently examined as an alternative mechanism of oncogenesis, in contrast to the present paradigm that considers a stepwise development of cancer. While evidence for the mechanism(s) underlying chromosome shattering during cancer development remains elusive, a number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain chromothripsis, including ionizing radiation, DNA replication stress, breakage\u2013fusion\u2013bridge cycles, micronuclei formation and premature chromosome compaction. In the present work, we provide experimental evidence on the mechanistic basis of chromothripsis and on how chromosomes can get locally shattered in a single catastrophic event. Considering the dynamic nature of chromatin nucleoprotein complex, capable of rapid unfolding, disassembling, assembling and refolding, we first show that chromatin condensation at repairing or replicating DNA sites induces the mechanical stress needed for chromosome shattering to ensue. Premature chromosome condensation is then used to visualize the dynamic nature of interphase chromatin and demonstrate that such mechanical stress and chromosome shattering can also occur in chromosomes within micronuclei or asynchronous multinucleate cells when primary nuclei enter mitosis. Following an aberrant mitosis, chromosomes could find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time so that they may undergo massive DNA breakage and rearrangement in a single catastrophic event. Specifically, our results support the hypothesis that premature chromosome condensation induces mechanical stress and triggers shattering and chromothripsis in chromosomes or chromosome arms still undergoing DNA replication or repair in micronuclei or asynchronous multinucleate cells, when primary nuclei enter mitosis.",

Nanoparticles are of interest as radioprotective agents, particularly due to their high solubility and bioavailability. Silymarin is a hepatoprotective agent but has poor oral bioavailability. Silymarin was formulated as a nanoemulsion with the aim of improving its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy. In the present study, we evaluated self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) formulated with surfactants and co-surfactants. Nano-silymarin was characterized by estimating % transmittance, globule size, and polydispersity index, and by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The nano-silymarin obtained was in the range of 3\u20138\u00a0nm diameter. With regard to DNA damage, measured by a plasmid relaxation assay, maximum protection was obtained at 10\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Cytotoxicity of nano-silymarin to human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells was evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Protective efficacy against \u03b3-radiation was assessed by reduction in micronucleus frequency and ROS generation, using the 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) assay. Radiation-induced apoptosis was estimated by microscopic analysis and cell-cycle estimation. Nano-silymarin was radioprotective, supporting the possibility of developing new approaches to radiation protection via nanotechnology.",

     "abstract": "At the gastrula phase of development, just after the onset of implantation, the embryo proper is characterized by extremely rapid cell proliferation. The importance of DNA repair is illustrated by embryonic lethality at this stage after ablation of the genes involved. Insight into mutation induction is called for by the fact that women often do not realize they are pregnant, shortly after implantation, a circumstance which may have important consequences when women are subjected to medical imaging using ionizing radiation. We screened gastrula embryos for DNA synthesis, nuclear morphology, growth, and chromosome aberrations (CA) shortly after irradiation with doses up to 2.5\u00a0Gy. In order to obtain an insight into the importance of DNA repair for CA induction, we included mutants for the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways, as well as Parp1-/- and p53+/\u2212 embryos. With the pUR288 shuttle vector assay, we determined the radiation sensitivity for point mutations and small deletions detected in young adults. We found increased numbers of abnormal nuclei 5\u00a0h after irradiation; an indication of disturbed development was also observed around this time. Chromosome aberrations 7\u00a0h after irradiation arose in all genotypes and were mainly of the chromatid type, in agreement with a cell cycle dominated by S-phase. Increased frequencies of CA were found for NHEJ and HR mutants. Gastrula embryos are unusual in that they are low in exchange induction, even after compromised HR. Gastrula embryos were radiation sensitive in the pUR288 shuttle vector assay, giving the highest mutation induction ever reported for this genetic toxicology model. On theoretical grounds, a delayed radiation response must be involved. The compromised developmental profile after doses up to 2.5\u00a0Gy likely is caused by both apoptosis and later cell death due to large deletions. Our data indicate a distinct radiation-sensitive profile of gastrula embryos, including some stage-specific aspects that are not as yet understood.",

Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were exposed to a single dose of NaF (25\u00a0mg/kg/day) with or without NAC (150\u00a0mg/kg/day) for 7 weeks (7W) by gastric gavage. Testicular fluorine content was detected by fluorine ion selective electrode method. Oxidative damage to DNA was evaluated by measuring the increase in 8-OHdG formation in testicular tissue through immunohistochemical staining assays and also the effects of NAC pretreatment. The biochemical indicators about oxidative stress were detected by colorimetric assays, sperm parameters and the morphological changes of testis were studied. NaF significantly increased serum levels of oxidative stress, markedly elevated testicular fluorine and 8-OHdG expression levels as well as the rate of sperm aberration compared to saline group. Testosterone in serum, sperm counts and the mobility of sperm were lower than those of the rats in control group. The pathological morphological changes in testicular seminiferous tubule were also obvious in the rats with NaF treatment. Pretreatment with NAC did not reduce the contents of fluoride content in testis, but significantly reduced 8-OHdG formation and lipid peroxidation. This study suggests that NAC may have certain antagonism on the reproductive damage induced by NaF.",

Genotoxicity was evaluated by the comet and micronucleus assays, and cytotoxicity by the trypan blue method. Cells were treated with silica powders for 4 and 24\u00a0h.

Array based DNA methylation analysis showed that the impacts of Cr(VI) on DNA methylation were limited, only about 40 differentially methylated CpG sites, with an overlap of 15\u00a0CpG sites, were induced by both potassium dichromate and lead chromate. The results of mRNA expression showed that after Cr(VI) treatment, mRNA expression changes of four genes (TBL1Y, FZD5, IKZF2, and KIAA1949) were consistent with their DNA methylation alteration, but DNA methylation changes of other six genes did not correlate with mRNA expression. In conclusion, both of soluble and particulate Cr(VI) could induce a small amount of differentially methylated sites in human B lymphoblastoid cells, and the correlations between DNA methylation changes and mRNA expression varied between different genes.",

Validation of the THA mouse model was confirmed by exposing groups of male mice to sub-erythemal doses of ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation for three consecutive days emitted from calibrated overhead, Kodacel-filtered fluorescent lamps and measuring the mutant frequencies (MFs) in the gpt and red/gam (Spi\u2212) genes and types of mutations in the gpt gene. The doses or irradiation were monitored with broad-spectrum dosimeters that were calibrated to a NIST-traceable standard and cumulative CIE-weighted doses were 20.55 and 41.0\u00a0mJ/cm2 (effective). Mice were sacrificed 14 days after the final UVB exposure and MFs in both the gpt and red/gam genes were evaluated in the epidermis.

Then, we hypothesized that the period following chemical exposure enable the detection of MNHEP induction in young adult rats, namely that MNHEPs can be generated from chromosomally damaged cells and accumulate following initiation of chemical exposure until sampling. We therefore measured MNHEP induction at 2 or 4 weeks after a single oral administration of 12.5, 50, or 100\u00a0mg/kg of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) or an intraperitoneal administration of 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0\u00a0mg/kg of mitomycin C (MMC) to young adult rats. Results showed a statistically significant, dose-dependent increase in the numbers of MNHEPs in DEN- or MMC-treated rats, indicating that prolonged rest period following a single dose of a genotoxic chemical enables the detection of MNHEP induction in the liver of young adult rats. From these results, a single oral administration of 50\u00a0mg/kg of DEN with a 2- or 4- week rest period can be used as a positive control in repeated-dose liver micronucleus assays. This procedure is superior in terms of labor saving and animal welfare to repeated dosing of DEN.",

Therefore, it was of interest to us to investigate the effects of low dose and low dose-rate X-irradiation in patients who underwent CT imaging by recording the doses received by the eye, forehead and thyroid, and to study the levels of damages in the lymphocytes in vivo.Lithium manganese borate doped with terbium (LMB:Tb) thermo luminescence dosimeters (TLD) were used to record the doses in the patient\u2019s (n\u00a0=\u00a027) eye, forehead, and thyroid and compared with the dose length product (DLP) values.

A recent study of micronucleus (MN) induction [2] showed that commonly used p53-deficient rodent cell lines (CHL, CHO and V79) gave a higher frequency of \u201cmisleading\u201d positive results with 9 non-DNA reactive, Ames-negative and in vivo negative chemicals [3] than human p53-competent cells (blood lymphocytes, TK6 and HepG2 cell lines). This raised the question of whether these differences were due to p53 status or species origin.This present study compared human versus mouse and p53-competent versus p53-mutated function. The same 9 chemicals were tested for induction of MN in mouse lymphoma L5178Y (mutated p53), human TK6 (functional p53) and WIL2-NS (TK6 related, with mutated p53) cells. Six chemicals provided clear positive increases in MN frequency in at least one cell type. L5178Y cells yielded clear positive responses with more chemicals than either TK6 or WIL2-NS, indicating origin rather than p53 functionality was most relevant. Apoptosis induction (measured via caspase-3/7) was also investigated with clear differences in the timing and extent of apoptosis induction between mouse and human cells noted. With curcumin in TK6 cells, induction of caspase-3/7 activity coincided with MN induction, whereas for L5178Y cells, MN induction occurred in the absence of increased caspase activity. By contrast, with MMS in TK6 cells, MN induction preceded increased caspase-3/7 activity. These data suggest that MN induction by \u201cmisleading positive\u201d genotoxins in p53-competent human cell lines may result from apoptosis, whereas in p53-defective rodent cells such as L5178Y, MN induction may be independent of apoptosis.",

By performing expression microarrays and RNA-Seq analysis on wild-type and mutant TP53 human lymphocytes respectively derived from controls and Li-Fraumeni patients and exposed to different classes of genotoxic agents, we first determined a common p53-dependent transcriptional signature of DNA damage. We then derived a simple and fast assay based on the exposure of wild-type TP53 lymphocytes to physical or chemical agents and on the quantitative measurement of selected p53 target gene transcriptional induction. The specificity of the p53 genotoxicity assay can easily be demonstrated by performing the same experiment in control lymphocytes with heterozygous TP53 mutations, which compromise responses to DNA damage. This assay allowed us to show that most of the drugs commonly used in cancer treatment, except the microtubule poisons, are highly genotoxic. The p53 genotoxicity assay should facilitate the measurement of the genotoxic effects of chemical and physical agents and the identification of drugs that are not genotoxic and do not expose patients to the risk of secondary malignancies, especially those with a constitutional defect in response to DNA damage, such as patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.",

     "abstract": "Chronic inhalation of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) increases the incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar tumors in male and female B6C3F1 mice at 1, 2, or 4\u00a0mg/m3. The genotoxicity of V2O5 has been extensively investigated in the literature with mixed results. In general, tests for gene mutations have been negative. Both positive and negative results were reported for clastogenicity in vitro with some reports suggesting aneugenic potential. In vivo, V2O5 was negative in the mouse micronucleus test (erythrocyte) and comet assay (lung). Previously, K-ras mutations have been detected in the lung tumors in mice exposed to V2O5. Recently, a short-term inhalation study in B6C3F1 mice reported slight induction of 8-oxodGuo DNA lesions in lungs. Because 8-oxodGuo DNA lesions can lead to gene mutations if not repaired or if misrepaired, we have used groups of transgenic Big Blue (BB) mice (B6C3F1) to test whether V2O5 has mutagenic potential in vivo in the tumor target tissue under the conditions of the bioassay. Groups of six male BB mice were exposed to particulate aerosols containing 0, 0.1, or 1\u00a0mg/m3 (tumorigenic concentration) V2O5 for 4 or 8 weeks (6\u00a0h/day, 5 days/week) and cII mutant frequencies (MFs) were evaluated in the right lungs. A significant increase in lung weight was noted in mice exposed to 1\u00a0mg/m3 V2O5 (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) compared to sham control, confirming exposure to an inflammatory level of the test material. The mean MFs (\u00d710\u22126) of mice in the 4-week exposure groups were 30 (sham control), 39 (0.1\u00a0mg/m3), and 24 (1\u00a0mg/m3) while the corresponding values in the 8-week exposure groups were 29, 48, and 17, respectively. None of these cII MFs measured at any time point was significantly higher than the corresponding control MFs (P\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.1). Overall, these results suggest that mutagenicity is not likely to be an initial key event in the lung tumorigenicity of V2O5.",

     "abstract": "This study investigated whether Kras mutation is an early event in the development of lung tumors induced by inhalation of particulate vanadium pentoxide (VP) aerosols. A National Toxicology Program tumor bioassay of inhaled particulate VP aerosols established that VP-induced alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas of the B6C3F1 mouse lung carried Kras mutations at a higher frequency than observed in spontaneous mouse lung tumors. Therefore, this study sought to: (1) characterize any Kras mutational response with respect to VP exposure concentration, and (2) investigate the possibility that amplification of preexisting Kras mutation is an early event in VP-induced mouse lung tumorigenesis. Male Big Blue B6C3F1 mice (6 mice/group) were exposed to aerosolized particulate VP by inhalation, 6\u00a0h/day, 5 days/week for 4 or 8 weeks, using VP exposure concentrations of 0, 0.1, and 1\u00a0mg/m3.

For both exposure concentrations (0.1 and 1.0\u00a0mg/m3) and both time points (4 and 8 weeks), the mutant fractions observed in VP-exposed mice were not significantly different from the concurrent controls. Given that 8 weeks of inhalation of a tumorigenic concentration of particulate aerosols of VP did not result in a significant change in levels of lung Kras mutation, the data do not support either a direct genotoxic effect of VP on Kras or early amplification of preexisting mutation as being involved in the genesis of VP-induced mouse lung tumors under the exposure conditions used. Rather, the data suggest that accumulation of Kras mutation occurs later with chronic VP exposure and is likely not an early event in VP-induced mouse lung carcinogenesis.",

To assess whether these tumors could be the result of a direct mutagenic or genotoxic mode of action, we conducted a GLP-compliant 7-day drinking water study to assess crypt health along the entire length of the duodenum. Mice were exposed to water (vehicle control), 1.4, 21, or 180\u00a0ppm Cr(VI) via drinking water for 7 consecutive days. Crypt enterocytes in Swiss roll sections were scored as normal, mitotic, apoptotic, karyorrhectic, or as having micronuclei. A single oral gavage of 50\u00a0mg/kg cyclophosphamide served as a positive control for micronucleus induction. Exposure to 21 and 180\u00a0ppm Cr(VI) significantly increased the number of crypt enterocytes. Micronuclei and \u03b3-H2AX immunostaining were not elevated in the crypts of Cr(VI)-treated mice. In contrast, treatment with cyclophosphamide significantly increased numbers of crypt micronuclei and qualitatively increased \u03b3-H2AX immunostaining. Synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy revealed the presence of strong Cr fluorescence in duodenal villi, but negligible Cr fluorescence in the crypt compartment. Together, these data indicate that Cr(VI) does not adversely effect the crypt compartment where intestinal stem cells reside, and provide additional evidence that the mode of action for Cr(VI)-induced intestinal cancer in B6C3F1 mice involves chronic villous wounding resulting in compensatory crypt enterocyte hyperplasia.",

Based on existing carcinogenicity and genotoxicity data and chemical class information, 90 chemicals were identified as primary candidates for use in the validation study. From these 90 chemicals, 46 secondary candidates and then 40 final chemicals were selected based on a sufficiency of carcinogenic and genotoxic data, differences in chemical class or genotoxic or carcinogenic mode of action (MOA), availability, price, and ease of handling.

Acute toxic effects of treatment were determined primarily through histomorphologic analysis of liver and stomach but also by body weight and serum liver enzyme changes. The comet assay was conducted on fresh tissue preparations but frozen samples from two studies were also assayed. Statistically significant dose-related differences in comet % DNA in tail were found in liver and stomach for the genotoxin AZT and in liver for the genotoxin CPN, but not in liver or stomach for the non-genotoxin IBA. Statistically significant differences in % DNA in tail were measured in liver for the low and mid dose of the genotoxin AAF, but not the high dose. The comet assays of frozen liver suspensions from CPN- and AAF-treated rats yielded comparable results to the assays of fresh preparations. There were no indications of significant toxicity induced by any treatment. The micronucleus assay was positive for CPN and AZT and negative for IBA. In conclusion, the in vivo comet assay is capable of detecting genotoxic effects of a variety of chemicals and may fill an important role in the genotoxicity test battery.",

MNU significantly increased the % tail DNA in all the organs. Histopathological analysis showed no cytotoxic effect on the liver, indicating clearly that MNU has a genotoxic potential in the liver. In the stomach, however, the cytotoxic effects were very severe at systemically non-toxic doses. Low-dose MNU significantly increased the % tail DNA even at a non-cytotoxic dose, indicating that MNU has a genotoxic potential also in the stomach. Part of the DNA damage at cytotoxic doses was considered to be a secondary effect of severe cell damage. In the bone marrow, both the % tail DNA and incidence of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes significantly increased at non-hematotoxic doses, which were different from the non-cytotoxic doses for liver and stomach. These findings indicate that an optimal dose for detecting DNA damage may vary among organs and that careful attention is required to select an optimum dose for the comet assay based on systemic toxicity such as mortality and clinical observations. The present study shows that when serious cytotoxicity is suggested by increased % hedgehogs in the comet assay, histopathological examination should be included for the evaluation of a positive response.",

Each of the three test chemicals was administered to 5 male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats per group by oral gavage at 48, 24, and 3\u00a0h before specimen preparation. Single cells were collected from the liver and glandular stomach at 3\u00a0h after the final dosing, and the specimens prepared from these two organs were subjected to electrophoresis under alkaline conditions (pH\u00a0>\u00a013). The percentage of DNA intensity in the comet tail was then assessed using an image analysis system. A micronucleus (MN) assay was also conducted using these three test chemicals with the bone marrow (BM) cells collected from the same animals simultaneously used in the comet assay, i.e., combination study of the comet assay and BM MN assay. A genotoxic (Ames positive) rodent carcinogen, DBE gave a positive result in the comet assay in the present study, while a genotoxic (Ames positive) non-carcinogen, ASD and a non-genotoxic (Ames negative) non-carcinogen, ANT showed negative results in the comet assay. All three chemicals produced negative results in the BM MN assay. While the comet assay findings in the present study were consistent with those obtained from the rodent carcinogenicity studies for the three test chemicals, we consider the positive result in the comet assay for DBE to be particularly meaningful, given that this chemical produced a negative result in the BM MN assay. Therefore, the combination study of the comet assay and BM MN assay is a useful method to detect genotoxic carcinogens that are undetectable with the BM MN assay alone.",

Animal dosing schedules, the comet assay processing and analysis, and statistical analysis were conducted in accordance with the standard protocol. Based upon our blinded evaluation, AMP was not found to exhibit evidence of genotoxicity in either the rat liver or stomach. However, both NDA and DMH were observed to cause a significant increase in % tail DNA in the rat liver at all dose levels tested.

There was no evidence of genotoxicity from either NDA or DMH in the rat stomach. In conclusion, our laboratory observed increased DNA damage from two blinded test compounds in rat liver (later identified as genotoxic carcinogens), while no evidence of genotoxicity was observed for the third blinded test compound (later identified as a non-genotoxic, non-carcinogen).

DNA damage was evaluated in the liver and stomach of 7- to 9-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats. Of the five genotoxic carcinogens tested in our laboratory, DMN and 1,2-DMH were positive in the liver and negative in the stomach, 2-AAF and o-anisidine produced an equivocal result in liver and negative results in stomach, and sodium arsenite was negative in both liver and stomach. 1,2-DMH and DMN induced dose-related increases in hedgehogs in the same tissue (liver) that exhibited increased DNA migration. However, no cytotoxicity was indicated by the neutral diffusion assay (assessment of highly fragmented DNA) or histopathology in response to treatment with any of the tested chemicals. Therefore, the increased DNA damage resulting from exposure to DMN and 1,2-DMH was considered to represent a genotoxic response. Sodium chloride, a non-genotoxic non-carcinogen, was negative in both tissues as would be predicted. Although only two (1,2-DMH and DMN) out of five genotoxic carcinogens produced clearly positive results in the comet assay, the results obtained for o-anisidine and sodium arsenite in liver and stomach cells are consistent with the known mode of genotoxicity and tissue specificity exhibited by these carcinogens. In contrast, given the known genotoxic mode-of-action and target organ carcinogenicity of 2-AAF, it is unclear why this chemical failed to convincingly increase DNA migration in the liver. Thus, the results of the comet assay validation studies conducted in our laboratory were considered appropriate for five out of the six test chemicals.",

Melatonin (Mel), when incorporated into lipid-core nanocapsules (Mel-LNC), has enhanced antioxidant properties. The effects of such a formulation have not yet been studied with respect to mitigation of PQ- induced cytotoxicity and DNA damage. Here, we have tested whether Mel-LNC can ameliorate PQ-induced toxicity in the A549 alveolar epithelial cell line. Physicochemical characterization of the formulations was performed. Cellular uptake was measured using nanocapsules marked with rhodamine B. Cell viability was determined by the MTT assay and DNA damage was assessed by the comet assay. The enzyme-modified comet assay with endonuclease III (Endo III) and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG) were used to investigate oxidative DNA damage. Incubation with culture medium for 24\u00a0h did not alter the granulometric profile of Mel-LNC formulations. Following treatment (3 and 24\u00a0h), red fluorescence was detected around the cell nucleus, indicating internalization of the formulation. Melatonin solution (Mel), Mel-LNC, and LNC did not have significant effects on cell viability or DNA damage. Pre-treatment with Mel-LNC enhanced cell viability and showed a remarkable reduction in % DNA in tail compared to the PQ group; this was not observed in cells pre-treated with Mel. PQ induces oxidative DNA damage detected with the enzyme-modified comet assay. Mel-LNC reduced this damage more effectively than did Mel. In summary, Mel-LNC is better than Mel at protecting A549 cells from the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of PQ.",

Semi-synthetic water-soluble isoquercetin and rutin glycosides, maltooligosyl isoquercetin, monoglucosyl rutin and maltooligosyl rutin were developed by synthetic glycosylation to overcome solubility challenges for improved incorporation in food and medicinal applications. Quercetin and its natural glycosides are known to induce genetic instability and decrease cell proliferation. Using a system of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, this study examined the differences in cytotoxic and genotoxic responses induced by natural and synthetic flavonoids. Bioactivity evaluations using poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) ELISA showed that the synthetic flavonoids were less effective in inhibiting PARP than the natural flavonoids, where PARP inhibitory effects decreased with glycosylation of flavonoids. In the genotoxic studies, treatments with flavonoids at a concentration range of 0.2\u00a0\u03bcM\u20131\u00a0mM induced significant frequencies of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronuclei in CHO cells compared to spontaneous occurrences. The synthetic flavonoids monoglucosyl rutin and maltooligosyl rutin induced less genotoxic effects than the natural flavonoids. However, maltooligosyl isoquercetin induced similar responses as isoquercetin and rutin. The growth inhibition studies showed glycosylation dependent cytotoxicity in natural flavonoids. The quercetin aglycone exhibited the highest toxicity out of all the flavonoids studied. Differences in growth inhibition were not observed between the synthetic flavonoids, maltooligosyl isoquercetin and monoglucosyl rutin, and natural isoquercetin and rutin, respectively.

     "abstract": "The lacZ reversion assay in Escherichia coli measures point mutations that occur by specific base substitutions and frameshift mutations. The tester strains cannot use lactose as a carbon source (Lac\u2212), and revertants are easily detected by growth on lactose medium (Lac+). Six strains identify the six possible base substitutions, and five strains measure +G, \u2212G, \u2212CG, +A and \u2212A frameshifts. Strong mutagens give dose-dependent increases in numbers of revertants per plate and revertant frequencies. Testing compounds that are arguably nonmutagens or weakly mutagenic, we often noted statistically significant dose-dependent increases in revertant frequency that were not accompanied by an absolute increase in numbers of revertants. The increase in frequency was wholly ascribable to a declining number of viable cells owing to toxicity. Analysis of the conditions revealed that the frequency of spontaneous revertants is higher when there are fewer viable cells per plate. The phenomenon resembles \u201cadaptive\u201d or \u201cstress\u201d mutagenesis, whereby lactose revertants accumulate in Lac\u2212 bacteria under starvation conditions in the absence of catabolite repression. Adaptive mutation is observed after long incubation and might be expected to be irrelevant in a standard assay using 48-h incubation. However, we found that elevated revertant frequencies occur under typical assay conditions when the bacterial lawn is thin, and this can cause increases in revertant frequency that mimic chemical mutagenesis when treatments are toxic but not mutagenic. Responses that resemble chemical mutagenesis were observed in the absence of mutagenic treatment in strains that revert by different frameshift mutations. The magnitude of the artifact is affected by cell density, dilution, culture age, incubation time, catabolite repression and the age and composition of media. Although the specific reversion assay is effective for quickly distinguishing classes of mutations induced by potent mutagens, its utility for discerning effects of weak mutagens may be compromised by the artifact.",

Thymol and carvacrol, the major EO compounds of O. vulgare, have demonstrated their potential use as active additives.

The aim of this work was to investigate the potential in vitro genotoxicity of thymol (0\u2013250\u00a0\u03bcM) and carvacrol (0\u20132500\u00a0\u03bcM) at equivalent doses to those used in food packaging. The micronucleus (MN) test and the mouse lymphoma (MLA) assay on L5178Y/Tk\u00b1 mouse lymphoma cells were used. The negative results for thymol with the MN with and without the S9 fraction and also with the MLA assay reinforce the view that this compound is not genotoxic in mammalian cells. However, carvacrol presented slight genotoxic effects, but only in the MN test at the highest concentration assayed (700\u00a0\u03bcM) and in the absence of metabolic activation. The lack of genotoxic response in the MLA assay after 4 and 24\u00a0h of exposure indicates a low genotoxic potential for carvacrol. Alternatively, the general negative findings observed in both assays suggest that the MN results of carvacrol are marginal data without biological relevance. These results can be useful to identify the appropriate concentrations of these substances to be used as additives in food packaging.",

The areas covered were: identification of the domain of applicability and regulatory acceptance, identification of critical parameters of the protocol and attempts to standardize the assay, experience with combination and integration with other in vivo studies, demonstration of laboratory proficiency, sensitivity and power of the protocol used, use of different tissues, freezing of samples, and choice of appropriate measures of cytotoxicity. The standard protocol detects various types of DNA lesions but it does not detect all types of DNA damage. Modifications of the standard protocol may be used to detect additional types of specific DNA damage (e.g., cross-links, bulky adducts, oxidized bases). In addition, the working group identified critical parameters that should be carefully controlled and described in detail in every published study protocol.In vivo comet assay results are more reliable if they were obtained in laboratories that have demonstrated proficiency. This includes demonstration of adequate response to vehicle controls and an adequate response to a positive control for each tissue being examined. There was a general agreement that freezing of samples is an option but more data are needed in order to establish generally accepted protocols. With regard to tissue toxicity, the working group concluded that cytotoxicity could be a confounder of comet results. It is recommended to look at multiple parameters such as histopathological observations, organ-specific clinical chemistry as well as indicators of tissue inflammation to decide whether compound-specific toxicity might influence the result. The expert working group concluded that the alkaline in vivo comet assay is a mature test for the evaluation of genotoxicity and can be recommended to regulatory agencies for use.",

     "abstract": "At the 6th International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing (IWGT), the liver micronucleus test working group discussed practical aspects of the in vivo rodent liver micronucleus test (LMNT). The group members focused on the three methodologies currently used, i.e., a partial hepatectomy (PH) method, a juvenile/young rat (JR) method, and a repeated-dose (RD) method in adult rodents. Since the liver is the main organ that metabolizes chemicals, the LMNT is expected to detect clastogens, especially those that need metabolic activation in the liver, and aneugens. Based on current data the three methods seem to have a high sensitivity and specificity, but more data, especially on non-genotoxic but toxic substances, would be needed to fully evaluate the test performance. The three methods can be combined with the micronucleus test (MNT) using bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB). The ability of the PH method to detect both clastogens and aneugens has already been established, but the methodology is technically challenging. The JR method is relatively straightforward, but animal metabolism might not be fully comparable to adult animals, and data on aneugens are limited. These two methods also have the advantage of a short testing period. The RD method is also straightforward and can be integrated into repeated-dose (e.g. 2 or 4 weeks) toxicity studies, but again data on aneugens are limited. The working group concluded that the LMNT could be used as a second in vivo test when a relevant positive result in in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests is noted (especially under the condition of metabolic activation), and a negative result is observed in the in vivo BM/PB-MNT. The group members discussed LMNT protocols and reached consensus about many aspects of test procedures. However, data gaps as mentioned above remain, and further data are needed to fully establish the LMNT protocol.",

     "abstract": "At the 6th International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing, the liver micronucleus test (MNT) working group briefly discussed the MNT using tissues other than liver/erythrocytes. Many tissues other than liver/erythrocytes have been studied, primarily for research purposes. They have included the colon and intestinal epithelium, skin, spleen, lung, stomach, bladder, buccal mucosa, vagina, and fetal/neonatal tissues. These tissues were chosen because they were target sites of carcinogens, and/or relevant to a specific route of exposure. Recently, there has been particular focus on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract as it is a contact site associated with high exposure following oral gavage. Furthermore GI tumors are observed with high frequency in human populations. A collaborative study of the rat glandular stomach and colon MNT was conducted in conjunction with a collaborative study of the repeated-dose liver MNT. Based on limited data currently available, the rodent MNT using the glandular stomach and/or colon seems to detect genotoxic carcinogens with GI tract target-organ specificity. The working group concluded that the GI tract MNT would be a promising method to examine clastogenicity or aneugenicity of test chemicals in the stomach and/or colon. Further data will be needed to fully establish the methods, and to identify the sensitivity and specificity of the GI tract MNT.",

There is good evidence suggesting that the absence of antibody binding is the result of a mutation in the endogenous X-linked Pig-a gene, which forms the rationale for the assay. Although the assay has been performed with several types of hematopoietic cells and in a variety of mammalian species, including humans, currently it is optimized only for measuring CD59-deficient (presumed Pig-a mutant) erythrocytes in the peripheral blood of rats. An expert workgroup formed by the International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing considered the state of assay development and the potential of the assay for regulatory use. Consensus was reached on what is known about the Pig-a assay and how it should be conducted, and recommendations were made on additional data and refinements that would help to further enhance the assay for use in hazard identification and risk assessment.",

     "abstract": "This workshop reviewed the current science to inform and recommend the best evidence-based approaches on the use of germ cell genotoxicity tests. The workshop questions and key outcomes were as follows. (1) Do genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays in somatic cells predict germ cell effects? Limited data suggest that somatic cell tests detect most germ cell mutagens, but there are strong concerns that dictate caution in drawing conclusions. (2) Should germ cell tests be done, and when? If there is evidence that a chemical or its metabolite(s) will not reach target germ cells or gonadal tissue, it is not necessary to conduct germ cell tests, notwithstanding somatic outcomes. However, it was recommended that negative somatic cell mutagens with clear evidence for gonadal exposure and evidence of toxicity in germ cells could be considered for germ cell mutagenicity testing. For somatic mutagens that are known to reach the gonadal compartments and expose germ cells, the chemical could be assumed to be a germ cell mutagen without further testing. Nevertheless, germ cell mutagenicity testing would be needed for quantitative risk assessment. (3) What new assays should be implemented and how? There is an immediate need for research on the application of whole genome sequencing in heritable mutation analysis in humans and animals, and integration of germ cell assays with somatic cell genotoxicity tests. Focus should be on environmental exposures that can cause de novo mutations, particularly newly recognized types of genomic changes. Mutational events, which may occur by exposure of germ cells during embryonic development, should also be investigated. Finally, where there are indications of germ cell toxicity in repeat dose or reproductive toxicology tests, consideration should be given to leveraging those studies to inform of possible germ cell genotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "This report summarizes the discussion, conclusions, and points of consensus of the IWGT Working Group on Quantitative Approaches to Genetic Toxicology Risk Assessment (QWG) based on a meeting in Foz do Igua\u00e7u, Brazil October 31\u2013November 2, 2013. Topics addressed included (1) the need for quantitative dose\u2013response analysis, (2) methods to analyze exposure\u2013response relationships & derive point of departure (PoD) metrics, (3) points of departure (PoD) and mechanistic threshold considerations, (4) approaches to define exposure-related risks, (5) empirical relationships between genetic damage (mutation) and cancer, and (6) extrapolations across test systems and species. This report discusses the first three of these topics and a companion report discusses the latter three. The working group critically examined methods for determining point of departure metrics (PoDs) that could be used to estimate low-dose risk of genetic damage and from which extrapolation to acceptable exposure levels could be made using appropriate mode of action information and uncertainty factors. These included benchmark doses (BMDs) derived from fitting families of exponential models, the N o O bserved G enotoxic E ffect L evel (NOGEL), and \u201cthreshold\u201d or breakpoint dose (BPD) levels derived from bilinear models when mechanistic data supported this approach. The QWG recognizes that scientific evidence suggests that thresholds below which genotoxic effects do not occur likely exist for both DNA-reactive and DNA-nonreactive substances, but notes that small increments of the spontaneous level cannot be unequivocally excluded either by experimental measurement or by mathematical modeling. Therefore, rather than debating the theoretical possibility of such low-dose effects, emphasis should be placed on determination of PoDs from which acceptable exposure levels can be determined by extrapolation using available mechanistic information and appropriate uncertainty factors. This approach places the focus on minimization of the genotoxic risk, which protects against the risk of the development of diseases resulting from the genetic damage. Based on analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each method, the QWG concluded that the order of preference of PoD metrics is the statistical lower bound on the BMD\u00a0>\u00a0the NOGEL\u00a0>\u00a0a statistical lower bound on the BPD. A companion report discusses the use of these metrics in genotoxicity risk assessment, including scaling and uncertainty factors to be considered when extrapolating below the PoD and/or across test systems and to the human.",

This report summarizes the QWG discussions and recommendations regarding appropriate approaches to evaluate exposure-related risks of genotoxic damage, including extrapolation below identified PoDs and across test systems and species. Recommendations include the selection of appropriate genetic endpoints and target tissues, uncertainty factors and extrapolation methods to be considered, the importance and use of information on mode of action, toxicokinetics, metabolism, and exposure biomarkers when using quantitative exposure-response data to determine acceptable exposure levels in human populations or to assess the risk associated with known or anticipated exposures. The empirical relationship between genetic damage (mutation and chromosomal aberration) and cancer in animal models was also examined. It was concluded that there is a general correlation between cancer induction and mutagenic and/or clastogenic damage for agents thought to act via a genotoxic mechanism, but that the correlation is limited due to an inadequate number of cases in which mutation and cancer can be compared at a sufficient number of doses in the same target tissues of the same species and strain exposed under directly comparable routes and experimental protocols.",

MP-124 increased structural chromosomal aberration in CHL/IU cells, but showed negative results in the bacterial reverse mutation test, and the rat bone marrow micronucleus (MN) and the rat liver unscheduled DNA synthesis tests after the intravenous bolus injection. Thus, MP-124 did not appear to be direct-acting mutagen. Since, PARP-1 is a key enzyme in DNA repair, the effect of continuous PARP-1 inhibition by MP-124 was further examined in the rat MN test under 24-h intravenous infusion, and an increase in micronucleated immature erythrocytes (MNIE) was observed. The increase was clearly reduced by co-treatment with nicotinic acid, which resulted in increased intracellular NAD levels. This is consistent with the established activity of MP-124 as a competitive inhibitor of PARP and provides strong evidence that the DNA-damaging effect that leads to the increase in MNIE is a secondary effect of PARP-1 inhibition. This mechanism is expected to result in a threshold for the induction of MNIE by MP-124, and allows for the establishment of a safe margin of exposure for the therapeutic use of MP-124.",

Little information exists on TA97, TA104, TA1535, TA1537 and TA102 using an aerosol 35\u00a0mm spread-plate format. In this study, TA1535 and TA1537 were considered sub-optimal for use with a scaled-down format, due to low spontaneous revertant numbers (0\u20135 revertants/plate). In the context of a regulatory environment, TA97 is deemed an acceptable alternative for TA1537 and was therefore selected for whole smoke exposure in this study. However, there is no acceptable alternative for TA1535, therefore this strain was included for whole smoke exposure. TA1535, TA97, TA102 and TA104 were assessed for mutagenic responses following exposure to cigarette smoke at varying concentrations (using diluting airflow rates of 1.0, 4.0, 8.0 and 12.0\u00a0L/min), and exposure times of 24 and 64\u00a0min. A positive mutagenic response to cigarette smoke was observed in strain TA104 at both the 24 and 64\u00a0min time points, in the presence of S-9, at the highest smoke concentration tested (1.0\u00a0L/min diluting airflow). The three remaining strains were found to be unresponsive to cigarette smoke at all concentrations tested, in the presence and absence of metabolic activation. Cigarette smoke particulate deposition was quantified in situ of exposure using quartz crystal microbalance technology, enabling data to be presented against an associated gravimetric mass (\u03bcg/cm2). Finally, data obtained in this study were combined with previously published Ames data for TA98, TA100, YG1024, YG1042 and Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA pKM101), generated using the same 35\u00a0mm methodology. The combined data-set was used to propose an aerosol testing strategy, based on strain compatibility with the whole smoke aerosol, whilst maintaining the essence of the regulatory guidelines for the standard Ames assay.",

We have already reported that structural or numerical chromosome aberration inducers have to be given before or after partial hepatectomy, respectively, to detect their genotoxicity in the liver of rats. In the present study, we assessed a twice dosing regimen, in which the genotoxicant is dosed both before and after partial hepatectomy, using the four chromosome aberration inducers used in the previous study. Two structural chromosome aberration inducers (diethylnitrosamine and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine) and two numerical chromosome aberration inducers (colchicine and carbendazim) were used. The genotoxicant was administered to 8-week old male F344 rats one day before and again one day after the partial hepatectomy and hepatocytes were isolated 3 days after second dosing (4 days after the partial hepatectomy). As a result, all genotoxicants (structural or numerical chromosome aberration inducers) caused a dose-dependent statistically significant increase in the incidence of micronucleated hepatocytes when given both before and after partial hepatectomy. No marked difference was observed in general toxicity, relative liver weight and cell classification between single dosing regimens and twice dosing regimen of the genotoxicants. These results confirm that the twice dosing regimen, in which the test compound is dosed both before and after partial hepatectomy, can detect in vivo induction of micronucleated hepatocytes by structural or numerical chromosome aberration inducers qualitatively similar to their appropriate regimen in which the test compound is administered either before or after partial hepatectomy.",

     "abstract": "Validation of the Pig-a gene mutation assay has been based mainly on studies in male rodents. To determine if the mutagen-induced responses of the X-linked Pig-a gene differ in females compared to males, groups of five male and female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to the mutagens 1,3-propane sultone (80\u00a0mg/kg/day), ethyl carbamate (600\u00a0mg/kg/day), or thiotepa (7.5\u00a0mg/kg/day) for three consecutive days (study days 1\u20133). Pig-a mutant phenotype reticulocyte (RETCD59\u2212) and mutant phenotype erythrocyte (RBCCD59\u2212) frequencies were determined on study days \u22124, 15, 30 and 46 using immunomagnetic separation in conjunction with flow cytometric analysis (In Vivo MutaFlow\u00ae). While the percentage of reticulocytes (%RET) was markedly higher for pre-treatment blood samples from males compared to females (6.6% vs. 3.5%), this sex effect was slight or nonexistent at later time points. Treatment-related effects to %RET were generally modest owing to the 12-day interval between last exposure and blood sampling. Mean RETCD59\u2212 and RBCCD59\u2212 frequencies were consistently low in vehicle control animals of both sexes, with 77% of samples exhibiting mutant cell frequencies \u22641\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 over study days 15\u201346. Treatment with each mutagen caused significant increases to mean RETCD59\u2212 and RBCCD59\u2212 frequencies. Whereas genotoxicant-induced RETCD59\u2212 values were maximal on day 15, induced RBCCD59\u2212 frequencies were highest at the last sampling time. Sex did not affect 1,3-propane sultone- or thiotepa-induced mutant cell frequencies. While ethyl carbamate-exposed females exhibited higher mean mutant cell frequencies compared to like-treated males, statistical significance was achieved only for RBCCD59\u2212 at one time point (7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 compared to 4.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 on day 30). Thus, while some quantitative differences were evident, there were no qualitative differences in how males and females responded to three diverse mutagens. These data support the use of both sexes for Pig-a gene mutation studies.",

     "abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is caused by a mutation in the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) gene; the condition is associated with hyper-radiosensitivity, abnormal cell-cycle checkpoints, and genomic instability. AT patients also show cerebellar ataxia, possibly due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitivity in neural cells. The ATM protein is a key regulator of the DNA damage response. Recently, several AT-like disorders have been reported. The genes responsible for them are predicted to encode proteins that interact with ATM in the DNA-damage response. Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia types 1\u20133 (AOA1, 2, and 3) result in a neurodegenerative and cellular phenotype similar to AT; however, the basis of this phenotypic similarity is unclear. Here, we show that the cells of AOA3 patients display aberrant ATM-dependent phosphorylation and apoptosis following \u03b3-irradiation. The ATM-dependent response to H2O2 treatment was abrogated in AOA3 cells. Furthermore, AOA3 cells had reduced ATM activity. Our results suggest that the attenuated ATM-related response is caused by an increase in endogenous ROS in AOA3 cells. Pretreatment of cells with pyocyanin, which induces endogenous ROS production, abolished the ATM-dependent response. Moreover, AOA3 cells had decreased homologous recombination (HR) activity, and pyocyanin pretreatment reduced HR activity in HeLa cells. These results indicate that excess endogenous ROS represses the ATM-dependent cellular response and HR repair in AOA3 cells. Since the ATM-dependent cell-cycle checkpoint is an important block to carcinogenesis, such inactivation of ATM may lead to tumorigenesis as well as neurodegeneration.",

     "abstract": "The polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), dibenzo[def,p]chrysene (DBC; also known as dibenzo[a,l]pyrene), is a potent carcinogen in animal models and a class 2A human carcinogen. Recent investigations into DBC-mediated toxicity identified DBC as a potent immunosuppressive agent similar to the well-studied immunotoxicant 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). DBC, like DMBA, is bioactivated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1B1 and forms the reactive metabolite DBC-11,12-diol-13,14-epoxide (DBCDE). DBCDE is largely responsible for the genotoxicity associated with DBC exposure. The immunosuppressive properties of several PAHs are also linked to genotoxic mechanisms. Therefore, this study was designed to identify DBCDE-DNA adduct formation in the spleen and thymus of wild-type and cytochrome P450 1b1 (Cyp1b1) knockout (KO) mice using a highly sensitive stable-isotope dilution UHPLC-MS/MS method. Stable-isotope dilution UHPLC-MS/MS identified the major DBC adducts (\u00b1)-anti-cis-DBCDE-dA and (\u00b1)-anti-trans-DBCDE-dA in the lung, liver, and spleen of both WT and Cyp1b1 KO mice. However, adduct formation in the thymus was below the level of quantitation for our method. Additionally, adduct formation in Cyp1b1 KO mice was significantly reduced compared to wild-type (WT) mice receiving DBC via oral gavage. In conclusion, the current study identifies for the first time DBCDE-dA adducts in the spleen of mice supporting the link between genotoxicity and immunosuppression, in addition to supporting previous studies identifying Cyp1b1 as the primary CYP involved in DBC bioactivation to DBCDE. The high levels of DBC-DNA adducts identified in the spleen, along with the known high levels of Cyp1b1 expression in this organ, supports further investigation into DBC-mediated immunotoxicity.",

As a result, 14 out of the 16 hepatocarcinogens were positive, including 9 genotoxic hepatocarcinogens, which were reported negative in the bone marrow/peripheral blood micronucleus (MN) assay by a single treatment. These outcomes show the high sensitivity of the RDLMN assay to hepatocarcinogens. Regarding the specificity, 4 out of the 6 non-liver targeted genotoxic carcinogens gave negative responses. This shows the high organ specificity of the RDLMN assay.In addition to the RDLMN assay, we simultaneously conducted gastrointestinal tract MN assays using 6 of the above carcinogens as an optional trial of the collaborative study. The MN assay using the glandular stomach, which is the first contact site of the test chemical when administered by oral gavage, was able to detect chromosomal aberrations with 3 test chemicals including a stomach-targeted carcinogen.The treatment regime was the 14- and/or 28-day repeated-dose, and the regime is sufficiently promising to incorporate these methods into repeated-dose toxicological studies. The outcomes of our collaborative study indicated that the new techniques to detect chromosomal aberrations in vivo in several tissues worked successfully.",

Two genotoxic hepatocarcinogens, dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) and 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), were administered orally to male rats (6 weeks old at the initial dosing) once daily for 14 and 28 days to evaluate the micronucleus (MN) inducibility in the liver. In addition, these chemicals were evaluated for MN inducibility in the bone marrow (BM) and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, i.e. glandular stomach and colon of the same animals used in the RDLMN assay. As a result, both chemicals produced positive results in the liver, although a weak positive response was given by 2-AAF. DMN gave negative results in the tissues other than the liver. 2-AAF produced positive responses in the BM and glandular stomach, and a prominent response was particularly observed in the glandular stomach, which is directly exposed to the test chemicals by gavage. The present results suggest that the RDLMN assay is a useful method for detecting genotoxic hepatocarcinogens, and that it is especially effective for evaluating test chemicals, such as DMN, undetectable by the BM and GI tract MN assay. Moreover, the results in this investigation indicate that the use of multiple tissues in the study integrating the MN tests is more effective than using a single tissue, for detection of the MN induction produced by chemical exposure to rats, and helps to determine the characteristics of the test chemicals.",

The detection of Phospho-Histone H3 was performed by immunohistochemistry to evaluate the proliferation rate of hepatocytes. The results showed significant increase in the number of micronucleated hepatocytes and Phospho-Histone H3-positive cells from the lowest dose in both 14- and 28-day RDLMN assays. On the other hand, the bone marrow MN assay yielded a negative result, which was in accordance with the existing report of the bone marrow MN assay using mice. Upon histopathological examination, inflammatory lesions and hypertrophy were noted, which may explain the increase in the hepatocyte proliferation and the enhancement of MN induction by NPYR.

MDA dose-dependently induced micronuclei in hepatocytes in 14- and 28-day repeated-dose tests. However, although statistically significant increases in micronuclei were observed in bone marrow cells at two dose levels in the 14-day study, there was no dose response and no increases in micronuclei in the 28-day study. These results indicate that the evaluation of genotoxic effects using hepatocytes is effective in cases where chromosomal aberrations are not clearly detectable in bone marrow cells. Moreover, the repeated-dose liver MN test allows evaluation at a dose below the maximum tolerable dose, which is required for the conventional MN test because micronucleated hepatocytes accumulate.

Young adult male rats were treated orally with NDPA at 6 weeks of age for 14 days using daily doses of 10, 20 and 40\u00a0mg/kg. Samples of the liver and BM tissues were harvested from each animal one day following the last treatment with NDPA and were evaluated for the frequencies of micronucleated cells. Repeated doses with 40\u00a0mg/kg/day of NDPA caused systemic and hepatic toxicity, including suppressed body weight gains and histopathological hepatic lesions. The frequencies of micronucleated HEPs were significantly increased in all the NDPA-treated groups in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, the induction of micronuclei in the BM was undetectable, even at the high dose level of 40\u00a0mg/kg, for which the inhibition of hematopoiesis was observed. For the detection of micronucleated HEPs induced by NDPA treatment, a 14-day administration period is adequate.

We have recently established the repeated-dose liver MN (RDLMN) assay in rats for integration into general toxicity studies. To investigate the effectiveness of the RDLMN assay, the genotoxic rodent hepatocarcinogen, monocrotaline (MCT), was administered by oral gavage to 6-week old male rats once daily for 14 days at 0.5 and 1.5\u00a0mg/kg/day, and for 28 days at 0.15, 0.5, 1.5, 3.75, 7.5 and 15\u00a0mg/kg/day. Then, MN induction was measured in the liver and bone marrow (BM), and histopathological hepatotoxicity was examined. Additionally, in order to evaluate the effects of repeated dosing periods on MN inducibility, a double-dose examination of MCT at doses of 15, 30 and 60\u00a0mg/kg/day in juvenile (26-days old) and young adult (7-weeks old) rats was also conducted, as an acute dose MN assay. The peripheral blood (PB) and liver were sampled at 48\u00a0h and 4 days after the second dosing, respectively. In the repeated-dose MN assay, MCT produced a positive result in the liver at a non-hepatotoxic lower dose level, but not in the BM at any dose level. In contrast, in the double-dose MN assay, MCT showed a negative result in the young adult rat livers, although it gave positive responses in the livers of juvenile rats and in the PB with both age groups. The maximum dose used in the repeated-dose assay was considerably lower than that used in the acute dose assay. These results suggest that a repeated dosing regimen is more suitable for the liver MN assay using young adult rats than an acute dose regimen, and the RDLMN assay might be capable of detecting genotoxic rodent hepatocarcinogens at dose levels that are typically undetectable in BM MN assays.",

KBrO3 did not increase the frequency of MNed cells in the liver and colon in any of the repeated dose studies. However, KBrO3 increased the frequency of MNed cells in the glandular stomach and bone marrow. Additionally, the MNed cell frequency in the glandular stomach was not significantly affected by the difference in the length of the administration period. These results suggest that performing the MN assay using the glandular stomach, which is the first tissue to contact agents after oral ingestion, is useful for evaluating the genotoxic potential of chemicals and that the glandular stomach MN assay could be integrated into general toxicity studies.",

To evaluate the performance of repeated dose liver and gastrointestinal tract micronucleus (MN) assays in young adult rats, MNNG was administered by oral gavage to male CD (SD) rats aged 6 weeks at doses of 0 (vehicle; 2.5% DMSO aqueous solution), 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, and 25\u00a0mg/kg/day once daily for 14 and 28 days, and the MN frequencies were examined in the hepatocytes, glandular stomach cells, and colonic cells. The MN induction in immature erythrocytes in the bone marrow of these animals was also simultaneously evaluated. The frequencies of micronucleated (MNed) glandular stomach cells were significantly increased in all MNNG treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner in both repeated dose studies. In contrast, the frequencies of MNed hepatocytes and colonic cells were not significantly increased compared to the vehicle control. In the bone marrow, a small but significant increase in the frequency of MNed immature erythrocytes was observed only at the highest dose in the 28-day study. Since a clear positive result in the glandular stomach agrees with the tissue specificity of tumor induction by this chemical, the MN assay with the glandular stomach, which is a direct contact site with high concentrations of test substances administered by oral gavage, may be useful for detecting genotoxic compounds that are short-lived in vivo, such as MNNG.",

Two victims died post-irradiation, due to acute intestinal radiation sickness (at 62 days) and tuberculosis (at 1.5 year). The other three victims received medical follow-ups and were monitored for 5 years with multiple cytogenetic analyses. Unstable chromosome aberrations, including dicentric and centric rings (dic\u00a0+\u00a0r) and the micronucleus frequency in binucleated lymphocytes, were monitored. In addition, G-banding karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) methods were used to analyze translocations, for exploring chromosome stability and for retrospective dosimetry. The results show that unstable chromosome aberrations (dic\u00a0+\u00a0r) declined each year, dropping to about 20\u201340% of initial levels by the 5th year. A similar trend was observed for the micronucleus frequency. Our results show that the translocation frequencies of the three victims, detected by G-banding karyotype, remained stable for the 5 years. Five years after irradiation, the translocation rates of the three victims (G-banding and FISH analyses) were similar. The retrospective estimated doses, reconstructed based on the translocation frequencies, were consistent with the biological doses estimated at the first day post-irradiation using dic\u00a0+\u00a0r. The results of this study indicate that chromosome translocation frequencies can be used as a biological dosimeter and are an excellent index for dose reconstruction.",

To test the hypothesis we used our recent published mechanistic mathematical model of DSB repair for DSB induced by selected protons, deuterons, and helium ions of different energies representing radiations of different qualities. In light of recent advances in experimental and computational techniques, the most appropriate method to study cellular responses in radiation therapy, and exposures to low doses of ionizing radiations is using mechanistic approaches. To this end, we proposed a \u2018bottom\u2013up\u2019 approach to study cellular response that starts with the DNA damage. Monte Carlo track structure method was employed to simulate initial damage induced in the genomic DNA by direct and indirect effects. Among the different types of DNA damage, DSB are known to be induced in simple and complex forms. The DSB repair model in G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle was employed to calculate the repair kinetics. The model considers the repair of simple and complex DSB, and the DSB produced in the heterochromatin. The inverse sampling method was used to calculate the repair kinetics for each individual DSB. The overall repair kinetics for 500 DSB induced by single tracks of the radiation under test were compared with experimental results. The results show that the model is capable of predicting the repair kinetics for the DSB induced by radiations of different qualities within an accepted range of uncertainty.",

Data from the micronucleus assay coupled with centromere staining and from the chromosome-aberration assay show the involvement of both clastogenic and aneugenic events. Experiments with the formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG)-modified comet assay showed a slight (non-significant) increase in FPG-sensitive sites in the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells but not in the human lymphocytes. Electron paramagnetic resonance spin-trapping results showed the presence of hydroxyl radicals (OH) in WC\u2013Co NP suspensions, with or without cells, but with time-dependent production in the presence of cells. However, a significant difference in OH production was observed between human lymphocytes from two different donors. Using H2O2, we showed that WC\u2013Co NP can participate in Fenton-like reactions. Thus, OH might be produced either via intrinsic generation by WC\u2013Co NP or through a Fenton-like reaction in the presence of cells.",

More recently, the selective action of capsaicin against cancer cells has been reported. Capsaicin was found to induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of a wide range of cancer cells in vitro, whereas being inactive against normal cells. As data on capsaicin-induced genotoxicity are limited and the effects of capsaicin against human lung A549 and DU145 prostate cancer cells were not explored in detail, we were interested in determining whether capsaicin-associated genotoxicity may also provoke A549 and DU145 cell death. Capsaicin-induced decrease in metabolic activity and cell proliferation, and changes in the cell cycle were limited to high concentrations used (\u2265100\u00a0\u03bcM), whereas, at lower concentrations, capsaicin stimulated both DNA double strand breaks and micronuclei production. Capsaicin was unable to provoke apoptotic cell death when used up to 250\u00a0\u03bcM concentrations. Capsaicin induced oxidative stress, but was ineffective in provoking the dissipation of the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential. A different magnitude of p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) recruitment contributed to diverse capsaicin-induced genotoxic effects in DU145 and A549 cells. Capsaicin was also found to be a DNA hypermethylating agent in A549 cells. In summary, we have shown that genotoxic effects of capsaicin may contribute to limited susceptibility of DU145 and A549 cancer cells to apoptosis in vitro, which may question the usefulness of capsaicin-based anticancer therapy, at least in a case of lung and prostate cancer.",

To determine the extent of tissue damage induced by TiO2 NPs in Drosophila larvae, the trypan blue dye exclusion test was also applied. Both compounds were supplied to third instar larvae by ingestion at concentration ranging from 0.08 to 1.60\u00a0mg/mL. The results obtained in the present study indicate that TiO2 NPs can reach and induce cytotoxic effects on midgut and imaginal disc tissues of larvae, but they do not promote genotoxicity in the wing-spot test of Drosophila. However, when both nano- and large-size forms of TiO2 were evaluated with the comet assay in Drosophila hemocytes, a significant increase in DNA damage, with a direct dose-response pattern, was observed for TiO2 NPs. The results obtained with the comet assay suggest that the primary DNA damage associated with TiO2 NPs exposure in Drosophila could be associated with specific physico-chemical properties of nano-TiO2, since no effects were observed with the bulk form.

Both neurotoxins significantly decreased the viability of astrocytes, augmented the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the astrocyte marker \u2013 glial fibrillar acidic protein. A significantly decreased mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, augmented reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, caspase-3 mRNA level, chromatin condensation and DNA damage was observed in 6-OHDA/LPS treated astroglial cells. 6-OHDA/LPS treatment also caused the significantly increased expression of iNOS and nitrite level. Findings showed that 6-OHDA/LPS treatment caused mitochondrial dysfunction mediated death of astrocytes, which significantly involve the nitric oxide. Since we have observed significantly increased level of iNOS along with mitochondrial impairment and apoptotic cell death in astrocytes, therefore to validate the role of iNOS, the cells were co-treated with iNOS inhibitor aminoguanidine (AG, 100\u00a0\u03bcM).

DNA repair gene expression in PFC exhibited a general trend towards an induction after acute stress and a decrease after subchronic exposure compared to control animals. After chronic stress, a normalization towards control levels was observed. A similar pattern was seen in HC, but with overall smaller effects and without the induction after acute stress. Nuclear DNA damage from oxidation as measured by the comet assay was unaffected by stress in both regions. We conclude that psychological stress have a dynamic influence on brain DNA repair gene expression; however, since we were unable to identify concurrent changes in DNA damage from oxidation, the down-stream consequences of this regulation, if any, remains unclear.",

     "abstract": "Humans are exposed to health-impairing air pollutants, especially children who are more sensitive to cancer-causing toxins. This study described an area of reference for inhalable particulates (PM2.5) by chemical (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) and mutagenic characterization associated with the genetic biomonitoring of children (aged 5\u201311 years). The area studied was in a small town in Brazil, used as reference in previous studies. Organic matter of PM2.5 (extracted with dichloromethane) was evaluated for mutagenesis in a Salmonella/microsome (microsuspension) assay, in strains measuring frameshift error (TA98, YG1021 and YG1024) and base pair substitution (TA100) of DNA, in the presence and absence of rat liver metabolization fraction (S9). Exposure was studied analyzing a sample of 45 children using comet assay (peripheral blood lymphocytes) and micronucleus (exfoliated buccal mucosa cells). PM2.5 concentration for the period was 9% (25.89\u201364.71\u00a0\u03bcg/m3) events above WHO limit value (25\u00a0\u03bcg/m3). Mutagenesis responses (revertants/m3) varied from negative (spring) to 8.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.69 (autumn) (\u2212S9) and 5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36 (winter) (+S9), in strain TA98, and for TA100, in spring, from negative to 14.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.23 (\u2212S9) and 17.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.72 (+S9). YG strain results show mononitroarenes and aromatic amines. Mean biomonitoring values were established for MN, 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41 (\u2030) and for other cell types a variation from 0.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.73 (\u2030), nuclear buds to 57.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024.92 (\u2030), karyorrhexis. Comet assay means were 23.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.44; 7.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.66 and 0.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.30 for tail length, intensity and moment, respectively. There was no difference for sex and age for the different parameters. A significant difference in confounding factors was observed for passive smoking and MN induction. PAHs and mutagenesis in the air may be related to local vehicular emissions. These results challenge the definition of areas of reference for air pollution associated with human biomonitoring including the region studied.",

Thus, smoke-infused water and the active smoke-derived compounds have the potential to be used in different agricultural and horticultural applications. However, despite these interesting and potentially practical properties, it should also be ascertained whether such compounds may pose a health risk, particularly if they are to be used in the production of food or fodder crops. Amongst some of the aspects that would be important to understand are any possible genotoxic properties that the compounds may possess due to potential carry-over effects. Here, we report on a genotoxicity study of 3,4,5-trimethylfuran-2(5H)-one, a compound from plant-derived smoke previously shown to have germination inhibitory activity. Using two in vitro tests, namely the bacterial VITOTOX\u00ae test (with/without S9 metabolic activation) and the cytome assay on human C3A cells, no genotoxicity or toxicity was found. Furthermore, these results support a previous study where a related smoke-derived compound with germination promoting properties was investigated.",

Artesunate significantly reduced epididymal sperm count and increased the frequency of sperms with abnormal head morphology following 24\u00a0h of exposure. Comet assay analysis revealed significant increase in DNA strand breaks in spermatozoa evidenced by about 3-fold increase in comet tail DNA and up to 10-fold increase in Olive tail moment following 35 days of artesunate treatment. The damage index was significantly higher in the treated groups (40.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.62 and 37.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.35 for ART1 and ART2 respectively) as compared to the control group (16.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.21) indicating the genotoxic effect of artesunate. The significant reduction in GSH, SOD and increase in lipid peroxidation indicate involvement of oxidative mechanisms in artesunate induced toxicity in mice. The present study suggests that artesunate has the potential to breach the testis\u2013blood barrier and cause toxicity to male germ cells which may have implications in male reproductive toxicity.",

Consequently, follow-up testing strategies are needed for positive compounds to determine their mode of action, which would then allow for deployment of appropriate in vivo follow-up strategies. We have chosen 3 micronucleus positive compounds, the clastogen etoposide, the aneugen noscapine and the cytotoxicant tunicamycin to evaluate different approaches to determine their aneugenic or clastogenic properties. Each of the three compounds were evaluated following 4 and 24\u00a0h of continuous treatment by flow cytometry for micronucleus induction, the aneugenicity markers phosphorylated-histone 3 (p-H3) and polyploidy, the clastogenicity marker \u03b3H2AX and the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase 3. They were further evaluated by Western blot for mono-ubiquitinated and \u03b3H2AX. Results show that the clastogen etoposide produced a dose related increase in \u03b3H2AX and mono-ubiquitinated H2AX and a dose related decrease in p-H3 positive mitotic cells. Conversely, the aneugen produced increases in p-H3 and polyploidy with no significant increases seen in mono-ubiquitinated H2AX or \u03b3H2AX. Lastly, the cytotoxicant tunicamycin induced neither an increase in p-H3 nor \u03b3H2AX. All three compounds produced dose-related increases in cleaved caspase 3. The results from this study provide evidence that adding clastogenicity and aneugenicity markers to the in vitro micronucleus assay in TK6 cells could help to identify the mode of action of positive compounds. The combination of endpoints suggested here needs to be further evaluated by a broader set of test compounds.",

     "abstract": "The phenolic anti-oxidant 3-hydroxytyrosol (HT) is a major constituent of olives and olive oil. Published data showed it was negative in the Ames test at concentrations up to 5\u00a0\u03bcL per plate, but did induce chromosomal aberrations in human lymphocytes. HIDROX, an olive extract containing approximately 2.4% HT, was reported as both positive and equivocal in an Ames test in different papers from the same laboratory. Negative results for micronucleus induction in vivo in both an acute study and as part of a 90-day rat toxicity study were also reported for HIDROX.Given the widespread use and consumption of olives, olive oil and olive extracts, it was important to obtain more data. Here we confirm that pure HT, and an olive extract containing 15% HT, both induced micronuclei in cultured cells in vitro, but show that these responses were either due to high levels of cytotoxicity or to reaction of HT with culture medium components to produce hydrogen peroxide. Another extract (H40) containing 40% HT also induced micronuclei in vitro, probably via the same mechanism. However, both extracts were negative in robust Ames tests.The 15% HT formulated extract did not induce micronuclei in rat bone marrow after 4 weeks of dosing up to 561\u00a0mg HT/kg/day. H40 produced increased rat bone marrow micronucleus frequencies at 250 and 500\u00a0mg HT/kg/day in a 90-day toxicity study, but the results were questionable for various reasons. However, when two different batches of this extract were tested in acute micronucleus studies at doses up to 2000\u00a0mg HT/kg, giving plasma exposures that exceeded those in the 90-day study, negative results were obtained. Based on weight of evidence it is concluded that the olive extracts tested are not genotoxic at high doses in vivo, and any genotoxic risks for human consumers are negligible.",

     "abstract": "Diesel exhausts are partly responsible for the deleterious effects on human health associated with urban pollution, including cardiovascular diseases, asthma, COPD, and possibly lung cancer. Particulate fraction has been incriminated and thus largely investigated for its genotoxic properties, based on exposure conditions that are, however, not relevant for human risk assessment. In this paper, original and more realistic protocols were used to investigate the hazards induced by exhausts emitted by the combustion of standard (DF0) vs. bio-diesel fuels (DF7 and DF30) and to assess the impact of exhaust treatment devices (DOC and DPF). Mutagenicity and genotoxicity were evaluated for (1) resuspended particles (\u201coff line\u201d exposure that takes into account the bioavailability of adsorbed chemicals) and for (2) the whole aerosols (particles\u00a0+\u00a0gas phase components) under continuous flow exposure (\u201con line\u201d exposure). Native particles displayed mutagenic properties associated with nitroaromatic profiles (YG1041), whereas PAHs did not seem to be involved. After DOC treatment, the mutagenicity of particles was fully abolished. In contrast, the level of particle deposition was low under continuous flow exposure, and the observed mutagenicity in TA98 and TA102 was thus attributable to the gas phase. A bactericidal effect was also observed in TA102 after DOC treatment, and a weak but significant mutagenicity persisted after DPF treatment for bio-diesel fuels. No formation of bulky DNA-adducts was observed on A549 cells exposed to diesel exhaust, even in very drastic conditions (organic extracts corresponding to 500\u00a0\u03bcg equivalent particule/mL, 48\u00a0h exposure). Taken together, these data indicate that the exhausts issued from the bio-diesel fuels supplemented with rapseed methyl ester (RME), and generated by current diesel engines equipped with after treatment devices are less mutagenic than older ones. The residual mutagenicity is linked to the gas phase and could be due to pro-oxydants, mainly for RME-supplemented fuels.",

     "abstract": "In Mexico, as in many other countries, traditional medicine is used for the treatment of several diseases. In particular, Amphipterygium adstringens infusion is used for gastritis, gastric ulcers, and gastric cancer. Extracts from this tree have microbicidal effects against Helicobacter pylori, an important risk factor for gastric cancer development. Anacardic acids are constituents of A. adstringens, and 6-pentadecyl salicylic acid (6-PSA) is the most abundant. However, there is a lack of information regarding the effects of 6-PSA on cancer cells. Therefore, we investigated whether 6-PSA has differential effects on the induction of genotoxicity, cytostaticity, and apoptosis in normal human peripheral blood mononucleated cells (PBMCs), bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes of Balb/c mice, and human transformed cell lines derived from both gastric cancer (AGS cells) and leukaemia (K562 cells).Treatment with 6-PSA (30\u2013150\u00a0\u03bcM) reduced the viability of AGS and K562 cells together with a moderate, but significant, increase in the frequency of micronucleated cells and the induction of DNA breakage (Comet Assay). Moreover, 6-PSA increased the apoptosis rate in both the AGS and K562 cell lines in a caspase 8-dependent manner. In contrast, neither cytotoxicity nor genotoxicity were observed in PBMCs or bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes of Balb/c mice after treatment with low doses of 6-PSA (0.2\u20132.0\u00a0mg/Kg). Instead, 6-PSA treatment resulted in the inhibition of PBMC proliferation, which was reversible after the compound was removed. Additionally, 6-PSA treatments (2\u201320\u00a0mg/Kg) increased the frequency of mature polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow, suggesting a possible effect on the differentiation process of immune cells.The present results indicate that 6-PSA induces cytotoxicity and moderate genotoxicity, together with an increase in the apoptosis rate, in a caspase 8-dependent manner in gastric cancer cells. In contrast, a low toxicity was observed when PBMCs were exposed to 6-PSA.",

Pre-treatment with \u03b2-glucan, 1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, for 72\u00a0h protected HepG2 cells against radiation, as indicated by increased surviving fraction, reduced apoptosis, and fewer DNA strand breaks. These results show that barley \u03b2-glucan is a radioprotective agent.",

     "abstract": "Cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs; nanoceria) have demonstrated excellent potential for commercial use in various arenas, such as in biomedical industry in cosmetics and as a fuel additive. However, limited knowledge exists regarding their potential toxicity. In this study, acute oral toxicity of CeO2 NPs and their microparticles (MPs; bulk) was carried out in female albino Wistar rats. The CeO2 NPs and CeO2 MPs were characterized utilizing transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) for the size, distribution and surface charge respectively. The genotoxicity studies were conducted using micronucleus test (MNT), comet and chromosomal aberration (CA) assays. Results revealed that at high dose (1000\u00a0mg/kg bw) CeO2 NPs induced significant DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) and liver cells, micronucleus formation in bone marrow and blood cells and total cytogenetic changes in bone marrow. However, significant genotoxicity was not observed at 500 and 100\u00a0mg/kg bw of CeO2 NPs. The findings from biochemical assays depicted significant alterations in ALP and LDH activity in serum and GSH content in liver, kidneys and brain only at the high dose of CeO2 NPs. Tissue biodistribution of both particles was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES). Bioaccumulation of nanoceria in all tissues was significant and dose-, time- and organ-dependent. Moreover, CeO2 NPs exhibited higher tissue distribution along with greater clearance in large fractions through urine and feces than CeO2 bulk, whereas, maximum amount of micro-sized CeO2 got excreted in feces. The histopathological examination documented alterations in the liver due to exposure with CeO2 NPs only. Hence, the results suggest that bioaccumulation of CeO2 NPs may induce genotoxic effects. However, further research on long term fate and adverse effects of CeO2 NPs is warranted.",

The micronucleus indices obtained were used as biomarker to estimate and predict pollution profile and possible danger of feeding on the aquatic species. Micronuclei profile of the fish was measured from gill and kidney erythrocytes using microscopic technique. Season, species and location effects on micronuclei, together with their interactions were also determined. Two major seasons (rainy and dry) and preponderant fish species in the river (Synodontis clarias, Linnaeus, 1758 and Tilapia nilotica, Linnaeus, 1757) were studied at five distinct locations that displayed differential environmental stresses. The study showed that the micronucleus index of fish is an excellent biomarker for measuring pollution level and genotoxicity of freshwater habitat. Season, species of fish and location affect micronuclei profile of the fish species sampled in the river. Disease outbreak among rural dwellers depending on the river for domestic and other uses is imminent and they lack knowledge on its health implication. Moreover, the study maintained that the micronuclei in fish could be measured from either the gill or kidney; however, gill is more efficient as it enables collection of several samples from the same individuals without sacrificing it, and Synodontis clarias fish species appeared to be more vulnerable to the genotoxic damage than Tilapia nilotica. Consequently, the study recommended regular monitoring (micronucleus tests) of edible aquatic life such as Synodontis clarias in order to eliminate the danger of people feeding on toxic metals, some of which are carcinogenic.",

Only a few studies deal with non sinusoidal ELF-MF, including pulsed magnetic field (PMF), which are produced by several devices. The aim of this study is to investigate whether PMF exposure can interfere with DNA damage and repair in the presence of a genotoxic oxidative agent in neuronal type cells. To this purpose gamma-H2AX foci formation, which is a sensitive marker of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), was investigated at different points of time (1, 24, 48, 72\u00a0h) after the H2O2 treatment (300\u00a0\u03bcM for 1\u00a0h) under PMF exposure (1\u00a0mT, 50\u00a0Hz) in human neuroblastoma BE(2)C cells.

Taken together, results suggest that PMF exposure does not interfere with genotoxicity and cytotoxicity induced by oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread heavy metal used in numerous industrial processes. Cd exerts toxicological effects mostly in kidney and liver. Bone is also an important target of Cd, however, the cellular mechanisms of Cd toxicological effects in the bone cells are still poorly understood. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the putative cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of Cd to human bone cells. For that, the osteoblast-like MG-63 cells were exposed to 20 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM Cd for 24 and 48\u00a0h. Results showed a dose-dependent increase in Cd accumulation in cells and a decrease in cell viability, especially after 48\u00a0h. Cell cycle analysis showed a delay at S phase concomitant with a decrease in cells at G0/G1 phase. After 24\u00a0h, Cd treatment downregulated the expression of CHEK1, CHEK2 and CDK2 genes and upregulated the expression of CCNE1 gene. After 48\u00a0h, the expression of ATM and CCNB1 genes were downregulated. Also, a 3.3 fold increase on the expression of gene CCNE1 was detected. Both Cd doses induced DNA fragmentation at 48\u00a0h, while an increase in micronuclei (MN) and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) together with an increase in the percentage of apoptotic/necrotic cells was detected for both time periods. Overall, our results demonstrate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of Cd in human bone cells. Also, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay parameters (MN, NPBs and the percentage of cells under apoptosis or necrosis) together with the cell cycle appear as the most sensitive to Cd cyto- and genotoxicity, being early affected even with the lowest Cd dose. Therefore, these cyto-/genotoxic techniques may be selected for early detection of Cd-induced toxicity.",

     "abstract": "Genetic mutations are known to drive cancer progression and certain tumors have mutation signatures that reflect exposures to environmental carcinogens. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) has a known mutation signature and has proven capable of inducing changes to DNA sequence that drives normal pre-stasis human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) past a first tumor suppressor barrier (stasis) and toward immortality. We analyzed normal, pre-stasis HMEC, three independent BaP-derived post-stasis HMEC strains (184Aa, 184Be, 184Ce) and two of their immortal derivatives(184A1 and 184BE1) by whole exome sequencing. The independent post-stasis strains exhibited between 93 and 233 BaP-induced mutations in exons. Seventy percent of the mutations were C:G\u00a0>\u00a0A:T transversions, consistent with the known mutation spectrum of BaP. Mutations predicted to impact protein function occurred in several known and putative cancer drivers including p16, PLCG1, MED12, TAF1 in 184Aa; PIK3CG, HSP90AB1, WHSC1L1, LCP1 in 184Be and FANCA, LPP in 184Ce. Biological processes that typically harbor cancer driver mutations such as cell cycle, regulation of cell death and proliferation, RNA processing, chromatin modification and DNA repair were found to have mutations predicted to impact function in each of the post-stasis strains. Spontaneously immortalized HMEC lines derived from two of the BaP-derived post-stasis strains shared greater than 95% of their BaP-induced mutations with their precursor cells. These immortal HMEC had 10 or fewer additional point mutations relative to their post-stasis precursors, but acquired chromosomal anomalies during immortalization that arose independent of BaP. The results of this study indicate that acute exposures of HMEC to high dose BaP recapitulate mutation patterns of human tumors and can induce mutations in a number of cancer driver genes.",

     "abstract": "Positive results in the Ames test correlate well with carcinogenic potential in rodents. This correlation is not perfect because mutations are only one of many stages in tumour development. Also, situations can be envisaged where the mutagenic response may be specific to the bacteria or the test protocol, e.g., bacterial-specific metabolism, exceeding a detoxification threshold, or the induction of oxidative damage to which bacteria may be more sensitive than mammalian cells in vitro or tissues in vivo. Since most chemicals are also tested for genotoxicity in mammalian cells, the pattern of mammalian cell results may help identify whether Ames-positive results predict carcinogenic or in vivo mutagenic activity. A workshop was therefore organised and sponsored by the EU Reference Laboratory for Alternatives to Animal Testing (EURL ECVAM) to investigate this further. Participants presented results from other genotoxicity tests with Ames-positive compounds. Data came from published, regulatory agency, and industry sources. The question was posed whether negative results in mammalian cell tests were associated with absence of carcinogenic or in vivo genotoxic activity despite a positive Ames test. In the limited time available, the presented data were combined and an initial analysis suggested that the association of negative in vitro mammalian cell test results with lack of in vivo genotoxic or carcinogenic activity could have some significance. Possible reasons why a positive Ames test may not be associated with in vivo activity and what additional investigations/tests might contribute to a more robust evaluation were discussed. Because a considerable overlap was identified among the different databases presented, it was recommended that a consolidated database be built, with overlapping chemicals removed, so that a more robust analysis of the predictive capacity for potential carcinogenic and in vivo genotoxic activity could be derived from the patterns of mammalian cell test results obtained for Ames-positive compounds.",

     "abstract": "A Workshop sponsored by EURL ECVAM was held in Ispra, Italy in 2013 to consider whether the in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity test results could complement and mitigate the implications of a positive Ames test response for the prediction of in vivo genotoxicity and carcinogenicity, and if patterns of results could be identified. Databases of Ames-positive chemicals that were tested for in vivo genotoxicity and/or carcinogenicity were collected from different sources and analysed individually (Kirkland et al., in this issue). Because there were overlaps and inconsistent test results among chemicals in the different databases, a combined database which eliminated the overlaps and evaluated the inconsistencies was considered preferable for addressing the above question. A database of >700 Ames-positive chemicals also tested in vivo was compiled, and the results in in vitro mammalian cell tests were analysed. Because the database was limited to Ames-positive chemicals, the majority (>85%) of carcinogens (103/119) and in vivo genotoxins (83/88) were positive when tested in both in vitro gene mutation and aneugenicity/clastogenicity tests. However, about half (>45%) of chemicals that were not carcinogenic (19/28) or genotoxic in vivo (33/73) also gave the same patterns of positive mammalian cell results. Although the different frequencies were statistically significant, positive results in 2 in vitro mammalian cell tests did not, per se, add to the predictivity of the positive Ames test. By contrast, negative results for both in vitro mammalian cell endpoints were rare for Ames-positive carcinogens (3/119) and in vivo genotoxins (2/88) but, were significantly more frequent for Ames-positive chemicals that are not carcinogenic (4/28) or genotoxic in vivo (14/73). Thus, in the case of an Ames-positive chemical, negative results in 2 in vitro mammalian cell tests covering both mutation and clastogenicity/aneugenicity endpoints should be considered as indicative of absence of in vivo genotoxic or carcinogenic potential.",

This paper summarizes a survey suggested by the Safety Working Party of European Medicines Agency (EMA), and conducted by the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) to investigate the experience among European pharmaceutical companies by conducting the in vivo comet assay for regulatory purpose. A special focus was given on the typology of the obtained results and to identify potential difficulties encountered with the interpretation of study data.The participating companies reported a total of 147 studies (conducted in-house or outsourced) and shared the conclusion on the comet assay response for 136 studies. Most of the studies were negative (118/136). Only about 10% (14/136 studies) of the comet assays showed a positive response. None of the positive comet assay results were clearly associated with organ toxicity indicating that the positive responses are not due to cytotoxic effects of the compound in the tissue examined. The number of comet assays with an equivocal or inconclusive response was rare, respectively <1% (1/147 studies) and 2% (3/147 studies). In case additional information (e.g. repeat assay, organ toxicity, metabolism, tissue exposure) would have been available for evaluation, a final conclusion could most probably have been drawn for most or all of these studies. All (46) negative in vivo comet assays submitted alongside with a negative in vivo micronucleus assay were accepted by the regulatory authorities to mitigate a positive in vitro mammalian cell assay following the current ICH S2 guidance.

The measurements on the induction of \u03b3-H2AX foci and micronuclei frequency in the cell nuclei indicated that pretreatment with DSePA significantly prevented the radiation induced DNA damage or genotoxicity and subsequent cytotoxicity without exerting its own toxicity. The maximum protective effect of DSePA was seen at a pre-treatment concentration of 3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. The mechanistic investigations in CHO cells revealed that DSePA pretreatment prevented the radiation induced ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and subsequent apoptosis in these cells. Further, it was seen to augment the mRNA expressions of GPx2 significantly and GPx4 marginally without causing much change in the total GPx activity after radiation exposure. These results suggested the roles of GPx2 and GPx4 in DSePA mediated radioprotection. In conclusion our results confirm the nongenotoxic nature of the DSePA and validate its radioprotective efficacy and mechanisms of action in model cellular systems.",

     "abstract": "In the field of contaminated sites and soil management, chemical analyses only bring typological data about pollution. As far as bioavailability and effects on organisms are concerned, we need ecotoxicology tools. In this domain, among many existing tests, we chose to study genotoxicity because it is a short-term endpoint with long-term consequences. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of soil pH on the results of the Vicia faba root tip micronucleus test for the two following reasons: (i) to define the pH range within which the test can be performed without modifying the soil to be tested, within the framework of the ISO standard of the test and (ii) to provides information about the effects of the pH on the genotoxic potential of soils. In this context, we modified the pH of a standard soil with HCl or NaOH and we spiked the matrix with copper (2, 4 and 8\u00a0mmol\u00a0kg\u22121 dry soil) or with maleic hydrazide, an antigerminative chemical (5, 10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcmol\u00a0kg\u22121 dry soil). We concluded that the pH had no effect on the mitotic index or micronucleus frequency in the root cells of the negative controls: extreme pH values did not induce micronucleus formation in root cells. Moreover, according to our results, the Vicia-micronucleus test can be performed with pH values ranging between 3.2 and 9.0, but in the ISO 29200 \u201cSoil quality \u2013 assessment of genotoxic effects on higher plants \u2013 V. faba micronucleus test\u201d we recommended to use a control soil with a pH value ranging between 5 and 8 for a more accurate assessment of chemical genotoxicity. We also found that acid pH could increase the genotoxic potential of pollutants, especially heavy metals. With hydrazide maleic spiked soil, plants were placed in a situation of double stress, i.e. toxicity caused by extreme pH values and toxicity induced by the pollutant.",

We analyzed DNA damage induced by 2\u00a0Gy \u03b3-ray radiation in an intestinal commensal bacteria-depleted mouse model (CD group), in which TLRs (TLR2/6, TLR4 and TLR5) ligand levels in serum were reduced. Chromosomal aberrations were measured in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood leukocyte comet assays were performed. DNA damage was increased in the CD group compared with the control group. Treatment of mice with TLR agonists (CBLB502, LPS and lipopeptide) 1\u00a0h before radiation resulted in a significant decrease in DNA damage. Genes induced by TLR5 activation were analyzed; activation of TLRs regulated the expression of Gadd45b, Sod2, and Rad21, which are involved in DNA damage repair. In summary, our data indicate that TLRs activation by intestinal microflora reduces DNA damage induced by radiation and regulates expression of several DNA repair genes.",

     "abstract": "The in vivo Comet assay is a sensitive method for evaluating DNA damage. A recurrent concern is how to analyze the data appropriately and efficiently. A popular approach is to summarize the raw data into a summary statistic prior to the statistical analysis. However, consensus on which summary statistic to use has yet to be reached. Another important consideration concerns the assessment of proper sample sizes in the design of Comet assay studies. This study aims to identify a statistic suitably summarizing the % tail DNA of mice testicular samples in Comet assay studies. A second aim is to provide curves for this statistic outlining the number of animals and gels to use. The current study was based on 11 compounds administered via oral gavage in three doses to male mice: CAS no. 110-26-9, CAS no. 512-56-1, CAS no. 111873-33-7, CAS no. 79-94-7, CAS no. 115-96-8, CAS no. 598-55-0, CAS no. 636-97-5, CAS no. 85-28-9, CAS no. 13674-87-8, CAS no. 43100-38-5 and CAS no. 60965-26-6. Testicular cells were examined using the alkaline version of the Comet assay and the DNA damage was quantified as % tail DNA using a fully automatic scoring system. From the raw data 23 summary statistics were examined. A linear mixed-effects model was fitted to the summarized data and the estimated variance components were used to generate power curves as a function of sample size. The statistic that most appropriately summarized the within-sample distributions was the median of the log-transformed data, as it most consistently conformed to the assumptions of the statistical model. Power curves for 1.5-, 2-, and 2.5-fold changes of the highest dose group compared to the control group when 50 and 100 cells were scored per gel are provided to aid in the design of future Comet assay studies on testicular cells.",

     "abstract": "Effective biomonitoring for detection of radiation-induced genotoxicity of contaminants in natural environments involves testing of field plants for cytogenetic changes. To increase the efficiency and precision of cytogenetic analyses of field plants that have naturally high individual variability, an improved micronucleus assay is proposed that employs a cytokinesis block technique similar to the lymphocyte test system used in mammals. In seed embryonic meristems of the Japanese cedar, application of a methylxanthine derivative, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), was found to be effective in inhibiting cytokinesis to make once-divided cells easily recognizable by their binucleate appearance. In the meristem of IBMX-treated seminal roots from X-ray-irradiated seeds, variation in micronucleus frequency in the binucleate cell population was reduced compared to that in the total cell population. The highest efficiency of measurement of micronucleus frequencies was obtained in the root meristems where 0.2- to 1.5-mm-long seminal roots were incubated with IBMX for 24\u00a0h. This result indicated that this root elongation stage corresponded to the first divisions of the root meristematic cells, and was therefore suitable for obtaining reliable estimations of accumulated genetic damage in the seeds. This cytokinesis block assay applied specifically at the root elongation stage was then used to examine dose\u2013response relationships in Japanese cedar seeds irradiated either acutely with X-rays or chronically with \u03b3-rays. The resulting dose\u2013response curve for the acute X-ray irradiation was fitted onto a linear\u2013quadratic regression curve, whereas the dose\u2013response curve for the chronic \u03b3-irradiation matched a linear regression line better. Both dose\u2013response curves were consistent with the target theory of classical radiation biology. The good agreement of the micronucleus data to a simple dose\u2013response model indicates the proposed accuracy of the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay for plant monitoring.",

A lethal effect was used as the end point for mortality, whereas frequency of micronuclei (MNs) and DNA single-strand breaks evaluated by the single cell gel electrophoresis assay were employed as end points for genotoxicity. Mortality studies revealed an LC50 96\u00a0h value of 1639\u00a0mg/L (range, 1471\u20131808) of dicamba. Furthermore, behavioral changes, e.g., gathering at the bottom of the aquarium, slowness in motion, abnormal swimming, and slow reaction, were observed. Whereas increased frequency of MNs was observed when 1229\u00a0mg/L dicamba was assayed for 48\u00a0h, no induction of MNs was observed in fish exposed to the herbicide for 96\u00a0h, regardless of the concentration of dicamba. Furthermore, other nuclear abnormalities, i.e., binucleated cells and lobed and notched nuclei, were induced in fish exposed for 48\u00a0h but not 96\u00a0h. Increase in the genetic damage index was observed in those treatments (lasting for both 48 and 96\u00a0h) within the 410\u20131229\u00a0mg/L dicamba concentration-range. This study represents the first evidence of acute lethal and sublethal effects exerted by dicamba on a piscine species native to Argentina. The results could indicate that dicamba-based formulation Banvel\u00ae is the less toxic emerging pollutant reported so far for C. decemmaculatus.

Despite the possible beneficial effects of HSP90 inhibitors, some of these agents present a genotoxicity liability. We have examined the mode of action of micronucleus formation in TK6 cells by a novel and highly specific HSP90 inhibitor, CH5164840, by means of an in vitro micronucleus test with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), \u03b3H2AX staining to detect DNA damage, and microscopic observation of chromosomal alignment in mitotic cells. The percentage of centromere-positive micronuclei induced by CH5164840 (FISH analysis) was significant, but the percentage of centromere-negative ones was not, suggesting that induction of micronuclei was due to a mechanism of aneugenicity rather than DNA reactivity. This conclusion was further supported by the result of co-staining \u03b3H2AX and the apoptosis marker caspase-3; the predominant elevation of apoptotic \u03b3H2AX rather than non-apoptotic \u03b3H2AX indicated little involvement of DNA-reactivity mechanisms. Microscopic observation revealed asymmetric spindle microtubules and chromosomal misalignment of metaphase cells. These data indicated that CH5164840 causes spindle dysfunction that induces micronuclei. The risk/benefit ratio must be considered in the development of HSP90 inhibitors.",

The applied dose was 5\u00a0Gy. Cells were exposed in the axis and four cm outside the radiation field. Radiation-induced genetic changes were estimated as frequency of micro-nucleated and apopototic-like cells, by use of a cytokinesis-block micronucleus test.A smaller dose rate induced more severe cytogenetic damage (formation of micro-nucleated and apoptotic cells) than a higher dose rate, both in normal and in cancer cells. More micro-nucleated and apoptotic cells were formed at larger depth than at smaller depth. This holds true for both the normal and the two types of cancer cell investigated. The extent of cytogenetic damage arising in cells placed outside the irradiation field is independent of positioning depth and dose rate.Exposure of cells to smaller dose rates and larger depths in water medium resulted in a better ratio of cytogenetic damage to cancer cells irradiated in the beam axis vs damage to normal cells exposed outside the radiation field.",

Assay reliability and reproducibility were evaluated with four known genotoxicants, and the results obtained with the FCM method were compared with the outcome of the traditional evaluation of bone-marrow micronuclei by use of microscopy. Each of the four chemicals was tested at three sites (two in China and the one US reference laboratory). After three consecutive daily exposures to a genotoxicant, blood and bone-marrow samples were obtained from rats 24\u00a0h after the third dose. MN-RET frequencies were measured in 20,000 RET in blood by FCM, and micro-nucleated polychromatic erythrocyte (MN-PCE) frequencies were measured in 2,000 PCEs in bone marrow by microscopy. For both methods, each genotoxicant was shown to induce a statistically significant increase in the frequency of MN after treatment with at least one dose. Where more doses than one caused an increase, responses occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Spearman's correlation coefficient (rs) for FCM-based MN-RET vs microscopy-based MN-PCE measurements (eight experiments, 200 paired measurements) was 0.723, indicating a high degree of correspondence between methods and compartments. The rs value for replicate FCM MN-RET measurements performed at the eight collaborative laboratories was 0.940 (n\u00a0=\u00a0200), and between the eight FCM laboratories with the reference laboratory was 0.933 (n\u00a0=\u00a0200), suggesting that the automated method is very well transferable between laboratories.

     "abstract": "Although medical ultrasound offers compelling opportunities to improve therapy in principle, progress in the field has been limited because of an insufficient understanding of the potential genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of ultrasound on biological systems. This paper is mainly focused on an in vitro study of effects with respect to genotoxicity and viability induced by 1- and 3-MHz medical ultrasound in murine fibroblasts (NIH-3T3) at low-intensity exposure (spatial peak temporal average intensity Ita\u00a0<\u00a00.1\u00a0W/cm2). The NIH-3T3 cells constitute a well-characterized in vitro cell model in which a genotoxic effect can be predicted by means of a reliable and precise murine cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. A statistically significant increase in the incidence of micronuclei was observed in sonicated 3T3 cells. In particular, the effects were more evident at 1\u00a0MHz. Moreover, for each frequency investigated, the occurrence of micronuclei was comparatively more frequent with increasing time of exposure. The possible toxicological implications of the medical ultrasound employed herein deal with the existence of a window of exposure parameters (set well below the intensity of ultrasound cavitation) in which some genotoxic effects may occur without significant cytotoxicity. In this respect, they provide new insight toward the correct risk to benefit balancing of ultrasound-based treatments and for designing innovative therapeutic strategies.",

The in vivo alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay is currently being prepared to become such a TG. The performance of a combined SCGE/Pig-a gene mutation study was evaluated with the prototypical genotoxicant benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) at an exposure level known to induce germ cell mutation. We aimed to better understand (i) the strengths and weaknesses of the two methods applied in blood and their potential to predict germ cell mutagenicity, and (ii) the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following in vivo BaP-exposure. To explore the involvement of ROS on BaP genotoxicity, we utilised a mouse model deficient in a DNA glycosylase. Specifically, C57BL/6 mice (Ogg1+/+ and Ogg1\u2212/\u2212) were treated for three consecutive days with 50\u00a0mg BaP/kg/day. DNA damage in nucleated blood cells was measured four hours after the last treatment with the SCGE assay, with and without formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (Fpg). Pig-a mutant phenotype blood erythrocytes were analysed two and four weeks after treatment. BaP-induced DNA lesions were not significantly increased in either version of the SCGE assay. The phenotypic mutation frequencies for immature and mature erythrocytes were significantly increased after two weeks. These effects were not affected by genotype, suggesting oxidative damage may have a minor role in BaP genotoxicity, at least in the acute exposure situation studied here. While both assays are promising tools for risk assessment, these results highlight the necessity of understanding the limitations regarding each assay's ability to detect chemicals\u2019 genotoxic potential.",

This study investigated the DNA damage induced by two major inorganic particulate matter compounds found in diesel exhaust, ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulfate, on Burkitt's lymphoma (Raji) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cell lines. We found a dose-dependent positive correlation of accumulated DNA damage at concentrations of ammonium nitrate (25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 400\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) with ultraviolet exposure (250\u00a0J/m2, 400\u00a0J/m2, 600\u00a0J/m2, 850\u00a0J/m2), as measured by the comet assay in both cell lines. There was a significant difference between the treated ammonium nitrate samples and negative control samples in Raji and HepG2 cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Apoptosis was shown in Raji and HepG2 cells when exposed to high concentrations of ammonium nitrate (200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 400\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 1\u00a0h in samples without ultraviolet exposure, as assessed by the comet assay. However, the level of apoptosis greatly diminished after ultraviolet exposure at these concentrations. Over a 24\u00a0h period, at intervals of 1, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24\u00a0h, we also observed that ammonium nitrate decreased viability in Raji and HepG2 cell lines and inhibited cell growth. Ammonium sulfate-induced DNA damage was minimal in both cell lines, but there remained a significant difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) between the ultraviolet radiation treated and negative control samples. These results indicate that the inorganic particulate compound, ammonium nitrate, induced DNA strand breaks at all concentrations, and indications of apoptosis at high concentrations in Raji and HepG2 cells, with ultraviolet radiation preventing apoptosis at high concentrations. We hypothesize that ultraviolet radiation may inhibit an essential cellular mechanism, possibly involving p53, thereby explaining this phenomenon. Further studies are necessary to characterize the roles of apoptosis inhibition induced by DNA damage caused by inorganic particulate matter.",

Three types of tissue, haemolymph, digestive gland were used for assessment of DNA damage. Images of randomly selected cells were analyzed with a fluorescence microscope and image analysis by the Comet Assay IV Image-analysis system. Three parameters, viz. tail length, tail intensity and Olive tail moment were analyzed on 4200 nuclei per cell type. We observed variations in the level of DNA damage in mussels collected at different sites, as well as seasonal variations in response. Sum of ranking differences (SRD) was implemented to compare use of different types of cell and different measure of comet tail per nucleus. Numerical scales were transferred into ranks, range scaling between 0 and 1; standardization and normalization were carried out.SRD selected the best (and worst) combinations: tail moment is the best for all data treatment and for all organs; second best is tail length, and intensity ranks third (except for digestive gland). The differences were significant at the 5% level. Whereas gills and haemolymph cells do not differ significantly, cells of the digestive gland are much more suitable to estimate genotoxicity. Variance analysis decomposed the effect of different factors on the SRD values. This unique combination has provided not only the relative importance of factors, but also an overall evaluation: the best evaluation method, the best data pre-treatment, etc., were chosen even for partially contradictory data.The rank transformation is superior to any other way of scaling, which is proven by ordering the SRD values by SRD again, and by cross validation.",

     "abstract": "The phosphorylated form of the histone protein H2AX, called \u03b3H2AX, is recognized as a useful biomarker not only for DNA double-strand breaks but also for a wide range of other DNA damage. An increasing number of publications propose \u03b3H2AX to be measured when determining genotoxicity, phototoxicity, and the effectiveness of cancer therapy. Because \u03b3H2AX is also generated by apoptosis, a \u03b3H2AX-assay might assess genotoxic risk incorrectly. The aim of this study was to elucidate the influence of apoptosis on measurements of \u03b3H2AX by flow cytometry, with the clastogens mitomycin C (MMC) and etoposide (ETP), and the aneugens vinblastine (VB) and paclitaxel (PT), which do not react directly with DNA. TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells were treated with the clastogens and the aneugens, stained for the apoptotic biomarker caspase-3 and for \u03b3H2AX, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. All the test compounds caused a dose-dependent increase of \u03b3H2AX-positive (\u03b3H2AX+) cells. The \u03b3H2AX+ cell population included both caspase-3-positive (\u03b3H2AX+/caspase-3+) and caspase-3-negative (\u03b3H2AX+/caspase-3\u2212) cells. The increase in \u03b3H2AX+ cells after treatment with the aneugens corresponded to the increase in caspase-3+ cells. The increase in \u03b3H2AX+/caspase-3\u2212 cells after treatment with the clastogens was significant, but there was only a slight increase after treatment with the aneugens. This reflects the fact that the apoptotic pathway of a clastogen starts from DNA damage, whereas that of an aneugen starts from cell-cycle arrest in the M-phase. Therefore, the two pathways contribute differently to apoptosis. Double staining for \u03b3H2AX and caspase-3 provided helpful information for the different mechanistic effects of aneugens and clastogens that induce \u03b3H2AX.",

Frequencies of micronuclei (MN), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB), nuclear buds (NBUD), and apoptotic and necrotic cells in lymphocytes of obese subjects were found to be significantly higher than those found in normal-weight and over-weight subjects (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas plasma concentrations of 8-OHdG in obese subjects were lower than those observed in normal-weight and over-weight subjects (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively).

This aspect was further studied in this paper. Diploid yeast cells were irradiated with gamma rays from 60Co and alpha particles from 239Pu in the stationary phase of cell growth. Survival curves and the kinetics of the liquid-holding recovery were measured. When the irradiated cells had completely recovered from potentially lethal damage, they were again exposed to radiation and allowed post-irradiation recovery. The procedure was repeated three times. By use of a quantitative approach \u2013 describing the process of recovery as a decrease in the effective radiation dose \u2013, the probability of recovery per unit time and the proportion of irreversibly damaged cells were quantitatively estimated. It was shown that the irreversible fraction of cell injury was increased after repeated exposures to gamma rays, from 0.4 after the first irradiation to 0.7 after the third exposure. The effect was more clearly expressed after exposure to densely ionizing radiation, the corresponding values being 0.5 and 1.0. In contrast, the recovery constant did not depend on the number of repeated irradiations and only slightly depended on radiation quality. It is suggested that the process of recovery from potentially lethal radiation damage itself is not impaired after repeated exposures to both low- and high-LET radiations, and the decrease in the ability of the cell to recover from radiation damage is mainly explained by the increase in the proportion of irreversibly damaged cells.",

Curcumin, at relatively high concentrations, was repeatedly reported to be a potent inducer of apoptosis in cancer cells and thus considered a promising anticancer agent. In the present paper, the effects of low concentrations of curcumin on human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells were studied. We found curcumin-mediated decrease in the cell number and viability, and increase in apoptotic events and superoxide level. In contrast to previously shown curcumin cytotoxicity toward different cervical cancer lines, we observed toxic effects when even as low as 1\u00a0\u03bcM concentration of curcumin was used. Curcumin was not genotoxic to HeLa cells. Because argyrophilic nucleolar protein (AgNOR protein) expression is elevated in malignant cells compared to normal cells reflecting the rapidity of cancer cell proliferation, we evaluated curcumin-associated changes in size (area) and number of silver deposits. We showed curcumin-induced decrease in AgNOR protein pools, which may be mediated by global DNA hypermethylation observed after low concentration curcumin treatment. In summary, we have shown for the first time that curcumin at low micromolar range may be effective against HeLa cells, which may have implications for curcumin-based treatment of cervical cancer in humans.",

     "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anthracycline antibiotic against a wide spectrum of tumors and hematological malignancies. It mainly interacts with DNA, but can also generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which damage cell components. Unfortunately, numerous side effects, such as severe cardiotoxicity and bone-marrow suppression, limit its use. To reduce this obstacle and improve its pharmacokinetics, we conjugated DOX to transferrin (TRF), a human plasma protein. In our study, we compared the effect of DOX and the doxorubicin\u2013transferrin conjugate (DOX-TRF) on human leukemic lymphoblasts (CCRF-CEM), and on normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In parallel, experiments were carried out on two human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell lines derived from K562 cells, of which one was sensitive and the other resistant to doxorubicin (K562/DOX). By use of the alkaline comet assay, the effect of the agents on the induction of DNA damage in normal human cells and human leukemia cells was determined. Oxidative and alkylating DNA damage were assayed by a slightly modified comet assay that included the use of the DNA-repair enzymes endonuclease III (Endo III) and formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg). To investigate whether DNA breaks are the result of apoptosis, we examined the induction of DNA fragmentation visualized as oligosomal ladders after simple agarose electrophoresis under neutral conditions. Modifications of the genome induced by the different drugs were analyzed following assessment of the cell-cycle phase.The DOX-TRF conjugate caused more DNA damage than the free drug, the degree of DNA fragmentation being dependent on the duration of treatment and the cell type analyzed. With neutral agarose electrophoresis we showed that the test compounds caused the formation of a characteristic DNA-ladder pattern. Furthermore, the DOX-TRF conjugate generated a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the subG1 fraction and blocked more cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle than did free DOX. In summary, both agents induced DNA damage in cancer cells, but the DOX-TRF conjugate generated more genotoxic effects and apoptosis than the unconjugated drug.",

The results clearly indicate that the genotoxicity of zidovudine (AZT), doxorubicin (DOX) and cyclophosphamide (CP) was significantly increased in the combination treatments (3-AB\u00a0+\u00a0AZT, 3-AB\u00a0+\u00a0DOX, 3-AB\u00a0+\u00a0CP) as compared with the respective controls (treatment with AZT, DOX and CP alone). There was no increase in the genotoxicity per se after treatment with SUC, 3-AB or 3-AB\u00a0+\u00a0SUC, compared with the control (saline). Correlation analysis suggests that all genotoxicity parameters are well correlated with each other. The results clearly show that the genotoxicity of weak genotoxins can be enhanced and detected in the presence of 3-AB in mice. Thus, this approach can be used in the pre-clinical genotoxicity screening of weak genotoxins.",

     "abstract": "We performed an inter-laboratory study to determine the variation of comet assay results and to identify its possible reasons. An exchange of slides between Labs in different stages of the comet assay protocol was performed. Because identical slides, durations of alkali treatment and electrophoresis, and similar electric field strengths (2.0\u00a0V/cm and 2.14\u00a0V/cm) were used, we concluded that the observed inter-laboratory difference in the results is directly associated with the electrophoresis step. In Lab 1, mouse bone marrow cells were exposed to methyl methanesulfonate at concentrations of 10, 25 and 50\u00a0\u03bcM for 3\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. In Lab 2, cells the same as in Lab 1 were immobilized in LMA on slides and exposed to X-rays at doses of 3\u20138\u00a0Gy. We found that the transportation of slides after lysis or electrophoresis step, as well as different dyes used for scoring did not produce any significant effect on the results. No substantial difference in the data was also revealed when various software packages were used for image analysis. The temperature of the alkaline solution was shown to increase during electrophoresis and, besides, the temperature heterogeneity of the solution took place in the area of the platform, with a maximum in the middle of the chamber. The temperature heterogeneity could affect the rate of conversion of alkali labile sites into single stranded breaks. Thus, it was clearly indicated that real temperature variations during the alkali treatment and electrophoresis were an essential factor in the variability of the results between our Labs.",

Although most of the intra-strand crosslinks are removed by the nucleotide excision repair (NER), the remaining crosslinks can cause mutations through the translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) during chromosome replication. To understand the precise mechanism of cisplatin mutagenesis in human cells, the plasmid carrying a single Pt-GG or 1,3-d(GpTpG) crosslink (Pt-GTG) site-specifically in lacZ gene was constructed and propagated in NER-defective xeroderma pigmentosum cells. The plasmids retrieved from the cells were introduced into indicator bacterial cells to access frequencies of TLS and mutations. The experiments revealed that Pt-GTG blocked DNA replication more strongly and caused more mutations (29.1%) than Pt-GG (1.7%). Most mutations were G to A or T base changes at 5\u2032 G residue in the Pt-GTG crosslinks. These results indicate that the Pt-GTG crosslinks become effective obstacles for cancer cell division, and have an important role for cisplatin cancer therapy.",

All except triton X induced binucleated cells in both lines but an increased micronucleus incidence in them was seen only in TK6. The two lines also differed in the numbers of binucleates in the control cultures with 2.0% and 0.5% in TK6 and L5178Y, respectively, and a much higher proportion of those in TK6 contained micronuclei. The differences in behaviour between the two cell lines could not clearly be ascribed to their P53 status. Colchicine induced binucleates in both cell lines but they did not contain increased numbers of micronuclei. The effect on binucleate incidence was not a non-specific cytotoxic response because no increase was seen with triton X even at highly cytotoxic concentrations. The initial concern that not scoring micronuclei in binucleated cells might lead to erroneous results in in vitro micronucleus tests not using a cytokinesis block, was not proven because all the genotoxins tested here induced significant increases in micronucleus frequency in mononuclear cells. When testing less potently active agents in in vitro micronucleus tests not employing a cytokinesis block, care should be taken to understand better this phenomenon and not to include these damaged cells until we do.",

     "abstract": "Trivalent inorganic arsenic (iAs3+) is a powerful carcinogen that enhances the risk of lung cancer. Paradoxically, iAs3+ also shows substantial efficacy in the treatment of lung tumors. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying iAs3+-induced toxicity and therapeutic effect in lung remain unclear. In this study, the effects of iAs3+, sodium arsenite (NaAsO2) and arsenic trioxide (As2O3), on cell viability, apoptosis, genotoxicity and oxidative stress in cultured human bronchial epithelial cells were observed. Our results showed that NaAsO2 and As2O3 exposure could result in defects in cell proliferation and greatly enhance the level of oxidative damage. To clarify the critical role of glutathione (GSH) homeostasis in oxidative damage induced by iAs3+, we further measured the content of GSH, ratio of GSH to GSSG, and the activities of GSH-related enzymes involved in the process of GSH synthesis, recycling and utilization. Our data demonstrated that NaAsO2 and As2O3 disrupted the balance of GSH homeostasis, and NaAsO2- and As2O3-induced oxidative damage was closely associated with the imbalance in GSH synthesis, recycling and utilization. To better understand the physiologic significance of Nrf2 in maintaining GSH-homeostasis, the expression level of Nrf2 was measured after iAs3+ exposure. We found that the protein expression levels of Nrf2 were increased in both NaAsO2- and As2O3-treated cells. Collectively, our findings suggest that disturbed Nrf2-regulated GSH-homeostasis is associated with the oxidative damage triggered by iAs3+, and loss of GSH homeostasis might implicate in both the pathogenesis of iAs3+-induced lung diseases and anticancer activity of iAs3+.",

     "abstract": "Furan is an abundant food and environmental contaminant that is a potent liver carcinogen in rodent models. To determine if furan is genotoxic in vivo, female B6C3F1 Big Blue transgenic mice were treated with 15\u00a0mg/kg bw furan by gavage 5 days a week for 6 weeks, or once weekly for 3 weeks. Liver cII transgene mutation-frequency and mutation spectra were determined. Furan did not increase the mutation frequency under either treatment condition. In the 6-week treatment regimen, there was a change in the cII transgene mutation-spectrum, with the fraction of GC to AT transitions significantly reduced. The only other significant change was an increase in GC to CG transversions; these represented a minor contribution to the overall mutation spectrum. A much larger furan-dependent shift was observed in the 3-week study. There was a significant increase in transversion mutations, predominantly GC to TA transversions as well as smaller non-significant changes in GC to CG and AT to TA transversions. To determine if these mutations were caused by cis-2-butene-1,4-dial (BDA), a reactive metabolite of furan, the mutagenic activity and the mutation spectrum of BDA was determined in vitro, in Big Blue mouse embryonic fibroblasts. This compound did not increase the cII gene mutation-frequency but caused a substantial increase in AT to CG transversions. This increase, however, lost statistical significance when adjusted for multiple comparisons. Together, these findings suggest that BDA may not be directly responsible for the in-vivo effects of furan on mutational spectra. Histopathological analysis of livers from furan-treated mice revealed that furan induced multifocal, hepatocellular necrosis admixed with reactive leukocytes and pigment-laden Kupffer cells, enhanced oval-cell hyperplasia, and increased hepatocyte mitoses, some of which were atypical. An indirect mechanism of genotoxicity is proposed in which chronic toxicity followed by inflammation and secondary cell proliferation triggers cancer development in furan-exposed rodents.",

The study included 43 exposed workers (all males), namely 19 fuel-tanker drivers and 24 filling-station attendants, and 31 male subjects with no occupational exposure to the toxicant (controls). Benzene exposure was verified by means of environmental monitoring with passive personal samplers (Radiello\u00ae), and through biological monitoring, i.e. by measurement of urinary trans,trans-muconic acid, S-phenylmercapturic acid and benzene. The frequency of CA and MN in peripheral lymphocytes was determined according to standard procedures. Exposure to benzene was found to be significantly higher for fuel-tanker drivers (median 246.6\u00a0\u03bcg/m3) than for filling-station attendants (median 19.9\u00a0\u03bcg/m3). Both groups had significantly higher exposure than controls (median 4.3\u00a0\u03bcg/m3). No increased frequency of CA and MN was observed in either fuel-tanker drivers or filling-station attendants compared with controls. In all subjects examined as a single group, the frequency of MN was significantly dependent on age. Only in the fuel-tanker drivers was the frequency of MN found to depend not only on age, but also on exposure to benzene. In conclusion, the frequency of MN, but not of CA, could be influenced by exposure to benzene concentrations of up to one order of magnitude lower than the threshold limit value (time-weighted average).",

Genotoxicity and mutagenicity assays can be used to evaluate the effects of these pollutants. We have evaluated genotoxicity and mutagenicity in workers occupationally exposed to xenobiotics, by application of the 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), comet, and micronucleus (MN) assays. Biomarkers of benzene and carbon monoxyde exposure were also measured: urinary t,t-muconic acid (t,t-MA) and carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) in whole blood, respectively. The study groups comprised 43 gas station attendants (GSA), 34 taxi drivers (TD), and 22 persons without known occupational exposures (NE). Levels of t,t-MA in the GSA group were significantly elevated compared to the NE group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), however these levels were below of levels established by ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists). COHb levels were not significantly different between the TD and NE groups (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). DNA damage index (DI) and 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher for both the GSA and TD groups, compared to the NE group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but MN frequencies were not elevated. Spearman correlation analysis showed that the frequency of MN was positively correlated with 8-OHdG. A positive correlation between DNA DI levels and 8-OHdG was also observed.

Recently it was reported that the commercially available Montmorillonite clay, Cloisite\u00ae 30B, which is surface-modified by organic quaternary ammonium compounds, was genotoxic in vitro. In the present study the in-vivo genotoxic and inflammatory potential of Cloisite\u00ae 30B was investigated as a follow-up of the in-vitro studies. Wistar rats were exposed to Cloisite\u00ae 30B twice 24\u00a0h apart by oral gavage, at doses ranging from 250 to 1000\u00a0mg/kg body weight [indicate duration of treatment; Ed.]. There was no induction of DNA strand-breaks in colon, liver and kidney cells and there was no increase in inflammatory cytokine markers in blood-plasma samples. In order to verify the possible absorption of Cloisite\u00ae 30B from the gastrointestinal tract, inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis was performed on samples of liver, kidney and faeces, with aluminium as a tracer element characteristic to clay. The results showed that aluminium could be detected in faeces, but not in the liver or kidneys. This indicated that there was no systemic exposure to clay particles from Cloisite\u00ae 30B. Detection and identification of free quaternary ammonium modifier in the highest dose of Cloisite\u00ae 30B was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS). This analysis revealed a mixture of three quaternary ammonium analogues. The detected concentration of the organomodifier corresponded to an exposure of rats to about 5\u00a0mg quaternary ammonium analogues/kg body weight.",

A Siemens Mevatron MD2 (Siemens AG, USA, 1994) linear accelerator was used for the irradiation with 1 or 2\u00a0Gy. Treatment of the lymphocytes with cinnamic acid prior to irradiation reduced the number of micronuclei when compared with that in control samples. Treatment with cinnamic acid without irradiation did not increase the number of micronuclei and did not show a cytostatic effect in the lymphocytes. The results of the alkaline comet assay revealed that cinnamic acid reduces the DNA damage induced by X-rays, showing a significant radio-protective effect. Cinnamic acid decreased the frequency of irradiation-induced micronuclei by 16\u201355% and reduced DNA breakage by 17\u201350%, as determined by the alkaline comet assay. Cinnamic acid may thus act as a radio-protective compound, and future studies may focus on elucidating the mechanism by which cinnamic acid offers radioprotection.",

In P. almogravensis, a total of 257 and 258 bands in roots and 255 and 265 bands in leaves were produced in the presence and absence of Al, respectively. In P. lagopus were produced 279 and 278 a total bands in roots and 275 and 274 bands in leaves, under the same conditions. The changes in ISSR profiles after Al treatment were considered as gain and/or loss of bands compared with the controls. The results suggest that changes in genomic template stability (GTS) could be detected with ISSR profiles. This molecular marker proved to be a good tool to detect the effects of Al on DNA profiles. It seems that Al did not interfere significantly with DNA integrity in both species but generated less ISSR stability in P. almogravensis than in P. lagopus. The results confirm the tolerance of P. almogravensis and suggest the same behavior of P. lagopus. Although further studies are required for confirmation the Al tolerance behavior of P. lagopus, a potential application for phytoremediation can be also considered due its wide distribution.",

     "abstract": "The in vivo comet assay has been used for the evaluation of DNA damage and repair in various tissues of rodents. However, it can give false-positive results due to non-specific DNA damage associated with cell death. In this study, we examined whether the in vivo comet assay can distinguish between genotoxic and non-genotoxic DNA damage in urinary bladder cells, by using the following seven chemicals related to urinary bladder carcinogenesis in rodents: N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN), glycidol, 2,2-bis(bromomethyl)-1,3-propanediol (BMP), 2-nitroanisole (2-NA), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), uracil, and melamine. BBN, glycidol, BMP, and 2-NA are known to be Ames test-positive and they are expected to produce DNA damage in the absence of cytotoxicity. BITC, uracil, and melamine are Ames test-negative with metabolic activation but have the potential to induce non-specific DNA damage due to cytotoxicity. The test chemicals were administered orally to male Sprague-Dawley rats (five per group) for each of two consecutive days. Urinary bladders were sampled 3\u00a0h after the second administration and urothelial cells were analyzed by the comet assay and subjected to histopathological examination to evaluate cytotoxicity. In the urinary bladders of rats treated with BBN, glycidol, and BMP, DNA damage was detected. In contrast, 2-NA induced neither DNA damage nor cytotoxicity. The non-genotoxic chemicals (BITC, uracil, and melamine) did not induce DNA damage in the urinary bladders under conditions where some histopathological changes were observed. The results indicate that the comet assay could distinguish between genotoxic and non-genotoxic chemicals and that no false-positive responses were obtained.",

We investigated the changes in some circulating blood-cell parameters of tadpoles of the common toad (Rhinella arenarum) that were exposed during 48 or 96\u00a0h to three sub-lethal concentrations (3.75, 7.5, and 15\u00a0mg/L) of a commercial formulation of a glufosinate-ammonium (GLA)-based herbicide (Liberty\u00ae, LY\u00ae) as well as to the corresponding active ingredient GLA. The frequency of ME and other erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities (ENA, i.e., lobed nuclei, binucleates or segmented nuclei, kidney-shaped nuclei, notched nuclei, and picnotic nuclei) were evaluated and compared with positive (cyclophosphamide, CP, 40\u00a0mg/L) and negative (de-chlorinated tap water) controls. The results indicate that the exposure of R. arenarum tadpoles to LY\u00ae induces a concentration-dependent increase in ME frequency. The ENA frequency at 48\u00a0h was also significantly higher than that in the negative control group for all the chemicals assayed (CP, LY\u00ae and GLA) whereas at 96\u00a0h, increases in ENA over the negative control group were found only for CP and GLA (7.5\u00a0mg/L). Our study demonstrates that the commercial formulation of a GLA-based herbicide induces micronucleus formation in R. arenarum tadpoles, in contrast to the active ingredient. According to these results, the inert ingredients of the commercial formulation played an important role in the production of genotoxic damage in erythrocytes of amphibian tadpoles.",

In dogs, in addition to smoke inhalation and transdermic absorption, exposure to smoke includes oral ingestion of particles adhered to the animal's fur. This study evaluates the presence and type of histological alterations and DNA integrity in oropharyngeal tissue in dogs exposed and non-exposed to household cigarette smoke by means of histopathology and comet assay studies on biopsy and swab samples. A non-probabilistic convenience sample of 12 dogs were selected and classified in two groups: exposed and non-exposed to cigarette smoke. Non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was carried out on biopsy and swab data and a Chi2 test was performed on the information obtained by histopathology. A significance level was set at P\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Statistically significant differences were found between groups in comet assays carried out on biopsy samples. No differences (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) were found between groups based on comet assays swab samples and histopathology assessment. In conclusion, exposure to cigarette smoke causes DNA damage in dog oropharyngeal tissue.

     "abstract": "To date there are no widely accepted methods for the toxicological testing of complex gaseous mixtures and aerosols, such as cigarette smoke, although some modifications to the standard regulatory methods have been developed and used. Historically, routine testing of cigarettes has primarily focused on the particulate fraction of cigarette smoke. However, this fraction may not accurately reflect the full toxicity and mutagenicity of the smoke aerosol as a whole, which contains semi-volatiles and short-lived products of combustion. In this study we have used a modified version of the bacterial reverse-mutation (Ames) assay for the testing of mainstream smoke generated from 3R4F reference cigarettes with a Vitrocell\u00ae VC 10 exposure system. This method has been evaluated in four strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA98, TA100, YG1024 and YG1042) and one strain of Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA pKM101) in the absence and presence of a metabolic activation system. Following exposure at four concentrations of diluted mainstream cigarette-smoke, concentration-related and reproducible increases in the number of revertants were observed in all four Salmonella strains. E. coli strain WP2 uvrA pKM101 was unresponsive at the four concentrations tested. To quantify the exposure dose and to enable biological response to be plotted as a function of deposited mass, quartz-crystal microbalances were included in situ in the smoke-exposure set-up. This methodology was further assessed by comparing the responses of strain YG1042 to mainstream cigarette-smoke on a second VC 10 Smoking Robot. In summary, the Ames assay can be successfully modified to assess the toxicological impact of mainstream cigarette-smoke.",

Recent research has shown that BPA can influence the function of pancreatic islets. In this study, our aim is to assess the DNA damage induced by BPA and to clarify the mechanism, by use of rat insulinoma INS-1 cells. INS-1 cells were exposed to different doses of BPA (0, 25, 50, 100\u00a0\u03bcM). We conducted the single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay to measure DNA damage, and studied proteins such as p53 and p-Chk2 (T68) by Western blotting, in order to verify the (geno)toxicity of BPA. Moreover, we examined intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) to discuss the possible mechanism of DNA damage. The results show that BPA caused an increased in DNA strand-breaks along with greater DNA migration from the nucleus into the comet tail. The expression of DNA damage-associated proteins (p53 and p-Chk2 (T68)) was significantly increased. The exposure to various doses of BPA caused a significant increase in intracellular ROS and a significant reduction in the level of GSH. N-Acetyl cysteine, an inhibitor of intracellular ROS formation, can significantly reduce the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen.",

It was previously reduced to 1\u00a0mM or 0.5\u00a0mg/mL in the International Conference of Harmonization (ICH) S2 (R1) guideline for pharmaceuticals. Reduction of the top-concentration limit is expected to reduce the number of false or misleading positives. However, this reduction may affect the sensitivity or specificity to predict rodent carcinogenicity. Thus, the effect of a reduction in the top-concentration limit on sensitivity and specificity was investigated by use of a dataset on 435 chemicals obtained from the \u2018Carcinogenicity and Genotoxicity eXperience\u2019 (CGX) database (267 CA-positives and 168 CA-negatives; 317 carcinogens and 118 non-carcinogens) where three TGs (i.e., 1997-OECD, r-OECD and ICH) were applied. The application of the r-OECD TG did not affect the sensitivity (63.1%) or specificity (59.3%) against carcinogenicity, compared with the 1997-OECD TG (sensitivity 63.1%, specificity 59.3%). However, the application of the ICH TG had certain effects, i.e., a decrease in sensitivity (45.4%) and an increase in specificity (72.9%). A change in the number of CA-positives by the application of each TG was also investigated by use of 124 CA-positives from the Japanese Existing Chemical (JEC) database. The application of r-OECD TG showed a small reduction in CA-positives, but the ICH TG reduced this number by approximately half. More than half of the CA-positives had a molecular weight <200. These results suggest that the r-OECD TG will not affect the sensitivity or specificity for the detection of rodent carcinogens, indicating the usefulness of the guideline. However, nearly no improvement with respect to a reduction in the number of false positives should be expected.",

Using Western blotting, we investigated the expression of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), the most efficient cytosolic enzyme that reductively activates aristolochic acid I (AAI) in mice and rats. In addition, the effect of AAI on the expression of the NQO1 protein and its enzymatic activity in these experimental animal models was examined.We found that NQO1 protein levels in cytosolic fractions isolated from liver, kidney and lung of mice differed from those expressed in these organs of rats. In mice, the highest levels of NQO1 protein and NQO1 activity were found in the kidney, followed by lung and liver. In contrast, the NQO1 protein levels and enzyme activity were lowest in rat-kidney cytosol, whereas the highest amounts of NQO1 protein and activity were found in lung cytosols, followed by those of liver.NQO1 protein and enzyme activity were induced in liver and kidney of AAI-pretreated mice compared with those of untreated mice. NQO1 protein and enzyme activity were also induced in rat kidney by AAI. Furthermore, the increase in hepatic and renal NQO1 enzyme activity was associated with AAI bio-activation and elevated AAI-DNA adduct levels were found in ex vivo incubations of cytosolic fractions with DNA and AAI. In conclusion, our results indicate that AAI can increase its own metabolic activation by inducing NQO1, thereby enhancing its own genotoxic potential.",

However, standard methods for genotoxicity assessment may not be adequate for NPs; altered tests reported here have been developed to address perceived inadequacies. The bacterial reverse mutation assay is an essential part of the battery of tests to determine genotoxicity. The utility of this test for assessing NPs is currently questioned, due to negative results seemingly caused by failure of particle uptake. To probe uptake issues, we examined the physical state in different media, dose and time dependent association, uptake and mutagenicity of titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs in Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. The NPs suspended in water were characterized using dynamic light scattering, NP tracking analysis and transmission electron microscopy. NP association with bacteria was assessed by flow cytometry. Association was found to be time and dose dependent, with maximal association by 60\u00a0min. Therefore mutagenicity was assessed after a 60\u00a0min pre-incubation in a miniaturized assay demonstrating enhanced sensitivity. To assess potential indirect effects on bacterial mutagenicity, the effect of TiO2 NPs on the action of standard mutagens or on DNA repair capability was also investigated. TiO2 NPs did not affect mutant yields in standard strains of S. typhimurium or E. coli, including those detecting oxidative damage, using the modified methods. Nor did TiO2 NPs affect the action of standard mutagens or DNA excision repair capability. Despite particle association with the bacteria, subsequent analysis using electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy indicated that the NPs were not internalized. This work demonstrates that additional studies, including flow cytometry, are valuable tools for understanding the action of NPs in biological systems.",

However, the dynamic response to soil mutagens under conditions of long-term exposure has been studied insufficiently. The clonal nature of Tradescantia #4430 and the well-developed associated test systems for evaluation of genotoxicity allow investigation of the permanent effects of direct exposure to the soil not only on plants of the same genotype, but even with the same individual plants, as was done in the present study. Twenty soil samples of different origin were studied in Tradescantia after 0.5, 1 and 2 years of direct exposure to the soil, in order to examine the induction of pink cells (PC), colorless cells (CC) and branched hairs (BH). Additionally, after 0.5 years, micronucleus (MN) formation was assessed, and after 1 year, the variation of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers was evaluated. Nine soil samples were of urban origin, and the others came from different soils from former military grounds. The results of the 0.5-year exposure were compared with the effects of aqueous/DMSO extracts tested in previous work. The long-term exposure period allowed not only a better differentiation of the soils within territories, but also permitted detection of differences between soils of urban and military origin. The results also depended on the test used to evaluate genotoxicity. The \u2018burst\u2019 phenomenon, consisting of a sudden increase of BH variation and, especially, of CC, was observed only in tests of samples from several military sites, mainly after a 2-year exposure. MN formation was less frequent after 0.5 years of exposure compared with the results from aqueous extracts, and this difference was highly significant. The variation of the RAPD markers in a significant portion of the soil samples coincided with a higher level of variation according to other tests (PC, CC, BH), but predicting the genotoxicity of the soils based on their elemental soil composition at the end of the experiment was impossible. At several points where a \u2018burst\u2019 was observed, the concentration of a number of elements was lower. A cumulative effect is hypothesized to explain these observations. Tradescantia clone #4430 is the most suitable system for such studies.",

     "abstract": "Double-strand breaks (DSBs) may result from endogenous (e.g., reactive oxygen species, variable (diversity) joining, meiotic exchanges, collapsed replication forks, nucleases) or exogenous (e.g., ionizing radiation, chemotherapeutic agents, radiomimetic compounds) events. DSBs disrupt the integrity of DNA and failed or improper DSBs repair may lead to genomic instability and, eventually, mutations, cancer, or cell death. Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the major pathway used by higher eukaryotic cells to repair these lesions. Given the complexity of NHEJ and the number of proteins and cofactors involved, secondary metabolites from medicinal or food plants might interfere with the process, activating or inhibiting repair. Twelve natural products, arbutin, curcumin, indole-3-carbinol, and nine flavonoids (apigenin, baicalein, chalcone, epicatechin, genistein, myricetin, naringenin, quercetin, sakuranetin) were chosen for their postulated roles in cancer chemoprevention and/or treatment. The effects of these compounds on NHEJ were investigated with an in vitro protocol based on plasmid substrates. Plasmids were linearized by a restriction enzyme, generating cohesive ends, or by a combination of enzymes, generating incompatible ends; plasmids were then incubated with a nuclear extract prepared from normal human small-intestinal cells (FHS 74 Int), either treated with these natural products or untreated (controls). The NHEJ repair complex from nuclear extracts ligates linearized plasmids, resulting in plasmid oligomers that can be separated and quantified by on-chip microelectrophoresis. Some compounds (chalcone, epicatechin, myricetin, sakuranetin and arbutin) clearly activated NHEJ, whereas others (apigenin, baicalein and curcumin) significantly reduced the repair rate of both types of plasmid substrates. Although this in vitro protocol is only partly representative of the in vivo situation, the natural products appear to interfere with NHEJ repair and warrant further investigation.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the difference of susceptibility of methylation induced by carcinogens between p16ink4a and p19arf. The methylation status of both genes was analyzed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and bisulfite-sequencing, respectively. The expression level of P16 protein was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Results showed that p16ink4a methylation was detected in the glandular stomach, small intestine and other organs of mice following X-radiation and subsequent bone marrow transplantation (BMT), but not in mock control mice. We found that the intestinal tract was the most sensitive organ for X-ray induced p16ink4a methylation. Loss of P16 protein expression was observed in the intestinal tissues of X-irradiated mice, but not in the mock control mice. Interestingly, p19arf methylation was not observed in the gastrointestinal tissues of the negative control mice following X-radiation/BMT. However, administration of N-nitrosomethylurea and/or Helicobacter felis infection promoted methylation of p19arf CpG islands in the gastrointestinal tracts, but did not promote p16ink4a methylation. In addition, p16ink4a methylation was detected not only in the X-irradiated GFP-negative tissue cells, but also in the GFP-positive bone marrow-derived cells that were transplanted into the BMT mice after X-radiation. In conclusion, the methylation susceptibility of p16ink4a and p19arf to carcinogen treatments was remarkably different: X-radiation indirectly induces systemic p16ink4a methylation, especially in the intestine; whereas N-nitrosomethylurea and/or H. felis infection induce p19arf methylation in their target organs.",

In vivo, patients treated with Candesartan, Telmisartan and Valsartan showed a statistical significant increase in these parameters, while Olmesartan showed the highest effect in vitro. We also found that the drugs inhibit the NDI in vitro and that Eprosartan, Olmesartan and Telmisartan are the ARBs studied with the highest effect in decreasing the proliferation of the cells. FISH analysis revealed no significant difference between patients and controls in the frequency of centromeric signals. A slight variability, without statistical significance, in the frequency of micronuclei with a centromere signal (CN+MN) was found among the different ARBs analyzed, ruling out an aneugenic potential. When accounting for risk factors, we found that in patients there is a positive correlation between MN, BNMN and sex and a negative correlation with duration of treatment.",

This study assessed the cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and protective effects of oenothein B using in vitro SOS-Inductest and in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus (MN) assay through oral and intraperitonial routes. In both assays oenothein B did not produce genotoxic effects in any of doses tested; in contrast, cytotoxic effect in cells was detected only in mice groups treated by both routes and exposed for 24 and 48\u00a0h. Antigenotoxic and anticytotoxic activities of oenothein B were evaluated using both assays in combination with mitomycin C (MMC), a bioreductive alkylating agent. In the MN assay, a significant reduction was observed in MN frequency in all groups co-treated with MMC and OeB compared to those which received only MMC. Anticytotoxicity was observed in mice groups exposed to OeB and MMC for 24 and 48\u00a0h. In the SOS-Inductest, oenothein B failed to show antigenotoxic and anticytotoxic effects; thus, it undoubtedly showed an in vivo protective activity against primary DNA damage induced by mitomycin C.",

In the present study the effect of apigenin was investigated with respect to hepatotoxicity induced by N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), a compound that is present in many food stuffs and has been reported to be a hepatocarcinogen. Male rats were exposed to NDEA (0.1\u00a0mg/ml) dissolved in drinking-water separately, and with 10, 20, or 40\u00a0mg/ml of apigenin for 21 days. The activity of glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was measured in blood serum. Lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl content and micronucleus frequency were determined in hepatocytes. To assess the effect on DNA damage, the comet assay was performed on hepatocytes, blood lymphocytes and bone-marrow cells of the exposed rats. The results of the study reveal that the treatment of NDEA together with apigenin showed a significant dose-dependent decrease in the serum concentration of the enzymes SGOT, SGPT, ALP and LDH (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Histological sections of the liver also showed a protective effect of apigenin.

These studies suggested that the use of a human cell type with functional p53 and a toxicity measure that included a function of cell proliferation could dramatically reduce the detection of misleading positive results.A reduced \u201cfalse positive rate\u201d should not be at the expense of a loss of sensitivity of the assay. Therefore, we have investigated the sensitivity of the MNvit assay to known genotoxic agents using three cell types shown previously to be less prone to misleading positives, namely human lymphocytes (HuLy), TK6 and HepG2 cells. The 17 chemicals are well characterised and are from a list of chemicals known to produce positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays.These data demonstrated a high sensitivity of the assay in which TK6 and HuLy cells were employed, such that 15 out of the 17 chemicals were correctly identified. By contrast, the use of HepG2 cells resulted in far fewer than expected positive responses.In conclusion, using TK6 and HuLy cells in preference to long established rodent cell lines in order to improve specificity does not compromise the sensitivity of the MNvit to detect known genotoxic agents.",

Earlier reports from our laboratory and others have indicated that fisetin has both aneugenic and clastogenic properties in cultured cells. More recently, fisetin has also been reported to target Aurora B kinase, a Ser/Thr kinase involved in ensuring proper microtubule attachment at the spindle assembly checkpoint, and an enzyme that is overexpressed in several types of cancer. Here we have further characterized the chromosome damage caused by fisetin and compared it with that induced by two known Aurora kinase inhibitors, VX-680 and ZM-447439, in cultured TK6 cells using the micronucleus assay with CREST staining as well as a flow cytometry-based assay that measures multiple types of numerical chromosomal aberrations. The three compounds were highly effective in inducing aneuploidy and polyploidy as evidenced by increases in kinetochore-positive micronuclei, hyperdiploidy, and polyploidy. With fisetin, however, the latter two effects were most significantly observed only after cells were allowed to overcome a cell cycle delay, and occurred at higher concentrations than those induced by the other Aurora kinase inhibitors. Modest increases in kinetochore-negative micronuclei were also seen with the model Aurora kinase inhibitors. These results indicate that fisetin induces multiple types of chromosome abnormalities in human cells, and indicate a need for a thorough investigation of fisetin-augmented dietary supplements.",

RES, a polyphenolic compound, has attracted considerable attention because of its antioxidant and antimutagenic effects. DXR, a chemotherapeutic agent, is known to cause chromosomal aberrations in healthy cells in cancer patients. In this study, Wistar albino male rats were divided into 6 groups with 6 animals each. The control group received distilled water i.p. and the DXR group received an i.p. injection of doxorubicin (90\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw). For the 2 RES dose groups (12.5 and 25\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw, respectively), RES was injected i.p. 5 times during the 24\u00a0h study period to coincide with the schedule for the DXR\u00a0+\u00a0RES groups. The DXR-RES groups received DXR (90\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw) and RES at either 12.5 or 25\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw, i.p. 30\u00a0min before, concurrently, and then every 6\u00a0h after DXR administration. Bone marrow collection was timed to coincide with 24\u00a0h after DXR administration in all groups. RES administration alone did not induce any significant increase in frequency of chromosome aberrations or abnormal metaphases compared with controls (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) while DXR alone did (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In the DXR-RES 12.5\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw group, frequency of chromosome aberrations and abnormal metaphases were slightly reduced compared to DXR alone, but this was not statistically significant.

The aim of this study was to analyze the influence of age, sex, and nest of origin on spontaneous genetic damage of Tupinambis merianae determined by the comet assay (CA) and the micronucleus (MN) test, in order to improve reference data for future in vivo studies of xenobiotics exposure in this species. Sixty-five tegu lizards of three different ages: newborns (NB), juveniles (JUV) and adults (AD), both sexes and from different nests of origin were used. Blood samples were collected from the caudal vein of all animals and the MN test and CA were applied on peripheral blood erythrocytes to determine basal frequency of MN (BFMN) and basal damage index (BDI). The comparison between age groups showed statistically significant differences in the BFMN and BDI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). NB animals showed significantly higher BDI values in relation to JUV and AD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.016), but no statistically differences were found between the latter two. NB showed lower BFMN respect to other age groups, being statistically significant only when compared to AD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.016). BFMN or BDI showed no statistically significant differences between sexes or nests of origin (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). A weak negative relationship was found only between BFMN and weight of NB tegu lizard (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014; R2\u00a0=\u00a00.245). Basal values of genetic damage obtained with both biomarkers in the tegu lizard evidenced that age is an intrinsic factor that should be taken into account to avoid misunderstanding of the results in future biomonitoring studies.",

For that purpose, expression of genes encoding for metallothionein (MT), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), P-gp, catalase, glutathione S-transferase and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) proteins have been measured using RT-qPCR. Data reported here show that Cd is a strong inducer of MT and HSP70 genes, and that BaP is a strong inducer of P-gp and AHR genes. Exposure to Cd and BaP resulted in moderate changes in antioxidant enzymes mRNA. Since the increase of MT mRNA occurred when the DNA SB level returned to its basal level, we can suggest that MT is implicated in cadmium detoxification.",

Dose- and time-dependent genotoxic effects of AA were investigated in Swiss albino mice after exposure via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection, by employing assays to detect chromosomal aberrations (CA) and micronuclei (MN) in bone marrow, MN in fetal liver, and abnormalities in sperm. Animals were treated with single doses of 50, 100 and 150\u00a0mg/kg body weight (bw), and with daily doses of 50\u00a0mg/kg bw for seven consecutive days, in order to study the effects of acute and cumulative doses, respectively. Post-treatment sampling was done at 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h for bone-marrow CA and MN tests, to study time-dependent effects. Both single and repeated exposures of AA induced chromosomal aberrations, which were dose and time-dependent. The MN test failed to demonstrate genotoxicity after the single-dose exposures, indicating that a higher threshold dose is required for MN induction. Repeated treatment of AA, however, induced MN formation even at the low dose (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), reflecting genotoxicity following chronic/sub-chronic exposure. A significant reduction in mitotic index and in the P/N (polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocytes) ratio suggests that AA also has a mitodepressive effect in bone-marrow cells. AA-induced germinal genotoxicity was evident from a significant and dose-dependent increase in the percentage of abnormal spermatozoa and a reduction in sperm count. Transplacental exposure of AA resulted in the dose-dependent increase in the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes in the developing fetus. Thus, the current in vivo study revealed genotoxic effects of AA both on somatic and germ cells of Swiss albino mice.",

It interacts synergistically with Hepatitis B or C virus (HBV, HBC) infection, thereby increasing the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The G to T transversion at the third position of codon 249 (AGG) of the TP53 gene, substituting arginine to serine, is the most common aflatoxin-induced mutation linked to HCC. This study examined mutations in TP53 by PCR-RFLP analysis and by measurement of an aflatoxin-albumin adduct as a biomarker for human exposure of aflatoxin B1 by indirect-competitive ELISA, in samples collected from healthy controls as well as patients with hepatitis in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India. A total of 238 blood samples were analyzed the presence of the G to T mutation. Eighteen of these samples were from HBV-positive subjects, 112 of these were from subjects who had HBV-induced liver cirrhosis, and 108 samples were taken from subjects without HBV infection or liver cirrhosis (control group). The G to T mutation was detected in 10 samples, 8 of which were from subjects positive to both HBV and aflatoxin-albumin adduct in blood (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07); whilst two were from individuals who were HBV-negative, but positive for the aflatoxin-albumin adduct (p\u00a0=\u00a00.14). The aflatoxin-albumin adduct was detected in 37 of 238 samples, 29 samples were from HBV-positive subjects and eight were from individuals who were positive for both HBV and the TP53 mutation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). The concentration of aflatoxin-albumin adduct ranged from 2.5 to 667\u00a0pg/mg albumin. Despite low incidence of the G to T mutation, its detection in subjects positive to aflatoxin-adducts is indicative of a strong association between the mutation and aflatoxin exposure in India.",

In this study we examine whether the damage other than double-strand breaks (non-DSB damage), which is UV-A-induced oxidative damage, plays a role in the induction of chromosomal instability. We exposed human chromosome 21 to UV-A and transferred the chromosome into non-irradiated mouse recipient cells by microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. The chromosomal instability of both the transferred human chromosome and the recipient mouse chromosomes was examined by whole-chromosome painting and fluorescence in situ hybridization (WCP-FISH). The ploidy of the mouse recipient cells increased, and chromosomal aberrations occurred not only in the UV-A-irradiated human chromosome but also in the non-irradiated mouse chromosomes. The frequencies of these abnormalities increased with the radiation dose received by the transferred human chromosome. In contrast, in the control experiment, in which an non-irradiated human chromosome was transferred, the micro-cell hybrids remained diploid, and the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in both the transferred human chromosome and recipient mouse chromosomes remained low. Thus, the present study indicates that a chromosome harboring non-DSB damage induced by UV-A irradiation is unstable and transmits instability to chromosomes of non-irradiated recipient mouse cells.",

In contrast, significant DNA damage was observed in the post-replication repair mutants after their exposure to 1.5 and 15\u00a0ng/ml DDVP. The pre-replication repair mutant mus207 showed maximum sensitivity to DDVP, suggestive of alkylation damage to DNA.

Furthermore, epigenetic perturbations have been associated with exposure to a range of drugs and toxicants, including non-genotoxic carcinogens (NGCs). Although a variety of epigenetic modifications induced by NGCs have been studied previously, recent genome-wide integrated epigenomic and transcriptomic studies reveal for the first time the extent and dynamic nature of the epigenetic perturbations resulting from xenobiotic exposure.

The epigenetic marks induce alterations to the gene expression profile, which, in addition to mediating homeostatic responses, have the potential to promote an abnormal physiology either immediately or at a later stage of development, for example leading to an adult onset of disease. Although this has been well established, epigenetic mechanisms are not considered in chemical risk assessment or utilised in the monitoring of the exposure and effects of chemicals and environmental change. In this review, epigenetic factors, specifically DNA methylation, are highlighted as mechanisms of adaptation and response to environmental factors and which, if persistent, have the potential, retrospectively, to reflect previous stress exposures. Thus, it is proposed that epigenetic \u201cfoot-printing\u201d of organisms could identify classes of chemical contaminants to which they have been exposed throughout their lifetime. In some cases, the potential for persistent transgenerational modification of the epigenome may also inform on parental germ cell exposures. It is recommended that epigenetic mechanisms, alongside genetic mechanisms, should eventually be considered in environmental toxicity safety assessments and in biomonitoring studies. This will assist in determining the mode of action of toxicants, no observed adverse effect level and identification of biomarkers of toxicity for early detection and risk assessment in toxicology but there are critical areas that remain to be explored before this can be achieved.",

     "abstract": "5-Methylcytosine and methylated histones have been considered for a long time as stable epigenetic marks of chromatin involved in gene regulation. This concept has been recently revisited with the detection of large amounts of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, now considered as the sixth DNA base, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Purkinje neurons and brain tissues. The dioxygenases that belong to the ten eleven translocation (TET) oxygenase family have been shown to initiate the formation of this methyl oxidation product of 5-methylcytosine that is also generated although far less efficiently by radical reactions involving hydroxyl radical and one-electron oxidants. It was found as additional striking data that iterative TET-mediated oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine gives rise to 5-formylcytosine and 5-carboxylcytosine. This survey focuses on chemical and biochemical aspects of the enzymatic oxidation reactions of 5-methylcytosine that are likely to be involved in active demethylation pathways through the implication of enzymatic deamination of 5-methylcytosine oxidation products and/or several base excision repair enzymes. The high biological relevance of the latter modified bases explains why major efforts have been devoted to the design of a broad range of assays aimed at measuring globally or at the single base resolution, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine and the two other oxidation products in the DNA of cells and tissues. Another critical issue that is addressed in this review article deals with the assessment of the possible role of 5-methylcytosine oxidation products, when present in elevated amounts in cellular DNA, in terms of mutagenesis and interference with key cellular enzymes including DNA and RNA polymerases.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetics can play a role in interactions between chemicals and exposed species, between species and abiotic ecosystem components or between species of the same or another population in a community. Technological progress and advanced insights into epigenetic processes have led to the description of epigenetic features (mainly DNA methylation) in many ecologically relevant species: algae, plants, several invertebrates and fish. Epigenetic changes in plants, insects and cladocerans have been reported to be induced by various environmental stress factors including nutrition or water deficiency, grazing, light or temperature alterations, social environment, and dissolved organic matter concentrations. As regards chemicals, studies in rats and mice exposed to specific pesticides, hydrocarbons, dioxins, and endocrine disrupting chemicals demonstrated the induction of epigenetic changes, suggesting the need for further research with these substances in an ecotoxicological context. In fish and plants, exposure to polyaromatic hydrocarbons, metals, and soluble fractions of solid waste affected the epigenetic status. A novel concept in ecotoxicological epigenetics is the induction of transgenerational stress resistance upon chemical exposure, as demonstrated in rice exposed to metals. Evaluating epigenetics in ecotoxicological field studies is a second relatively new approach. A cryptic lineage of earthworms had developed arsenic tolerance in the field, concurrent with specific DNA methylation patterns. Flatfish caught in the framework of environmental monitoring had developed tumours, exhibiting specific DNA methylation patterns. Two main potential implications of epigenetics in an ecotoxicological context are (1) the possibility of transgenerationally inherited, chemical stress-induced epigenetic changes with associated phenotypes and (2) epigenetically induced adaptation to stress upon long-term chemical exposure. Key knowledge gaps are concerned with the causality of the relation between epigenetic and phenotypic changes, the persistence of transgenerational effects, the implications at population level and the costs of tolerance. Epigenetic changes following exposure to multiple stressors constitute another promising area of further research.",

     "abstract": "The oxidatively modified DNA base 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) is nontoxic and weakly mutagenic. Here we report on new data suggesting a potential for 8-oxoGua to affect the expression of several genes via epigenetic changes resulting in chromatin relaxation. Using pig thymus extract, we analyzed the distribution of 8-oxoGua among different nuclei fractions representative of transcriptionally active and silenced regions. The levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) found in transcriptionally active euchromatin (4.37/106 nucleotides) and in the matrix fraction (4.16/106 nucleotides) were about 5 times higher than in transcriptionally silenced heterochromatin (0.91/106 nucleotides). Other experimental data are presented which suggest that 8-oxoGua present in specific DNA sequences may be widely used for transcription regulation.Like 8-oxoGua, 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5-hmUra) is another oxidatively modified DNA base (the derivative is formed by thymine oxidation). Recent experimental evidence supports the notion that 5-hmUra plays an important role in active DNA demethylation. This involves overexpression of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and ten-eleven translocation 1 (TET1) protein (the key proteins involved in active demethylation), which leads to global accumulation of 5-hmUra. Our preliminary data demonstrate a significant increase of the 5-hmUra levels in pig brain extract when compared with liver extract. The lack of 5-hmUra in Escherichia coli DNA also speaks for a role of this modification in the active demethylation process. It is concluded that 8-oxodG and 5-hmUra in DNA may be considered as epigenetic marks.",

     "abstract": "Interactions of living organisms with their environment mainly involve modulation of gene expression by stimulation or silencing. One of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate translation and the levels of transcripts is RNA interference, in which microRNAs (miRNAs) address RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) to degrade specific mRNAs or to silence their translation. In this mechanism, double stranded RNA structure is crucial for miRNA biogenesis and the action of RISCs. RNA molecules can be modified structurally by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) that are produced in cells of all aerobic organisms and may be induced by environmental factors.Here we describe experiments in which changes of ROS and transcript levels are induced by X-irradiation and measured using flow cytometer and the fluorescent dye 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and microarray methods in cultured human K562, Me45 and HCT116 cells. Analysis of the nucleotide sequences of mRNAs which are up- or down-regulated after irradiation shows significant differences in the distributions of miRNA-targeted motives between these two groups. Immediately after irradiation most miRNAs behave as \u201cup-regulators\u201d, showing more targets in up-than in down-regulated transcripts, and this changes about 12\u00a0h later when we also observe changes in ROS and miRNA levels. Our results suggest that the changes in the transcriptome could result from changes in RNA interference and that these effects could be related to the changed ROS levels in irradiated cells. We propose that such modulation of gene expression at the mRNA level may be implicated more generally in cellular responses to stresses where ROS levels change.",

Nevertheless, little is known about the toxicological properties of DCDS. In the present study we evaluated the cytotoxic, genotoxic and mutagenic properties of DCDS in Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts (V79) and in strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, proficient and deficient in several DNA-repair pathways. The results with V79 cells show that DCDS induced cytotoxicity, GSH depletion and elevation of lipid peroxidation at lower concentrations than did DPDS. DCDS also generated single- and double-strand DNA breaks in V79 cells, both in the presence and in the absence of metabolic activation, as revealed by alkaline and neutral comet assays. Moreover, the induction of oxidative DNA base-damage was demonstrated by means of a modified comet assay with formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase and endonuclease III. Treatment with DCDS also induced micronucleus formation in V79 cells as well as point and frame-shift mutations in a haploid wild-type strain of S. cerevisiae. Yeast mutants defective in base excision-repair proteins were the most sensitive to DCDS. Pre-incubation with N-acetylcysteine reduced DCDS's oxidative, genotoxic and mutagenic effects in yeast and in V79 cells. Our findings indicate that the presence of cholesteroyl substituents in DCDS results in elevation of its cytotoxic and genotoxic potential compared with that of DPDS in yeast and in V79 cells. However, due to dose-dependent contrasting behaviour of organoselenium compounds and differences in their toxicity in in vitro and in vivo systems, further studies are needed in order to establish the non-toxic concentration range for treatment in mammals.",

Aluminum was identified as the SPL component mainly responsible for reduction of the mitotic index. Chromosomal alterations resulted from the interactions among the three main chemical components of SPL, without a clear predominantly responsible agent.

In this work, 16 centralized source waters in China were sampled from five river systems and genotoxicity of their organic extracts was assessed by use of the SOS/umu test for DNA-damaging effect and the miniaturized flow cytometry-based micronucleus (MN) test for chromosome-damaging effect. In addition, initial identification of potential genotoxicants for the six samples from the Yangtze River was done with a GC/MS method and the QSAR toolbox 3.0. The results demonstrate that eight samples showed both indirect and direct DNA-damaging effects, another four samples showed only indirect DNA-damaging effects, while chromosome-damaging effects were found for 14 out of the 16 samples, in which aneugenic and clastogenic modes of action were found for 4 and 10 samples, respectively. Both direct/indirect DNA-damaging effects and chromosome-damaging effects were induced by the six Yangtze River samples, and the existing different types of genotoxicant confirmed the results. Furthermore, o-phenylphenol was initially identified as the major cause for the DNA-damaging effects while PAHs, pesticides, phenol and anthraquinone were identified as ubiquitous chromosome-damaging agents among these samples. In conclusion, a combination of the SOS/umu test and the miniaturized flow cytometry-based MN test to detect both DNA-damaging and chromosome-damaging effects could be used as a comprehensive genotoxicity assessment tool for the evaluation and classification of genotoxicity of complex mixtures, and potential genotoxicants can be initially identified with additional information from chemical analysis and the QSAR toolbox.",

     "abstract": "Stainless steel bands, with or without silver soldered joints, are routinely used in orthodontics. However, little is known about the toxic biological effects of these appliances. The aims of this study were to evaluate the cytotoxic, cytostatic, genotoxic and DNA damage-inducing effects of non-soldered bands (NSB) and silver soldered bands (SSB) on the HepG2 and HOK cell lines and to quantify the amount of ions released by the bands. The 24-h metallic eluates of NSBs and SSBs were quantified by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. An MTT reduction assay was performed to evaluate the cytotoxicity, alkaline and modified comet assays were employed to measure genotoxicity and oxidative DNA damage effects, and cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assays were used to verify DNA damage, cytostasis and cytotoxicity. Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu and Zn were detected in SSB medium samples, and Fe and Ni were detected in both the SSB and NSB medium samples. The SSB group induced stronger cytotoxic effects than the NSB group in both evaluated cell lines. NSB and SSB induced genotoxicity as evaluated by comet assays; stronger effects were observed in the SSB group. Both groups induced similar increases in the number of oxidative DNA lesions, as detected by the FPG and Endo III enzymes. Nucleoplasmic bridges, biomarkers of DNA misrepair and/or telomere end fusions, were significantly elevated in the SSB group. The SSB eluates showed higher amounts of Ni and Fe than NSB, and all the quantified ions were detected in SSB eluates, including Cd. The SSB eluates were more cytotoxic and genotoxic than the NSB samples. Based on these results, we propose that other brands, materials and techniques should be further investigated for the future manufacture of orthodontic appliances.",

For this purpose, three interlinked endpoints were analyzed: induction of DNA damage by use of the micronucleus (MN) test (genotoxic damage), cell viability by means of the MTS assay, and differential staining (cytotoxic damage) and clonogenic death via the colony-formation test (cytotoxic damage). The MN test revealed that propolis alone (5\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) was not genotoxic up to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and that 30\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of propolis reduced the radiation-induced DNA damage (\u223c56% reduction, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), exhibiting a radio-protective effect on irradiated CHO-K1 cells. On the other hand, analysis of cytotoxicity showed that a concentration of 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL presented a significant proliferative effect (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when associated with radiation, decreasing the percentage of necrotic cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). No mediated cytotoxic effect was found, but the concentration of 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL was toxic when analyzed at 24 and 48\u00a0h via the differential staining technique, but not at 72\u00a0h after irradiation, analyzed with the MTS assay. Differential staining also showed that necrosis was the main death modality in irradiated cells and that apoptosis was induced only at the toxic concentration of propolis (200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). Concerning the clonogenic capacity, a concentration of 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL also exhibited a significant stimulating effect on cell proliferation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), in agreement with the data from differential staining. Taken together, these data suggest that the use of propolis AF-08 for the prevention of the adverse effects of ionizing radiation is promising. Nevertheless, additional investigations are necessary for a better understanding of potential applications of propolis to improve human health.",

This study examined the metal content and the transcriptional status of gene markers associated with oxidative stress, metal transport and DNA damage in livers of feral mice collected near coal-mining operations, in comparison with mice obtained from a reference site. Mus musculus specimens were caught from La Loma and La Jagua, two coal-mining sites in the north of Colombia, as well as from Valledupar (Cesar Department), a city located 100\u00a0km north of the mines. Concentrations in liver tissue of Hg, Zn, Pb, Cd, Cu and As were determined by differential stripping voltammetry, and real-time PCR was used to measure gene expression. Compared with the reference group (Valledupar), hepatic concentrations of Cd, Cu and Zn were significantly higher in animals living near mining areas. In exposed animals, the mRNA expression of NQ01, MT1, SOD1, MT2, and DDIT3 was 4.2-, 7.3-, 2.5-, 4.6- and 3.4-fold greater in coal mining sites, respectively, than in animals from the reference site (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These results suggest that activities related to coal mining may generate pollutants that could affect the biota, inducing the transcription of biochemical markers related to oxidative stress, metal exposure, and DNA damage. These changes may be in part linked to metal toxicity, and could have implications for the development of chronic disease. Therefore, it is essential to implement preventive measures to minimize the effects of coal mining on its nearby environment, in order to protect human health.",

HI-6-dimethanesulfonate is a salt of the oxime HI-6 used in the treatment of nerve-agent poisoning. It is known to be the best re-activator component of inactivated acetyl cholinesterase. HI-6-dimethanesulfonate has shown a higher level of solubility with similar potency to reactivate acetyl cholinesterase and a similar pharmacokinetics profile compared with HI-6 dichloride. HI-6 dimethanesulfonate was tested for its mutagenic and genotoxic potential by use of the standard ICH S2R (1) battery for the evaluation of pharmaceuticals. HI-6-dimethanesulfonate was mutagenic in the Ames test only in the presence of metabolic activation. In the mutation assay at the Tk locus in L5178Y mouse-lymphoma cells, HI-6-dimethanesulfonate showed mutagenic activity both with and without metabolic activation, with a significant increase in small colonies. The effects were in favour of a clastogenic activity. It was concluded that the compound was mutagenic and possibly clastogenic in vitro. In contrast, the in vivo micronucleus test in rat bone-marrow did not demonstrate any genotoxic activity and the Comet assay performed in rat liver did not show any statistically or biologically significant increases in DNA strand-breaks. The results of both in vivo studies performed on two different organs with two endpoints are sufficient to conclude the absence of a genotoxic hazard in vivo and to consider that there is no genotoxic concern in humans for HI-6-dimethanesulfonate.",

In this experiment, male Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD) rats were treated with the model clastogen cyclophosphamide (CP: 5, 10 or 15\u00a0mg/kg) by a single oral administration. As controls, rats were treated with physiological saline (solvent) in the same manner as for the model clastogen. Peripheral blood was collected from each rat 48\u00a0h after the treatment. The blood samples were prepared at the Public Interest Incorporated Foundation, BioSafety Research Center (BSRC) in duplicate using the rat MicroFlowPLUS Kit. After fixation, one replicate set of samples was shipped to Litron Laboratories, and each sample was analyzed by flow cytometry at the two laboratories. In addition, the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MNRETs) was determined at the BSRC by microscopic analysis using supravital acridine orange (AO) staining. The reproducibility of micronucleated reticulocyte frequencies analyzed by microscopy and flow cytometry showed good correlation (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.84). The frequencies of micronucleated reticulocytes analyzed by flow cytometry at the two independent laboratories showed good concordance (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.97). The data indicate that the flow cytometric micronucleus analysis method is a good alternative to manual microscopic analysis. Flow cytometry allows groups to readily score 5000 or even 20,000 RETs in a matter of minutes compared to manual analysis. This results in increased reliability of the assay by achieving better statistical power.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxic, genotoxic and anti-genotoxic, mutagenic and anti-mutagenic potentials of Apis mellifera venom in HepG2 cells. In this evaluation, the MTT test was applied to determine the most appropriate concentrations for the genotoxicity and mutagenicity tests. It was verified that the concentrations of 0.1, 0.05 and 0.01\u00a0\u03bcg/mL were not cytotoxic, hence these concentrations were used in the experiments. For the evaluation of the genotoxic and mutagenic potential of the bee venom the comet assay and the micronucleus test were applied, respectively. The concentrations mentioned above presented both genotoxic and mutagenic potential for HepG2 cells and it was necessary to test lower concentrations of the venom (10\u00a0pg/mL, 1\u00a0pg/mL and 0.1\u00a0pg/mL) for the anti-genotoxicity and anti-mutagenicity tests, which were performed subjecting the cells to the action of MMS (methyl methanesulfonate) in order to verify the ability of the venom to inhibit or diminish the action of this compound, which has a recognized action on the genetic material. Pre-, post-treatment and simultaneous treatment with and without incubation with the venom were performed. It was observed that the lowest three concentrations tested did not present any anti-genotoxic and anti-mutagenic activity on the cells. The use of bee venom for pharmacological purposes in treatments such as cancer must be done with extreme caution, since it was observed that even at very low concentrations the venom can induce genotoxicity and mutagenicity in human cells, as was verified for the HepG2 cells.",

Although epidemiological studies have identified individual polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 genes that may alter cancer risk, there is often conflicting data about whether such polymorphisms alter the genotoxicity of environmental carcinogens. This is particularly true of the CYP1A2 polymorphisms that confer differential activation of multiple human carcinogens. To determine whether a single cytochrome P450 polymorphism confers higher levels of carcinogen-associated genotoxicity, we chose an organism that lack enzymes to metabolically activate aflatoxins and expressed individual human P450 genes in budding yeast. We measured the frequencies of recombination, Rad51 foci formation, 7-methoxyresorufin O-demethylase activities, and the concentrations of carcinogen-associated DNA adducts in DNA repair proficient yeast expressing P450 polymorphisms after exposure to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1).We measured growth of rad4 rad51 cells expressing CYP1A2 polymorphisms while exposed to AFB1. We observed that there was significantly less AFB1-associated genotoxicity in yeast expressing CYP1A2 I386F, while yeast expressing CYP1A2 C406Y exhibited intermediate levels of genotoxicity compared to yeast expressing CYP1A2 D348N or wild type. We conclude that differences in carcinogen genotoxicity can be observed in yeast expressing different CYP1A2 alleles.

Exposure to COF caused up-regulation of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. COF induced the mitochondrial permeability transition, an early event in apoptosis; cytochrome c was translocated from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm and nucleus. Caspase-9 and caspase-3 were activated, as a consequence of the mitochondrial permeability transition. The death receptor apoptotic pathway was triggered by COF, as indicated by a change in Fas expression, resulting in increased caspase-8 content.

More than 300,000 people participated in the clean-up activities, which lasted for up to 10 months. Previous studies reported increases in genotoxicity endpoints in individuals exposed to Prestige oil, both at the moment of exposure [DNA breakage, micronuclei (MN), sister chromatid exchange] and two years later (chromosomal aberrations). In this work we carried out for the first time the follow-up of genotoxic effects in subjects exposed to an oil spill seven years after the exposure. The main objective was to determine the possible persistence of genotoxic damage in individuals exposed to Prestige oil seven years after the accident. The exposed group was composed of 54 residents of Galician villages in Spain that were heavily affected by the spill. This group was involved in clean-up labor for at least two months in the period November 2002\u2013September 2003. They were compared with 50 matched controls. Primary DNA damage was evaluated by the comet assay, mutagenicity by the T-cell receptor (TCR) mutation assay, and MN frequency was determined both by the cytokinesis-block test and by flow cytometry. The results obtained showed no significant differences between the exposed and the controls in the comet assay, the TCR mutation assay and the cytokinesis-block MN test. An unexpected and significant decrease was observed in the exposed group for the results of the MN test evaluated by flow cytometry, probably influenced by modifying factors \u2013 other than age, sex and smoking \u2013 not considered in this study. Our results show no evidence of the persistence of genotoxic damage in individuals exposed to Prestige oil seven years later.

A cytogenetic study was conducted in a group of 16 Portuguese individuals by use of the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay. A dose\u2013response curve for micronuclei yield was established with a linear-quadratic model: Y\u00a0=\u00a0(0.0122\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0010)\u00a0+\u00a0(0.0241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0023)D\u00a0+\u00a0(0.0193\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0007)D2. Also, baseline values for the micronucleus formation in the 16 donors were analyzed, with results in close agreement with those from other laboratories. A validation experiment was carried out with three individuals. The real and the estimated doses obtained with the dose\u2013response curve were in very good agreement, allowing the use of the micronucleus dose\u2013response calibration curve in biological dosimetry for estimation of radiation dose in case of overexposure.The results obtained for the cytogenetic endpoints, studied in the same group of 16 individuals, were also analyzed as a function of age and gender. A higher inter-variability was observed for the higher dose points and differences in response were identified between genders, above 2\u00a0Gy, for all endpoints.",

     "abstract": "The lack of toxicological information on many of the compounds that humans use or are exposed to, intentionally or unintentionally, poses a big problem in risk assessment. To fill this data gap, more emphasis is given to fast in vitro screening tools that can add toxicologically relevant information regarding the mode(s) of action via which compounds can elicit adverse effects, including genotoxic effects. By use of bioassays that can monitor the activation of specific cellular signalling pathways, many compounds can be screened in a high-throughput manner. We have developed two new specific reporter-gene assays that can monitor the effects of compounds on two pathways of interest: the p53 pathway (p53 CALUX) for genotoxicity and the Nrf2 pathway (Nrf2 CALUX) for oxidative stress. To exclude non-specific effects by compounds influencing the luciferase reporter-gene expression non-specifically, a third assay was developed to monitor changes in luciferase expression by compounds in general (Cytotox CALUX). To facilitate interpretation of the data and to avoid artefacts, all three reporter-gene assays used simple and defined reporter genes and a similar cellular basis, the human U2OS cell line. The three cell lines were validated with a range of reference compounds including genotoxic and non-genotoxic agents. The sensitivity (95%) and specificity (85%) of the p53 CALUX was high, showing that the assay is able to identify various types of genotoxic compound, while avoiding the detection of false positives. The Nrf2 CALUX showed specific responses to oxidants only, enabling the identification of compounds that elicit part of their genotoxicity via oxidative stress. All reporter-gene assays can be used in a high-throughput screening format and can be supplemented with other U2OS-based reporter-gene assays that can profile nuclear receptor activity, and several other signalling pathways.",

     "abstract": "Arsenic originates from both geochemical and numerous anthropogenic activities. Exposure of the general public to significant levels of arsenic is widespread. Arsenic is a well-documented human carcinogen. Long-term exposure to high levels of arsenic in drinking water has been linked to bladder, lung, kidney, liver, prostate, and skin cancers. Among them, lung cancer is of great public concern. However, little is known about how arsenic causes lung cancer and few studies have considered effects in normal human lung cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of arsenic in human primary bronchial fibroblast and epithelial cells. Our data show that arsenic induces a concentration-dependent decrease in cell survival after short (24\u00a0h) or long (120\u00a0h) exposures. Arsenic induces concentration-dependent but not time-dependent increases in chromosome damage in fibroblasts. No chromosome damage is induced after either 24\u00a0h or 120\u00a0h arsenic exposure in epithelial cells. Using neutral comet assay and gamma-H2A.X foci forming assay, we found that 24\u00a0h or 120\u00a0h exposure to arsenic induces increases in DNA double strand breaks in both cell lines. These data indicate that arsenic is cytotoxic and genotoxic to human lung primary cells but lung fibroblasts are more sensitive to arsenic than epithelial cells. Further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms involved in arsenic-induced genotoxicity in human lung cells.",

Male gpt delta mice were given drinking water containing sodium arsenite for 3 weeks, and the hepatic genome was assayed for mutations 2 weeks later. The gpt mutation assays showed a significant increase in mutation frequency in the liver following arsenite exposure. Sequence analysis revealed that 67% of mutations detected are G:C to A:T transitions and 5% are G:C to T:A transversions in the control group, and arsenite exposure resulted in a markedly higher rate of G:C to T:A transversions (46% of mutations detected). G:C to T:A transversions have been reported to be induced following formation of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a representative product that results from oxidative DNA damage. We also detected a significant increase in 8-OHdG in the livers of the mice exposed to arsenite.

Here, we present the results of three in vivo genotoxicity assays of ABAQ. The comet assay revealed that DNA damage was significantly increased in the livers, kidneys, lungs, and bone marrows of ICR mice, 3\u00a0h after i.p. injection of ABAQ (50\u00a0mg/kg body weight (bw)). To evaluate clastogenicity, the peripheral blood micronucleus test was performed, also in ICR mice.

Our results show that, for all endpoints investigated, carbon ions are more effective than X-rays at the same radiation dose. Additionally, in long term studies (\u22658 days post-irradiation) chromosomal damage and the pluripotency state were investigated. These studies reveal that pluripotency markers are present in the progeny of cells surviving the exposure to both radiation types. However, only in the progeny of X-ray exposed cells the aberration frequency was comparable to that of the control population, while the progeny of carbon ion irradiated cells harbored significantly more aberrations than the control, generally translocations. We conclude that cells surviving the radiation exposure maintain pluripotency but may carry stable chromosomal rearrangements after densely ionizing radiation.",

     "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and carcinogen that is released into the environment through natural and anthropogenic sources. BaP toxicity is dependent on its metabolism by cytochrome P450s to the reactive metabolite benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide (BPDE), which is strongly associated with increased mutation frequency. BaP can also be metabolized to benzo[a]pyrene quinones that can undergo redox cycling and induce oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to examine if BaP exposure induces DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and subsequently activate DNA DSB repair pathways in the CHO 3\u20136 cell line and pKZ1 mouse model. In vitro assessment of homologous recombination (HR) showed significantly increased HR frequency following exposure to 10\u00a0\u03bcM of BaP. In vivo evaluations of BaP-induced DNA DSB repair demonstrated positive staining for intrachromosomal recombination events, which are associated with non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), in the lung and thymus of exposed animals that were statistically significant in the thymus when quantified by Western blotting. Gene expression analyses from mouse tissues showed significantly decreased expression of ATM and Xrcc6 in BaP-treated liver and lung. In addition, BaP exposure significantly reduced the expression of Xrcc5, p53, and DNA-PKcs in lung. Taken together, our results demonstrate that BaP increases DNA DSB repair in vitro and in vivo, and induces expression changes in DNA repair pathway genes. As repair of DNA DSBs is not error-free, aberrant DNA repair may be contributing to the mechanism of BaP-induced toxicity.",

FISH-based translocation analyses for six accident victims were then performed, and biological doses were estimated retrospectively by comparison with the dose\u2013effect curves. Reconstructed doses by FISH were compared with estimated doses obtained by analysis of di-centrics performed soon after exposure, or with dose estimates from tooth-enamel electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) data obtained at the same time as the FISH analysis. Follow-up FISH analyses for an adolescent victim were performed. Results showed that dose\u2013effect curves established in the present study follow a linear-quadratic model, regardless of the background translocation frequency. Estimated doses according to two dose\u2013effect curves for all six victims were similar. FISH dose estimations of three adult victims exposed to accidental radiation less than a decade prior to analysis (3, 6, or 7 years ago) were consistent with those estimated with tooth-enamel EPR measurements or analyses of di-centrics. Estimated doses of two other adult victims exposed to radiation over a decade prior to analysis (16 or 33 years ago) were underestimated and two to three times lower than the values obtained from analysis of di-centrics or tooth-enamel EPR. Follow-up analyses of the adolescent victim showed that doses estimated by FISH analysis decrease rapidly over time. Therefore, the accuracy of dose estimates by FISH is acceptable only when analysis is performed less than 7 years after exposure. Measurements carried out more than a decade after exposure through FISH analysis resulted in underestimation of the biological doses compared with values obtained through analysis of di-centrics and tooth-enamel EPR.",

However, some toxic agents increase the retrotransposition activity of L1 elements in somatic cells. In order to identify specific effects of neurotoxic metals on L1 activity in neuronal cells, we studied the effects of mercury and cobalt on L1-retroelement activity by measuring levels of cellular transcription, protein expression, and genomic retrotransposition in a neuroblastoma cell line compared with the effects in three non-neuronal cell lines. Our results show that mercury increased the expression of L1 RNA, the activity of the L1 5\u2032UTR, and L1 retrotransposition exclusively in the neuroblastoma cell line but not in non-neuronal cell lines. However, cobalt increased the expression of L1 RNA in neuroblastoma cells, HeLa cells, and wild-type human fibroblasts, and also increased the activity of the L1 5\u2032UTR as well as the SV40 promoter in HeLa cells but not in neuroblastoma cells. Exposure to cobalt did not result in increased retrotransposition activity in HeLa cells or neuroblastoma cells. We conclude that non-toxic levels of the neurotoxic agent mercury could influence DNA by increasing L1 activities, specifically in neuronal cells, and may make these cells susceptible to neurodegeneration over time.",

Although some studies suggested large increases in ovarian cancer risk related to fertility medications, this association has not been confirmed in other studies. Whether there could be a residual, small risk is still an open question. It is known that genomic instability and multiple genetic changes may be required in carcinogenesis. Genomic instability such as single-base changes, chromosomal rearrangements or aneuploidy may accelerate this process. Genomic instability is not only central to carcinogenesis, but it is also a factor in some neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or the neuromuscular disease myotonic dystrophy. For these reasons, this study was planned to examine genotoxic effects of CC in human lymphocytes by use of the chromosome aberration (CA) assay, the micronucleus (MN) test, the comet assay, and the test for bacterial mutagenicity in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 (Ames test). Concentrations of 0.40, 0.80, 1.60, and 3.20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of CC significantly increased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and micronuclei (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in cultured human lymphocytes, and of DNA damage (tail length, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, except 0.80\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) in isolated lymphocytes compared with their respective controls. The highest CC concentration at 24\u00a0h and highest two concentrations after the 48-h treatment significantly decreased the mitotic index.

The study area is characterized by the presence of numerous industrial activities, such as steel works, glassworks, and ship-building, metallurgical, mechanical and chemical industries. In the study, two biomonitoring experiments were performed during the dry and wet seasons of 2005. P. furfuracea lichen samples were exposed to various pollutants at 12 monitoring sites, distributed throughout the different parts of the province, and each experiment lasted for a period of four weeks. Genotoxic effects of environmental pollutants were evaluated with amplified fragment-length polymorphism (AFLP) molecular markers. The results indicate that the mixture of pollutants might have contributed to the changes in the band patterns obtained by AFLP analysis, reflecting the presence of DNA damage. The average value of polymorphism obtained from the amplification of the primers used was 45.0% for the wet period and 64.6% for the dry period.Genomic template stability (GTS) ratios revealed that the highest values belong to the P. furfuracea samples from Rural Site I and Rural Site II (97.9%, 99.3% respectively for the dry season), the lowest values were from Shanty II and Urban Road Site I (85.8%, 85.2%, respectively for the wet season).

     "abstract": "Arsenic(III)methyltransferase (AS3MT) has been demonstrated to be the key enzyme in the metabolism of arsenic as it catalyses the methylation of arsenite and monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) to form methylated arsenic species, which have higher toxic and genotoxic potential than the parent compounds. The aim of this study is to evaluate if genetic variation in the AS3MT gene influences arsenic-induced cytogenetic damage, measured by the micronucleus (MN) assay. AS3MT Met287Thr allele frequencies and MN values were determined for 207 subjects working in the copper-mine industry, who were exposed to variable levels of arsenic. The urinary arsenic profile was used as individual biomarker of arsenic exposure. Results indicate that the MN frequencies found in peripheral blood lymphocytes of the exposed population poorly correlate with the levels of total arsenic content in urine. Nevertheless, when workers were classified according to their AS3MT Met287Thr genotypes, significantly higher MN values were observed for those carrying the variant allele [odds ratio (OR), 3.4 (1.6\u20135.2); P\u00a0=\u00a00.0003)]. To our knowledge, these results are the first to show that genetic variation in AS3MT, especially the Met287Thr polymorphism, may play a role in modulating the levels of arsenic-induced cytogenetic damage among individuals chronically exposed to arsenic.",

Since the number of MetS patients has significantly increased over the past two decades and because MetS may lead to development of cardiovascular diseases, diabetes type-2, and cancer, it has become important to extend the knowledge on the pathogenesis of MetS and to establish its possible early biomarkers. Studies on MetS and DNA damage are few and are inconclusive. The aim of this study was to elucidate the involvement of DNA damage in the development of MetS and to establish if DNA damage can serve as early biomarker of MetS. A total of 121 subjects participated in the study: 56 healthy controls and 65 MetS patients who were diagnosed with MetS for the first time. The amount of primary DNA damage in peripheral leukocytes of the subjects was assessed with three types of comet assay: the alkaline, the hOGG1-modified, and the neutral comet assay. In addition, the extent of oxidative DNA damage was monitored in urine by assessing 8-oxo-dG. The parameters of the three types of comet assay did not differ between the control and the MetS group. Interestingly, urinary 8-oxo-dG level in the control group was higher than in the MetS group. Our results imply that DNA damage is not involved in the early stage of MetS and, therefore, DNA damage cannot serve as an early marker of MetS.",

This was accomplished for both rat bone-marrow and peripheral blood specimens following exposure to a variety of genotoxic and non-genotoxic chemicals, whereby micronucleus induction was measured both with FCM and with traditional microscopy. In an initial study, rats were treated with vehicle or cyclophosphamide (CP) for 2 consecutive days by oral gavage, and blood and bone marrow were sampled at 24\u00a0h after the second treatment. Staining with acridine orange (AO) of methanol-fixed slides was used for microscopical analysis and 2000 reticulocytes (RET) or polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) were scored for MN frequency. The erythrocytes in the remaining bone-marrow cell suspensions were eluted on cellulose columns. The eluted bone marrow as well as the peripheral blood cells was fixed, incubated and analyzed by FCM. In another experiment, the performance of the FCM-MN method was further evaluated with five clastogens (urethane, 5-fluorouracil, mitomycin C, methylmethane sulfonate and 6-thioguanine), two aneugens (vincristine sulfate and colchicine) and two non-genotoxic new drugs (compounds A and B), whose results were negative in the routine mouse-micronucleus test (MNT). The MN frequencies in rat peripheral blood induced by the positive chemicals were found to be lower than the frequencies in rat bone-marrow by both scoring methods. However, a high level of agreement for the MN frequencies in both compartments was obtained. Good correspondence between the two analysis methods was also achieved. These data provide support that the three-colour FCM method is more rapid and objective than manual microscopy, while yielding comparable data.

None of the derivatives of 2-ethyl-2-methylsuccinic acid (compounds 1\u20137) had mutagenic activity against the tester strains of V. harveyi, but this set had strong or moderate antimutagenic activity against 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (NQNO) in the tester strains BB7, BB7X, and BB7M.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential genotoxic effects of coal and oxidative stress in individuals from Candiota who were exposed to coal as part of their occupation. The comet assay and micronucleus (MN) test were used to assess these effects. This study involved 128 male participants of whom 71 reported work that included exposure to coal (exposed group) and 57 reported working at different jobs (unexposed group). The exposed group had a significantly increased damage index and damage frequency, as assessed using the comet assay, and increased MN and nucleoplasmic bridge frequencies, as assessed using the MN assay, compared with unexposed individuals. Significant and positive correlations between MN frequencies in the lymphocytes and buccal cells of control and exposed individuals were observed. The exposed individuals presented lower average levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and catalase activity (CAT), while the mean superoxide dismutase activity (SOD) levels were higher in this group. The exposed group also had higher hematocrit levels. No correlation between DNA damage and inorganic elements, as identified using PIXE, was found; however, there was a correlation between the damage index and zinc. The evidence that exposure to coal and its derivatives presents a genetic hazard demonstrates the need for protective measures and educational programs for coal miners.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of various environmental pollutants frequently found in aquatic environments and characterized by their endocrine disrupting activity. Monitoring of DNA damage was undertaken after in vivo exposures of the aquatic larvae of the midge Chironomus riparius, a model organism that represents an abundant and ecologically relevant macroinvertebrate, widely used in freshwater toxicology. DNA-induced damage, resulting in DNA fragmentation, was quantified by the comet assay after short (24\u00a0h) and long (96\u00a0h) exposures to different concentrations of the selected toxicants: bisphenol A (BPA), nonylphenol (NP), pentachlorophenol (PCP), tributyltin (TBT) and triclosan (TCS). All five compounds were found to have genotoxic activity as demonstrated by significant increases in all the comet parameters (%DNA in tail, tail length, tail moment and Olive tail moment) at all tested concentrations. Persistent exposure did not increase the extent of DNA damage, except for TCS at the highest concentration, but generally there was a reduction in DNA damage thought to be associated with the induction of the detoxification processes and repairing mechanisms. Comparative analysis showed differences in the genotoxic potential between the chemicals, as well as significant time and concentration-dependent variations, which most likely reflect differences in the ability to repair DNA damage under the different treatments. The present report demonstrates the sensitivity of the benthic larvae of C. riparius to these environmental genotoxins suggesting its potential as biomonitor organism in freshwater ecosystems. The results obtained about the DNA-damaging potential of these environmental pollutants reinforce the need for additional studies on the genotoxicity of endocrine active substances that, by linking genotoxic activity to other biological responses, could provide further understanding of adverse effects in aquatic environments.",

A treatment period of 96\u00a0h without a recovery period was most reliable for detecting MN formation in upcyte\u00ae hepatocytes from Donor 740. The basal MN rate in upcyte\u00ae hepatocytes varied considerably between donors (7\u201328%); therefore, modifications to the assay medium were tested to determine whether they could decrease inherent MN formation.

O6meG has been detected in human colonic DNA; hence, understanding the innate cellular events occurring in response to the formation of O6meG is important in developing preventive strategies for colorectal cancer. We explored the time-course, dose\u2013response, and kinetics of O6meG formation and its removal by the DNA repair protein, O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and apoptosis. In rats given AOM (10\u00a0mg/kg), the formation of O6meG occurs within 2\u00a0h of exposure, accompanied by rapid depletion of MGMT activity and followed by the induction of an acute apoptotic response that peaks at 6\u20138\u00a0h. MGMT repair and apoptosis are dependent on AOM dose and O6meG load. Apoptosis is initiated only when a high O6meG load is present and MGMT activity is fully depleted. AOM, 10\u00a0mg/kg, overwhelms MGMT repair for about 96\u00a0h and renewed MGMT activity is only observed once O6meG is no longer detectable. A threshold for apoptosis is observed at 6\u00a0h after 6\u00a0mg/kg AOM, when a high O6meG persists and MGMT activity is very low. These data suggest that apoptosis is probably triggered by O6meG, but only once the capacity of MGMT to repair O6meG is exhausted. In the colonic epithelium, apoptosis may be complementary to MGMT, in terms of minimising potentially mutagenic events and maintaining a healthy genome.",

We have evaluated the multi-tissue MN test method with a regimen in which rats were administered chemicals orally once per day for four days and the cells of each tissue were collected 24\u00a0h after the final dose. The following compounds were studied: N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), N-methyl-N-nitrosourethane (NMUT), 1,2-dimethylhydrazine 2HCl (DMH), 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine HCl (PhIP), KBrO3, amaranth (AM), and quercetin (QN). The gastrointestinal tract carcinogens increased the frequencies of micronucleated (MNed) cells in target tissue in a dose-dependent manner: MNU in gastric- and colonic-cells; 4NQO, MNNG, and NMUT in gastric cells; DMH and PhIP in colonic cells. In immature erythrocytes, MNU, 4NQO, DMH, and PhIP increased the frequency of MNed cells but MNNG and NMUT did not. The food additive KBrO3, which is known to be a renal carcinogen, increased the frequencies of MNed cells in the glandular stomach and bone marrow. The food additive AM and the plant flavonoid QN, which are non-carcinogenic in most studies, did not cause increased MNed cells in any of the three tissues. Our results indicate that this multi-tissue MN test method is useful for the comprehensive evaluation of the genotoxicity of orally administered compounds.",

The in vivo effects of short-term and long-term ELF\u2013EMF exposure on male Drosophila melanogaster were studied using transcriptomic analysis for preliminary screening and QRT-PCR for further verification.Transcriptomic analysis indicated that 439 genes were up-regulated and 874 genes were down-regulated following short-term exposures and that 514 genes were up-regulated and 1206 genes were down-regulated following long-term exposures (expression >2- or <0.5-fold, respectively). In addition, there are 238 up-regulated genes and 598 down-regulated genes in the intersection of short-term and long-term exposure (expression >2- or <0.5-fold). The DEGs (differentially expressed genes) in D. melanogaster following short-term exposures were involved in metabolic processes, cytoskeletal organization, mitotic spindle organization, cell death, protein modification and proteolysis. Long-term exposure let to changes in expression of genes involved in metabolic processes, response to stress, mitotic spindle organization, aging, cell death and cellular respiration. In the intersection of short-term and long-term exposure, a series of DEGs were related to apoptosis, aging, immunological stress and reproduction.To check the ELF\u2013EMF effects on reproduction, some experiments on male reproduction ability were performed. Their results indicated that short-term ELF\u2013EMF exposure may decrease the reproductive ability of males, but long-term exposures had no effect on reproductive ability. Down-regulation of ark gene in the exposed males suggests that the decrease in reproductive capacity may be induced by the effects of ELF\u2013EMF exposure on spermatogenesis through the caspase pathway. QRT-PCR analysis confirmed that jra, ark and decay genes were down regulated in males exposed for 1 Generation (1G) and 72\u00a0h, which suggests that apoptosis may be inhibited in vivo. ELF\u2013EMF exposure may have accelerated cell senescence, as suggested by the down-regulation of both cat and jra genes and the up-regulation of hsp22 gene. Up-regulation of totA and hsp22 genes during exposure suggests that exposed flies might induce an in vivo immune response to counter the adverse effects encountered during ELF\u2013EMF exposure. Down-regulation of cat genes suggests that the partial oxidative protection system might be restrained, especially during short-term exposures. This study demonstrates the bioeffects of ELF\u2013EMF exposure and provides evidence for understanding the in vivo mechanisms of ELF\u2013EMF exposure on male D. melanogaster.",

Some patients experience adverse events, such as BP-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ). DNA methylation plays a key role in gene regulation in many tissues, but its involvement in bone homeostasis is not well characterized, and no information is available regarding altered methylation in BRONJ. Using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip assay, we performed an epigenome-wide association study in peripheral blood samples from 68 patients treated with nitrogenous BP, including 35 with BRONJ. Analysis of the estimated cumulative BP exposure distribution indicated that the exposure of the case group to BP was slightly higher than that of the control group; more severely affected cases (i.e., with BRONJ in both mandible and maxilla) were significantly more exposed to BP than were those with BRONJ only in the mandible or maxilla (one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Logistic regression analysis confirmed the positive association between cumulative bisphosphonates exposure and risk of BRONJ (OR 1.015 per mg of cumulative exposure, 95% CI 1.004\u20131.032, p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). Although no statistically significant differences were observed between case and control groups, methylation levels of probes mapping on three genes, ERCC8, LEPREL1 and SDC2, were strongly associated with cumulative BP exposure levels (p\u00a0<\u00a01.31E\u2212007). Enrichment analysis, combining differentially methylated genes with genes involved in the mevalonate pathway, showed that BP treatment can affect the methylation pattern of genes involved in extracellular matrix organization and inflammatory responses, leading to more frequent adverse effects such as BRONJ. Differences in DNA methylation induced by BP treatment could be involved in the pathogenesis of the bone lesion.",

The co-culture methodology was adopted to study the in vitro bystander effects. DNA damage was measured using the micronucleus (MN) and \u03b3-H2AX assays. Cytotoxicity was measured using the trypan blue assay. Cell cycle kinetics was analyzed using flow cytometry. The overall results did not show any significant increase in either genotoxicity or cytotoxicity or a delay in the cell cycle kinetics in BMG-1 bystander cells co-cultured with BLM-exposed cells, suggesting that BLM did not induce a bystander response in the BMG-1 cells. Furthermore, the MN results of the BLM-exposed BMG-1 cells co-cultured with unexposed bystander human lung adenocarcinoma (A549 and NCI-H460) cells and vice versa suggested that the BMG-1 cells do not secrete bystander signals but do respond to those signals. Analyzing the underlying mechanism and pathways involved in preventing the cells from secreting bystander signals will provide new insights that can be applied to inhibit these mechanisms in other cell types, thereby preventing and controlling the bystander response and genomic instability and increasing the therapeutic gain in chemotherapy.",

Our previous work has disclosed that when rats were exposed to 0.5\u00a0mg CdCl2 (kg\u00a0d) for 8 and 12 weeks, the growth of peripheral white blood cells (WBC) was obviously stimulated but no over-proliferation of granulocyte\u2013monocyte (GM) progenitor cells was observed in the bone marrow, suggesting that the over-proliferation of lymphocyte was promoted by Cd exposure. Is DNA-methylation involved in this Cd-stimulated cell proliferation? The present study found that when human B lymphoblast HMy2.CIR cells were exposed to Cd with a dose lower than 0.1\u00a0\u03bcM for 3 months, both cell proliferation and mRNA expressions of DNA methyltransferases of DNMT1 and DNMT3b were increased, while the mRNA of tumor suppressor gene p16 was remarkably decreased. Furthermore, the level of genomic DNA methylation was increased and the CpG island in p16 promoter was hypermethylated in the Cd-exposed cells. A DNA demethylating agent, 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), diminished Cd-stimulated cell proliferation associated with p16 overexpression. Our results suggested that the chronic exposure of low dose Cd could induce hypermethylation of p16 promoter and hence suppress p16 expression and then promote cell proliferation, which might contribute to Cd-induced carcinogenesis.",

No significant relationships were observed between any cytogenetic endpoint and log(urine uranium) levels, smoking, or log(lifetime X-rays). Age at the time of blood draw showed significant relationships with all endpoints except for cells with acentric fragments.

Methoxyamine (MX) is an indirect inhibitor of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1), a multifunctional BER protein. We have evaluated the effects of MX on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of Dox in MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cells. MX has little effects on the viability and proliferation of Dox-treated cells. However, as assessed by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN), MX caused a significant 1.4-fold increase (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in the frequency of micronucleated binucleated cells induced by Dox, and also altered the distribution of the numbers of micronuclei.

The reconstructed skin micronucleus (RSMN) assay in EpiDerm\u2122 (MatTek Corporation, USA) has shown promise as a follow-up for positive in vitro mammalian genotoxicity tests. However, few studies have explored its better predictive performance compared with existing in vitro assays. In the present study, we followed the protocol of the RSMN assay and used eight chemicals to compare micronucleus (MN) induction with EpiDerm\u2122 with that in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEKs), both derived from human skin. The assessments of EpiDerm\u2122 conformed to those of in vivo MN assay, whereas those of NHEKs did not. The effect of cell differentiation status on MN induction was further addressed using a model compound, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), which is a major component of green tea extract that shows positive results in in vitro mammalian genotoxicity assays via oxidative stress and negative results in in vivo MN studies. RSMN assay in an underdeveloped epidermal model, EpiDerm-201\u2122 (MatTek Corporation), showed a negative result identical to that in EpiDerm\u2122, indicating that the barrier function of keratinocytes has limited impact. Analysis of the gene expression profile of both EpiDerm\u2122 and NHEKs after EGCG treatment for 12\u00a0h revealed that the expression of genes related to genotoxic response was significantly induced only in NHEKs. Conversely, antioxidative enzyme activities (catalase and glutathione peroxidase) in EpiDerm\u2122 were higher than those in NHEKs. These results indicate that EpiDerm\u2122 has antioxidant properties similar to those of a living body and is capable of eliminating oxidative stress that may be caused by EGCG under in vitro experimental conditions.",

After high-dose exposures, premature chromosome condensation (PCC) has become an important method in biodosimetry. PCC can be induced upon fusion with mitotic cells, or by treatment with chemicals such as calyculin A or okadaic acid. Several different cytogenetic endpoints have been measured with chemically induced PCC, e.g., via scoring of extra chromosome pieces or ring chromosomes. The dose\u2013effect curves published with chemically induced PCC show differences in their coefficients and in the distribution of rings among cells. Here we present a study with calyculin A to induce PCC in peripheral blood lymphocytes irradiated at nine different doses of \u03b3-rays up to 20\u00a0Gy. Colcemid was also added in order to observe metaphase cells. During microscopical analysis the chromosome aberrations observed in the different cell-cycle phases (G2/M-PCC, M/A-PCC and M cells) were recorded. The proportion of G2/M-PCC cells was predominant from 3 to 20\u00a0Gy, M cells decreased above 1\u00a0Gy and M/A-PCC cells remained constant at all doses and showed the highest frequencies of PCC rings. Depending on the cell-cycle phase there was a difference in the linear coefficients in the dose\u2013effect curves of extra fragments and rings. Poisson distribution among PCC rings was observed after calyculin A\u00a0+\u00a0colcemid treatment, facilitating the use of this methodology also for partial body exposures to high doses. This has been tested with two simulated partial exposures to 6 and 12\u00a0Gy. The estimated doses in the irradiated fraction were very close to the real dose, indicating the usefulness of this methodology.",

We used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to quantify genotoxic effects of the mutagen ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) on a sexual (Artemia franciscana) and an asexual (Artemia parthenogenetica) species of brine shrimp. The method provides information similar to that obtained with assessment of RAPD (random amplification of polymorphic DNA) but is more robust. Genetic damage was transmitted to the F1 generation in both Artemia species, but the sexual species showed a greater degree of recovery, as shown by higher values of genomic template stability. There was a strong correlation between DNA damage and effects on individual fitness parameters: size, survival, reproduction and population growth. These effects persisted into the F2 generation in A. parthenogenetica, but in the sexual A. franciscana only effects on fecundity continued beyond the exposed generation, even though there were substantial alterations in ISSR patterns in the F1 generation. Genetic biomarkers can thus be indicative of effects at the population level, but sexually reproducing species have a considerable assimilative capacity for the effects of genotoxins.",

     "abstract": "This paper presents comparisons of biological impacts of the oxidants H2O2 and t-BHP on human liver cells, and shows modulation of these effects by the phenolic compound carvacrol. To understand better how these oxidants exert their effect on DNA and on the activity of the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), we measured intracellular antioxidant glutathione (iGSH) and intracellular reactive oxidative species (iROS). DNA lesions corresponded to single-strand DNA breaks, alkali-labile lesions and formamido-pyrimidine-DNA-glycosylase (FPG)-sensitive sites. Pre-treatment of cells with carvacrol substantially decreased the number of H2O2-induced DNA lesions, but the number of t-BHP-induced DNA lesions was not reduced. Activities of both SOD and GPx were stimulated significantly by carvacrol and were reduced by the combined effect of carvacrol and oxidants. H2O2 and t-BHP alone influenced the level of antioxidant enzymes differently. While H2O2 did not markedly change the activity of SOD or GPx, lower concentrations of t-BHP stimulated activity of SOD and mainly GPx. The level of iROS was increased by both oxidants and decreased by carvacrol applied either alone or with oxidants. The level of iGSH was not influenced in any of the treatments tested. Our results show that although both oxidants induced oxidative stress and damaged cellular DNA, their influences on other molecular processes were different. The protective effect of carvacrol against DNA-damaging effects of H2O2 was unambiguous, but reduction by carvacrol of the DNA-damaging effect of t-BHP was not observed. These results suggest that the phenolic compound carvacrol contributes to the defence mechanisms of the human organism, but these beneficial effects are dependent on the origin and source of the actual oxidative stress.",

A total of 104 patients who met the American Diabetes Association criteria for type-2 diabetes were enrolled in the study. Of the 104 patients, 33 were being treated with sitagliptin (100\u00a0mg/day), 25 with pioglitazone (30\u00a0mg/day), 22 with rosiglitazone (4\u00a0mg/day), and 24 with medical nutrition therapy (control group). The results for all the genotoxicity endpoints were significantly different across the four study groups. Post hoc analysis revealed that the genotoxicity observed in the sitagliptin group was significantly higher than that observed in the medical nutrition therapy group, but lower than that occurring in subjects who received thiazolidinediones. All of the three cytotoxicity endpoints were significantly lower in patients treated by oral anti-diabetic agents compared with those who received medical nutrition therapy. However, the three indexes did not differ significantly in the sitagliptin, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone groups. Taken together, these pilot data indicate that sitagliptin and thiazolidinediones may exert genotoxic and cytotoxic effects in patients with type-2 diabetes. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the possible long-term differences between oral anti-diabetic drugs in terms of genotoxicity and cytotoxicity, and how these can modulate the risk of developing diabetic complications in general and cancer in particular.",

The present study was designed to elucidate the anti-diabetic effect of the water-soluble derivative of propolis (WSDP), which contains phenolic acids as the main compounds, and EGCG in alloxan-induced (75\u00a0mg/kg, iv) diabetes in mice. Intraperitoneal administration of EGCG or propolis at doses of 50\u00a0mg/kg body weight (bw) to diabetic mice for a period of 7 days resulted in a significant increase in body weight and in haematological/immunological blood parameters, as well as in 100% survival of the mice. A significant decrease in lipid peroxidation in liver, kidney and brain tissue was also observed in diabetic mice treated with these two agents. Additionally, EGCG and propolis clearly reduced DNA damage in peripheral lymphocytes of diabetic mice. Our studies demonstrate the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory potential of WSDP and EGCG, which could exert beneficial effects against diabetes and the associated consequences of free-radical formation in kidney, liver, spleen and brain tissue. The results suggest that dietary supplementation with WSDP or EGCG could potentially contribute to nutritional strategies for the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus.",

Isolated lymphocytes or whole blood from six individuals were \u03b3-irradiated with 5, 10, 15 and 20\u00a0Gy at a dose rate of 0.5\u00a0Gy/min. Following either 8- or 24-h post-exposure incubation of irradiated samples at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, chromosome spreads were prepared by standard PCC cytogenetic procedures. The protocol for PCC fusion proved to be effective at doses as high as 20\u00a0Gy, enabling the analysis of ring chromosomes and excess PCC fragments. The ring frequencies remained constant during the 8\u201324-h repair time; the pooled dose relationship between ring frequency (Y) and dose (D) was linear: Y\u00a0=\u00a0(0.088\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0D. During the repair time, excess fragments decreased from 0.91 to 0.59 chromatid pieces per Gy, revealing the importance of information about the exact time of exposure for dose assessment on the basis of fragments. Compared with other cytogenetic assays to estimate radiation dose, the PCC-Rf method has the following benefits: a 48-h culture time is not required, allowing a much faster assessment of dose in comparison with conventional scoring of dicentrics and rings in assays for chemically-induced premature chromosome condensation (PCC-Rch), and it allows the analysis of heavily irradiated lymphocytes that are delayed or never reach mitosis, thus avoiding the problem of saturation at high doses. In conclusion, the use of the PCC fusion assay in conjunction with scoring of rings in G0-lymphocytes offers a suitable alternative for fast dose estimation following accidental exposure to high radiation doses.",

     "abstract": "The effects of radioactive contamination on the phenotype of free-living organisms are poorly understood, mainly because of the difficulty of capturing the large numbers of individual specimens that are required to quantify rare events such as albinism and tumour formation. We hypothesized that the frequency of abnormalities like albinism and the frequency of radiation-induced diseases like cancer would increase with the level of background radiation, that the two markers of radiation would be positively correlated, and that the reduction in abundance of animals would be greater in species with a higher frequency of albinism and tumour formation, if these markers reliably reflected poor viability. Here we analyzed the frequency of albinistic feathers and tumours in a sample of 1669 birds captured during 2010\u20132012 at eight sites around Chernobyl that varied in level of background radiation from 0.02 to more than 200\u00a0\u03bcSv/h. We recorded 111 cases of partial albinism and 25 cases of tumour formation. Nominal logistic models were used to partition the variance into components due to species and background radiation. Radiation was a strong predictor of the two markers in birds, with a small, but significant effect of species for albinism. The slope of the relationship between abundance and radiation in different bird species was significantly inversely correlated with the frequency of albinism and tumours, as was to be expected if a common underlying cause (i.e. radiation) affects both variables. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that background radiation is a cause of albinism and tumours, that albinism and tumours are biomarkers of radiation exposure, and that high frequencies of albinism and tumours were present despite the low viability of birds with these conditions.",

     "abstract": "The measurement of DNA-repair activity by extracts from cells or tissues by means of the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay has a high potential to become widely used in biomonitoring studies. We assessed the inter-laboratory variation in reported values of DNA-repair activity on substrate cells that had been incubated with Ro19-8022 plus light to generate oxidatively damaged DNA. Eight laboratories assessed the DNA-repair activity of three cell lines (i.e. one epithelial and two fibroblast cell lines), starting with cell pellets or with cell extracts provided by the coordinating laboratory. There was a large inter-laboratory variation, as evidenced by the range in the mean level of repair incisions between the laboratory with the lowest (0.002\u00a0incisions/106\u00a0bp) and highest (0.988\u00a0incisions/106\u00a0bp) incision activity. Nevertheless, six out of eight laboratories reported the same cell line as having the highest level of DNA-repair activity. The two laboratories that reported discordant results (with another cell line having the highest level of DNA-repair activity) were those that reported to have little experience with the modified comet assay to assess DNA repair. The laboratories were also less consistent in ordering the repair activity of the other two cell lines, probably because the DNA-repair activity by extracts from these cell lines were very similar (on average approximately 60\u201365% of the cell line with the highest repair capacity). A significant correlation was observed between the repair activity found in the provided and the self-made cell extracts (r\u00a0=\u00a00.71, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), which indicates that the predominant source for inter-laboratory variation is derived from the incubation of the extract with substrate cells embedded in the gel. Overall, we conclude that the incubation step of cell extracts with the substrate cells can be identified as a major source of inter-laboratory variation in the modified comet assay for base-excision repair.",

As a promising follow-up to complement existing in vitro test batteries for genotoxicity, the HET-MN is currently undergoing a formal validation. To optimize the validation, the present study describes a critical analysis of previously obtained HET-MN data to check the experimental design and to identify the most appropriate statistical procedure to evaluate treatment effects. Six statistical challenges (I\u2013VI) of general relevance were identified, and remedies were provided which can be transferred to similarly designed test methods: a Williams-type trend test is proposed for overdispersed counts (II) by means of a square-root transformation which is robust for small sample sizes (I), variance heterogeneity (III), and possible downturn effects at high doses (IV). Due to near-to-zero or even zero-count data occurring in the negative control (V), a conditional comparison of the treatment groups against the mean of the historical controls (VI) instead of the concurrent control was proposed, which is in accordance with US-FDA recommendations. For the modified Williams-type tests, the power can be estimated depending on the magnitude and shape of the trend, the number of dose groups, and the magnitude of the MN counts in the negative control. The experimental design used previously (i.e. six eggs per dose group, scoring of 1000 cells per egg) was confirmed. The proposed approaches are easily available in the statistical computing environment R, and the corresponding R-codes are provided.",

Factors secreted by the irradiated cells communicate some of these signals. Conditioned medium from UVC-irradiated A375 human melanoma cells was used to study the BE. Exposure of cells to conditioned medium induce cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M transition. Although conditioned medium treatment, by itself, did not alter cell viability, treated cells were more resistant to the lethal action of UVC or H2O2. This protective effect of conditioned medium was lost within 8\u00a0h. Apoptotic or autophagic cell death was not involved in this resistance. Exposure to conditioned medium did not influence the rate of DNA repair, as measured by NAD+ depletion. The activities of catalase and superoxide dismutase were elevated in cells exposed to conditioned medium, but returned to normal levels by 8\u00a0h post-treatment. These results indicate a close correlation between BE-stimulated antioxidant activity and cellular sensitivity. Cell-cycle arrest and stimulation of antioxidant activity may account for the resistance to killing that was observed in bystander cells exposed to UVC or H2O2 treatment and are consistent with the role of the BE as a natural defense function triggered by UVC irradiation.",

One of the most recent advances to study the kinetics of DNA repair has been the development of laser microbeams to induce and visualize recruitment and loss of repair proteins to base damage in live mammalian cells. However, a number of studies have produced contradictory results that are likely caused by the different laser systems used reflecting in part the wavelength dependence of the damage induced. Additionally, the repair kinetics of laser microbeam induced DNA lesions have generally lacked consideration of the structural and chemical complexity of the DNA damage sites, which are known to greatly influence their reparability. In this review, we highlight the key considerations when embarking on laser microbeam experiments and interpreting the real time data from laser microbeam irradiations.

Clonogenic survival and micronucleus assays were used to estimate efficiencies of the different repair pathways for DNA damages produced by direct and indirect effects.Removal of the indirect effect of low-LET radiation by DMSO increased clonogenic survival and decreased MN formation for all cell lines investigated. A direct contribution of the indirect effect of radiation to DNA base damage was suggested by the significant protection by DMSO seen for the BER deficient cell line. Lesions formed by the indirect effect are more readily repaired by the NHEJ pathway than by HRR after irradiation with \u03b3-rays or \u03b1-particles as evaluated by cell survival and the yields of MN.The results obtained with BER- and NHEJ-deficient cells suggest that the indirect effect of radiation contributes significantly to the formation of repair substrates for these pathways.",

Only recently, however, the influence of the chromatin architecture itself on the DNA damage response has been recognised. Thus for heterochromatic DSBs the sensing and early recruitment of repair factors to the lesion occurs within the heterochromatic compartments, but the damage sites are subsequently relocated from the inside to the outside of the heterochromatin. While previous studies were accomplished at the constitutive heterochromatin of centromeric regions in mouse and flies, here we examine the DSB repair at the facultative heterochromatin of the inactive X chromosome (Xi) in humans. Using heavy ion irradiation we show that at later times after irradiation the DSB damage streaks bend around the Xi verifying that the relocation process is conserved between species and not specialised to repetitive sequences only. In addition, to measure chromatin relaxation at rare positions within the genome, we established live cell microscopy at the GSI microbeam thus allowing the aimed irradiation of small nuclear structures like the Xi. Chromatin decondensation at DSBs within the Xi is clearly visible within minutes as a continuous decrease of the DNA staining over time, comparable to the DNA relaxation revealed at DSBs in mouse chromocenters. Furthermore, despite being conserved between species, slight differences in the underlying regulation of these processes in heterochromatic DSBs are apparent.",

Following irradiation, both human and mouse ESCs (mESCs) maintain their pluripotent status and the capacity to differentiate into embryoid bodies and to form teratomas. Although informative of the maintenance of a pluripotent status, these studies never investigated the capability of irradiated ESCs to form specific differentiated phenotypes. Here, for the first time, 5\u00a0Gy-irradiated mESCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes, thus allowing the analysis of the long-term effects of ionizing radiations on the differentiation potential of a pluripotent stem cell population. On treated mESCs, 96\u00a0h after irradiation, a genome-wide expression analysis was first performed in order to determine whether the treatment influenced gene expression of the surviving mESCs. Microarrays analysis showed that only 186 genes were differentially expressed in treated mESCs compared to control cells; a quarter of these genes were involved in cellular differentiation, with three main gene networks emerging, including cardiogenesis. Based on these results, we differentiated irradiated mESCs into cardiomyocytes. On day 5, 8 and 12 of differentiation, treated cells showed a significant alteration (qRT-PCR) of the expression of marker genes (Gata-4, Nkx-2.5, Tnnc1 and Alpk3) when compared to control cells. At day 15 of differentiation, although the organization of sarcomeric \u03b1-actinin and troponin T proteins appeared similar in cardiomyocytes differentiated from either mock or treated cells, the video evaluation of the kinematics and dynamics of the beating cardiac syncytium evidenced altered contractile properties of cardiomyocytes derived from irradiated mESCs. This alteration correlated with significant reduction of Connexin 43 foci. Our results indicate that mESCs populations that survive an ionizing irradiation treatment are capable to differentiate into cardiomyocytes, but they have altered contractile properties.",

     "abstract": "The genetic heterogeneity presented by different cell lines derived from glioblastoma (GBM) seems to influence their responses to antitumoral agents. Although GBM tumors present several genomic alterations, it has been assumed that TP53, frequently mutated in GBM, may to some extent be responsible for differences in cellular responses to antitumor agents, but this is not clear yet. To directly determine the impact of TP53 on GBM response to ionizing radiation, we compared the transcription profiles of four GBM cell lines (two with wild-type (WT) TP53 and two with mutant (MT) TP53) after 8\u00a0Gy of gamma-rays. Transcript profiles of cells analyzed 30\u00a0min and 6\u00a0h after irradiation showed that WT TP53 cells presented a higher number of modulated genes than MT TP53 cells. Our findings also indicate that there are several pathways (apoptosis, DNA repair/stress response, cytoskeleton organization and macromolecule metabolic process) in radiation responses of GBM cell lines that were modulated only in WT TP53 cells (30\u00a0min and 6\u00a0h). Interestingly, the majority of differentially expressed genes did not present the TP53 binding site, suggesting secondary effects of TP53 on transcription. We conclude that radiation-induced changes in transcription profiles of irradiated GBM cell lines mainly depend on the functional status of TP53.",

     "abstract": "The exposure of tumour cells to high doses of ionizing radiation can induce endopolyploidization as an escape route from cell death. This strategy generally results in mitotic catastrophe during the first few days after irradiation. However, some cells escape mitotic catastrophe, polyploidize and attempt to undergo genome reduction and de-polyploidization in order to create new, viable para-diploid tumour cell sub-clones. In search for the consequences of ionizing radiation induced endopolyploidization, genome and chromosome architecture in nuclei of polyploid tumour cells, and sub-nuclei after division of bi- or multi-nucleated cells were investigated during 7 days following irradiation. Polyploidization was induced in p53-function deficient HeLa cells by exposure to 10\u00a0Gy of X-irradiation. Chromosome territories #1, #4, #12 and centromeres of chromosomes #6, #10, #X were labelled by FISH and analysed for chromosome numbers, volumes and spatial distribution during 7 days post irradiation. The numbers of interphase chromosome territories or centromeres, respectively, the positions of the most peripherally and centrally located chromosome territories, and the territory volumes were compared to non-irradiated controls over this time course. Nuclei with three copies of several chromosomes (#1, #6, #10, #12, #X) were found in the irradiated as well as non-irradiated specimens. From day 2 to day 5 post irradiation, chromosome territories (#1, #4, #12) shifted towards the nuclear periphery and their volumes increased 16- to 25-fold. Consequently, chromosome territories returned towards the nuclear centre during day 6 and 7 post irradiation. In comparison to non-irradiated cells (\u223c500\u00a0\u03bcm3), the nuclear volume of irradiated cells was increased 8-fold (to \u223c4000\u00a0\u03bcm3) at day 7 post irradiation. Additionally, smaller cell nuclei with an average volume of about \u223c255\u00a0\u03bcm3 were detected on day 7. The data suggest a radiation-induced generation of large intra-nuclear chromosome territories and their repositioning prior to genome reduction.",

     "abstract": "It is well established that chromosomes exist in discrete territories (CTs) in interphase and are positioned in a cell-type specific probabilistic manner. The relative localisation of individual CTs within cell nuclei remains poorly understood, yet many cancers are associated with specific chromosome rearrangements and there is good evidence that relative territorial position influences their frequency of exchange. To examine this further, we characterised the complexity of radiation-induced chromosome exchanges in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells by M-FISH analysis of PCC spreads and correlated the exchanges induced with their preferred interphase position, as determined by 1/2-colour 2D-FISH analysis, at the time of irradiation. We found that the frequency and complexity of aberrations induced were reduced in ellipsoid NHBE cells in comparison to previous observations in spherical cells, consistent with aberration complexity being dependent upon the number and proximity of damaged CTs, i.e. lesion proximity. To ask if particular chromosome neighbourhoods could be identified we analysed all radiation-induced pair-wise exchanges using SCHIP (statistics for chromosome interphase positioning) and found that exchanges between chromosomes (1;13), (9;17), (9;18), (12;18) and (16;21) all occurred more often than expected assuming randomness. All of these pairs were also found to be either sharing similar preferred positions in interphase and/or sharing neighbouring territory boundaries. We also analysed a human small cell lung cancer cell line, DMS53, by M-FISH observing the genome to be highly rearranged, yet possessing rearrangements also involving chromosomes (1;13) and (9;17). Our findings show evidence for the occurrence of non-random exchanges that may reflect the territorial organisation of chromosomes in interphase at time of damage and highlight the importance of cellular geometry for the induction of aberrations of varying complexity after exposure to both low and high-LET radiation.",

     "abstract": "Existing research has not fully explained how different types of ionizing radiation (IR) modulate the responses of cell populations or tissues. In our previous work, we showed that gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) mediates the propagation of stressful effects among irradiated cells exposed to high linear energy transfer (LET) radiations, in which almost every cells is traversed by an IR track. In the present study, we conducted an in-depth study of the role of GJIC in modulating the repair of potentially lethal damage (PLDR) and micronuclei formation in cells exposed to low- or high-LET IR. Confluent human fibroblasts were exposed in the presence or absence of a gap junction inhibitor to 200\u00a0kV X rays (LET\u00a0\u223c\u00a01.7\u00a0keV/\u03bcm), carbon ions (LET\u00a0\u223c\u00a076\u00a0keV/\u03bcm), silicon ions (LET\u00a0\u223c\u00a0113\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) or iron ions (LET\u00a0\u223c\u00a0400\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) that resulted in isosurvival levels. The fibroblasts were incubated for various times at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. As expected, high-LET IR were more effective than were low-LET X rays at killing cells and damaging DNA shortly after irradiation. However, when cells were held in a confluent state for several hours, PLDR associated with a reduction in DNA damage, occurred only in cells exposed to X rays. Interestingly, inhibition of GJIC eliminated the enhancement of toxic effects, which resulted in an increase of cell survival and reduction in the level of micronucleus formation in cells exposed to high, but not in those exposed to low-LET IR. The experiment shows that gap-junction communication plays an important role in the propagation of stressful effects among irradiated cells exposed to high-LET IR while GJIC has only a minimal effect on PLDR and DNA damage following low-LET irradiation. Together, our results show that PLDR and induction of DNA damage clearly depend on gap-junction communication and radiation quality.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are the main cellular source of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Alterations of mitochondrial metabolism and consequent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential may lead to redox imbalance and in turn to DNA damage, chromosomal instability and apoptosis. On the other hand, impaired mitochondrial functions may either exacerbate the detrimental effects of geno- and cytotoxic agents or may bring beneficial cellular responses. To study the role of mitochondria within this framework, AG01522 human primary fibroblasts were incubated with the mitochondrial polymerase \u03b3 inhibitor 2\u2032,3\u2032-dideoxycytidine (ddC), leading to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) depletion and to mitochondrial dysfunctions. The successful treatment toward mtDNA depletion was confirmed by Complex-IV subunit I (COX-I) immunofluorescence and western blot assays. mtDNA-depleted cells and their counterparts were ultrastructurally characterized by transmission electron microscopy. mtDNA-depleted cells showed dramatic mitochondrial alterations such as fragmentation and cristae disruption along with a reduction of the mitochondrial membrane potential and elevated levels of ROS. Despite increased ROS levels, we did not find any difference in telomere length between ddC-treated and untreated cells. The spontaneous rate of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and chromosome aberrations was significantly enhanced in mtDNA-depleted cells whereas the induction of DSBs by low-Linear Energy Transfer (LET) (X-rays; 7.7\u00a0keV/\u03bcm protons) and high-LET radiations (28.5\u00a0keV/\u03bcm protons) did not differ when compared with normal cells. However, in irradiated cells impaired mitochondrial functions seemed to bring beneficial cellular responses to the detrimental effect of radiations. In fact, after X-irradiation mtDNA-depleted cells show less remaining unrejoined DSBs than normal cells and furthermore a lower induction of cytogenetic damage.Overall, these data show that active mitochondrial functions are required for the proper maintenance of cellular genome stability in primary fibroblasts.",

     "abstract": "Modern radiotherapy treatment modalities are associated with undesired out-of-field exposure to complex mixed beams of high and low energy transfer (LET) radiation that can give rise to secondary cancers. The biological effectiveness of mixed beams is not known. The aim of the investigation was the analysis of chromosomal damage in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) exposed to a mixed beam of X-rays and alpha particles. Using a dedicated exposure facility PBL were exposed to increasing doses of alpha particles (from 241Am), X-rays and a mixture of both. Chromosomal aberrations were analysed in chromosomes 2, 8 and 14 using fluorescence in situ hybridisation. The found and expected frequencies of simple and complex aberrations were compared. Simple aberrations showed linear dose\u2013response relationships with doses. A higher than expected frequency of simple aberrations was only observed after the highest mixed beam dose. A linear-quadratic dose response curve for complex aberrations was observed after mixed-beam exposure. Higher than expected frequencies of complex aberrations were observed for the two highest doses. Both the linear-quadratic dose\u2013response relationship and the calculation of expected frequencies show that exposure of PBL to mixed beams of high and low LET radiation leads to a higher than expected frequency of complex-type aberrations. Because chromosomal changes are associated with cancer induction this result may imply that the cancer risk of exposure to mixed beams in radiation oncology may be higher than expected based on the additive action of the individual dose components.",

Confluent normal fibroblasts were exposed to X-rays or accelerated particles with different LET values and chromosome aberrations were investigated in the first G0/G1 and G2//M phase. The particles used here were 490\u00a0MeV/nucleon Si, 500\u00a0MeV/nucleon Fe, and 200\u00a0MeV/nucleon Fe ions. Cells were subcultured 24\u00a0h after exposure and premature chromosome condensation (PCC) was performed by fusion-induced method for analysis of G0/G1 cells, and chemically-induced method for analysis of G2 and metaphase cells. Chromosome damage was assessed in chromosomes 1 and 3 using whole chromosome fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry at different incubation times following subculture. After irradiation with 2\u00a0Gy of high-LET particles, the yields of chromosome aberrations and fragments were significantly higher in G0/G1 phase than in G2/M phase, whereas similar yields of damage were measured in both phases after exposure to X-rays. In contrast, the yield of misrepair, assessed by the number of color junctions, was similar in the G0/G1 and G2/M phases after exposure to either X-rays or high-LET particles. The yields of chromosome aberrations, fragments, and color junctions in both the G0/G1 and the G2/M phases, increased with LET up to 200\u00a0keV/\u03bcm, then decreased for 440\u00a0keV/\u03bcm Fe particles. A good correlation was found between chromosome aberrations in both G0/G1 and G2/M cells and survival fractions after 2\u00a0Gy of different LET radiations, although the slopes were steeper for the G0/G1 cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that high-LET particles induce more non cycling G0/G1 cells within 48\u00a0h of subculture than X-rays, suggesting that chromosome aberrations scored at the G2/M phase may not accurately describe the true radiation effect.",

Proteins assembled at IR-induced DSB sites can be visualized as foci, including \u03b3H2AX, 53BP1, ATM and ATF2. Unrepaired DSBs are thought to be one origin of micronuclei (MN), an indicator of genotoxic stress and chromosomal instability. Studies have detected \u03b3H2AX in IR-induced MN, indicating the presence of DSB in MN. Previously we reported that TGF\u03b2 downstream proteins Smad7 and phospho-Smad2 (pSmad2) co-localized with DDR proteins following radiation. Here we studied the status of Smad7 and pSmad2 in MN post high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in human normal and cancerous cells. We observed \u03b3H2AX foci in IR-induced MN, whereas 53BP1 and ATF2 were absent. Interestingly, Smad7 foci, but not pSmad2, were detectable in both spontaneous and IR-induced MN. We compared the effect of particle track structures on the yield of MN using 5.6\u00a0MeV/u boron (B) and 600\u00a0MeV/u iron (Fe) particles with similar LET (200 and 180\u00a0keV/\u03bcm, respectively) in human fibroblasts. The frequency of MN induced by B was lower than that by Fe particles, albeit the proportion of Smad7-positive to Smad7-negative MN remained constant. An increased frequency of spontaneous MN, with slightly higher ratio of Smad7 or \u03b3H2AX positive, was found in human prostate cancer cells (PC3) compared to normal cells. 24\u00a0h after 1\u00a0Gy of Fe particles exposure, the yield of MN increased, and the majority (\u223c70%) carried \u03b3H2AX and Smad7. Phospho-ATM (Ser1981) foci were found in both spontaneous and IR-induced MN in PC3 cells, displaying a much lower frequency compared to \u03b3H2AX and Smad7.

In radiation-induced acute myeloid leukaemia (rAML), a partial hemizygous deletion of mouse chromosome 2 is a common feature in several susceptible strains. The deletion is an early event detectable 24\u00a0h after exposure in bone marrow cells using cytogenetic techniques. Expanding clones of bone marrow cells with chromosome 2 deletions can be detected less than a year after exposure to ionising radiation in around half of the irradiated mice. Ultimately, 15\u201325% of exposed animals develop AML. It is generally assumed that leukaemia originates in an early progenitor cell or haematopoietic stem cell, but it is unknown whether the original chromosome damage occurs at a similar frequency in committed progenitors and stem cells. In this study, we monitored the frequency of chromosome 2 deletions in immature bone marrow cells (Lin\u2212) and haematopoietic stem cells/multipotent progenitor cells (LSK) by several techniques, fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) and through use of a reporter gene model, flow cytometry and colony forming units in spleen (CFU-S) following ex vivo or in vivo exposure. We showed that partial chromosome 2 deletions are present in the LSK subpopulation, but cannot be detected in Lin\u2212 cells and CFU-S12 cells. Furthermore, we transplanted irradiated Lin\u2212 or LSK cells into host animals to determine whether specific irradiated cell populations acquire an increased proliferative advantage compared to unirradiated cells. Interestingly, the irradiated LSK subpopulation containing cells carrying chromosome 2 deletions does not appear to repopulate as well as the unirradiated population, suggesting that the chromosomal deletion does not provide an advantage for growth and in vivo repopulation, at least at early stages following occurrence.",

     "abstract": "There is a considerable controversy as to whether DNA damage induced by low doses and low dose rates of ionizing radiation is treated by cellular defence mechanisms in ways similar to that induced at high doses and high dose rates, and what downstream delayed effects may be caused by low doses compared to moderate and high doses. This constitutes the major challenge for the linear no-threshold model currently used for radiological risk estimates. Among the various DNA lesions induced by ionizing radiation, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are considered the most important due to their potential to cause cell death, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. This study examined the accumulation of DNA DSBs in mouse blood leucocytes and splenocytes after long-term, chronic low dose \u03b3-irradiation in vivo, and how this exposure may alter cell sensitivity to acute high dose irradiation. Animals were irradiated for 40, 80 or 120 days at a dose rate of 0.15\u00a0mGy/h, with total accumulated doses of 144, 288 and 432\u00a0mGy. DNA DSBs were measured in blood leucocytes and splenocytes using the neutral comet assay. We found that after an initial slight increase in the level of DNA DSBs at 40 days of exposure compared to controls, there was a subsequent drop after either 80 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) or 120 days of exposure (P\u00a0=\u00a00.066 for blood leucocytes; P\u00a0=\u00a00.024 for splenocytes). Interestingly, the DNA breaks level after both 80 and 120 days of exposure was lower than in control. Similarly, the cells exposed to the chronic radiation for 80 and 120 days were less sensitive to the induction of DNA DSBs by acute 4\u00a0Gy irradiation, whereas 40 days of exposure did not significantly modify the radiosensitivity. Our results indirectly indicate that low level ionizing radiation in vivo may trigger inducible repair of both endogenous and exogenous DNA DSBs, and that there is a dose threshold for this inducible defence mechanism, below which it does not occur. These data provide new evidence, now at the molecular level in vivo, that the dose\u2013response for DNA DSBs at very low doses and dose rates is not linear.",

Squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCCVII) were transplanted into the right hind legs of syngeneic C3H male mice. Irradiation with either carbon-ion beams with a 6-cm spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP, at 46 and 80\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) or X-rays was delivered to 5-mm or less diameter tumors. We defined three different oxygen statuses of the irradiated cells. Hypoxic and normoxic conditions in tumors were produced by clamping or not clamping the leg to avoid blood flow. Furthermore, single-cell suspensions were prepared from non-irradiated tumors and directly used to determine the radiation response of aerobic cells. Single-cell suspensions (aerobic condition) were fully air-saturated. Single-cell suspensions were prepared from excised and trypsinized tumors, and were used for in vivo\u2013in vitro colony formation assays to obtain cell survival curves. The RBE values increased with increasing LET in SOBP beams. The maximum RBE values in three different oxygen conditions; hypoxic tumor, normoxic tumor and aerobic cells, were 2.16, 1.76 and 1.66 at an LET of 80\u00a0keV/\u03bcm, respectively. After X-ray irradiation the OERh/n values (hypoxic tumor/normoxic tumor) were lower than the OERh/a (hypoxic tumor/aerobic cells), and were 1.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 and 2.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11, respectively. The OER values of carbon-ion irradiated samples were small in comparison to those of X-ray irradiated samples. However, no significant changes of the OER at proximal and distal positions within the SOBP carbon-ion beams were observed. To conclude, we found that the RBE values for cell survival increased with increasing LET and that the OER values changed little with increasing LET within the SOBP carbon-ion beams.",

Peripheral blood was collected from 12 breast cancer patients showing no early skin reactions after radiotherapy (RTOG grade 0) and from 14 breast cancer patients who developed acute severe skin reactions (RTOG grade 3\u20134). Whole blood was irradiated with 0, 5 and 2000\u00a0mGy \u03b3-radiation and serum was isolated. The biomarker for oxidative stress, 8-oxo-dG, was analyzed in the serum by a modified ELISA. While a significant radiation-induced increase of serum 8-oxo-dG levels was observed in serum of the RTOG 0 patients, no increase was seen in serum of the RTOG 3\u20134 patients. The radiation induced increase in serum 8-oxo-dG levels after 5\u00a0mGy did not differ significantly from the increase observed for 2000\u00a0mGy in the RTOG 3\u20134 cohort, thus no dose response relation was observed. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) value of 0.97 was obtained from the radiation-induced increase in 8-oxo-dG indicating that the assay could be used to identify patients with severe acute adverse reactions to radiotherapy. The results show that samples of whole blood from patients, classified as highly radiosensitive (RTOG 3\u20134) based on their skin reactions to radiotherapy, differ significantly in their oxidative stress response to ionizing radiation compared to samples of whole blood from patients with no skin reactions (RTOG 0). Extracellular 8-oxo-dG is primarily a biomarker of nucleotide damage and the results indicate that the patients with severe acute skin reactions differ in their cellular response to ionizing radiation at the level of induction of oxidative stress or at the level of repair or both.",

No other patient had clonal aberrations, but this patient showed ring chromosomes in the range of 21\u201325% of lymphocytes. He received 5 cycles of 5-fluorouracil/folic acid for chemotherapy of sigmoid colon carcinoma in 2003, three years before radiotherapy of prostate cancer.Blood samples were irradiated ex vivo with Cs-137 \u03b3-rays (0.7\u00a0Gy/min) in the G0-phase of the cell cycle. 100 FISH painted metaphases were analysed for the control and the irradiated samples each. Multicolour in situ hybridisation techniques like mFISH and mBand as well as MYC locus, telomere and centromere painting probes were used to characterise ring metaphases. Metaphase search and autocapture was performed with a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope followed by scoring and image analysis using Metafer 4/ISIS software (MetaSystems).In 2009 chromosome 8 rings were found in about 25% of lymphocytes. Rings were stable over time and increased to about 30% until 2012. The ring chromosome 8 always lacked telomere signals and a small amount of rings displayed up to four centromere signals. In aberrant metaphases 8pter and 8qter were either translocated or deleted. Further analyses revealed that the breakpoint at the p arm is localised at 8p21.2\u201322. The breakpoint at the q arm turned out to be distal from the MYC locus at 8q23\u201324.We hypothesise that the ring chromosome 8 has been developed during the 5 FU/folic acid treatments in 2003. The long term persistence might be due to clonal expansion of a damaged but viable hematopoietic stem cell giving rise to cycling progenitor cells that permit cell survival and proliferation.",

It has been shown that single space missions of a few months or more on the ISS can induce measureable increases in the yield of chromosome damage in the blood lymphocytes of astronauts, and it appears that cytogenetic biodosimetry can be used reliably to estimate equivalent dose and radiation risk. We have now obtained direct in vivo measurements of chromosome damage in blood lymphocytes of five astronauts before and after their first and second long duration space flights. Chromosome damage was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization technique using three different chromosome painting probes. All astronauts showed an increase in total exchanges and translocations after both the first and second flight.

We aim to develop the \u03b3-H2AX foci assay into a rapid biomarker tool for use in accidents. Here, five laboratories established a standard operating procedure and analysed 100 ex vivo \u03b3-irradiated, 4 or 24\u00a0h incubated and overnight-shipped lymphocyte samples from four donors to generate \u03b3-H2AX reference data, using manual and/or automated foci scoring strategies. In addition to acute, homogeneous exposures to 0, 1, 2 and 4\u00a0Gy, acute simulated partial body (4\u00a0Gy to 50% of cells) and protracted exposures (4\u00a0Gy over 24\u00a0h) were analysed. Data from all laboratories could be satisfactorily fitted with linear dose response functions. Average yields observed at 4\u00a0h post exposure were 2\u20134 times higher than at 24\u00a0h and varied considerably between laboratories. Automated scoring caused larger uncertainties than manual scoring and was unable to identify partial exposures, which were detectable in manually scored samples due to their overdispersed foci distributions. Protracted exposures were detectable but doses could not be accurately estimated with the \u03b3-H2AX assay. We conclude that the \u03b3-H2AX assay may be useful for rapid triage following a recent acute radiation exposure. The potentially higher speed and convenience of automated relative to manual foci scoring needs to be balanced against its compromised accuracy and inability to detect partial body exposures. Regular re-calibration or inclusion of reference samples may be necessary to ensure consistent results between laboratories or over long time periods.",

     "abstract": "Mass casualty scenarios of radiation exposure require high throughput biological dosimetry techniques for population triage in order to rapidly identify individuals who require clinical treatment. The manual dicentric assay is a highly suitable technique, but it is also very time consuming and requires well trained scorers. In the framework of the MULTIBIODOSE EU FP7 project, semi-automated dicentric scoring has been established in six European biodosimetry laboratories.Whole blood was irradiated with a Co-60 gamma source resulting in 8 different doses between 0 and 4.5\u00a0Gy and then shipped to the six participating laboratories. To investigate two different scoring strategies, cell cultures were set up with short term (2\u20133\u00a0h) or long term (24\u00a0h) colcemid treatment. Three classifiers for automatic dicentric detection were applied, two of which were developed specifically for these two different culture techniques. The automation procedure included metaphase finding, capture of cells at high resolution and detection of dicentric candidates. The automatically detected dicentric candidates were then evaluated by a trained human scorer, which led to the term \u2018semi-automated\u2019 being applied to the analysis.The six participating laboratories established at least one semi-automated calibration curve each, using the appropriate classifier for their colcemid treatment time. There was no significant difference between the calibration curves established, regardless of the classifier used. The ratio of false positive to true positive dicentric candidates was dose dependent. The total staff effort required for analysing 150 metaphases using the semi-automated approach was 2\u00a0min as opposed to 60\u00a0min for manual scoring of 50 metaphases.Semi-automated dicentric scoring is a useful tool in a large scale radiation accident as it enables high throughput screening of samples for fast triage of potentially exposed individuals. Furthermore, the results from the participating laboratories were comparable which supports networking between laboratories for this assay.",

Furthermore, for emergency response, the DCA has been adapted for triage by simplifying the scoring method [1]. With the development of new technologies such as the imaging flow cytometer, it may now be possible to adapt this microscope-based method to an automated cytometry method. This technology allows the sensitivity of microscopy to be maintained while adding the increased throughput of flow cytometry. A new protocol is being developed to adapt the DCA to the imaging cytometer in order to further increase the rapid determination of a biological dose.Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from ex vivo irradiated whole blood samples using a density gradient separation method and cultured with PHA and Colcemid. After 48\u00a0h incubation, the chromosomes were isolated, stained for DNA content with propidium iodide (PI) and labelled with a centromere marker. Stained chromosomes were then analyzed on the ImageStream\u00d7 (EMD-Millipore, Billerica, MA).Preliminary results indicate that individual chromosomes can be identified and mono- and dicentric chromosomes can be differentiated by imaging cytometry. A dose response curve was generated using this technology. The details of the method and the dose response curve are presented and compared to traditional microscope scoring.Imaging cytometry is a new technology which enables the rapid, automated analysis of fluorescently labelled chromosomes. Adapting the dicentric assay to this technology has the potential for high throughput analysis for mass casualty events.",

Due to an inhibitory effect of radiation on cell proliferation the assay yields satisfactory results only when the absorbed dose is below about 5\u00a0Gy. In 2002 M\u00fcller and Rode suggested that a modified version of the test, based on the analysis of the ratio of trinucleated to tetranucleated cells and the frequency of micronuclei (Mn) in binucleated cells containing at least one Mn, can be applied to detect a dose reaching 15\u00a0Gy (Mutat. Res. 502 (2002) 47\u201351). Their conclusion was based on the results of experiments with lymphocytes from one donor and nothing is known about the possible influence of individual variability on the applicability of the Mn test to detect high doses of radiation. The aim of the present study was to validate the modified micronucleus assay with lymphocytes of 5 donors. Their blood was exposed to 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20\u00a0Gy of 60Co gamma rays. The levels of Mn and of cell proliferation were assessed using various approaches. A strong inter-individual variability was observed for all endpoints.

The model is based on a plethora of published information on biochemical modification of DSB induced by ionizing radiation. So far, three main DSB repair pathways have been identified, including nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR), and microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). During G1 and early S phases of the cell cycle, NHEJ and MMEJ repair pathways are activated dependent on the type of double strand breaks. Simple DSB are a substrate for NHEJ, while complex DSB and DSB in heterochromatin require further end processing. Repair of all DSB start with NHEJ presynaptic processes, and depending on the type of DSB pursue simple ligation, further end processing prior to ligation, or resection. Using law of mass action the model is translated into a mathematical formalism. The solution of the formalism provides the step by step and overall repair kinetics. The overall repair kinetics are compared with the published experimental measurements. Our calculations are in agreement with the experimental results and show that the complex types of DSBs are repaired with slow repair kinetics. The G1 and early S phase model could be employed to predict the kinetics of DSB repair for damage induced by high LET radiation.",

     "abstract": "A computational model of radiation-induced chromosome aberrations in human cells within the PARTRAC Monte Carlo simulation framework is presented. The model starts from radiation-induced DNA damage assessed by overlapping radiation track structures with multi-scale DNA and chromatin models, ranging from DNA double-helix in atomic resolution to chromatin fibre loops, heterochromatic and euchromatic regions, and chromosome territories. The repair of DNA double-strand breaks via non-homologous end-joining is followed. Initial spatial distribution and complexity, diffusive motion, enzymatic processing, synapsis and ligation of individual DNA ends from the breaks are simulated. To enable scoring of different chromosome aberration types resulting from improper joining of DNA fragments, the repair module has been complemented by tracking the chromosome origin of the ligated fragments and the positions of centromeres. The modelled motion of DNA ends has sub-diffusive characteristics and corresponds to measured chromatin mobility within time-scales of a few hours. The calculated formation of dicentrics after photon and \u03b1-particle irradiation in human fibroblasts is compared to experimental data (Cornforth et al., 2002, Radiat Res 158, 43). The predicted yields of dicentrics overestimate the measurements by factors of five for \u03b3-rays and two for \u03b1-particle irradiation. Nevertheless, the observed relative dependence on radiation dose is correctly reproduced. Calculated yields and size distributions of other aberration types are discussed. The present work represents a first mechanistic approach to chromosome aberrations and their kinetics, combining full track structure simulations with detailed models of chromatin and accounting for the kinetics of DNA repair.",

Quantitative HPLC analysis of phenolic acids and flavonoids in the methanol extract of C. coggygria showed that myricetin was a major component. To test the hepatoprotective effect, a non-genotoxic dose of the C. coggygria extract and an equivalent amount of synthetic myricetin, as present in the extract, were applied either 2 or 12\u00a0h prior to administration of 100\u00a0mg/kg bw of pyrogallol. The extract and myricetin promoted restoration of hepatic function by significantly reducing pyrogallol-induced elevation in the serum enzymes AST, ALT, ALP and in total bilirubin. As measured by the decrease in total score and tail moment, the DNA damage in liver was also reduced by the extract and by myricetin. Our results suggest that pro-surviving Akt activity and STAT3 protein expression play important roles in decreasing DNA damage and in mediating hepatic protection by the extract.

Molecular pathogenesis of PLC is known to be especially sensitive to ethno-environmental variations that modulate mutation spectra in tumours. Despite a high prevalence of chronic liver diseases, the molecular epidemiology of PLC is still poorly known in Russia. To characterize the major genetic features of liver tumours in Russian populations, we conducted a pilot study on 34 PLC cases (28 hepatocellular, two cholangiocellular, and four mixed cases) among patients attending the Radiology and Roentgenology Hospital in Saint Petersburg. Point mutations were searched in 9 genes that are commonly altered in PLC, viz. TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1, H/K/N-RAS, BRAF, PTEN, and NFE2L2. The genes TP53 and AXIN1 were mutated in 16% and 10% of the cases, respectively, whereas mutations of \u03b2-catenin were present in only 7% of samples, an unusual situation for Europe but common in East Asia. No R249S mutation indicative of exposure to aflatoxin B1 was detected in TP53. A single case harboured an NFE2L2 mutation. The loss of chromosome 18q was associated with early onset of tumours (mean 50 vs 62\u00a0yrs, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0252) and with the patient's place of birth in Caucasus or Siberia. A lack of any risk factor was noted in 47% of the patients, whereas only 23% of the patients were infected either by hepatitis virus B or C.

     "abstract": "A repeat-dose micronucleus assay in adult rat liver was recently developed [Mutat. Res. 747 (2012) 234\u2013239]. This assay demonstrated a high detectability of hepatocarcinogens at relatively low doses, as indicated by dose-dependent micronucleus induction. Because the adult rat liver is known to have a long life-span, this desirable property of the assay will be an advantage in detecting micronucleated hepatocytes (MNHEPs) that have persisted for long periods in the liver following repeated dosing. However, no data directly supporting the underlying mechanisms have been published to date. In the present study, we verified the mechanisms by means of pulse-labeling of micronucleated hepatocytes with the thymidine analog 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU). The rodent hepatocarcinogen diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was repeatedly administered orally to male Crl:CD (SD) rats (6 weeks old) for up to 2 weeks, and EdU was injected intraperitoneally on days 1, 7, or 14. Hepatocytes were isolated by use of a non-perfusion technique at 24\u00a0h, 1 week, or 2 weeks after EdU injection and analyzed for EdU incorporation and micronucleus formation. The results of our study confirmed that MNHEPs labeled with EdU on the first day of DEN administration persisted until 2 weeks post-administration in the rat livers. However, the frequency of MHNEPs among EdU-labeled hepatocytes decreased over time. In addition, the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the liver tissue increased, suggesting selective removal of micronucleated cells. Theoretical calculation of the cumulative MNHEP frequency on each of the days on which DEN was administered, taking into account the rate of loss, came out closer to the actual value observed in the liver micronucleus test. Taken together, these results indicate that although micronucleated cells induced in rat livers by administration of the genotoxic hepatocarcinogen DEN undergo selective removal, they persist for a long time in a certain proportion, and repeated administration results in their accumulation and increased frequency.",

     "abstract": "The Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cell-transformation assay (SHE assay) is a promising alternative method to animal testing for the identification of potential carcinogens in vitro. Prior to conducting the SHE assay the appropriate concentration range for each test chemical must be established, with a maximum concentration causing approximately 50% cytotoxicity. Concentration range-finding is done in separate experiments, which are similar to the final SHE assay but with less replicates and more concentrations. Here we present an alternative for the cytotoxicity testing by miniaturization of the test procedure by use of 24-well plates and surpluses from feeder-cell preparations as target cells. In addition, we integrated the photometry-based neutral red (NR) assay. For validation of the assay, incubations with dimethyl sulf-oxide, p-phenylenediamine\u20132HCl, aniline, o-toluidine\u2013HCl, 2,4-diaminotoluene, and 2-naphthylamine were carried out in the miniaturized approach and compared with the standard procedure in terms of calculating the relative plating efficiencies (RPEs). To directly compare both methods, concentrations that produced 50% cytotoxicity (IC50) were calculated. Excellent associations were observed between the number of colonies and NR uptake. For all test substances a concentration-dependent, concomitant decrease of NR uptake in the miniaturized approach and RPEs in the standard test was observed after a 7-day incubation. The results from both test setups showed a comparable order of magnitude and the IC50 values differed by a factor <2 (1.4\u20131.9), depending on the substance in question. Overall, the miniaturized approach should be considered an improved alternative for cytotoxicity testing in the SHE assay, as it saves valuable SHE cells and speeds-up the time, to obtain test results more rapidly.",

However, this does not account for all the inter-individual variability seen among patients. In order to assess whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the OGG1 and XPC genes, both implicated in responses to oxidative stress, are associated with the age of onset of HD, 9 SNPs have been genotyped in 299 individuals with HD and 582 controls. After correction for multiple testing, two OGG1/XPC haplotypes were found to be associated with younger age at onset independently of the number of CAG repeats within the HTT gene. Both haplotypes contain XPC coding variants that would be expected to impact on protein function and/or variants in the 3\u2032UTR that could result in altered protein levels via allele-specific mIR binding. One haplotype also contains the OGG1-326Cys (rs1052133) allele that has been associated with a lower 8-oxoG repair activity and is particularly sensitive to the cellular redox status.

     "abstract": "The possible genotoxicity of the total particulate matter (TPM) in cigarette smoke has typically been evaluated using the in vitro micronucleus assay. In recent years, automated scoring techniques have been developed to replace the manual counting process in this assay. However, these automated scoring techniques have not been applied in routine genotoxicity assays for the analysis of TPM to improve the assay efficiency. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were treated with TPM produced from 14 types of cigarettes at five concentrations (25\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) without exogenous metabolic activation. The three following methods were used to score the micronucleus (MN) frequency: (a) flow cytometry with SYTOX and EMA dyes, which differentially stain micronuclei and apoptotic/necrotic chromatin to enhance assay reliability; (b) laser scanning cytometry with FITC and PI dyes, which is a system that combines the analytical capabilities of flow and image cytometry; and (c) visual microcopy with Giemsa dye. The test results obtained using the three methods were compared using correlation analysis. The key findings for this set of compounds include the following: (a) both flow cytometry- and laser scanning cytometry-based methods were effective for MN identification, (b) the three scoring methods could detect dose-dependent micronucleus formation for the 14 types of TPM, and (c) the MN frequencies that were measured in the same samples by flow cytometry, laser scanning cytometry, and visual microscopy were highly correlated, and there were no significant differences (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In conclusion, both flow cytometry and laser scanning cytometry can be used to evaluate the MN frequency induced by TPM without exogenous metabolic activation. The simpler and faster processing and the high correlation of the results make these two automatic methods appropriate tools for use in in vitro micronucleus assays for the analysis of TPM using CHO cells.",

In this study five laboratories participated in a collaborative trial that evaluated the transferability and reproducibility of a rat Pig-a assay that uses a HIS49 antibody reacts with an antigen found on erythrocytes and erythroid progenitors. In preliminary work, flow cytometry methods were established that enabled all laboratories to detect CD59-negative erythrocyte frequencies (Pig-a mutant frequencies) of <10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 in control rats. Four of the laboratories (the in-life labs) then treated male rats with a single oral dose of N-nitroso-N-ethylurea, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), or 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO). Blood samples were collected up to 4 weeks after the treatments and analyzed by flow cytometry for the frequency of CD59-negative cells among total red blood cells (RBCs; RBC Pig-a assay). RBC Pig-a assays were conducted in the four in-life laboratories, plus a fifth laboratory that received blood samples from the other laboratories. In addition, three of the five laboratories performed a Pig-a assay on reticulocytes (RETs; PIGRET assay), using blood from the rats treated with DMBA and 4NQO. The four in-life laboratories detected consistent, time- and dose-related increases in RBC Pig-a mutant frequency (MF) for all three test articles. Furthermore, comparable results were obtained in the fifth laboratory that received blood samples from other laboratories. The three laboratories conducting the PIGRET assay also detected consistent, time- and dose-related increases in Pig-a MF, with the RET MFs increasing more rapidly with time than RBC MFs. These results indicate that rat Pig-a assays using a HIS49 antibody were transferable between laboratories and that data generated by the assays were reproducible. The findings also suggest that the PIGRET assay may detect the in vivo mutagenicity of test compounds earlier than the RBC Pig-a assay.",

Here we analyzed and compared spontaneous and etoposide-induced DNA damage in HepG2 (\u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP)-positive) and Chang Liver (AFP-negative) cell lines. Compared to Chang Liver cells, HepG2 cells exhibited a significantly higher degree of micronucleation and a higher nuclear division index, as determined by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay, following exposure to etoposide. HepG2 cells were also more resistant to etoposide-induced cytotoxicity compared to Chang Liver cells. We also establish that increased etoposide-induced multinucleation in HepG2 cells is dependent on the catalytic activity of Akt, as phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase inhibitors as well as the overexpression of kinase-defective Akt reversed this phenotype. Moreover, ectopic expression of wild type PTEN reduced the frequency of etoposide-induced multinucleated HepG2 cells, and restored HepG2 etoposide sensitivity. Taken together, these results implicate the Akt/PTEN cellular axis as a major determinant of the etoposide resistance of HCC cells.",

In the present study, our aim was to demonstrate the characteristics of the glandular stomach and colon MN tests by analyzing time-related changes in MN frequencies, apoptosis and cell proliferation in the target tissues of male CD (SD) rats that were orally administered a single dose of a stomach- or colon-targeted carcinogen, i.e., N-nitroso-N-methylurea (MNU) or N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) for the stomach and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (DMH) for the colon. After treatment, the MN frequencies significantly increased in the respective target tissues, peaking at 48\u201396\u00a0h and decreasing afterwards. The time-response pattern could be explained by the epithelial cell turnover confirmed with a labeling experiment using the thymidine analog, 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU). In the study with MNU and DMH, we also prepared paraffin sections of the respective target tissues for the immunohistochemical evaluation of apoptosis and cell proliferation. The incidence of apoptosis increased in the early phase (6 and/or 24\u00a0h) after treatment, and then decreased. Cell proliferation was depressed when a high incidence of apoptosis was observed, and then it recovered until 72\u00a0h. MN frequencies increased with the recovery of cell proliferation occurring later than the peak apoptosis response. These results indicated that micronuclei were induced in the glandular stomach and colon epithelial cells by administration of the model chemicals.On the other hand, MNU induced significant increases of MNed cells in both the glandular stomach and bone marrow in the same rats, while MNNG did only in the glandular stomach when administered orally up to 1/4 of the LD50.These results suggest that the glandular stomach- and colon-MN tests would be useful for evaluating the genotoxicity of agents in the gastrointestinal tract.",

The testes of male mice subjected to whole body irradiation with carbon ion beam (0.5 and 4\u00a0Gy) were analyzed at 7\u00a0days after irradiation. A two-dimensional gel electrophoresis approach was employed to investigate the alteration of protein expression in the testes. Spot detection and matching were performed using the PDQuest 8.0 software. A difference of more than threefold in protein quantity (normalized spot volume) is the standard for detecting differentially expressed protein spots. A total of 11 differentially expressed proteins were found. Protein identification was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-TOF). Nine specific proteins were identified by searching the protein sequence database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information. These proteins were found involved in molecular chaperones, metabolic enzymes, oxidative stress, sperm function, and spermatogenic cell proliferation. HIR decreased glutathione activity and increased malondialdehyde content in the testes. Given that Pin1 is related to the cell cycle and that proliferation is affected by spermatogenesis, we analyzed testicular histological changes and Pin1 protein expression through immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. Alterations of multiple pathways may be associated with HIR toxicity to the testes. Our findings are essential for studies on the development, biology, and pathology of mouse testes after HIR in space or radiotherapy.",

The pBR322 plasmid DNA gets damaged by radiation in which the supercoiled form gradually disappears with increasing radiation dose. Diclofenac sodium has shown its radioprotective potential by scavenging radiation induced free radicals which are depicted by its ability in restoring the fraction of supercoiled form of plasmid DNA back to normal. 250\u00a0\u03bcM concentration of the drug provides GSSB yield of 3.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129\u00a0Da\u22121\u00a0Gy\u22121.

Among several mechanisms of arsenic-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity studied so far, role of arsenic in impairment of immune system is less understood. Epidemiological data, animal model as well as cell line based studies have indicated that arsenic targets immune system and is associated with characteristic immunosupression, which may further adversely affect respiratory function. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no study with respect to arsenic susceptibility investigating the role of genetic variation having immunological function. Hence, we have recruited a total of 432 arsenic-exposed individuals, of which 219 individuals with characteristic arsenic-induced skin lesions (cases) and 213 individuals without arsenic-induced skin lesion(controls), from arsenic-exposed districts of West Bengal, India. To find any probable association between arsenicism and the exonic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NALP2 gene, an important component of inflammasome complex, we screened the entire coding region (exon) in all the study participants. Among 9 SNPs found in NALP2 gene, the A1052E polymorphism (at least with one minor allele), was significantly overrepresented in controls and hence implies decreased risk toward the development of skin lesions [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.67, 95% CI: 0.46\u20130.97]. Since, development of non-dermatological health effects are also important factor to properly look into, we have attempted to correlate the genetic variation of NALP2 with the extent of cytogenetic damage as measured by chromosomal aberration assay and adverse health effects including peripheral neuropathy, eye problem and respiratory diseases in the study population. We observed individuals with the protective genotype had less chromosomal aberration (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and were also less susceptible toward arsenic-related respiratory diseases [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.47; 95%CI: 0.23\u20130.89].

Diabetes was induced by injecting a single dose of streptozotocin (STZ), (55\u00a0mg/kg) dissolved in ice-cold 10\u00a0mM citrate buffer; pH 4.4 and administered i.p. immediately after preparation to the SD rats. At the end of the study, rats were sacrificed and the levels of nitrite, superoxide, malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (reduced and peroxidase) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were measured. Germ cell toxicity was evaluated by using sperm count, sperm comet assay, histology of testes and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Further to confirm the oxidative and nitrosative damage, immunohistological quantification of 8-oxo-dG (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine) and 3-nitrotyrosine were evaluated respectively. Results showed that telmisartan significantly restored the levels of nitrite, superoxide, malondialdehyde, and glutathione and superoxide dismutase in diabetic testes. Further, telmisartan significantly increased the sperm counts, reduced apoptotic cell death, sperm DNA damage, oxidative and nitrosative damage in diabetic rat. Western blot analysis showed that telmisartan reduced the testicular inflammation and cell death by down-regulating the expression of NF-\u03baB, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, p-ERK1/2, iNOS, caspase-3 and increasing the PPAR-\u03b3 expression.

Given the previously described essential roles of p38 MAPK and JNK pathways in HepG2 cells, we undertook the present study to investigate the roles of p38 MAPK and JNK pathways in cell cycle arrest of HepG2 cells stimulated with FZD. Here we reported that FZD could obviously induce S phase cell cycle arrest, suppress cell growth, increase the activity of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), and decrease the activity of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK) in HepG2 cells. Simultaneously, inhibition of p38 MAPK pathway could significantly reduce FZD-stimulated S phase cell cycle arrest, active cell growth, decrease the activity of p-p38, and increase the activity of p-JNK. To the opposite, inhibition of JNK pathway could significantly increase FZD-stimulated S phase cell cycle arrest, suppress cell growth, decrease the activity of p-JNK, and increase the activity of p-p38. These results demonstrate that JNK and p38 MAPK pathways have opposite roles in FZD-stimulated S phase cell cycle arrest of HepG2 cells. FZD induces S phase cell cycle arrest and suppresses cell proliferation of HepG2 cells via activating the pathway from p38 to p-p38 and inhibiting the pathway from JNK to p-JNK.",

Antimutagenicity of these compounds was assessed by the Ames test and RNA polymerase B (rpoB)-based rifampicin resistance assay. Antioxidant potential was evaluated by radical scavenging assays and reducing power measurement. Protection of cells and DNA against gamma radiation-induced oxidative damage was assayed by survival analysis and gel electrophoresis profiling, respectively. On the 1,4-naphthoquinone nucleus, plumbagin possesses 5-hydroxyl and 2-methyl functional groups, whereas juglone has only the 5-hydroxyl and menadione only the 2-methyl group. Plumbagin showed strong antimutagenic (against ultraviolet and ethyl methanesulfonate) and antioxidant activities, whereas juglone displayed only strong antimutagenic, and menadione only strong antioxidant activities. Thus, these two functional groups (5-OH/2-CH3) play important roles in the differential bioactivity of naphthoquinones. Escherichia coli, microarray analysis showed upregulation of the genes rep (replication/repair), ybaK (tRNA editing), speE (spermidine synthesis), and yjfC (glutathionyl spermidine synthesis) by plumbagin or juglone, and sodC (superoxide dismutase), xthA (oxidative repair), hycB (electron carrier between hydrogenase 3 and fumarate dehydrogenase), and ligA (formation of phosphodiester bond in DNA) by plumbagin or menadione. Studies with E. coli single-gene knockouts showed that ybaK and speE, reported to prevent mistranslation, are likely to be involved in the antimutagenicity displayed by juglone, and sodC to be involved in the antioxidant activity of menadione.",

Here we studied how common polymorphisms of the genes XPD (Asp312Asn and Lys751Gln), APE1 (Asp148Glu), XRCC1 (Arg399Gln), and NBS1 (Gln185Glu) influence DNA repair and other responses after X-irradiation of lymphocytes from colon carcinoma patients. Genotypes with polymorphic Asp148Glu APE1 and Asp312Asn XPD showed a significantly higher level of DNA incisions immediately after irradiation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.047 respectively) and Asp312Asn XPD showed a significantly increased capacity to repair of DNA strand breaks as measured 180\u00a0min after irradiation by comet assays (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). In contrast, it was the wild type XRCC1 genotype which was associated with a lower level of DNA breaks after irradiation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014, at 180\u00a0min after irradiation) and polymorphism of NBS1 did not correlate with any changes in DNA breaks or repair capacity.To confirm the influence of XPD polymorphism on repair, we established stably-transfected HCT116 (colon carcinoma) cells which over-expressed the wild-type or variant XPD protein. Cells over-expressing Asp312Asn XPD showed a higher level of DNA breaks shortly after irradiation and more efficient repair than cells over-expressing the wild-type gene XPD312Asp, and an earlier inhibition of cell cycle transit but faster recovery from this inhibition. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes therefore influence not only DNA repair capacity but also cell proliferation, and may serve as markers of individual repair capacity and susceptibility to environmental and occupational carcinogens.",

Previous studies of atomic-bomb survivors revealed that somatic mutations at the glycophorin A (GPA) gene locus in erythrocytes were significantly elevated with radiation exposure dose, and that the dose response was significantly higher in survivors with subsequent cancer development compared to those without cancer development. Noteworthy in these studies were great inter-individual differences in GPA mutant fraction even in persons with similar radiation doses. It is hypothesized that persistent GPA mutations in erythrocytes of atomic-bomb survivors are derived from those in long-lived hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) populations, and that individual genetic backgrounds, specifically related to DNA double-strand break repair, contribute to individual differences in HSC mutability following radiation exposure. Thus, we examined the relationship between radiation exposure, GPA mutant fraction in erythrocytes, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the key gene involved in DNA double-strand break repair, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1). 53BP1 SNPs and inferred haplotypes demonstrated a significant interaction with radiation dose, suggesting that radiation-dose response of GPA somatic mutation is partly dependent on 53BP1 genotype. It is also possible that 53BP1 plays a significant role in DNA double-strand break repair in HSCs following radiation exposure.",

A significant increase of the number hybridization sites was observed in fish exposed to 30\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0U/L and 100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0U/L and hyperoxia.

Here, we report that BPDE (the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of the PAH benzo[a]pyrene) treatment triggers a variable extent of inhibition of DNA synthesis/cell growth, which does not correspond to the extent of increased p53 accumulation. BPDE treatment of cells significantly attenuates expression of p34cdc2, a cell cycle activating protein. Although the role of cdc2 down-regulation in inhibition of cell cycle progression is well known, cdc2 down-regulation in response to cellular insult by PAHs has not been reported. Unlike p53 accumulation, there is a correspondence between DNA synthesis/cell growth inhibition and cdc2 down-regulation by BPDE. BPDE-induced cdc2 down-regulation is p53 dependent, although there is no correspondence between p53 accumulation and cdc2 down-regulation. BPDE-induced cdc2 down-regulation corresponded with accumulation of the cell cycle inhibitor protein p21 (transactivation product of p53). DNA synthesis/cell growth inhibition in response to DNA-damaging PAHs may involve down-regulation of cdc2 protein mediated by p53 activation (transactivation ability), and the extent of p53 accumulation is not the sole determining factor in this regard.",

Three individuals died and the farmer's 19-weeks-pregnant wife suffered acute radiation symptoms. Conventional chromosome analysis, cytokinesis-block micronuclei (CBMN) assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) painting with three pairs of whole chromosome probes were used to analyze chromosomal aberrations for the pregnant female and her baby during the 16 years following the accident. The yields of dicentrics and rings (dic\u00a0+\u00a0r) continually declined between 41 days and 16 years after the accident. The frequency of binucleated MN also decreased over time for both mother and daughter. Sixteen years after exposure, the yields of dic\u00a0+\u00a0r and binucleated MN decreased to normal levels, but the reciprocal translocation frequencies remained elevated, for both mother and daughter. FISH results showed a decreasing yield of translocations with time. Based on the changes in maternal translocation frequency, the daughter's dose at the time of exposure was estimated as 1.82 (1.35\u20132.54)\u00a0Gy. This was consistent with the clinical manifestations of severe mental retardation and low IQ score. FISH-based translocation analysis can be used for follow-up studies on accidental exposure and, after correction, for retrospective dose estimation for individuals prenatally exposed to radiation.",

This classification gives information on the mechanistic properties of chemicals and is indispensable for setting the threshold safety margins for genotoxicity in pharmaceutical development. A widely used method for detecting aneugens is fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) but, even though the rat is an experimental animal generally used in preclinical studies in drug development, DNA probes that hybridize to all the centromeres of rat chromosomes have not yet been established. In the present study, in addition to the previously known satellite I sequence, we identified two novel satellite sequences, satellite II and satellite III, from the rat genome database. DNA probes with a mixture of these satellite DNA sequences were used to establish a FISH method for pan-centromeric staining of rat chromosomes. To confirm the feasibility of the method, vinblastine (VBS) and mitomycin C (MMC) were administered to rats as a typical aneugen and clastogen, respectively. Micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) from bone marrow were enriched by sorting in flow cytometry and subjected to the FISH method. As a result, the ratio of centromere-positive MNPCE increased in VBS-treated rats but not in MMC-treated ones. Since the FISH method using the novel DNA probes clearly discriminates the aneugens from the clastogens, we suggest this method as a useful tool for providing mechanistic information for micronucleus induction in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Some studies suggest that genotoxic effects of combustion-related aerosols are induced by carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (c-PAHs) and their derivatives, which are part of the organic fraction of the particulate matter (PM) in ambient air. The proportion of the organic fraction in PM is known to vary with particle size. The ultrafine fraction is hypothesized to be the most important carrier of c-PAHs, since it possesses the highest specific surface area of PM. To test this hypothesis, the distribution of c-PAHs in organic extracts (EOMs) was compared for four size fractions of ambient-air aerosols: coarse (1\u00a0<\u00a0dae\u00a0<\u00a010\u03bcm), upper (0.5\u00a0<\u00a0dae\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0\u03bcm), and lower (0.17\u00a0<\u00a0dae\u00a0<\u00a00.5\u00a0\u03bcm) accumulation aerosol particles and ultrafine particles (dae\u00a0<\u00a00.17). High-volume aerosol samples were collected consecutively in four localities that differed in the level of environmental pollution. The genotoxicity of EOMs was measured by analysis of DNA adducts induced in an a cellular assay consisting of calf thymus DNA with/without rat liver microsomal S9 fraction coupled with 32P-postlabelling. The upper accumulation fraction was the major size fraction in all four localities, forming 37\u201346% of the total PM mass. Per m3 of sampled air, this fraction also bound the largest amount of c-PAHs. Correspondingly, the upper accumulation fraction induced the highest DNA-adduct levels. Per PM mass itself, the lower accumulation fraction is seen to be the most efficient in binding DNA-reactive organic compounds. Interestingly, the results suggest that the fraction of ultrafine particles of various ambient-air samples is neither a major carrier of c-PAHs, nor a major inducer of their genotoxicity, which is an important finding that is relevant to the toxicity and health effects of ultrafine particles, which are so extensively discussed these days.",

To evaluate the tumor-site-specific genotoxicity and cytotoxicity of SDD in the mouse small intestine, tissue pathology and cytogenetic damage were evaluated in duodenal crypt and villus enterocytes from B6C3F1 mice exposed to 0.3\u2013520\u00a0mg/L SDD in drinking water for 7 and 90 days. Allele-competitive blocker PCR (ACB-PCR) was used to investigate the induction of a sensitive, tumor-relevant mutation, specifically in vivo K-Ras codon 12 GAT mutation, in scraped duodenal epithelium following 90 days of drinking water exposure. Cytotoxicity was evident in the villus as disruption of cellular arrangement, desquamation, nuclear atypia and blunting. Following 90 days of treatment, aberrant nuclei, occurring primarily at villi tips, were significantly increased at \u226560\u00a0mg/L SDD. However, in the crypt compartment, there were no dose-related effects on mitotic and apoptotic indices or the formation of aberrant nuclei indicating that Cr(VI)-induced cytotoxicity was limited to the villi. Cr(VI) caused a dose-dependent proliferative response in the duodenal crypt as evidenced by an increase in crypt area and increased number of crypt enterocytes. Spontaneous K-Ras codon 12 GAT mutations in untreated mice were higher than expected, in the range of 10\u22122 to 10\u22123; however no treatment-related trend in the K-Ras codon 12 GAT mutation was observed. The high spontaneous background K-Ras mutant frequency and Cr(VI) dose-related increases in crypt enterocyte proliferation, without dose-related increase in K-Ras mutant frequency, micronuclei formation, or change in mitotic or apoptotic indices, are consistent with a lack of genotoxicity in the crypt compartment, and a MOA involving accumulation of mutations late in carcinogenesis as a consequence of sustained regenerative proliferation.",

Ni toxicity and its potential impact on aquatic organisms are, however, not well understood. This study used an integrated approach to evaluate genotoxic effects, tissue-specific accumulation and transcriptional profiles of key genes in mussels, Mytilus galloprovincialis, exposed to a range of concentrations of Ni. The genotoxic effects assessed were total and oxidative DNA damage (DNA strand breaks measured using the enzyme modified comet assay), and induction of micronuclei (MN; clastogenic and/or aneugenic effects) using haemocytes as the target cells. Six genes (pgp, mt10, mt20, sod, hsp70 and gst) were selected for transcriptional analysis in the gills based on their key role in the stress response. Following exposure to sublethal concentrations of Ni (0\u20133600\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121) for 5 days, mussel haemocytes showed significant genotoxicity at >1800\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 (4-fold increase for DNA strand breaks and 3-fold increase for MN induction). There was no significant difference between buffer (control) and enzyme treatments which target oxidised DNA bases (formamidopyrimidine glycosylase or endonuclease IIII). This suggested that, in haemocytes, oxidative DNA damage is not a major mechanism for Ni-induced genotoxicity. The expression of mt20 and gst genes in gill was up-regulated at genotoxic concentrations, whilst pgp expression was markedly up-regulated, particularly at 18\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121 Ni (19-fold increase). Pearson's correlation analysis revealed significant associations between % tail DNA and MN induction in haemocytes (r\u00a0=\u00a00.88, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and between Ni accumulation in foot (r\u00a0=\u00a00.47, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and digestive gland (r\u00a0=\u00a00.41, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and induction of MN in the haemocytes.

All of the adducts inhibited DNA synthesis by replicative DNA polymerases in E. coli; however, the extent of the inhibition varied among the adducts. All five dG-adducts strongly blocked replication by replicative DNA polymerases; however, the dA-adduct only weakly blocked DNA replication. The induction of the SOS response increased the frequency of TLS, which was higher for the dG-C8-C2-ABA, dG-C8-N-AcABA and dG-C8-C2-AcABA adducts than for the other adducts. In our previous study, dG-C8-N-ABA blocked DNA replication more strongly and induced mutations more frequently than dG-N2-C2-ABA in human cells. In contrast, in E. coli the frequency of TLS over dG-N2-C2-ABA was markedly reduced, even under the SOS+ conditions, and dG-N2-C2-ABA induced G to T mutations.

     "abstract": "The use of nanotechnology has led to rapid growth in various areas. Manganese oxide (MnO2) nanomaterials (NMs) are typically used for biomedical applications. However, characterizing the potential human health effects of MnO2 NMs is required before fully exploiting these materials. The aim of this study was to investigate the acute oral toxicity of MnO2 NMs and MnO2-bulk particles in female albino Wistar rats. The genotoxic effects were examined using comet, micronucleus and chromosomal aberration assays. Nanosized MnO2 (45\u00a0nm) significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) increased DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes and micronuclei and enhanced chromosomal aberrations in the bone marrow cells at 1000\u00a0mg/kg bw. These findings showed that the neurotoxicity of MnO2-45\u00a0nm in the brain and red blood cells, as determined through acetylcholinesterase activity, was significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) inhibited at 1000 and 500\u00a0mg/kg bw doses. MnO2-45\u00a0nm disrupted the physicochemical state and neurological system of the animals through alterations in ATPases via the total Na+\u2013K+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ levels in the brain P2 fraction. In addition, 500 and 1000\u00a0mg/kg bw doses of MnO2-45\u00a0nm caused significant changes in AST, ALT and LDH levels in the liver, kidney and serum of treated rats. Significant tissue distribution was found in all tissues in a dose- and time-dependent manner. MnO2-45\u00a0nm exhibited much higher absorptivity and tissue distribution compared with MnO2-bulk. A large fraction of MnO2-45\u00a0nm was cleared in the urine and feces. The histopathological analysis revealed that MnO2-45\u00a0nm caused alterations in the liver, spleen and brain. These findings will provide fundamental information regarding the potential toxicities and biodistribution of nano and bulk MnO2 generated through acute oral treatment.",

     "abstract": "Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was listed as one of the persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in Stockholm Convention in 2009. Recent evidence showed that PFOS could induce apoptosis both in vivo and in vitro. However, the apoptotic mechanisms induced by PFOS as well as the possible relationship between apoptosis and other PFOS-induced endpoints, remain unclear. In the present study, normal human\u2013hamster hybrid (AL) cells and mtDNA-depleted (\u03c10 AL) cells were exposed to PFOS, and assayed for cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and apoptosis (caspase-3/7, caspase-9 activities). Our results showed that PFOS decreased cell viability in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in AL cells, but not in \u03c10 AL cells. However, long-term exposure to PFOS failed to induce the mutagenic effects at the CD59 locus in AL cells. Exposure to 200 \u03bcM PFOS significantly increased the activities of caspase-3/7 and caspase-9 in AL cells, but the activities of these caspases were not affected in \u03c10 AL cells. In addition, PFOS increased the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide anion (O2\u2212), as well as nitric oxide (NO), and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) at the concentrations of 100 and 200\u00a0\u03bcM in AL cells. On the other hand, exposure to PFOS had no effect on intracellular ROS, O2\u2212, and NO production in \u03c10 AL cells. Caspase-3/7 activity, which was increased by 200 \u03bcM PFOS, could be suppressed by ROS/O2\u2212 scavengers and nitric oxide synthases (NOSs) inhibitors in AL cells. These results implicate that PFOS-induced apoptosis and oxidative stress is mediated by a mitochondrion-dependent pathway and that the induction of apoptosis might be a protective function against mutagenesis in AL cells exposed to PFOS.",

In the present study, we analyzed the interaction of radiation and metronidazole (MTZ) in inducing chromosome aberration (CA) and micronucleus (MN) in the bone marrow cells of Balb/C mice in vivo. Further, we evaluated the efficacy of vitamin C to reduce MTZ induced genotoxicity. We found that 10, 20 and 40\u00a0mg/kg of MTZ induced dose dependent increase in the frequency of CA (r\u00a0=\u00a00.9923, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) as well as MN (r\u00a0=\u00a00.9823, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in polychromatic erythrocytes. However, MTZ did not affect the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes to normochromatic erythrocytes indicating lack of cytotoxicity. Supplementation with vitamin C prior to MTZ treatment significantly reduced the frequency of CA (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) as well as MN (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Radiation (0.5\u00a0Gy) exposure prior to MTZ treatment produced a less than additive (for CA) to additive (for MN) effects. However, radiation exposure following MTZ treatment produced additive (for CA) and synergistic (for MN) effects. Further, vitamin C pre-treatment also reduced the genotoxicity indices following the combined treatment of MTZ and radiation. Our findings suggest that MTZ may sensitize bone marrow cells to radiation exposure and enhances genotoxicity.

Lymphocyte Hprt mutant frequencies also increased dose dependently in treated animals, and the Comet assay detected elevated levels of DNA damage in all the tissues evaluated.

Treatment with 1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL 3-NBA for 24\u00a0h induced the formation of 2835\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01509 dG-C8-N-ABA and 3373\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01173 dG-N2-C2-ABA per 107 dG and 877\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0330 dA-N6-C2-ABA per 107 dA in the cells. The cellular DNA repair system removed the dG-C8-N-ABA and dA-N6-C2-ABA adducts more efficiently than the dG-N2-C2-ABA adducts. After a 24-h repair period, 86.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.1% of the dG-N2-C2-ABA adducts remained, whereas only 51.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7% of the dG-C8-N-ABA adducts and 37.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7% of the dA-N6-C2-ABA adducts were present in the cells. We also evaluated the efficiency of bypasses across these three adducts and their mutagenic potency by introducing site-specific mono-modified plasmids into human cells. This translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) assay showed that dG-C8-N-ABA blocked DNA replication markedly (its replication frequency was 16.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7%), while the replication arrests induced by dG-N2-C2-ABA and dA-N6-C2-ABA were more moderate (their replication frequencies were 33.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2% and 43.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5%, respectively). Mutagenic TLS was observed more frequently in replication across dG-C8-N-ABA (30.6%) than in replication across dG-N2-C2-ABA (12.1%) or dA-N6-C2-ABA (12.1%).

However, no genotoxic effect was observed in the micronucleus test using V79 cells at the concentrations tested.

The present study aims at highlighting BER capacity of RTL-W1 and RTG-W1, two trout cell lines used in eco-genotoxicity studies. This is realized by following the kinetics of strand-break repair after a short exposure to model genotoxicants\u2013leading predominantly to BER-specific lesions\u2013by means of the standard alkaline and Fpg-modified comet assays. Results show that both cell lines efficiently repair single-strand breaks and base-alkylation damages within 4\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h, respectively. Then, the study shows that after minor modifications of the protocol, the cell extract-based BERc assay can be used to evaluate the base-incision capacity of the cell lines and its variation after exposure of the cells to a model inhibitor of BER (3-aminobenzamide) and to environmental contaminants such as cadmium and tributyltin.

Cells were cytologically scored for viability status, defined by the proportion of necrotic and apoptotic cells; mitotic status, corresponding to the proportion and ratios of mono-, bi- and multinucleated cells; the nuclear division index and chromosomal damage, determined by the presence of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges or nuclear buds of bi-nucleated cells.Ageing is positively associated with the frequency of cytogenetic biomarkers. The micronucleus frequency in females was significantly higher than the micronucleus frequency in males. The micronucleus frequency is positively associated with family history of cancer.Furthermore, it is positively correlated with smoking: the frequency is higher in male subjects with a smoking habit than in female smokers. However, alcohol is observed to decrease the frequency of apoptotic cells in human lymphocytes. The frequency of micronuclei was positively correlated with exposure to medication. Lastly, the frequency of nuclear buds and apoptotic and necrotic cells negatively correlated with exposure to radiation.",

Gene polymorphisms were investigated by PCR-RFLP. The Heidelberg Retinal Tomography (HRT) clinical parameters were also analyzed.The 399Arg/Gln genotype of the XRCC1 gene was associated with an increased risk for POAG (OR 2.50; 95% CI, 1.54\u20134.07, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0002). The 399Gln/Gln XRCC1 genotype may increase the risk for POAG progression according to clinical parameters such as cup/disk ratio (c/d) (OR 1.93; 95% CI, 1\u20133.73, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and Rim area (RA factor) (OR 3.88; 95% CI, 1.01\u201314.82, P\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

Our current study demonstrates an association between the 326Ser/Cys OGG1 gene polymorphism and the 326Cys allele of the OGG1 gene, and progression of POAG.

The aim of the present study is to perform a comparative analysis of these chromosomal damages observed with light microscopy (LM) and by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM). The kinds of aberrations scored by LM were substantially corrected by images at the ultrastructural level. The AFM analysis excluded 29.0% of gaps and 33.3% of fusion-type aberrations. On the other hand, AFM revealed the presence of aberrations that were not visible under the LM. This indicates that only AFM images would provide precise information about the real nature of chromosomal damages. The results of our study revealed that the \u2018real gaps\u2019 represented about 50% of all the gaps visible under LM. Excluded \u2018false gaps\u2019 were detected via AFM as breaks or decondensed chromosome regions. These results would support the statement that gaps must be included when testing genotoxicity. The ultrastructural analysis also confirmed the validity of using LM in the mouse bone-marrow chromosome aberration test, as a tool for detecting genotoxicity of chemicals in routine studies. When there is a need for precise evaluation of chromosome damage, only AFM images can provide information on specific genotoxic effects.",

Our aim was to study the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of acitretin \u2013 alone or in combination with PUVA or NBUVB \u2013 by performing studies with blood from patients with psoriasis vulgaris who were treated with acitretin, acitretin\u00a0+\u00a0PUVA or acitretin\u00a0+\u00a0NBUVB for 12 weeks, and in vitro studies with blood from healthy volunteers, which was incubated with acitretin at different concentrations.

Our results show that psoriatic patients treated with acitretin alone or with acitretin\u00a0+\u00a0NBUVB, did not show genotoxic effects. In addition, these therapies reduced the rate of proliferation and induced apoptosis and necrosis of lymphocytes; the same occurred with lymphocyte cultures incubated with acitretin (1.2\u201320\u00a0\u03bcM).

Using quantum dots (Qdots) of different sizes (Qdot-440\u00a0nm and Qdot-680\u00a0nm) as a model system, we studied the effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) thin-layer surface modification in attenuating Qdot-related cytotoxicity, genotoxicity perturbation and oxidative stress in a cellular system. We found that uncoated Qdots (U-Qdots) made of core/shell CdSe/ZnS could indeed induce cytotoxic effects, including the inhibition of cell growth. Also, both the neutral comet assay and \u03b3H2AX foci formation showed that U-Qdots caused significant DNA damage in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In contrast, results from cytotoxicity analysis and \u03b3H2AX generation indicate minimal impact on cells after exposure to PEG-coated Qdots. This lack of observed toxic effects from PEG-coated Qdots may be due to the fact that PEG-coating can inhibit ROS generation induced by U-Qdots. Based on these observations, we conclude that the genotoxicity of Qdots could be significantly decreased following proper surface modification, such as PEG encapsulation. In addition, PEG encapsulation may also serve as a general method to attenuate nanotoxicity for other nanoparticles.",

The aim of this work was to evaluate the cytogenetic damage induced by AA and GA in cultured human lymphocytes by use of the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay. Furthermore, this report addresses the role of individual genetic polymorphisms in key genes involved in detoxification and DNA-repair pathways (BER, NER, HRR and NHEJ) on the induction of SCE by GA. While AA induced the number of SCE/metaphase only slightly, especially for the highest concentration tested (2000\u00a0\u03bcM), GA markedly induced SCEs in a concentration-dependent manner up to concentrations of 750\u00a0\u03bcM, leading to an increase in SCEs of up to about 10-fold compared with controls. By combining DNA damage in GA-treated lymphocytes and data on polymorphisms, associations between the induction of SCEs with GSTP1 (Ile105Val) and GSTA2 (Glu210Ala) genotypes are suggested.",

Since micronucleated young polychromatic erythrocytes, MNPCE, are very few in number among the cells in peripheral blood, about one or two out of 100,000 erythrocytes, there is always a risk that other cells, doublets or crystals, by mistake will be classified as a MNPCE. With immunomagnetic separation of the very youngest erythrocytes \u2013 which are transferrin-positive (Trf\u00a0+\u00a0Ret) \u2013 prior to analysis, we have obtained an almost pure (>98%) Trf\u00a0+\u00a0Ret-population.

Thirty FVB mice were intraperitoneally injected with B[a]P. From the same blood samples collected from these mice, cells were prepared in the two different ways and analyzed in the flow-cytometer equipped with two lasers. The lowest dose of B[a]P that can be reliably determined without being overwhelmed by the estimated error was about the same for the two methods, about 7\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw, i.e. the immunomagnetic separation did not increase the sensitivity.

Inter-individual variation of the genotoxic effects was analyzed using two-way ANOVA. The correlation between doses for the means of smoker and non-smoker patients was calculated using the Pearson test. The results of this study may indicate the need to reduce the daily radiotherapy dose further to prevent genotoxic effects on non-target cells, thus improving safety. Furthermore, these results may indicate that the estimation of DNA damage following exposure to a gamma radiation, as measured by the comet assay in whole blood leukocytes, can be used to screen human populations for radiation-induced genetic damage at the molecular level.",

     "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) that has received particular attention because of its widespread distribution in humans. Due to its chemical similarity to diethylstilbestrol, which is carcinogenic to mammals, the possible genotoxicity of BPA has already largely been evaluated. However, the results are still inconclusive and controversial. To investigate the genotoxic effects of BPA in rat germ cells and the potential protective action of melatonin against these effects, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered BPA at a dose of 200\u00a0mg/kg body weight per day for ten consecutive days with or without melatonin pretreatment. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in the testes were evaluated. Subsequently, their spermatocytes were isolated, and DNA damage was assessed using an alkaline comet assay and the meiotic spread method. BPA administration did not significantly affect the weights of rats and their reproductive organs, and no alteration in sperm count was found. However, we demonstrated that BPA administration induced a significant increase in TBARS levels and a decrease in SOD activity that were concomitant with an increase in DNA migration within male germ cells and \u03b3H2AX foci formation on the autosomes of pachytene spermatocytes. Furthermore, a decrease in the proportion of 4C-cells was observed. These BPA effects were significantly alleviated by melatonin pretreatment. Nevertheless, the genotoxic effects of BPA were not accompanied by apoptosis in germ cells and morphological changes in the testes. These results indicate that BPA exposure may induce DNA damage accumulation in germ cells via oxidative stress. Moreover, melatonin may be a promising pharmacological candidate for preventing the potential genotoxicity of BPA following occupational or environmental exposure.",

The mechanisms leading to these cellular outcomes are not fully understood, however, it is has been proposed that induction of cell-cycle arrest might be a result of genotoxic stress. Despite the potential for genotoxic activity of this class of compounds, there are very few data available to provide evidence for this, either in vitro or in vivo. In this study, four HDACi, viz. trichostatin A, sodium butyrate, APHA compound 8 and apicidin, were tested in the human lymphoblastoid TK6 cell line-hosted GADD45a-GFP assay, which has high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of genotoxic carcinogens and in vivo genotoxicants. All four compounds produced positive genotoxicity results within the acceptable toxic dose range of the assay, with APHA compound 8 producing the weakest response. Taken alongside recent evidence demonstrating that GADD45a is not induced by non-genotoxic apoptogens, this study suggests that genotoxicity contributes to the anti-tumour activity of HDACi drugs.",

The increase in apoptosis was also associated with proteolytic activation of caspases, Bid cleavage, insertion of pro-apoptotic Bax into the mitochondria and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol. Furthermore, it was found that Bcl-2 overexpression markedly protected U937 cells from 7,8-DHF-induced apoptosis by restoring activation of caspases. In addition, 7,8-DHF treatment effectively activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and inhibitors of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38 MAPK, which significantly reduced 7,8-DHF-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our results indicate that the JNK and ERK pathways, and modulation of Bcl-2 family proteins were key regulators of apoptosis in response to 7,8-DHF in U937 cells.",

CSO-SA was also found to induce apoptosis and oxidative stress through the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells. Preincubation with the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) decreased the intracellular ROS level and alleviated the DNA damage in A549 cells. Expression levels of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), caspase-9 and caspase-3, markers of apoptosis, were significantly higher in CSO-SA treated cells. In conclusion, these results suggested significant genotoxicity of high doses of CSO-SA nanomicelles in vivo and in vitro.

Firstly, the effect of a range of S9 concentrations on micronucleus formation and cytotoxicity was investigated. Subsequently, the reproducibility and predictivity of the micronucleus assay on CHO-k1 cells was investigated with a set of four compounds. Then, a larger set of compounds (n\u00a0=\u00a044) was tested on CHO-k1 cells and inter-laboratory correlation was calculated. Finally, cellular imaging was compared with flow cytometry for in vivo assessment of micronucleus formation.The concentration of S9 had a significant impact on micronucleus formation and cytotoxicity. In addition, calculations of relative cell count (RCC) and cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI) showed to be complementary to cytotoxicity assessment. The CHO-k1 micronucleus assay correctly classified the four reference compounds, with a dose\u2013response relationship and low variability. Based on a larger set of compounds, the assay proved to be reliable with a sensitivity of 94% (n\u00a0=\u00a031) and a specificity of 85% (n\u00a0=\u00a013). A correlation coefficient of 97% was obtained when the lowest observable adverse effect levels (LOAELs) from our study were compared with those published by Diaz et al. (2007) [10].

Here, a genotoxic rodent hepatocarcinogen, 1,2-dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (1,2-DMH), and a genotoxic (Ames positive) noncarcinogen, 2,6-diaminotolunene (2,6-DAT), were administered orally to rats for up to 28 days, and liver samples were then examined in a repeated-dose liver micronucleus (MN) assay, and additionally tested in the bone marrow (BM) MN assay concurrently. We recently established a simple method to isolate hepatocytes without in situ liver perfusion procedures, and applied this method in the liver MN assay. As a result, 1,2-DMH increased the proportion of micronucleated hepatocytes in both a dose- and duration-dependent manner at relatively low-dose levels that are routinely used in repeated-dose toxicity studies. In contrast to 1,2-DMH, 2,6-DAT did not have a detectable effect. In addition to these two chemicals, two genotoxic rodent hepatocarcinogens, diethylnitrosamine and 2,4-diaminotoluene, which gave positive responses in the liver MN assay in our previous investigation [Narumi et al., Mutat. Res. 747 (2012) 234-239], were subjected to the BM MN assay and histopathological evaluation. All four test chemicals gave negative responses in the BM MN assay. Furthermore, the three hepatocarcinogens displayed hepatotoxicity, including hepatocellular hypertrophy and anisokaryosis, but no abnormal findings were observed in the liver of rats treated with 2,6-DAT. Taken together, the present results indicate that the liver MN assay is effective for predicting hepatocarcinogenicity and may be integrated into repeated-dose toxicity studies without disturbing routine examinations, such as histopathology. Furthermore, with repeat-dose treatment protocols, our findings indicate that the liver MN assay is superior to the BM MN assay for detecting genotoxic or carcinogenic chemicals in rats.",

In this work, human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human colon adenocarcinona (HT29) cell lines were used to represent endothelial and digestive-tract tissues, which are in direct contact to BPA in vivo. Our results demonstrate that BPA has cell-type differential effects. Notably, BPA concentrations commonly found in humans induce micronucleus formation and interfere with cell-division processes in endothelial cells, resulting in mitotic abnormalities. We also found that BPA induces up-regulation of two genes encoding proteins associated with chromosome segregation, namely CDCA8 (borealin/cell division cycle A8) and SGOL2 (shugoshin-like2). Taken together, the aneugenic effects observed in endothelial cells (HUVECs) substantiate increasing concerns about BPA exposure at levels currently detected in humans.",

     "abstract": "The role of the tobacco-alkaloid nicotine in tumour biology is widely discussed in the literature. Due to a strong capacity to induce angiogenesis, a pro-mutagenic potential in non-tumour and cancer cells, and a pro- and anti-apoptotic influence, nicotine seems to promote the growth of established tumours. However, results indicating DNA damage and genetic instability associated with nicotine have been contradictory thus far. A variety of markers and endpoints of genotoxicity are required to characterize the genotoxic potential of nicotine. Induction of DNA single- and double-strand breaks, the formation of micronuclei, and the induction of sister chromatid exchange and chromosome aberrations represent possible genotoxicological endpoints at different cellular levels.Human lymphocytes were exposed to nicotine concentrations between 1\u00a0\u03bcM and 1\u00a0mM for 24\u00a0h in vitro. The comet assay, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test, the chromosome aberration (CA) test, and the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test were then applied. Viability and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry in combination with the annexin V-propidium iodide staining test.In this test setting, no enhanced DNA migration was measured by the comet assay. An increase in the micronucleus frequency was detected at a concentration of 100\u00a0\u03bcM nicotine without affecting the frequency of apoptotic cells. A distinct genotoxic effect was determined by the CA test and the SCE test, with a significant increase in CA and SCE at a concentration of 1\u00a0\u03bcM. In the annexin V test, nicotine did not influence the proportion of apoptotic or necrotic cells.The current data indicating the induction of CA by nicotine underscore the necessity of ongoing investigations on the potential of nicotine to initiate mutagenesis and tumour promotion. Taking into account the physiological nicotine plasma levels in smokers or in nicotine-replacement therapy, particularly the long-term use of nicotine should be critically discussed.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, health protection by natural products has received considerable attention, and a multitude of nutraceuticals have been characterized and their use promoted. Dietary consumption of Cruciferous vegetables, rich in glucosinolates (GLs), and their myrosinase-mediated hydrolysis products isothiocyanates (ITCs), were associated with reductions in cancer risk. In this study, the chemo-preventive potential of sprout extract of Tuscan black cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. acephala subvar. Laciniata L.) (TBCSE), through modulation of the xenobiotic-metabolizing apparatus and antioxidant defenses, was investigated in Sprague-Dawley rat liver. TBCSE was administered either orally or intraperitoneally, at a dose of 15\u00a0mg/kg b.w., daily for twenty-one consecutive days, in the absence or presence of exogenous myrosinase, \u03b2-thioglucoside glucohydrolase (MYR), to distinguish the effects of intact GLs and ITCs, in the context of the extract. A complex, mild modulation pattern of P450-related monooxygenases was observed, mainly regarding CYP content (up to 36% loss), NADPH cytochrome (P450) c-reductase (up to 26% loss), CYP1A1 (up to 23% loss), but no evident distinctions among the effects of the extracts containing GLs or ITCs, were noted. In contrast, significant inductions of phase-II enzymes (up to 107% for UDP-glucuronosyl-transferase, and up to 36% for glutathione S-transferase) were recorded only where the GLs to ITCs conversion had occurred. A boosting effect on catalase (up to 38%), NAD(P)H:quinone reductase (up to 70%), glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase (up to 10%) was also recorded, suggesting an indirect antioxidant capacity of the extracts. Overall, the general phase-I inhibition, together with the up-regulation of detoxifying phase-II and antioxidant enzymes, exerted by the TBCSE supplementation, seem to be in line with the classical chemopreventive theory, but whether the addition of exogenous MYR is relevant, still remains to be clarified. These results are in support of the potential health-promoting application of TBCSE, as a nutraceutical.",

     "abstract": "DNA damage induced by benzene and its metabolites is thought of as an important mechanism underlying benzene genotoxicity in chronic benzene poisoning (CBP). Therefore, genetic variation in DNA repair genes may contribute to susceptibility to CBP in the exposed population. Since benzene-induced DNA damages include DNA adducts, we hypothesized that the polymorphisms of ERCC1 (Excision repair cross complementation group 1) and ERCC2/XPD (Excision repair cross complementation group 2/xeroderma pigmentosum group D) are associated with the risk of CBP. A case-control study involving 102 benzene-poisoned patients and 204 none-benzene-poisoned controls occupationally exposed to benzene was carried out in the Northeast region of China. The polymorphisms of codon 118 (rs11615) and C8092A (rs3212986) of ERCC1, codon 751 (rs13181), 312 (rs1799793) and 156 (rs238406) of ERCC2/XPD were genotyped by TaqMan\u00ae Real-time PCR. The results showed that individuals carrying the ERCC1 codon 118 TT genotype had an increased risk of CBP (ORadj\u00a0=\u00a03.390; 95%CI: 1.393\u20138.253; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) comparing with its CC genotype. After stratified by smoking, gender and exposure duration we found that the increased risk of CBP associated with the ERCC1 codon 118 TT genotype confined to nonsmokers (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.214; 95% CI: 1.359\u20137.601; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006), female (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.049; 95% CI: 1.235\u20137.529; P\u00a0=\u00a00.013) and exposure duration> 12 years (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.750; 95% CI: 1.041\u201313.513; P\u00a0=\u00a00.035). Since ERCC1 and ERCC2/XPD are both located on chromosome 19q13.3, haplotype analysis of all 5 SNPs was also conducted. However no correlations between the risks of CBP and other genotypes or haplotypes were found. Therefore, our findings suggest an important role of ERCC1 codon 118 polymorphisms for a biomarker to CBP in the Chinese occupational population.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the genotoxic and oxidative damage induced by chronic fluoride exposure on mammalian cells in vivo. For this purpose, the genotoxic potential was investigated in bone marrow cells by the micronucleus test, chromosome aberration assay and comet assay (DNA strand breaks). In addition, DNA damage was evaluated in soft tissues and organs like spleen, liver and kidney cells. The oxidative damage was assessed by selective biochemical parameters by the measurement of lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione (GSH), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) activity in liver. Adult Swiss albino male mice were exposed to sodium fluoride in drinking water at the concentrations of 4, 12 and 20\u00a0mg/L for 30 consecutive days. Control groups (vehicle and positive) were also included. Animals were sacrificed; bone marrow and soft tissue samples were collected and subjected to series of assays respectively. We observed that NaF exposure, at the various concentrations tested caused a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleus (MN) in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs), structural chromosome aberrations in bone marrow cells. With the exception of the spleen cells, DNA damage was observed in bone marrow cells as well as in kidney and liver cells. We found an increase in lipid peroxidation, and catalase activity as well as decrease in glutathione activity (GSH and GST) in liver of mice respectively which were exposed to sodium fluoride. In conclusion, the data obtained clearly documents that NaF exhibits genotoxic activity and enhanced oxidative damage in mouse model.",

Conventional chromosome aberration analysis and the CBMN assay, as well as a drug-induced PCC assay recently established by our group, were performed on peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from five victims after the accident. The biological doses were estimated by scoring dicentrics plus centric rings, micronuclei and PCC rings. A high dose\u2013effect curve and the nuclear division index (NDI) we previously established were used to estimate the dose received by victim A, the most highly affected victim of the five. The doses for the five victims (A, B, C, D and E) were 12.4, 3.4, 2.5, 2.1 and 2.2\u00a0Gy, respectively, estimated by scoring dicentrics plus rings in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Similar results were obtained by combining the CBMN and NDI (CBMN\u00a0+\u00a0NDI) assays and the PCC assay. The doses estimated by the three methods were in accordance with the clinical symptoms observed. The specific dicentric assay with a low background level may be a better indicator for biological dose evaluation than the CBMN and PCC assays. The high dose curve we established is reliable and could become a suitable supplement to traditional biodosimetry for dose estimation. The CBMN and drug-induced PCC assays are simple, rapid and accurate. The two methods reinforce and verify the results observed with chromosome aberration analysis.",

In the present study, we applied these candidate marker genes to rat hepatocarcinogens in the rat liver. qPCR analysis of 33 genes was conducted on liver samples from groups of 4 male 4-week-old F344 rats at 4 and 48\u00a0h after a single oral administration of chemicals [2 genotoxic hepatocarcinogens: diethylnitrosamine and 2,6-dinitrotoluene; a non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogen: di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate; and a non-genotoxic non-hepatocarcinogen: phenacetin]. Thirty-two genes exhibited significant changes in their gene expression ratios (experimental group/control group) according to statistical analysis using the Williams\u2019 test and the Dunnett's test. The changes appeared to be greater at 4\u00a0h than at 48\u00a0h. Finally, statistical analysis via PCA successfully differentiated the genotoxic hepatocarcinogens from the non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogen and the non-genotoxic non-hepatocarcinogen at 4\u00a0h based on 16 genes (Ccnf, Ccng1, Cyp4a10, Ddit4l, Egfr, Gadd45g, Gdf15, Hspb1, Igfbp1, Jun, Myc, Net1, Phlda3, Pml, Rcan1 and Tubb2c) and at 48\u00a0h based on 10 genes (Aen, Ccng1, Cdkn1a, Cyp21a1, Cyp4a10, Gdf15, Igfbp1, Mdm2, Phlda3 and Pmm1). Eight major biological processes were extracted from a gene ontology analysis: apoptosis, the cell cycle, cell proliferation, DNA damage, DNA repair, oxidative stress, oncogenes and tumor suppression. The major, biologically relevant gene pathway suggested was the DNA damage response, which signals through a Tp53-mediated pathway and leads to the induction of apoptosis. Immunohistochemical analyses for the expression of Cdkn1a and Hmox1 proteins and the level of apoptosis measured by the TUNEL assay in the liver confirmed the aforementioned results.

The cyto-genotoxic effects of cigarette-smoke extract (CSE) from commercial cigarettes without (A and B) and with filter (C and D) were evaluated at different CSE concentrations on A549 and BEAS-2B cells. The particle content of the cigarette smoke and the metal composition of the CSE were also analyzed. The cells were exposed to 1\u201310% of the CSE from one cigarette per experiment. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by use of the MTT assay after 24\u00a0h, and the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay after 30\u00a0min and 24\u00a0h. The Fpg-modified comet assay was used to evaluate direct-oxidative DNA damage on cells exposed for 30\u00a0min. As expected, unfiltered cigarette smoke (particularly from the B cigarette) contained a higher number of particles than filtered smoke. With smoke extract from the B cigarette we found a decrease in cell viability only in BEAS-2B cells. The results of the LDH test showed membrane damage for B-cigarette smoke extract, particularly in BEAS-2B cells. Extracts from unfiltered cigarette smoke induced significant direct DNA damage, to a larger extent in A549 cells. Filtered cigarette-smoke extract induced a significant direct DNA damage at 5\u201310%. A significant induction of oxidative DNA damage was found at the highest CSE concentration in both cell types (by smoke extracts from B and C cigarettes in A549 cells, and from A and D cigarettes in BEAS-2B cells). Smoke extracts from filter cigarettes induced less direct DNA damage than those from unfiltered cigarettes in A549 cells, probably due to a protective effect of filter. In BEAS-2B cells the smoke extract from the B-cigarette showed the highest genotoxic effect, with a concentration-dependent trend.These findings show a higher cyto-genotoxicity for smoke extracts from the B-cigarette and oxidative effects for those from the A and D cigarettes, particularly in BEAS-2B cells. Moreover, there was a higher responsiveness of A549 cells to genotoxic insult of CSE, and a cigarette-dependent genotoxicity in BEAS-2B cells. Our experimental model demonstrated to be suitable to sensitively detect early genotoxic response of different lung-cell types to non-cytotoxic concentrations of complex inhalable mixtures.",

However, the use of plastic micro-titer plates has drawbacks in the case of testing hydrophobic mutagens, since sorptive and other losses make it difficult to control and define the exposure concentrations, and they reduce availability for bacterial uptake or to the S9 enzymes. With passive dosing, a biocompatible polymer such as silicone is loaded with the test compound and acts as a partitioning source. It compensates for any losses and results in stable freely dissolved concentrations. Passive dosing using silicone O-rings was applied in the Ames II assay to measure PAH mutagenicity in strains TA98 and TAMix \u2013 a mixture of six different bacterial strains detecting six different base-pair substitutions \u2013 after metabolic activation by S9. Initially, 10 PAHs were tested with passive dosing from saturated O-rings, aiming at levels in the test medium close to aqueous solubility. Fluoranthene, pyrene and benzo(a)pyrene were mutagenic in both TA98 and TAMix, whereas benz(a)anthracene was mutagenic in TA98 only. The concentration-dependent mutagenic activity of benzo(a)pyrene was then compared for passive dosing and solvent spiking. With spiking, nominal concentrations greatly exceeded aqueous solubility before mutagenicity was observed, due to sorptive losses and limiting dissolution kinetics. In contrast, the passive dosing concentration-response curves were more reproducible, and shifted towards lower concentrations by several orders of magnitude. This study raises fundamental questions about how to introduce hydrophobic test substances in the Ames II assay with biotransformation, since the measured mutagenicity not only depends on the compound potency but also on its supply, sorption and consumption during the assay.",

On the contrary, cadmium is a highly toxic metal whose genotoxicity has been well characterized in various mammalian cells. However on non-human cells, little is known about its impact on DNA damage and repair.In this study, the genotoxic potential of both metals on embryonic zebrafish cells ZF4 was analyzed and particularly the impairment of the major DNA double strand breaks (DSB)-repair pathway, i.e. non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).To this aim, DNA single strand breaks (SSB) and DSB were evaluated using the comet assay and the immunodetection of \u03b3-H2AX proteins, respectively, in AlCl3 or CdCl2 exposed ZF4 cells. These exposures result in the production of DSBs a few hours after incubation. The DNA-PK kinase activity, essential for NHEJ, is more affected by the presence of aluminium than cadmium. Altogether our data provide evidence of the high toxicity induced by aluminium in zebrafish and indicates the pertinence of genotoxicity evaluation in organisms living in contaminated water.",

Three groups of bulbs were exposed to mobile phone radiation during 0 (sham), 3 and 9\u00a0h. A positive control group was treated during 20\u00a0min with plutonium-239 alpha-radiation. Mitotic abnormalities, chromosome aberrations, micronuclei and mitotic index were analyzed. Exposure to alpha-radiation from plutonium-239 and exposure to modulated radiation from mobile phone during 3 and 9\u00a0h significantly increased the mitotic index. GSM 900 mobile phone radiation as well as alpha-radiation from plutonium-239 induced both clastogenic and aneugenic effects. However, the aneugenic activity of mobile phone radiation was more pronounced. After 9\u00a0h of exposure to mobile phone radiation, polyploid cells, three-groups metaphases, amitoses and some unspecified abnormalities were detected, which were not registered in the other experimental groups. Importantly, GSM 900 mobile phone radiation increased the mitotic index, the frequency of mitotic and chromosome abnormalities, and the micronucleus frequency in a time-dependent manner. Due to its sensitivity, the A. cepa test can be recommended as a useful cytogenetic assay to assess cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic fields.",

A global pre-validation project sponsored by the European Cosmetics Association (Cosmetics Europe - formerly known as COLIPA), and the European Center for Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), is underway. Results to date demonstrate international inter-laboratory and inter-experimental reproducibility of the assay for chemicals that do not require metabolism [Aardema et al., Mutat. Res. 701 (2010) 123\u2013131]. We have expanded these studies to investigate chemicals that do require metabolic activation: 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4NQO), cyclophosphamide (CP), dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), dimethylnitrosamine (DMN), dibenzanthracene (DBA) and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). In this study, the standard protocol of two applications over 48\u00a0h was compared with an extended protocol involving three applications over 72\u00a0h. Extending the treatment period to 72\u00a0h changed the result significantly only for 4NQO, which was negative in the standard 48\u00a0h dosing regimen, but positive with the 72\u00a0h treatment. DMBA and CP were positive in the standard 48\u00a0h assay (CP induced a more reproducible response with the 72\u00a0h treatment) and BaP gave mixed results; DBA and DMN were negative in both the 48\u00a0h and the 72\u00a0h dosing regimens. While further work with chemicals that require metabolism is needed, it appears that the RMSN assay detects some chemicals that require metabolic activation (4 out of 6 chemicals were positive in one or both protocols). At this point in time, for general testing, the use of a longer treatment period in situations where the standard 48\u00a0h treatment is negative or questionable is recommended.",

Similar to the results obtained by the comet assay, girls showed higher mean values of all three measured parameters of the CBMN Cyt assay. This difference was statistically significant for total number of NPBs only. In the case of the NDI, a higher mean value was also obtained in girls, but this difference was not statistically significant. The results obtained present background data that could be considered as normal values for healthy children living in urban areas, and can later on serve as baseline values for further toxicological monitoring.

Previous reports have revealed that the two drugs are topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitors, and patients treated with these agents have developed unique types of secondary leukemia. A study published in 1984 by Camerman and colleagues proposed that the therapeutic effects of bimolane could be due to ICRF-154, an impurity present within the bimolane samples that may also be responsible for the toxic effects attributed to bimolane. To date, this hypothesis has not been evaluated. In addition, little is known about the potential cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of ICRF-154. In this study, a combination of in vitro tests in human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells has been used to characterize the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of ICRF-154 and bimolane as well as to compare the results for the two chemicals. ICRF-154 and bimolane were both cytotoxic, exhibiting very similar effects in three measures of cytotoxicity and cell proliferation. In the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay with CREST-antibody staining, the two agents similarly induced chromosome breakage and, to a lesser extent, chromosome loss. Intriguingly, both drugs resulted in the formation of binucleated cells, perhaps as a consequence of an interference with cytokinesis. To further investigate their aneugenic effects, flow cytometry and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses revealed that both compounds also produced similar levels of non-disjunction and polyploidy. In each of the cellular and cytogenetic assays employed, the responses of the ICRF-154-treated cells were very similar to those observed with the bimolane, and generally occurred at equimolar test concentrations. Our results, combined with those from previous studies, strongly suggest that bimolane degrades to ICRF-154, and that ICRF-154 is most likely the chemical species responsible for the cytotoxic, genotoxic, and leukemogenic effects exerted by bimolane.",

Because oxidative stress induces DNA damage, we investigated genotoxicity in lymphocytes from patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) using chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) assays. Eighteen IDA subjects and a similar number of age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. The results demonstrated that IDA was associated with a slight increase in the frequency of spontaneous CAs and a decrease in the frequency of SCEs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, the level of SCEs was positively correlated with both the ferritin concentration (r\u00a0=\u00a00.485, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and hemoglobin content (r\u00a0=\u00a00.514, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in subjects. Moreover, vitamin E treatment reduced the frequency of SCEs in IDA patients and control subjects by the same percentage (\u223c30%) without affecting the magnitude of the difference in the levels of SCEs between the two groups. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that IDA has a differential effect on the frequency of spontaneous CAs and SCEs.",

     "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is metabolically activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes, and forms DNA adduct leading to mutations. Cytochrome P450 1A1 plays a central role in this activation step, and this enzyme is strongly induced by chemical agents that bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which is also known as a dioxin receptor. 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a potent AhR ligand has not been shown to form any DNA adduct, but has a possibility to aggravate the toxicity of precarcinogenic polycyclic hydrocarbons through the induction of metabolic enzymes. We treated human hepatoma cells (HepG2) with TCDD, and subsequently exposed them to BaP to elucidate the synergistic effects on mutations. Surprisingly, mutant frequency induced by BaP at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus was decreased by pretreatment with TCDD. In correlation with decrease in the mutant frequencies, BaP\u2013DNA adduct formation was also decreased by TCDD pretreatment. This suppressive effect of TCDD was more potent when the cells were exposed to (\u00b1)-anti-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), a reactive metabolic intermediate of BaP. Among the enzymes catalyzing BaP oxidation and conjugation, cytochrome P450 1A1, 1A2, 3A4 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 mRNAs were induced by the exposure to TCDD. In cytochrome P450 1A1-deficient murine cells and cytochrome P450 1A1-uninducible human cells, TCDD could not suppress BPDE\u2013DNA adduct formation. Further experiments using \u201cTet-On\u201d cytochrome P450 1A1-overexpressing cells and a recombinant cytochrome P450 1A1 enzyme demonstrated that this is the key enzyme involved in the biotransformation of BaP, that is, both production and inactivation of BPDE. We conclude that TCDD-induced cytochrome P450 catalyzes the metabolism of BPDE to as yet-unidentified products that are not apparently DNA-reactive, thereby reducing mutations in hepatoma cells.",

Blue mussels (Mytilus spp.), which inhabit these areas, are widely used as bio-indicators in eco-toxicological studies, because of their sedentary nature and their ability to bio-accumulate contaminants. The analysis of DNA damage in mussel haemocytes is a valuable tool for biomonitoring but sampling issues related to storage, handling and transportation have often limited its application in large-scale monitoring programmes. This study uses a trial and error method to evaluate and validate a suitable protocol for cryopreservation of mussel haemocytes, thereby allowing material collected in the field to be analysed later under controlled laboratory conditions. Three different cell-culture media, i.e. Leibovitz-15, Hank's balanced salt solution and mussel physiological saline, along with four different cryoprotectants, i.e. dimethyl sulphoxide (10% and 20%), 1,2-propanediol (10%), ethylene glycol (10%) and glycerol (10%) were tested to assess their suitability for cryopreservation of mussel haemocytes for analysis in the comet assay. Experimental studies where mussel haemocytes were also exposed to UV radiation or benzo(a)pyrene were conducted in order to mimic environmental stresses and to verify the effectiveness of newly defined cryopreservation protocols. The comet assay was used to demonstrate that mussel haemocytes could be preserved at cryogenic temperatures for a month without altering levels of DNA damage, which could possibly be used for lab or field studies where time constraints or facilities do not allow instant analysis.",

     "abstract": "The recA mutants of Escherichia coli exhibit an abnormal DNA degradation that starts at sites of double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs), and is mediated by RecBCD exonuclease (ExoV). This \u201creckless\u201d DNA degradation occurs spontaneously in exponentially growing recA cells, and is stimulated by DNA-damaging agents. We have previously found that the xonA and sbcD mutations, which inactivate exonuclease I (ExoI) and SbcCD nuclease, respectively, markedly suppress \u201creckless\u201d DNA degradation in UV-irradiated recA cells. In the present work, we show that inactivation of exonuclease VII (ExoVII) by an xseA mutation contributes to attenuation of DNA degradation in UV-irradiated recA mutants. The xseA mutation itself has only a weak effect, however, it acts synergistically with the xonA or sbcD mutations in suppressing \u201creckless\u201d DNA degradation. The quadruple xseA xonA sbcD recA mutants show no sign of DNA degradation during post-irradiation incubation, suggesting that ExoVII, together with ExoI and SbcCD, plays a crucial role in regulating RecBCD-catalyzed chromosome degradation. We propose that these nucleases act on DSBs to create blunt DNA ends, the preferred substrates for the RecBCD enzyme. In addition, our results show that in UV-irradiated recF recA+ cells, the xseA, xonA, and sbcD mutations do not affect RecBCD-mediated DNA repair, suggesting that ExoVII, ExoI and SbcCD nucleases are not essential for the initial targeting of RecBCD to DSBs. It is possible that the DNA-blunting activity provided by ExoVII, ExoI and SbcCD is required for an exchange of RecBCD molecules on dsDNA ends during ongoing \u201creckless\u201d DNA degradation.",

Thermal denaturation profile of DNA shifted to higher degrees upon chromium oxide binding which accompanied by hypochromicity.

The presumed cytotoxicity of BPA to plant cells has been poorly studied. To understand how BPA might influence plant cell division and affect the underlying cytoskeleton, the effects of BPA on the microtubule (MT) arrays of meristematic root-tip cells of Pisum sativum L. were investigated. Root tips of young seedlings were exposed to 20, 50 and 100\u00a0mg/L BPA for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24\u00a0h. The effects of each treatment were determined by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy after immunolabelling of tubulin and counterstaining of DNA, and by use of light and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that BPA affected normal chromosome segregation, hampered the completion of cytokinesis and deranged interphase and mitotic MT arrays. BPA effects were dependent on the stage of each cell at the time of BPA entrance. Moreover, BPA induced the formation of macrotubules with a mean diameter of 32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14\u00a0nm, compared with 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.70\u00a0nm for the MT arrays in untreated cells. Finally, all MT arrays and macrotubules were depolymerised upon longer treatment. Taken together, the data suggest that BPA exerts acute anti-mitotic effects on meristematic root-tip cells of P. sativum, MT arrays constitute a primary sub-cellular target of BPA toxicity, and the manifested chromosomal abnormalities could be attributed to the disruption of the MT cytoskeleton.",

     "abstract": "Lung cancer is primarily caused by exposure to tobacco smoke. Tobacco smoke contains numerous carcinogens, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The most common PAH studied is benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). B[a]P is metabolically activated through multiple routes, one of which is catalyzed by aldo-keto reductase (AKR) to B[a]P-7,8-dione (BPQ). BPQ undergoes a futile redox cycle in the presence of NADPH to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, in turn, damages DNA. Studies with a yeast p53 mutagenesis system found that the generation of ROS by PAH o-quinones may contribute to lung carcinogenesis because of similarities between the patterns (types of mutations) and spectra (location of mutations) and those seen in lung cancer. The patterns were dominated by G to T transversions, and the spectra in the experimental system have mutations at lung cancer hotspots. To address repair mechanisms that are responsible for BPQ induced damage we observed the effect of mutating two DNA repair genes OGG1 and APE1 (APN1 in yeast) and tested them in a yeast reporter system for p53 mutagenesis. There was an increase in both the mutant frequency and the number of G:C/T:A transversions in p53 treated with BPQ in ogg1 yeast but not in apn1 yeast. Knocking out APN2 increased mutagenesis in the apn1 cells. In addition, we did not find a strand bias on p53 treated with BPQ in ogg1 yeast. These studies suggest that Ogg1 is involved in repairing the oxidative damage caused by BPQ, Apn1 and Apn2 have redundant functions and that the stand bias seen in lung cancer may not be due to impaired repair of oxidative lesions.",

Three assays were used: (1) the Salmonella/microsome assay with four tester strains, (2) the comet assay and (3) the micronucleus test on CHO cells. The contribution of simulated sunlight was studied in the three assays while oxidative events were only explored in the comet assay in aliquots pretreated with the antioxidant l-ergothioneine. We found that QDsN could enter CHO-K1 cells and accumulate in cytoplasmic vesicles. It was not mutagenic in the Salmonella/mutagenicity test whereas CdCl2 was weakly positive. In the dark, both the QDsN and CdCl2 similarly induced dose-dependent increases in single-strand breaks and micronuclei. Exposure to simulated sunlight significantly potentiated the genotoxic activities of both QDsN and CdCl2, but did not significantly increase micronucleus frequencies. l-Ergothioneine significantly reduced but did not completely suppress the DNA-damaging activity of QDsN and CdCl2. The present results clearly point to the genotoxic properties and the risk of long-term adverse effects of such a nanoplatform if used for human anticancer therapy and diagnosis in the future.",

Among exposed workers, chromosomal damage was related to BD exposure levels (FR\u00a0=\u00a01.35, 95% CI: 1.02\u20131.80, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); age, older workers exhibited higher MN frequencies than younger workers (FR\u00a0=\u00a01.45, 95% CI: 1.14\u20131.84, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05); and years of work, those with more years of work exhibited higher MN frequencies than those with fewer years (FR\u00a0=\u00a01.40, 95% CI: 1.10\u20131.77, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Multivariate Poisson regression analysis showed that those who carried GSTM1 (\u2212) (FR\u00a0=\u00a01.48, 95% CI: 1.14\u20131.92) or GSTT1 (\u2212) (FR\u00a0=\u00a01.42, 95% CI: 1.10\u20131.83) genotypes, and especially those who carried both (FR\u00a0=\u00a02.10, 95% CI: 1.43\u20133.09) exhibited significantly higher MN frequencies than those carrying GSTM1 (+), GSTT1 (+) genotypes or their combination. The GSTP1 Val genotype did not affect MN frequency (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Our results suggested that higher levels of BD exposure in the workplace resulted in increased chromosomal damage, and that polymorphisms in GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes might modulate the genotoxic effects of BD exposure. Furthermore, the GSTT1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms exhibited an additive effect. Finally, urinary DHBMA was found to provide a biomarker that correlated with airborne BD levels.",

     "abstract": "Based on the \u2018limited\u2019 evidence suggesting an association between exposure to radiofrequency fields (RF) emitted from mobile phones and two types of brain cancer, glioma and acoustic neuroma, the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified RF as \u2018possibly carcinogenic to humans\u2019 in group 2B. In view of this classification and the positive correlation between increased genetic damage and carcinogenesis, a meta-analysis was conducted to determine whether a significant increase in genetic damage in human cells exposed to RF provides a potential mechanism for its carcinogenic potential. The extent of genetic damage in human cells, assessed from various end-points, viz., single-/double-strand breaks in the DNA, incidence of chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and sister chromatid exchanges, reported in a total of 88 peer-reviewed scientific publications during 1990\u20132011 was considered in the meta-analysis. Among the several variables in the experimental protocols used, the influence of five specific variables related to RF exposure characteristics was investigated: (i) frequency, (ii) specific absorption rate, (iii) exposure as continuous wave, pulsed wave and occupationally exposed/mobile phone users, (iv) duration of exposure, and (v) different cell types. The data indicated the following. (1) The magnitude of difference between RF-exposed and sham-/un-exposed controls was small with some exceptions. (2) In certain RF exposure conditions there was a statistically significant increase in genotoxicity assessed from some end-points: the effect was observed in studies with small sample size and was largely influenced by publication bias. Studies conducted within the generally recommended RF exposure guidelines showed a smaller effect. (3) The multiple regression analyses and heterogeneity goodness of fit data indicated that factors other than the above five variables as well as the quality of publications have contributed to the overall results. (4) More importantly, the mean indices for chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei and sister chromatid exchange end-points in RF-exposed and sham-/un-exposed controls were within the spontaneous levels reported in a large data-base. Thus, the classification of RF as possibly carcinogenic to humans in group 2B was not supported by genotoxicity-based mechanistic evidence.",

Breast milk (10\u00a0ml) was collected from 30 women between one and two weeks post-partum. Demographic information (parity, breast cancer, occupation, duration of residency in Istanbul, consumption of fish, beef and poultry) was also obtained. Milk samples were diluted 1:1 with RPMI 1640 medium and centrifuged to collect cells. The cells were re-suspended and cell viability was determined by use of 0.4% trypan blue. DNA damage was assessed by use of the comet assay (alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis). Fifty cells per slide and two slides per sample were scored to evaluate DNA damage. The cells were visually classified into four categories on the basis of extent of migration: undamaged (UD), lightly damaged (LD), moderately damaged (MD) and highly damaged (HD). Total comet scores (TCS) were calculated as: 1\u00d7 UD\u00a0+\u00a02\u00d7 LD\u00a0+\u00a03\u00d7 MD\u00a0+\u00a04\u00d7 HD. Exfoliated mammary cells of the donors showed high (TCS\u00a0\u2265\u00a0150\u00a0a.u.), moderate and low DNA damage in 10 (33.3%), 8 (26.7%) and 12 (40%) mothers, respectively. There was no significant correlation between TCS for DNA damage and the duration of previous breastfeeding, parity or age. None of the mothers was vegetarian, smoker or on any medication. Meat and chicken consumption did not significantly correlate with the TCS values. Fish consumption was significantly correlated with TCS results (Spearman's rho\u00a0=\u00a00.39, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No significant correlation was found between the DNA-damage scores and the period of residency in Istanbul, but fish consumption increased as the duration of stay was longer (Spearman's rho\u00a0=\u00a00.53, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). These findings suggest that the primary causes of differences in genotoxicity detected in lactating mothers in Istanbul may be of dietary origin. Our experience also confirms that sampling breast milk from lactating mothers provides a valuable and non-invasive tool to study DNA damage in mammary cells.",

     "abstract": "Estragole (ES), a natural organic compound, is frequently used as a flavoring in food even though it is a hepatocarcinogen in mice. Although formation of ES-specific DNA adducts following conversion from ES to the nucleophilic metabolite by sulfotransferase 1A1 (SULT1A1) has been reported, the modes of action underlying ES-induced hepatocarcinogenesis remain uncertain because conventional genotoxicity tests for ES yield negative results. In the present study, taking notice of the fact that there is a sex difference in SULT1A1 activity in the mouse liver, we assessed the frequency of micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes and the mutant frequency (MF) of reporter genes in female gpt delta mice treated with ES at doses of 0 (corn oil), 37.5, 75, 150 or 300\u00a0mg/kg body weight (bw) by gavage for 13 weeks. Results were compared with those obtained in males. Since one female was found dead at week one, the highest dose was reduced to 250\u00a0mg/kg bw in females from week two. As reported previously in C57BL/6 mice, the mRNA levels of Sult1a1 in female gpt delta mice were significantly higher than those in the males. The levels of ES-specific DNA adducts in the females were higher than those in the males at all doses except the highest dose. In addition, MFs of the gpt gene were significantly increased from doses of 75\u00a0mg/kg bw of females, but the increment was observed only at the highest dose in males. There were no changes in the micronucleus test among the groups. Thus, the overall data suggest that specific DNA modifications by the SULT1A1-mediated carbocation formation and the resultant genotoxicity are key events in the early stage of ES-induced hepatocarcinogenesis of mice.",

Various concentrations of apigenin (0, 10, 20, and 40\u00a0mg/kg body weight) were administered to mice by a single intraperitoneal injection 3\u00a0hr after receiving 0 or 3\u00a0Gy of 137Cs gamma rays. Mice receiving vehicle only (no radiation and no apigenin) served as sham controls. We assessed the anti-oxidative activity of apigenin in vivo by measuring levels of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxy guanosine (8-OH-dG) in bone marrow (BM) cells, collected at days 3 and 10 after irradiation, from groups of mice (5 mice per treatment group) with or without apigenin treatment. Simultaneously, we evaluated the ability of apigenin to diminish radiation-induced inflammatory responses in bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from the same individual mice used for measuring the level of 8-OH-dG. To do this, the levels of activated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) and NF-kappa B-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokines [i.e. interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)] were measured in BMDMs. Our results indicated significant reductions (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 or <0.05) in the levels of 8-OH-dG in BM cells collected at both harvest times from irradiated mice receiving apigenin treatment, at all apigenin concentrations tested. Likewise, activation of NF-kappa B in BMDMs collected from gamma-irradiated mice that received apigenin was suppressed at both harvest times. Further, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in gamma-irradiated mice treated with 20 or 40\u00a0mg/kg body weight apigenin were significantly lower than those in mice receiving radiation only (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 or <0.05) even at day 10 post-irradiation. Additionally, the ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes indicated that apigenin ameliorated radiation-induced hematological toxicity.

     "abstract": "Particulate matter (PM) has become an important health risk factor in our society. PM can easily deposit in the bronchi and lungs, causing diverse diseases such as respiratory infections, lung cancers and cardiovascular diseases. In recent days, more and more toxicological studies have been dealing with air particles in distinctive areas including industrial areas, transportation sites, or indoors. Studies on subway PM in particular, have been recognizing PM as an important health risk factor because many people use subways as a major mode of public transportation (4 million people a day in Korea). The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the genotoxic effects of organic extract (OE) of subway PM10 and potential attribution of PAHs to these effects. Particles were collected in the subway tunnel at Kil-eum station (Line 4) for one month and then extracted with Dichloromethane (DCM). Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO-K1) and human normal bronchial cells (BEAS-2B) were exposed to OE, and MN and Comet assays were conducted to analyze the genotoxicity. The results showed that OE increased DNA or chromosome damages in both cell lines. In the modified Comet assay and MN assay with free radical scavengers, we confirmed that the genotoxic effect of OE was partially due to the oxidative damage on DNA. DCFH-DA assay also indicated that OE induced ROS generation in BEAS-2B cells. PAHs [benzo(a)anthracene, benzo(k)fluoranthrene, etc.], the most well-known carcinogens in polluted air, were detected in Kil-eum PM10. In conclusion, our findings confirmed that OE of subway PM10 has genotoxic effects on normal human lung cells, and oxidative stress could be one of the major mechanisms of these genotoxic effects. In addition, some genotoxic and carcinogenic PAHs were detected in OE by GC/MS/MS, even though PAHs level was not enough to increase CYP1A1 gene. Therefore, we suggest that additive or synergistic effects by unidentified chemicals as well as PAHs contained in OE of subway PM10 may induce genotoxic effects and further researches are needed to identify the genotoxic compounds in subway PM.",

Although HU has been associated with an increased risk of leukemia in some patients with myeloproliferative disorders, the mutagenic and carcinogenic potential of HU has not been established. This study used the alkaline comet assay to investigate DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes from 41 individuals with SCA treated with HU (SCAHU) and from 26 normal individuals. The presence of HbS and the analysis of the haplotypes of the beta S gene cluster were done by polymerase chain reaction\u2013restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR\u2013RFLP). The damage index (DI) in the SCAHU group was significantly higher than in controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Neither gender nor age was associated with DNA damage in controls or SCAHU individuals. Among the SCAHU individuals, DI was significantly influenced by length of HU treatment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0039) and BMI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Individuals with length of HU treatment\u00a0\u2265\u00a020 months and BMI\u00a0\u2264\u00a020\u00a0kg/m2 had a significantly greater DI than those with length of HU treatment\u00a0<\u00a020 months and BMI\u00a0>\u00a020\u00a0kg/m2. No significant influence of mean HU dose was observed on DI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.950). However, individuals who received a mean HU dose\u00a0\u2265\u00a020\u00a0mg/kg showed a higher DI than those who received less. Furthermore, an association was observed between DI damage and HBB*S gene haplotypes. DI values for the Bantu/Bantu haplotype was greater when compared to the Benin/Benin haplotype; and the Bantu/Benin haplotype had a DI lower than the Bantu/Bantu haplotype and greater than the Benin/Benin haplotype.

The reproducibility of this assay was evident for both unirradiated and irradiated samples by examining human blood lymphocytes from 14 donors. This technique was sensitive enough to detect deletions in mtDNA at low dose levels, as low as 0.5\u00a0Gy, and higher levels of CD mtDNA were evident at higher doses (\u22651\u00a0Gy), however, there was no consistent dose\u2013response relationship.",

While the population exposed to Ag-np continues to increase with ever new applications, Ag-np remains a controversial research area with regard to their toxicity in biological systems. Here a genotoxic and cytotoxic approach was employed to elucidate the activity of Ag-np in vitro and in vivo. Characterization of Ag-np using scanning electron microscopy revealed a size range of 90\u2013180\u00a0nm. Cytotoxic potential of Ag-np was evaluated in human lymphocytes via cell viability assay (Trypan blue dye exclusion method, MTT and WST assay). The uptake and incorporation of Ag-np into the lymphocytes was confirmed by flow cytometry. Additionally apoptosis (AnnexinV-FITC\u2013PI staining) and DNA strand breaks (comet assay) in human lymphocytes revealed that Ag-np at concentration 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml can cause genotoxicity. In vivo experiments on plants (Allium cepa and Nicotiana tabacum) and animal (Swiss albino male mice) showed impairment of nuclear DNA. Induction of oxidative stress was also studied. The DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations raise the concern about the safety associated with applications of the Ag-np. A single ip administration of Ag-np gave a significant (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) increase in the frequency of aberrant cells and Tail DNA percent at concentrations 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight and above. Results of comet assay in A. cepa and N. tabacum demonstrated that the genotoxic effect of Ag-np was more pronounced in root than shoot/leaf of the plants. The present study indicated a good correlation between the in vitro and in vivo experiments. Therefore the biological applications employing Ag-np should be given special attention besides adapting the antimicrobial potential.",

     "abstract": "The impact on the sensitivity of the in vitro comet assay by increasing the number of cells scored has only been addressed in a few studies. The present study investigated whether the sensitivity of the assay could be improved by scoring more than 100 cells. Two cell lines and three different chemicals were used: Caco-2 cells were exposed to ethylmethane sulfonate and hydrogen peroxide in three concentrations, and HepG2 cells were exposed to ethylmethane sulfonate, hydrogen peroxide and benzo[a]pyrene in up to four concentrations, in four to five independent experiments. The scoring was carried out by means of a fully automated scoring system and the results were analyzed by evaluating the % tail DNA of 100\u2013700 randomly selected cells for each slide consisting of two gels. By increasing the number of cells scored, the coefficients of variance decreased, leading to an improved sensitivity of the assay. A two-way ANOVA analysis of variance showed that the contribution from the two variables \u201cthe number of cells scored\u201d and \u201cconcentration\u201d on the total variation in the coefficients of variance dataset was statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The increase in sensitivity was demonstrated by the possibility to detect an increase in % tail DNA with statistical significance at lower concentrations. The results indicated that for low levels of DNA damage, below 9% tail DNA, scoring of 600 cells increased the sensitivity compared with scoring of 100 cells. For relatively low levels of DNA damage, about 9\u201316% tail DNA, scoring of 300 cells increased the sensitivity. Thus, the recommendation for the optimum number of cells scored would be 600 and 300 for low and relatively low levels of DNA damage, respectively. The findings from this study could be particularly important for bio-monitoring studies where small differences in DNA-damage levels could be relevant.",

Aim of this study was to find out if intake of a RES-containing supplement protects healthy humans against oxidative DNA-damage and alters their redox status. Therefore, an intervention trial was conducted in which the participants (n\u00a0=\u00a012) consumed a RES-containing supplement over a period of five days. At the start, after one day and after five days of consumption, and after a washout period DNA stability was measured in single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assays with peripheral blood lymphocytes. These tests were conducted (a) under standard conditions, which reflect single- and double-strand DNA breaks, (b) after treatment of the cells with hydrogen peroxide, which enables detection of alterations of the ROS sensitivity, and (c) by use of formamidopyrimidine DNA-glycosylase (FPG), which provides information on formation of oxidatively damaged bases (pyrimidines). Furthermore, the biochemical parameters TAC (total antioxidant capacity) and oxLDL (oxidized low-density lipoprotein), which reflect the redox status, and C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, were monitored. The intake of the supplement had no significant impact on the DNA stability parameters and on the different biomarkers of the redox status. Our results indicate that intake of 6\u00a0mg RES per day via the supplement does not cause DNA-protective or antioxidant effects. This amount is equivalent to or lower than that reached after intake of many (ca. 50%) of the RES-containing preparations which are currently on the market in Middle Europe, and is contained in 0.3\u20132\u00a0L red wine.",

Therefore, concentrations of 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, and 5.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL were used for evaluation of the genotoxic and antigenotoxic potential of PA in V79 cells. For genotoxic and antigenotoxic assessment in Swiss mice, three PA doses were tested (20, 40, and 80\u00a0mg/kg body weight) based on the solubility limit of the diterpene in dimethylsulfoxide and water. The in vitro results demonstrated that PA induced DNA damage at concentrations of 2.5 and 5.0\u00a0\u03bcg/mL in the comet assay. However, no genotoxic effect was observed in the micronucleus test using V79 cells. In the in vivo evaluation of genotoxicity, a significant increase in the frequency of DNA damage was observed in hepatocytes of animals treated with the highest PA dose (80\u00a0mg/kg) when compared to the control group, but this difference was not seen in the micronucleus test. Furthermore, PA significantly reduced the frequency of DXR- and MMS-induced micronuclei and extent of DNA damage in in vitro and in vivo test systems.",

     "abstract": "Ionizing radiation leads to damage at various cellular and sub-cellular levels and can be prevented by radioprotectors. There are many in vitro and in vivo but rather expensive assays for screening of radioprotectors from natural and synthetic sources. We have developed a cell free radioprotector screening assay which involves bleaching of crocin pigment, isolated from saffron by radiolytic products of water. Any molecules/compounds which can inhibit the bleaching of the crocin will act as a radioprotector. The developed assay was further validated by the existing in vitro assays. Different radioprotectors have different level for inhibition of bleaching of crocin. The trends of radioprotection offered by crocin bleaching assay, plasmid relaxation and lipid peroxidation are TMG\u00a0>\u00a0FA\u00a0>\u00a0VA\u00a0>\u00a0Amifos\u00a0>\u00a0Trox, TMG\u00a0>\u00a0VA\u00a0>\u00a0FA\u00a0>\u00a0Amifos\u00a0>\u00a0Trox, and TMG\u00a0>\u00a0FA\u00a0>\u00a0Trox\u00a0>\u00a0VA\u00a0>\u00a0Amifos, respectively. We are getting different trends for different assays. This is because different drugs have different mechanisms of radioprotection in different assay systems. In conclusion, the crocin bleaching assay developed here is a simple, fast and economical screening assay and it will have great value in radioprotection programme for screening many potential compounds for radioprotection.",

While C60 induced no structural chromosome aberrations in CHL/IU cells at up to 5\u00a0mg/ml (the maximum concentration tested), it significantly induced polyploidy at 2.5 and 5\u00a0mg/ml with and without metabolic activation. In BALB 3T3 cells, C60 showed no phototoxic potential but the anatase form of titanium oxide did.

     "abstract": "Consumers are exposed daily to several pesticide residues in food, which can be of potential concern for human health. Based on a previous study dealing with exposure of the French population to pesticide residues via the food, we selected 14 pesticides frequently found in foodstuffs, on the basis of their persistence in the environment or their bioaccumulation in the food chain. In a first step, the objective of this study was to investigate if the 14 selected pesticides were potentially cytotoxic and genotoxic. For this purpose, we used a new and sensitive genotoxicity assay (the \u03b3H2AX test, involving phosphorylation of histone H2AX) with four human cell lines (ACHN, SH-SY5Y, LS-174T and HepG2), each originating from a potential target tissue of food contaminants (kidney, nervous system, colon, and liver, respectively). Tebufenpyrad was the only compound identified as genotoxic and the effect was only observed in the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell-line. A time-course study showed that DNA damage appeared early after treatment (1\u00a0h), suggesting that oxidative stress could be responsible for the induction of \u03b3H2AX. In a second step, three other pesticides were studied, i.e. bixafen, fenpyroximate and tolfenpyrad, which \u2013 like tebufenpad \u2013 also had a methyl-pyrazole structure. All these compounds demonstrated genotoxic activity in SH-SY5Y cells at low concentration (nanomolar range). Complementary experiments demonstrated that the same compounds show genotoxicity in a human T-cell leukemia cell line (Jurkat). Moreover, we observed an increased production of reactive oxygen species in Jurkat cells in the presence of the four methyl-pyrazoles. These results demonstrate that tebufenpyrad, bixafen, fenpyroximat and tolfenpyrad induce DNA damage in human cell lines, very likely by a mode of action that involves oxidative stress. Nonetheless, additional in vivo data are required before a definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding hazard prediction to humans.",

Genetic changes occurring in somatic cells of the wing's imaginal discs, cause the formation of mutant clones on the wing blade. The results of this study show that citalopram had a genotoxic effect in the Drosophila SMART. Sertraline, however, did not show any genotoxic effect in balancer heterozygous wings.

In a recent study, 2% Dammar resin showed significant hepatocarcinogenicity in a rat 2-year bioassay. Therefore, for an accurate estimate of human risk, it is necessary to understand whether Dammar resin induces liver genotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms of its hepatocarcinogenicity. Modifying effects of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ), a typical genotoxic carcinogen produced during cooking of protein-rich foods, was also studied in the present study. Exposure of gpt delta mice to Dammar resin at a dose of 2% for 12 weeks did not induce any obvious mutagenicity in the liver. However, the index of cell proliferation, the level of 8-OHdG, and bax, bcl-2, p53, cyp1a2, cyp2e1, gpx1 and gstm2 gene expression were all significantly increased when compared with the control group. In the IQ treatment group, at a dose of 300\u00a0ppm, mutagenicity was readily detected, the index of cell proliferation increased, and p53, cyp2e1 and gpx1 gene expression was down-regulated in the liver. Down-regulation of p53, P450s, and gpx1 in the livers of IQ treated mice are consistent with its genotoxic mechanism of carcinogenicity observed in a 675-day study. In contrast, our results using gpt delta mice suggest that Dammar resin is not genotoxic. Instead, the Dammar resin-induced hepatocarcinogenicity seen in our previous 2-year study with rats may have been mediated by non-genotoxic mechanisms, including increased P450 enzyme activity, increased oxidative stress, altered gene expression, and promotion of cell proliferation.",

The progeny of the irradiated nematodes showed an increased mutation frequency in the unc-58 gene, with a maximum response observed at 1\u00a0Gy. Significant differences were also found in gene expression between the irradiated (1\u00a0Gy) and non-irradiated nematode lines. Differences in gene expression did not show clear clustering into certain gene categories, suggesting that the instability might be a chaotic process rather than a result of changes in the function of few specific genes such as, e.g., those responsible for DNA repair. Increased heterogeneity in gene expression, which has previously been described in irradiated cultured human lymphocytes, was also observed in the present study in C. elegans, the coefficient of variation of gene expression being higher in the progeny of irradiated nematodes than in control nematodes.

Two different protocols for treatment with cytochalasin B were used. We found that PLGA\u2013PEO was neither cytotoxic (measured by relative cell growth activity and cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI)), nor did it induce DNA strand-breaks (detected by the comet assay) or oxidative DNA lesions (measured by the comet assay modified with lesion-specific enzyme formamidopyrimidine-DNA-glycosylase). There were no statistically significant differences in the frequencies of micronucleated binucleated cells (MNBNCs) between untreated and treated cells in either of the conditions used. This suggests that PLGA\u2013PEO did not have potential genotoxicity. However, using two experimental protocols of the micronucleus assay, PLGA\u2013PEO nanoparticles showed a weak but significant increase in the level of MN in mononucleated cells, in cells treated for 48\u00a0h with PLGA\u2013PEO nanoparticles when cytochalasin B was added for the last 24\u00a0h (1st protocol), and in cells treated for 24\u00a0h with PLGA\u2013PEO nanoparticles followed by washing of NPs and addition of cytochalasin B for another 24\u00a0h (2nd protocol). It remains unclear whether the increase of MNMNC after treatment with PLGA\u2013PEO nanoparticles is the effect of a possible, weak aneugenic potential or early effect of these particles, or due to another reason.

Therefore, the degree of correlation between radiation-induced DNA damage, as measured by the alkaline and the neutral comet assays, and the clonogenic survival of different human tumor cells was studied.

Five different human tumor cell lines were chosen and the radiosensitivity of these cells was established by clonogenic assay. Alkaline and neutral comet assays were performed in \u03b3-irradiated cells (2\u20138\u00a0Gy; either acute or fractionated). Quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the expression of DNA damage response genes in control and irradiated cells. The relative radiosensitivity of the cell lines assessed by the extent of DNA damage (neutral comet assay) immediately after irradiation (4\u00a0Gy or 6\u00a0Gy) was in agreement with radiosensitivity pattern obtained by the clonogenic assay. The survival fraction of irradiated cells showed a better correlation with the magnitude of DNA damage measured by the neutral comet assay (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.9; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; 6\u00a0Gy) than evaluated by alkaline comet assay (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.73; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05; 6\u00a0Gy).

Nevertheless, the physiological meaning of such DNA damage for the plant in the long term remains to be elucidated. To know more about this, two experiments were carried out with the plant model V. faba. In a preliminary short-term experiment, seeds were exposed for five days to a soil spiked with different concentrations of CdCl2 in order to identify the concentration inducing the highest number of micronuclei without affecting plant growth. Thereafter, a long-term experiment was performed in the soil spiked with such a concentration (i.e. 510\u00a0\u03bcmol CdCl2 per kg dry soil), in which V. faba seeds were directly sowed and allowed to grow during 151 days. As a result, Cd-spiked soil did not affect seed-emergence time nor the growth-rate of the plants for the first two months. The first signs of toxicity appeared after the 70th day of exposure. Interestingly, exposed plants produced their first flower earlier and had a longer flowering period than did control ones. Nevertheless, total flower production was less abundant in exposed plants than in control plants. Moreover, fruits appeared in control plants whereas no fruit was formed in exposed plants. At last, exposed plants showed a reduced life time.Our results suggest that the micronucleus assay can provide a predictive biomarker of long-term deleterious effects in plants.",

Seven major biological processes were extracted from the gene ontology analysis: apoptosis, the cell cycle, cell proliferation, DNA damage, DNA repair, oncogenes and tumor suppression. The major, biologically relevant gene pathway suggested was the DNA damage response pathway, resulting from signal transduction by a p53-class mediator leading to the induction of apoptosis. Eight genes (Aen, Bax, Btg2, Ccng1, Cdkn1a, Gdf15, Phlda3 and Plk2) that are directly associated with Trp53 contributed to the PCA. The current findings demonstrate a successful discrimination between genotoxic and non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens, using qPCR and PCA, on 12 genes associated with a Trp53-mediated signaling pathway for DNA damage response at 4 and 48\u00a0h after a single administration of chemicals.",

     "abstract": "Cyclotides are a family of ultra-stable, head-to-tail cyclic mini-proteins from plants, with each member comprising about 30 amino acid residues. Their stability derives from the unique structural topology where the cyclic backbone and two disulfide bonds make up an embedded ring, which is knotted by a third disulfide bond. The cyclotides find potential applications in the pharmaceutical industry as stable peptide-based scaffolds for unstable drugs, and also as medicinal agents, due to the wide range of their inherent pharmacological activities. However, there is a lack of fundamental toxicological studies on this type of compound. The current study determined the possible DNA-damaging effects of three cyclotides, i.e., cycloviolacin O2, vaby D, and kalata B1, in human lymphoma cells by use of the alkaline version of the comet assay. The three cyclotides induced massive DNA fragmentation at lethal concentrations. At a sub-lethal concentration, cycloviolacin O2 and vaby D gave a bell-shaped dose\u2013response curve for their DNA-damaging effect. Kalata B1 caused no significant DNA damage at sub-cytotoxic concentrations. Single-cell micro-autoradiography was carried out on tritium-labeled cycloviolacin O2 in order to understand the mechanism behind the dose\u2013response curve. The results revealed that the peptide is taken up into the cell, both at cytotoxic and at low concentrations. Most biological effects of the cyclotides have been taken to follow from the disruption of cell membranes, but even if the intracellular mechanisms and targets still remain unknown, the current study has unequivocally demonstrated that cyclotides also must have other dose-dependent modes of action.",

     "abstract": "Although cadmium is a well-established human carcinogen, the mechanisms by which it induces cancer are poorly understood. It is suggested that cadmium-mediated carcinogenesis may include the modulation of gene expression and signal-transduction pathways, interference with antioxidant enzymes, inhibition of DNA repair and DNA methylation, and induction of apoptosis. Nevertheless, no predominant mechanism playing a role in metal-induced carcinogenesis has been reported. In the present study, we used a pig Robertsonian translocation model, which is a cross between a wild boar and domestic pig resulting in Robertsonian translocation (37,XX,der15;17 or 37,XY,der15;17), to determine the role of cadmium sulfate in the modulation of genomic DNA-methylation status and the induction of aneuploidy. We found a cadmium-mediated increase in aneuploidy within chromosome group A and C, but not within chromosome group D containing the translocated chromosome der15,17 which indicates that translocated chromosome is not more prone to chromosomal aberrations than are other chromosomes. We suggest that cadmium-induced aneuploidy (up to 5-\u03bcM concentration) may be mediated by global DNA hypermethylation as monitored with HPLC and 5-mdC immunostaining. In addition, the cyto- and genotoxic potential of cadmium was evaluated. Cadmium sulfate was able to induce apoptosis, inhibit cell-proliferative status and expression of nucleolar organizer regions (NORs), and increase oxidative DNA damage (8-oxoG content).",

The test was established and validated with mitomycin C (MMC), 1,3-dinitropyrene (1,3-DNP), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO) and chloramphenicol (CHL) as toxins with known responses in the umu-assay.

Hence, the modified umu-assay was proven to be a sensitive test for determining the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of toxins, with results that were comparable with literature data.

The purpose of this study was to explore whether rhEPO protects against Cisp-induced genotoxicity in rat bone-marrow cells.

     "abstract": "The frequency of spontaneously occurring micronuclei (MN) increases with age, with many of these MN containing sex chromatin. However, it is not known if this MN frequency increase is attributable to a higher number of the same cellular events that occur in younger people, or if a different sex chromosomal instability mechanism(s) arises with age. To gain insight regarding this question, the total number of signals present in MN and their corresponding binucleates, was scored in older (ages 40\u201380+ y.o.; n\u00a0=\u00a040) compared to younger (7\u201339 y.o.; n\u00a0=\u00a019) individuals using probes specific for the X and Y chromosomes. In 19.9% of the cells scored at least one sex chromatin positive micronucleus was present. A significant decrease in cells having a \u201ccorrective\u201d loss pattern (i.e. trisomy rescue, leading to euploid binucleates following sex chromatin exclusion into the MN) was observed with increasing age for the Y chromosome in males (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and the X chromosome in females (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). In addition, a significant increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in cells having multiple signals beyond those expected from a single cellular error was observed in the older compared to younger study participants, with these imbalances resulting from cells having either a single micronucleus with multiple signals, or cells having multiple MN. Collectively, these findings suggest that age-related increases in MN frequencies reflect both gains in the occurrence of similar cellular errors, as well as changes in the types of chromosomal findings that occur. Importantly, these results also illustrate that while MN frequencies reflect acquired abnormalities, they may also reflect cellular responses to \u201ccorrect\u201d an error, particularly when evaluated in young individuals. Therefore, when analyzing MN frequencies, one may also wish to evaluate the imbalances present in both the binucleates and MN to facilitate the recognition of varying cellular responses to environmental or genotoxic exposures.",

These assays have been proven to be of high sensitivity and specificity to predict hepatocarcinogenicity of compounds that cannot be detected by bone marrow micronucleus assays. On the contrary, the existing assays have only been evaluated for their use in detecting micronucleus induction in the settings of relatively short-term cell proliferation. However, the integration of in vivo genotoxicity endpoints into routine toxicity studies is increasingly desired from the viewpoint of animal welfare to reduce the number of animals used. In the present study, the rodent hepatocarcinogens diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and 2,4-diaminotoluene (2,4-DAT) were repeatedly administered orally to male Crl:CD (SD) rats (6 weeks old at the beginning of administration) for 5, 14, and 28 days, and changes in the frequency of hepatocytes with micronuclei in liver tissues that had undergone no artificial treatment to accelerate cell proliferation were evaluated. At the same time, a new method of hepatocyte isolation involving the treatment of a portion of the liver with collagenase in a centrifuge tube, without the use of in situ perfusion, was established. The induction of micronucleated hepatocytes was achieved after the repeated administration of DEN for 5 days or longer and of 2,4-DAT for 14 days or longer. Micronucleus frequencies were increased depending on the number of administrations, indicating that micronucleated hepatocytes had possibly remained for a long period of time and accumulated additively. It therefore appears that even in adult rat liver with low mitotic activity, a repeated-dose of a chemical substance for 14 days or longer enables the detection of micronucleus induction. In addition, the establishment of a method to isolate hepatocytes without perfusion using only a part of the liver enables the integration of liver micronucleus assays into general toxicity studies.",

Its bioactivation produces four major metabolites, i.e., 3,4-epoxy-1-butene (EB), 3,4-epoxy-1,2-butanediol (EBD), 1,2,3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB), and 3-butene-1,2-diol (BDD). Studies have been mostly focused on DEB due to its strong mutagenicity/carcinogenicity. In contrast, studies of genotoxicity of EB, EBD, and BDD have been limited. In particular, genotoxicity of EBD and BDD using strand breaks as the endpoint has not been investigated. To obtain a more complete understanding of BD toxicity, in the present study, we used comet assay to investigate DNA damage induced by EB, EBD, and BDD in human hepatocyte L02 cells, with the aim to determine their relative potencies, the types of DNA damage, and the possible pathway to form strand breaks. Using alkaline comet assay (pH\u00a0>\u00a013), it was observed that EB and EBD caused similar concentration-dependent increases in DNA migration from 50 to 1000\u00a0\u03bcM. However, BDD induced a statistically significant increase only at 1000\u00a0\u03bcM, and the increase itself was very small. EBD was as potent as EB at lower concentrations (\u2264200\u00a0\u03bcM), and was slightly less potent than EB at higher concentrations. The results indicated that these metabolites could generate strand breaks in cells with the rank order of the potencies being EB\u00a0>\u00a0\u2248\u00a0EBD\u00a0\u226b\u00a0BDD. All three compounds failed to cause statistically significant increases in DNA migration in pre-lysed cells, suggesting that they did not produce strand breaks through chemical pathways under our experimental conditions. By using comet assays at pH 11.9 and pH 9, it was demonstrated that EB and EBD generated both single-strand breaks (SSB) and alkali-labile sites, but BDD produced only SSB. To our knowledge, this is the first report to investigate EBD- and BDD-induced strand breaks in cells. The results implied that EBD could play an important role in toxicity of BD.",

In this study, the in vitro genotoxic potential of epoxides originating from 1,3-butadiene (3,4-epoxy-1-butene: EB; 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane: DEB), isoprene (3,4-epoxy-2-methyl-1-butene: IO), styrene (styrene-7,8-oxide: SO), propylene (propylene oxide: PO) and 1-butene (1,2-epoxy-butane: BO) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and promyelocytic leukaemia cells (HL60) was measured with the comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis, SCGE). The effect of inclusion of foetal calf serum (FCS, 5%) in the cell-culture medium and different durations of exposure (2\u00a0h, 24\u00a0h) were also investigated. All epoxides tested produced DNA damage in a concentration range that did not reduce cell viability. HL60 cells were more resistant than PBMCs to the DNA damage induced by the different epoxides. With the exception of IO, the treatment for 24\u00a0h resulted in an increase of DNA damage. FCS slightly protected PBMCs from the genotoxic effects induced by IO and BO, whilst no such effect was noted for the other compounds. Overall, the dose-dependent effects that were seen allowed us to define a genotoxicity scale for the different epoxides as follows: SO\u00a0>\u00a0EB\u00a0>\u00a0DEB\u00a0>\u00a0IO\u00a0>\u00a0PO\u00a0>\u00a0BO, which is in partial agreement with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classification of the carcinogenic hazards.",

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the value of the micronucleus (MN) test as a bio-dosimeter in hospital workers exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation. Blood samples were obtained from 30 subjects selected among workers exposed to X- and gamma-radiation, and 30 controls matched for sex, age and smoking from the same hospital. Micronucleus frequencies were analyzed by use of the cytokinesis-block method. The MN frequency was compared among the groups considering the confounding factors and the length of employment. No increase in the number of bi-nucleated cells with MN (BNMN), but a significant increase in the number of mono-nucleated cells with micronuclei (MOMN) was observed in exposed subjects compared with the controls. The relationship between MN frequency and accumulated dose (mSv) was evaluated. The length of employment did not affect the extent of MN frequency, but an increase of BNMN and MOMN cells was observed based on the accumulated radiation dose. Our study shows the sensitivity of the MN test in the detection of cytogenetic effects of cumulative exposure levels, suggesting the potential usefulness of this assay in providing a biological index in medical surveillance programs.",

Here we present data on the presence of DNA strand-breaks and apoptotic cells assessed by use of comet and diffusion assays in erythrocytes of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus niloticus) and African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). The results showed high degrees of DNA damage and increased frequencies of apoptotic nuclei in blood of fish collected from downstream compared with those sampled from upstream river Nile. Qualitative analysis revealed a shift in the frequency of DNA-damage classes towards higher damage levels correlating with the increasing pollution gradient. The degree of DNA damage measured by use of comet assay and diffusion assay exhibited seasonal variations. Both fish species showed significant increases in DNA damage during the summer. The results of our study indicated that the alkaline comet assay seems to be a useful technique for in situ genotoxic monitoring. At the same time the diffusion assay is sensitive enough to detect low frequencies of apoptotic nuclei. The results reveal species-specific differences in sensitivities, suggesting that Nile tilapia may serve as a more sensitive test species compared with the African catfish. Based on the outcome of the comet and diffusion assays, it can be concluded that the water quality of the river Nile with respect to the presence of genotoxic compounds needs to be improved, especially in its estuaries. As far as we know this is the first time that the comet and diffusion assays are used for genotoxic monitoring of the river Nile.",

Apart from its neurotoxic effects in non-target species, allethrin is reported to be mutagenic in bacterial systems. In this study, we observed oxidative damage-mediated genotoxicity caused by allethrin in Swiss albino mice. The genotoxic potential of allethrin was evaluated using chromosome aberrations (CAs) and a micronuclei (MN) induction assay as genetic end-points. The oral intubation of allethrin (25 and 50\u00a0mg/kg b.wt.) significantly induces CAs and MN in mouse bone marrow cells. The DNA-damaging potential of allethrin was estimated in mouse liver using the DNA alkaline unwinding assay (DAUA) and by measuring the levels of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxy-guanosine (8-OH-dG). Furthermore, a dose-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation (LPO), with a concurrent decrease in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase, confirm its pro-oxidant potential. The DNA-damaging potential of allethrin was found to be mediated through the modulation of p53, p21, GADD45\u03b1 and MDM-2. These results confirm the genotoxic and the pro-oxidant potential of allethrin in Swiss albino mice.",

The cytokinesis-block method was used to record the frequency of micronuclei (MN) as genotoxicity end-point. When lymphocytes from six donors were pre-exposed to RF at 0.3\u00a0W/kg SAR and then treated with MMC, these cells showed a significant reduction in the frequency of MN, compared with the cells treated with MMC alone; this result is indicative of induction of AR. The results from our earlier study indicated that lymphocytes that were stimulated for 24\u00a0h, exposed for 20\u00a0h to a 900\u00a0MHz RF GSM (global system for mobile communication) signal at 1.25\u00a0W/kg SAR and then treated with 100\u00a0ng/ml MMC, also exhibited AR.

Such a direct comparison of the two test methods with the same overnight culture(s), chemicals and S9-mix preparation should exclude external variability factors. Thirteen of the 15 chemicals showed concordant results in both tests despite the choice of chemicals that showed varying inter- and even intra-laboratory results in the NTP studies.

CHO cells were treated with a single concentration of SN (100\u00a0ng/ml), and the frequency of unstable chromosomal aberrations was determined at three times after treatment (18\u00a0h, and 6 and 15 days) by using PNA-FISH with a pan-telomeric probe. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a higher frequency of aberrations at 18\u00a0h and 6 days after treatment in SN-exposed cultures vs. untreated cultures. The percentage of damaged cells and the yield of SN-induced aberrations at 6 days after treatment increased on average twofold compared with the ones at 18\u00a0h after treatment. Moreover, a significant decrease in the frequency of aberrations was observed in SN-exposed cells at 15 days after treatment, resulting in a frequency of aberrations significantly lower than the frequency of aberrations observed in the corresponding control cultures. These data indicate that SN induces delayed chromosomal instability in CHO cells, and that the in vitro clastogenic effect of this compound persists for at least 6 days but less than 15 days after treatment. In addition, we found that SN induces delayed ITSs instability, cytogenetically detectable as additional FISH signals and centromeric breaks involving dissociation of the telomeric signal 6 days after treatment. We propose that the delayed effect of SN on ITSs results from breakage of heterochromatic centromeric ITSs blocks and further insertion of these sequences at the sites of mono- or isochromatid breaks occurring at G2 or G1-S phases of the cell cycle, respectively, since most of the additional FISH signals were present as single or double dots, and located at interstitial sites of the involved chromosomes.",

     "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are pivotal phase-II enzymes for detoxification of xenobiotics. Pi-class GSTs play key roles in determining cancer susceptibility. The laboratory mouse Mus musculus (Mm) has two GST-Pi-encoding genes; while MmGstp1 is the counterpart of the unique human and rat Pi-class GST gene, the function of MmGstp2 remains unclear because its expression is almost undetectable in liver and its product lacks activity against typical GST/GST-Pi substrates. Mus spretus (Ms) is an aboriginal mouse species of great interest as a bio-indicator in environmental pollution studies and a reservoir of novel allelic variants and phenotypes. Using absolute real-time RT-PCR, we demonstrate significant differences in the hepatic levels of GST-Pi-encoding mRNAs between both mouse species. Particularly, we found that the Gstp2 gene of M. spretus, unlike its M. musculus counterpart, attains relatively high steady-state level of expression (\u223c30\u00a0molecules/pg of total liver RNA in mice dwelling in a non-polluted area). To test whether the interspecies difference in Gstp2 mRNA levels is due, at least in part, to evolutionary divergence in the promoter regions, we (i) sequenced the 5\u2032-flanking regulatory regions of the two Gstp2 genes; (ii) used bioinformatics tools to identify differences in TF binding sites (TFBSs) and cis-regulatory modules; and (iii) extended the in silico results to a cell-based functional assay. We observed high sequence divergence (2.8%) and differences in TFBSs (32.6%) between the two Gstp2 promoters. We also show that constructs harbouring promoter fragments with species-specific cis-regulatory motifs displayed differential luciferase reporter activity, suggesting that these promoter sequence variations may determine, at least in part, the strong difference in Gstp2 mRNA levels between M. musculus and M. spretus. Additionally, the comparative analysis of the coding sequences predicts that the MsGstp2 product may be an active Pi-class GST because of a Pro12 to Arg12 substitution. Interestingly, free-living M. spretus mice dwelling at an industrial settlement displayed significantly higher amounts of transcripts for both GST-P1 and GST-P2 than those from a non-polluted area, suggesting that. M. spretus may optimise the response to pollution by co-evolving the expression levels of the two Pi-class GST genes. Overall, our data suggest that MsGstp2 may be one of the genes contributing to the natural resistance of M. spretus, facilitating its adaptation in a wild environment. Further insights into the functional roles of mouse Pi-class GSTs should be gained from the data reported in this work.",

At this dose (37.2\u00a0\u03bcM) of apigenin, the LD50 radiation dose of HPBL increased from 2.9\u00a0Gy to 3.4\u00a0Gy, which resulted in a DMF of 1.17. Apigenin (37.2\u00a0\u03bcM) treatment 1\u00a0h before irradiation significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduced DNA damage in irradiated HPBL as measured by comet assay (% tail DNA, tail length, tail moment, and olive tail moment). Moreover, apigenin treatment significantly decreased the frequencies of dicentric (DC), acentric fragments (AF), and acentric rings (AR) in irradiated HPBL. Apigenin pretreatment also reduced the radiation-induced CBMN (cytokinesis blocked micronuclei) anomalies such as micronuclei (MNi), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB) and nuclear buds (NBUD) in HPBL. These results also showed that there was a significant correlation between NPB and DC frequencies and MNi and AF\u00a0+\u00a0AR. Treatment with apigenin alone had no significant effect on DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations in HPBL. Thus, the current studies indicate that apigenin protects HPBL from radiation-induced cytogenetic alterations.",

The alkaline comet assay was performed on cells exposed to 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml ptaquiloside for 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50\u00a0min. Tail length was used as a DNA-damage parameter. Assays to determine structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations and sister-chromatid exchange were conducted on cells exposed to 5, 10 or 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml ptaquiloside for 48\u00a0h. The tail length showed maximum DNA damage at 20\u201330\u00a0min, diminishing onwards. Highly significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) dose-dependent increases in structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations and SCE were observed in response to ptaquiloside. These results indicate that ptaquiloside is not only a DNA-alkylating agent, but expresses its genotoxicity through multiple mechanisms including clastogenesis, aneugenesis and the mechanism underlying SCE induction, which is not entirely understood. Recent studies support the role played by aneuploidy in oncogenesis, highlighting the importance of this endpoint for mutagenicity screening. SCE are thought to represent the long-term effects of mutagens and are an important genotoxicity biomarker. The present results also agree with data from epidemiological studies and from animal in vivo studies, further supporting the hypothesis that ptaquiloside may represent a significant threat to human health.",

Positive results were also observed in the alkaline comet assay without S9, indicating DNA strand breakage. To ascertain repair of damage, we performed the comet assay in V79 cells after two hours of recovery, and observed a reduction of the genotoxic response. Estragole did not produce strand breaks in plasmid DNA in vitro. We then evaluated the formation of DNA adducts in V79 cells by use of the 32P-postlabelling assay and detected a dose-dependent formation of DNA adducts, which may be responsible for its genotoxicity. We then assayed estragole in the comet assay with two CHO cell lines, a parental AA8 cell line, and an XRCC1-deficient cell line, EM9. Results confirmed the genotoxicity of estragole without biotransformation in both cell lines, although the genotoxicity in EM9 cells compared with that in AA8 cells was not significantly different, suggesting that the XRCC1 protein is not involved in the repair of estragole-induced lesions. Estragole induces apoptosis, but only with high doses (2000\u00a0\u03bcM), and after long treatment periods (24\u00a0h). Overall, our results suggest that estragole, besides being metabolized to genotoxic metabolites, is a weak direct-acting genotoxin that forms DNA adducts.",

We have already reported that dosing of the test compound after partial hepatectomy (PH) is essential to detect genotoxicity of numerical chromosome aberration inducers in mice [Mutat. Res. 632 (2007) 89\u201398]. In naive animals, the proportion of binucleated cells in rats is less than half of that in mice, which suggests a species difference in the response to chromosome aberration inducers. In the present study, we investigated the responses to structural and numerical chromosome aberration inducers in the rat liver micronucleus test. Two structural chromosome aberretion inducers (diethylnitrosamine and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine) and two numerical chromosome aberration inducers (colchicine and carbendazim) were used in the present study. PH was performed a day before or after the dosing of the test compound in 8-week old male F344 rats and hepatocytes were isolated 4 days after the PH. As a result, diethylnitrosamine and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine, structural chromosome aberration inducers, exhibited significant increase in the incidence of micronucleated hepatocyte (MNH) when given either before and after PH. Colchicine and carbendazim, numerical chromosome aberration inducers, did not result in any toxicologically significant increase in MNH frequency when given before PH, while they exhibited MNH induction when given after PH. It is confirmed that dosing after PH is essential in order to detect genotoxicity of numerical chromosome aberration inducers in rats as well as in mice. Regarding the species difference, a different temporal response to colchicine was identified. Colchicine increased the incidence of MNH 4 days after PH in rats, although such induction in mice was observed 8\u201310 days after PH.",

RCC and RI are more likely to lead to selection of concentrations for micronucleus scoring that are highly cytotoxic and thus could potentially lead to artefacts of toxicity being scored (elevated levels of apoptosis and necrosis), generating misleading positive results.These results suggest that a further reduction in the frequency of misleading positive results in in vitro cytogenetic assays can be achieved with this set of chemicals, by avoiding the use of toxicity measures that underestimate the level of toxicity induced.",

     "abstract": "Diphenylamine (DPA) is an antioxidant compound that occurs naturally in several vegetables. It is widely applied in agriculture for preservation of the quality of apples and pears, and used for controlling superficial scald, a disorder that renders fruits of a number of apple cultivars unfit for the market. Because of its anti-oxidative properties, DPA also has several industrial applications. The potential genotoxic effect of DPA on human lymphocytes has previously been investigated in only two studies, which focused on detection of chromosome aberrations and sister chromatid exchange, respectively. In the present analysis, we evaluated micronucleus (MN) formation in freshly isolated human peripheral lymphocytes exposed to different concentrations (0.625, 1.25, 2.50, 5.0 and 10.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) of DPA. Peripheral venous blood was collected from ten healthy subjects, and a total of 10,000 bi-nucleated cells were analyzed. Results indicated that DPA significantly increased the micronucleus frequency at concentrations of 1.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and higher. Significant differences in the MN frequency were also found between the lower dose (0.625\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and all other doses tested, with the exception of 1.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Our results indicate a potential cytogenetic effect of DPA on human cells in vitro and require further in vivo studies to clarify the actual genotoxicity of this compound and the consequent risks for human health.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the mutagenetic effects of co-exposure to 50-Hz, 10-mT EMFs and bleomycin (BLM) using an ex vivo newborn rat astrocyte micronucleus assay. We also investigated whether the mutagenetic effects of EMFs were related to active oxygen species by using 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine-1-oxyl (tempol), a superoxide radical scavenger. Three-day-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were co-exposed to 50-Hz EMFs and BLM (5 or 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight (BW)) in each group (n\u00a0=\u00a06; total 6 group), and were co-exposed to 50-Hz EMFs and 10\u00a0mg/kg BW BLM with administration of 200\u00a0\u03bcmol/kg BW tempol in each group (total 4 group). Brain cells were dissociated into single cells, cultured for 96\u00a0h, incubated with an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein, and stained with acridine orange. The frequency of micronucleated astrocytes was determined using a fluorescence microscope. The frequency of micronucleated astrocytes in the 10\u00a0mg/kg BW bleomycin plus EMF exposure group (Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 19.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u2030) was 1.6 times higher than that in the 10\u00a0mg/kg BW bleomycin plus sham-exposure group (Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 12.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3\u2030) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Analysis of the frequency of micronuclei in astrocytes after co-exposure to EMF and bleomycin for 72\u00a0h and administration of tempol revealed that, in the EMF exposure group, the frequency of micronuclei in rats administered with 10\u00a0mg/kg BW bleomycin and treated with tempol (Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 11.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9\u2030) was 40% of that in rats administered with the same dose of bleomycin and physiological saline (Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 28.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.0\u2030) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

     "abstract": "While the in vivo comet assay increases its role in regulatory safety testing, deliberations about the interpretation of comet data continue. Concerns can arise regarding comet assay publications with limited data from non-blind testing of positive control compounds and using protocols (e.g. dose concentrations, sample times, and tissues) known to give an expected effect. There may be a tendency towards bias when the validation or interpretation of comet assay data is based on results generated by widely accepted but non-validated assays. The greatest advantages of the comet assay are its sensitivity and its ability to detect genotoxicity in tissues and at sample times that could not previously be evaluated. Guidelines for its use and interpretation in safety testing should take these factors into account. Guidelines should be derived from objective review of data generated by blind testing of unknown compounds dosed at non-toxic concentrations and evaluated in a true safety-testing environment, where the experimental design and conclusions must be defensible. However, positive in vivo comet findings with such compounds are rarely submitted to regulatory agencies and this data is typically unavailable for publication due to its proprietary nature. To enhance the development of guidelines for safety testing with the comet assay, and with the permission of several sponsors, this paper presents and discusses relevant data from multiple GLP comet studies conducted blind, with unknown pharmaceuticals and consumer products. Based on these data and the lessons we have learned through the course of conducting these studies, I suggest significant adjustments to the current conventions, and I provide recommendations for interpreting in vivo comet assay results in situations where risk must be evaluated in the absence of carcinogenicity or clinical data.",

     "abstract": "Toxicogenomics (TGx) can be defined as the application of \u201comics\u201d techniques to toxicology and risk assessment. By identifying molecular changes associated with toxicity, TGx data might assist hazard identification and investigate causes. Early technical challenges were evaluated and addressed by consortia (e.g. ISLI/HESI and the Microarray Quality Control consortium), which demonstrated that TGx gave reliable and reproducible information. The MAQC also produced \u201cbest practice on signature generation\u201d after conducting an extensive evaluation of different methods on common datasets. Two findings of note were the need for methods that control batch variability, and that the predictive ability of a signature changes in concert with the variability of the endpoint. The key challenge remaining is data interpretation, because TGx can identify molecular changes that are causal, associated with or incidental to toxicity. Application of Bradford Hill's tests for causation, which are used to build mode of action (MOA) arguments, can produce reasonable hypotheses linking altered pathways to phenotypic changes. However, challenges in interpretation still remain: are all pathway changes equal, which are most important and plausibly linked to toxicity? Therefore the expert judgement of the toxicologist is still needed. There are theoretical reasons why consistent alterations across a metabolic pathway are important, but similar changes in signalling pathways may not alter information flow. At the molecular level thresholds may be due to the inherent properties of the regulatory network, for example switch-like behaviours from some network motifs (e.g. positive feedback) in the perturbed pathway leading to the toxicity. The application of systems biology methods to TGx data can generate hypotheses that explain why a threshold response exists. However, are we adequately trained to make these judgments? There is a need for collaborative efforts between regulators, industry and academia to properly define how these technologies can be applied using appropriate case-studies.",

Analysis of microarray data from untreated or vehicle-treated animals within the control arm of toxicogenomics studies has yielded useful information on baseline fluctuations in liver gene expression in the rodent. Here, studies which highlight contributions of different factors to gene expression variability in the rodent liver are discussed including a large meta-analysis of rat liver, which identified genes that vary in control animals in the absence of chemical treatment. Genes and their pathways that are the most and least variable were identified in a number of these studies. Life stage, fasting, sex, diet, circadian rhythm and liver lobe source can profoundly influence gene expression in the liver. Recognition of biological and technical factors that contribute to variability of background gene expression can help the investigator in the design of an experiment that maximizes sensitivity and reduces the influence of confounders that may lead to misinterpretation of genomic changes. The factors that contribute to variability in liver gene expression in rodents are likely analogous to those contributing to human interindividual variability in drug response and chemical toxicity. Identification of batteries of genes that are altered in a variety of background conditions could be used to predict responses to drugs and chemicals in appropriate models of the human liver.",

     "abstract": "The vision of the toxicology in the 21st century movement is to overcome the currently used animal tests and identify molecular pathways of toxicity, using human in vitro systems with the aim to provide the most relevant mechanistic information for human risk assessment. It is expected to translate key surrogate biomarkers to novel types of toxicity-related high throughput screening of the many thousands of compounds which need to be tested during development phases of the pharmaceutical industry and with regard to the REACH legislation in Europe.Systems biology, an emerging and increasingly popular field of research, appears to be the discipline of choice to integrate results from transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics and metabonomics technologies used to analyze samples from toxicological models. The challenges, however, with respect to data generation, statistical treatment, bioinformatic integration and interpretation or in silico modeling remain formidable.One of the main difficulties is the fact that the sheer number of molecular species is inflated enormously in the course of translation from genes to proteins due to post-translational modifications. Moreover, at the level of proteins, time scales of cellular reactions to toxic insults can be very fast, ranging from milliseconds to seconds. Linear dynamic ranges of concentration differences between conditions can also differ by several orders of magnitude.So, the search for protein biomarkers of toxicity requires sophisticated strategies for time-resolved quantitative differential approaches. The statistical principles, normalization of primary data and principal component and cluster analysis have been well developed for genomics/transcriptomics and partly for proteomics, but have not been widely adapted to technologies like metabonomics. Also, the integration of functional data, in particular data from mass spectrometry, with the aim of modeling pathways of toxicity for human risk assessment, is still at an infant stage.",

Gene expression profiling forms a promising tool for the development of new biomarkers in blood cells to overcome these limitations. The aim of our research was to identify novel genomics-based candidate markers for genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogen exposure in human peripheral blood cells (PBMC). Whole genome gene expression changes were investigated following 20\u00a0h of in vitro exposure to a high and low concentration of eight genotoxic and three non-genotoxic carcinogenic compounds using whole genome microarrays. Per condition, PBMC of five independent donors were exposed, all in the presence of human liver S9. Sets of genes, as well as biological pathways indicative of genotoxic exposure and of non-genotoxic carcinogenic exposure were identified. Furthermore, networks were built using the genotoxic and non-genotoxic gene sets, showing the majority of the genes to be interlinked and revealing distinctive transcription factors for both classes.

A comparison of the transcriptional BMD values with those for the traditional non-cancer and cancer apical endpoints showed a high degree of correlation for specific pathways. Many of the correlated pathways have been implicated in non-cancer and cancer disease pathogenesis.

Numerous metabolome patterns have been established for different toxicological targets (liver, kidney, thyroid, testes, blood, nervous system and endocrine system) which are specific for different toxicological modes of action. With these patterns early detection of toxicological effects and the underlying mechanism can now be obtained from routine studies. Early recognition of toxicological mode of action will help to develop new compounds with a more favourable toxicological profile and will also help to reduce the number of animal studies necessary to do so. Thus this technology contributes to animal welfare by means of reduction through refinement (2R), but also has potential as a replacement method by analyzing samples from in vitro studies.With respect to the REACH legislation for which a large number of animal studies will need to be performed, one of the most promising methods to reduce the number of animal experiments is grouping of chemicals and read-across to those which are data rich.

Here we report on the supervised assembly of a series of tissue-specific functional gene sets intended to aid transcriptomic analysis of chemical impacts on the female teleost reproductive axis. Gene sets were defined based on an updated graphical systems model of the teleost brain\u2013pituitary\u2013gonadal-hepatic axis. Features depicted in the model were organized into gene sets and mapped to specific probes on three zebrafish (Danio rerio) and two fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas) microarray platforms. Coverage of target genes on the microarrays ranged from 48% for the fathead minnow arrays to 88% for the most current zebrafish platform. Additionally, extended fathead minnow gene sets, incorporating first degree neighbors identified from a Spearman correlation network derived from a large compendium of fathead minnow microarray data, were constructed. Overall, only 14% of the 78 genes queried were connected in the network. Among those, over half had less than five neighbors, while two genes, cyclin b1 and zona pellucida glycoprotein 3, had over 100 first degree neighbors, and were neighbors to one another. Gene set enrichment analyses were conducted using microarray data from a zebrafish hypoxia experiment and fathead minnow time-course experiments conducted with three different endocrine-active chemicals.

Much information is available on molecules and pathways involved in cancer onset and progression and this data provides a valuable resource for the development of predictive computer models that can help to identify new potential drug targets or to improve therapies. Modeling cancer treatment has to take into account many cellular pathways usually leading to the construction of large mathematical models. The development of such models is complicated by the fact that relevant parameters are either completely unknown, or can at best be measured under highly artificial conditions. Here we propose an approach for constructing predictive models of such complex biological networks in the absence of accurate knowledge on parameter values, and apply this strategy to predict the effects of perturbations induced by anti-cancer drug target inhibitions on an epidermal growth factor (EGF) signaling network. The strategy is based on a Monte Carlo approach, in which the kinetic parameters are repeatedly sampled from specific probability distributions and used for multiple parallel simulations. Simulation results from different forms of the model (e.g., a model that expresses a certain mutation or mutation pattern or the treatment by a certain drug or drug combination) can be compared with the unperturbed control model and used for the prediction of the perturbation effects. This framework opens the way to experiment with complex biological networks in the computer, likely to save costs in drug development and to improve patient therapy.",

The steroidal part is aimed to serve as a biological platform enabling the alkylating moiety to approach its site of action by altering its physicochemical properties. The purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate these compounds for anti-neoplastic activity. The compounds tested have as alkylators either para-NN-bis(2-chloroethyl)-aminophenyl-butyrate (CHL) or para-N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)-aminophenyl-acetate (PHE) esterified with a differently modified steroidal nucleus. The eight newly synthesised compounds were compared on a molar basis with respect to their ability to induce sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and to modify proliferation rate indices (PRI) in lymphocytic leukaemia P388 cells in mice in vivo. The life span of BDF1 mice inoculated with P388 leukaemia cells was also estimated (anti-leukaemic activity). The compounds that were effective in inducing cytogenetic effects in lymphocytic leukaemia cells in vivo were also effective in inducing antineoplastic effects in BDF1 mice inoculated with P388 leukaemia cells.These results suggest that the in vivo cytogenetic effects in conjunction with the antineoplastic activity of modified steroidal alkylators depend on the configuration of the whole molecule and on the appropriate combination of the alkylator with the steroidal molecule: a pronounced cytogenetic and anti-neoplastic action was demonstrated by the compounds that contain either PHE or CHL as alkylators and are esterified with either a steroidal nucleus that carries a cholesten group in the 17 position of the D-ring, or with a steroidal nucleus having an exocyclic NHCO-group in the D-ring. In contrast, a ketone group or an NHCO-group in the D-ring inserted endocyclically in the steroidal nucleus esterified with either CHL or PHE failed to induce cytogenetic or anti-neoplastic effects.",

Similarly to the situation following metabolic activation, photo-mutagenicity of Nr was seen with all Salmonella strains tested, albeit with different effects between these strains. To our knowledge, Nr is the only photo-mutagen showing such a broad action. Since the effects are also observed in strains not known to be responsive to ROS, this indicates that ROS production is not the sole mode of action that leads to photo-genotoxicity. The reactive species produced by irradiation are short-lived as pre-irradiation of an Nr solution did not produce mutagenic effects when added to the bacteria. In addition, mutagenicity in TA98 following irradiation was stronger than in the nitroreductase-deficient strain TA98NR, indicating that nitro derivatives that are transformed by bacterial nitroreductase to hydroxylamines appear to play a role in the photo-mutagenicity of Nr. Photo-genotoxicity of Nr was further investigated in the comet assay and micronucleus test in L5178Y cells.

These modifications did not affect the kinase and non-kinase selectivity of the compounds. Several of these compounds were positive in the MN(vit), however, two compounds were found to be negative and these were also confirmed to be negative in the MLA. It was considered possible that topoisomerase II or off-target kinase inhibition may have been responsible for the observed mammalian cell genotoxicity. The present investigations show how an iterative chemical design, along with genotoxicity screening by use of a semi-automated MN(vit), can identify and remove the genotoxic hazard from pharmaceutical projects at an early stage of development, and produce high-quality molecules suitable for further progression.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate and validate treatment conditions for the use of p53 competent TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells in a TG487 compliant MNvit assay. The ten reference compounds suggested in TG487 (mitomycin C, cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, benzo-a-pyrene, vinblastine sulphate, colchicine, sodium chloride, nalidixic acid and di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate and pyrene) and noscapine hydrochloride were chosen for this study. In order to optimize the micronucleus response after treatment with some positive substances, we extended the recovery time after pulse treatment from 2 cell cycles recommended in TG487 to 3 cell cycles for untreated cells (40\u00a0h). Each compound was tested in at least one of four exposure conditions: a 4\u00a0h exposure followed by a 40\u00a0h recovery, a 4\u00a0h exposure followed by a 24\u00a0h recovery, a 4\u00a0h exposure in the presence of an exogenous metabolic activation system followed by a 40\u00a0h recovery period, and a 27\u00a0h continuous direct treatment. Results show that the direct acting clastogens, clastogens requiring metabolic activation and aneugens caused a robust increase in micronuclei in at least one test condition whereas the negative compounds did not induce micronuclei. The negative control cultures exhibited reproducibly low and consistent micronucleus frequencies ranging from 0.4 to 1.8% (0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3% average and standard deviation). Furthermore, extending the recovery period from 24\u00a0h to 40\u00a0h produced a 2-fold higher micronucleus frequency after a 4\u00a0h pulse treatment with mitomycin C. In summary, the protocol described in this study in TK6 cells produced the expected result with model compounds and should be suitable for performing the MNvit assay in accordance with guideline TG487.",

The assessment of genotoxic effects caused by environmental pollutants is of great concern because of their relevance in carcinogenesis. In this work, the earthworm Eisenia andrei was exposed for 10 and 28 days to artificial standard soil contaminated with environmentally relevant concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) (0.1, 10, 50\u00a0ppm) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-para-dioxin (TCDD) (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125, 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124, 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123\u00a0ppm). Micronucleus (MNi) induction was evaluated in earthworm coelomocytes after DNA staining with the fluorescent dye DAPI. In the same cells, the DNA damage was assessed by means of the alkaline comet assay. Induction of MNi in coelomocytes, identified according to standard criteria, was demonstrated. B[a]P exposure for 10 and 28 days induced a significant increase in MNi frequency. In TCDD-treated earthworms, a significant effect on chromosomal damage was observed at all the concentrations used; surprisingly, greater effects were induced in animals exposed to the lowest concentration (1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125\u00a0ppm). The data of the comet assay revealed a significant increase in the level of DNA damage in coelomocytes of earthworms exposed for 10 and 28 days to the different concentrations of B[a]P and TCDD. The results show that the comet and MN assays were able to reveal genotoxic effects in earthworms exposed even to the lowest concentrations of both chemicals tested here. The combined application in E. andrei of the comet assay and the micronucleus test, which reflect different biological mechanisms, may be suggested to identify genotoxic effects induced in these invertebrates by environmental contaminants in terrestrial ecosystems.",

Toluene neurotoxicity and reproductive toxicity are well recognized; however, its genotoxicity is still under discussion, and toluene is not classified as a carcinogenic solvent. Using the comet assay and the micronucleus test for detection of possible genotoxic effects of toluene, we monitored industrial painters from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The putative involvement of oxidative stress in genetic damage and the influences of age, smoking, alcohol consumption, and exposure time were also assessed. Although all biomarkers of toluene exposure were below the biological exposure limits, painters presented significantly higher DNA damage (comet assay) than the control group; however, in the micronucleus assay, no significant difference was observed. Painters also showed alterations in hepatic enzymes and albumin levels, as well as oxidative damage, suggesting the involvement of oxidative stress. According to multiple linear regression analysis, blood toluene levels may account for the increased DNA damage in painters. In summary, this study showed that low levels of toluene exposure can cause genetic damage, and this is related to oxidative stress, age, and time of exposure.",

In this study, various concentrations of copper and zinc salts were applied to cucumber seedlings during germination.

All treatment concentrations (40, 80, 160, 240, 320, and 640\u00a0mg/L) used in the study caused a decrease/delay in germination of the cucumbers to different extents.

The aim of this study was to investigate the anti-cytogenotoxic effects of pre-treatment with V. album extract (VAE) and QE on MTX-induced chromosomal aberrations (CAs) in mouse bone-marrow cells. Pre-treatment of mice by gavage with VAE (250\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw/day for 10 days) and QE (50\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw/day for 10 days) caused a significant decrease in CAs and in the number of aberrant cells with CAs induced by intramuscular treatment of the mice with MTX (10\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw/day for 3 days), when compared with the group treated with MTX alone. These compounds also significantly increased the mitotic index (MI) in bone-marrow cells that had been suppressed by MTX. In conclusion, from the findings we suggest that VAE and QE may play a role in reducing cyto-genotoxicity induced by anti-neoplastic drugs during cancer chemotherapy.",

Among the numerous biomarkers of the effect of food-related carcinogens and for the assessment of the degree of risk for disease, chromosomal damage detection is very predictive.The aim of this study was to test antigenotoxic effect of ellagic acid (EA) both in in vitro and in vivo studies, in combination with N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), a methylating agent. EA, a naturally occurring and widely distributed plant phenol, has been intensively studied but with conflicting results, depending on the endpoints considered and the experimental material employed. In vitro and in vivo studies differ in their experimental schedule: in the in vitro study pre- and post-treatments and simultaneous treatments with EA were performed, while in the in vivo study only pre-treatment was carried out.The results of this study clearly demonstrate a protective action of EA with respect to MNNG-induced micronuclei and cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. The lack of effect in the post-treatment in in vitro experiments excludes a possible effect of EA on DNA-repair systems. On the other hand, consumption of EA can have a protective action against primary DNA damage induced by oxidative stress.",

To further shed light on the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by cisplatin, we examined the nuclear proteome profiles of HeLa cells treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcM cisplatin for different times (2, 12, and 24\u00a0h). Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) identified 98 differentially expressed proteins in cisplatin-treated cells as compared to control cells. Among them, 54 spots (55%) were down-regulated and 44 spots (45%) were up-regulated. 51 spots were subjected to Matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization Time-of-flight/time-of-flight Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) identification, and 40 spots were identified. Among these, 22 proteins were located in nucleus. These proteins were involved in stress response, cell cycle and division, apoptosis, mRNA processing, transport, splicing and microRNA (miRNA) maturation. The changed expression of Annexin A1 and Lamin B1 were confirmed by Western blot. The role of Annexin A1 in the response to cisplatin-induced DNA damage was further analyzed, and it was shown that after Annexin A1 knockdown, cisplatin-induced DNA damage was significantly increased. In addition, the changed expression of several miRNAs was also observed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Taken together, these data indicate that cisplatin-induced DDR is a complex process, and that those proteins identified by proteomics can lead to new directions for a better understanding of this process.",

Approximately half of the chemicals regarded as hormetic, and the majority of the specific dose\u2013responses identified as hormetic, were actually nonmutagenic. We conclude that the data provide no evidence of hormetic effects. The Ames test is an excellent measure of bacterial mutagenicity, but the numbers of revertant (mutant) colonies on the plate are the result of a complex interaction between mutagenicity and toxicity, which renders the test inappropriate for demonstrating hormesis in bacterial mutagenicity experiments.",

A current issue regarding nanomaterials is the extent to which existing genotoxicity assays are useful for evaluating the risks associated with their use. In this study, the genotoxicity of 5\u00a0nm AgNPs was assessed using two standard genotoxicity assays, the Salmonella reverse mutation assay (Ames test) and the in vitro micronucleus assay. Using the preincubation version of the Ames assay, Salmonella strains TA102, TA100, TA1537, TA98, and TA1535 were treated with 0.15\u201376.8\u00a0\u03bcg/plate of the AgNPs. Toxicity limited the doses that could be assayed to 2.4\u201338.4\u00a0\u03bcg/plate; no increases in mutant frequency over the vehicle control were found for the concentrations that could be assayed. Human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells were treated with 10\u201330\u00a0\u03bcg/ml AgNPs, and additional cells were treated with water and 0.73\u00a0gy X-rays as vehicle and positive controls. Micronucleus frequency was increased by the AgNP treatment in a dose-dependent manner. At a concentration of 30\u00a0\u03bcg/ml (with 45.4% relative population doubling), AgNPs induced a significant, 3.17-fold increase with a net increase of 1.60% in micronucleus frequency over the vehicle control, a weak positive response by our criteria. These results demonstrate that the 5\u00a0nm AgNP are genotoxic in TK6 cells.

For this reason, this work has investigated the effects of aSiO2NPs on Balb/3T3 mouse fibroblasts, focusing on cytotoxicity, cell transformation and genotoxicity. Results obtained using aSiO2NPs, with diameters between 15\u00a0nm and 300\u00a0nm and exposure times up to 72\u00a0h, have not shown any cytotoxic effect on Balb/3T3 cells as measured by the MTT test and the Colony Forming Efficiency (CFE) assay. Furthermore, aSiO2NPs have induced no morphological transformation in Balb/3T3 cells and have not resulted in genotoxicity, as shown by Cell Transformation Assay (CTA) and Micronucleus (MN) assay, respectively. To understand whether the absence of any toxic effect could result from a lack of internalization of the aSiO2NPs by Balb/3T3 cells, we have investigated the uptake and the intracellular distribution following exposure to 85\u00a0nm fluorescently-labelled aSiO2NPs. Using fluorescence microscopy, it was observed that fluorescent aSiO2NPs are internalized and located exclusively in the cytoplasmic region. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that although aSiO2NPs are internalized in vitro by Balb/3T3 mouse fibroblasts, they do not trigger any cytotoxic or genotoxic effect and do not induce morphological transformation, suggesting that they might be a useful component in industrial applications.",

     "abstract": "In this work in situ proliferation of A549 human lung epithelial carcinoma cells exposed to nanomaterials (NMs) was investigated in the presence or absence of 10% serum. NMs were selected based on chemical composition, size, charge and shape (Lys-SiO2, TiO2, ZnO, and multi walled carbon nanotubes, MWCNTs). Cells were treated with NMs and 4\u00a0h later, cytochalasin-B was added. 36\u00a0h later, cell morphology was analyzed under a light microscope. Nuclearity was scored to determine the cytokinesis-block proliferation index (CBPI). CBPI, based on percentage of mono-, bi- and multi-nucleated cells, reflects cell toxicity and cell cycle delay. For some conditions depending on NM type (TiO2 and MWCNT) and serum concentration (0%) scoring of CBPI was impossible due to overload of agglomerated NMs. Moreover, where heavy agglomeration occurs, micronuclei (MN) detection and scoring under microscope was prevented. A statistically significant decrease of CBPI was found for ZnO NM suspended in medium in the absence or presence of 10% serum at 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, respectively and for Lys-SiO2 NM at 3.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml in 0% serum. Increase in MN frequency was observed in cells treated in 10% serum with 50\u00a0\u03bcg/ml ZnO. In 0% serum, the concentrations tested led to high toxicity. No genotoxic effects were induced by Lys-SiO2 both in the absence or presence of serum up to 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. No toxicity was detected for TiO2 and MWCNTs in both 10% and 0% serum, up to the dose of 250\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. Restoration of CBPI comparable to untreated control was shown for cells cultured without serum and treated with 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of Lys-SiO2 NM pre-incubated in 100% serum. This observation confirms the protective effect of serum on Lys-SiO2 NM cell toxicity. In conclusion in situ CBPI is proposed as a simple preliminary assay to assess both NMs induced cell toxicity and feasibility of MN scoring under microscope.",

     "abstract": "Carbon nanotubes were among the earliest products of nanotechnology and have many potential applications in medicine, electronics, and manufacturing. The low density, small size, and biological persistence of carbon nanotubes create challenges for exposure control and monitoring and make respiratory exposures to workers likely. We have previously shown mitotic spindle aberrations in cultured primary and immortalized human airway epithelial cells exposed to 24, 48 and 96\u00a0\u03bcg/cm2 single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). To investigate mitotic spindle aberrations at concentrations anticipated in exposed workers, primary and immortalized human airway epithelial cells were exposed to SWCNT for 24\u201372\u00a0h at doses equivalent to 20 weeks of exposure at the Permissible Exposure Limit for particulates not otherwise regulated. We have now demonstrated fragmented centrosomes, disrupted mitotic spindles and aneuploid chromosome number at those doses. The data further demonstrated multipolar mitotic spindles comprised 95% of the disrupted mitoses. The increased multipolar mitotic spindles were associated with an increased number of cells in the G2 phase of mitosis, indicating a mitotic checkpoint response. Nanotubes were observed in association with mitotic spindle microtubules, the centrosomes and condensed chromatin in cells exposed to 0.024, 0.24, 2.4 and 24\u00a0\u03bcg/cm2 SWCNT. Three-dimensional reconstructions showed carbon nanotubes within the centrosome structure. The lower doses did not cause cytotoxicity or reduction in colony formation after 24\u00a0h; however, after three days, significant cytotoxicity was observed in the SWCNT-exposed cells. Colony formation assays showed an increased proliferation seven days after exposure. Our results show significant disruption of the mitotic spindle by SWCNT at occupationally relevant doses. The increased proliferation that was observed in carbon nanotube-exposed cells indicates a greater potential to pass the genetic damage to daughter cells. Disruption of the centrosome is common in many solid tumors including lung cancer. The resulting aneuploidy is an early event in the progression of many cancers, suggesting that it may play a role in both tumorigenesis and tumor progression. These results suggest caution should be used in the handling and processing of carbon nanotubes.",

We investigated the effects of NPs in an in vivo Comet/micronucleus (MN) combination assay and in an in vitro MN assay performed with human blood. We also incorporated additional endpoints into the in vivo study in an effort to delineate primary from secondary mechanisms. Amorphous silica NPs (15 and 55\u00a0nm) were chosen for their known reactivity, while gold nano/microparticles (2, 20, and 200\u00a0nm) were selected for their wide size range and lower reactivity. DNA damage in liver, lung and blood cells and micronuclei in circulating reticulocytes were measured after 3 consecutive intravenous injections to male Wistar rats at 48, 24 and 4\u00a0h before sacrifice. Gold nano/microparticles were negative for MN induction in vitro and in vivo, and for the induction of DNA damage in all tissues. Silica particles, however, caused a small but reproducible increase in DNA damage and micronucleated reticulocytes when tested at their maximum tolerated dose (MTD). No genotoxic effects were observed at lower doses, and the in vitro MN assay was also negative. We hypothesize that silica NPs initiate secondary genotoxic effects through release of inflammatory cell-derived oxidants, similar to that described for crystalline silica (quartz). Such a mechanism is supported by the occurrence of increased neutrophilic infiltration, necrosis, and apoptotic cells in the liver, and induction of inflammatory markers TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in plasma at the MTDs. These results were fairly consistent between silica NPs and the quartz control, thereby strengthening the argument that silica NPs may act in a similar, thresholded manner. The observed profile is supportive of a secondary genotoxicity mechanism that is driven by inflammation.",

The administration of three test materials differing only in their primary particle size (2, 20 and 200\u00a0nm) did not lead to relevant DNA damage in the mentioned tests. The measurement of clinical pathology parameters in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood indicated neither relevant local reactions in the animals\u2019 lungs nor adverse systemic effects. Minor histopathology findings occurred in the lung of the animals exposed to 20\u00a0nm and 200\u00a0nm sized nanomaterials. In conclusion, under the conditions of this study the different sized gold NP tested were non-genotoxic and showed no systemic and local adverse effects at the given dose.",

     "abstract": "In vitro studies have suggested that nanosized titanium dioxide (TiO2) is genotoxic. The significance of these findings with respect to in vivo effects is unclear, as few in vivo studies on TiO2 genotoxicity exist. Recently, nanosized TiO2 administered in drinking water was reported to increase, e.g., micronuclei (MN) in peripheral blood polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) and DNA damage in leukocytes. Induction of micronuclei in mouse PCEs was earlier also described for pigment-grade TiO2 administered intraperitoneally. The apparent systemic genotoxic effects have been suggested to reflect secondary genotoxicity of TiO2 due to inflammation. However, a recent study suggested that induction of DNA damage in mouse bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells after intratracheal instillation of nanosized or fine TiO2 is independent of inflammation. We examined here, if inhalation of freshly generated nanosized TiO2 (74% anatase, 26% brookite; 5 days, 4\u00a0h/day) at 0.8, 7.2, and (the highest concentration allowing stable aerosol production) 28.5\u00a0mg/m3 could induce genotoxic effects in C57BL/6J mice locally in the lungs or systematically in peripheral PCEs. DNA damage was assessed by the comet assay in lung epithelial alveolar type II and Clara cells sampled immediately following the exposure. MN were analyzed by acridine orange staining in blood PCEs collected 48\u00a0h after the last exposure. A dose-dependent deposition of Ti in lung tissue was seen. Although the highest exposure level produced a clear increase in neutrophils in BAL fluid, indicating an inflammatory effect, no significant effect on the level of DNA damage in lung epithelial cells or micronuclei in PCEs was observed, suggesting no genotoxic effects by the 5-day inhalation exposure to nanosized TiO2 anatase. Our inhalation exposure resulted in much lower systemic TiO2 doses than the previous oral and intraperitoneal treatments, and lung epithelial cells probably received considerably less TiO2 than BAL cells in the earlier intratracheal study.",

However, direct translocation of NM from mother to fetus through the placenta is limited. The present study tests the hypothesis that pulmonary exposure to NM and NM-induced response, such as inflammation during gestation, leads to secondary effects in the fetus. Time-mated C57BL/6BomTac mice were exposed by intratracheal instillation to vehicle (Nanopure water) or one of three concentrations (2.75, 13.5 or 67\u00a0\u03bcg in 40\u00a0\u03bcl Nanopure water) of carbon black Printex 90 (CB) on gestational days 7, 10, 15 and 18, to final cumulative doses of 11, 54 or 268\u00a0\u03bcg/animal. Samples from a subset of male and female newborns were collected on postnatal day 2 (4\u00a0days after the last maternal exposure) and from dams 26 to 27\u00a0days post-exposure (post-weaning period). Histopathology, DNA microarrays, pathway-specific RT-PCR arrays, focussed RT-PCR, and tissue protein analysis were employed to characterize pulmonary response in dams exposed to CB during pregnancy. Hepatic gene expression in newborns was interpreted in light of the observed biological responses and gene expression changes arising in the lungs of dams following CB exposure. Although retention of CB particles was observed in dams from both the medium and the high dose groups, neutrophil-marked inflammation and altered expression of several cytokines and chemokines, both at the transcriptional and tissue protein levels, was significant only in the high dose group. Analysis of newborn livers by DNA microarrays revealed that female offspring were more sensitive to maternal exposure than male offspring. Cellular signalling, inflammation, cell cycle and lipid metabolism were among the biological pathways affected in female offspring. Males, however, responded with subtle changes in metabolism-related genes. Further investigation is required to determine the long-term health consequences of the gene expression changes in offspring and response to environmental stresses.",

     "abstract": "Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles are finding applications in a wide range of products including cosmetics, food packaging, imaging, etc. This increases the likelihood of human exposure to these nanoparticles through dermal, inhalation and oral routes. Presently, the majority of the studies concerning ZnO nanoparticle toxicity have been conducted using in vitro systems which lack the complex cell\u2013cell, cell\u2013matrix interactions and hormonal effects found in the in vivo scenario. The present in vivo study in mice was aimed at investigating the oral toxicity of ZnO nanoparticles. Our results showed a significant accumulation of nanoparticles in the liver leading to cellular injury after sub-acute oral exposure of ZnO nanoparticles (300\u00a0mg/kg) for 14 consecutive days. This was evident by the elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) serum levels and pathological lesions in the liver. ZnO nanoparticles were also found to induce oxidative stress indicated by an increase in lipid peroxidation. The DNA damage in the liver and kidney cells of mice was evaluated by the Fpg-modified Comet assay which revealed a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increase in the Fpg-specific DNA lesions in liver indicating oxidative stress as the cause of DNA damage. The TUNEL assay revealed an induction of apoptosis in the liver of mice exposed to ZnO nanoparticles compared to the control. Our results conclusively demonstrate that sub-acute oral exposure to ZnO nanoparticles in mice leads to an accumulation of nanoparticles in the liver causing oxidative stress mediated DNA damage and apoptosis. These results also suggest the need for a complete risk assessment of any new engineered nanoparticle before its arrival into the consumer market.",

In the present study, marine mussels (Mytilus sp.) were exposed for 3 days to C60 fullerenes (C60; 0.10\u20131\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121) and a model polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), fluoranthene (32\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0l\u22121), either alone or in combination. The first two experiments were conducted by exposing the organisms to different concentrations of C60 and fluoranthene alone, in order to determine the effects on total glutathione levels (as a measure of generic oxidative stress), genotoxicity (DNA strand breaks using Comet assay in haemocytes), DNA adduct analyses (using 32P-postlabelling method) in different organs, histopathological changes in different tissues (i.e. adductor muscle, digestive gland and gills) and physiological effects (feeding or clearance rate). Subsequently, in the third experiment, a combined exposure of C60 plus fluoranthene (0.10\u00a0mg\u00a0l\u22121 and 32\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0l\u22121, respectively) was carried out to evaluate all endpoints mentioned above. Both fluoranthene and C60 on their own caused concentration-dependent increases in DNA strand breaks as determined by the Comet assay. Formation of DNA adducts however could not be detected for any exposure conditions. Combined exposure to C60 and fluoranthene additively enhanced the levels of DNA strand breaks along with a 2-fold increase in the total glutathione content. In addition, significant accumulation of C60 was observed in all organs, with highest levels in digestive gland (24.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.91\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0C60\u00a0g\u22121\u00a0ww). Interestingly, clear signs of abnormalities in adductor muscle, digestive gland and gills were observed by histopathology. Clearance rates indicated significant differences compared to the control with exposure to C60, and C60/fluoranthene combined treatments, but not after fluoranthene exposure alone. This study demonstrated that at the selected concentrations, both C60 and fluoranthene evoke toxic responses and genetic damage. The combined exposure produced enhanced damage with additive rather than synergistic effects.",

These agents were tested either individually or as a combination at two concentrations (with a 10-fold difference) against the genotoxins mitomycin C (MMC), diepoxybutane (DEB) and patulin (PAT). Our preliminary ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay demonstrated additive effects when PEL, CLA, RES and EGCG were combined. Results of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test showed significant protection against genotoxic damage induced by PAT, DEB and MMC when CLA, PEL, RES and EGCG were tested individually. This protective effect of the phytochemicals was not concentration-related. Both low- and high-concentration combinations of CLA, PEL, RES and EGCG showed significant reducing effects on the frequencies of micronuclei induced by PAT, DEB and MMC. However, the micronucleus test did not provide indications of additive or synergistic effects with this combination of phytochemicals. In conclusion, the chemo-preventive effects of PEL, CLA, RES and EGCG against genotoxic damage induced by MMC, DEB and PAT are indicative of a \u2018saturation effect\u2019 when higher concentrations and combinations of these phytochemicals are used.",

Fluorescence quenching revealed high binding affinity (Ka\u00a0=\u00a05.62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0M\u22121) of phorate to ctDNA. Molecular modeling of the phorate\u2013ctDNA interaction suggested the binding of phorate at AT rich regions on minor groove of DNA. The interaction ensued alkylation of the N-6, N-7 of adenine and C-4 carbonyl oxygen of thymine. Binding of phorate was stronger in the presence of the transition metal ion copper II (Cu2+), and has accentuated the destabilization of the DNA secondary structure. A discernable change in the voltammetric E1/2 (E0\u2032) with lesser cathodic (ipc) and anodic (ipa) peak currents confirmed the formation of phorate\u2013DNA and phorate\u2013DNA\u2013Cu (II) association complexes. Furthermore, the MTT and NRU assays demonstrated substantial phorate cytotoxicity due to loss of mitochondrial and lysosomal membrane integrity, and reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m) of treated WISH cells. Cell cycle analysis of WISH cells treated with 1000\u00a0\u03bcM phorate exhibited 13.7-fold (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) augmentation in the sub-G1 peak.

We hypothesized that the children of female cancer survivors who received radiation therapy may have an increased rate of mtDNA heteroplasmy mutations, which conceivably could increase their risk of developing cancer and other diseases. We evaluated 44 DNA blood samples from 17 Danish and 1 Finnish families (18 mothers and 26 children). All mothers had been treated for cancer as children and radiation doses to their ovaries were determined based on medical records and computational models. DNA samples were sequenced for the entire mitochondrial genome using the Illumina GAII system. Mother's age at sample collection was positively correlated with mtDNA heteroplasmy mutations. There was evidence of heteroplasmy inheritance in that 9 of the 18 families had at least one child who inherited at least one heteroplasmy site from his or her mother. No significant difference in single nucleotide polymorphisms between mother and offspring, however, was observed. Radiation therapy dose to ovaries also was not significantly associated with the heteroplasmy mutation rate among mothers and children. No evidence was found that radiotherapy for pediatric cancer is associated with the mitochondrial genome mutation rate in female cancer survivors and their children.",

The severity of colitis was assessed on the basis of clinical signs, colon length, oxidative stress parameters, various pro-inflammatory markers, histopathological evaluation and immunohistochemical staining of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine in the colon of dextran sulfate sodium treated mice. Further, assessment of genotoxicity was carried out using alkaline and modified comet assays in the colon and lymphocytes and micronucleus assay in the peripheral blood of mice. For the evaluation of inflammation-induced cell proliferation in the bone marrow, proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunostaining was carried out in the bone marrow of mice. Dextran sulfate sodium induced severe colitis as evident from the elevated disease activity index, reduced colon length, increased oxidative stress, histological abnormalities and oxidative DNA damage in the colon of mice. Moreover, colitis-induced elevated prostaglandin-E2 level in the plasma of dextran sulfate sodium treated mice stimulated the cell proliferation in the bone marrow, which further triggered colitis-induced DNA damage in the peripheral blood of mice.",

     "abstract": "In vitro cell transformation is a process characterized by a series of progressive distinctive events that often emulate manifestations occurring in vivo and which are associated with neoplasia. Attendant cellular and sub-cellular alterations include, among others: cellular immortality, phenotypic changes, aneuploidy, genetic variability, cellular disarray, anchorage-independent growth, and tumorigenicity in vivo. Early chemically induced neoplastic transformation studies involved the use of normal diploid (Syrian) hamster embryo (SHE) cells and monitored the formation of morphologically altered colonies. Later investigations employed primarily two established mouse cell lines, i.e. the BALB/c 3T3 A31 cell line and the C3H 10T 1/2 cell line, and monitored the induction of morphologically aberrant foci. In either case, such transformed cellular clusters (colonies and foci) could induce tumors upon inoculation in vivo. Some subsequent noteworthy advancements using these systems included pH adjustments, metabolic supplementation, amplification of expression of formerly latent transformed foci, concurrent detection of mutagenesis and transformation, and use of a Bhas 42 cell line (v-Ha-ras transfected BALB/c 3T3 cells) to detect both tumor initiators and promoters. Over time, such transformation assay systems have been found useful in academic, industry and regulatory laboratories, generally for research purposes, but also occasionally as screening tools for potential chemical carcinogens. Nevertheless, to date, use of these assays for decision-making purposes in the regulatory arena remains elusive and will require comprehensive validation to gain universal acceptance.",

     "abstract": "The potential for a compound to induce carcinogenicity is a key consideration when ascertaining hazard and risk assessment of chemicals. Among the in vitro alternatives that have been developed for predicting carcinogenicity, in vitro cell transformation assays (CTAs) have been shown to involve a multistage process that closely models important stages of in vivo carcinogenesis and have the potential to detect both genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens. These assays have been in use for decades and a substantial amount of data demonstrating their performance is available in the literature. However, for the standardised use of these assays for regulatory purposes, a formal evaluation of the assays, in particular focusing on development of standardised transferable protocols and further information on assay reproducibility, was considered important to serve as a basis for the drafting of generally accepted OECD test guidelines. To address this issue, a prevalidation study of the CTAs using the BALB/c 3T3 cell line, SHE cells at pH 6.7, and SHE cells at pH 7.0 was coordinated by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) and focused on issues of standardisation of protocols, test method transferability and within- and between-laboratory reproducibility. The study resulted in the availability of standardised protocols that had undergone prevalidation [1], [2]. The results of the ECVAM study demonstrated that for the BALB/c 3T3 method, some modifications to the protocol were needed to obtain reproducible results between laboratories, while the SHE pH 6.7 and the SHE pH 7.0 protocols are transferable between laboratories, and results are reproducible within- and between-laboratories. It is recommended that the BALB/c 3T3 and SHE protocols as instituted in this prevalidation study should be used in future applications of these respective transformation assays. To support their harmonised use and regulatory application, the development of an OECD test guideline for the SHE CTAs, based on the protocol published in this issue, is recommended. The development of an OECD test guideline for the BALB/c 3T3 CTA should likewise be further pursued upon the availability of additional supportive data and improvement of the statistical analysis.",

     "abstract": "The cell transformation assays (CTAs) have attracted attention within the field of alternative methods due to their potential to reduce the number of animal experiments in the field of carcinogenicity. The CTA using BALB/c 3T3 cells has proved to be able to respond to chemical carcinogens by inducing morphologically transformed foci. Although a considerable amount of data on the performance of the assay has been collected, a formal evaluation focusing particularly on reproducibility, and a standardised protocol were considered important. Therefore the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) decided to coordinate a prevalidation study of the BALB/c 3T3 CTA. Three different laboratories from Japan and Europe participated. In the study the following modules were assessed stepwise: test definition (Module 1) consisted of the standardisation of the protocol, the selection of the cell lineage, and the preparation of a photo catalogue on the transformed foci. The within-laboratory reproducibility (Module 2) and the transferability (Module 3) were assessed using non-coded and coded 3-methylcholanthrene. Then, five coded chemicals were tested for the assessment of between-laboratory reproducibility (Module 4). All three laboratories obtained positive results with benzo[a]pyrene, phenanthrene and o-toluidine HCl. 2-Acetylaminofluorene was positive in two laboratories and equivocal in one laboratory. Anthracene was negative in all three laboratories. The chemicals except phenanthrene, which is classified by IARC (http://monographs.iarc.fr) as group 3 \u201cnot classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to human\u201d, were correctly predicted as carcinogens. Further studies on phenanthrene will clarify this discrepancy. Thus, although only a few chemicals were tested, it can be seen that the predictive capacity of the BALB/c 3T3 CTA is satisfactory.On the basis of the outcome of this study, an improved protocol, incorporating some changes related to data interpretation, has been developed. It is recommended that this protocol be used in the future to provide more data that may confirm the robustness of this protocol and the performance of the assay itself. During the study it became clear that selecting the most appropriate concentrations for the transformation assay is crucial.",

Whereas a standard statistical approach for the Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) CTA was considered sufficient, an international expert group was gathered by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) to review commonly applied statistical approaches for BALB/c 3T3 CTA. As it was concluded that none of the commonly applied approaches is entirely appropriate, two novel statistical approaches were found to be recommended for the evaluation of BALB/c 3T3 CTA data accounting for possible non-monotone concentration\u2013response relationship and variance heterogeneity: a negative binomial generalised linear model with William's-type downturn-protected trend tests and a normalisation of the data by a specific transformation allowing for application of a general linear model that estimates effects assuming a normal distribution with William's-type protected tests. Both approaches are described in this article and their performance and the quality of the results they generate is demonstrated using exemplary data. Our work confirmed that both approaches are suitable for the statistical analysis of BALB/c 3T3 CTA data and that each of them is superior to commonly used methods. Furthermore, a procedure dichotomising data into negatives and positives is proposed which allows re-testing in cases where inconclusive data are encountered.

     "abstract": "The Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cell transformation assay (CTA) is an important in vitro method that is highly predictive of rodent carcinogenicity. It is a key method for reducing animal usage for carcinogenicity prediction. The SHE assay has been used for many years primarily to investigate and identify potential rodent carcinogens thereby reducing the number of 2-year bioassays performed in rodents. As for other assays with a long history of use, the SHE CTA has not undergone formal validation. To address this, the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) coordinated a prevalidation study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the within-laboratory reproducibility, test method transferability, and between-laboratory reproducibility and to develop a standardised state-of-the-art protocol for the SHE CTA at pH 6.7. Formal ECVAM principles for criteria on reproducibility (including the within-laboratory reproducibility, the transferability and the between-laboratories reproducibility) were applied. In addition to the assessment of reproducibility, this study helped define a standard protocol for use in developing an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) test guideline for the SHE CTA. Six compounds were evaluated in this study: benzo(a)pyrene, 3-methylcholanthrene, o-toluidine HCl, 2,4-diaminotoluene, phthalic anhydride and anthracene.

SHE cells are \u201cnormal\u201d cells since they are diploid, genetically stable, non-tumourigenic, and have metabolic capabilities for the activation of some classes of carcinogens. The CTA, first developed in the 1960s by Berwald and Sachs (1963,1964) [3], [4], is based on the change of the phenotypic feature of cell colonies expressing the first steps of the conversion of normal to neoplastic-like cells with oncogenic properties. Pienta et al. (1977) [22] developed a protocol using cryopreserved cells to enhance practicality of the assay and limit sources of variability. Several variants of the assay are currently in use, which mainly differ by the pH at which the assay is performed. We present here the common version of the SHE pH 6.7 CTA and SHE pH 7.0 CTA protocols used in the ECVAM (European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods) prevalidation study on CTA reported in this issue.

The seventh amendment to the European Cosmetics Directive will ban in 2013 the marketing of cosmetic and personal care products that contain ingredients that have been tested in animal models. Thus 2-year rodent bioassays will not be available for cosmetics/personal care products. Furthermore, for large testing programs like REACH, in vivo carcinogenicity testing is impractical. Alternative ways to carcinogenicity assessment are urgently required. In terms of standardization and validation, the most advanced in vitro tests for carcinogenicity are the cell transformation assays (CTAs). Although CTAs do not mimic the whole carcinogenesis process in vivo, they represent a valuable support in identifying transforming potential of chemicals. CTAs have been shown to detect genotoxic as well as non-genotoxic carcinogens and are helpful in the determination of thresholds for genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens.

     "abstract": "Organophosphate herbicides are among the most dangerous agrochemicals for the aquatic environment. In this context, Roundup\u00ae, a glyphosate-based herbicide, has been widely detected in natural water bodies, representing a potential threat to non-target organisms, namely fish. Thus, the main goal of the present study was to evaluate the genotoxic potential of Roundup\u00ae in the teleost fish Anguilla anguilla, addressing the possible causative involvement of oxidative stress. Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of this herbicide (58 and 116\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121) during one or three days. The standard procedure of the comet assay was applied to gill and liver cells in order to determine organ-specific genetic damage. Since liver is a central organ in xenobiotic metabolism, nucleoids of hepatic cells were also incubated with a lesion-specific repair enzyme (formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase \u2013 FPG), in order to recognise oxidised purines. Antioxidants were determined in both organs as indicators of pro-oxidant state. In general, both organs displayed an increase in DNA damage for the two Roundup\u00ae concentrations and exposure times, although liver showed to be less susceptible to the lower concentration. The enzyme-modified comet assay showed the occurrence of FPG-sensitive sites in liver only after a 3-day exposure to the higher Roundup\u00ae concentration. The antioxidant defences were in general unresponsive, despite a single increment of catalase activity in gills (116\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121, 3-day) and a decrease of superoxide dismutase activity in liver (58\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0L\u22121, 3-day). Overall, the mechanisms involved in Roundup\u00ae-induced DNA strand-breaks showed to be similar in both organs. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the type of DNA damage varies with the concentration and exposure duration. Hence, after 1-day exposure, an increase on pro-oxidant state is not a necessary condition for the induction of DNA-damaging effects of Roundup\u00ae. By increasing the duration of exposure to three days, ROS-dependent processes gained preponderance as a mechanism of DNA-damage induction in the higher concentration.",

     "abstract": "The need to assess the ability of a chemical to act as a mutagen is one of the primary requirements in regulatory toxicology. Several pieces of legislation have led to an increased interest in the use of in silico methods, specifically the formation of chemical categories and read-across for the assessment of toxicological endpoints. One of the key steps in the development of chemical categories for mutagenicity is defining the mechanistic organic chemistry associated with the formation of a covalent bond between DNA and an exogenous chemical. To this end this study has analysed, by use of a large set of mutagenicity data (Ames test), the mechanistic coverage of a recently published set of in silico structural alerts developed for category formation. The results show that the majority of chemicals with a positive result in the Ames test were assigned at least one covalent binding mechanism related to the formation of a DNA adduct. The remaining chemicals with positive data in the Ames assay were subjected to a detailed mechanistic analysis from which 26 new structural alerts relating to covalent binding mechanisms were developed. In addition, structural alerts for radical and non-covalent intercalation mechanisms were also defined. The structural alerts outlined in this study are not intended to predict mutagenicity but rather to identify mechanisms associated with covalent and non-covalent DNA binding. This mechanistic profiling information can then be used to form chemical categories suitable for filling data gaps via read-across. A strategy for chemical category formation for mutagenicity is also presented.",

Results derived from the analysis of macroscopic parameters used in testing for general toxicity, revealed that while di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate had no apparent effects, the other two chemicals inhibited A. cepa root growth in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, although all three compounds caused alterations in the mitotic index of root-tip cells, propylparaben was the only one that did not show evidence of genotoxicity in assays for chromosome aberrations and micronuclei.

Damage in somatic cells such as lymphocytes could give rise to cancer, while damage in germ cells could not only give rise to cancer but also to heritable defects. The alkaline Comet assay, with and without metabolic activation, as well as the neutral Comet assay were used to assess DNA integrity in spermatozoa and lymphocytes after in vitro treatment with low, middle and high doses of each chemical. DNA-reactive aldehydes generated by lipid peroxidation, food mutagens such as heterocyclic amines, nitrosamine and benzo[a]pyrene produced the highest amounts of DNA damage, even without metabolic activation. Damage seen with the neutral Comet assay \u2013 detecting primarily double-strand breaks \u2013 was lower than with the alkaline assay. In general, there was increased damage in the spermatozoa by comparison with the lymphocytes, with altered slopes in the dose\u2013response curves. The Comet assay with sperm was generally very sensitive in assessing genotoxic damage, with the Comet parameters being good biomarkers of induced DNA damage. Establishing reliable biomarkers of exposure for the evaluation of dietary/environmental carcinogens is of utmost importance to protect our health and the health of our offspring.",

Although the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) test for the detection of cells that have divided once is routinely used and currently accepted by regulatory agencies, it has some limitations. Reconstituted human epidermis (RHE) is widely used in safety assessments because its physiological properties resemble those of the skin, and because it allows testing of substances such as hydrophobic compounds. Thus, the micronucleus test is being adapted for application in RHE-reconstructed tissues.Here we investigated whether two different reconstructed epidermis models (EPI/001 from Straticell, and RHE/S/17 from Skinethic) are suitable for application of the micronucleus test. We found that acetone does not modify micronucleus frequency, cell viability, and model structure, compared with non-treated RHE. Treatment of the EPI/001 model with mitomycin C and vinblastine resulted in a dose-dependent increase of micronucleus frequency as well as a decrease of tissue viability and of binucleated cell rate, while no changes of the epidermal structure were observed. The number of binucleated cells obtained with the RHE/S/17 model was too small to permit micronucleus testing. These results indicate that the proliferative rate of the tissue used is a critical parameter in performing the micronucleus test on a 3D model.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the combined in vivo skin comet assay and in vivo skin micronucleus (MN) test using the same animal to explore the usefulness of the new test method.The combined alkaline comet assay and MN test was carried out with three chemicals: 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). In the first experiment, we compared DNA- and chromosome-damaging effects of 3 [72, 24 and 3\u00a0hours (h) before sacrifice] and 4 applications (72, 48, 24 and 3\u00a0h before sacrifice) of 4NQO, which induces dermal irritancy. The animals were euthanized and their skin was sampled for the combination test. As a result, the 4-application method was able to detect both DNA- and chromosome-damaging potential with a lower concentration; therefore, in the second experiment, MNNG and B[a]P were topically applied four times, respectively. The animals were euthanized, and then their skins were sampled for combination tests. In the alkaline comet assay, significant differences in the percent of DNA (%DNA) in the tail were observed in epidermal skin cells treated with MNNG and B[a]P. In the MN test, an increased frequency of MN cells (%MN) cells was observed by treatment with MNNG; however, there were no significant increases. In contrast, significant differences in %MN were observed by treatment with B[a]P.From these results, we conclude that the combined in vivo skin comet assay and in vivo MN test was useful because it can detect different genotoxicity with the same sampling time and reduce the number of animals used.",

Aristolochic acid I (AAI) and aristolochic acid II (AAII), the two major components of AA, differ from each other by a single methoxy group. However, their individual mutagenic characteristics in vivo are unclear. In the present study, we compared their DNA adduct formation and mutagenicities in the gpt delta transgenic mouse kidney. The dA-AAI, dG-AAI, dA-AAII and dG-AAII were identified in the kidney two days after intragastric administration of AAI or AAII at 5\u00a0mg/kg. The concentration of DNA adducts formed by AAII was approximately 2.5-fold higher than that formed by AAI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The mutant frequency induced by AAII was nearly two-fold higher than that induced by AAI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) following administration of 5\u00a0mg/kg AAI or AAII, five times per week for six weeks. Investigation of the mutation spectra showed no statistically significant difference between AAI- and AAII-treated mice (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). A:T to T:A transversion was the predominant type of mutation in both treated groups, the GC-associated mutation rates, however, differed between the AAI and AAII treatments. The in vivo metabolic pathways of AAI and AAII are different, and this may affect their mutagenicity. In the present study, we measured the levels of AAI and AAII in the kidney and plasma of gpt delta transgenic mice at multiple time points after a single intragastric dose of 1 or 5\u00a0mg/kg of either component. Our results showed that the levels of AAII in both kidney and plasma were considerably higher than those of AAI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The present study indicated that AAII showed more carcinogenic risk than AAI in vivo, and this may be, at least partly, the result of its increased levels in kidney and plasma.",

Incubation of BP (1\u00a0\u03bcM) with rat liver microsomes, appropriate co-factors and DNA in the presence of vehicle or punicalagin (1\u201340\u00a0\u03bcM) showed dose-dependent inhibition of the resultant DNA adducts, with essentially complete (97%) inhibition at 40\u00a0\u03bcM. However, PC failed to inhibit anti-BPDE-induced DNA adducts when tested in an in vitro non-microsomal system, suggesting that the inhibition of the microsomal BP\u2013DNA adducts occurred due to inhibition of P450 1A1 by PC. To determine its efficacy in vivo, female S/D rats were administered punicalagin via the diet (1500\u00a0ppm; \u223c19\u00a0mg/day/animal) or subcutaneous polymeric implants (two 2-cm, 200\u00a0mg with 20% drug load; 40\u00a0mg PC/implant) and then treated with continuous low-dose of BP by a subcutaneous polymeric implant (2\u00a0cm, 200\u00a0mg with 10% load; 20\u00a0mg BP/implant) and euthanized after 10 days. Analysis of the lung DNA by 32P-postlabeling showed significant (60%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) inhibition of DNA adducts by PC administered via the implants; the dietary route showed modest (34%) but statistically insignificant inhibition. Furthermore, total PC administered by implants was approximately 38-fold lower compared with the dietary route. Analysis of the lung microsomes showed significant inhibition of cytochrome P450 1A1 activity and induction of glutathione. Release of PC from the implants was found to be biphasic starting with a burst release, followed by a gradual decline. Ultra performance liquid chromatography analysis showed no detectable PC in the plasma but its hydrolyzed product, ellagic acid was readily detected. The plasma concentration of ellagic acid was over two orders of magnitude higher (589\u00a0\u00b1\u00a078\u00a0ng/mL) in the implant group compared with diet (4.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.83\u00a0ng/mL). Together, our data show that delivery of PC by implants can reduce its effective dose substantially, and that the inhibition of DNA adducts in vivo occurred presumably due to the conversion of PC to ellagic acid.",

Results showed that when the rats were exposed to low dose (LD) Cd of 0.1\u00a0mg CdCl2/(kg\u00a0d) for 8 and 12 weeks, the Cd concentration in blood reached to 135\u2013140\u00a0\u03bcg/L and no toxic effects on peripheral blood lymphocytes, white blood cells (WBC) and granulocyte\u2013monocyte (GM) progenitor cells were observed except polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) of bone marrow. Moreover, this chronic LD Cd exposure significantly decreased irradiation-induced micronucleus (MN) formation and hypoxanthine\u2013guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) mutation in lymphocytes and PCE, while the combination of LD Cd exposure and irradiation induced the additive metallothionein (MT) protein expression in bone marrow cells. When the rats were exposed to a high dose (HD) Cd of 0.5\u00a0mg CdCl2/(kg\u00a0d) for 8 and 12 weeks, the blood Cd level approached to 458\u2013613\u00a0\u03bcg/L and an inflammatory response was induced, meanwhile, MN formation and hprt mutation were markedly increased, and the ratio of PCE/NCE (normochromatic erythrocyte) was significantly decreased. Furthermore, when the rats were exposed to HD Cd plus 2\u00a0Gy irradiation, additive toxic effects on MN formation, hprt mutation, PCE damage and GM progenitor cell proliferation were observed, while this combination treatment resulted in an obvious reduction of MT protein compared to HD Cd group. In conclusion, chronic exposure to LD Cd induced the adaptive response to irradiation in the genotoxicity of peripheral blood lymphocytes and PCE of bone marrow by the up-regulation of Cd-induced MT protein, but the combination of HD Cd exposure and irradiation generated the additive effects on the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in peripheral blood lymphocytes and bone marrow cells.",

Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression in the transformed cell were analyzed to determine the role of miRNAs in MC-LR-induced carcinogenesis. Cultured WRL-68 cells (labeled 25MC10) were continuously exposed to a low concentration (10\u00a0\u03bcg/L) of MC-LR for 25 passages. Compared with the mock-treated parental cells, the induced 25MC10 cells exhibited a higher growth rate, resistance to serum-induced terminal differentiation, and tumorigenicity in a nude mouse xenograft test. A pilot miRNA expression array analysis was conducted on the 25MC10 cells, followed by validation of select miRNAs by RT-PCR. We found that the onco-miRNAs miR-21 and miR-221 displayed upregulated expression while the liver-specific miR-122 was downregulated. These results suggest that chronic MC-LR exposure alters the miRNA expression profile of WRL-68 cells and causes phenotypic transformation.

     "abstract": "Bisphenol A (BPA) is a well-known endocrine disruptor (ED) which represents a major toxicological and public health concern due to its widespread exposure to humans. BPA has been reported to induce DNA adduct and aneuploidy in rodents. Recent studies in humans depicted its association with recurrent miscarriages and male infertility due to sperm DNA damage indicating that BPA might have genotoxic activity. Hence, the present study was designed to determine genotoxic and mutagenic effects of BPA using in-vivo and in-vitro assays. The adult male and female rats were orally administered with various doses of BPA (2.4\u00a0\u03bcg, 10\u00a0\u03bcg, 5\u00a0mg and 50\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0bw) once a day for six consecutive days. Animals were sacrificed, bone marrow and blood samples were collected and subjected to series of genotoxicity assay such as micronucleus, chromosome aberration and single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay respectively. Mutagenicity was determined using tester strains of Salmonella typhimurium (TA 98, TA 100 and TA 102) in the presence and absence of metabolically active microsomal fractions (S9). Further, we estimated the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, lipid per-oxidation and glutathione activity to decipher the potential genotoxic mechanism of BPA. We observed that BPA exposure caused a significant increase in the frequency of micronucleus (MN) in polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs), structural chromosome aberrations in bone marrow cells and DNA damage in blood lymphocytes. These effects were observed at various doses tested except 2.4\u00a0\u03bcg compared to vehicle control. We did not observe the mutagenic response in any of the tester strains tested at different concentrations of BPA. We found an increase in the level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine in the plasma and increase in lipid per-oxidation and decrease in glutathione activity in liver of rats respectively which were exposed to BPA. In conclusion, the data obtained clearly documents that BPA is not mutagenic but exhibit genotoxic activity and oxidative stress could be one of the mechanisms leading to genetic toxicity.",

     "abstract": "This report is part of a biomarker study conducted in an Italian population with exposure to environmental benzene ranging from 1.43 to 31.41\u00a0\u03bcg/m3 (values from personal sampling). DNA damage induced by benzene is the crucial mechanism of its genotoxicity, which leads to chronic benzene poisoning, haematotoxicity and leukaemia. Therefore, genetic variation in DNA-repair genes may modulate susceptibility to benzene-induced DNA damage. In light of this, the effects of polymorphisms in DNA-repair genes (APEX1, hOGG1, NBS1, XPD, XRCC1, and XRCC3) on micronucleus (MN) formation as a biomarker of early biological effects were evaluated. A significantly higher median MN frequency was recorded in traffic wardens than in controls. However, none of the analysed polymorphisms was significantly associated with the median MN frequency. A gene\u2013gender interaction was observed for the APEX1 genotype. The APEX1 variant genotype was associated with significantly lower median MN frequency in men, not in women. Statistical analysis did not reveal any association between the score of the protective alleles \u2013 hypothetically pushing the pathway towards optimal DNA-damage repair \u2013 and MN. Even though there are some limitations in the study, our results indicate that the general population may be exposed to benzene concentrations higher than the threshold level for air-quality standards in the European Union of 10\u00a0\u03bcg/m3. Furthermore, urban traffic wardens are exposed to significantly higher levels of benzene than individuals spending most of the time indoors. This higher exposure may contribute to DNA damage, suggesting that benzene might be implicated both as an environmental and occupational risk factor in leukaemia and other haematological diseases. In conclusion, this study suggest the need for (i) regular monitoring of traffic wardens for possible exposure to benzene, as a precautionary step to reduce the associated health risks, and (ii) more comprehensive studies in order to better elucidate the involvement of APEX1 genotypes in benzene genotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) are recognized as common environmental pollutants released into the environment from many natural as well as man-made sources, and some have been classified as potent carcinogens. The main representative of the carcinogenic PAH is benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) which is known to induce genotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo, detected as PAH\u2013DNA adducts. Long-term PAH exposure may be accompanied by an immunological response with the formation of antibodies against PAH as well as against PAH\u2013DNA adducts. This paper describes the use of four PAH\u2013keyhole-limpet haemocyanin (KLH) conjugates for the induction of specific and cross-reactive anti-PAH antibodies and focuses on the potential protective effects of anti-PAH antibodies produced after immunization of mice. In the in vitro experiments with HepG-2 cells, the genotoxicity of the PAH\u2013KLH conjugates and the neutralizing effect of induced anti-PAH antibodies were evaluated. The titer of specific anti-PAH antibodies in sera and the amounts of DNA adducts in liver homogenates from immunized mice were investigated in vivo. The results show that anti-PAH antibodies of class IgG were induced during immunization. All the PAH\u2013KLH conjugates tested were non-genotoxic and did not induce detectable DNA adducts in HepG2 cells or in the liver of immunized mice. The results show that only B(a)P-specific and B(a)P cross-reactive antibodies are able to neutralize B(a)P or its activated metabolites, which was revealed by a sudden decrease in the titer of anti-B(a)P antibodies in mouse sera after exposure to B(a)P. Furthermore, the anti-B(a)P antibodies produced by immunization were effective in reducing the amount of DNA adducts in mouse livers after intraperitoneal (i.p.) exposure to B(a)P. The results suggest that immunization with PAH\u2013KLH conjugates can protect organisms against the adverse effects of carcinogenic PAH.",

     "abstract": "Current in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity assays show a high rate of positive results, many of which are misleading when compared with in vivo genotoxicity or rodent carcinogenicity data. P53-deficiency in many of the rodent cell lines may be a key factor in this poor predictivity. As part of an European Cosmetics Industry Association initiative for improvement of in vitro mammalian cell assays, we have compared several rodent cell lines (V79, CHL, CHO) with p53-competent human peripheral blood lymphocytes (HuLy), TK6 human lymphoblastoid cells, and the human liver cell line, HepG2. We have compared in vitro micronucleus (MN) induction following treatment with 19 compounds that were accepted as producing misleading or \u201cfalse\u201d positive results in in vitro mammalian cell assays [6]. Of these, six chemicals (2-ethyl-1,3-hexandiol, benzyl alcohol, urea, sodium saccharin, sulfisoxazole and isobutyraldehyde) were not toxic and did not induce any MN at concentrations up to 10\u00a0mM. d,l-Menthol and ethionamide induced cytotoxicity, but did not induce MN. o-Anthranilic acid was not toxic and did not induce MN in V79, CHL, CHO, HuLy and HepG2 cells up to 10\u00a0mM. Toxicity was induced in TK6 cells, although there were no increases in MN frequency up to and above the 55% toxicity level. The other 10 chemicals (1,3-dihydroxybenzene, curcumin, propyl gallate, p-nitrophenol, ethyl acrylate, eugenol, tert-butylhydroquinone, 2,4-dichlorophenol, sodium xylene sulfonate and phthalic anhydride) produced cytotoxicity in at least one cell type, and were evaluated further for MN induction in most or all of the cell types listed above. All these chemicals induced MN at concentrations <10\u00a0mM, with levels of cytotoxicity below 60% (measured as the replication index) in at least one cell type. The rodent cell lines (V79, CHO and CHL) were consistently more susceptible to cytotoxicity and MN induction than p53-competent cells, and are therefore more susceptible to giving misleading positive results. These data suggest that a reduction in the frequency of misleading positive results can be achieved by careful selection of the mammalian cell type for genotoxicity testing.",

We performed the Comet assay using a simple mincing method in which tissues are minced with scissors. We then compared data obtained with this method with data obtained using the scraping method. Sprague\u2013Dawley rats of both sexes were orally given twice the known carcinogens N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS), or o-anisidine (OA). Three hours after the second administration, the bladder of each rat was divided into two parts and each part was processed by either the mincing or the scraping method. Both mincing and scraping methods detected DNA damage in MNU-, EMS-, but not OA-treated rats, and thus the mincing method had a sufficient capability to detect DNA damaging agents. The morphological analysis of the prepared cell suspensions revealed that more than 80% of the cells collected by the mincing method were from the epithelium. Because the mincing method requires only one-half of a bladder, the other half remains intact and can be used for histopathological examination. We conclude that the mincing method is easier and more appropriate for the Comet assay in urinary bladder tissue than the scraping method.",

Following proper optimisation, the application and effectiveness of the comet assay in erythrocytes of A. fasciatus were tested by measuring the tail DNA (%) induced by (a) in vivo exposure of individual fish to X-rays (dose, 3\u00a0Gy) and (b) following in vitro challenge of erythrocytes with restriction endonucleases Fok-I and Eco-RI, which selectively induce double-strand breaks with cohesive and blunt termini, respectively. Furthermore, in order to evaluate whether circulating fish blood contained actively proliferating cells that could influence the extent of DNA damage in control (untreated) fish, we measured the number of \u201ccomets\u201d positive for 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) by the use of anti-BrdU antibody and immuno-histochemical methods. Both treatments (i.e. with X-rays and restriction endonucleases) induced statistically significant increases in tail DNA (%) values compared with the relevant untreated controls, indicating the effectiveness of the comet assay in the erythrocytes of A. fasciatus to detect different types of DNA lesions. Results from anti-BrdU antibody labelling of erythrocytes indicated a very low percentage (5%) of \u201ccomets\u201d positive for BrdU. Following optimisation and validation of the assay under laboratory conditions, fish were collected in the Orbetello lagoon (Tuscany, Italy), considered to be a significantly polluted site. The results showed statistically significant increases for tail DNA (%) compared with corresponding values observed in erythrocytes of fish caught in the unpolluted reference site \u201cSaline di Tarquinia\u201d. The effects of physico-chemical parameters of the water (i.e., salinity, pH and oxygen content) did not significantly influence the induction of DNA damage.

Three doses of lead acetate (10, 50 and 100\u00a0mg/kg/day) were administered to rats during a 6-week period. Lymphocytes were analyzed. Lead exposure decreased glutathione (GSH) levels in blood, and at doses of 100\u00a0mg/kg/day and 50\u00a0mg/kg/day without melatonin, caused high levels of DNA damage, induced apoptosis, and altered DNA repair. Melatonin co-treatment did not attenuate the effects of lead at 100\u00a0mg/kg/day, indicating that the effect of melatonin on GSH reduction is not sufficient to reduce the genotoxic effects of lead at this high dose. After 6 weeks of treatment, decreased weight gain was observed in high lead-dose groups (100\u00a0mg/kg/day), with or without melatonin, and in medium-dose groups (50\u00a0mg/kg/day) with melatonin, compared with the control group. The protective action of melatonin against lead toxicity is dependent on the dose of lead. Further pharmacological studies are needed to determine whether melatonin acts via melatonin membrane receptors on lymphocytes.",

Norfloxacin was non-genotoxic. Ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin induced significant increases in spot frequencies in trans-heterozygous flies. To test the roles of somatic recombination and mutation in the observed genotoxicity, balancer-heterozygous flies were also analyzed. Ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin were preferential inducers of homologous recombination in proliferative cells, an event linked to loss of heterozygosity.",

DNT has been found in soil, surface water, and groundwater near ammunition production plants. The major isomers of DNT are classified as \u201clikely to cause cancer in humans.\u201d In vitro studies have provided conflicting data regarding the genotoxicity of the minor isomers. Studies indicate that metabolism in the gut and liver are necessary to convert DNT to genotoxic compounds. As such, in the present study the genotoxicity of isomers of DNT was assessed using two in vivo genotoxicity assays. The Comet assay was used to detect DNA damage in liver cells from male Sprague-Dawley rats following oral exposure (14-day) to individual isomers of DNT. The micronucleus assay was conducted using flow cytometric analysis to detect chromosomal damage in peripheral blood. Treatment with 2,3-, 3,4-, 2,4-, 2,5- and 3,5-DNT did not induce DNA damage in liver cells or increase the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RET) in peripheral blood at the doses tested. Treatment with 2,6-DNT induced DNA damage in liver tissue at all doses tested, but did not increase the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RET) in peripheral blood. Thus, 2,4-DNT and the minor isomers were not genotoxic under these test conditions, while 2,6-DNT was genotoxic in the target tissue, the liver. These results support previous research which indicated that the hepatocarcinogenicity of technical grade DNT (TG-DNT) could be attributed to the 2,6-DNT isomer.",

PAHs have genotoxic and carcinogenic properties, which depend on their metabolism. Many enzymes involved in PAH metabolism, including CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTM and GSTT are polymorphic, which may modulate the activation/deactivation of these compounds. We evaluated PAH exposure and DNA damage in children living in the vicinity of the main petrochemical complex located in the Gulf of Mexico, and explored the modulation by genetic polymorphisms of PAH excretion and related DNA damage. The participants (n\u00a0=\u00a082) were children aged 6\u201310\u00a0y attending schools near the industrial area.

The median value of 1-OHP was 0.37\u00a0\u03bcmol/mol creatinine; 59% of children had higher 1-OHP concentrations than those reported in environmentally exposed adults (0.24\u00a0\u03bcmol/mol creatinine). A stratified analysis showed increased DNA damage in children with 1-OHP concentrations greater than the median value. We observed higher 1-OHP concentrations in children with CYP1A1*2C or GSTM1*0 polymorphisms, and a positive influence of CYP1A1*2C on OTM values in children with the highest PAH exposure. The data indicate that children living in the surroundings of petrochemical industrial areas are exposed to high PAH levels, contributing to DNA damage and suggesting an increased health risk; furthermore, data suggest that polymorphisms affecting activation enzymes may modulate PAH metabolism and toxicity.",

The responses in the MN assays conducted at both sampling times, and all the gene mutation assays, were uniformly negative; however, the Comet assay was positive for the induction of liver DNA damage. As the positive responses in the Comet assay were seen only with doses in excess of the cancer bioassay doses, and at least one of these doses (30\u00a0mg/kg) produced toxicity in the liver, the overall findings from the study are consistent with furan having a predominantly nongenotoxic MOA for cancer.",

     "abstract": "Erythrocyte-based micronucleus tests have traditionally been performed with bone marrow specimens, since, in most preclinical animal models, the spleen can efficiently remove aberrant erythrocytes from the circulation. Even so, evidence is mounting that by examining tens of thousands of young (CD71-positive) circulating reticulocytes for the presence of micronuclei via flow cytometry, a sensitive assay of cytogenetic damage is realized. The work described herein was designed to test this hypothesis further, using an important preclinical toxicology model, the beagle dog. In these experiments, purebred male beagles were treated for five consecutive days with cyclophosphamide (0, 6.25, 12.5 or 25\u00a0mg/m2/day) or for two consecutive days with etoposide (0, 1.56, 6.25 or 12.5\u00a0mg/m2/day). Before treatment, and on each day of administration, blood specimens were collected and processed for flow cytometric scoring of micronucleated reticulocyte (MN-RET) frequency. Twenty-four hours after the final administration, blood MN-RET frequencies were determined via flow cytometry, and frequencies of micronucleated bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes (MN-PCE) were determined using acridine orange and May-Grunwald Giemsa staining. In the case of cyclophosphamide, elevated blood MN-RET frequencies were observed 2 days after treatment began, and the maximal frequency was achieved 1 day later. Similarly, etoposide-induced blood MN-RET were not evident 1 day after administration began, but a robust effect was apparent 2 days after treatments were initiated. Twenty-four hours after the final administrations, dose-related micronucleus responses were evident for both agents and in both blood and bone marrow compartments. Good overall agreement between MN-RET and MN-PCE frequencies was evidenced by high Spearman's correlation coefficients\u20140.89 for blood flow cytometry versus bone marrow acridine orange staining and 0.83 for blood flow cytometry versus bone marrow May-Grunwald Giemsa staining. Taken together, these results provide further support for the cross-species utility of flow cytometry-based blood MN-RET measurements.",

TiO2 particles generated \u03b3-H2AX, which was more remarkable with the smaller particles. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the generation was independent of cell cycle phases and cells which incorporated larger amounts of TiO2 particles had more significant \u03b3-H2AX. Although there are some reports that the incorporation of nanomaterials into cells generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), the level of ROS was low even if large amounts of TiO2 particles were taken-up. In addition, the generation of \u03b3-H2AX by TiO2 particles was more significant than that after treatment with hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, the generation of \u03b3-H2AX was attenuated by coating the surface of TiO2 particles with bovine serum albumin.

     "abstract": "Bladder cancer is one of the few cancers that have been linked to carcinogens in the environment and tobacco smoke. Of the carcinogens tested in mouse chemical carcinogenesis models, N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) is one that reproducibly causes high-grade, invasive cancers in the urinary bladder, but not in any other tissues. However, the basis for such a high-level tissue-specificity has not been explored. Using mutagenesis in lacI (Big Blue\u2122) mice, we show here that BBN is a potent mutagen and it causes high-level of mutagenesis specifically in the epithelial cells (urothelial) of the urinary bladder. After a 2\u20136-week treatment of 0.05% BBN in the drinking water, mutagenesis in urothelial cells of male and female mice was about two orders of magnitude greater than the spontaneous mutation background. In contrast, mutagenesis in smooth muscle cells of the urinary bladder was about five times lower than in urothelial tissue. No appreciable increase in mutagenesis was observed in kidney, ureter, liver or forestomach. In lacI (Big Blue\u2122) rats, BBN mutagenesis was also elevated in urothelial cells, albeit not nearly as profoundly as in mice. This provides a potential explanation as to why rats are less prone than mice to the formation of aggressive form of bladder cancer induced by BBN. Our results suggest that the propensity to BBN-triggered mutagenesis of urothelial cells underlies its heightened susceptibility to this carcinogen and that mutagenesis induced by BBN represents a novel model for initiation of bladder carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Genotoxic end-points are routinely measured in various sentinel organisms in aquatic environments in order to monitor the impact of water pollution on organisms. As a first step towards the evaluation of oxidative DNA damage (8-oxodG) in organisms exposed to chemical water pollution, we have optimized the association between the comet assay and the hOGG1 enzyme for use on zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) gill cells by in vitro exposure to H2O2. Firstly, we observed that in vitro exposure of D. polymorpha gill cells to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P, 98.4\u00a0nM) induced an increase of the Olive Tail Moment (OTM) in both the comet\u2013hOGG1 and comet\u2013Fpg assays, indicating that B[a]P causes oxidative DNA damage. By contrast, methylmethane sulfonate (MMS, 33\u00a0\u03bcM) only induced an increase of the Fpg-sensitive sites, indicating that MMS caused alkylating DNA damage and confirming that hOGG1 does not detect alkylating damage. Thus, the hOGG1 enzyme seems to be more specific towards oxidative DNA damage, such as 8-oxodG than Fpg. Secondly, as was observed in vitro, the in vivo exposure of D. polymorpha to B[a]P (24.6 and 98.4\u00a0nM) increased oxidative DNA damage in gill cells, whereas only Fpg-sensitive sites were detected in mussels exposed to MMS (240\u00a0\u03bcM). These results show that the comet\u2013hOGG1 assay detects oxidative DNA lesions induced in vitro by H2O2 and in vivo with BaP. The comet\u2013hOGG1 assay will be used to detect oxidative DNA lesions (8-oxodG) in mussels exposed in situ.",

Suspended particulate matter (SPM) represents a dynamic medium that may contribute to the exposure of aquatic organisms to toxic compounds in the water column of the estuary. In order to investigate major sources of mutagenic contaminants along the estuary, water samples were taken at 25\u00a0m downstream of the outlet of an industrial wastewater-treatment plant (WWTP). SPM samples were analyzed for their genotoxicity with two short-term tests, the Salmonella typhimurium mutagenicity assay (TA98\u00a0+\u00a0S9 mix) and the comet assay in the human HepG2 cell line. Sampling sites receiving effluents from a chemical dye industry and WWTP showed the highest mutagenic potencies, followed by petrochemical industries, petroleum refinery and pulp and paper mills. These data indicate that frame-shift mutagens are present in the Seine river estuary. Furthermore, the comet assay revealed the presence of compounds that were genotoxic for human hepatocytes (HepG2 cells). We also observed a high level of mutagenic potency in the sediment of the lower estuary (3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0104\u00a0revertants/g). The source of mutagenic and genotoxic compounds seems to be associated with various types of effluents discharged in the Seine river estuary. Both test systems resulted in the same assessment of the genotoxicity of particulate matter, except for three of the 14 samples, underlying the complementarity of bioassays.",

The main genotoxic effect of MTX resulting from inhibition of thymidylate synthase is mis-incorporation of uracil into DNA, which is considered essential for the effectiveness of the Protocol M in ALL IC BFM 2002/EURO LB 2002 regimens. In this study, we investigated the level of basal and induced DNA damage as well as the effectiveness of DNA repair in lymphocytes of children with ALL at four time-points during therapy with MTX and 6MP. To assess DNA damage and the efficacy of DNA repair we used the modified alkaline comet assay with uracil DNA glycosylase (Udg) and endonuclease III (EndoIII). In addition, we examined the induction of apoptosis in the lymphocytes of the patients during treatment. Finally, we compared the activity of base-excision repair (BER), involved in removal of both uracil and oxidized bases from DNA in lymphocytes of children with ALL and lymphocytes of healthy children. BER efficiency was estimated in an in vitro assay with cellular extracts and plasmid substrates of heteroduplex DNA with an AP-site. Our results indicate that there is a significant decrease in the efficacy of DNA repair associated with an increased level of uracil in DNA and induction of apoptosis during therapy. Moreover, it was found that the BER capacity was decreased in the lymphocytes of ALL patients in contrast to that in lymphocytes of healthy children. Thus, we suggest that an impairment of the BER pathway may play a role in the pathogenesis and therapy of childhood ALL.",

     "publication date": "01-2012",
     "abstract": "Cisplatin is a potent chemotherapeutic agent that has gained widespread use against various malignant tumours in a variety of human malignancies. Like other chemotherapeutic agents, cisplatin is genotoxic and apoptogenic in non-tumour cells and the formation of reactive oxygen species appears to be responsible for these toxicities. The anti-genotoxic and anti-apoptotic effects of resveratrol, a polyphenol found in numerous plant species, against cisplatin-induced genotoxicity and apoptosis in vivo were evaluated by use of standard techniques in somatic and germinal cells of mice. Pre-treatment of mice with resveratrol significantly reduced cisplatin-induced genotoxicity and apoptosis and effectively suppressed the apoptotic signalling triggered by cisplatin. The protective effect of resveratrol was found to be stronger at the higher dose, indicating the dose-dependent effect of resveratrol. Cisplatin induced marked biochemical alterations characteristic of oxidative DNA stress. Prior administration of resveratrol before the cisplatin challenge ameliorated these biochemical markers. In conclusion, this study provides evidence for the first time that resveratrol has a protective role in the abatement of cisplatin-induced genotoxicity and apoptosis in somatic and germinal cells of mice. This activity resides, at least in part, in its radical scavenger activity. Therefore, resveratrol can be a promising chemoprotective agent to avert secondary malignancies and abnormal reproductive outcomes in cured cancer patients exposed to cisplatin, without diminishing its anti-neoplastic activity.",

     "abstract": "A current concern with in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity testing is the high frequency of false or misleading positive results caused in part by the past use of excessively high test concentrations. A dataset of 249 industrial chemicals used in Japan and tested for genotoxicity was analyzed. Of these, 116 (46.6%) were positive in the in vitro chromosomal aberration (CA) test, including 6 that were positive only at test concentrations >10\u00a0mM. There were 59 CA-positive chemicals at test concentrations \u22641\u00a0mM. At >1\u00a0mM, 51 chemicals were CA-positive, including 13 Ames-positive chemicals, which were therefore not \u201cmissed\u201d by the test battery. Thus, 38 potentially positive chemicals would not have been detected in the test battery if the top test concentration was limited to 1\u00a0mM in CA test. Analysis of the relevance of CA results on the 38 missed chemicals was conducted based on a weight of evidence approach, including evaluations of effects of extreme culture conditions (low pH, high toxicity, or precipitation), in silico structural alert analysis, in vivo genotoxicity and carcinogenicity test data (where available), mode of action, or information from closely related chemicals. After an exhaustive review, there were four chemicals with some concern for human health risk assessment, nine with minimal concern, and the remaining 25 with negligible concern. We apply different top concentrations to the 38 missed chemicals to identify the most accurate approach for predicting the genotoxicity of industrial chemicals. Of these 2\u00a0mM or 1\u00a0mg/mL, whichever is higher, was the most effective in detecting these chemicals, i.e., relatively higher (8/13) or lower (17/25) detection among 13 chemicals with some or minimal concern, or 25 with negligible concern, respectively. Lower top concentration limits, 1\u00a0mM or 0.5\u00a0mg/mL, whichever is higher, are not as effective (2/13) for detecting these chemicals with concern. Therefore, we conclude 2\u00a0mM or 1\u00a0mg/mL, whichever is higher, would be an appropriate top concentration limit for testing industrial chemicals for chromosome damage.",

     "abstract": "Nonylphenol polyethoxylates (NPEOs) are non-ionic surfactants widely used for industrial and household purposes. Since biodegraded short chain NPEOs were reported to elicit estrogenic activity in organisms, numerous studies have been carried out to assess the endocrine-disrupting potential of NPEOs; however, the genotoxicity of the compounds is not fully known, let alone the relationship between the genotoxic potential and number of ethylene oxide (EO) units of NPEOs. In this study, we examined the genotoxicity of NPEO(n) having various EO units (n\u00a0=\u00a00, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40 and 70) in a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line, MCF-7, based on the phosphorylation of histone H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX), recently regarded as a sensitive marker for DNA damage. We clarified that NPEOs have the ability to form \u03b3-H2AX via activation of ATM or DNA-PK, a general signaling pathway in response to DSBs, and this ability was strongly dependent on the number of EO units, that is, NPEO(0\u201315) having smaller numbers of EO units more readily generated \u03b3-H2AX. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the generation of \u03b3-H2AX was independent of cell cycle phases. Although the mechanism by which the NPEOs generated \u03b3-H2AX was not able to be elucidated in the present study, it was clear that the involvement of reactive oxygen species and apoptotic DNA fragmentation were not causal factors. The generation of \u03b3-H2AX means the formation of DSBs, the worst type of DNA damage. The results indicated that attention should be paid to degradated short chain NPEOs and their genotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "Until recently, knowledge about the genotoxicity of roxarsone in vitro or in vivo was limited. This study assessed the genotoxicity of roxarsone in an in vitro system. Roxarsone was tested for potential genotoxicity on V79 cells by a Comet assay and a micronucleus (MN) test, exposing the cells to roxarsone (1\u2013500\u00a0\u03bcM) and to sodium arsenite (NaAsO2, 20\u00a0\u03bcM) solutions for 3\u201348\u00a0h. Roxarsone was found to be cytotoxic when assessed with a commercial cell counting kit (CCK-8) used to evaluate cell viability, and moderately genotoxic in the Comet assay and micronucleus test used to assess DNA damage. The Comet metrics (percentages TDNA, TL, TM) increased significantly in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in roxarsone-treated samples compared with PBS controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while the data from samples treated with 20\u00a0\u03bcM NaAsO2 were comparable to those from 500\u00a0\u03bcM roxarsone-treated samples. The MN frequency of V79 cells treated with roxarsone was higher than that in the negative control but lower than the frequency in cells treated with 20\u00a0\u03bcM NaAsO2. A dose- and time-dependent response in MN induction was observed at 10, 50, 100 and 500\u00a0\u03bcM doses of roxarsone after 12\u201348\u00a0h exposure time. The DNA damage in V79 cells treated with 500\u00a0\u03bcM roxarsone was similar to cells exposed to 20\u00a0\u03bcM NaAsO2. The uptake of cells was correlated with the DNA damage caused by roxarsone. This investigation depicts the genotoxic potentials of roxarsone to V79 cells, which could lead to further advanced studies on the genotoxicity of roxarsone.",

     "abstract": "Mequindox, a quinoxaline-N-dioxide derivative that possesses antibacterial properties, has been widely used as a feed additive in the stockbreeding industry in China. While recent pharmacological studies have uncovered potential hazardous effects of mequindox, exactly how mequindox induces pathological changes and the cellular responses associated with its consumption remain largely unexplored. In this study, we investigated the cellular responses associated with mequindox treatment. We report here that mequindox inhibits cell proliferation by arresting cells at the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Interestingly, this mequindox-associated deleterious effect on cell proliferation was observed in human, pig as well as chicken cells, suggesting that mequindox acts on evolutionarily conserved target(s). To further understand the mequindox\u2013host interaction and the mechanism underlying mequindox-induced cell cycle arrest, we measured the cellular content of DNA damage, which is known to perturb cell proliferation and compromise cell survival. Accordingly, using \u03b3-H2AX as a surrogate marker for DNA damage, we found that mequindox treatment induced cellular DNA damage, which paralleled the chemical-induced elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Importantly, expression of the antioxidant enzyme catalase partially alleviated these mequindox-associated effects. Taken together, our results suggest that mequindox cytotoxicity is attributable, in part, to its role as a potent inducer of DNA damage via ROS.",

Previous studies showed that low folate levels cause DNA damage, leading to chromosomal instability and aneusomy. This study seeks to confirm this finding and investigates whether the in vitro sensitivity towards aneusomy of chromosome 17 and 21 in the folate-deficient state differs between CL/P patients and controls.Epstein\u2013Barr virus-immortalized B-lymphoblasts derived from 15 CL/P children and 15 controls, were cultured in medium with high and low concentrations \u2013 approximately 40\u00a0nM and 5\u00a0nM \u2013 of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to detect specific fluorescence signals for chromosomes 17 and 21.A significant increase in aneusomy of chromosomes 17 (2.3% vs 7.6%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001) and 21 (2.5% vs 7.0%; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001) was observed after 10 days of culturing in low folate. These results were comparable in cell lines from patients and controls. Interestingly, for chromosome 17 the folate deficiency mainly resulted in an increase of monosomy (6%, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001), while for chromosome 21 the increase of trisomy was larger (4.9%, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001).These data suggest that folate deficiency is a significant risk factor in the development of aneusomy and may affect the distribution of chromosomes during cell division. The comparable aneusomy frequencies in CL/P and in controls suggest that other folate-related processes are involved in the pathogenesis of CL/P, and additional investigations are needed to identify the causal mechanisms.",

DNA TM was found increased in NAT2 slow acetylators with mild and heavy smoking habits in control subjects and workers, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The results of this study suggest that GSTM1 null genotypes, and an association of NAT2 slow acetylation genotypes with CYP2C9*3/*3 or GSTM1 null genotypes may modulate DNA damage in workers occupationally exposed to OPs.",

Soil samples were collected from Ramsar, Iran where the annual radiation absorbed dose from background radiation is substantially higher than 20\u00a0mSv/year. The soil samples were then divided into 2 separate groups including high and low natural radioactivity. The plants were continuously exposed to static magnetic field of 15\u00a0mT for 8 days, each 8\u00a0h/day. The results showed that in the plants cultivated in soils with high background natural radioactivity and low background natural radioactivity the activity of antioxidant enzymes as well as flavonoid content were lower than those of the control. Treatment of plants with static magnetic field showed similar results in terms of lowering of antioxidant defense system and increase of peroxidation of membrane lipids. Accumulation of ROS also resulted in chromosomal aberration and DNA damage. This phenomenon was more pronounced when a combination of natural radiation and treatment with static magnetic field was applied. The results suggest that exposure to static magnetic field causes accumulation of reactive oxygen species in V. faba and natural radioactivity of soil exaggerates oxidative stress.",

Ninety-five (95) (11.5%) chemicals satisfied the multiple a priori entry criteria, with a total of 107 assays. Of the assays satisfying the entry criteria, 61 involved TA100, a strain that detects base-pair substitution mutations. 29.5% (18/61) satisfied the statistical evaluative criteria for hormesis, exceeding that predicted by chance by 4.0-fold (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

     "abstract": "Lipid-peroxidation products are formed by the thermal treatment of foodstuffs, as well as by endogenous processes. In addition, they are also common environmental pollutants originating from many different sources. Since conflicting data exist on their possible risk for humans, we have selected four lipid-peroxidation products namely acrolein, crotonaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-hexenal (4-HHE) and 4-oxo-2-nonenal (4-ONE) to determine their ability to induce mutagenicity in mammalian cells. There is an important lack of mutagenicity data on mammalian cells for such products, which presents an important gap for any risk-assessment estimation. We have used the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA) to determine the mutagenic potential of these four compounds. This assay detects a broad spectrum of mutational events, from point mutations to chromosome alterations. The results obtained indicate that the four selected compounds are mutagenic in the MLA assay, showing a direct dose\u2013effect relationship. The relative mutagenic potencies according to the induced mutant frequency (IMF) are as follows: crotonaldehyde (IMF\u00a0=\u00a0758.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126), 4-ONE (IMF\u00a0=\u00a0700.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126), acrolein (IMF\u00a0=\u00a0660.5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126) and 4-HHE (IMF\u00a0=\u00a0572\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126). Although the differences between the induced mutant frequencies for these compounds are not very large, the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehyde 4-oxo-2-nonenal turned out to be the agent most mutagenic. This is because its induced mutant frequency was reached after treatment with 10\u00a0\u03bcM, while 50\u00a0\u03bcM of the other compounds was needed to reach the reported frequencies.",

     "abstract": "Aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxic and genotoxic properties of inorganic and organic mercury compounds, i.e., HgCl2 and methylmercury (MeHg). In addition, the DNA-protective and antioxidant effects of the flavonoid quercetin (QC) were studied. All experiments were conducted with human-derived liver cells (HepG2), which possess antioxidant and drug-metabolizing enzymes in an inducible form. 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and comet formation were monitored as endpoints of DNA damage. The impact of the metal compounds on the redox status was also investigated, since it is assumed that their toxic effects are due to oxidative damage. A number of biochemical parameters related to oxidative stress, namely glutathione, malondialdehyde, protein carbonyl and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured after treatment of the cells with the mercury compounds in the presence and absence of quercetin. To elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the effects of QC, three protocols (pre-, simultaneous and post-treatment) were used. Both mercury compounds (range 0.1\u20135.0\u00a0\u03bcM) caused induction of DNA migration and formation of 8-OHdG. In combination with the flavonoid (range 0.1\u20135.0\u00a0\u03bcM), DNA-protective effects of QC were observed after pre- and simultaneous treatment but not when the flavonoid was added after treatment with the metal compounds. Exposure to the metal compounds led also to substantial changes of all parameters of the redox status and co-treatment experiments with QC showed that these alterations are reversed by the flavonoid. Taken together, the results of our experiments indicate that these two mercury compounds cause DNA damage and oxidative stress in human-derived liver cells and that the flavonoid reduces these effects. Since the concentrations of the metals and of the flavonoids used in the present work reflect human exposure, our findings can be taken as an indication that QC may protect humans against the adverse effects caused by the metal.",

     "abstract": "Human exposure to microcystins, which are produced by freshwater cyanobacterial species, is of growing concern due to increasing appearance of cyanobacterial blooms as a consequence of global warming and increasing water eutrophication. Although microcystins are considered to be liver-specific, there is evidence that they may also affect other tissues. These substances have been shown to induce DNA damage in vitro and in vivo, but the mechanisms of their genotoxic activity remain unclear. In human peripheral blood lymphocytes (HPBLs) exposure to non-cytotoxic concentrations (0, 0.1, 1 and 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) of microcystin-LR (MCLR) induced a dose- and time-dependent increase in DNA damage, as measured with the comet assay. Digestion of DNA from MCLR-treated HPBLs with purified formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase (Fpg) displayed a greater number of DNA strand-breaks than non-digested DNA, confirming the evidence that MCLR induces oxidative DNA damage. With the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay no statistically significant induction of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds was observed after a 24-h exposure to MCLR. At the molecular level, no changes in the expression of selected genes involved in the cellular response to DNA damage and oxidative stress were observed after a 4-h exposure to MCLR (1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). After 24\u00a0h, DNA damage-responsive genes (p53, mdm2, gadd45a, cdkn1a), a gene involved in apoptosis (bax) and oxidative stress-responsive genes (cat, gpx1, sod1, gsr, gclc) were up-regulated. These results provide strong support that MCLR is an indirectly genotoxic agent, acting via induction of oxidative stress, and that lymphocytes are also the target of microcystin-induced toxicity.",

Lead-induced DNA damage in V. faba roots was evaluated by use of the comet assay, which allowed the detection of DNA strand-breakage and with the V. faba micronucleus test, which revealed chromosome aberrations. The results clearly indicate that lead induced DNA fragmentation in a dose-dependant manner with a maximum effect at 10\u00a0\u03bcM. In addition, at this concentration, DNA damage time-dependently increased until 12\u00a0h. Then, a decrease in DNA damages was recorded. The significant induction of micronucleus formation also reinforced the genotoxic character of this metal. Direct interaction of lead with DNA was also evaluated with the a-cellular comet assay. The data showed that DNA breakages were not associated with a direct effect of lead on DNA. In order to investigate the relationship between lead genotoxicity and oxidative stress, V. faba were exposed to lead in the presence or absence of the antioxidant Vitamin E, or the NADPH-oxidase inhibitor dephenylene iodonium (DPI). The total inhibition of the genotoxic effects of lead (DNA breakage and micronucleus formation) by these compounds reveals the major role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the genotoxicity of lead. These results highlight, for the first time in vivo and in whole-plant roots, the relationship between ROS, DNA strand-breaks and chromosome aberrations induced by lead.",

For this, Ag-NPs were completely dispersed in medium by sonication and filtration. The Ag-NPs dispersed in medium were 43\u2013260\u00a0nm in size. We observed distinct uptake of Ag-NPs into BEAS-2B cells. The Ag-NPs aggregates were wrapped with an endocytic vesicle within the cytoplasm and nucleus of BEAS-2B cells. In the comet assay and micronucleus (MN) assay for BEAS-2B cells, Ag-NPs stimulated DNA breakage and MN formation in a dose-dependent manner. The genotoxic effect of Ag-NPs was partially blocked by scavengers. In particular, of the scavengers tested, superoxide dismutase most significantly blocked the genotoxic effects in both the cytokinesis-block MN assay and the comet assay. In the modified comet assay, Ag-NPs induced a significant increase in oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, in the oxidative stress assay, Ag-NPs significantly increased the reactive oxygen radicals. These results suggest that Ag-NPs have genotoxic effects in BEAS-2B cells and that oxidative stress stimulated by Ag-NPs may be an important factor in their genotoxic effects.",

     "abstract": "Nowadays, there is clear progress in using the threshold concept in genetic toxicology, but its demonstration and acceptance in risk assessment is still under debate. Although it has been accepted for some non-DNA-reactive agents for which mechanisms of action were demonstrated, there is a growing weight of evidence to also support the existence of thresholded dose-responses for DNA-reactive agents. In this context, we have recently shown in human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells, that DNA-oxidizing agents [potassium bromate, bleomycin and hydrogen peroxide (via glucose oxidase)] produced non-linear dose-responses in the in vitro micronucleus test, thus allowing the determination of No-Observed-Genotoxic-Effect-Levels (NOGELs). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to focus on the analysis of thresholded dose\u2013response curves in order to further investigate the existence of NOGELs for these same directly DNA-damaging agents, by use of other genotoxicity endpoints. Mutation frequency was determined after a 1-h treatment in the thymidine kinase (TK) gene-mutation assay. Primary DNA damage, especially oxidative DNA damage, was also assessed after 1\u00a0h of treatment, followed \u2013 or not \u2013 by a 23-h recovery period, with the modified version of the comet assay (i.e. with the glycosylases Fpg and hOgg1). Overall, our analysis demonstrates that there is convincing evidence to support the existence of thresholded dose-responses for DNA-oxidizing agents. The determination of NOGELs depends on the genotoxic endpoint studied and consequently requires different genotoxicity assays performed concurrently. NOGELs could only be defined for the induction of chromosomal aberrations and gene mutations, i.e. for an effect-endpoint but not for primary DNA damage, i.e. for an exposure-endpoint. Further statistical analyses of these data are now required in order to draw conclusions on the exact level of the thresholds.",

Besides its capability to form three deoxyguanosine adducts in DNA, N-(2-methoxyphenyl)-hydroxylamine is also further metabolized by hepatic microsomal enzymes. To investigate its metabolism by human hepatic microsomes and to identify the major microsomal enzymes involved in this process are the aims of this study. N-(2-Methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine is metabolized by human hepatic microsomes predominantly to o-anisidine, one of the parent carcinogens from which N-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine is formed, while o-aminophenol and two N-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine metabolites, whose exact structures have not been identified as yet, are minor products. Selective inhibitors of microsomal CYPs, NADPH:CYP reductase and NADH:cytochrome-b5 reductase were used to characterize human liver microsomal enzymes reducing N-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine to o-anisidine. Based on these studies, we attribute the main activity for this metabolic step in human liver to CYP3A4, 2E1 and 2C (more than 90%). The enzymes CYP2D6 and 2A6 also partake in this N-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine metabolism in human liver, but only to \u223c6%. Among the human recombinant CYP enzymes tested in this study, human CYP2E1, followed by CYP3A4, 1A2, 2B6 and 2D6, were the most efficient enzymes metabolizing N-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine to o-anisidine. The results found in this study indicate that genotoxicity of N-(2-methoxyphenyl)hydroxylamine is dictated by its spontaneous decomposition to nitrenium/carbenium ions generating DNA adducts, and by its susceptibility to metabolism by CYP enzymes.",

The results of the Ames test showed that EDDN increased the mean number of revertants per plate with strain TA100, without activation, at 5000\u00a0\u03bcg/plate compared to the solvent control, which indicated a positive result. No positive results were observed with the other tester strains with or without activation in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA98, TA1535, TA1537, and Escherichia coli strain WP2 uvrA. DETN was negative for all Salmonella tester strains and E. coli up to 5000\u00a0\u03bcg/plate both with and without metabolic activation. The CHO cell chromosome aberration assay was performed using EDDN and DETN at concentrations up to 5000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. The results indicate that these compounds did not induce structural chromosomal aberrations at all tested concentrations in CHO cells, with or without metabolic activation. EDDN and DETN, when tested in vivo in the CD-1 mouse at doses up to 2000\u00a0mg/kg, did not induce any significant increase in the number of micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes. These studies demonstrate that EDDN is mutagenic in one strain of Salmonella (TA100) but was negative in other strains, for in vitro induction of chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells, and for micronuclei in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. DETN was not genotoxic in all in vitro and in vivo tests. These results show the in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity potential of these chemicals.",

Patients treated with bimolane have been reported to have an increased risk of developing therapy-related leukemias. Although bimolane has been identified as a human leukemia-inducing agent, little is known about its genotoxic effects, and a systematic study of the types of chromosomal alterations induced by this compound has not been performed. In this study, a combination of immunochemical, molecular and conventional cytogenetic techniques has been used to study the chromosomal alterations induced by bimolane in cultured human lymphocytes. Immunochemical staining with the CREST antibody indicated that bimolane induces micronuclei (MN) originating primarily from chromosome breakage. Interestingly fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with differentially labeled chromosomes 1 and 9 centromeric probes indicated that bimolane also caused non-disjunction and polyploidy. Consistent with this, an expedited analysis of Giemsa-stained metaphase chromosomes in bimolane-treated lymphocytes revealed a high frequency of polyploidy/hyperdiploidy as well as dicentric chromosomes, and premature centromeric division (PCD). In addition, bimolane was also found to produce binucleated cells, possibly through an interference with normal functioning of intermediate filaments. As a follow-up to these studies, three different types of commercially available bimolane formulations obtained from different Chinese manufacturers were also evaluated. The effects seen with the formulated bimolane were similar to those seen with the synthesized compound. Our studies indicate that bimolane effectively induces a variety of cellular and chromosomal changes in cultured lymphocytes and that similar alterations occurring in bone marrow stem cells could contribute to the development of the secondary cancers seen in bimolane-treated patients.",

In this study, we examined the radioprotective activity of the total triterpenes isolated from Ganoderma lucidum (Fr.) P. Karst in mouse splenic lymphocytes in vitro. Using the MTT assay, Ganoderma triterpenes were found to have no effect on cell viability, indicating that they are non-toxic to splenic lymphocytes. The effect of the total triterpenes on DNA damage and apoptosis induced by radiation was analyzed using the comet assay, DNA ladder assay and flow cytometric analysis. Total triterpenes were found to be highly effective in preventing DNA laddering, even at low concentrations (25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). The comet assay demonstrated that the G. triterpenes effectively prevented DNA damage, and flow cytometry revealed a reduction in apoptotic cells. The effect of the total triterpenes on intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity in splenic lymphocytes were determined to elucidate possible radioprotective mechanisms. Total triterpenes successfully reduced the formation of intracellular ROS and enhanced endogenous antioxidant enzyme activity in splenic lymphocytes following irradiation. Thus, these findings indicate that the total triterpenes isolated from G. lucidum have a remarkable ability to protect normal cells from radiation-induced damage, which suggests therapeutic potential.",

It has been reported that metals can be genotoxic by several modes of action including generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of DNA repair. The aim of this study was to evaluate microsatellite instability (MSI) in three microsatellite loci (D6mit3, D9mit2 and D15Mgh1) located within three common fragile sites in the genome of the laboratory rat (6q21, 9q32\u20139q33 and 15p14) exposed to acute and chronic doses of a metal salt (lead acetate trihydrate) and a metalloid oxide (arsenic trioxide). In the acute and sub-chronic studies with the two compounds, MSI was observed in the three loci as deletions or additions of microsatellite repeats. The percentages of MSI were 36.4% and 42.1% for lead acetate and arsenic trioxide, respectively. Results of the present work indicate that the microsatellites located within fragile sites provide a convenient assay system to detect changes in DNA sequences resulting from exposure to genotoxic agents.",

     "abstract": "Several clinical studies have reported that an increase in excretion of tryptophan metabolites 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-OHAA), anthranilic acid (AA) and other metabolites in the urine of bladder cancer patients are implicated to play a role in the etiology of bladder cancer; however the mechanisms involved are unknown. The present study compares the genotoxicity of tryptophan metabolites AA and 3-OHAA to cause mutagenesis in vitro. The DNA damage effects of tryptophan metabolites were analyzed using plasmid relaxation assay performed with AA and 3-OHAA at various concentrations between 50\u00a0\u03bcM and 400\u00a0\u03bcM in the presence of plasmid DNA pSP-72. Both AA and 3-OHAA did not show any plasmid relaxation activity when tested alone. However, 3-OHAA in the presence of metal cofactor Cu (II) induced plasmid relaxation by causing nicks in the plasmid. This effect was not observed in the presence of other metal cofactors Fe (II) and Mn (III). Cu (II) at increasing concentrations between 5\u00a0\u03bcM and 20\u00a0\u03bcM and in the presence of 100\u00a0\u03bcM 3-OHAA showed an apparent dose\u2013response in causing DNA strand breaks. The Cu (II) mediated mutagenic activation of 3-OHAA was further investigated using Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay with reactive oxygen species (ROS) sensitive tester strain Salmonella TA102. When 100\u00a0\u03bcg of 3-OHAA per plate was incubated with Cu (II) a significant increase in TA102 revertants was observed with an increase in the concentration of Cu (II) from 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg to 50\u00a0\u03bcg. In contrast, AA with Cu (II) at such low concentration was unable to cause any significant increase in number of the TA102 revertants. This evidence for mutagenicity with only 3-OHAA and Cu (II) but not AA suggests the presence of hydroxyl group at ortho position to amino group in 3-OHAA structurally, is critical in reacting with Cu (II) to generate genotoxicity.",

Treatments were acute (60\u00a0min) and were administered via inhalation. IPA had low toxicity in adult flies (75% IPA mortality index, MI\u00a0=\u00a012.7% (females) and 2.6% (males)) and larvae (MI\u00a0=\u00a014.3%, 75% IPA). Female fertility was severely affected during the first 24\u00a0h (brood I, BI) after treatment, but, afterwards, control values were recovered. IPA induced a 50-fold increase of ND (%) in 24\u00a0h old females, and a six-fold rise in 4\u20135 d old BI offspring. Nondisjunction frequencies (%) in the offspring of broods II to V (24\u00a0h in each case) were similar to control values. IPA doses of 25% and 50% (v/v), tested in 24\u00a0h old females, showed a significant dose-dependent increase of ND(%)in BI only, with control values in subsequent broods. Flies gave normal offspring when kept in regular media for 24\u00a0h before mating. The eye spot test (SMART) showed a significant increase at 50% IPA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, m\u00a0=\u00a02), but the response was not dose-dependent. IPA failed to induce SLRL in any of the spermatogenesis stages tested. These findings suggest that the main effect of IPA is to induce chromosomal malsegregation; IPA must be present at the resumption of M-phase I after fertilization, to exert these effects. The alcohol does not affect DNA directly, but perturbations of the nuclear membrane may be responsible for induction of ND.",

The goal of this study was to validate the ability of this modified assay to detect oxidative stress-induced genotoxicity in Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R+). In this study, we used three well known chemical oxidative stress inducers: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), cadmium chloride (CdCl2) and copper sulfate (CuSO4). Third instar larvae of D. melanogaster were fed various concentrations of the test chemicals (50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcM) mixed with a standard Drosophila food for 24\u00a0h. Alkaline Comet assays with and without the FPG and ENDOIII enzymes were performed with midgut cells that were isolated from the control and treated larvae. Our results show a concentration-dependent increase (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05\u20130.001) in the migration of DNA from the treated larvae. ENDOIII treatment detected more oxidative DNA damage (specifically pyrimidine damage) in the H2O2 exposed larvae compared to FPG or no enzyme treatment (buffer only). In contrast, FPG treatment detected more oxidative DNA damage (specifically purine damage) in CuSO4 exposed larvae compared to ENDOIII. Although previously reported to be a potent genotoxic agent, CdCl2 did not induce more oxidative DNA damage than the other test chemicals. Our results show that the modified alkaline Comet assay can be used to detect oxidative stress-induced DNA damage in D. melanogaster and thus may be applicable for in vivo genotoxic assessments of environmental chemicals.",

Herein, we used the comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) to investigate the genotoxic effects of two volatile compounds [isoflurane (ISF) and sevoflurane (SVF)] that are used in inhalation anesthesia, and of one intravenous (iv) anesthetic compound [propofol (PF)]. The groups consisted of 45 patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery that lasted at least 2\u00a0h. Patients were classified as physical status I using the criteria of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and were randomly allocated to receive ISF, SVF or PF anesthesia. Venous blood samples were collected at three time points as follows: before the premedication and the induction of anesthesia (T0); 2\u00a0h after the beginning of anesthesia (T1); and on the day following surgery (T2). DNA damage (strand breaks and alkali-labile sites) was evaluated in peripheral blood lymphocytes. For each patient, one hundred nucleoids were analyzed per time point using a semi-automated image system. Patients did not differ with respect to their demographic characteristics, the duration of surgery, or the total doses of intraoperative drugs. The amount of DNA damage was not different among the three groups before anesthesia (T0). No statistically significant (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) increase in DNA damage was detected during (T1) or after anesthesia (T2) using three different protocols (ISF, SVF or PF). In conclusion, general anesthesia with inhaled ISF and SVF or iv PF did not induce DNA strand breaks or alkali-labile sites in peripheral lymphocytes.

     "abstract": "Titanium dioxide is manufactured worldwide in large quantities for use in a wide range of applications including as food additives, in cosmetics and pigments for coloring ingested and externally applied drugs. Although TiO2 is chemically inert it can cause negative health effects, such as lung cancer in rats. However, the mechanisms involved in TiO2-induced genotoxicity and carcinogenicity have not been clearly defined and are poorly studied in vivo. In the present research genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of titanium dioxide were studied in a mouse model. We treated CBAB6F1 mice by oral gavage with titanium dioxide particles (microsized, TDM, 160\u00a0nm; nanosized, TDN, 33\u00a0nm) in doses of 40, 200 and 1000\u00a0mg/kg bw, daily for seven days. Genotoxic effects were analyzed in the cells of brain, liver and bone marrow by means of the Comet assay and in the cells of bone marrow, forestomach, colon and testis with a poly-organ karyological assay (analysis of micronuclei, nuclear protrusions, atypical nuclei, multinucleated cells, mitotic and/or apoptotic index). TDM induced DNA-damage and micronuclei in bone-marrow cells and TDN induced DNA-damage in the cells of bone marrow and liver. TDM and TDN increased the mitotic index in forestomach and colon epithelia, the frequency of spermatids with two and more nuclei, and apoptosis in forestomach (only TDN) and testis. This is one of the first poly-organ studies of TDM- and TDN-induced genotoxicity in vivo in mice. These effects are caused by a secondary genotoxic mechanism associated with inflammation and/or oxidative stress. Given the increasing use of TiO2 nanoparticles, these findings indicate a potential health hazard associated with exposure to TiO2 particles.",

Both test-water samples \u2013 when used undiluted \u2013 increased the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities and/or micronuclei and alterations in the mitotic index of root cells of Allium cepa.

The plasmid-nicking assay performed on SWW resulted in linearization of plasmid DNA when 18\u00a0\u03bcl was tested (in a total reaction volume of 20\u00a0\u03bcl). However, with the same amount of AWW, all three forms of plasmid, viz. supercoiled, open circular and linear were observed. Supplementation with specific scavengers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused a significant decline in mutagenicity of test-water samples in all the tests, pointing at oxidative stress as the mediator of the observed genotoxicity. The role of heavy metals in the AWW-induced oxidative stress and that of phenolics in SWW cannot be ruled out.",

This study was conducted to examine the involvement of the p53 function in the different sensitivities between Chinese hamster lung (CHL) cells and human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells in MN assays. MN induction and cytotoxicity were compared using MN-inducing chemicals reported as DNA reactive clastogens, non-DNA reactive clastogens or aneugens. The study revealed that the maximum levels of MN induction in p53-compromised CHL cells were higher than those in p53-competent TK6 cells, but MN were significantly induced in TK6 cells at lower concentrations than in CHL cells. Most of the test chemicals produced a more severe cytotoxicity in TK6 cells, suggesting TK6 cells are more sensitive for cytotoxicity than CHL cells. An additional experiment with 9 MN inducers revealed that the magnitude of MN induction and cytotoxicity were comparable between p53-competent TK6 cells and its p53-null mutant NH32 cells at the same concentrations. Furthermore, the MN frequencies induced by methylmethane sulfonate, aphidicolin and hydroxyurea in NH32 cells were identical to those in TK6 cells at different recovery times. From these results, it is suggested that the p53 abrogation does not explain the difference in sensitivity to MN induction or cytotoxicity between CHL and TK6 cells. In this regard, p53 abrogated NH32 cells can be an option for the in vitro MN assay.",

Following exposure to a range of test agents, flat, single-cell preparations were produced from exponentially growing cultures by cytocentrifugation. Following staining with 4\u2032-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), cells were scanned by use of the MicroNuc module of Metafer 4 v 3.4.102, after modifying the classifier developed for selecting micronuclei in binucleate cells to increase its sensitivity. The image gallery of all cells was then sorted to bring aberrant cells to the top of the gallery to assess visually the numbers of cells with micronuclei, as distinct from other debris. Slide quality was shown to be paramount in obtaining accurate results from an automated scan and the data obtained compared very well with the incidence of micronuclei scored conventionally by microscopy. Compared with manual scoring the time saving is considerable, as more than 2000 images are captured in approximately 2\u00a0min, with subsequent visual assessment of aberrant cells in the image gallery taking about 1\u20132\u00a0min/slide.

It contaminates different components of the food chain and can cause serious economic and public health problems. The major metabolites of ZEN in various animal species are alpha- and beta-zearalenol (\u03b1-, \u03b2-ZOL). Some in vivo studies have shown that these two metabolites are as toxic as the mother molecule (ZEN), but other investigations have demonstrated that \u03b1- and \u03b2-ZOL are less toxic than ZEN. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of \u03b1- and \u03b2-ZOL in vivo, in mouse bone-marrow cells and in vitro, in cultured HeLa cells, and to compare it with ZEN. ZEN showed the same cytotoxicity as \u03b1-ZOL and both are more cytotoxic than \u03b2-ZOL. Genotoxicity of ZEN and its derivatives was assessed by the chromosome aberration assay. Our results show that ZEN as well as \u03b1- and \u03b2-ZOL increased the percentage of chromosome aberrations in mouse bone-marrow cells and in HeLa cells. In the two systems, ZEN and \u03b1-ZOL exhibited the same range of genotoxicity and both were more genotoxic than \u03b2-ZOL. Furthermore, our results show that either ZEN or its two metabolites inhibited cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. We conclude that biotransformation of ZEN may be considered as only a partial detoxification pathway since the resulting metabolites remain relatively toxic.",

PM2.5 and PM10 samplings, and measurements of NOx and some PAHs were performed daily in 2007 in Turin, following a consolidated in vitro test \u2013 the Salmonella mutagenicity assay \u2013 conducted with organic extracts of PM2.5 and PM10. The mutagenic properties were assessed for each month of sampling with Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 and TA98-derived strains: a nitroreductase-deficient mutant strain (TA98NR) and an additional nitroreductase-producing plasmid strain (YG1021). The annual measured mean levels of PM2.5 and PM10 were 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020 and 48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0\u03bcg/m3. The PM2.5/PM10 ratio ranged from 0.36 to 0.89.

However, these changes were reversed in the process of apoptosis. In addition, after BaP treatment, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Bax were activated during apoptosis and no change in p73 protein level was observed.

Organic pollutants were also extracted with two solvents for subsequent evaluation of their genotoxicity: a hexane/dichloromethane mixture intended to select non-polar compounds such as PAHs, and 2-propanol intended to select polar contaminants.

However, creating the in vivo data necessary to allow for a more detailed dose\u2013response modeling with the currently available tools might not always be practical. The purpose of the current work was to evaluate the utility of the Pig-a gene mutation assay to rapidly identify dose\u2013response relationships for direct acting genotoxicants. The induction of mutations in the peripheral blood of rats was evaluated following 28 days of exposure down to low doses of the direct acting alkylating agents ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) and ethylnitrosourea (ENU). Using statistical modeling based on the 28-day studies, a threshold for mutation induction for EMS was estimated to be 21.9\u00a0mg/kg, whereas for the more potent ENU, the threshold was estimated to be 0.88\u00a0mg/kg. Comparing mutation frequencies from acute and sub-chronic dosing indicated less than additive dose\u2013response relationships, further confirming the possibility of a threshold dose\u2013response relationship for both compounds. In conclusion, the work presented provides evidence that the Pig-a assay might be a practical alternative to other in vivo mutation assays when assessing dose\u2013response relationships for direct acting mutagens and that an experimental approach using fractionated dosing could be used to substantiate a biological mechanism responsible for the observation of a sublinear dose\u2013response relationship.",

     "abstract": "One consequence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an elevated risk for cancer. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is an increased incidence of at least some cancers in kidney-dialysis patients. Cancer risk after kidney transplantation has mainly been attributed to immunosuppressive therapy. There are no data evaluating DNA damage in children with CKD, in dialysis patients, or following kidney transplantation. In this study, the comet assay and the enzyme-modified comet assay \u2013 with the use of endonuclease III (Endo III) and formamidopyrimidine glycosylase (FPG) enzymes \u2013 were conducted to investigate the basal damage and the oxidative DNA damage as a result of treatment in peripheral blood lymphocytes of children. Children at various stages of treatment for kidney disease, including pre-dialysis patients (PreD) (n\u00a0=\u00a017), regular hemodialysis patients (HD) (n\u00a0=\u00a015), and those that received kidney transplants (Tx) (n\u00a0=\u00a017), comprised the study group. They were compared with age- and gender-matched healthy children (n\u00a0=\u00a020) as a control group. Our results show that the %DNA intensity, a measure of basal damage, was significantly increased in children with CKD (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) (5.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.57) and also in each of the PreD, HD, and Tx groups [(4.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.23), (4.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.35), and (5.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.94), respectively, vs the healthy children (2.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.91) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Significant increases in oxidative DNA damage were only found in the FPG-sensitive sites for the PreD and Tx groups, compared with control and HD groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), suggesting that basal DNA damage was more evident for the PreD, HD, and Tx groups. The findings of the present study indicate a critical need for further research on genomic damage with different endpoints and also for preventive measures and improvements in treatment of pediatric patients, in order to improve their life expectancy.",

Individual genetic variation in these metabolizing enzymes may influence the metabolism of their substrates. The present study was designed to determine the genotoxic effects using DNA damage and its association with GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1 (Ile105Val) genetic polymorphisms in workers occupationally exposed to organophosphate pesticides (OPs). We examined 230 subjects including 115 workers occupationally exposed to OPs and an equal number of normal healthy controls. The DNA damage was evaluated using the alkaline comet assay and genotyping was done using individual PCR or PCR\u2013RFLP. Significantly higher DNA tail moment (TM) was observed in workers as compared to control subjects (14.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.25 vs. 6.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.41 tail % DNA, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

A significantly higher DNA TM was also observed in workers with homozygous Ile\u2013Ile GSTP1 genotype than heterozygous (Ile\u2013Val) and mutant (Val\u2013Val) GSTP1 genotype (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

In the current study, the mechanism of genotoxicity of MX in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells was investigated by use of the Comet assay, the micronucleus test, and the thymidine kinase (TK) gene-mutation assay. MX induced a concentration-dependent increase in micronuclei and TK mutations. The lowest effective concentrations in the MN test and the TK gene-mutation assay were 37.5\u00a0\u03bcM and 25\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively. In the Comet assay, a slight although not statistically significant increase was observed in the level of DNA damage induced by MX in the concentration range of 25\u201362.5\u00a0\u03bcM. Molecular analysis of the TK mutants revealed that MX induced primarily point mutations or other small intragenic mutations (61%), while most of the remaining TK mutants (32%) were large deletions at the TK locus, leading to the hemizygous-type loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) mutations. These findings show that aside from inducing point mutations, MX also generates LOH at the TK locus in human cells and may thus cause the inactivation of tumour-suppressor genes by LOH.",

CLb (0.2 and 0.5\u00a0mg/kg b.w.) was administrated by gavage every day for 13 days. On the 14th day of the experiment, 6\u00a0mg/kg cDDP or saline was delivered intraperitoneally. Treatment with cDDP led to a significant decrease in DNA migration and an increase in MN frequency in both cell types, bone marrow and peripheral blood cells. In the kidneys of mice treated with cDDP, TBARS levels were increased, whereas GSH levels were depleted in kidney and liver. In mice that were pre-treated with CLb and then treated with cDDP, TBARS levels maintained normal concentrations and GSH did not differ from cDDP group. The improvement of oxidative stress biomarkers after CLb pre-treatment was associated with a decrease in DNA damage, mainly for the highest dose evaluated. Furthermore, CLb also slightly reduced the frequency of chromosomal breakage and micronucleus formation in mouse bone marrow and peripheral blood cells. These results show that pre-treatment with CLb attenuates cDDP-induced oxidative stress, chromosome instability, and lipid peroxidation.",

Bhas 42 cells were established from BALB/c 3T3 cells by the transfection of v-Ha-ras gene and postulated to have acquired an initiated state in the two-stage carcinogenesis theory. The Bhas 42 cell transformation assay is capable of detecting both tumor-initiating and tumor-promoting activities of chemical carcinogens. The full assay protocol consists of two components, the initiation assay and the promotion assay, to detect the initiating activity and the promoting activity, respectively. An international study was carried out to validate this cell transformation assay in which six laboratories from three countries participated. Twelve coded chemicals were examined in total and each chemical was tested by three laboratories. In the initiation assay, concordant results were obtained by three laboratories for eight out of ten chemicals and in the promotion assay, concordant results were achieved for ten of twelve chemicals. The positive results were obtained in all three laboratories with the following chemicals: 2-acetylaminofluorene was positive in both initiation and promotion assays; dibenz[a,h]anthracene was positive in the initiation assay; sodium arsenite, lithocholic acid, cadmium chloride, mezerein and methapyrilene hydrochloride were positive in the promotion assay. o-Toluidin hydrochloride was positive in the both assays in two of the three laboratories. d-Mannitol, caffeine and l-ascorbic acid were negative in both assays in all the laboratories, and anthracene was negative in both assays in two of the three laboratories except one laboratory obtaining positive result in the promotion assay. Consequently, the Bhas 42 cell transformation assay correctly discriminated all six carcinogens and two tumor promoters from four non-carcinogens. Thus, the present study demonstrated that the Bhas 42 cell transformation assay is transferable and reproducible between laboratories and applicable to the prediction of chemical carcinogenicity. In addition, by comparison of the present results with intra-laboratory data previously published, within-laboratory reproducibility using the Bhas 42 cell transformation assay was also confirmed.",

     "abstract": "Malathion is a well known pesticide and is commonly used in many agricultural and non-agricultural settings. Its toxicity has been attributed primarily to the accumulation of acetylcholine (Ach) at nerve junctions, due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and consequently overstimulation of the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. However, the genotoxicity of malathion has not been adequately studied; published studies suggest a weak interaction with the genetic material. In the present study, we investigated the genotoxic potential of malathion in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood obtained from Sprague-Dawley rats using chromosomal aberrations (CAs), mitotic index (MI), and DNA damage as toxicological endpoints. Four groups of four male rats, each weighing approximately 60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0g, were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) once a day for five days with doses of 2.5, 5, 10, and 20\u00a0mg/kg body weight (BW) of malathion dissolved in 1% DMSO. The control group was made up of four animals injected with 1% DMSO. All the animals were sacrificed 24\u00a0h after the fifth day treatment. Chromosome preparations were obtained from bone marrow cells following standard protocols. DNA damage in peripheral blood leukocytes was determined using alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay). Malathion exposure significantly increased the number of structural chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and the percentages of DNA damage, and decreased the mitotic index (MI) in treated groups when compared with the control group. Our results demonstrate that malathion has a clastogenic/genotoxic potential as measured by the bone marrow CA and comet assay in Sprague-Dawley rats.",

A number of boronic acids have now been tested in this laboratory using Salmonella typhimurium strains TA1535, TA1537, TA98 and TA100 and Escherichia coli strain WP2uvrA(pKM101). Twelve of the 13 structures presented here were found to be mutagenic. All the compounds except one were active only in TA100 and/or WP2uvrA(pKM101), did not require S9 activation and produced relatively weak responses, i.e. no more than seven times the concurrent solvent-control values at >1000\u00a0\u03bcg/plate. The single exception was also weakly mutagenic for TA1537 in the presence of S9. Results with two compounds mutagenic for both TA100 and WP2uvrA(pKM101) showed no evidence of DNA-adduct formation detectable by 32P-postlabelling. It appears that boronic acids represent a novel class of bacterial mutagen that may not act by direct covalent binding to DNA.

     "abstract": "In the present study an automated image analysis assisted in vitro micronucleus assay was developed with the rodent cell line CHO-k1 and the human hepatoma cell line HepG2, which are both commonly used in regulatory genotoxicity assays. The HepG2 cell line was chosen because of the presence in these cells of a functionally active p53 protein, a functionally competent DNA-repair system, active enzymes for phase-I and -II metabolism, and an active Nrf2 electrophile responsive system. These properties may result in an assay with a high predictivity for in vivo genotoxicity.The assays with CHO-k1 and HepG2 cells were both evaluated by testing a set of compounds recommended by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), among which are in vivo genotoxins and non-genotoxins. The CHO-k1 cell line showed a high sensitivity (percentage of genotoxic compounds that gave a positive result: 80%; 16/20) and specificity (percentage of non-genotoxic compounds that came out negative: 88%; 37/42). Although the sensitivity of the HepG2 cell line was lower (60%; 12/20), the specificity was high (88%; 37/42). These results were confirmed by testing an additional series of 16 genotoxic compounds. For both the CHO-k1 and the HepG2 cell line it was possible to size-classify micronuclei, enabling distinguishing aneugens from clastogens.It is concluded that two high-throughput micronucleus assays were developed that can detect genotoxic potential and allow differentiation between clastogens and aneugens. The performance scores of the CHO-k1 and HepG2 cell lines for in vivo genotoxicity were high. Application of these assays in the early discovery phase of drug development may prove to be a useful strategy to assess genotoxic potential at an early stage.",

These substances are mainly administered by two different routes: by prolonged immersion or by mixing into the diet. In the case of intensive aquaculture, the chemicals that are most frequently applied by immersion are formaldehyde (FA) 37% and oxytetracycline (OTC). The first is highly effective against most protozoa, as well as some of the most common parasites such as monogenetic trematodes. OTC presents a large spectrum of antibacterial activities and is used to treat systemic bacterial infections that affect fish. Under therapeutic use, FA (37%) is applied prophylactically at 200\u00a0ml/m3, whereas OTC is used curatively at 40\u00a0g/m3. The goal of the present study is to assess genotoxic and cytotoxic effects associated with exposure of the European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) to FA37% and OTC under the same conditions as those applied in intensive aquaculture systems. To this end the micronucleus (MN) assay was applied in erythrocytes. Our results show that both tested chemicals present genotoxic and cytotoxic potential following a time-dependent pattern. Remarkably, the combined treatment induces a cumulative effect, which is particularly pronounced after 15 days of exposure. This suggests the critical hazards associated with exposure to FA and OTC when applied or released together.",

     "abstract": "Doxorubicin (Dox) is a widely used drug in oncology with a broad spectrum of interactions with various cellular components; therefore, it is likely to act through different mechanisms. In clinical practice there is inter-individual variability in cytotoxic drug response and in the occurrence of adverse reactions. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1) are thought to be involved in the detoxification of endogenous and exogenous genotoxicants. The aim of this work is the assessment of a possible influence of polymorphisms in GSTs on the levels of genetic damage induced in vitro by Dox in cultured human lymphocytes. For this purpose, whole blood cultures from individuals with different genotypes for GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 were exposed to Dox and the cytokinesis-blocked micronucleus (CBMN) assay was used as the endpoint for chromosomal damage in the lymphocytes. Genotyping of GSTM1 and GSTT1 was carried out by multiplex PCR and the GSTP1-Ile105Val polymorphism was determined by PCR/RFLP. The total number of micronuclei present in 1000 binucleated cells and the frequency of micronucleated binucleated lymphocytes in the different individuals were analyzed considering the GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1 genotypes. The results obtained suggest that GSTM1 and GSTT1 deletion polymorphisms do not modify significantly the genotoxic potential of Dox. However, the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism was associated with an increase of micronucleated binucleated cells induced by Dox. Lymphocytes from homozygous individuals for the variant form (Val/Val) presented a significant increase in micronucleated binucleated cells (approximately 1.5-fold; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) when compared with individuals with at least one wild-type allele. These results suggest a possible role for GSTP1 on the modulation of the genotoxicity induced by Dox, which may be considered in cancer therapy.",

In addition, the combined treatments with gamma-radiation and PbCl2 or Pb(NO3)2 did not show significant variations in the frequency of the three categories of mutant spots recorded, compared with the frequency induced by gamma-radiation alone. This seems to indicate that the lead compounds tested do not interact with the repair of the genetic damage induced by ionizing radiation.

The present study was focused on a comparative investigation of genomic integrity in WBS patients by use of cytogenetic methods and the alkaline comet assay. Lymphocytes of whole peripheral blood were cultured and metaphases were examined for frequency and spectrum of chromosome aberrations. A WBS-related microdeletion was detected by means of the FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization) technique. The blood samples from patients who were carriers of this microdeletion, were tested in the comet assay. For this purpose, freshly collected lymphocytes were exposed to hydrogen peroxide (100\u00a0\u03bcM, 1\u00a0min, 4\u00a0\u00b0C). The frequencies of endogenous and exogenous DNA damage, and the kinetics and efficiency of DNA repair were measured during three subsequent hours of incubation. Comparison of the two data sets in this group of patients demonstrated a slightly elevated average frequency of chromosome aberrations, significantly increased levels of endogenous and H2O2-induced DNA damage, and somewhat impaired DNA repair. The relationship between an abnormal DNA-damage response and the 7q11.23 hemizygous microdeletion was confirmed experimentally when comparing the comet assay data in FISH-positive and FISH-negative lymphocytes from WBS-suspected patients. Briefly, our results indicate the impact of chromosomal instability within this region on susceptibility towards DNA damage, which may contribute to pathogenesis of this disease. It was shown also that the comet assay, as well as an experimental design proposed here, seem to be useful tools for estimating genome integrity in WBS patients.",

Studies on the cytogenetic toxicology of animal venoms and their isolated proteins are still very scarce in the literature, which emphasizes the importance of the present work for the identification and characterization of potential therapeutic agents, as well as for the better understanding of the mechanisms of action of toxins on the human body.",

Among EDCs, bisphenol A (BPA) is suggested to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) which play an important role in pathologies of female diseases such as endometriosis. On the other hand, previous studies suggested that sprouts of wheat (Triticum aestivum) have antimutagenicity and antioxidant activity. We performed the 2 weeks intervention of wheat sprout juice (100\u00a0ml/day) to investigate its effects on BPA-exposure and -oxidative toxicity in young women (N\u00a0=\u00a014, age\u00a0=\u00a024.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0). Geometrical mean of urinary BPA levels was 1.81 (GSTD, 4.34)\u00a0\u03bcg/g creatinine. We observed that irregular meals significantly increased levels of urinary BPA approximate 3 times (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). In addition, we found BPA-induced oxidative stress is correlated with levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) or malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.18 or 0.03, respectively). We also observed a continuous reduction of urinary BPA during the wheat sprout intervention (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In summary, our data suggested potential detoxification of wheat sprouts on BPA-toxicity via antioxidative and interference of absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME)-mediated mechanisms in young women.",

Currently, the top concentration recommended when toxicity is not limiting is 10\u00a0mM or 5\u00a0mg/ml, whichever is lower. The discussion was whether to reduce the limit, and if so whether the 1\u00a0mM limit proposed for human pharmaceuticals was appropriate for testing other chemicals. The consensus was that there was reason to consider reducing the 10\u00a0mM limit, and many, but not all, attendees favored a reduction to 1\u00a0mM. Several proposals are described here for the concentration limit.The in vitro cytogenetics expert working group also discussed appropriate measures and level of cytotoxicity. Data were reviewed from a multi-laboratory trial of the in vitro micronucleus (MN) assay with multiple cell types and several types of toxicity measurements. The group agreed on a preference for toxicity measures that take cell proliferation after the beginning of treatment into account (relative increase in cell counts, relative population doubling, cytokinesis block proliferation index or replicative index), and that this applies both to in vitro MN assays and to in vitro chromosome aberration assays. Since relative cell counts (RCC) underestimate toxicity, many group members favored making a recommendation against the use of RCC as a toxicity measure for concentration selection.All 14 chemicals assayed for MN induction in the multi-laboratory trial were detected without exceeding 50% toxicity by any measure, but some were positive only at concentrations with toxicity quite close to 50%. The expert working group agreed to accept the cytotoxicity range recommended by OECD guideline 487 (55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% toxicity at the top concentration scored). This also reinforces the original intent of the guidance for the in vitro chromosome aberration assay, where \u201c>50%\u201d was intended to target the range close to 50% toxicity.",

     "abstract": "The optimal use of historical control data for the interpretation of genotoxicity results was discussed at the 2009 International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing (IWGT) in Basel, Switzerland. The historical control working group focused mainly on negative control data although positive control data were also considered to be important. Historical control data are typically used for comparison with the concurrent control data as part of the assay acceptance criteria. Historical control data are also important for providing evidence of the technical competence and familiarization of the assay at any given laboratory. Moreover, historical control data are increasingly being used to aid in the interpretation of genetic toxicity assay results.The objective of the working group was to provide generic advice for historical control data that could be applied to all assays rather than to give assay-specific recommendations. In brief, the recommendations include: 1. The experimental protocol should remain fixed throughout the period during which the historical control data relevant to the current experiment are being built up, unless it can be demonstrated that changes to the protocol have not affected the values. 2. All data (both individual and group mean values) should be accumulated. 3. No negative control values (i.e., vehicle/solvent controls and absolute/culture medium controls, when available) should be eliminated from the data set, even if considered unusual, unless there is a scientifically justified reason, such as when they were obtained by an identified technical error. However, experiments may need to be repeated if disqualified by historical control data. 4. A minimum set of data resulting from at least 10, preferably 20, independent experiments is recommended to create the historical data set, depending upon the complexity of the assay. 5. It is not appropriate to use the simple range (minimum and maximum value observed during the data accumulation period) of the accumulated historical, especially negative, control data for an assessment. Rather, the distribution of the data together with appropriate descriptive statistics should be considered (e.g., confidence intervals, 95\u201399% percentiles). 6. For an experiment, when statistically significant increases over the concurrent negative controls (i.e., vehicle/solvent controls) are comparable, i.e., within confidence intervals, with the negative historical data, the biological importance needs to be carefully considered. 7. Historical control data could potentially have an important role in the future to help interpret aspects of genotoxicity data, such as dose response relationships.",

An Expert Panel was convened from regulatory, academic and industrial scientists (with several members serving on the original panel) and chaired by Dr Peter Kasper (BfArM, Germany). The aim of the workshop was to review progress made in photo(geno)toxicity testing over the past decade; a period which saw the introduction of several regulatory photosafety guidances in particular in Europe and the USA. Based on current regulatory guidelines a substantial proportion of compounds trigger the requirements for photosafety testing. Moreover, there has been growing concern within industry about the performance of the in vitro photosafety tests in the \u201creal world\u201d of compound development. Therefore, the expert group reviewed the status of the current regulatory guidance's and the impact these have had on compound development in the context of the various triggers for photosafety testing. In addition, the performance of photogenotoxicity assays (old and new) was discussed, particularly in view of reports of pseudophotoclastogencity. The Expert Panel finished with an assessment of the positioning of photogenotoxicity testing within a photosafety testing strategy. The most significant conclusion made by the Expert Panel was that photogenotoxicity testing should no longer be recommended as part of the standard photosafety testing strategy. In addition, progress was made on the refinement of triggers for photosafety testing. For example, there was support for harmonisation of methods to determine the Molar Extinction Coefficient (MEC) and a consensus agreement that there should be no requirement for testing of compounds with a MEC\u00a0<\u00a01000\u00a0L\u00a0mol\u22121\u00a0cm\u22121.",

     "abstract": "Improving current in vitro genotoxicity tests is an ongoing task for genetic toxicologists. Further, the question on how to deal with positive in vitro results that are demonstrated to not predict genotoxicity or carcinogenicity potential in rodents or humans is a challenge. These two aspects were addressed at the 5th International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing (IWGT) held in Basel, Switzerland, on August 17\u201319, 2009. The objectives of the working group (WG) were to make recommendations on the use of cell types or lines, if possible, and to provide evaluations of promising new approaches. Results obtained in rodent cell lines with impaired p53 function (L5178Y, V79, CHL and CHO cells) and human p53-competent cells (peripheral blood lymphocytes, TK6 and HepG2 cells) suggest that a reduction in the percentage of non-relevant positive results for carcinogenicity prediction can be achieved by careful selection of cells used without decreasing the sensitivity of the assays. Therefore, the WG suggested using p53- competent \u2013 preferably human \u2013 cells in in vitro micronucleus or chromosomal aberration tests. The use of the hepatoma cell line HepaRG for genotoxicity testing was considered promising since these cells possess better phase I and II metabolizing potential compared to cell lines commonly used in this area and may overcome the need for the addition of S9. For dermally applied compounds, the WG agreed that in vitro reconstructed skin models, once validated, will be useful to follow up on positive results from standard in vitro assays as they resemble the properties of human skin (barrier function, metabolism). While the reconstructed skin micronucleus assay has been shown to be further advanced, there was also consensus that the Comet assay should be further evaluated due to its independence from cell proliferation and coverage of a wider spectrum of DNA damage.",

     "publication date": "08-2011",
     "abstract": "A working group convened at the 2009 5th IWGT to discuss possibilities for improving in vivo genotoxicity assessment by investigating possible links to standard toxicity testing. The working group considered: (1) combination of acute micronucleus (MN) and Comet assays into a single study, (2) integration of MN assays into repeated-dose toxicity (RDT) studies, (3) integration of Comet assays into RDT studies, and (4) requirements for the top dose when integrating genotoxicity measurements into RDT studies. The working group reviewed current requirements for in vivo genotoxicity testing of different chemical product classes and identified opportunities for combination and integration of genotoxicity endpoints for each class. The combination of the acute in vivo MN and Comet assays was considered by the working group to represent a technically feasible and scientifically acceptable alternative to conducting independent assays. Two combination protocols, consisting of either a 3- or a 4-treament protocol, were considered equally acceptable. As the integration of MN assays into RDT studies had already been discussed in detail in previous IWGT meetings, the working group focussed on factors that could affect the results of the integrated MN assay, such as the possible effects of repeated bleeding and the need for early harvests. The working group reached the consensus that repeated bleeding at reasonable volumes is not a critical confounding factor for the MN assay in rats older than 9 weeks of age and that rats bled for toxicokinetic investigations or for other routine toxicological purposes can be used for MN analysis. The working group considered the available data as insufficient to conclude that there is a need for an early sampling point for MN analysis in RDT studies, in addition to the routine determination at terminal sacrifice. Specific scenarios were identified where an additional early sampling can have advantages, e.g., for compounds that exert toxic effects on hematopoiesis, including some aneugens. For the integration of Comet assays into RDT studies, the working group reached the consensus that, based upon the limited amount of data available, integration is scientifically acceptable and that the liver Comet assay can complement the MN assay in blood or bone marrow in detecting in vivo genotoxins. Practical issues need to be considered when conducting an integrated Comet assay study. Freezing of tissue samples for later Comet assay analysis could alleviate logistical problems. However, the working group concluded that freezing of tissue samples can presently not be recommended for routine use, although it was noted that results from some laboratories look promising. Another discussion topic centred around the question as to whether tissue toxicity, which is more likely observed in RDT than in acute toxicity studies, would affect the results of the Comet assay. Based on the available data from in vivo studies, the working group concluded that there are no clear examples where cytotoxicity, by itself, generates increases or decreases in DNA migration. The working group identified the need for a refined guidance on the use and interpretation of cytotoxicity methods used in the Comet assay, as the different methods used generally lead to inconsistent conclusions. Since top doses in RDT studies often are limited by toxicity that occurs only after several doses, the working group discussed whether the sensitivity of integrated genotoxicity studies is reduced under these circumstances. For compounds for which in vitro genotoxicity studies yielded negative results, the working group reached the consensus that integration of in vivo genotoxicity endpoints (typically the MN assay) into RDT studies is generally acceptable. If in vitro genotoxicity results are unavailable or positive, consensus was reached that the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is acceptable as the top dose in RDT studies in many cases, such as when the RDT study MTD or exposure is close (50% or greater) to an acute study MTD or exposure. Finally, the group agreed that exceptions to this general rule might be acceptable, for example when human exposure is lower than the preclinical exposure by a large margin.",

Quantitative risk assessment in such cases requires the use of (1) adequate data, i.e., the use of all available data for the selection of reliable in vivo models to be used for quantitative risk assessment, (2) appropriate mathematical models and statistical analysis for characterizing the dose-response relationships and allowing the use of quantitative and dose-response information in the interpretation of results, (3) mode of action (MOA) information for the evaluation and analysis of risk, and (4) reliable assessments of the internal dose across species for deriving acceptable margins of exposure and risk levels. Hence, the elucidation of MOA and understanding of the mechanism underlying the dose-response curve are important components of risk assessment. The group agreed on the need for (i) the development of in vivo assays, especially multi-endpoint, multi-species assays, with emphasis on those applicable to humans, and (ii) consensus about the most appropriate mathematical models and statistical analyses for defining non-linear dose-responses and exposure levels associated with acceptable risk.",

     "abstract": "Traffic is a major source of particulate matter (PM), and ultrafine particulates and traffic intensity probably contribute significantly to PM-related health effects. As a strong relationship between air pollution and motor vehicle-originated pollutants has been shown to exist, air pollution genotoxicity studies of urban cities are steadily increasing. In Korea, the death rate caused by lung cancer is the most rapidly increased cancer death rate in the past 10 years. In this study, genotoxicity of PM2.5 (<2.5\u00a0\u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter particles) collected from the traffic area in Suwon City, Korea, was studied using cultured human lung bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) as a model system for the potential inhalation health effects. Organic extract of PM2.5 (CE) generated significant DNA breakage and micronucleus formation in a dose-dependent manner (1\u00a0\u03bcg/cm3\u201350\u00a0\u03bcg/cm3). In the acid\u2013base\u2013neutral fractionation of PM2.5, neutral samples including the aliphatic (F3), aromatic (F4) and slightly polar (F5) fractions generated significant DNA breakage and micronucleus formation. These genotoxic effects were significantly blocked by scavenging agents [superoxide dismutase (SOD), sodium selenite (SS), mannitol (M), catalase (CAT)]. In addition, in the modified Comet assay using endonucleases (FPG and ENDOIII), CE and its fractions (F3, F4, and F5) increased DNA breakage compared with control groups, indicating that CE and fractions of PM2.5 induced oxidative DNA damage. These results clearly suggest that PM2.5 collected in the Suwon traffic area has genotoxic effects and that reactive oxygen species may play a distinct role in these effects. In addition, aliphatic/chlorinated hydrocarbons, PAH/alkylderivatives, and nitro-PAH/ketones/quinones may be important causative agents of the genotoxic effects.",

     "abstract": "Over the last years, extensive research has documented endocrine-disrupting activities for a significant number of substances including, among others, hormones, pharmaceuticals, pesticides and surfactants. Nonetheless, for most endocrine disruptors, toxicological profiles are still incomplete or even lacking. A systematic review has shown that a number of endocrine disruptors with steroid-modulating effects may also exert mutagenic and carcinogenic activities. For trenbolone, an androgenic compound, there is controversy about its genotoxic properties in the literature, apparently with a strong dependence on the choice of the test system. Since fish and other aquatic animals are at risk of exposure to run-offs from cattle feedlots or sewage-discharge sites containing trenbolone, potential consequences to aquatic ecosystems need to be assessed. To this end, the potential genotoxic hazard of trenbolone was tested in vitro in the permanent rainbow trout-liver cell-line RTL-W1, as well as in primary cell cultures derived from zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos after in vivo exposure.

These materials are cured in situ and HEMA and other monomers have been identified in ambient air during dental surgery. In vitro studies have demonstrated a toxic potential of methacrylates, and concerns have been raised regarding possible health effects due to inhalation. In this study we have investigated the mechanisms of HEMA-induced toxicity in the human lung epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Depletion of cellular glutathione (GSH) and an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were seen after 2\u00a0h of exposure, but the levels were restored to control levels after 12\u00a0h. After 24\u00a0h, inhibited cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death were found. The results of the Comet assay and the observed phosphorylation of DNA-damage-associated signalling proteins including Chk2, H2AX, and p53 suggest that the toxicity of HEMA is mediated by DNA damage. Further, the antioxidant trolox did not counteract the HEMA-induced cell-cycle arrest, which indicates that the DNA damage is of non-oxidative origin.",

They contain large amounts of potentially useful phytochemicals and could play beneficial roles in health care. In the present study, the principal bioactive phenols in olive-leaf extracts (OLEs) have been identified and quantified, and their genotoxic/antigenotoxic, cytotoxic and apoptotic effects have been assessed.The Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in wing imaginal discs of Drosophila melanogaster has been performed to test the possible genotoxicity of overall OLE and the individual components oleuropein and luteolin at different concentrations. The same assay was able to detect antigenotoxic activity against hydrogen peroxide as oxidative genotoxicant. None of the extracts/phenols tested showed significant mutagenic activity. This fact, together with the antigenotoxic activity against H2O2 detected for all these extracts/phenols, confirmed the safety of OLE, oleuropein and luteolin in terms of DNA protection.HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells were used to assess the cytotoxic effects of the extracts/phenols. OLE, oleuropein and luteolin showed a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect with different IC50 (10\u00a0\u03bcl/ml, 170\u00a0\u03bcM, and 40\u00a0\u03bcM, respectively). DNA fragmentation patterns and cell staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide indicated that the mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of OLE, oleuropein and luteolin was the apoptotic pathway, with DNA laddering and cytoplasmic and nuclear changes.These results could help explain the mechanism of action that underlies the beneficial effect of OLE, proposed as a nutraceutical in the prevention of human cancer.",

A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of asbestos-induced malignant transformation will help to identify molecular markers that can be used for diagnosis, prognosis or therapeutic targets.The objectives of this study are (1) to identify altered levels of proteins and phosphoproteins and (2) to establish the interactive network among those proteins in crocidolite-treated benign mesothelial cells and in malignant mesothelial cells.Total cellular proteins were extracted from benign mesothelial cells, crocidolite-treated mesothelial cells and malignant mesothelial cells. The expression levels of 112 proteins and phosphoproteins were analyzed using a multiplex immunoblot-based assay followed by computational analysis (Protein Pathway Array).A total of 16 proteins/phosphoproteins (7 down-regulated and 9 up-regulated) were altered after exposure of benign mesothelial cells to crocidolite asbestos and the majority of them are involved in DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation. In malignant mesothelial cells, 21 proteins/phosphoproteins (5 down-regulated and 16 up-regulated) were dysregulated and majority of them are involved in EGFR/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways. Within the regulatory network affected by crocidolite, p53 and NF-\u03baB complex are the most important regulators. There was substantial overlap in the regulatory networks between the asbestos-treated cells and malignant mesothelial cells.Asbestos exposure has extensive effects on regulatory pathways and networks. These altered proteins may be used in the future to identify those with a high risk for developing malignant mesothelioma and as targets for preventing this deadly malignancy.",

The goal of this study was to evaluate whether L. chagasi infection causes DNA damage in peripheral blood and spleen cells of Balb/c mice and whether such damage may be related to NO production. Balb/c mice were either infected with L. chagasi or maintained as controls. The single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay was used to measure DNA damage in peripheral blood and spleen cells, and the Griess reaction was used to measure NO production in the spleen. L. chagasi infection induced DNA damage in peripheral blood and spleen cells of infected mice. Macrophages from the control group, challenged with L. chagasi, showed significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) greater NO production, compared to non-challenged cells. Treatment of spleen cells with NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (LNMMA) caused a significant reduction of NO production and DNA damage (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Contradictory results have been obtained on their genotoxicity. We investigated the genotoxicity and protein binding of inhaled TDI and MDI in mice by examining micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) in bone marrow and peripheral blood and TDI- and MDI-derived adducts in hemoglobin. Male C57Bl/6J mice (8 per group) were exposed head-only to TDI vapour (mean concentrations 1.1, 1.5, and 2.4\u00a0mg/m3; the mixture of isomers contained, on the average, 63% 2,4-TDI and 37% 2,6-TDI) or MDI aerosol (mean concentrations 10.7, 20.9 and 23.3\u00a0mg/m3), during 1\u00a0h/day for 5 consecutive days. Bone marrow and peripheral blood were collected 24\u00a0h after the last exposure. Inhalation of TDI caused sensory irritation (SI) in the upper respiratory tract, and cumulative effects were observed at the highest exposure level. Inhalation of MDI produced SI and airflow limitation, and influx of inflammatory cells into the lungs. Hemoglobin adducts detected in the exposed mice resulted from direct binding to globin of 2,4- and 2,6-TDI and MDI, and dose-dependent increases were observed especially for 2,4-TDI-derived adducts. Adducts originating from the diamines of TDI (toluene diamine) or MDI (methylene dianiline) were not observed. No significant increase in the frequency of micronucleated PCEs was detected in the bone marrow or peripheral blood of the mice exposed to TDI or MDI. The ratio of PCEs and normochromatic erythrocytes (NCEs) was reduced at the highest concentration of MDI, and a slight reduction of the PCE/NCE ratio, dependent on cumulative inhaled dose, was also seen with TDI. Our results indicate that inhalation of TDI or MDI (1\u00a0h/day for 5 days), at levels that induce toxic effects and formation of TDI- or MDI-specific adducts in hemoglobin, does not have detectable genotoxic effects in mice, as studied with the micronucleus assay.",

Blood samples were taken and the expression (mRNA level) of the GSH-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase gene (FDH, identical to alcohol dehydrogenase 5, ADH5; EC 1.2.1.46) was measured in leukocytes by quantitative real-time RT-PCR with TaqMan probes. FDH is the most important enzyme for the metabolic inactivation of FA. Blood samples were exposed to 150\u00a0\u03bcM formaldehyde (FA) for 2\u00a0h and the induction of DNA\u2013protein crosslinks (DPX) in leukocytes was measured by means of a modification of the alkaline comet assay (i.e., by assessing the reduction of DNA migration induced by \u03b3-radiation). Removal of DPX was determined by the abolition of FA-induced reduction in DNA migration within 4\u00a0h after the end of the exposure. Furthermore, the induction of sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in cultured lymphocytes was studied after treatment of whole blood cultures with FA (150\u00a0\u03bcM). A correlation analysis was performed for all parameters tested for the whole study group and for hypersensitive and hyposensitive subgroups. The results indicate that despite large differences in CO2-sensitivity, the susceptibility towards nasal irritation was not related to the induction of genotoxic effects (DPX, SCE) in peripheral blood or to the protection of blood cells against FA-induced effects (expression of FDH, repair capacity for FA-induced DPX). There was no correlation between CO2-sensitivity and the expression of FDH. There was also no close correlation between the various indicators of cellular sensitivity towards FA-induced genotoxic effects and no subgroups were identified with particular mutagen sensitivity towards FA.",

Cd (10\u00a0\u03bcg/L) is genotoxic only during the first 3 days of exposure in gill cells, while in haemocytes the genotoxicity of Cd was observed later.

Cd induced an increase of DNA damage in Fpg-treated slides, indicating that Cd contributed to oxidative DNA damage. Cadmium induced a cytogenetic effect in gill cells, assessed by the number of micronuclei, throughout the duration of the exposure, while B[a]P did not induce any cytogenetic effect.

The function of the Pig-a protein in the synthesis of glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchors is conserved in variety of eukaryotic cells, including human and rodent cells, which implies that Pig-a mutants can be measured in a similar manner in different mammalian species. In the present study, we developed a flow cytometric Pig-a assay for rapidly measuring gene mutation in the mouse. An antibody to TER-119, a specific cell-surface marker of murine erythroid lineage, was used to identify erythrocytes in peripheral blood (PB) and erythroids in bone marrow (BM). An antibody to CD24, a GPI-anchored protein, was used to identify Pig-a mutants as CD24-negative cells. CD-1 mice were administered a single dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU), and PB and BM were collected at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after dosing. While the Pig-a mutant frequency (MF) in PB was increased moderately at 2 and 4 weeks after ENU dosing, the Pig-a MF in BM was strongly increased starting at 1 week after the dosing, with the elevated MF persisting for at least 4 weeks after the dosing. We also used flow cytometric sorting to isolate CD24-negative erythroids from the BM of ENU-treated mice. cDNA sequencing indicated that these cells have mutations in the Pig-a gene, with base-pair substitutions typical of ENU-induced mutation spectra. The results indicate that the Pig-a mutation assay can be adapted for measuring mutation in BM erythroids and PB of mice. Taken together, the data suggest that Pig-a mutants are fixed in the BM, where they further proliferate and differentiate; erythrocytes derived from these BM Pig-a mutants transit from the BM and accumulate in PB.",

For the MN and cytotoxicity measurements, the cell lines were treated for 24\u00a0h (CHO cells) or 27\u00a0h (TK6 cells) with 5\u201325\u00a0\u03bcM OTA in the absence of exogenous metabolic activation. The OTA treatments resulted in concentration\u2013responsive increases in cytotoxicity, with higher concentrations of the agent being more cytotoxic in CHO cells than TK6 cells. 15\u00a0\u03bcM OTA produced positive responses for MN induction and hypodiploid events (a measure of aneugenicity) in both cell lines; this concentration of OTA also produced cytotoxicity near to the recommended limit for the assay (45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% RPD). A time course assay with TK6 cells indicated that at least 4\u00a0h of OTA treatment were required to produce a positive MN response. For the Comet assay DNA damage assessments, the cell lines were treated with 5\u201350\u00a0\u03bcM OTA for 4\u00a0h. Direct DNA damage was detected in TK6 cells, but not CHO cells, while concentration-related increases in fpg-sensitive sites were detected for both cell lines. The consistent association of oxidative DNA damage with OTA exposure suggests its involvement in producing OTA-induced clastogenicity and aneugenicity; however, based on its detection in TK6 cells direct DNA damage could be involved in any human risk posed by OTA exposure.",

Since the ingestion of aflatoxins-contaminated food is associated with several liver diseases, the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether AF-induced damage in rats can be counteracted by feeding with whey-protein concentrates (WPC) and Korean ginseng extract (KGE).Eighty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into eight equal groups and treated daily for 30 days as follows: a control group (fed an AF-free diet), a group fed ad libitum an AF-contaminated diet (2.5\u00a0mg/kg diet), a group treated orally with WPC (0.5\u00a0ml/rat/day), a group treated orally with KGE (20\u00a0mg/kg body weight), a group treated orally with WPC\u00a0+\u00a0KGE, and three groups that were fed the AF-contaminated diet and were treated orally with WPC, KGE or WPC\u00a0+\u00a0KGE, respectively. Throughout the experimental period, animals received WPC or KGE during the consumption of their respective diet. Bone-marrow micronucleus formation, DNA fragmentation, fatty-acid synthesis (FAS) and phospholipid-hydroperoxide-glutathione-peroxidase (PHGPx) mRNA expression, and oxidative stress were assayed in liver and testis. The results indicated that ingestion of aflatoxin resulted in a significant increase in micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (Mn-NCE) in bone marrow, DNA fragmentation, FAS mRNA expression and lipid peroxidation in both organs, and a significant decrease in micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes/micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes (PCE/NCE) ratio in bone marrow, PHGPx gene expression and GSH in liver and testis. Treatments with WPC and/or KGE had a significant effect on Mn-NCE or the PCE/NCE ratio in bone marrow. However, KGE or KGE\u00a0+\u00a0WPC increased PHGPx gene expression and GSH in testis accompanied with a significant decrease in lipid peroxidation in liver and testis and FAS-mRNA expression in liver. WPC, KGE or WPC\u00a0+\u00a0KGE treatments combined with exposure to an AF-contaminated diet restored all the test parameters towards control values, although they did not fully reverse the effects of the aflatoxins. It is suggested that the genotoxicity of aflatoxins can be in part prevented by dietary supplementation with WPC, KGE or their combination.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of events following initiation are less well understood, and with respect to genotoxic liver carcinogenesis, it is largely unknown how the initiated cells progress to form preneoplastic hepatic foci. In the present study, we investigated the underlying events associated with tumor-promoting activity of 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF), a powerful complete genotoxic rat liver carcinogen. Male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were fed NIH-31 diet containing 0.02% of 2-AAF for 24 weeks, and the status of cytosine DNA methylation, histone methylation, and microRNA expression was determined in the livers of control and 2-AAF-fed rats. The results demonstrate that stages of multistage carcinogenesis following the initiation are driven primarily by carcinogen-induced epigenetic alterations. This was evidenced by altered global histone lysine methylation patterns, increased histone H3 lysine 9 and histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation in the promoter regions of Rassf1a, p16INK4a, Socs1, Cdh1, and Cx26 tumor suppressor genes, early Rassf1a and p16INK4a promoter CpG island hypermethylation, and altered microRNA expression in preneoplastic livers of rats exposed to 2-AAF. These changes were accompanied by dysregulation of the balance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, a fundamental pro-tumorigenic event in hepatocarcinogenesis. These results signify the fundamental role of epigenetic alterations in genotoxic liver carcinogenesis.",

Therefore radiation treatment can cause numerous side effects in exposed tissues and organs. Radiotherapy is a part of the front-line treatment regime for brain cancer patients, but can cause severe functional and morphological changes in exposed brain tissues. However, the mechanisms of radiation-induced effects in the brain are not well understood and are under-investigated. Recent data has implicated short RNAs, especially microRNAs, as important in radiation responses, yet nothing is known about radiation-induced changes in the brain microRNAome.We analyzed the effects of X-ray irradiation on microRNA expression in the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum of male and female mice. Here, we report tissue-, time-, and sex-specific brain radiation responses, as well as show evidence of an interplay between microRNAs and their targets. Specifically, we show that changes in the expression of the miR-29 family may be linked, at least in part, to altered expression of de novo methyltransferase DNMT3a and changed global DNA methylation levels. Further, these sex-specific epigenetic changes may be correlated to the prevalence of radiation-induced cancers in males.We identified several microRNAs that can potentially serve as biomarkers of brain radiation exposure. In summary, our study may provide an important roadmap for further analysis of microRNA expression in different brain regions of male and female mice and for detailed dissection of radiation-induced brain responses.",

     "abstract": "Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is a mutagenic and carcinogenic environmental contaminant. Metabolic activation of BaP is required for it to exert its mutagenic effects. Metabolism occurs via BaP interaction with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) resulting in induction of phase 1 enzymes. Exposure to BaP is expected to cause differential regulation of AHR-responsive genes as well as pathways responding to DNA damage induced by its metabolites. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding molecules that control mRNA levels and protein translation. MiRNA regulation may also be affected by chemical insult. Here we investigate the correlation between hepatic mRNA and miRNA response to BaP in vivo. Mature male mice were orally exposed to 3 daily doses of 150\u00a0mg/kg BaP. DNA microarrays were used to profile gene and miRNA expression in the liver 4 and 24\u00a0h following the final dose. Despite widespread changes in gene expression (>400 genes) in pathways consistent with the known effects of BaP, we found no changes in miRNA. This was confirmed on two microarray platforms and by qRT-PCR. Analysis of positive controls (2 distinct reference pools) indicated that the Agilent technology could identify differences in miRNA. The effects of sample storage at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C were also compared. We found little effect of prolonged freezing on the technical correlation between samples or on differential expression. Our results are consistent with the lack of response of miRNA in rodent liver to dioxin, another potent AHR-agonist.

A major corrective pathway for alkylation or oxidative DNA damage is base excision repair (BER). As part of an effort to identify variation in DNA repair genes, we used the expressed sequence tag (EST) database to identify amino acid variation in Ape1, an essential gene in the BER repair pathway. Nucleotide substitutions were considered valid only if the amino acid changes were observed in at least two independent EST sequencing runs (i.e. two independent EST reports). In total eighty amino acid variants were identified for the Ape1 gene. Using software tools SIFT and PolyPhen, which predict impacts of amino acid substitutions on protein structure and function, twenty-six variants were predicted by both algorithms to be deleterious to protein function. Majority of these intolerant mutations such as V206C and F240S, lie within the core of the protein and may affect the stability and folding of Ape1, or in the case of N212H, N212K, and Y171N, are close to the enzyme's active site and could drastically affect its function. A few of the intolerant mutations, i.e., G178V and E217R, are surface residues and are far from the active site, and as such, the predicted effect on Ape1 stability or function is not evident.

High stathmin levels have been associated with the development of resistance to the widely used anti-cancer drug taxol (\u00aeTaxol, paclitaxel). The mechanisms of stathmin-mediated taxol resistance are not well-understood at the molecular level. To better understand the role of stathmin in taxol resistance, we stably overexpressed stathmin twofold in BT549 human breast cancer cells and characterized several cell processes involved in the mechanism of action of taxol. After stable overexpression of stathmin, neither the cell doubling time nor the mitotic index was altered and the microtubule polymer mass was reduced only modestly (by 18%). Unexpectedly, microtubule dynamicity was reduced by 29% after stathmin overexpression, resulting primarily from reduction in the catastrophe frequency. Sensitivity to taxol was reduced significantly (by 44%) in a clonogenic assay, and stathmin appeared to protect the cells from the spindle-damaging effects of taxol. The results suggest that in the stably stathmin-overexpressing clones, compensatory gene expression occurred that resulted in normal rates of cell proliferation and prevented the increase in catastrophe frequency expected in response to stathmin. Stathmin overexpression protected the cells from taxol-induced abnormal mitoses, and thus induced taxol resistance. Using offgel IEF/PAGE difference gel electrophoresis, we identified a number of proteins whose expression is reduced in the taxol-resistant stathmin-overexpressing cell lines, including proteins involved in the cytoskeleton and cell structure, the stress response, protein folding, glycolysis, and catalysis.",

Structural genomics is an overloaded term and requires some definition to bound the discussion; we give a brief description of public and private structural genomics endeavors, along with some of their objectives, their activities, their capabilities, and their limitations. We discuss how structural genomics might impact mutagen research in three different scenarios: at a structural genomics center, at a lab with modest resources that also conducts structural biology research, and at a lab that is conducting mutagen research without in-house experimental structural biology. Applications span functional annotation of single genes or SNP, to constructing gene networks and pathways, to an integrated systems biology approach. Structural genomics centers can take advantage of systems biology models to target high value targets for structure determination and in turn extend systems models to better understand systems biology diseases or phenomenon. Individual investigator run structural biology laboratories can collaborate with structural genomics centers, but can also take advantage of technical advances and tools developed by structural genomics centers and can employ a structural genomics approach to advancing biological understanding. Individual investigator-run non-structural biology laboratories can also collaborate with structural genomics centers, possibly influencing targeting decisions, but can also use structure based annotation tools enabled by the growing coverage of protein fold space provided by structural genomics.

These results demonstrated the in vitro genotoxicity of danthron and that 3T3 cells are capable of activating danthron. When NADP was replaced by NAD in the S9 mix, danthron remained mutagenic toward strain TA102. The addition of dicoumarol, a DT-diaphorase inhibitor, decreased the number of danthron-induced histidine revertants by 35\u201339%, indicating that DT-diaphorase is involved in the metabolic activation of danthron in the presence of NADH as an electron donor. In 3T3 cells, increases in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine levels as well as a reduction in GSH levels were induced by danthron in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that oxidative stress may be a major contributing pathway in the genotoxicity of danthron.",

Accordingly, these mutants were grouped in pre- and post-replication repair pathways. However, studying mutants belonging to one particular repair pathway may not be adequate for examining chemical-induced genotoxicity when other repair pathways may neutralize its effect. To test whether both pre-and post-replication pathways are involved and effect of Cr(III)- and Cr(VI)-induced genotoxicity in absence or presence of others, we used double mutant approach in D. melanogaster. We observed DNA damage as evident by changes in Comet assay DNA migration in cells of larvae of Oregon R+ and single mutants of pre- (mei-9, mus201 and mus210) and post- (mei-41, mus209 and mus309) replication repair pathways and also in double mutants of different combinations (pre\u2013pre, pre\u2013post and post\u2013post replication repair) exposed to increasing concentrations of Cr(VI) (0.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) for 48\u00a0h. The damage was greater in pre-replication repair mutants after exposure to 5.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Cr(VI), while effects on Oregon R+ and post replication repair mutants were insignificant. Post-replication repair mutants revealed significant DNA damage after exposure to 20.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml Cr(VI). Further, double mutants generated in the above repair categories were examined for DNA damage following Cr(VI) exposure and a comparison of damage was studied between single and double mutants. Combinations of double mutants generated in the pre\u2013pre replication repair pathways showed an indifferent interaction between the two mutants after Cr(VI) exposure while a synergistic interaction was evident in exposed post\u2013post replication repair double mutants. Cr(III) (20.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) exposure to these strains did not induce any significant DNA damage in their cells. The study suggests that both pre- and post-replication pathways are affected in Drosophila by Cr(VI) leading to genotoxicity, which may have consequences for metal-induced carcinogenesis.",

In order to investigate the basis of this dual effect, experiments were carried out to compare the influence of pretreatment with intact SCC and that of its constituents, the metal-free protoporphyrin (PP-IX) and copper as CuCl2. The wing-spot test was employed to monitor mutational events in somatic cells of Drosophila melanogaster. Heterozygous mwh+/+flr3 larvae were treated for 24\u00a0h with SCC, PP-IX, CuCl2 or sucrose. Following this treatment, one group of larvae were immediately allowed to feed on instant medium containing 0.5\u00a0mM N-nitroso-N-ethylurea (ENU) dissolved in phosphate buffer to reach pH 6. The remaining larvae received treatment with ENU with a delay of 1, 2 or 3\u00a0days (DTD). Results revealed an (a) overall inhibitory effect for 0-DTD and 1-DTD after pretreatment with SCC, (b) only in 0-DTD after PP-IX, and (c) in all DTDs after treatment with CuCl2. These results provide evidence that the copper ion plays a central role in the antimutagenic effect of SCC, and for a sustained period of time. Pretreatment with SCC and PP-IX produced a promoter effect at 2-DTD and 3-DTD. The results could be explained as an effect of the accumulation of metal-free porphyrin following the dissociation of the copper\u2013porphyrin complex (SCC), the copper-ion reaching proteins to form complexes and participated in anabolic pathways.",

Possible genotoxic and carcinogenic effects of ELF-MF have also been discussed and tested. In this study, we analysed the effect of ELF-MF on chromatin conformation in E. coli GE499 cells by the anomalous viscosity time-dependence (AVTD) technique. Possible genotoxic effects of the specific combination of static and ELF-MF, which has been proven to affect chromatin conformation, were investigated by a clonogenic assay, by assessing cell-growth kinetics, and by analysis of the SOS-response by means of inducible recA-lacZ fusion-gene products and the \u03b2-galactosidase assay. The genotoxic agent nalidixic acid (NAL) was used as a positive control and in combination with ELF-MF. Nalidixic acid at 3\u201330\u00a0\u03bcg/ml decreased the AVTD peaks and induced a cytotoxic effect. In contrast to NAL, ELF-MF fields increased AVTD, stimulated cell growth, and increased cloning efficiency. These effects depended on the frequency within the range of 7\u201311\u00a0Hz. While NAL induced an SOS-response, exposure to ELF-MF did not induce the recA-lacZ fusion-gene product. Exposure to ELF-MF did not modify the genotoxic effects of NAL either. All together, the data show that ELF-MF, under specific conditions of exposure, acted as a non-toxic but cell-growth stimulating agent.",

     "abstract": "Methionine is a component of one-carbon metabolism and a precursor of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the methyl donor for DNA methylation. When methionine intake is high, an increase of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is expected. DNA methyltransferases convert SAM to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). A high intracellular SAH concentration could inhibit the activity of DNA methyltransferases. Therefore, high methionine ingestion could induce DNA damage and change the methylation pattern of tumor suppressor genes. This study investigated the genotoxicity of a methionine-supplemented diet. It also investigated the diet's effects on glutathione levels, SAM and SAH concentrations and the gene methylation pattern of p53. Wistar rats received either a methionine-supplemented diet (2% methionine) or a control diet (0.3% methionine) for six weeks. The methionine-supplemented diet was neither genotoxic nor antigenotoxic to kidney cells, as assessed by the comet assay. However, the methionine-supplemented diet restored the renal glutathione depletion induced by doxorubicin. This fact may be explained by the transsulfuration pathway, which converts methionine to glutathione in the kidney. Methionine supplementation increased the renal concentration of SAH without changing the SAM/SAH ratio. This unchanged profile was also observed for DNA methylation at the promoter region of the p53 gene. Further studies are necessary to elucidate this diet's effects on genomic stability and DNA methylation.",

     "abstract": "Azoxymethane (AOM) is a methylating agent capable of inducing mutations in DNA by forming adducts with DNA bases. It has been used to understand the mechanisms involved in colon carcinogenesis. Of the adducts formed in response to AOM, O6-methyl-2\u2032-deoxy-guanosine (O6-mdGua) is the most mutagenic. Based on studies in rodents of the abundance and persistence of DNA adducts in various tissues after treatment with alkylating agents, previous results suggest, as a generalization, that the longer O6-mdGua adducts remain unrepaired in the cells of a tissue, the greater the risk for tumorigenesis. To test this hypothesis, we have built on these studies, expanding the number of tissues in which O6-mdGua abundance and persistence were examined and correlating these data with tumour distribution and abundance in rats maintained for 26 weeks after the treatment with AOM. Our study revealed firstly the existence of groups of tissues that developed relatively large amounts (proximal and distal colon, proximal small intestine (SI), liver and kidney) and relatively low levels (stomach, distal SI, bladder, spleen, blood and lung) of O6-mdGua after AOM exposure. Secondly, while all tissues showed an increase in adduct levels at 6\u00a0h after mutagen treatment and most showed a significant drop in adduct levels between 6\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h (stomach, proximal and distal SI, liver, spleen, blood and lung), one group of tissues displayed O6-mdGua levels that did not decrease at 48\u00a0h (proximal and distal colon, kidney and bladder). Predictably, the colon displayed tumours 26 weeks after treatment. Interestingly, however, the proximal SI also displayed significant tumour formation at that time. Our findings demonstrate (1) a direct association between exposure to O6-mdGua and tumours of the distal colon and (2) a dissociation of the relationship between adduct clearance and tumorigenesis in the SI. This diversity of response in the gastrointestinal tract warrants further analysis.",

Groups of 12 rats each were exposed to the target concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 10 and 15\u00a0ppm. The micronucleus test (MNT) was performed with nasal epithelial cells prepared from six animals per group. Two thousand cells per animal were analysed for the presence of MN. The other six rats per group were subcutaneously implanted with osmotic pumps containing 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd), three days prior to necropsy. Paraffin sections were made from the nasal cavity (four levels) of these animals for histopathology and cell-proliferation measurements. The frequency of cells with MN was not increased in any of the groups. However, there was also no induction of MN in nasal cells of rats exposed to a single dose of cyclophosphamide (CP, 20\u00a0mg/kg) by gavage and analysed 3, 7, 14 or 28 days after the treatment. In contrast, nasal epithelial cells from rats exposed to 10 or 15\u00a0ppm FA vapour showed clear site-specific pathological changes (focal epithelial degeneration, inflammation and squamous metaplasia) in a decreasing gradient (anterior to posterior). Analysis of slides after anti-BrdUrd antibody staining clearly indicated increased cell proliferation (unit length labelling indices, ULLI) after exposure to 6\u00a0ppm and higher. No treatment-related effects were measured after exposure to 0.5, 1 and 2\u00a0ppm. When comparing the cell-proliferation rate of normal epithelium with that of directly adjacent metaplastic epithelium, no consistent pattern was found: depending on the location, cell proliferation of normal epithelia was either higher or lower. Our results support previous findings demonstrating local cytotoxic effects in the nose of rats after inhalation of FA. However, induction of MN in the nasal epithelium as an indicator of a mutagenic effect was not seen. Because only limited experience exists for the MNT with rat nasal epithelial cells, this result has to be interpreted with great care. The contribution of mutagenicity to FA's carcinogenicity in rat nasal epithelium remains unclear.",

Based on the use of a filter, cigarette smoke can be divided into a gas phase and a tar phase. Both contain different concentrations of oxidants, free radicals and tobacco-specific carcinogens. To explore the effects of both filtered and non-filtered cigarette smoke on DNA damage and oxidative status, we measured the level of mononuclear leukocyte DNA damage by use of the single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. We also determined malondialdehyde (MDA), protein carbonyl content (PC) and total antioxidative capacity (TAC) levels in blood plasma of smokers of manufactured filter-cigarettes and of hand-rolled cigarettes. Cotinine levels were also measured in plasma to estimate the degree of smoking. Mononuclear leukocyte DNA damage, plasma MDA, plasma PC and plasma cotinine levels were found significantly higher, while plasma TAC levels were found significantly lower in smokers of filter-cigarettes and smokers of hand-rolled cigarettes, compared with control subjects. TAC levels in hand-rolled and manufactured filter-cigarette smokers were not significantly different from each other. However, the levels of DNA damage, plasma MDA, plasma cotinine, and plasma protein oxidation were significantly higher in hand-rolled cigarette smokers than in filter-cigarette smokers. There was a significant positive correlation between MDA and DNA damage in both hand-rolled cigarette smokers and manufactured filter-cigarette smokers. This study indicates that smoking of hand-rolled cigarettes has stronger genotoxic and oxidative effects on the metabolism than smoking of manufactured filter-cigarettes. We propose that these harmful effects could be attributed to the higher level of oxidants.",

Additionally, it was found that EPS might exert blocking and bioanticytotoxic effects by both adjusting the function of intestine 407 and repairing the 4-NQO-damaged cells, thus reducing cytotoxicity of 4-NQO.",

This work has been accomplished with hematopoietic cells, most often rat peripheral blood erythrocytes (RBCs) and reticulocytes (RETs). The current report describes new sample processing procedures that dramatically increase the rate at which cells can be evaluated for GPI anchor deficiency. This new method was applied to blood specimens from vehicle, 1,3-propane sultone, melphalan, and N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea treated Sprague Dawley rats. Leukocyte- and platelet-depleted blood samples were incubated with anti-CD59-phycoerythrin (PE) and anti-CD61-PE, and then mixed with anti-PE paramagnetic particles and Counting Beads (i.e., fluorescent microspheres). An aliquot of each specimen was stained with SYTO 13 and flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine RET percentage, RET:Counting Bead ratio, and RBC:Counting Bead ratio. The major portion of these specimens were passed through ferromagnetic columns that were suspended in a magnetic field, thereby depleting each specimen of wild-type RBCs (and platelets) based on their association with anti-PE paramagnetic particles. The eluates were concentrated via centrifugation and the resulting suspensions were stained with SYTO 13 and analyzed on the flow cytometer to determine mutant phenotype RET:Counting Bead and mutant phenotype RBC:Counting Bead ratios. The ratios obtained from pre- and post-column analyses were used to derive mutant phenotype RET and mutant phenotype RBC frequencies. Results from vehicle control and genotoxicant-treated rats are presented that indicate the scoring system is capable of returning reliable mutant phenotype cell frequencies. Using this wild-type cell depletion strategy, it was possible to interrogate \u22653 million RETs and \u2265100 million RBCs per rat in approximately 7\u00a0min. Beyond considerably enhancing the throughput capacity of the analytical platform, these blood-processing procedures were also shown to enhance the precision of the measurements.",

     "abstract": "Diseases related to ethanol abuse, especially binge drinking, are becoming one of the most costly health problems in the world. Ethanol-induced DNA damage plays a key role in the etiology of these diseases. New compounds are expected to offer new options against ethanol-induced genotoxicity. It was found, for the first time, that resveratrol and three analogues with 3,5-dimethoxyl groups in the A-ring, such as (E)-4-(3,5-dimethoxystyryl)phenol (RV32), or with a quinolyl in the B-ring, such as (E)-5-[2-(quinolin-4-yl)vinyl]benzene-1,3-diol (RV01) and (E)-4-(3,5-dimethoxystyryl)quinoline (RV02), strongly inhibited ethanol-induced oxidative DNA damage in human peripheral lymphocytes in vitro. Resveratrol and RV32 with more hydroxyl groups in structures showed stronger direct scavenging activity of hydroxyl radicals than RV01 and RV02. Moreover, all compounds reduced hydroxyl radical generation by regulating the mRNA expression of alcohol dehydrogenase 1B and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase 2. Further studies proved resveratrol and three analogues activated the base excision repair system in transcriptional and protein levels in DNA repair process. Both 3,5-dimethoxyl groups and quinolyl modification may enhance such activity. In summary, resveratrol and its three analogues revealed significant protective activity against ethanol-induced oxidative DNA damage in human peripheral lymphocytes, which demonstrates their potential for use in prevention and treatment of the diseases related to ethanol abuse.",

All the street boys were tobacco users. In addition, 155 were addicted to gasp an industrial adhesive popularly known as \u2018Golden glue\u2019. Micronucleus (MN) frequency was determined as a measure of chromosomal breakage in exfoliated buccal epithelial cells (BECs) and DNA double strand breaks were quantitatively assessed by counting \u03b3-H2AX foci using immunofluorescence microscopy. Micronucleated cell frequencies (MCFs) in BEC of glue non-addicted (only tobacco) and addicted (tobacco plus glue) street boys were 1.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.06\u2030 and 4.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.55\u2030 respectively, which were significantly higher than that of control (0.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u2030, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

Spearman's rank correlation revealed a strong positive association between years of glue addiction with MCFs and \u03b3-H2AX foci numbers, and the association between glue addiction and chromosomal and DNA damage remained positive and significant after controlling income, spending on addiction and loss of appetite as potential confounders in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Thus, addiction to tobacco among the street children in India is associated with chromosomal and DNA damage in BECs and the severity of these changes is significantly increased by the habit of sniffing/huffing of industrial glue.",

However, it has been suggested that exposure to nanoparticles may be a risk for the development of vascular diseases due to injury and dysfunction of the vascular endothelium. Therefore, in the present study, the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were evaluated. Optical and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) study showed that MWCNTs were able to enter cells rapidly, distribute in the cytoplasm and intracellular vesicles and induce morphological changes. Exposure to MWCNTs reduced the viability of HUVECs, and induced apoptosis in HUVECs. Furthermore, MWCNTs could cause DNA damage as indicated by the formation of \u03b3H2AX foci. MWCNTs also affected cellular redox status, e.g., increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as altering superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels. On the other hand, the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) preincubation can inhibit the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of MWCNTs. Taken together, these results demonstrated that MWCNTs could induce cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in HUVECs, probably through oxidative damage pathways.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the combined toxic effects of these chemicals and the related mechanism. L02 cells were exposed to BDE47 (5, 10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) or/and BaP (50\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) in different administration order. The cell growth and survival, DNA strand breaks, oxidative stress index (ROS, SOD, GSH, and MDA), LDH release and the expression level of CYP1 family members were measured. The result showed that BDE47 or/and BaP had no effect on the cell growth and survival under the present conditions. However, compared with the groups treated with BDE47 or BaP alone, the combined-treated groups induced significantly elevated DNA strand breaks, ROS production, and MDA level. Especially, pretreatment with BDE47 followed by BaP led to the strongest effects. Addition of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) markedly reduced the ROS level and partly suppressed the DNA strand breaks induced by BDE47 or/and BaP. Meanwhile, the combined treatment groups also markedly increased the SOD activity, GSH content, and LDH release level compared with the control group. The real-time PCR results showed that BaP could significantly induce the expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, however, the pre-treatment with BDE47 appeared to attenuate the BaP-induced CYP1 expression. All of above findings indicated that BDE47 and BaP had a synergistic effect on oxidatively generated DNA damage in L02 cells via regulation on the oxidative stress response and the expression of CYP1 metabolism enzymes.",

To obtain mechanistic insight into NA-induced nasal carcinogenesis, NA dose\u2013response was characterized in nasal epithelium using a tumor-relevant endpoint. Specifically, levels of p53 codon 271 CGT to CAT mutation were measured in nasal respiratory and olfactory epithelium of NA-exposed male and female rats by allele-specific competitive blocker-PCR (ACB-PCR). Male and female, 8\u20139 week-old F344 rats (5 rats/group) were exposed to 0, 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 30\u00a0ppm NA vapor for 13 weeks (6\u00a0h/day, 5 days/week). The geometric mean p53 mutant fraction (MF) levels in nasal epithelium of control treatment groups ranged between 2.05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 and 3.05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125. No significant dose-related changes in p53 mutant fraction (MF) were observed in the olfactory or respiratory epithelia of female rats. However, statistically significant treatment-related differences were observed in male respiratory and olfactory epithelium, with the p53 MF in the respiratory epithelium of male rats exposed to 30\u00a0ppm NA significantly lower than that in controls. Further, a significant trend of decreasing p53 MF with increasing dose was observed in the male respiratory epithelium. Of the tissue types analyzed, respiratory epithelium is the most sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of NA, suggesting cytotoxicity may be responsible for the loss of p53 mutation. Because ACB-PCR has been used successfully to detect the effects of known mutagenic carcinogens, the absence of any significant increases in p53 MF associated with NA exposure adds to the weight of evidence that NA does not operate through a directly mutagenic mode of action.",

     "abstract": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II) is an X-linked recessive disease caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate-2-sulfatase, leading to progressive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in nearly all cell types, tissues and organs. Enzyme replacement therapy reduces the storage of these substances in the lysosomes. Oxidative stress is related to the pathophysiology of many disorders, including inborn errors of metabolism. Oxidative damage to protein and lipid has been described in MPS types I and III. The aim of this study was to analyze DNA damage, as determined by the alkaline comet assay using silver staining, in peripheral leukocytes from MPS II patients before treatment and during the first six months of enzyme replacement therapy. We also correlated DNA damage with lipid and protein oxidative damages, analyzed by plasma malondialdehyde levels and carbonyl group content, respectively. We found a significant increase in lipid and protein damage in MPS II patients before treatment when compared to controls. Also, our results showed greater DNA damage in terms of damage index (DI) in pretreatment MPS II patients (DI\u00a0=\u00a018.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4) when compared to controls (DI\u00a0=\u00a066.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0). Enzyme replacement therapy led to a significant decrease in levels of malondialdehyde and DNA damage when compared to pretreatment, but did not reach control values. Significant positive correlations between DNA damage and malondialdehyde levels, as well as carbonyl group content, were observed. Our findings indicate that MPS II patients are subject to DNA damage and that enzyme replacement therapy is able to protect against this process.",

Furthermore, our aim was to show if there is an association between oxidative stress and DNA damage in RA. This study was conducted between January and June 2010 in the Erzurum Training and Research Hospital. We analyzed lymphocytes from patients with RA (12 in active and 31 in inactive periods) and 30 healthy controls for effects in the comet assay and the MN test. In addition, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) rate were determined in all the subjects. The comet-tail length, the MN frequencies and the MDA levels were significantly higher in patients \u2013 both in the active and the inactive period \u2013 than in the controls. In contrast, the SOD and GSH-Px levels were significantly lower in both patient groups than in the controls. Our results suggest that an increased plasma MDA level and decreased plasma GSH-Px and SOD levels reflect the higher degree of oxidative stress in RA patients, a situation that may impair genetic stability in those patients. Thus, the results suggest that increased DNA damage may play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA.",

Formation of micronuclei and apoptotic-like bodies was evaluated by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test. Measurements were performed for five different phantom depths (3\u201320\u00a0cm). Irradiated cells were placed in a water-phantom in three variants: directly on the axis in the beam, under shielding (only in photon radiation) and outside the beam field.The results reveal a discrepancy between the distribution of physical dose at different depths of the water-phantom and biological effects. This discrepancy is of special significance in case of cells irradiated at a greater depth or placed outside the field and under shield during the exposure to radiation. The frequency of cytogenetic damage was higher than the expected value based on the physical dose received at different depths.Cells placed outside the beam axis were exposed to scattered radiation at very low doses, so we tested if bystander effects could have had a role in the observed discrepancy between physical radiation dose and biological response. We explored this question by use of a medium-transfer technique in which medium (ICM\u2014irradiation conditioned medium) from irradiated cells was transferred to non-irradiated (bystander) cells. The results indicate that when cells were incubated in ICM transferred from cells irradiated at bigger depths or from cells exposed outside the radiation field, the number of apoptotic and micronucleated cells was similar to that after direct irradiation. This suggests that these damages are caused by factors released by irradiated cells into the medium rather than being induced directly in DNA by X-rays. Evaluation of biological effects of scattered radiation appears useful for clinical practice.",

The exposure to this substance is epidemiologically linked to cancer and to nuclear changes detected by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus test (CBMN). This method is extensively used in molecular epidemiology, since it provides information on several biomarkers of genotoxicity, such as micronuclei (MN), which are biomarkers of chromosomes breakage or loss, nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB), common biomarkers of chromosome rearrangement, poor repair and/or telomere fusion, and nuclear buds (NBUD), biomarkers of elimination of amplified DNA.The aim of this study is to compare the frequency of genotoxicity biomarkers, provided by the CBMN assay in peripheral lymphocytes and the MN test in buccal cells, between individuals occupationally exposed and non-exposed to formaldehyde and other environmental factors, namely tobacco and alcohol consumption.The sample comprised two groups: 56 individuals occupationally exposed to formaldehyde (cases) and 85 unexposed individuals (controls), from whom both peripheral blood and exfoliated epithelial cells of the oral mucosa were collected in order to measure the genetic endpoints proposed in this study.The mean level of TWA8h was 0.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0ppm (<detection limit until 0.51\u00a0ppm) and the mean of ceiling values was 1.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74\u00a0ppm (0.18\u20132.93\u00a0ppm). All genotoxicity biomarkers showed significant increases in exposed workers in comparison with controls (Mann\u2013Whitney test, p\u00a0<\u00a00.002) and the analysis of confounding factors showed that there were no differences between genders.As for age, only the mean MN frequency in lymphocytes was found significantly higher in elderly people among the exposed groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), and there was also evidence of an interaction between age and gender with regards to that biomarker in those exposed.Smoking habits did not influence the frequency of the biomarkers, whereas alcohol consumption only influenced the MN frequency in lymphocytes in controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), with drinkers showing higher mean values.

To consider the significance of positive results, it is important to know whether DNA adducts are formed in the cells treated with the test compound. Recently, Matsuda et al. developed the DNA adductome approach to detect DNA adducts comprehensively ([4] Kanaly, et al., Antioxid. Redox Signal., 2006, 8, 993\u20131001). We applied this method to assess the DNA-damaging capability of in vitro MN test-positive compounds. CHL/IU cells were treated with compounds from three categories: (1) carcinogens causing DNA alkylation, ethyl methanesulfonate and N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; (2) carcinogens producing DNA bulky adducts, 2-amino-6-phenyl-1-methylimidazo[4,5-b]pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide, and (3) non-carcinogens, caffeine, maltol, and sodium chloride, with or without metabolic activation. With the conditions in which all test compounds gave positive results in the MN tests, DNA was extracted from the cells and hydrolyzed to deoxyribonucleosides, which were subsequently subjected to LC/ESI-MS/MS analysis. All carcinogens (categories 1 and 2) produced various DNA adduct peaks, and some of the m/z peak values corresponded to known adducts. No non-carcinogens produced DNA adducts, indicating that these compounds produced MN through different mechanisms from the adduct formation. These results indicate that the adductome approach is useful to demonstrate DNA damage formation of MN test-positive compounds and to understand their mechanisms of action.",

     "abstract": "In vitro genotoxicity testing needs to include tests in both bacterial and mammalian cells, and be able to detect gene mutations, chromosomal damage and aneuploidy. This may be achieved by a combination of the Ames test (detects gene mutations) and the in vitro micronucleus test (MNvit), since the latter detects both chromosomal aberrations and aneuploidy. In this paper we therefore present an analysis of an existing database of rodent carcinogens and a new database of in vivo genotoxins in terms of the in vitro genotoxicity tests needed to detect their in vivo activity. Published in vitro data from at least one test system (most were from the Ames test) were available for 557 carcinogens and 405 in vivo genotoxins. Because there are fewer publications on the MNvit than for other mammalian cell tests, and because the concordance between the MNvit and the in vitro chromosomal aberration (CAvit) test is so high for clastogenic activity, positive results in the CAvit test were taken as indicative of a positive result in the MNvit where there were no, or only inadequate data for the latter. Also, because Hprt and Tk loci both detect gene-mutation activity, a positive Hprt test was taken as indicative of a mouse-lymphoma Tk assay (MLA)-positive, where there were no data for the latter. Almost all of the 962 rodent carcinogens and in vivo genotoxins were detected by an in vitro battery comprising Ames\u00a0+\u00a0MNvit. An additional 11 carcinogens and six in vivo genotoxins would apparently be detected by the MLA, but many of these had not been tested in the MNvit or CAvit tests. Only four chemicals emerge as potentially being more readily detected in MLA than in Ames\u00a0+\u00a0MNvit \u2013 benzyl acetate, toluene, morphine and thiabendazole \u2013 and none of these are convincing cases to argue for the inclusion of the MLA in addition to Ames\u00a0+\u00a0MNvit. Thus, there is no convincing evidence that any genotoxic rodent carcinogens or in vivo genotoxins would remain undetected in an in vitro test battery consisting of Ames\u00a0+\u00a0MNvit.",

No difference in the distribution between cases and controls was observed for the haplotypes based on the four polymorphisms in the MTRR gene.The present study suggests that the 677TT genotype and the TA haplotype in the MTHFR gene may also have a role in colorectal cancer risk in the Czech population, indicating the importance of genes involved in folate metabolism with respect to cancer risk.

The exposed individuals showed significantly higher levels of lead in blood and zinc protoporphyrin, and significantly lower \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity than the controls, suggesting a relatively high lead exposure. Nevertheless, the limit of 70\u00a0\u03bcg/dl for lead in blood established by the Portuguese regulation was never reached. Results of the comet assay were not modified by the exposure, but a significant increase in the mutation frequency in the exposed workers was obtained in the T-cell receptor mutation assay. Furthermore, data obtained in the analysis of the different lymphocyte subsets showed a significant decrease in %CD8+ cells and a significant increase in the %CD4+/%CD8+ ratio in exposed individuals with regard to the controls. No clear effect was observed for vitamin D receptor genetic polymorphism on the parameters evaluated. In view of our results showing mutagenic and immunotoxic effects related to lead exposure in occupational settings, it seems that the Portuguese biological exposure limit for lead needs to be revised in order to increase the safety of exposed workers.",

     "abstract": "The intensive use of herbicides over the last few decades has caused a general increase of environmental pollution. It is thus very important to evaluate the possible genotoxic properties of these chemical compounds as well as identifying their mode of action. Phenylurea herbicides are selective agents widely used for the control of infestant plants. Of these herbicides, which are widely used in agriculture, we analysed four of the less intensively studied molecules. More precisely, we investigated the genotoxic effects of fenuron, chlorotoluron, diuron, and difenoxuron by analyses of chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in exposed mammalian cells. We used the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and epithelial liver (CHEL) cell lines, endowed with the absence or the presence, respectively, of an enzymatic system to activate pro-mutagenic compounds. Our results show that all herbicides tested induce, at high concentrations, an increasing number of CAs in non-metabolising CHO cells. Instead, in the exposed CHEL cell line, the four herbicides induced CAs also at the lowest dose-level. In the CHEL cells, a statistically significant increase of SCE was also observed. The phenylurea herbicides showed direct genotoxic activity, but the cytogenetic effects were greatly enhanced after metabolic conversion. These data, together with other information on phenylurea herbicides, are of great interest from the environmental point of view, and for human health. In fact, intensive use of herbicides contaminates soil, surface water, groundwater and agricultural products, and thus should be taken in particular consideration not only for those initiatives to specifically protect exposed workers, but also to safeguard the health of consumers of agricultural products.",

     "abstract": "Bulky DNA adducts are widely used as biomarkers of human exposure to complex mixtures of environmental genotoxicants including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. The 32P-postlabelling method is highly sensitive for the detection of bulky DNA adducts, but its relatively low throughput poses limits to its use in large-scale molecular epidemiological studies. The objectives of this study were to compare the impact of DNA-sample preparation with a commercial DNA-isolation kit or with the classical phenol-extraction procedure on the measurement of bulky DNA adducts by 32P-postlabelling, and to increase the throughput of the 32P-postlabelling method \u2013 whilst maintaining radio-safety \u2013 by reducing the radioisotope requirement per sample. The test DNA samples were prepared from MCF-7 cells treated with benzo[a]pyrene and from human peripheral blood lymphocytes, buffy coat, and peripheral lung tissue. The modified 32P-postlabelling procedure involved an evaporation-to-dryness step after the enzymatic digestions of the DNA, and radio-labelling with a reduced amount of [\u03b3-32P]ATP substrate in a reduced reaction volume compared with the regular method. Higher levels of DNA adducts were measured in the MCF-7 cells and in the lung-tissue samples after isolation with the kit than after solvent extraction. A seven-fold higher level of adducts was detected in the buffy-coat DNA samples isolated with the kit than with the phenol extraction procedure (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Reduction of the amount of [\u03b3-32P]ATP from 50\u00a0\u03bcCi to 25\u00a0\u03bcCi (>6000\u00a0Ci/mmol specific radioactivity) per sample in the modified 32P-postlabelling procedure was generally applicable without loss of adduct recovery for all test samples prepared with both DNA isolation methods. The difference between the bulky DNA-adduct levels resulting from the two DNA-isolation procedures requires further systematic investigation. The modified 32P-postlabelling procedure allows a 50% reduction of radioisotope requirement per sample, which facilitates increased throughput of the assay whilst maintaining radio-safety.",

In this system, any inactivating mutation at the TetR gene or large deletions including the gene itself results in high expression of GFP gene (>200-fold increase) in the cells, which can be readily scored not only by a flow cytometer but also under a fluorescent microscope. With this new cell line, we show that the spontaneous mutation rate at the TetR locus was 2.8\u20133.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126/cell division, slightly lower than the rate at the endogenous HPRT gene of HT1080 cells, and has a dose response to X rays as a mutagen. We also isolated variant clones with elevated spontaneous mutation rate (i.e., genetically unstable cells) following X irradiation. Spontaneous GFP-positive mutants were predominantly base-change mutations at the TetR gene while those obtained after X irradiation often contained large deletions which spanned up to 6\u00a0Mb. The results indicate that the bacterial TetR/TetO regulatory units work extremely well as a mutation detection system in human cells, and any part of the human genome may be tested for mutation sensitivity following targeted insertion of the TetR gene in a stably expressing gene.",

     "abstract": "Buccal cells are becoming a widely used tissue source for monitoring human exposure to occupational and environmental genotoxicants. A variety of methods exist for collecting buccal cells from the oral cavity, including rinsing with saline, mouthwash, or scraping the oral cavity. Buccal cells are also routinely cryopreserved with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), then examined later for DNA damage by the comet assay. The effects of these different sampling procedures on the integrity of buccal cells for measuring DNA damage are unknown. This study examined the influence of the collection and cryopreservation of buccal cells on cell survival and DNA integrity. In individuals who rinsed with Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS), the viability of leukocytes (90%) was significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) greater than that of epithelial cells (12%). Similar survival rates were found for leukocytes (88%) and epithelial cells (10%) after rinsing with Listerine\u00ae mouthwash. However, the viability of leukocytes after cryopreservation varied significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) with DMSO concentration. Cell survival was greatest at 5% DMSO. Cryopreservation also influenced the integrity of DNA in the comet assay. Although tail length and tail moment were comparable in fresh or cryopreserved samples, the average head intensity for cryopreserved samples was \u223c6 units lower (95% CI: 0.8\u201312 units lower) than for fresh samples (t25\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.36, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). These studies suggest that the collection and storage of buccal samples are critical factors for the assessment of DNA damage. Moreover, leukocytes appear to be a more reliable source of human tissue for assessing DNA damage and possibly other biochemical changes.",

Here we report a scorer-independent conversion curve to transform the values of DNA damage reported in arbitrary units (AU) into estimated percentage of DNA in the tail (E%T), and the results obtained in an intercomparison exercise where the effectiveness of this curve and two others proposed in the literature (E%T\u00a0=\u00a0AU/4 and E%T\u00a0=\u00a0(AU/5)\u00a0+\u00a010) were tested. To obtain the conversion curve, human lymphocytes were first treated with radiation or H2O2. Percentage of DNA in tail (%T) was then measured in 2100 comets (300\u00a0comets per treatment) using Casp image analysis software. Subsequently, using these values of %T, categories of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were assigned to comets with %T [0\u20131), [1\u201325), [25\u201345), [45\u201370), and >70, and DNA damage was calculated in AU, as usual. DNA damage was induced in the interval 24\u2013315\u00a0AU (1.54\u201365.23%T). The best-fit conversion curve obtained by regression analysis was E%T\u00a0=\u00a0(AU\u00a0\u2212\u00a025.87)/4.46. In the intercomparison exercise, ten scorers from nine laboratories analyzed the same comet images (recorded on a compact disc) visually. The values reported in comet categories were transformed into AU and subsequently into E%T, using the three approaches mentioned above. The best agreement between E%T and %T measured by the software (S%T) was obtained with the conversion curve reported here, where the slope of E%T versus S%T from the ten scorers was not different from 1. Using this conversion curve, the overall mean difference between E%T and S%T was 1.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.62 and 57 (81%) of E%T values differ from S%T by less than 5\u00a0units.

We investigated the effect of Zn deficiency or excess on genomic instability events and determined the optimal concentration of two Zn compounds that minimize DNA-damage events. The effects of Zn sulphate (ZnSO4) and Zn carnosine (ZnC) on cell proliferation were investigated in the WIL2-NS human lymphoblastoid cell line. DNA damage was determined by the use of both the comet assay and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome (CBMN-Cyt) assay. Zn-deficient medium (0\u00a0\u03bcM) was produced using Chelex treatment, and the two Zn compounds (i.e. ZnSO4 and ZnC) were tested at concentrations of 0.0, 0.4, 4.0, 16.0, 32.0 and 100.0\u00a0\u03bcM. Results from an MTT assay showed that cell growth and viability were decreased in Zn-depleted cells (0\u00a0\u03bcM) as well as at 32\u00a0\u03bcM and 100\u00a0\u03bcM for both Zn compounds (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). DNA strand-breaks, as measured by the comet assay, were found to be increased in Zn-depleted cells compared with the other treatment groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The CBMN-Cyt assay showed a significant increase in the frequency of both apoptotic and necrotic cells under Zn-deficient conditions (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Elevated frequencies of micronuclei (MNi), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) and nuclear buds (NBuds) were induced in Zn-depleted cells (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), whereas genome damage was reduced in supplemented cultures for both Zn compounds at 4\u00a0\u03bcM and 16\u00a0\u03bcM, possibly suggesting that these concentrations may be optimal for genome stability. The potential protective effect of ZnSO4 and ZnC was also investigated following exposure to 1.0\u00a0Gy \u03b3-radiation. Culture in medium containing these compounds at 4\u201332\u00a0\u03bcM prior to irradiation displayed significantly reduced frequencies of MNi, NPBs and NBuds compared with cells maintained in 0\u00a0\u03bcM medium (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Expression of \u03b3-H2AX and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase measured by western blotting was increased in Zn-depleted cells. These results suggest that Zn plays important role in genomic stability and that the optimal Zn concentration-range for prevention of DNA damage and cytotoxicity in vitro lies between 4 and 16\u00a0\u03bcM.",

The organs used were from a previous study performed to determine the persistence of 3-NBA-derived DNA adducts in target and non-target tissues (Bieler et al., Carcinogenesis 28 (2007) 1117\u20131121, [22]). NQO1 is the enzyme reducing 3-NBA to N-hydroxy-3-aminobenzanthrone (N-OH-3-ABA) and CYP1A enzymes oxidize a human metabolite of 3-NBA, 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA), to yield the same reactive intermediate. 3-NBA and 3-ABA are both activated to species forming DNA adducts by cytosols and/or microsomes isolated from rat lung, the target organ for 3-NBA carcinogenicity, and from liver and kidney. Each compound generated the same five DNA adducts detectable by 32P-postlabelling. When hepatic cytosols from rats treated with 0.2 or 2\u00a0mg/kg body weight of 3-NBA were incubated with 3-NBA, DNA adduct formation was 3.2- and 8.6-fold higher, respectively, than in incubations with cytosols from control animals. Likewise, cytosols isolated from lungs and kidneys of rats exposed to 3-NBA more efficiently activated 3-NBA than those of control rats. This increase corresponded to an increase in protein levels and enzymatic activities of NQO1. Incubations of hepatic, pulmonary or renal microsomes of 3-NBA-treated rats with 3-ABA led to an 9.6-fold increase in DNA-adduct formation relative to controls. The highest induction in DNA-adduct levels was found in lung. The stimulation of DNA-adduct formation correlated with expression of CYP1A1/2 induced by the intra-tracheal instillation of 3-NBA. The results demonstrate that 3-NBA induces NQO1 and CYP1A1/2 in livers, lungs and kidneys of rats after intra-tracheal instillation, thereby enhancing its own genotoxic and carcinogenic potential.",

Levels of urine U were used to categorize the cohort into low and high exposure groups. Exposure to DU occurred during friendly fire incidents in 1991 involving DU munitions resulting in inhalation and ingestion exposure to small particles of DU and soft tissue DU fragments from traumatic injuries. All of these Veterans are enrolled in a long term health surveillance program at the Baltimore Veterans Administration Medical Center. Blood was drawn from 35 exposed male veterans aged 36\u201359 years, then cultured and evaluated for micronuclei (MN) using the cytokinesis block method. The participants were divided into two exposure groups, low and high, based on their mean urine uranium (uU) concentrations. Poisson regression analyses with mean urine U concentrations, current smoking, X-rays in the past year and donor age as dependent variables revealed no significant relationships with MN frequencies.

     "abstract": "Sodium metabisulfite (SMB, Na2S2O5) is widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries, because of its ability to inhibit proliferation of microorganisms and its antioxidant properties. We have evaluated the genotoxic effects of SMB on different tissues of the mouse, by use of the comet assay (liver and blood cells) and the micronucleus test (blood and bone marrow cells). For all tissues, significant increases in damage index and damage frequency values were observed in the SMB-treated groups (1 and 2\u00a0g/kg doses) compared to the control animals. The Kruskal\u2013Wallis test showed that the mean micronucleus frequencies in peripheral blood and bone marrow cells of mice treated with the highest dose of SMB (2\u00a0g/kg) showed significant increases, when compared with controls, and a significant reduction in the ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes was also seen. No difference in results between sexes was observed. Our results show that high oral doses of SMB may pose a genotoxic risk.",

The cells were exposed to BPs at the concentrations of 30, 60, 120 and 240\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h, respectively. The quartz contents of native and active BPs were 6.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20 and 6.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10%, respectively. Gypsum and DQ-12 quartz served as negative and positive controls. The results of comet assay showed that DNA damage induced by native and active BPs was significantly higher than that induced by gypsum control (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 or <0.01), and increased with exposure concentration and duration. When the cells were exposed to BPs at the doses of 120 and 240\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for 72\u00a0h, DNA damage induced by active BPs and native BPs was significantly higher than that induced by DQ-12 quartz (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and DNA damage induced by active BPs enhanced significantly, as compared with native BPs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The results of CBMN assay demonstrated that both native BPs and active BPs could induce significant micronuclei, as compared with gypsum control (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 or <0.01). However, there was no significant difference of micronucleus frequency (MNF) among native BPs, active BPs and DQ-12 quartz. The water-soluble fractions from two kinds of BPs did not induce significant DNA damage and micronuclei. These findings indicated that the genotoxicity induced by active BPs and native BPs could be detected in comet assay and CBMN assay in vitro, the insoluble particle fractions from BPs may play a main role in the genotoxic effects induced by BPs.",

     "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a major public health problem in Tunisia as it concerns up to 30\u201335% of the adult population, raising important national issues on tobacco-related disease. The aim of this study was to establish whether cigarette smoking increases sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in peripheral blood lymphocytes of smokers (n\u00a0=\u00a014) compared with non-smokers (n\u00a0=\u00a015) in Sfax, Tunisia. The smokers were subdivided in two subgroups according to the duration of the smoking habit: heavy smokers (>10 years) and light smokers (\u226410 years). After signing a consent form, volunteers provided a blood sample (5\u00a0ml) to establish cell cultures during 72\u00a0h. For SCE analysis, 30 second-division metaphases were examined from each subject. We determined the frequency of SCE, the percentage of high-frequency cells (HFC) and that of the high-frequency cell individual (HFI). The results show a significantly higher SCE frequency in smokers (8.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.43) than in non-smokers (7.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). A significant difference in SCE frequency was also shown when comparing the two subgroups of smokers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Interestingly, no significant difference was found when comparing the light smokers with non-smokers (7.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 vs 7.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3, respectively, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The percentages of HFC and HFI were significantly higher in smokers (11.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8% and 78.6%, respectively) than in non-smokers (4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2% and 20%, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Our study indicates that the genotoxic effects in lymphocytes from healthy Tunisian smokers are most likely caused by cigarette-smoke constituents. This effect was mainly observed in smokers who had been smoking during more than 10 years. These results provide scientific evidence to urge the prevention of tobacco consumption.",

     "abstract": "An integrated approach based on environmental and biological monitoring, including the analysis of biomarkers of exposure [excretion of S-phenylmercapturic acid (S-PMA)], early biological effects [micronucleus (MN) frequency] and susceptibility (genetic polymorphisms), was applied to characterize benzene exposure in a group of 70 traffic policemen and 40 employees of the city of Bologna, Italy. Median personal benzene exposure was 6.55-fold higher for traffic policemen than for controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). This higher exposure was confirmed by a significant, 2.53-fold higher S-PMA excretion in traffic policemen compared with that observed for indoor workers (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Median MN frequency was also significantly higher in policemen compared with indoor workers (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), emphasizing the genotoxic effect potentially associated with benzene exposure. With regard to biomarkers of susceptibility, the analysis revealed that high epoxide hydrolase (mEH) (predicted) enzyme activity was significantly correlated with a lower median MN frequency (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). A gene\u2013gender interaction was observed for the glutathione-S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) genotype. The GSTM1-null genotype was associated with a significantly higher median MN frequency in men, not in women. Statistical analysis did not reveal any association between the presence of the protective allele, pushing the pathway towards benzene detoxification, and MN frequency or S-PMA excretion.Even though there are some limitations in the study, our results indicate that policemen are exposed to higher levels of benzene than individuals spending most of the time indoors. This higher exposure may contribute to DNA damage, suggesting an increase health risk from traffic benzene emission. Finally, a more comprehensive study is warranted in order to better elucidate the involvement of EPHX1 genotypes combination in benzene genotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "This study compared the sensitivity of differentiated hepatocyte-like cells, their progenitor mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and CD34+ stem cells to DNA damage and toxicity induced by aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The hepatocyte-like cells and their progenitor cells (isolated from umbilical cord blood (UCB)) were each treated with AFB1 on day 15 of differentiation. Cell toxicity and genotoxicity effects were assessed using MTT and alkaline comet assays. AFB1 treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The IC50 values of AFB1 for hepatocytes differentiated from CD34+ and MSCs were within the same range (44.7\u201346.8\u00a0\u03bcM). The IC50 calculated for non-differentiated MSCs and CD34+ cells was slightly lower (42.0\u201343.4\u00a0\u03bcM) than that calculated for their differentiated counterparts. However, the extent of DNA damage was different in differentiated and non-differentiated cells. The percentages of DNA (% DNA) in comet tails measured in hepatocytes differentiated from MSCs exposed to AFB1 (0, 2.5, 10 and 20\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h were \u223c15, 55, 65 and 70%, respectively. In comparison, hepatocytes from CD34+ cells were more resistant to AFB1-induced DNA damage. Hepatocyte-MSCs were most sensitive to DNA damage, followed by UCB-CD34+ cells, then UCB-MSCs and finally hepatocyte-CD34+ cells. These results clearly showed that stem cells from different sources have different sensitivities to DNA damaging agents. These differences can be assigned to the expression levels of cytochrome P450 (CYP) particularly CYP3A4 in non-differentiated and differentiated cells. These data are useful in better understanding the susceptibility/resistance of stem cells in the process of differentiation to environmental toxicants.",

Episesamin showed negative results in the Ames test with and without S9 mix, in the in vitro chromosomal aberration test with and without S9 mix, and in the in vivo comet assay. Sesamin showed negative results in the Ames test with and without S9 mix. In the in vitro chromosomal aberration test, sesamin did not induce chromosomal aberrations in the absence of S9 mix, but induced structural abnormalities at cytotoxic concentrations in the presence of S9 mix. Oral administration of sesamin at doses up to 2.0\u00a0g/kg did not cause a significant increase in either the percentage of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the in vivo bone marrow MN test or in the % DNA in the comet tails in the in vivo comet assay of liver cells.

In this study the effects of copper (Cu2+) contamination were determined at the molecular and population levels in eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) seedlings exposed to various concentrations of the metal ion. Inhibition of root growth, reduction in dry weight and total soluble protein content in the roots of eggplant seedlings were observed with increasing Cu2+ concentrations. In ecotoxicology, analysis by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) has been applied as a suitable biomarker assay for plants. For the RAPD analyses, nine RAPD primers were found to produce unique polymorphic band patterns and were subsequently used to produce a total of 80 and 168 bands in the roots of untreated and treated eggplant seedlings, respectively. The changes in RAPD profiles after Cu2+ contamination were considered as variations, i.e. as gain and/or loss of bands compared with control seedlings. These results suggest that changes in genomic template stability could be detected with RAPD profiles and this result could be compared with the growth, dry weight and total soluble protein content of the seedlings grown at various Cu2+ concentrations.The measurements of parameters at the molecular and population levels are fundamental to accumulate valuable information and to understand clearly the effect of a contaminant on an organism in ecotoxicology.",

The comet assay is a phenotypic measure of the combined effects of sensitivity to a mutagen exposure and repair capacity. In this paper, we evaluate the association of the DNA repair kinetics, as measured by the comet assay, with prostate cancer risk. In a pilot study of 55 men with prostate cancer, 53 men without the disease, and 71 men free of cancer at biopsy, we investigated the association of DNA damage with prostate cancer risk at early (0\u201315\u00a0min) and later (15\u201345\u00a0min) stages following gamma-radiation exposure. Although residual damage within 45\u00a0min was the same for all groups (65% of DNA in comet tail disappeared), prostate cancer cases had a slower first phase (38% vs. 41%) and faster second phase (27% vs. 22%) of the repair response compared to controls. When subjects were categorized into quartiles, according to efficiency of repairing DNA damage, high repair-efficiency within the first 15\u00a0min after exposure was not associated with prostate cancer risk while higher at the 15\u201345\u00a0min period was associated with increased risk (OR for highest-to-lowest quartiles\u00a0=\u00a03.24, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.98\u201310.66, p-trend\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

     "abstract": "The traditionally accepted biological basis for the late stochastic effects of ionizing radiation (cancer and hereditary disease), i.e. target theory, has so far been unable to accommodate the more recent findings of non-cancer disease and the so-called non-targeted effects, genomic instability and bystander effect, thus creating uncertainty in radiation risk estimation. We propose that ionizing radiation can give rise to these effects through two distinct and independent routes, one essentially genetic, termed here type A, and the other essentially epigenetic, termed type B. Type B processes entail envisaging phenotype as represented by a dynamic attractor and radiation acting as an agent that stresses cellular processes leading to the adoption of a variant attractor/phenotype. Evidence from the literature indicates that type B processes can lead to the inheritance of variant cell attractors and mediate a category of trans-generational effects quite distinct from classical Mendelian inherited disease, which is type A. The causal relationships for radiation-induced somatic human health detriment, i.e., cancer and non-cancer (e.g., cardiovascular) disease, are discussed from the point of view of the proposed classification.This approach unifies at a fundamental level the heritable and late somatic effects of radiation into a single causal framework that has the potential to be extended to the effects of the other environmental agents damaging to health.",

Human polymerase kappa (Pol \u03ba) bypasses benzo[a]pyrene diolepoxide-N2-deoxyguanine (BPDE-N2-dG) DNA adducts in an almost error-free manner. To better understand the relationship between the structural features in the active site and lesion bypass by Pol \u03ba, we mutated codons corresponding to amino acids appearing close to the adducts in the active site, and compared bypass efficiencies. Remarkably, the substitution of alanine for phenylalanine 171 (F171), an amino acid conserved between Pol \u03ba and its bacterial counterpart Escherichia coli DinB, enhanced the efficiencies of dCMP incorporation opposite (\u2212)- and (+)-trans-anti-BPDE-N2-dG 18-fold. This substitution affected neither the fidelity of TLS nor the efficiency of dCMP incorporation opposite normal guanine. This amino acid change also enhanced the binding affinity of Pol \u03ba to template/primer DNA containing (\u2212)-trans-anti-BPDE-N2-dG. These results suggest that F171 functions as a molecular brake for TLS across BPDE-N2-dG by Pol \u03ba and that the F171A derivative of Pol \u03ba bypasses these DNA lesions more actively than does the wild-type enzyme.",

     "abstract": "Although no statistically significant hereditary effects have yet been detected in the children of survivors from the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, recent animal studies have found that exposure to ionizing radiation can cause genomic and epigenomic instability in the exposed individuals, as well as their offspring, and therefore, may have much larger genetic effects than predicted by earlier studies. When individuals are exposed to various environmental insults, including radiation, individual sensitivity to the insults often varies. Variance in germ-line response to radiation among individuals has been widely recognized, but it is difficult to address due to the use of inbred strains and the limited number of offspring that can be produced by a pair of mice, the common model used to study genetic effects of radiation. Herein is the first study to examine individual family responses to ionizing radiation using a parent-pedigree approach in an outbred strain of a vertebrate model, the Japanese medaka fish. Changes in frequencies of radiation-induced germline mutations at nine microsatellite loci were examined in the same families before and after exposure to one of four acute doses of ionizing radiation (0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 5\u00a0Gy, plus sham-exposed controls). Families varied significantly in pre-exposure mutation frequencies and responses to irradiation, but germline mutations were elevated in at least one family after 0.1, 0.5, and 5\u00a0Gy exposures. Variance among individuals in sensitivity to radiation is well documented for many endpoints, and our work now extends these endpoints to include germ-line mutations. Further studies are needed to elucidate dose response, effects at varying stages of spermatogenesis, and the mechanisms underlying the variance in these individual responses to radiation.",

They can be isolated from many plants by mechanical pressing or hydro- and steam-distillation and are known to induce a wide range of biological effects through their antibacterial, antifungal, cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimutagenic activities. In order to explore their beneficial properties on human skin cells, we investigated the effects of an essential oil from rosewood Aniba rosaeodora (REO) on the human epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431, on immortal HaCaT cells thought to represent an early stage of skin carcinogenesis, on transformed normal HEK001 keratinocytes and on primary normal NHEK keratinocytes. In a defined range of concentrations, REO selectively killed A431 and HaCaT cells. The same treatments had only a minor cytotoxic effect on HEK001 and NHEK cells. Preferentially in A431 and HaCaT cells, REO triggered the production of reactive oxygen species, induced depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane and caused caspase-dependent cell death characterized by phosphatidylserine externalization, an early marker of apoptosis. Both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were implicated in REO-induced cell death. The identification of selective induction of apoptosis in precancerous and cancerous skin cells by REO highlights the potential anticancer activity of this essential oil.",

     "abstract": "In view of the scarcely available information on the in vivo mutagenic and co-mutagenic activity of nickel, the genotoxic potential of two nickel-compounds, nickel chloride (NiCl2) and nickel sulphate (NiSO4), was assessed in Drosophila melanogaster by measuring two different genetic endpoints. On the one hand, we used the wing-spot assay, which is based on the principle that the loss of heterozygosity of two suitable recessive markers, multiple wing hairs (mwh) and flare-3 (flr3), can lead to the formation of mutant clones in the imaginal disks of larval cells. On the other hand, the in vivo comet assay, which detects single- and double-strand DNA breaks, was also used with larval haemocytes. These cells offer several advantages: they are highly sensitive to genotoxic agents, the sampling and processing methodologies are quite simple and the level of basal DNA damage is relatively low. No significant increases in the frequencies of the three categories of mutant spots (i.e. small single spots, large single spots, and twin spots) were observed in the wing-spot assay; however, NiSO4 induced significant dose-dependent increases in DNA damage in the comet assay. In addition, the combined treatments with gamma-radiation and NiCl2 and NiSO4 showed a slight but significant increase in the frequency of the three categories of mutant spots compared with the frequency induced by gamma-radiation alone, indicating that both nickel compounds have a synergistic interaction. These results support the assumption that both nickel compounds could act as co-mutagens interfering with DNA-repair processes and that the in vivo comet assay is a sensitive and effective method for detecting the DNA damage induced by NiSO4 in haemocytes of D. melanogaster.",

     "abstract": "The frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RETs) in the bone marrow or peripheral blood is a sensitive indicator of cytogenetic damage. While the kinetics of MN-RET induction in rodent models following irradiation has been investigated and reported, information about MN-RET induction of human bone marrow after radiation exposure is sparse. In this report, we describe a human long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC), established in three-dimensional (3D) bioreactors, which sustains long-term erythropoiesis. Using this system, we measured the kinetics of human bone marrow red blood cell (RBC) and reticulocyte (RET) production, as well as the kinetics of human MN-RET induction following radiation exposure up to 6\u00a0Gy. Human bone marrow established in the 3D bioreactor demonstrated an average percentage of RBCs among total viable cells peaking at 21% on day 21. The average percentage of RETs among total viable cells reached a maximum of 11% on day 14, and remained above 5% by day 28, suggesting that terminal erythroid differentiation was still active. Time- and dose-dependent induction of MN-RET by gamma radiation was observed in the human 3D LTBMC, with peak values occurring at approximately 3 days following 1\u00a0Gy irradiation. A trend towards delayed peak to 3\u20135 days post-radiation was observed with radiation doses \u22652\u00a0Gy. Our data reveal valuable information on the kinetics of radiation-induced MN-RET of human bone marrow cultured in the 3D bioreactor, a synthetic bioculture system, and suggest that this model may serve as a promising tool for studying MN-RET formation in human bone marrow, thereby providing opportunities to study bone marrow genotoxicity testing, mitigating agent effects, and other conditions that are not ordinarily feasible to experimental manipulation in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Radiation-induced amplification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be a sensing mechanism for activation of signaling cascades that influence cell fate. However, the regulated intrinsic mechanisms and targets of low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR) are still unclear. Accordingly, we investigated the effects of LDIR on NF\u03baB signal transduction and manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) activity in mice brain and gut. LDIR resulted in both dose-dependent and persistent NF\u03baB activation in gut and brain. QPCR displayed a dose- and tissue-dependent differential modulation of 88 signaling molecules. With stringent criteria, a total of 15 (2\u00a0cGy), 43 (10\u00a0cGy) and 19 (50\u00a0cGy) genes were found to be commonly upregulated between brain and gut. SOD2 immunostaining showed a LDIR-dose dependent increase. Consistent with the NF\u03baB results, we observed a persistent increase in SOD2 activity after LDIR. Moreover, muting of LDIR-induced NF\u03baB attenuated SOD2 transactivation and cellular localization. These results imply that exposure of healthy tissues to LDIR results in induced NF\u03baB and SOD2 activity and transcriptional activation of NF\u03baB-signal transduction/target molecules. More importantly, the results suggest that NF\u03baB initiates a feedback response through transcriptional activation of SOD2 that may play a key role in the LDIR-induced oxidative stress response and may control the switch that directs cell fate.",

The potential genotoxicity of dietary iron has been seldom studied in human leukocyte and only few reports have investigated in human colon tumor cells. Therefore, DNA damage and repair capacity of human leukocytes were examined using comet assay for screening the potential toxicity of various iron-overloads such as ferric-nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA), FeSO4, hemoglobin and myoglobin, and compared with 200\u00a0\u03bcM of H2O2 and HNE. The iron-overloads tested were not cytotoxic in the range of 10\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcM by trypan blue exclusion assay. The exposure of leukocytes to Fe-NTA (500 and 1000\u00a0\u03bcM), FeSO4 (250\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcM), hemoglobin (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and myoglobin (250\u00a0\u03bcM) for 30\u00a0min induced significantly higher DNA damage than NC. Treatment with 500 and 1000\u00a0\u03bcM of Fe-NTA showed a similar genotoxic effect to H2O2, and a significant higher genotoxic effect than HNE. The genotoxicity of FeSO4 (250\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcM), hemoglobin (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and myoglobin (250\u00a0\u03bcM) was not significantly different from that of H2O2 and HNE. Iron-overloads generated DNA strand break were rejoined from the first 1\u00a0h. Their genotoxic effect was not observed at 24\u00a0h.

     "abstract": "Several lines of evidence suggest an association between oxidative DNA-damage repair capacity and cancer risk. In particular, a DNA-glycosylase assay for removal of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) has been successfully applied to identify populations with increased risk for lung cancer and squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck. In order to verify whether EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) are a suitable surrogate for PBMC in specific DNA-repair phenotypic assays, a validation trial was conducted. PBMC from 20 healthy subjects were collected and an aliquot was transformed with EBV to obtain LCL. The ability of cell-free extracts from both cell types to incise a 3\u2032-fluorescently labelled duplex oligonucleotide containing a single 8-oxoG (OGG assay) was evaluated. Since this activity is mediated predominantly by OGG1, the OGG1 gene expression was also measured. 8-oxoG DNA-glycosylase activity and OGG1 expression were significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in LCL than in PBMC. However, while this assay was shown to be robust and reproducible when used on PBMC (intra-assay CV\u00a0=\u00a08%), a high intra-culture variability was observed with LCL (intra-culture CV\u00a0=\u00a016.8%). Neither differences on OGG1 gene expression nor the cell-cycle distribution seemed to account for this variability. Inter-individual variability of OGG activity in PBMC and LCL was not associated with OGG1 gene expression. We have therefore established a non-radioactive cleavage assay that can be easily applied to measure OGG activity in human PBMC. The use of LCL for DNA-repair genotype\u2013phenotype correlation studies seems to be inappropriate, at least with cell-free based functional assays.",

On the other hand, epidemiological findings suggest that foods rich in fruits and vegetables can protect against cancer. In the present study three teas, two wines, and the juices of 15 fruits and 11 vegetables were investigated for their protective effect against the genotoxic effects of 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). To closely mimic the enzymatic activation of these HAAs in humans, genetically engineered V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts were employed that express human cytochrome P450-dependent monooxygenase (hCYP) 1A2 (responsible for the first step of enzymatic activation) and human N(O)-acetyltransferase (hNAT) 2*4 or human sulfotransferase (hSULT)1A1*1 (responsible for the second step of enzymatic activation): V79-hCYP1A2-hNAT2*4 for IQ activation and V79-hCYP1A2-hSULT1A1*1 for PhIP activation. HAA genotoxicity was determined by use of the comet assay. Black, green and rooibos tea moderately reduced the genotoxicity of IQ (IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.8\u20130.9%), whereas red and white wine were less active. From the fruit juices, sweet cherry juice exhibited the highest inhibitory effect on IQ genotoxicity (IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.17%), followed by juices from kiwi fruit, plum and blueberry (IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.48\u20130.71%). The juices from watermelon, blackberry, strawberry, black currant, and Red delicious apple showed moderate suppression, whereas sour cherry, grapefruit, red currant, and pineapple juices were only weakly active. Granny Smith apple juice and orange juice proved inactive. Of the vegetable juices, strong inhibition of IQ genotoxicity was only seen with spinach and onion juices (IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.42\u20130.54%). Broccoli, cauliflower, beetroot, sweet pepper, tomato, chard, and red-cabbage juices suppressed IQ genotoxicity only moderately, whereas cucumber juice was ineffective. In most cases, fruits and vegetables inhibited PhIP genotoxicity less strongly than IQ genotoxicity. As one possible mechanism of antigenotoxicity, the inhibition of activating enzymes was studied either indirectly with diagnostic substrates or directly by measuring CYP1A2 inhibition. Only sour cherry, blueberry, and black currant juices suppressed the first step of HAA enzymatic activation, whereas most plant-derived beverages inhibited the second step.",

Frequencies of stable aberrations were calculated as incident aberrations per 100 cell equivalents scored, and examined for association with airborne PAHs.Aberrations in chromosome 6 occurred more frequently than predicted by genomic content (p\u00a0<\u00a00.008). Levels of both prenatal airborne PAHs and stable aberration frequency in chromosomes 1\u20136 decreased to half the levels reported previously in the same cohort (mean PAH decreased from 3.6 to 1.8\u00a0ng/m3; mean stable aberration frequency from 0.56 to 0.24, SD\u00a0=\u00a00.19).

The correlation between these two assays was validated using a potent germ cell toxicant, doxorubicin, in male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. Doxorubicin was administered intra-peritonially at the doses of 1.25, 2.5 and 5\u00a0mg/kg weekly once for a period of 5 weeks and all the animals were sacrificed after 1 week of receiving the last dose. The germ cell toxicity of doxorubicin was assessed using oxidative stress parameters, sperm head morphology, sperm comet assay, halo assay and histology in testes as the end point of evaluation. A significant increase in the % abnormality in sperm head was found in the animals treated with 2.5 and 5\u00a0mg/kg/week doxorubicin. Doxorubicin treatment significantly increased the DNA damage of sperm in a dose-dependent manner as observed by sperm comet assay parameters. A strong positive correlation was observed between the sperm head morphological evaluation and the sperm comet assay. Therefore, it can be concluded that the damage in genetic material of sperm may result into abnormalities in the sperm head morphology. The sperm head morphological evaluation is considered to be essential for the assessment of male germ cell toxicity by several regulatory bodies like the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH). However, acceptance of the sperm comet assay by regulatory authorities as a standard genotoxicity test for assessing male germ cell toxicity still requires further validation of the assay.",

The method identified uses the erythrocyte pure fraction from cellulose filtered bone marrow with slight modifications to the widely published MicroFlow\u00ae method developed by Litron Laboratories, Rochester, NY for the detection of micronuclei in peripheral blood. A number of experiments were conducted to compare the micronucleus induction measured by flow cytometry with traditional microscopic analysis in male rats treated daily for 2 days with appropriate vehicle controls or various doses of cyclophosphamide (CP), mitomycin C (MMC), vinblastine sulfate (VBS), 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), etoposide (ETO), colchicine (COL), or 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO). In addition, for a subset of chemical we compared the induction of micronuclei in bone marrow and peripheral blood. The results from this study showed a very good correlation of micronucleus frequencies in bone marrow between microscopic analysis and the flow cytometry as well as between blood and bone marrow. In general, micronucleus frequencies of test compound treated animals and inter-animal variability were slightly lower by flow cytometric analysis compared to manual slide analysis. The data presented in this study support the use of the CD71 flow method for the analysis of micronuclei in rat bone marrow and also suggest that peripheral blood may be equally as sensitive as bone marrow in detecting a micronucleus response in short term studies.",

     "abstract": "The impact of popular weight-loss diets with different macronutrient profiles on bowel health in humans has not been previously assessed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a high-protein/high red meat (HP) diet influences faecal water genotoxicity and other standard biomarkers of bowel health differently compared with a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet. Thirty-three male subjects were randomly assigned to a HP (35% protein, 40% carbohydrate) or HC (17% protein, 58% carbohydrate) isocaloric energy-restricted dietary intervention consisting of 12 weeks intensive weight loss followed by weight maintenance for up to 52 weeks. Faecal samples were collected at 0, 12 and 52 weeks. Faecal water genotoxicity was assessed in the WIL2-NS human B lymphoblastoid cell line by means of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus cytome assay. Average weight loss after 12 weeks was 9.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0kg for both diets, with no further change in weight at 52 weeks. Two-way ANOVA showed a significant effect with time (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) but not diet for total DNA damage, with a reduction in genotoxicity after 12 weeks intensive weight loss, and a subsequent increase after 9 months weight maintenance to levels not significantly different from baseline. There was no significant effect for time or diet on faecal pH, short-chain fatty acid excretion, phenol or p-cresol. Results suggest that HP and HC weight-loss diets may modify the carcinogenic profile of the bowel contents such that weight loss may exert a beneficial effect by reducing genotoxic load in the short term; however, these results require verification against a non-weight-loss control.",

     "abstract": "Olive oil is an important source of mono-unsaturated fat and a prime component of the Mediterranean diet. The beneficial health effects of olive oil are due to both its high content of mono-unsaturated fatty acids and its high content of anti-oxidative substances.The objective of this study was to investigate the basis for the epidemiological information relating to the health benefits associated with the consumption of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO). For this purpose, the somatic mutation and recombination test (SMART) in wings of Drosophila melanogaster was applied to evaluate the antigenotoxic activity of six different EVOOs from four Spanish varieties (Hojiblanca, Nevadillo, Casta de Cabra, Picual). A two-level approach was followed: (1) determination of the lack of genotoxicity along with the antigenotoxic activity of EVOOs, through antigenotoxicity assays, with hydrogen peroxide as an oxidative genotoxin, and (2) evaluation of the properties of three major distinctive components of EVOOs that could be responsible for their antigenotoxic activity. The EVOOs tested are shown to be non-genotoxic; they exhibited antigenotoxic activity against the effects of hydrogen peroxide. Triolein, tyrosol and squalene did not show genotoxic effects in the proliferative imaginal cells of D. melanogaster. The three components were antigenotoxic when combined with soybean oil, only triolein and tyrosol showed a clear desmutagenic effect when combined with hydrogen peroxide. Our results confirm the safety of EVOOs and their health-protective effects.",

There is an increasing incidence of breast cancer and eminent use of tobacco in females in this region. Thus, we analysed the role of tobacco exposure and polymorphisms in detoxification enzymes in breast cancer risk. Polymorphisms in five gene variants (GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTP1, TP53 and CYP17) and four environmental exposure variables (tobacco smoking, tobacco chewing, betel quid chewing, alcohol) were analysed in 117 breast cancer cases and 174 cancer free controls. Multifactor dimensionality reduction identified betel quid chewing as the single main risk factor and women with betel quid chewing history had five times the risk of developing breast cancer [4.78 (2.87\u20138.00) 0.001]. In logistic regression analysis, GSTT1 null and GSTM1 null genotypes conferred 41% less [0.59 (0.34\u20131.03) 0.06] and 55% less [0.58 (0.30\u20131.02) 0.05] reduced risk to breast cancer, respectively. However, the risk increased in women with GSTP1 variant G allele which conferred 1.43 times [(0.96\u20132.11) 0.07] more risk to breast cancer. In conclusion this study suggests betel quid chewing as a significant risk factor for developing breast cancer. Moreover, the lack of detoxification enzymes GSTT1 and GSTM1 are associated with reduced breast cancer risk.",

     "abstract": "Lymphocytes are more sensitive to radiation in vivo than in vitro. However, the mechanism of this differential response is poorly understood. In the present study, it was found that the lipid peroxidation and cell death were significantly higher in lymphocytes following whole body irradiation (WBI) as compared to lymphocytes exposed to radiation in vitro. EL-4 cells transplanted in mice were also more sensitive to radiation than EL-4 cells irradiated in vitro. DNA repair, as assessed by comet assay, was significantly faster in lymphocytes exposed to 4\u00a0Gy radiation in vitro as compared to that in lymphocytes obtained from whole body irradiated mice exposed to the same dose of radiation. This was associated with increased NF-\u03baB activation in response to genotoxic stress and lesser activation of caspase in lymphocytes in vitro compared to in vivo. To explain the differential radiosensitivity, we postulated a role of nitric oxide, an extrinsic diffusible mediator of radiosensitivity that has also been implicated in DNA repair inhibition. Nitric oxide levels were significantly elevated in the plasma of whole body irradiated mice but not in the supernatant of cells irradiated in vitro. Addition of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a nitric oxide donor to cells irradiated in vitro inhibited the repair of DNA damage and enhanced apoptosis (increased Bax to Bcl-2 ratio). Administration of l-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, to mice significantly protected lymphocytes against WBI-induced DNA damage and inhibited in vivo radiation-induced production of nitric oxide. These results confirm that the observed differential radiosensitivity of lymphocytes was due to slow repair of DNA due to nitric oxide production in vivo.",

The newly identified MTAE and AMTP possessed antimutagenic activity as determined by their ability to inhibit the UV-induced mutation in repair-proficient E. coli B/r WP2. MTAE and MTPE (esters with thiocarbonic acid and alkyl alcohol) induced the differentiation of human colon cancer cells (RCM-1 cells), but AMTE and AMTP (esters with carbonic acid and thioalkyl alcohol) did not. A specific thioester motif containing a thiocarbonic acid and alkyl alcohol correlated with these compounds ability to induce differentiation. AMTE, MTPE, AMTP, and eugenol had higher oxygen radical absorbing capacity than the antioxidative vitamin, ascorbic acid.

Earlier studies from our laboratory had demonstrated an increase in post-implantation embryo loss following tamoxifen treatment to adult male rats at a dose of 0.4\u00a0mg/kg/day for 60 days. The post-implantation loss occurred at around 9\u201310 days of gestation suggesting that paternal factors involved in embryo development were affected by tamoxifen treatment. The present study was done to determine if any chromosomal aberrations occurred in the embryos sired by tamoxifen treated male rats. Chromosomal aberrations induced by tamoxifen treatment to adult male rats in the bone marrow (F0 males) and in the embryos sired by these males (F1 progeny) were determined. In addition, the reproductive performance of the F1 progeny was assessed. A significant dose dependent reduction in mitotic activity in the bone marrow and embryonic cells was observed after tamoxifen treatment. In addition, tamoxifen also induced a significant dose dependent increase in the frequency of chromosomal aberrations, mainly gaps and breaks in bone marrow and embryonic cells. However, the embryos sired by the tamoxifen treated males had no effect on developmental milestones achieved and on their reproductive performance. The present study suggests that chromosomal aberrations observed in the embryos did not the affect their development until adulthood but could make the progeny of the tamoxifen treated males vulnerable to the development of adult onset diseases later in life.",

In particular, new experimental designs become possible when automated scoring is combined with treatment, processing and sampling that all occur in microtiter plates. To test this premise, experiments described herein investigated micronucleus (MN) formation in TK6 cells treated with genotoxic agents applied at 22 closely spaced concentrations in quadruplicate, with 10,000 cells analyzed per replicate. The genotoxicants colchicine, vinblastine sulfate, ethyl methanesulfonate, methyl methanesulfonate, ethyl nitrosourea, methyl nitrosourea, and bleomycin were applied continuously for 24\u201330\u00a0h. Following treatment, all cell processing, sampling and data acquisition steps were accomplished in the same 96-well plate. Data acquisition occurred in a walk-away mode via the use of a high throughput sampling device. The resulting flow cytometric MN values were evaluated with a statistical model that indicated non-linear relationships describe the data better than linear fits. The one exception was bleomycin, where MN induction was consistently best described by a linear dose\u2013response relationship. Collectively, these results suggest that flow cytometry represents a practical and efficient approach for thoroughly examining the dose\u2013response relationship, and clearly benefits studies that seek to characterize no observable genotoxic effect levels, lowest observable genotoxic effect levels, and/or benchmark doses.",

The present work evaluated the efficiency of conventional chlorination to remove the genotoxicity/mutagenicity of the azo dyes Disperse Red 1, Disperse Orange 1, and Disperse Red 13 from aqueous solutions. The comet and micronucleus assays with HepG2 cells and the Salmonella mutagenicity assay were used. The degradation of the dye molecules after the same treatment was also evaluated, using ultraviolet and visible absorption spectrum measurements (UV\u2013vis), high performance liquid chromatography coupled to a diode-array detector (HPLC-DAD), and total organic carbon removal (TOC) analysis. The comet assay showed that the three dyes studied induced damage in the DNA of the HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. After chlorination, these dyes remained genotoxic, although with a lower damage index (DI). The micronucleus test showed that the mutagenic activity of the dyes investigated was completely removed by chlorination, under the conditions tested. The Salmonella assay showed that chlorination reduced the mutagenicity of all three dyes in strain YG1041, but increased the mutagenicity of Disperse Red 1 and Disperse Orange 1 in strain TA98. With respect to chemical analysis, all the solutions showed rapid discoloration and a reduction in the absorbance bands characteristic of the chromophore group of each dye. However, the TOC was not completely removed, showing that chlorination of these dyes is not efficient in mineralizing them. It was concluded that conventional chlorination should be used with caution for the treatment of aqueous samples contaminated with azo dyes.",

     "abstract": "Deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) are the precursors used by DNA polymerases for replication and repair of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in animal cells. Accurate DNA synthesis requires adequate amounts of each dNTP and appropriately balanced dNTP pools. Total cellular pool sizes are in the range of 10\u2013100\u00a0pmoles of each dNTP/million cells during S phase, with mitochondrial pools representing at most 10% of the total. In quiescent or differentiated cells pools are about 10-fold lower both in the cytosol and mitochondria. Contrary to what may be expected on the basis of the roughly equimolar abundance of the 4 nitrogen bases in DNA, the four dNTPs are present in the pools in different ratios, with pyrimidines often exceeding purines. Individual cell lines may exhibit different pool compositions even if they are derived from the same animal species. It has been known for several decades that imbalance of dNTP pools has mutagenic and cytotoxic effects, and leads to \u201cmutator\u201d phenotypes characterized by increased mutation frequencies. Until 10 years ago this phenomenon was considered to affect exclusively the nuclear genome. With the discovery that thymidine phosphorylase deficiency causes destabilization of mitochondrial DNA and a severe multisystemic syndrome the importance of dNTP pool balance was extended to mitochondria. Following that first discovery, mutations in other genes coding for mitochondrial or cytosolic enzymes of dNTP metabolism have been associated with mitochondrial DNA depletion syndromes. Both excess and deficiency of one dNTP may be detrimental.We study the mechanisms that in mammalian cells keep the dNTP pools in balance, and are particularly interested in the enzymes that, similar to thymidine phosphorylase, contribute to pool regulation by degrading dNTP precursors. The role of some relevant enzymes is illustrated with data obtained by chemical or genetic manipulation of their expression in cultured mammalian cells.",

     "abstract": "An aerobic environment burdens DNA polymerase substrates with oxidized substrates (DNA and nucleotide pools). A major promutagenic lesion resulting from oxidative stress is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxoG). Guanine oxidation alters the hydrogen bonding properties of the base and glycosidic-preference of the nucleotide. The favored glycosidic syn-conformation exposes the Hoogsteen edge of the base for hydrogen bonding with adenine during DNA synthesis. The cell has recognized the threat of this lesion and has evolved an intricate surveillance system to provide DNA polymerases with unmodified substrates. Failure to do so leads to transversion mutations. Since the mutagenic properties of the base are dictated by the anti\u2013syn-conformation of the nucleotide, the molecular interactions of 8-oxoG in the confines of the DNA polymerase active site are expected to influence its coding potential. Recent structural characterization of DNA polymerases from several families with this lesion in the nascent base pair binding pocket has provided insight to the mutagenic properties of this modified nucleotide. These structures reveal that flexibility around the template-binding pocket can permit 8-oxoG to assume an anti- or syn-conformation and code for cytosine or adenine incorporation, respectively. In contrast, the binding pocket for the incoming nucleotide does not have this flexibility so that 8-oxodGTP insertion opposite cytosine is strongly discouraged.",

     "abstract": "Genetic information must be duplicated with precision and accurately passed on to daughter cells and later generations. In order to achieve this goal, DNA polymerases (Pols) have to faithfully execute DNA synthesis during chromosome replication and repair. However, the conditions under which Pols synthesize DNA are not always optimal; the template DNA can be damaged by various endogenous and exogenous genotoxic agents including reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ROS oxidize dNTPs in the nucleotide pool from which Pols elongate DNA strands. Both damaged DNA and oxidized dNTPs interfere with faithful DNA synthesis by Pols, inducing various cellular abnormalities, such as mutations, cancer, neurological diseases, and cellular senescence. In this review, we focus on the process by which Pols incorporate oxidized dNTPs into DNA and compare the properties of Pols: efficiency, i.e., kcat/Km, kpol/Kd or Vmax/Km, and template base preference for the incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP, an oxidized form of dGTP. In general, Pols involved in chromosome replication, the A- and B-family Pols, are resistant to the incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP, whereas Pols involved in repair and/or translesion synthesis, the X- and Y-family Pols, incorporate nucleotides in a relatively efficient manner and tend to incorporate it opposite template dA rather than template dC, though there are several exceptions. We discuss the molecular mechanisms by which Pols exhibit different template base preferences for the incorporation of 8-oxo-dGTP and how Pols are involved in the induction of mutations via the incorporation of oxidized nucleotides under oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "To identify novel nucleotide pool sanitizing enzymes, we have established a comprehensive screening system for damaged nucleotide-binding proteins based on proteomics technology. In the screening system, affinity chromatography with resins carrying various damaged nucleotides is used for the purification of binding proteins, and the purified proteins are identified by mass-spectrometry. Inosine triphosphate (ITP) is a deleterious damaged nucleotide, and can be generated by nitrosative deamination of ATP or phosphorylation of inosine monophosphate (IMP). Using the above system, we performed screens for ITP-binding proteins from mouse and human cell extracts, and identified several ITP-binding enzymes. We identified both mouse inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) and human ITPA, well-known ITP hydrolyzing enzymes, as ITP-binding proteins. These results support the validity of this screening system. In addition to ITPA, we identified human nucleoside diphosphate linked moiety X-type motif 16 (NUDT16) protein as an ITP-binding protein. Biochemical analysis revealed that NUDT16 selectively hydrolyzes deoxyinosine diphosphate (dIDP) and IDP to deoxyinosine monophosphate (dIMP) and IMP, respectively. dITP and ITP are also hydrolyzed by NUDT16 to a lesser extent. The knockdown of NUDT16 in HeLa MR cells suppressed cell proliferation, and was accompanied by a significantly increased accumulation of strand breaks in nuclear DNA, suggesting that NUDT16 has an essential role in the maintenance of genome stability. RS21-C6, another ITP-binding protein identified in our screen, binds not only to ITP, but also to ATP. RS21-C6 hydrolyzes dCTP and 5-halo-dCTP, but does not hydrolyze ITP or ATP. It is likely that RS21-C6 may control dCTP levels or eliminate 5-halo-dCTP in the nucleotide pools. In conclusion, the results of these studies show that our screening system is applicable in studying the health effects of damaged nucleotides and cellular sanitizing systems for nucleotide pools.",

In mammals, this enzyme is encoded by the Itpa gene. Using the Itpa gene-disrupted mouse as a model, we have elucidated the biological significance of the ITPA protein and its substrates, ITP and dITP. Itpa\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited peri- or post-natal lethality dependent on the genetic background. The heart of the Itpa\u2212/\u2212 mouse was found to be structurally and functionally abnormal. Significantly higher levels of deoxyinosine and inosine were detected in nuclear DNA and RNA prepared from Itpa\u2212/\u2212 embryos compared to wild type embryos. In addition, an accumulation of ITP was observed in the erythrocytes of Itpa\u2212/\u2212 mice. We found that Itpa\u2212/\u2212 primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), which have no detectable ability to generate IMP from ITP in whole cell extracts, exhibited a prolonged population-doubling time, increased chromosome abnormalities and accumulation of single-strand breaks in their nuclear DNA, in comparison to primary MEFs prepared from wild type embryos. These results revealed that (1) ITP and dITP are spontaneously produced in vivo and (2) accumulation of ITP and dITP is responsible for the harmful effects observed in the Itpa\u2212/\u2212 mouse. In addition to its effect as the precursor nucleotide for RNA transcription, ITP has the potential to influence the activity of ATP/GTP-binding proteins.

     "abstract": "More and more convincing data link bacteria to the development of cancers. How bacteria act as mutagens by altering host genomes, what are the different strategies they develop and what consequences do they have on infection-associated pathogenesis are the main questions addressed in this review, which focuses in particular on Helicobacter pylori infection. H. pylori is a major risk factor for gastric cancer development. Its oncogenic role is mediated by the chronic active inflammation it elicits in the gastric mucosa, associated with its capacity to persistently colonize the human stomach. However, direct genotoxicity of H. pylori through the action of bacterial cytotoxin or resulting from a DNA damaging effect of its metabolic derivatives as nitroso compounds cannot be excluded. Numerous studies have investigated inflammation-associated DNA damaging activity and mutagenic response due to H. pylori infection in both human and animal models. Recent findings on its mutagenic effects at the nuclear and mitochondrial genome and related DNA damage are reviewed. This genotoxic activity associated with oxidative species produced during inflammation is linked to the decreased efficiency of DNA repair systems. DNA methylation, which plays an important role in the regulation of the host response to H. pylori infection, is also documented. Furthermore, H. pylori affects genome integrity by increasing activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), a DNA/RNA editing cytidine deaminase linking mutagenesis and tumorigenesis. These different strategies occurring during bacteria\u2013host cell interaction, lead to nucleotide modifications and genome instabilities recognized as early events in the carcinogenesis process and contribute to the oncogenic properties of H. pylori infection.",

     "abstract": "Activation of persistent DNA damage response (DDR) signaling is associated with the induction of a permanent proliferative arrest known as cellular senescence, a phenomenon intrinsically linked to both tissue aging as well as tumor suppression. The DNA damage observed in senescent cells has been attributed to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), failing DNA damage repair processes, and/or oncogenic activation. It is not clear how labile molecules such as ROS are able to damage chromatin-bound DNA to a sufficient extent to invoke persistent DNA damage and DDR signaling. Recent evidence suggests that the nucleotide pool is a significant target for oxidants and that oxidized nucleotides, once incorporated into genomic DNA, can lead to the induction of a DNA strand break-associated DDR that triggers senescence in normal cells and in cells sustaining oncogene activation. Evasion of this DDR and resulting senescence is a key step in tumor progression. This review will explore the role of oxidation in the nucleotide pool as a major effector of oxidative stress-induced genotoxic damage and DDR in the context of cellular senescence and tumorigenic transformation.",

Currently, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is working towards a final version of the guideline for the conduct of the in vitro mammalian cell micronucleus Test (MNvit). A few questions regarding appropriate cytotoxicity measurements and cytotoxicity limits to use remain to be answered. In order to resolve the remaining questions, we compared the induction of micronuclei at the top dose (50\u201360% cytotoxicity) determined by either Relative Cell Counts (RCC), Relative Increase in Cell Counts (RICC), Relative Population Doublings (RPD), or Cytokinesis-Blocked Proliferating Index (CBPI) using weak and strong inducers of micronuclei in both the presence and absence of cytochalasin B (CYB) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) and human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells. In order to assess extensive dose\u2013response relationships, we selected expected weak (diazepam, phenolphthalein, quinacrine dihydrochloride dihydrate) and strong (cytosine arabinoside, mitomycin C, vinblastine sulphate) inducers of micronuclei with a variety of different mechanisms of action for testing. The results clearly demonstrated that all six compounds produced positive responses using either cytotoxicity measurement.

CYP was orally intubated in a single treatment (1/2 LD50) or in repeated treatments (1/5 LD50 daily, for 5 successive days), either alone, or concomitantly with repeated oral intubations (5 successive days) of each individual putative protector, or with their combination (GRE or/and VTC).

The groups received nothing, a single dose or repeated treatments with insecticide alone, or associated with putative natural elements, separately or in combinations. Animals were sacrificed at their scheduled times and their femoral bone-marrows were flushed out to be utilized in the micronucleus test and metaphase chromosomal aberration assay. The results show that CYP administration significantly induced clastogenic effects, as revealed by the significant increase in the mean frequencies of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes and various structural chromosomal aberrations in bone-marrow metaphase cells of all groups of treated rats. On the other hand, this investigation clearly revealed the protective role of GRE and VTC, either each alone or in combination, against the mutagenic potential of cypermethrin: the garlic extract was often more efficient in its protective action against the insecticide toxicity than vitamin C. while the combination of both natural elements produced, in most cases, a more pronounced protective effect than when each was administered alone.",

We genotyped DNA from 1186 melanoma patients and 1280 healthy controls for 13 different polymorphisms in eight DNA-repair genes.

Carriers of the variant alleles were associated with a decreased risk (OR 0.83; 95% CI, 0.79\u20130.98). Three additional polymorphisms together with T241M XRCC3 that tagged the entire gene region and the neighbouring genes KLC1, ZFYVE21 and PPP1R13B were not associated with the disease risk; neither were the inferred haplotypes. Imputation showed association of comparable magnitude with 11 non-genotyped neighbouring polymorphisms. Finally, the combination of results for all polymorphisms genotyped in the present study with published data suggests that none of the investigated polymorphisms was associated with melanoma susceptibility.

The results demonstrate that both Swedish and Icelandic herring gulls are exposed to genotoxic pollution. Urban specimens have higher levels of DNA adducts than rural specimens, but background exposure to genotoxic environmental pollutants, such as PAHs, is also significant. In the herring gull the general level of DNA adducts in the liver seems to be higher than in fish. DNA adducts were most abundant in the liver, followed by the kidney, intestinal mucosa, and whole blood, in decreasing order. The frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes was probably slightly elevated in all the investigated sites, reflecting a significant background exposure. The level of DNA adducts was unrelated to the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes, and both these variables were unrelated to symptoms of thiamine deficiency. The investigation confirmed the utility of DNA adducts, and probably also micronucleated erythrocytes, as biomarkers of genotoxicity in birds.",

     "abstract": "A collaborative trial was conducted to evaluate the possibility of integrating the rat-liver Comet assay into repeat-dose toxicity studies. Fourteen laboratories from Europe, Japan and the USA tested fifteen chemicals. Two chemicals had been previously shown to induce micronuclei in an acute protocol, but were found negative in a 4-week Micronucleus (MN) Assay (benzo[a]pyrene and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine; Hamada et al., 2001); four genotoxic rat-liver carcinogens that were negative in the MN assay in bone marrow or blood (2,6-dinitrotoluene, dimethylnitrosamine, 1,2-dibromomethane, and 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline); three compounds used in the ongoing JaCVAM (Japanese Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods) validation study of the acute liver Comet assay (2,4-diaminotoluene, 2,6-diaminotoluene and acrylamide); three pharmaceutical-like compounds (chlordiazepoxide, pyrimethamine and gemifloxacin), and three non-genotoxic rodent liver carcinogens (methapyrilene, clofibrate and phenobarbital).Male rats received oral administrations of the test compounds, daily for two or four weeks. The top dose was meant to be the highest dose producing clinical signs or histopathological effects without causing mortality, i.e. the 28-day maximum tolerated dose. The liver Comet assay was performed according to published recommendations and following the protocol for the ongoing JaCVAM validation trial.Laboratories provided liver Comet assay data obtained at the end of the long-term (2- or 4-week) studies together with an evaluation of liver histology. Most of the test compounds were also investigated in the liver Comet assay after short-term (1\u20133 daily) administration to compare the sensitivity of the two study designs. MN analyses were conducted in bone marrow or peripheral blood for most of the compounds to determine whether the liver Comet assay could complement the MN assay for the detection of genotoxins after long-term treatment.Most of the liver genotoxins were positive and the three non-genotoxic carcinogens gave negative result in the liver Comet assay after long-term administration. There was a high concordance between short- and long-term Comet assay results. Most compounds when tested up to the maximum tolerated dose were correctly detected in both short- and long-term studies. Discrepant results were obtained with 2,6 diaminotoluene (negative in the short-term, but positive in the long-term study), phenobarbital (positive in the short-term, but negative in the long-term study) and gemifloxacin (positive in the short-term, but negative in the long-term study). The overall results indicate that the liver Comet assay can be integrated within repeat-dose toxicity studies and efficiently complements the MN assay in detecting genotoxins.Practical aspects of integrating genotoxicity endpoints into repeat-dose studies were evaluated, e.g. by investigating the effect of blood sampling, as typically performed during toxicity studies, on the Comet and MN assays. The bleeding protocols used here did not affect the conclusions of the Comet assay or of the MN assays in blood and bone marrow. Although bleeding generally increased reticulocyte frequencies, the sensitivity of the response in the MN assay was not altered. These findings indicate that all animals in a toxicity study (main-study animals as well as toxicokinetic (TK) satellite animals) could be used for evaluating genotoxicity. However, possible logistical issues with scheduling of the necropsies and the need to conduct electrophoresis promptly after tissue sampling suggest that the use of TK animals could be simpler. The data so far do not indicate that liver proliferation or toxicity confound the results of the liver Comet assay. As was also true for other genotoxicity assays, criteria for evaluation of Comet assay results and statistical analyses differed among laboratories. Whereas comprehensive advice on statistical analysis is available in the literature, agreement is needed on applying consistent criteria.",

In this study, we found the ultraviolet B (UVB) region of SSL to produce photomodified BaP with high cytotoxicity and the ability to generate \u03b3-H2AX. Degradation of BaP by SSL, resulting in an increase in cytotoxicity and the generation of \u03b3-H2AX, was decreased by UVB-masking using a glass plate. Exposure to UVB itself increased the cytotoxicity of BaP and amount of \u03b3-H2AX generated. Other PAHs, 1,2-benzoanthracene and 1,2:5,6-dibenzoanthracene, which absorb UVB, also showed enhanced cytotoxicity and the promoted the generation of \u03b3-H2AX after exposure to SSL, whereas naphthalene and chrysene, which have low absorption in the UVB region, did not. These findings suggested that UVB is important for the degradation of PAHs having absorbance in this region, but that the production of genotoxic intermediates during the degradation process needs to be considered. UVB is a two-edged blade in environments, effectively degrading toxic chemicals but also producing genotoxic compounds as reactive intermediates.",

The atmospheric environment receives diverse chemical substances, including genotoxic agents that may affect human health. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the atmospheric quality in two urban areas in Rio Grande do Sul State (Brazil), under the influence of greater (Site 1) or lesser (Site 2) anthropogenic sources. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of environmental interest were quantified and the Salmonella/microsome assay was used for the measurement of mutagenicity. Organic compounds extracted from the airborne particulate matter were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to detect PAHs of interest (known or possible carcinogens). The organic extracts were also tested for mutagenic and cytotoxic activity in the Salmonella/microsome assay with strains TA98, TA100, YG1021 and YG1024, with or without S9 activation. At Site 1, benzo[ghi]perylene (BghiP) and indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IP) were found at higher concentrations and mutagenicity (revertants per \u03bcg extract) varied from 1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 (TA98, no S9) to 5.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45 (TA98, S9). At Site 2, BghiP and IP were present in larger amounts and the mutagenic responses ranged from 0.6 to 3.7 revertants per \u03bcg (both in TA98, S9). The occurrence of BghiP and IP may be related to vehicular emissions. These and the other PAHs studied, as well as the nitro compounds, may contribute to the mutagenicity found in these airborne particles.",

The objective of this study was to provide further insight into the toxicological profile of this compound, because of the current discrepancy in the literature with regard to the safety of parabens.The Vero cell line, derived from the kidney of the green monkey, was selected to evaluate the adverse effects of propylparaben by use of a set of mechanistically relevant endpoints for detecting cytotoxicity and genotoxic activities. Our results demonstrate that exposure to the compound for 24\u00a0h causes changes in cell-proliferation rates rather than in cell viability. A significant and dose-dependent decline in the percentage of mitotic cells was observed at the lowest concentration tested, mainly due to cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. Immunodetection techniques revealed that induction of DNA double-strand breaks and oxidative damage underlies the cytostatic effect observed in treated Vero cells. Additional studies are in progress to extend these findings, which define a novel mode of action of propylparaben in cultured mammalian cells.",

Therefore, it was concluded that the two species of Davilla possess qualitatively similar chemical profiles. In the present study, the mutagenic and genotoxic potential of these plants and of their isolated compounds was tested in the Salmonella typhimurium assay (Ames test) with strains TA100, TA98, TA102 and TA97a, in the micronucleus test with peripheral blood cells of mice treated in vivo, and in plasmid DNA to analyze DNA strand-breaks. In the assessment of mutagenic potential by the Ames test, extracts from both plant species and a D. nitida ethyl-acetate fraction induced positive responses. On the other hand, none of the extracts showed genotoxic activity in the mouse cells. In the presence of metal ion, D. nitida and D. elliptica aqueous and ethyl-acetate fractions, as well as their isolated compounds, induced single- and double-strand-breaks in plasmid DNA in a cell-free system.",

The assay has previously been reported to be capable of detecting the tumor-initiating and tumor-promoting activities of chemical carcinogens according to the different protocols, an initiation assay and a promotion assay, respectively. We applied this short-term assay to 98 chemicals to characterize the assay and evaluate its performance for the detection of chemical carcinogenicity. When the assay results were compared with the existing genotoxicity data, the Bhas 42 cell transformation assay could detect a considerable number of Ames-negative and Ames-discordant carcinogens: and the promotion assay detected most of those Ames-negative and -discordant carcinogens. This fact suggested that the Bhas 42 cells behaved as initiated cells in the transformation assay. The performance indices were calculated from the assay results of 52 carcinogens and 37 non-carcinogens. The concordance was 78%, sensitivity 73%, specificity 84%, positive predictivity 86%, negative predictivity 69%, false negative 27% and false positive 16%. Of these values, the concordance, specificity, negative predictivity and false positive were superior and the other performance indices were equivalent to those of conventional genotoxicity tests. From overall results, we concluded that the accuracy of prediction of chemical carcinogenicity would be improved by introducing the Bhas 42 cell transformation assay into the battery of in vitro assays.",

Treatment for these disorders consists of a protein-restricted diet, supplemented with synthetic formulas of amino acids, but excluding isoleucine, threonine, valine and methionine; and l-carnitine, to promote detoxication. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that lipid and protein oxidative damage may be involved in the pathophysiology of these diseases, but DNA damage has not been fully investigated. In this work, we evaluated in vitro the effects of PA and MMA, in the presence or absence of l-carnitine, on DNA damage in peripheral leukocytes, as determined by the alkaline comet assay, using silver staining and visual scoring. PA and MMA induced a DNA damage index (DI) significantly higher than that of the control group. l-Carnitine significantly reduced PA- and MMA-induced DNA damage, in a concentration-dependent manner.

The time intervals needed for attachment on the agarose-coated 96-well multi-chamber plate (MCP, specially developed for the high-throughput comet assay) differed for all adherent cell lines mentioned. V79 cells needed 6\u00a0h for attachment, fibroblasts 2\u20134\u00a0h, Hep-G2 required 18\u00a0h, and HeLa cells 16\u00a0h. After this period, chemical treatment could occur. Non-adherent lymphocytes could be treated with the chemicals directly after they had been pipetted into the wells of the MCP and centrifuged.We compared the sensitivities of these five cell types toward the directly DNA-damaging compounds methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and toward the indirectly acting agent pentachlorophenol (PCP). Except for Hep-G2 cells, exposure to PCP was conducted in the presence of an S9 microsome fraction. DNA damage, measured as an increase in the percentage of DNA in the tail region of the comets, occurred in a concentration-dependent manner. Under the test conditions used in this study, human lymphocytes were the most sensitive cells toward the three chemicals tested, fibroblasts showed a similar sensitivity toward the directly acting MMS and H2O2, but were less sensitive toward PCP.

Two filters were created with this set: the first was based on the frequency of descriptors listed in the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Medical Subject Headings Thesaurus (MeSH terms) only, the second was based on the frequency of words in titles and abstracts (text-words), besides MeSH terms.The sensitivity, specificity, precision and accuracy rates of the two filters were calculated as performance measures.Out of all 1602 published articles, 344 were found to be pertinent to cancer molecular epidemiology; these formed the gold standard set. The first filter was the most specific (99%) and showed a good precision (93.2%), the second showed a higher sensitivity (78.2%) and accuracy (91.6%).The two filters proposed here represent a balance between sensitivity and specificity. Redefinition and elaboration of more appropriate NLM MeSH terms could greatly facilitate the retrieval of studies on the molecular epidemiology of cancer.

Newborns of mothers exposed to anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are at increased risk for major congenital malformations, cognitive impairment and fetal death. Cord-blood lymphocytes of the newborns whose mothers received long-term AEDs therapy during pregnancy were used in this study. There were 37 newborns (Group A), divided into two subgroups, i.e. from mothers receiving mono-therapy (A1) and from those receiving poly-therapy (A2). The major drugs given to the pregnant women with epilepsy in mono-therapy were valproic acid (VPA) and carbamazepine (CBZ) analogues. In poly-therapy, besides VPA and CBZ derivatives also phenyltriazine, sulphanamide, benzodiazepines and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) derivatives were administered. Three kinds of in vitro cytogenetic test were applied: the chromosome aberration (CA) assay, the sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay, and the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN). In addition, the mitotic index (MI), the replication index (RI) and the nuclear division index (NDI) were determined.The mean number of CA/cell (excluding gaps) for group A did not differ statistically significantly from the negative controls (p\u00a0>\u00a00.1), nor did the mean MI value (p\u00a0>\u00a00.1). In group A, the mean number of SCE/cell was statistically significantly higher compared with the negative control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The mean RI value for group A did not demonstrate statistically significant differences (p\u00a0>\u00a00.1). The mean MN number for group A was higher than in the negative control, but this difference was on the border of statistical significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). The value of NDI for group A did not differ significantly from the value in the negative control (p\u00a0>\u00a00.1).The anti-epileptic drugs given to epileptic women in mono- and poly-therapy during pregnancy evoked potentially clastogenic and genotoxic effects in cord-blood lymphocytes.

Part of the lymphocytes was kept under liquid-holding conditions for 48\u00a0h, and then loaded onto Ficoll-Paque medium to separate apoptotic (high-density) from normal (normal-density) cells. Then all samples were examined for the same three end-points. To determine whether expression of p53 influences the telomere shortening associated with a spontaneous or radiation-induced apoptotic process, the lymphocytes were also analyzed for expression of p53 at 0 and 48\u00a0h recovery times (non-irradiated and irradiated samples) and after 2 weeks in liquid-holding conditions (non-irradiated sample).After 48\u00a0h in liquid-holding, the p53-dependent apoptotic lymphocytes in the irradiated cultures presented shortened telomeres. After a 2-week recovery time, non-irradiated cells showed a p53-dependent spontaneous apoptosis, but no telomere shortening. These results demonstrate that radiation-induced apoptosis correlates with shortened telomeres in G0 human lymphocytes. Spontaneous and radiation-induced apoptosis are dependent on expression of p53. In contrast, p53 may not play an effective role in telomere shortening, because spontaneous apoptosis did not correlate with telomere shortening. As most tumours are compromised with respect to p53 function, our findings on the role of p53 in telomere shortening may prove critical for applying therapeutic modalities in the clinic, and may facilitate the design of agents that selectively disrupt telomere integrity in tumour cells.",

Further intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility of the RSMN assay was established by testing three coded chemicals, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, cyclohexanone, and mitomycin C. All chemicals were correctly identified by all laboratories as either positive or negative.

The irritation potency of RPB smoke was studied in mice. A hexachloroethane-based smoke (HC/Zn/TNT) was used as a reference in the studies. A 5-min exposure of BEAS 2B cells to P60 smoke (1.1, 2.2 and 4.4\u00a0g/m3, measured as H3PO4) did not induce any cytotoxic effects, while RPB smoke (1.3, 2.6 and 5.1\u00a0g/m3, measured as H3PO4) caused a mild decrease in cell viability at higher concentrations, without a clear dose-dependent effect.

We detected synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the coding region sequence of p53-like cDNA from Mytilus trossulus (bay mussel) that differ between normal and neoplastic haemolymph. SNPs were located at positions 182, 392 and 821\u00a0bp. Most (94%) of the late leukemic animals sampled from cages in Burrard Inlet (British Columbia, Canada) had the same p53-like genotype, C182T G392G C821T, whereas 75% of the healthy animals were homozygous at positions C182C and T821T, independent of the genotype at the 392\u00a0bp position. As well, we detected an increased number of allelic variants in the leukemic animals that may arise from separate somatic mutation events in haemocyte precursors or from additional p53-like gene copies in polyploidy. Therefore, detection of these SNPs may provide a useful genetic biomarker for efficient monitoring of mussel population health.",

In summary, the present study shows that KA is genotoxic and mutagenic in human peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs), yeast (S. cerevisiae) and mice (bone marrow, liver and kidney) probably due to the generation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) and/or inhibition of topoisomerase I. Unlike KA, compounds 1\u20135 and KAH are completely devoid of genotoxic and mutagenic effects under the experimental conditions used in this study, suggesting that the exocyclic double bond (C16) moiety may be the active pharmacophore of the genetic toxicity of KA.",

     "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) are known to cause chromosomal aberrations (CA). The ends of DSB have different molecular structures depending on the inducing agent. Restriction endonucleases, DNase I and benzon nuclease produce DSB with 3\u2032-OH and 5\u2032-phosphate ends which should be easily rejoinable (\u201cclean\u201d DSB). Other DSB-inducing agents, such as neocarzinostatin, bleomycin and ionizing radiation induce DSB with chemically modified ends (\u201cdirty\u201d DSB) which are not religatable before enzymatic pruning to make them \u201cclean\u201d. Both \u201cclean\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d DSB lead to CA whose quantities and distributions are quite similar. We conclude that the number and not the molecular structures of DSB are essential for the production of CA. All DSB-inducing agents discussed in this review induce exchange events in the G1 phase of the cell cycle which look like sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and are therefore called \u201cfalse\u201d SCE. \u201cFalse\u201d SCE seem to be mainly intrachanges and would therefore outweigh the frequencies of interchanges. Consequently, the factor F of inter- to intrachanges would then be <1, indicating that the majority of DSB would lead to CA inside the chromosome domains in which they were induced and not between different chromosomes.",

     "abstract": "Although much is now known about the mechanisms of radiation-induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), there is less known about the conversion of DSB into chromosomal aberrations. In particular the induction and \u2018rejoining\u2019 of chromatid breaks has been a controversial topic for many years. However, its importance becomes clear in the light of the wide variation in the chromatid break response of human peripheral blood lymphocytes from different individuals when exposed to ionizing radiation, and the elevation of the frequency of radiation-induced chromatid breaks in stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes of around 40% of breast cancer cases. A common assumption has been that chromatid breaks are merely expansions of initiating DSB, although the classic \u2018breakage-first\u2019 hypothesis (Sax, Ref. 44) was already challenged in the 50's by Revell [30] who maintained that chromatid breaks were formed as a result of an incomplete exchange process initiated by two interacting lesions of an unspecified nature. Here we argue that both these models of chromatid break formation are flawed and we suggest an alternative hypothesis, namely that a radiation-induced DSB initiates an indirect mechanism leading to a chromatid break. This mechanism we suggest involves the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase II\u03b1 and we present evidence from topoisomerase II\u03b1 expression variant human cell lines and from siRNA treatment of human cells that supports this hypothesis.",

     "abstract": "Experiments were carried out to explore the correlation between chromatin conformation changes in the presence of DNA lesions and the formation of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations. To modulate the onset and dynamics of chromatin conformation changes following irradiation, premature chromosome condensation (PCC) was induced by means of cell fusion. G2-check point abrogation by caffeine or elevated heat treatment was also applied. In addition, transfer of irradiated mitotic cells was employed either into depleted media to restrain them from proceeding through G1/S, or holding them further in colcemid to avoid M/G1 transition. To investigate the correlation between efficiency of chromosomal conformation changes and chromosomal breakage in irradiated G0 peripheral blood lymphocytes, cell fusion with different mitotic PCC-inducer cells was used. The experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that functional cell-cycle chromatin conformation changes in the presence of DNA damage are important determinants in the formation of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations. Specifically, it is proposed here that following irradiation, chromatin structure may not be broken but instead it unfolds to a conformation that is more accessible to repair enzymes at the sites of DNA lesions. If subsequent chromosomal conformation changes occur while DNA is still being repaired, such changes will lead into an energetically unfavorable state, thus exerting mechanical stress on the unfolded chromatin at the damaged sites, which will in turn result into chromatid breaks that may not be able to restitute or mis-rejoin. Therefore, this biophysical conversion process of DNA damage into chromatid breaks as such is antagonistic to the DNA repair process. Alternatively, in the absence of chromosomal conformation changes, either DNA repair will take place efficiently or DNA misrepair will cause the formation of exchanges and chromosomal rearrangements. Consequently, the type and yield of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations at a given cell cycle stage will be the combined effect of the interaction, at that particular stage, of the DNA repair process and the proposed conversion process of DNA lesions into chromatid breaks.",

Normal human fibroblasts were irradiated with about 110\u00a0keV/\u03bcm of carbon (135\u00a0MeV/n), neon (400\u00a0MeV/n) and silicon ions (490\u00a0MeV/n), and the doses of carbon (3.25\u00a0Gy), neon (2.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0Gy) and silicon (2.31\u00a0Gy) were chosen to produce approximately the same number of initially measured G1-premature chromosome condensation (PCC) breaks (about 37 excess fragments per cell). The number of G1-PCC breaks was counted as excess fragments of prematurely condensed chromosomes using the PCC technique in the G1/G0 phase. The fractions of residual G1-PCC breaks after 24\u00a0h post-irradiation and half time, which is the time point where 50% of initially measured G1-PCC breaks are rejoined (t1/2), of the slow components of rejoining in carbon- and neon-ion irradiated cells were different from those of silicon-ion irradiated cells. However, no difference was observed in the half time of the fast components of rejoining in each ion beam. The results suggest that the difference in the fractions of residual G1-PCC breaks after 24\u00a0h post-irradiation reflect the result of the slow repair process for induced G1-PCC breaks, and that the repair process is dependent on the ion species, not the LET values.",

For this study human lymphocytes were exposed to 9.5\u00a0MeV/u C-ions (1 or 2 Gy, LET\u00a0=\u00a0175\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) or X-rays (1\u20136 Gy), harvested at 48, 72 or 96\u00a0h post-irradiation and aberrations were scored in first cycle metaphases using 24 color fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH). Additionally, in selected samples aberrations were measured in prematurely condensed G2-phase cells. Analysis of the time-course of aberrations in first cycle metaphases showed a stable yield of simple and complex exchanges after X-ray irradiation. In contrast, after C-ion exposure the yields profoundly increased with harvesting time complicating the estimation of the frequency of aberrations produced by high LET particles within the entire cell population. This is especially true for the yield of complex exchanges. Complex aberrations dominate the aberration spectrum produced by C-ions. Their fraction was about 50% for the two measured doses. In contrast, isodoses of X-rays induced smaller proportions of complex aberrations (i.e. 5% and 15%, respectively). For both radiation qualities the fraction of complexes did not change with harvesting time. As expected from the different dose deposition of high and low LET radiation, complex exchanges produced by high LET C-ions involved more breaks and more chromosomes than those induced by isodoses of X-rays. Noteworthy, C-ions but not X-rays induced a small number of complex chromatid\u2013isochromatid exchanges that are not expected for cells exposed in the G0-phase. The results obtained so far for cells arrested in G2-phase confirm these patterns. Altogether our data show that the increased effectiveness of C-ions for the induction of aberrations in first cycle cells is determined by complex exchanges, whereas for simple exchanges the relative biological effectiveness is about one.",

The cells were regularly subcultured up to senescence. The transition to senescence was determined by measurement of population doubling numbers and senescence associated (SA) \u03b2-galactosidase activity. Chromosomal changes (structural aberrations, tetraploidy) were investigated by solid staining.In temporal proximity to senescence, we observed for all populations of the two fibroblasts cell strains an increase in the fraction of cells with structural and numerical aberrations. The observed changes in the yield of structural chromosomal aberrations were similar for the progeny of controls and irradiated cells, except that a previous irradiation with a high, fractionated X-ray dose resulted in a stronger increase. Noteworthy, delayed tetraploidy in the descendants of irradiated cells exceeded the level in control cells. In addition, tetraploidy and the time of onset of senescence were significantly correlated for all populations, regardless of a preceding radiation exposure. However, the time of the onset of senescence depends on previous exposure to radiation. We conclude that the occurrence of tetraploidy is associated with senescence independently of exposure to radiation.",

Comparison of present dose responses between \u03b3-rays and neutron irradiations for the fraction of cells with damaged chromosome 3 yielded a relative biological effectiveness (RBE) value of 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 for the secondary neutrons. Our results also revealed that secondary neutrons of low dose rate induced a higher fraction of intrachromosome exchanges than \u03b3-rays, but the fractions of inversions observed between these two radiation types were indistinguishable. Similar to the previous findings after acute radiation exposures, most of the inversions observed in the present study were accompanied by other aberrations. The fractions of complex type aberrations and of unrejoined chromosomal breakages were also found to be higher in the neutron-exposed cells than after \u03b3-rays. We further analyzed the location of the breaks involved in chromosome aberrations along chromosome 3, and observed hot spots after \u03b3-ray, but not neutron, exposures.",

Statistical analysis using combined data for all astronauts indicated a significant overall decreasing trend in total chromosome exchanges with time after flight, although this trend was not seen for all astronauts and the yield of chromosome damage in some individuals actually increased with time after flight. The decreasing trend in total exchanges was slightly more significant when statistical analysis was restricted to data collected more than 220 days after return from flight. When analysis was restricted to data collected within 220 days of return from the mission there was no relationship between total exchanges and time.

The reasons for the conflicting results are not known, but the majority of studies were performed with lymphocytes of a single donor collected at one time point. We performed a study to verify if individual variability could be a confounding factor. As a positive control, lymphocytes were also exposed to high LET radiation (neutrons and alpha-rays), where an effect of harvesting time on the level of damage is expected to be seen.Blood was drawn from a total of 8 donors at two time points and exposed to X-rays, 6\u00a0MeV neutrons or alpha particles generated by an Am-241 source. Whole blood cultures were set up and micronuclei (Mn) were scored in binucleated cells harvested after 72, 96 and 120\u00a0h of culture time. The results show that in lymphocytes exposed to X-rays, the frequency of Mn was generally not influenced by the culture time while for both neutrons and alpha particles consistently increased micronucleus frequencies with culture time were detected. Some individual variability was detected and the conflicting results regarding the relationship between the yield of cytogenetic damage and lymphocyte culture time can, at least partly, be due to this variability.",

This reflects the relative roles of slow and fast repair in the formation of exchange aberrations. The underlying basis for slow and fast repairing components of the DNA repair may be related to differential localization of the initial damage in the genome, i.e., between relaxed and condensed chromatin. We have tried to gain some insight into this problem by (a) X-irradiating lymphocytes in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) a potent scavenger of radiation-induced OH radicals followed by PCC and (b) probing the damage and repair in two specific chromosomes, 18 and 19, which are relatively poor and rich in transcribing genes by COMET\u2013FISH, a combination of Comet assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques.Results obtained show (a) that both fast appearing and slowly formed exchange aberrations seem to take place in relaxed chromatin, since they are affected to a similar extent by DMSO, (b) significant differential DNA breakage of chromosome 18 compared to chromosome 19 in both G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle as detected by Comet assay, indicating that relaxed chromatin containing high densities of transcriptionally active genes shows less fragmentation due to fast repair (chromosome 19) compared to chromosome 18, and (c) that relaxed chromatin is repaired or mis-repaired faster than more compact chromatin.",

The distribution of chromosome breakpoints in euchromatic and heterochromatic regions of the X chromosome from TCR deficient and proficient Chinese hamster cell lines was studied. Most UVC-induced breakpoints occurred in euchromatic regions of the X chromosome in both cell lines. No increase of UVC-induced breakpoints in the euchromatic region of the UV61 X chromosome was observed, indicating that TCR failure alone cannot be responsible for the increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations.

The mode of cell death induced by ACL was evaluated by flow-cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. We show that the drug induced both apoptosis and necrosis in the cells. Apoptotic cell death was associated with morphological changes, DNA fragmentation, changes in activity of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP) and drug-mediated activation of caspase-3 and caspase-8. The occurrence of all these events was time-dependent. The extent of apoptosis was also dependent on the kind of cell line, the sensitivity to ACL and the intracellular drug content. This study demonstrates that the cells most sensitive to ACL, A549, accumulated a significantly higher level of the drug and were also more susceptible to apoptosis than the other cells.

In order to correlate the genotoxic potential of sediments with genetic damage in fish, rainbow-trout liver (RTL-W1) cells were exposed in vitro to acetone extracts of sediments collected at 10 selected sites along the upper Danube River and analyzed in the comet and micronucleus assays. These in vitro results were compared with micronucleus formation in erythrocytes of the European barbel (Barbus barbus) caught in the field. The two in vitro bioassays showed excellent correlation, indicating comparability of genotoxic potentials in vitro. Sampling sites could be clearly differentiated with respect to severity of effects, with Rottenacker as the most heavily contaminated site, Ehingen and Schwarzach as moderately genotoxic, and with the weakest effects in the tributary Lauchert. All other sediment extracts showed intermediate genotoxic or clastogenic effects. In situ, micronucleus formation in barbel erythrocytes indicated severe genotoxicity at Rottenacker, moderate effects at Ehingen, but minor contamination at Riedlingen and Sigmaringen. In situ observations thus showed excellent correlation with corresponding in vitro tests and document the ecological relevance of in vitro studies with sediment extracts. With respect to the ecological status of the Danube River, the results overall indicate a moderate to severe genotoxic potential with a highly differential localization.",

The unfiltered samples were tested up to concentrations of 170\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and the filtered samples up to 216\u00a0\u03bcg/ml before filtration. When tested in the same concentration range as used in the comet assay, none of the clays produced ROS in a cell-free test system (the DCFH-DA assay). Inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used to detect clay particles in the filtered samples using aluminium as a tracer element characteristic to clay. The results indicated that clay particles were absent in the filtered samples, which was independently confirmed by dynamic light-scattering measurements. Detection and identification of free quaternary ammonium modifier in the filtered sample was carried out by HPLC-Q-TOF/MS and revealed a total concentration of a mixture of quaternary ammonium analogues of 1.57\u00a0\u03bcg/ml. These findings suggest that the genotoxicity of organo-modified montmorillonite was caused by the organo-modifier. The detected organo-modifier mixture was synthesized and comet-assay results showed that the genotoxic potency of this synthesized organo-modifier was in the same order of magnitude at equimolar concentrations of organo-modifier in filtrated Cloisite\u00ae 30B suspensions, and could therefore at least partly explain the genotoxic effect of Cloisite\u00ae 30B.",

Two hypergolic compounds, dimethylamino-2-ethylazide (DMAZ) and N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032-tetramethylethanediamine (TMEDA), have been identified as possible replacements for MMH. We have obtained genotoxicity data for these compounds from in vitro and in vivo studies. DMAZ did not produce any mutagenic effects at concentrations up to 5\u00a0mg/plate in the TA98 and TA1537 strains of Salmonella typhimurium and in an Escherichia coli (WP2 uvrA) strain, with or without metabolic activation, but did produce a positive response in the TA100 and TA1535 strains, both with and without metabolic activation. TMEDA was found not to be mutagenic in any of the bacterial strains tested (Salmonella TA98, TA100, TA1535, TA1537 and E. coli, WP2 uvrA), with or without metabolic activation. DMAZ did not induce structural chromosomal aberrations at levels up to 5\u00a0mg/mL in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with or without metabolic activation. TMEDA produced a positive response in this system, with or without metabolic activation, but only at the highest concentration, 5\u00a0mg/mL. However, according to the OECD guideline TG 473, the compound is considered to be negative in the CHO chromosomal aberration assay, since the compound was not clastogenic at 0.01\u00a0M (1.140\u00a0mg/mL). DMAZ and TMEDA, when tested in vivo in the CD-1 mouse at doses up to 500 and 250\u00a0mg/kg, respectively, did not induce micronuclei in bone marrow erythrocytes. These studies demonstrate that DMAZ is mutagenic in specific strains of Salmonella. However, both compounds were negative for induction of chromosomal aberrations in CHO cells in vitro and in the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay.",

There is interest in developing biomarkers of genotoxicity in different phyla and the need to increase our understanding of the impact of genotoxic insult on invertebrates, particularly on crustaceans. Freshwater invertebrates and particularly amphipods are highly relevant species ecologically. However, genotoxic responses of such species are rarely studied, whereas understanding these responses is becoming an urgent concern.The aim of this study was to develop and optimize the Comet assay in the freshwater invertebrate Gammarus fossarum by use of different cell-types: haemocytes, oocytes and spermatozoa. In a first step, the Comet assay was performed on these three cell types after exposure to the model genotoxicant methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) in vitro and in vivo. Results showed a clear dose\u2013response relationship for all tissues, a low variability and a high sensitivity of the response, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Comet assay to detect genotoxic insult in amphipods. In a second step, to explore the potential of this technique for use in ecotoxicological studies with amphipods, these organisms were exposed to five known or suspected genotoxic compounds. The results demonstrated the possibility to use the freshwater amphipod G. fossarum in environmental genotoxicity studies with the Comet assay.",

We have investigated the potential of five different PFCs to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to induce oxidative DNA damage in HepG2 cells. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) increased the intracellular ROS production by 1.52-fold (95% CI, 1.37\u20131.67) and 1.25-fold (95% CI, 1.10\u20131.40), respectively. However, the increase in ROS production was not concentration-dependent and the compounds did not generate DNA damage that could be detected by the alkaline comet assay as strand breakage and alkali-labile sites or formamidopyrimidine-DNA-glycosylase (FPG) sites. Perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) did not generate ROS or DNA damage. Only the exposure to perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) caused a modest increase in DNA damage at a cytotoxic concentration level, which was detected as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release into the cell medium. This was not related to ROS generation. Collectively, these results indicate that PFCs induce only modest effects in terms of ROS production and DNA damage in a cell line representing the human liver.",

According to our previous experiments, a 6-min continuous exposure per day for 5 days to GSM-900\u00a0MHz and DCS-1800\u00a0MHz (Digital Cellular System) mobile phone radiation, brought about a large decrease in the insect's reproductive capacity, as defined by the number of F1 pupae. This decrease was found to be non-thermal and correlated with an increased percentage of induced fragmented DNA in the egg chambers\u2019 cells at early- and mid-oogenesis. In the present experiments we show that intermittent exposure also decreases the reproductive capacity and alters the actin-cytoskeleton network of the egg chambers, another known aspect of cell death that was not investigated in previous experiments, and that the effect is also due to DNA fragmentation. Intermittent exposures with 10-min intervals between exposure sessions proved to be almost equally effective as continuous exposure of the same total duration, whereas longer intervals between the exposures seemed to allow the organism the time required to recover and partly overcome the above-mentioned effects of the GSM exposure.",

Although a wide range of genotoxic agents that do not initiate DSB induce \u03b3H2AX, the range of chemicals that cause H2AX phosphorylation is not clear. We designed a novel, whole cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (cell-ELISA) that can accurately quantify \u03b3H2AX levels and identify chemical compounds that induce \u03b3H2AX formation; our novel assay is more convenient than microscopic examination of \u03b3H2AX foci or flow cytometry. We measured \u03b3H2AX levels in CHL, CHO and V79 cells exposed to DNA-damaging, non-genotoxic and aneugenic chemicals using the cell-ELISA assay. The cell-ELISA results for the DNA-damaging compounds (methyl methanesulfonate, N-ethyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, mitomycin C, cisplatin, irinotecan, etoposide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil) assayed showed that there was a concentration-dependent increase in \u03b3H2AX, which was 1.5-fold greater than the negative control; the only exception was a negative response of CHO cells to 5-fluorouracil. None of the 10 non-genotoxic compounds assayed showed similar increases in \u03b3H2AX and all exhibited concentration-dependent growth inhibition of the cells. The highest levels of \u03b3H2AX found from treatment with aneugens (vincristine, colcemid, paclitaxel, griseofulvin, 17-allylaminogeldanamycin and CH3310395), which are compounds that cause spindle dysfunction and have no genotoxic activity in the Ames test, were 1.5-fold lower than the negative control. In contrast, mitomycin C and etoposide, which both have aneugenic and DNA-damaging activities, induced a positive response. None of the aneugens caused an increase in \u03b3H2AX at concentrations that induce micronuclei. The chemical classes that show positive results in the cell-ELISA are different from those that are positive in the Ames or in vitro micronucleus test.

The comet assay and the micronucleus (MN) test were performed on hemocytes and gill cells of C. fluminea. For the three different times tested, the comet assay indicated DNA damage in hemocytes and gill cells of C. fluminea exposed to GWSF. The MN test detected significant damage in the genetic material of the hemocytes only after 96\u00a0h of exposure to GWSF. The recovery capacity of organisms previously exposed for 6\u00a0h to GWSF was also evaluated with the comet assay. The results revealed a great capacity of this species to repair DNA damage; following 6\u00a0h of recovery, the comet score returned to that of the control groups. Overall, our findings indicate that GWSF has genotoxic and mutagenic effects on C. fluminea. In addition, the present results confirm the sensitivity of C. fluminea to damage caused by exposure to environmental contaminants, and, therefore, its suitability for use in environmental monitoring studies.",

The present study was aimed to investigate the kinetics of MN formation as well as to identify the time of maximum MN induction in the peripheral blood erythrocytes in juvenile rats and thereafter to examine its relationship with the observed DNA damage in the lymphocytes as determined by comet assay. The rat peripheral blood micronucleus (PBMN) assay is generally not preferred owing to the selective elimination of micronucleated cells from the circulation by spleen. However, inefficient splenic removal of micronucleated cells in the juvenile Sprague\u2013Dawley (SD, 26 days) rats conferred advantage to be a suitable model for PBMN assay. The kinetics of MN formation and DNA damage in the peripheral blood were determined with cyclophosphamide (50\u00a0mg/kg), chlorambucil (30\u00a0mg/kg), methotrexate (20\u00a0mg/kg), cisplatin (5\u00a0mg/kg) and paclitaxel (0.5 and 1\u00a0mg/kg). All the tested chemicals with different mechanisms of action have induced time-dependant changes in the MN frequency in the peripheral blood erythrocytes. Comet assay in the peripheral blood lymphocytes also revealed similar pattern of rise and fall in the DNA damage. MN frequency and the different comet assay parameters exhibited significant positive correlation with all the tested chemicals and in both of the assays the peak was observed in between 36 and 48\u00a0h post-treatment. Results of the present study clearly demonstrates that MN frequency in the peripheral blood erythrocytes exhibits positive correlation with the DNA damage in the peripheral blood lymphocytes as evident from different comet assay parameters.

SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold did not show mutagenicity either in frame-shift or in base-substitution indicator strains, TA98 and TA100, respectively. These results were observed both in the presence and in the absence of supernatant from a rat-liver homogenate S9. Mutagenicity of these stains was not observed although their toxic concentration was reached. Toxic effects of SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold were seen approximately at the same molar concentrations as reported previously for SYBR Green I. As expected, ethidium bromide revealed strong mutagenicity with a maximum increase of 60-fold above the vehicle controls in the frame-shift indicator strain TA98 in the presence of rat-liver S9 extract.

The present study aims to establish a simple and rapid dose assessment technique based on scoring of rings and fragments in PCC spreads of stimulated lymphocytes. Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were gamma irradiated to different doses (6.2\u201324.5\u00a0Gy), cultured for two days with PHA and were forced to condense prematurely using 500\u00a0nM Okadaic acid (OA). The chromosome spreads were prepared, stained with Giemsa and observed under a microscope. The PCC index, PCC rings, and PCC fragments were scored for each dose point to arrive at the dose effect curve for various end points such as induction of rings and fragments and dicentrics. The PCC index varied from 12\u201318% up to 18\u00a0Gy and thereafter dropped to 6\u20138% at higher doses. The dose dependent increase in rings and fragments was found to be linear with a slope of 0.054\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001\u00a0Gy\u22121 for rings and 0.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0Gy\u22121 for PCC fragments. An experiment was carried out to simulate partial-body exposure by mixing 10\u00a0Gy in vitro irradiated blood with un-irradiated blood in different proportions. The ratio of frequency of damaged cells among the total number of cells analyzed was found to be a good index of partial-body exposure. The culture duration was extended to 72\u00a0h to overcome the cell cycle delay induced by high doses of radiation. The conventional dicentrics rings and fragments also showed a dose response at high doses. The response can be best fitted to a linear model with a slope of 0.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.0007\u00a0Gy\u22121 for the induction of dicentrics. However, long culture duration, technical skill and time required to analyse multi-aberrant cells makes the dicentric assay less suitable for high dose exposures requiring a rapid dose estimate. The PCC assay can be performed in 50\u00a0h with biodosimetric information about the irradiated fraction in cases of acute radiation exposures. The automated finding of PCC spreads significantly increased the speed of scoring PCC fragments.",

The insects were exposed to each type of radiation at an intensity of about 10\u00a0\u03bcW/cm2, corresponding to a distance of 20 or 30\u00a0cm from the antenna of a DCS 1800 or a GSM 900 mobile phone handset, respectively. At these distances the bioactivity of mobile telephony radiation was found to be at a maximum due to the existence of a \u201cwindow\u201d of increased bioactivity around this value, as we have shown recently [1], [2], [3], [4]. The results show that the reproductive capacity decreases almost linearly with increasing exposure duration to both GSM 900 and DCS 1800 radiation, suggesting that short-term exposures to these radiations have cumulative effects on living organisms. Additionally, our results show again that GSM 900\u00a0MHz radiation is slightly more bioactive than DCS 1800\u00a0MHz radiation, at the same exposure durations and under equal radiation intensities, as shown in our previous experiments [5].",

     "abstract": "\u03b2-Caryophyllene is a bi-cyclic sesquiterpene that occurs in essential oils from several plants. A variety of biological activities have been ascribed to this compound. In particular, it seems to possess anti-carcinogenic properties, due to its capability to induce detoxifying enzymes or to enhance, in vitro and in vivo, the natural killer cell-induced cytotoxicity against tumours. Conversely, the knowledge on the DNA-damaging activity of the substance and its modulation is scanty. Therefore, in this study, we aimed at evaluating the capability of \u03b2-caryophyllene to protect cultured human lymphocytes from the genotoxic damage induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) and colcemid (COL) in the micronucleus assay. To investigate the mechanisms of action of this sesquiterpene, the cultures were treated with the compound before (pre-treatment), during (co-treatment) and after (post-treatment) treatment with the mutagens.Up to 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, \u03b2-caryophyllene by itself did not produce any cytotoxic and genotoxic effect, as shown by the value of the nuclear division index (NDI) and the frequency of micronuclei (MN).The test compound (0.1\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) significantly reduced the MN frequency induced by EMS in pre- and co-treatment protocols (up to 64.4% and 87% reduction, respectively). In the post-treatment protocol, \u03b2-caryophyllene was not effective as an antimutagen. No significant reduction of COL-induced MN frequency was found.The antigenotoxic activity of \u03b2-caryophyllene observed here suggests that this compound could act by chemical interaction with the mutagen in the growth medium (co-treatment) or in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes (pre-treatment), so acting as a desmutagen. These data encourage further studies to investigate the mode of action and the potential use of this compound as a chemopreventive agent.",

The impact of air pollution on the level of chromosomal aberrations was systematically studied: analyses were performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with whole-chromosome painting for chromosomes #1 and #4. In the present study, we analyzed the levels of stable (one-way and two-way translocations) and unstable (acentric fragments) chromosomal aberrations in 42 mothers living in Prague and in their newborns. The average age of the mothers was 29 years (range, 20\u201340 years). Blood samples were collected from October 2007 to February 2008. The average levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (c-PAHs) and benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) in respirable particles (PM2.5), as determined by stationary monitoring, were 21.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.3\u00a0ng/m3 and 2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0ng/m3, respectively. We did not observe any effect of either c-PAH or B[a]P exposure on the genomic frequency of translocations (per 100 cells, FG/100) in either group due to their similar exposure during the winter months. The mean values of FG/100 representing stable aberrations were 0.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 vs 0.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for newborns vs mothers, indicating a significant increase of FG/100 with age. On the other hand, the frequency of unstable aberrations did not differ between the two groups. Our results demonstrate how the patterns of different types of aberration differed between newborns and mothers: we observed 64.3% unstable aberrations and 35.7% stable aberrations in newborns vs 19.7% and 80.3% in mothers, respectively. Our results indicate that after birth the frequencies of aberrations are very low and that the aberrations are represented mainly by acentric fragments. The changes observed in mothers show a shift to stable aberrations represented mainly by two-way translocations. The mother's age affected the level of aberrations in newborns: the group of children born to older mothers (31\u201340 years) had significantly increased FG/100 levels.",

Recently, it has been reported that the homologous recombination (HR) mechanism is involved in the repair of DPCs, suggesting the homologous recombination could be a potential indicator for the genotoxicity/mutagenicity of FA. However, it has not yet been reported that organisms harboring recombination substrates are used for the detection of genotoxic/mutagenic effects of FA. In this present study, an Arabidopsis thaliana-line transgenic for GUS recombination substrates was used to study the genotoxicity/mutagenicity of FA, and the results showed that FA-exposure significantly increased the induction of HR in growing plants, but not in dormant seeds. We also observed an early up-regulation of expression of HR-related gene, AtRAD54, after FA-exposure. Moreover, the pretreatment with glutathione (GSH) suppressed drastically the induction of HR by FA-exposure.",

Although there are several diagnostic assays for these disorders, the recovery of RNA synthesis (RRS) assay that can discriminate between XP cells and CS cells is very laborious. Here, we report on a novel non-radioisotope RRS assay that uses bromouridine (a uridine analog) as an alternative to 3H-uridine. This assay can easily detect RNA polymerase I transcription in nucleoli and RNA polymerase II transcription in nuclei. The non-RI RSS assay also can rapidly detect normal RRS activity in HeLa cells. Thus, this assay is useful as a novel and easy technique for CS diagnosis. Because RRS is thought to be related to transcription-coupled DNA repair, which is triggered by the blockage of transcriptional machinery by DNA lesions, this assay may be of use for analysis of DNA repair, transcription, and/or genetic toxicity.",

In this version, the electrophoresis is performed directly on the MCP, which makes transferring of cells to microscope slides unnecessary.In order to facilitate the scoring procedure we adapted an automated slide-scanning system (Metafer MetaCyte with CometScan) to enable unattended analysis of comets on the MCP. The results of the system were compared with the data obtained with two interactive comet-assay analysis systems. For induction of DNA damage in human fibroblasts methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) or H2O2 was used. The three systems revealed similar, concentration-dependent results for all parameters tested: tail moment (tm), % DNA-in-tail and olive tail moment. Near the detection limit of 5\u20136% DNA-in-tail a significant difference with the untreated control was obtained by use of four parallel samples (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). With the newly developed automated analysis system, the evaluation of either 50 or 100 comets yielded similar standard errors for either treatment with MMS or H2O2, thus showing that the method is suitable to reveal the crucial low-dose effects with high precision. The results also show that the time needed for automated evaluation of comets on the MCP was reduced by a factor of 10 when compared with the time required for interactive evaluation. In summary, the high-throughput version of the comet assay combined with the automated evaluating system increased the output by a factor up to 180 compared with the standard method.",

     "abstract": "The SHE cell transformation assay has traditionally been conducted with a feeder layer of X-ray irradiated cells to provide growth support to the target cells seeded in low numbers. The need for an X-ray irradiated feeder cell layer necessitates the maintenance of an X-ray machine and the additional step to seed feeder cells prior to plating target cells. This laboratory has previously reported a method allowing target cells to be seeded in conditioned media prepared from the stock culture flasks in lieu of plating them on a feeder layer (Pant et al. [1], [2], [4]). In order to expand the data base for chemicals tested using this method, we describe in this paper the results obtained testing Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) and N-nitroso-N-methylnitroguanidine (MNNG) which are known to give positive responses in the standard SHE cell transformation assay.With freshly prepared conditioned medium (used within 2 weeks of preparation), there was essentially no difference in the number of target cell colonies in the conditioned medium and in the plates with the X-ray irradiated feeder cell layer. The plating efficiencies of the vehicle controls were within the historical range for the standard SHE cell transformation assay. In more than ten experiments the positive control benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] elicited a significant increase in morphological transformation frequency (MTF), with or without X-ray irradiated feeder cells. Compounds, DEHP and MNNG, were tested in the SHE cell transformation assay with and without an X-ray irradiated feeder layer and using a 7-day exposure regimen. The results were comparable between experiments performed using either method. These results demonstrate the feasibility of conducting the SHE cell transformation assay without the use of an X-ray irradiated feeder layer, thereby simplifying the test procedure and assisting the scoring of morphologically transformed colonies.",

     "abstract": "Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of 37 formaldehyde-exposed women from four pathology departments in Hungary were investigated to collect data on the effects of occupational exposures to formaldehyde and to find a possible relationship between in vivo formaldehyde-induced apoptosis and genotoxic effects. The subjects were divided into two groups: 16 donors exposed to formaldehyde together with various organic solvents, and 21 subjects exposed mainly to formaldehyde. The results were compared with 37 controls (all women) without known occupational exposure. Ambient air concentrations of formaldehyde were measured in three work places, and ranged from 0.23 to 1.21\u00a0mg/m3 (mean 0.9\u00a0mg/m3). Measures of genotoxicity included the determination of the frequencies of chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister-chromatid exchange (SCE), HPRT mutations (variant frequency, VF) and the measurement of UV-induced unscheduled DNA-repair synthesis (UDS). The percentages of premature centromere division (PCD) and of cells with a high frequency of SCE (HF/SCE) were also scored. Apoptosis and cell proliferation were determined by flow cytometry. In both formaldehyde-exposed groups, the apoptotic activity and the CA levels in PBLs were significantly higher than in controls. The CA were mostly breaks of the chromatid type. In the second group, which was mainly exposed to formaldehyde, CA were slightly lower in comparison with the group exposed to formaldehyde and solvents, which may be attributed to a different rate of elimination of damaged lymphocytes as a consequence of formaldehyde-induced apoptotic activity. In the second group, a significant decrease of VF and a non-significant increase in HF/SCE were found compared with the control and the other group. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that exposure to formaldehyde induces apoptosis and CA, indicating an excess cancer risk among subjects occupationally exposed to formaldehyde. The results also emphasize the importance of the measurement of occupational air pollutants, such as formaldehyde, in order to avoid genotoxic effects in the workers.",

The integrity of sperm DNA is important both for the success of assisted reproduction and the implications for the off-spring. One type of DNA damage that has not been investigated with respect to fertility outcomes is the adduct N7-methyldeoxyguanosine (N7-MedG), a biomarker for exposure to alkylating agents. A prospective cohort of couples attending for IVF had their N7-MedG levels in sperm measured using an immunoslot blot technique to examine whether sperm N7-MedG levels are associated with male factor infertility, semen quality measures or assisted reproduction outcomes. Sufficient DNA for analysis was obtained from 67/97 couples and N7-MedG was detected in 94% of sperm samples analysed. Men diagnosed with male factor infertility had significantly higher mean levels of N7-MedG in their sperm DNA (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Logistic regression analysis showed that N7-MedG levels were significantly negatively associated with the proportion of oocytes successfully fertilised irrespective of the method of fertilisation used (IVF or intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection; ICSI, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Therefore exposure to DNA alkylating agents is significantly associated with male infertility and the proportion of oocytes fertilised during assisted reproduction. Reducing such exposure may improve male fertility but further work is required to determine the relative importance of exogenous and endogenous sources of exposure.",

The genotoxic rodent hepatocarcinogen, 2,6-dinitrotoluene showed a positive result in the liver micronucleus assay, but the nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogens, clofibrate and thioacetamide gave negative responses. Bromobenzene, known to produce DNA adducts but is noncarcinogenic in rodent liver, was judged equivocal in this assay. \u03b1-Naphthyl isothiocyanate is noncarcinogenic and showed negative response in the liver. The other four chemicals, known to be either noncarcinogenic or carcinogenic in other non-liver target organs, showed negative results in the liver micronucleus assay. Based on the results in the present study and previous report described above, it was concluded that this technique is able to effectively predict genotoxic rodent hepatocarcinogenicity, and does not give false positives due to hepatotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "Hydroxyurea induces fetal hemoglobin, improves laboratory parameters, and ameliorates clinical complications of sickle cell anemia (SCA), but its long-term efficacy and safety in this patient population remain incompletely defined. Although generally considered non-DNA reactive, an important safety concern is that hydroxyurea may indirectly cause genotoxic damage. To better address this safety issue of hydroxyurea in patients with SCA, we measured the production of micronuclei (MN) in red blood cells (RBCs) as a marker of genotoxicity.Blood samples were collected from children with SCA enrolled in the Hydroxyurea Study of Long-term Effects (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00305175). Flow cytometry quantified circulating MN-containing erythrocyte sub-populations before and during hydroxyurea exposure. The frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-CD71+) and micronucleated mature erythrocytes (MN-RBC) was then tested for associations with laboratory and clinical data. In cross-sectional analysis of 293 blood samples from 105 children with SCA and a median of 2 years of hydroxyurea therapy, exposure to hydroxyurea was associated with significantly increased frequencies of MN-CD71+ and MN-RBC compared to baseline. The increases were evident by 3 months of therapy, and did not escalate further with up to 12 years of continuous drug exposure. In prospective longitudinal analysis, substantial inter-individual variation in the effect of hydroxyurea on %MN-CD71+ was observed that was associated with the expected laboratory effects of hydroxyurea.In conclusion, clinically relevant exposure to hydroxyurea is associated with increased MN production consistent with erythroblast genotoxicity but with substantial inter-patient variability. Associations between increased %MN-CD71+ and laboratory benefits suggest that hydroxyurea effects on MN production may be related to individual patient sensitivity to hydroxyurea within the bone marrow.",

     "abstract": "Fish constitute an excellent model to understand the mechanistic aspects of metal toxicity vis-\u00e0-vis oxidative stress in aquatic ecosystems. Hexavalent chromium (Cr (VI)), due to its redox potential can induce oxidative stress (OS) in fish and impair their health. In the present investigation, we hypothesize that OS plays a key role in chromium induced toxicity in goldfish; leading to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as O.2, H2O2, OH., and subsequent modulation of the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), metallothioneins (MT), glutathione proxidase (GPx), genotoxicity and histopathology. To test this hypothesis, antioxidant enzymes, DNA damage and histopathology assays were performed in liver and kidney tissues of goldfish exposed to different concentrations of Cr (VI) (LC12.5, LC25 and LC50) following 96\u00a0h static renewal bioassay. The results of this study clearly show that the fish experienced OS as characterized by significant modulation of enzyme activities, induction of DNA damage and microscopic morphological changes in the liver and kidney. In both tissues, CAT activity was decreased whereas SOD activity and hydroperoxide levels were increased. In addition, GPx activity also increased significantly in higher test concentrations, especially in the kidney. MT induction and DNA damage were observed in both tissues in a concentration dependent manner. Microscopic examination of organ morphology indicated degeneration of liver tissue and necrosis of central vein. Necrosis of kidney tubular epithelial cells and tubules was observed at higher Cr (VI) concentrations. Taking together the findings of this study are helpful in organ-specific risk assessment of Cr (VI)-induced oxidative stress, genotoxicity and histopathology in fish.",

Additional aims were to study the participation of HR and NER in promoting UV survival during the cell cycle, and to define the extent of the co-participation for both repair pathways.The sensitivity of yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to UV light was determined using a method based on automatic measurements of optical densities of very small (100\u00a0\u03bcl) liquid cell cultures.We show that pseudo-diploidy of sir\u0394 strains promotes resistance to UV irradiation and that HR is the main mechanism that is responsible for this phenotype. In addition, HR together with GG-NER renders cells in the G2-phase of the cell cycle more resistant to UV irradiation than cells in the G1-phase, which underscore the importance of HR when two copies of the chromosomes are present. Nevertheless, in asynchronously growing cells NER is the main repair pathway that responds to UV induced DNA damage.This study provides detailed and quantitative information on the co-participation of HR and NER in UV survival of yeast cells.",

     "publication date": "03-2010",
     "abstract": "One of the biggest problems with orthopaedic joint replacements has been the tendency for metal-on-polyethylene implants to produce particulate wear debris. These particles stimulated adjacent macrophage infiltration, which caused destruction of bone and soft tissue, resulting in aseptic loosening of the implant. This problem led to the development of new implants with articulating surfaces that produce less volumetric wear (metal-on-metal, MOM, and ceramic-on-ceramic, COC). To determine whether there could be adverse biological effects from exposure to particulate wear debris after total hip replacement (THR), we investigated the in vitro genotoxic effects of alumina ceramic (Al2O3) particles in comparison with cobalt\u2013chrome metal (CoCr alloy) particles.Primary human fibroblasts were exposed to Al2O3 nanoparticles or CoCr alloy particles (0.1\u201310\u00a0mg/T-75 flask) for 5 days. There were no significant differences in cell viability between control and ceramic-treated cells, at all doses and time-points studied. Cells exposed to CoCr alloy particles showed both dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity. There was a small but significant increase in micronucleated binucleate cells after 24\u00a0h of treatment with >1\u00a0mg/T-75 flask of alumina particulates compared with controls, although no clear dose\u2013response was observed. The induction of micronuclei was unaffected by the size or shape of the ceramic particles. The increase in micronucleated binucleate cells was much greater after exposure to CoCr particles for 24\u00a0h, showing a clear dose\u2013response curve. No increase in gamma-H2AX foci was noted in cells exposed to ceramic particles, in contrast with a significant increase of these foci in cells exposed to CoCr particles at comparable mass/surface doses. Cytogenetic analysis showed that both types of particle caused mainly numerical rather than structural chromosomal aberrations, with a greater number and variation of lesions induced by CoCr particles. In conclusion, our results show that alumina (Al2O3) ceramic particles are only weakly genotoxic to human cells in vitro when compared with metal (CoCr alloy) particles.",

The most effective ones were the Trad-MN and, unexpectedly, the branched-hair tests. A preliminary result of the study is the somaclonal variation of individual Tradescantia plants revealed by the RAPD method of DNA analysis. A comparison of aqueous extracts and DMSO extracts of the soil showed the permanent character of the mobile forms of genotoxic pollutants in the soil surface, despite the fact that several military territories were already closed 20 years ago.",

     "abstract": "Glaucoma is typically an insidious-onset disease with serious visual consequences that has been positively linked to diabetes mellitus (DM). Glaucoma is more often present in the elderly. Important prognostic factors of glaucoma may be oxidative stress resulting from the toxic effects of glucose, and diabetes-associated vascular complications.Fifty-five patients and control subjects aged 71.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.1 yrs were enrolled in this study. Iris-tissue samples from DM type-2 patients, primary open-angle glaucoma-positive and -negative DM patients, and from healthy subjects were examined by use of the alkaline comet assay. We measured the DNA damage as numbers of strand breaks (SBs), oxidized purines as glycosyl-formamido-glycosylase (Fpg)-susceptible sites, and oxidized pyrimidines as endonuclease III (Nth)-susceptible sites. It was found that the level of oxidative damage in iris tissue was statistically higher in DM and glaucoma patients than that in healthy controls (oxidized purines: 38.0% and 34.7% vs 15.4%; oxidized pyrimidines: 43.3% and 39.0% vs 23.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Interestingly, we found strongly elevated levels of oxidized purines and pyrimidines in glaucomatous patients who also had DM, in comparison with healthy controls (oxidized purines: 55.7% vs 15.4%; oxidized pyrimidines: 61.8% vs 23.3%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

     "abstract": "In human biomonitoring, factors such as age, gender, smoking habit and alcohol consumption are usually considered and identified as agents that exert an impact on genotoxicity biomarkers. However, as a rule, factors like micronutrient status are not considered in biomonitoring studies. This paper reports on genotoxic damage in Pb-exposed workers using data obtained from the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) cytome assay and alkaline comet assay with silver staining, considering folate and vitamin B12 nutritional status. Analysis of the results showed that the Pb-exposed group presented a 24-fold higher Pb content in the blood compared to controls. The Pb-exposed workers presented significantly greater micronuclei (MNi) counts (Z\u00a0=\u00a07.9583; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and DNA damage, assessed by the comet assay (DF: Z\u00a0=\u00a07.7056; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 and DI: Z\u00a0=\u00a07.4749; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but no correlation with Pb blood concentrations were detected. These two groups did not differ significantly concerning folate and vitamin B12 levels. Regarding folate, it is possible that this similarity is associated with folic acid flour-enrichment, introduced in Brazil in 2004 to prevent neural tube defects. The mean folate level obtained in the Pb-exposed group was 6.18\u00a0ng/ml. The subgroup of individuals with serum folate levels equal to or higher than the mean presented significantly higher MNi (Z\u00a0=\u00a02.3776; p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) and nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB) frequencies (Z\u00a0=\u00a01.9850; p\u00a0=\u00a00.047) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. A significant positive correlation was observed between the age of Pb-exposed workers and MNi frequencies (\u0393\u00a0=\u00a00.3328; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), NPBs (\u0393\u00a0=\u00a00.1832; p\u00a0<\u00a00.042) and DNA damage assessed by the comet assay (DF: \u0393\u00a0=\u00a00.1764; p\u00a0=\u00a00.035 and DI: \u0393\u00a0=\u00a00.11852; p\u00a0=\u00a00.028). These findings suggest that high folate levels alone do not guarantee protection against genotoxic damage. Moreover, folic acid supplementation should be studied using more efficient approaches to determine safe amounts and potential deleterious effects.",

     "abstract": "Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a non-flammable, non-explosive, colorless gas. It is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and an important chemical intermediate in several industrial processes. The toxicological properties of SO2, including its genotoxic potential, have been studied extensively. The majority of the available in vitro data indicate a lack of genotoxicity of SO2, while for sulfite salts some positive results have been reported. However, recent in vivo studies, using Kunming albino mice, have pointed to in vivo clastogenicity of SO2. To re-evaluate these positive findings, a bone-marrow micronucleus test according to OECD Guideline No. 474 was performed. NMRI mice (m/f) were exposed by inhalation via whole-body exposure to 0 (clean air), 2.7, 8, 27, or 80\u00a0mg/m3 (0, 1, 3, 10, or 30\u00a0ppm) SO2 for 4\u00a0h/day on 7 consecutive days. Animals were sacrificed 24\u00a0h after start of the last exposure, and blood samples (for complementing hematology) and bone marrow smears (for analysis of micronuclei) were prepared. Under the conditions used, exposure to SO2 caused no acute toxicity, mortality, or reduction in body weight. Compared with the clean-air controls, hematological parameters such as hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocyte/platelet/total leukocyte counts, differential white blood cell counts, and indicators of blood formation (reticulocyte counts, ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow) remained unchanged by SO2 treatment. Unlike the previously reported studies on micronucleus formation, SO2 did not induce micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes of the bone marrow, whereas the positive control cyclophosphamide (60\u00a0mg/kg body weight) was quite effective in this respect. Interestingly, SO2 treatment significantly enhanced malondialdehyde levels in erythrocyte lysates (TBARS method), indicating SO2-mediated oxidative stress, but also demonstrating systemic availability of the inhaled SO2. In conclusion, the present study could not reproduce the genotoxicity findings of the previously reported studies. SO2 is thus considered non-genotoxic in polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of NMRI mice under the conditions and in the concentrations used.",

The major point is the small variation in the reported data, which is below the theoretical lower limit derived from multinomial distributions and also lower than those derived from detailed simulations.

     "abstract": "In this study we separated weakly acidic phenolic components from other neutral, acidic and basic components of tobacco smoke condensate (TSC) and observed that phenolic fraction of TSC significantly increased the number of colonies of promotion-sensitive JB6 Cl41 cells that showed anchorage-independent growth on soft agar in response to BPDE (an ultimate carcinogen produced by metabolic activation of the PAH benzo[a]pyrene). Anchorage-independent cell growth is indicative of cell transformation resulting in acquisition of tumorigenic potential. In order to understand the underlying mechanism by which TSC phenolic fraction potentiates BPDE-induced tumorigenicity, we examined its effect on the activation of two transcription factors AP-1 and NF-\u03baB which are known to be influenced by established tumor promoter TPA. BPDE treatment caused induction of both AP-1 and NF-\u03baB activity as determined by luciferase reporter assay and only NF-\u03baB induction in response to BPDE was significantly attenuated by TSC phenolic fraction whereas AP-1 induction remains unaltered. Attenuation of NF-\u03baB activation by TSC phenolic fraction was associated with significant decrease of intracellular PKC substrate phosphorylation in BPDE treated cells. Non-specific PKC inhibitors staurosporine and bisindolylmaleimide II as well as inhibitors specific to conventional PKCs (Go6976) and PKC-\u03b4 (rottlerin) attenuated NF-\u03baB activation in BPDE treated cells to a varying degree indicating a possible link between PKC down-regulation and the attenuation of NF-\u03baB activity by TSC phenolic fraction. Treatment of cells with PKC inhibitors also potentiated anchorage-independent growth of BPDE treated cells on soft agar. Our data suggest a possible role of PKC down-regulation in potentiation of BPDE-induced tumorogenicity by TSC phenolic fraction.",

     "abstract": "Earthworms native to the former mine site of Devon Great Consols (DGC), UK reside in soils highly contaminated with arsenic (As). These earthworms are considered to have developed a resistance to As toxicity. The mechanisms underlying this resistance however, remain unclear. In the present study, non-resistant, commercially sourced Lumbricus terrestris were exposed to a typical DGC soil in laboratory mesocosms. The earthworms bio-accumulated As from the soil and incurred DNA-damage levels significantly above those observed in the control mesocosm (assessed using the Comet assay). A dose response was observed between DNA damage (% tail DNA) and As concentration in soil (control, 98, 183, 236, 324 and 436\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121). As-resistant earthworms (Lumbricus rubellus, Dendrodrilus rubidus and L. terrestris) collected from contaminated soils at DGC (203 to 9025\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121 As) had also bio-accumulated high levels of As from their host soils, yet demonstrated low levels of DNA damage compared with earthworms from uncontaminated sites. The results demonstrate that the As-contaminated soils at DGC are genotoxic to non-native earthworms and much less so to earthworms native to DGC, thus providing further evidence of an acquired resistance to As toxicity in the native earthworms.",

All of the Sprague-Dawley rats did not show any mortality and clinical signs of toxicity after intravenous injection at the level of 2.4\u00a0g/kg body weight.

PCEC nanomaterials did not induce chromosomal aberrations in cultured Chinese hamster lung cells up to 5000\u00a0\u03bcg/mL with or without metabolic activation. Micronucleus assay demonstrated that PCEC nanomaterials did not significantly increase micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCE) in the bone marrow of ICR mice or suppress bone marrow, indicating they did not cause chromosome aberrations.

Serum level of thyroid hormone was reduced by fission neutrons from the nuclear reactor UTR-KINKI, and changes in thyroid hormone by fission neutrons were bigger than those by low LET radiations, X-rays and 137Cs \u03b3-rays, suggesting high relative biological effectiveness (RBE; 6.5) of fission neutrons. Microarray analyses revealed that about 3% of genes showed more than 4-fold change in gene expression in the unexposed thyroid tissues against surgically resected thyroid tissues from the same patient, probably due to the difficult oxygen and nutrient supply shortly after transplantation. Dose-dependent changes in gene expression against unexposed concurrent controls were observed with increasing doses of fission neutrons (0.2\u20130.6\u00a0Gy) and 137Cs \u03b3-rays (1.0\u20133.0\u00a0Gy) and showed high RBE (4.2). Furthermore, there were some specific genes which showed more than 4-fold change in gene expression in all the thyroid tissues exposed to higher doses of radiation, especially neutrons (0.4 and 0.6\u00a0Gy), but none at lower doses (0.2\u00a0Gy of neutrons and 1.0 and 2.0\u00a0Gy of \u03b3-rays). These genes related to degeneration, regeneration, apoptosis, and transcription, respond specifically and very sensitively to neutron injury in human thyroid tissues. This is the first experimental report that fission neutrons can induce some morphological and functional disorders in human tissues, showing high RBE against \u03b3-ray exposure. These results are useful to evaluate the risks of fission neutrons and cosmic rays to humans.",

Two cell lines (human hepatoma cells, HepG2; human diploid lung fibroblasts, HEL) were treated for 24 and 48\u00a0h with various concentrations of compounds and mixtures. A panel of oxidative stress markers included 8-oxodeoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), 15-F2t-isoprostane (15-F2t-IsoP) and protein carbonyl groups. The response of the cell lines to the test compounds was substantially different. In HepG2 cells, oxidative damage to DNA was generally not induced by individual c-PAHs and the c-PAHs mix, but EOM increased 8-oxodG levels in these cells. In HEL cells, none of the compounds induced oxidative DNA damage. Lipid peroxidation, measured as the level of 15-F2t-IsoP, was induced by c-PAHs in HepG2 cells only after 48\u00a0h of incubation, while the effect of EOM was detected already after 24\u00a0h. In HEL cells, individual c-PAHs and the c-PAH mix generally decreased 15-F2t-IsoP levels. This effect was even stronger for EOM treatment. Protein oxidation, assessed as carbonyl levels in cell lysates, was not induced after 24\u00a0h of treatment with any compound in either cell line. Individual c-PAHs and the c-PAH mix generally induced protein oxidation in both cell lines after 48\u00a0h treatment, with the exception of DB[a,l]P in HepG2 cells. Oxidative damage to proteins caused by EOM was generally increased in HepG2 cells after 48\u00a0h of incubation, while in HEL cells the effect was observed for only one dose of EOM. In summary, our results demonstrate the ability of EOM to induce oxidative damage to DNA and lipids after 24\u00a0h of treatment, and to proteins after 48\u00a0h, in HepG2 cells, while the effect of c-PAHs was substantially less.

     "abstract": "Resin-based methacrylate materials are widely used in restorative dentistry. They are viscous substances that are converted into solid material via polymerization. This process, however, may be incomplete, leading to the release of monomers into the oral cavity and the pulp, which can be reached through the dentin micro-channels. This opens the opportunity for the monomers to reach the bloodstream. Monomers can reach concentrations in the millimolar range, high enough to cause cellular damage, so it is justified to study their potential toxic effects. In the present work we investigated the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and A549 lung-tumour cells. HEMA at concentrations up to 10\u00a0mM neither affected the viability of the cells nor interacted with isolated plasmid DNA during a 1\u00a0h exposure. However, HEMA induced concentration-dependent DNA damage in lymphocytes, as assessed by alkaline and pH 12.1 versions of the comet assay. HEMA did not cause double-strand breaks, as assessed by the neutral version of the comet assay and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The use of DNA repair enzymes, spin traps and vitamin C produced results suggesting that HEMA induced oxidative modifications to DNA bases. DNA damage caused by HEMA at 10\u00a0mM was removed within 120\u00a0min. HEMA induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner and caused cell-cycle delay at the G0/G1-checkpoint. Methylglycol chitosan displayed a protective effect against the DNA-damaging action of HEMA. The results obtained in this study suggest that HEMA induces adverse biological effects, mainly via reactive oxygen species, which can lead to DNA damage, apoptosis and cell-cycle delay. Chitosan and its derivatives can be considered as additional components of dental restoration to decrease the harmful potency of HEMA.",

The target of these antineoplastic agents is nuclear DNA for CIS and microtubules for PAC, although it is not restricted to malignant cells. In this study, the genotoxicity of the combined treatment of PAC and CIS was investigated using the standard version of the wing Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila melanogaster. Quantitative and qualitative genotoxic effects of these compounds were estimated by comparing wing spot frequencies in marker-heterozygous to balancer-heterozygous flies. Two different concentrations of PAC (0.0025 and 0.005\u00a0mM) and CIS (0.025 and 0.05\u00a0mM) as well as combinations of them were employed. The results demonstrated that the spindle poison PAC alone was not genotoxic in this test system, while CIS was able to induce a high incidence of DNA damage in both genotypes, mainly related to somatic recombination. The data obtained for the combined treatments showed that its genotoxicity varied with the concentrations used. In small concentrations the number of total spots induced by combination was reduced in relation to CIS 0.025\u00a0mM just for marker-heterozygous flies, showing that somatic recombination was the prevalent event involved. At higher concentrations the combined treatment showed significant reductions in the frequencies of large single spots, for both genotypes, and twin spots for marker-heterozygous flies, but did not significantly reduce the total spots frequency in either genotype. The data suggest that aneugenic activity of PAC could be responsible for the reduction in the genotoxicity of CIS.",

We have studied direct mutagenesis induced by N-nitroquinoline, and indirect mutation induction caused by metabolically activated 2-AF. The fractions enriched in isoflavonoids, obtained by sequential liquid\u2013liquid extraction with diethyl ether and butanol, followed by ODS column separation, inhibited indirect mutagenesis in TA98 almost completely. In TA100 the maximum inhibition ranged between 80% and 100% depending on the test fraction. The inhibition of direct mutagenesis was lower, reaching about 50% in TA98 and in TA100, but it was dose-dependent only in the latter strain. Three in vitro anti-oxidant spectrophotometric assays\u2014DPPH free-radical scavenging test, the phosphomolybdenum assay, and the linoleic acid peroxidation assay were also performed to support the process of bioactivity-guided fractionation and to provide more information about the potential mechanisms of action of the herb under study. The isoflavonoid fractions have the capability to scavenge free radicals, to reduce transition-metal ions and to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids from peroxidation. The analysis of the fractions obtained with high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode-array and mass-spectrometric detection revealed several potentially bioactive isoflavones, either as glycosides or aglycones, depending on the polarity of the solvents used for fractionation. The main compounds were tectoridin and iridin in the glycoside fractions and the aglycones irigenin, tectorigenin, and 5,6,7,3\u2032-tetrahydroxy-4\u2032-methoxyisoflavone.

     "abstract": "It is thought that high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation induces more complex DNA damage than low-LET particles, specifically clustered DNA damage that causes cells to repair DNA double strand breaks (DSB) more slowly and leads to severe biological consequences. The present study aimed to investigate the role of exogenously added glutathione (GSH) on 12C-beam (287\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) and 7Li-beam (60\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) induced chromosome aberration (CA) formation, particularly on exchange aberration formation. In order to characterize the role of GSH in the joining of DNA DSBs, we induced DNA lesions with bleomycin (Blem) in conjunction with either high- or low-LET radiation (X-rays) since the chemistry of the free DNA ends created by Blem and X-rays is similar. CHO cells were exposed to reduced GSH at a concentration of 2\u00a0mM for 3\u00a0h before radiation. Treatment with Blem (20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) was carried out for 2\u00a0h before the cells were exposed to radiation. Our results show that the frequency of chromosomal aberration increases with increased LET. Heavy ion exposed cells show a higher frequency of CA over time than do X-irradiated cells. An analysis of the first post-irradiation mitosis of exposed CHO cells shows that high-LET radiation induces more breaks than exchange-type aberrations and exogenous GSH has no influence on high-LET radiation-induced DNA damage. The DNA lesions induced by low-LET radiation interact relatively strongly with Blem-induced lesions whereas interaction between Blem and high-LET radiations was poor. This could be attributed to differences in repair kinetics and qualitative differences in the DNA lesions induced by Blem and high-LET radiation.",

Conventional cytotoxicity assessment methods, such as trypan blue dye exclusion or relative cell number (cell counts) may not be the most biologically relevant measurement for cytotoxicity in this assay. Thus, we evaluated for decreased levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and activation of Caspase-3/7 as well as relative cell number and trypan blue exclusion in order to understand the correlation among test compound concentration, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity outcomes in the Comet assay. We tested two non-genotoxic and non-cytotoxic compounds (d-glucose and ethanol), two non-genotoxic but cytotoxic compounds (2,4-dichlorophenol and tunicamycin) and four genotoxic and cytotoxic compounds (methyl methanesulfonate, ethyl methanesulfonate, etoposide and 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide) in TK6 human lymphoblast cells. Our data show that measuring ATP and Caspase-3/7 levels provides more rapid and perhaps more biologically relevant measures of cytotoxicity compared with trypan blue dye exclusion and relative cell number. Furthermore, incorporating these two assays into the Comet assay also provided insight on the cytotoxic mode of action of the chemicals tested.

     "abstract": "Methylchavicol (or estragole), a natural flavouring substance present in tarragon, was confirmed as a genotoxic chemical in the in vitro UDS test in cultured rat hepatocytes and in the in vivo UDS test in hepatocytes of exposed rats. Deep-frozen tarragon was clearly less genotoxic than methylchavicol at equivalent dose levels, and desiccated tarragon was negative. Both forms of tarragon tested in vitro have the ability to decrease significantly the genotoxicity of methylchavicol added to the culture medium at concentrations \u226410\u00a0\u03bcM for deep-frozen and \u226455\u00a0\u03bcM for desiccated tarragon. The decrease may be attributed to antimutagenic properties of tarragon leaves and/or to adsorption of methylchavicol, which would decrease its bioavailability. Desiccated tarragon powder was not genotoxic in the in vivo UDS test when administered up to the maximum dose of 6.25\u00a0g/kg bw (18.75\u00a0mg/kg bw of methylchavicol). In vivo, desiccated tarragon did not show antimutagenic properties, because it did not decrease the genotoxicity of methylchavicol added at high concentrations.Considering the low exposure level at the maximum daily tarragon consumption, the rapid detoxification and excretion in humans and the no-genotoxic-effect-level of methylchavicol by the oral route when given to rats as tarragon leaves, a high margin of exposure exists. We can conclude that tarragon consumption presents no genotoxic risk to humans.",

     "abstract": "Esophageal cancer (EC) is among the 10 most common and fatal malignacies in the world, presenting a marked geographic variation in incidence rates between and within different countries. The TP53 tumor suppressor gene is highly mutated in esophageal tumors and its mutation pattern can offer clues to the etiopathology of the tumor. As Brazil presents one of the highest incidence areas in the West, a deeper knowledge of the molecular mechanisms related to EC development in the Brazilian population is needed. We analyzed the mutation profile of 110 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCC) of patients from Southeastern Brazil (Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo) and collected data regarding alcohol intake and tobacco smoking. We detected 41 mutations in tumor samples from 38 patients. There was no association between mutation frequency and tobacco smoking or alcohol drinking. The most frequently mutated codons were 179, 214, 220 and 248. Codons 179, 220 and 248 are hot-spots for ESCC, but codon 214 presents only 0.7% of the mutations registered in the IARC database. The mutation profile revealed a high percentage of mutations at A:T base pairs (34.1%) followed by deletions (17.1%). We concluded that the mutation profile detected in this study is different from that of patients from Southern Brazil but very similar to that previously seen in French patients, being characterized by a high frequency of mutations at A:T base pairs, which may be associated with acetaldehyde, the metabolic product of ethanol.",

Since no freeware programme for the analysis of gamma-H2AX foci exists for a PC platform, the aim of our study was to develop a simple and user-friendly public-domain software. The algorithm applied in our programme allows determination of the number of foci in a single cell, a focus intensity per cell, as well as a cell intensity. Its graphical user interface is based on a GTK+ library and the whole application can be run under a variety of operating systems, including MS Windows and Linux. The programme called FociCounter is publicly available at http://focicounter.sourceforge.net.

     "abstract": "Four different mechanism-based high-throughput luciferase-reporter assays were developed in human HepG2 cells, which contain phase I and II metabolic activity and a functionally active p53 protein. The promoter regions of RAD51C and Cystatin A, as well as the responsive element of the p53 protein, were selected for the generation of the genotoxicity reporter assays. Moreover, a luciferase-based reporter assay was generated that measures the activation of the Nrf2 oxidative stress pathway.Validation with respect to the ECVAM compound list [D. Kirkland, P.

Speit, Recommended lists of genotoxic and non-genotoxic chemicals for assessment of the performance of new or improved genotoxicity tests: a follow-up to an ECVAM workshop, Mutat. Res. 653 (2008) 99\u2013108] resulted in an overall sensitivity of the HepG2 genotoxicity reporter assays for genotoxicity of 85% (17/20). The specificity and predictivity were high with 81% (34/42) and 82% (51/62), respectively. Various compounds had a positive score although metabolic activation was needed. The HepG2 reporter data were also compared with the available data on bacterial mutagenicity (Ames test), in vitro clastogenicity and in vivo clastogenicity for an additional set of 192 compounds. The predictivity for mutagenicity results was 74% (sensitivity, 61%, 30/49; specificity, 80%, 77/96) and for in vitro clastogenicity 59% (sensitivity, 45%, 35/78; specificity 83%, 38/46). The correlation between results from the HepG2 genotoxicity reporter assays and in vivo clastogenicity was much higher with 77% (sensitivity, 74%, 28/38; specificity 81%, 26/32). Results from the Nrf2 reporter assay showed that a large number of genotoxic compounds activated the Nrf2 oxidative stress pathway.In conclusion, four high-throughput mechanism-based reporter assays in the HepG2 cell line were developed, which can be applied for screening in the early research phase of drug development. The use of these assays in combination with the previously validated Vitotox and RadarScreen assays will certainly reduce the attrition rate due to genotoxicity in the developmental phase of drug development.",

     "abstract": "DNA topoisomerases (topos) are the target of several drugs commonly used in cancer chemotherapy; these drugs induce topo-DNA complexes with either topo I or topo II that eventually trigger cell death. The inhibition of these enzymes induces DNA alterations that may also lead to carcinogenic effects; indeed, an increased risk for developing leukemia has been observed in patients treated with some topo II inhibitors. Several flavonoids have been shown to interact with purified topo I and topo II, therefore suggesting that these compounds may possess both anticancer and carcinogenic activity. Because the activity of a drug on purified topoisomerases does not always represent the activity in the cell, the aim of this work is to evaluate the effects of several common dietary flavonoids on these enzymes in cells. Using the cell-based TARDIS assay, we have evaluated the effects of the flavonoids quercetin, apigenin, fisetin and myricetin on topo I and topo II in K562 human leukemia cells at several concentrations and exposure times. Quercetin and apigenin induced moderate levels of topo II-DNA complexes and did not induce topo I-DNA complexes in these cells. Fisetin induced neither topo I- nor topo II-DNA complexes, but behaved as a catalytic inhibitor of both enzymes. Myricetin induced high levels of topo-DNA complexes with both enzymes. In addition, murine embryo fibroblasts lacking topo II\u03b2 were resistant to myricetin-induced cell-growth inhibition, therefore suggesting that topo II\u03b2 is an important drug target for this flavonoid. These results support the idea that specific concentrations of some dietary flavonoids may produce topoisomerase-mediated carcinogenic and chemotherapeutic effects in vivo. The ability of myricetin to induce topo-DNA complexes with both topo I and topo II in leukemia cells may be therapeutically useful and deserves further study.",

Our investigation showed that the results of 12 CSCs in CCK-8 and cell apoptosis assays were positive, the results of 11 CSCs in neutral red uptake and comet assays were positive, and 9 CSCs could induce significantly the micronuclei in micronucleus assay. It was found that the potency to induce the cytotoxic effects among 12 CSCs ranged 9.694 folds in neutral red uptake assay and 6.43 folds in CCK-8 assay, the potency to induce cell apoptosis among 12 CSCs ranged 8.191 folds, the potency to induce DNA damage among 12 CSCs ranged 29.199 folds, the potency to induce micronuclei among 12 CSCs ranged 5.879 folds.

     "abstract": "The industrial compound and food contaminant acrylamide (AA) is a probable human carcinogen, also known to induce male-mediated reproductive effects in animals. Most data suggest that its metabolite glycidamide (GA) is involved in the observed toxicity. We have investigated in vitro effects of AA/GA in mouse male germ cells (prior to spermatid elongation) and human and mouse peripheral blood lymphocytes, to assess inter-species and cell-type differences in susceptibility, and to explore the nature of the DNA lesion(s) as well as their potential repair. The comet assay was used in combination with the DNA-repair enzymes Fpg and hOGG1 to measure specific DNA lesions. In contrast to AA, GA induced significant levels of DNA lesions (strand breaks and alkali-labile sites) at millimolar concentrations in mouse testicular cells and human peripheral blood lymphocytes (hPBL). Using Fpg, the GA-induced DNA damage was measured at 20\u201350-fold higher sensitivity, in all cell types investigated. GA-induced DNA damage could not be recognised by hOGG1, suggesting that, based on the known affinities of these repair enzymes, alkylation of guanine is involved, rather than oxidation. Human lymphocytes appeared to be more susceptible to GA-induced lesions than both types of mouse cells. Mouse testicular cells and lymphocytes seemed to respond similarly to GA-induced Fpg-sensitive DNA lesions. The persistence of lesions was explored with cells from mice either proficient or deficient in Ogg1 (mouse 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase). Low in vitro repair of GA-induced Fpg-sensitive lesions was observed in primary male germ cells and lymphocytes from both Ogg1+/+ and Ogg1\u2212/\u2212 mice. We conclude that there may be differences between mice and humans in AA/GA-induced genotoxicity, and DNA from mouse male germ cells does not appear to be more sensitive to GA than DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro. The usefulness of the comet assay in combination with DNA-repair enzymes is demonstrated.",

Among the individual components of OCPs, much higher coefficients of variance (0.38\u20131.57) for each compound were detected, indicating significant difference of OCP residues among different areas over the lake. Mutagenicity of the crude extractable organic matter (EOM) from surface sediments in six typical regions was performed with Salmonella/microsome tests (Salmonella strains TA98 and TA100 with/without metabolic activation S9 mix). TA98 was more sensitive and the main mutagens detected were frameshift toxicants. Sediments collected from the north-west showed higher potency to induce mutagenicity than other regions. Poor correlation between OCP concentrations and mutagenicity suggested OCPs were not responsible for the detected mutagenic effects in sediments. Combining chemical analysis with bioassays will be a novel and useful tool for finding out the responsible environmental mutagens.",

Astaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant and possess several beneficial effects against various human diseases and physiological disorders. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of astaxanthin against cyclophosphamide-induced oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell death and induction of GST-P foci in rat liver. Further attempt has been made to study the influence of astaxanthin on antioxidant response element (ARE) and the transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor E2-related factor 2) in the induction of phase-II enzymes NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase-1(NQO-1) and Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1). Both pre- and post-treatment with astaxanthin (25\u00a0mg/kg) decreased cyclophosphamide-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in the liver as evident from the restoration in malondialdehyde and glutathione level as well as modified comet assay parameters. Significant decrease in the number as well as area of GST-P foci in rat hepatocytes was observed with astaxanthin post-treatment. Treatment with astaxanthin significantly decreased the expression of p53 and p38 as compared to cyclophosphamide treated group. It was further observed that the level of Nrf2 and phase-II enzymes, i.e. NQO-1 and HO-1 were increased with astaxanthin treatment. The present study confirms that astaxanthin is a potent antioxidant and attenuates oxidative stress, DNA damage, cell death as well as induction of early hepatocarcinogenesis in rat induced by cyclophosphamide.

The average maternal age was 24.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0S.D.) years. Thirty-nine percent of the Caucasian Americans and 45.4% of the African Americans self-reported that they were active smokers during the index pregnancy. The average number of cigarettes smoked per day was 2.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.75 and 1.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.17 for Caucasian and African American mothers, respectively. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from the mother and from the fetal side of the placenta were evaluated for chromosome aberrations by whole chromosome painting. Aliquots from the same blood samples were also used to assess genetic susceptibility with an in vitro bleomycin challenge assay. Spontaneous translocation frequencies in both maternal and newborn lymphocytes were not associated with cigarette smoking, socioeconomic status, or education. The absence of a smoking effect may be attributable to the low level of cigarette usage in these subjects. The average bleomycin-induced damage in the maternal and newborn populations was 0.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27 and 0.15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 breaks per cell, respectively, a difference that was highly significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). In newborns there was a positive association between bleomycin sensitivity and the frequencies of aberrations as measured by chromosome painting: p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.0007 for dicentrics and fragments, and p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.002 for translocations. Caucasian American newborns demonstrated a significant association between dicentrics and fragments as measured by painting, and bleomycin sensitivity (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.0002), but no such association was observed for African American newborns. The results of this study indicate that while differences were observed between African Americans and Caucasian Americans, race does not appear to be a major contributor to chromosome damage in newborns or their mothers.

     "abstract": "Arsenic is a human carcinogen, and only recently animal models have been developed that are useful in investigating its carcinogenic mode of action (MOA). However, how arsenic induces cancer is still an open question. In a previous paper, we proposed a model detailing how arsenic might induce DNA lesions leading to cytogenetic damage [A.D. Kligerman, A.H. Tennant, Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 222 (2007) 281\u2013288]. In this model we hypothesized that arsenic does not induce chromosome damage via DNA adduction but induces short-lasting lesions from the action of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These lesions cause single-strand breaks (SSB) that induce chromosome breakage when treatment is in late G1- or S-phase. However, if treatment is confined to the G0- or early G1-phase of the cell cycle, it is predicted that little or no cytogenetic damage will result at the subsequent metaphase. Here, we describe the results from testing this model using monomethylarsonous acid (MMAIII) and cytosine arabinoside (araC), a DNA chain terminator, to extend the time that DNA lesions remain open during repair to allow the lesions to reach S-phase or interact to form DNA exchanges that would lead to exchange aberrations at metaphase. The results of our study only partially confirmed our hypothesis. Instead, the results indicated that the lesions induced by MMAIII are quickly repaired through base excision repair, that there is little chance for araC to extend the life of the lesions, and thus the DNA damage induced by arsenicals that leads to chromosome aberrations is very short lived.",

The results demonstrated that (1) RFR could not directly induce DNA damage of human B-cell lymphoblastoid cells; (2) DOX could significantly induce DNA damage of human B-cell lymphoblastoid cells with the dose\u2013effect relationship, and there were special repair characteristics of DNA damage induced by DOX; (3) E\u2013E\u2013E type (exposure to RFR for 2\u00a0h, then simultaneous exposure to RFR and DOX, and exposure to RFR for 6\u00a0h, 12\u00a0h, 18\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h after exposure to DOX) combinative exposure could obviously influence DNA repair at 6\u00a0h and 12\u00a0h after exposure to DOX for four DOX doses (0.075\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 0.10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 0.15\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 0.20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) in human B-cell lymphoblastoid cells.",

     "abstract": "A\u00e7ai, the fruit of a palm native to the Amazonian basin, is widely distributed in northern South America, where it has considerable economic importance. Whereas individual polyphenolics compounds in a\u00e7ai have been extensively evaluated, studies of the intact fruit and its biological properties are lacking. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the in vivo genotoxicity of a\u00e7ai and its possible antigenotoxicity on doxorubicin (DXR)-induced DNA damage. The a\u00e7ai pulp doses selected were 3.33, 10.0 and 16.67\u00a0g/kg b.w. administered by gavage alone or prior to DXR (16\u00a0mg/kg b.w.) administered by intraperitoneal injection. Swiss albino mice were distributed in eight groups for acute treatment with a\u00e7ai pulp (24\u00a0h) and eight groups for subacute treatment (daily for 14 consecutive days) before euthanasia. The negative control groups were treated in a similar way. The results of chemical analysis suggested the presence of carotenoids, anthocyanins, phenolic, and flavonoids in a\u00e7ai pulp. The endpoints analyzed were micronucleus induction in bone marrow and peripheral blood cells polychromatic erythrocytes, and DNA damage in peripheral blood, liver and kidney cells assessed using the alkaline (pH >13) comet assay. There were no statistically significant differences (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) between the negative control and the groups treated with the three doses of a\u00e7ai pulp alone in all endpoints analyzed, demonstrating the absence of genotoxic effects. The protective effects of a\u00e7ai pulp were observed in both acute and subacute treatments, when administered prior to DXR. In general, subacute treatment provided greater efficiency in protecting against DXR-induced DNA damage in liver and kidney cells. These protective effects can be explained as the result of the phytochemicals present in a\u00e7ai pulp. These results will be applied to the developmental of food with functional characteristics, as well as to explore the characteristics of a\u00e7ai as a health promoter.",

     "abstract": "To evaluate the effect of storage conditions of blood on the direct relationship between radiation-induced chromosome aberrations and apoptosis in human peripheral blood lymphocytes, whole blood was irradiated with 3\u00a0Gy X-rays. Directly after irradiation, a sample of blood was analyzed for chromosome damage and proliferation index, after phytohaemagglutinin stimulation and incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 56\u00a0h. Blood samples were stored for 48\u00a0h at 4 and 20\u00a0\u00b0C with or without phytohaemagglutinin and analyzed for cell viability and apoptosis at 0, 24 and 48\u00a0h storage time. After 48\u00a0h of storage, unstimulated cultures were stimulated to proliferate. These samples and cultures stimulated immediately before storage were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 56\u00a0h and analyzed for chromosome damage and proliferation index. Metaphases were examined for the presence of dicentrics, excess acentrics, and rings. Storage at 20\u00a0\u00b0C without phytohaemagglutinin for 48\u00a0h increases significantly the yield of apoptosis and decreases significantly the yield of dicentrics. During 48\u00a0h of storage time the presence of phytohaemagglutinin and the temperature of 4\u00a0\u00b0C protected the irradiated lymphocytes from apoptosis allowing accurate estimation of the real yield of radiation-induced chromosome damage. Therefore these blood-storage conditions enable analysis in metaphase and may offer some advantages for biodosimetry of absorbed radiation dose.",

The results showed that C-PC selectively stimulated the lymphocyte antioxidant defence system of occupationally exposed subjects. The activation of the antioxidant protective mechanisms as part of the early radiation response was probably related to the chronic low-dose occupational exposure.

The fundamental question which chromosomes the micronuclei were derived from remains to be answered. Analysis of structural chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and expression of fragile sites (FS) were pursued in this study. They revealed a significantly higher incidence of chromosomal aberrations (chromatid and chromosome breaks) in patients compared with controls, where 10 FS emerged as specific. Also, the band 17q12\u201321, where known fragile sites have not been reported, was only expressed in atenolol-treated patients. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using chromosome-specific probes revealed the preferential involvement of chromosomes 7, 11, 17 and X in the micronuclei (MN) of patients. The results also suggest a correlation between chromosomal fragility and content of MN, and support the findings for a linkage between hypertension and a locus on chromosome 17.",

Under in vitro conditions of irradiation, silibinin protected plasmid pBR322 DNA against \u03b3-radiation-induced strand breaks in a concentration dependent manner (0\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcM). Under cellular conditions of radiation exposure (3\u00a0Gy), silibinin offered protection to lymphocyte DNA as evidenced from reduction in DNA damage and micronuclei formation, which showed correlation to the extent of intracellular reactive oxygen species reduction. Our extended animal studies suggest that oral administration of silibinin (70\u00a0mg/kg for 3 days) to mice prior to whole-body \u03b3-exposure (7.5\u00a0Gy) resulted in significant protection to radiation-induced mortality and DNA damage in blood leukocytes.

     "abstract": "Male Fischer-344 rats were exposed to formaldehyde (FA) by inhalation for 4 weeks (6\u00a0h/day, 5 days/week). Groups of six rats each were exposed to the target concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 10 and 15\u00a0ppm. Potential genotoxic effects in the lung were investigated as part of a comprehensive study on local and systemic toxic and genotoxic effects. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells were obtained by lung lavage with physiological saline and counted. From one half of the cells, slides for the micronucleus test (MNT) were prepared by cytocentrifugation; with the other half, the comet assay was performed. DNA migration in the comet assay was measured both directly and after irradiation of the cells with 2\u00a0Gy gamma-radiation. The latter modification of the comet assay was included to increase its sensitivity for the detection of DNA-protein cross-links (DPX). For the comet assay, four slides were analysed from each cell sample, two without and two with irradiation. From each slide, 50 randomly selected cells were measured by image analysis and tail intensity (% tail DNA) and tail moment were evaluated. The frequency of micronucleated BAL cells was determined in acridine orange-stained slides by analysing 2000 cells per animal. FA did not induce any significant effect in any of the genotoxicity tests performed. It can be concluded that inhalation of FA in a 28 days study with FA concentrations up to 15\u00a0ppm does not lead to genotoxic effects in BAL cells of rats. Because detection of DPX by the comet assay is a very sensitive biomarker of FA exposure of cells, our results suggest that there is no genetically relevant exposure of the lung after FA inhalation. The results of our inhalation study, which was performed under GLP conditions, call into question the biological significance of previously reported genotoxic effects in the lung of rats after FA inhalation.",

     "abstract": "Evidence from in vivo studies suggests there are enhanced radiation effects in abscopal regions after local head gamma ray irradiation. Splenocyte apoptosis and T lymphocyte micronuclei were induced at higher rates than what would be estimated given the dose at a shielded, distant position. In addition, we evaluated the radio-protective effects of ascorbic acid, acting as a radical scavenger on enhanced radiation effects in the shielded spleen following local head irradiation.The heads of C3H mice were exposed to \u03b3-rays (10\u201320\u00a0Gy), while the other parts of the body were shielded with a 5\u00a0cm-thick lead block. The effective dose for the spleen was calculated at 1.0\u20132.0\u00a0Gy. Splenocytes were isolated 24\u00a0h after cranial irradiation and their apoptosis was measured with an Elisa kit (Roche). The induction of T lymphocyte micronuclei was studied using the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay. The ascorbic acid glucoside, 2-O-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-l-ascorbic acid (AA-2G), was orally administered to mice 1\u00a0h before whole body irradiation. The radio protective effects of AA-2G were estimated by comparing the induction of splenocyte damage (by apoptosis) and micronucleus induction.The splenocyte damage, as measured by the above two methods, was more excessive than what would be expected given exposure to 1.0\u20132.0\u00a0Gy of radiation. Our results suggest that the effects were enhanced in a distant, non-irradiated organ after localized irradiation. Plasma ascorbic acid concentrations were increased 8\u201310\u00d7 over control. Treatment with ascorbic acid slightly protected mouse splenocytes from the induction of apoptosis by the enhanced effects of radiation in the abscopal region. However, ascorbic acid significantly inhibited micronucleus induction in splenic T lymphocytes following local head irradiation.Our results suggest that ascorbic acid effectively scavenged radiation-induced radicals and protected against the enhanced effects of radiation in an abscopal region after local head gamma ray irradiation.",

     "publication date": "01-2010",
     "abstract": "Nucleotide-excision repair (NER) is important for the maintenance of genomic integrity and to prevent the onset of carcinogenesis. Oxidative stress was previously found to inhibit NER in vitro, and dietary antioxidants could thus protect DNA not only by reducing levels of oxidative DNA damage, but also by protecting NER against oxidative stress-induced inhibition. To obtain further insight in the relation between oxidative stress and NER activity in vivo, oxidative stress was induced in newborn piglets by means of intra-muscular injection of iron (200\u00a0mg) at day 3 after birth. Indeed, injection of iron significantly increased several markers of oxidative stress, such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) levels in colon DNA and urinary excretion of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua). In parallel, the influence of maternal supplementation with an antioxidant-enriched diet was investigated in their offspring. Supplementation resulted in reduced iron concentrations in the colon (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) at day 7 and a 40% reduction of 8-oxodG in colon DNA (P\u00a0=\u00a00.044) at day 14 after birth. NER capacity in animals that did not receive antioxidants was significantly reduced to 32% at day 7 compared with the initial NER capacity on day 1 after birth. This reduction in NER capacity was less pronounced in antioxidant-supplemented piglets (69%). Overall, these data indicate that NER can be reduced by oxidative stress in vivo, which can be compensated for by antioxidant supplementation.",

We have tested 18 synthetic BAs for potential effects in cultured HeLa cells. We found significantly higher micronucleus (MN) induction over the background level, with the solvent DMSO used as an internal control. Concentration-dependent effects were found between 1\u00a0nM and 20\u00a0nM for all the synthetic compounds studied. Immunostaining with an anticentromere antibody showed that >80% of MN induced gave a centromere-positive signal. Similarly, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis with alphoid centromere probes showed a positive hybridization signal, indicating that all compounds analyzed are aneugenic. Chemical modification of the N in the heterocyclic aromatic amine served us to suggest a relationship between the structure and the aneugenic effects of the compounds analyzed.

     "abstract": "A recent ECVAM workshop considered how to reduce falsely predictive positive results when undertaking in vitro genotoxicity testing, and thus to avoid unnecessary follow-up with tests involving animals. As it was anticipated that modified versions of existing assays as well as new assays might contribute to a solution, an expert panel was asked to identify a list of chemicals that could be used in the evaluation of such assays. Three categories of test chemicals were chosen comprising a total of 62 compounds. This paper provides test results for these chemicals using the GreenScreen HC assay. All tests were carried out in triplicate, by multiple operators, with and without S9, using invariant protocols. Group 1 chemicals should be detected as positive in in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests: 18/20 (90%) were reproducibly positive in GreenScreen HC. Group 2 chemicals should give negative results in in vitro genotoxicity tests: 22/23 (96%) were reproducibly negative in GreenScreen HC. Overall concordance for Groups 1 and 2 is 93%. Group 3 chemicals should give negative results in in vitro mammalian cell genotoxicity tests, but have been reported to induce chromosomal aberrations or Tk mutations in mouse lymphoma cells, often at high concentrations or at high levels of cytotoxicity: 13/17 (76%) were reproducibly negative in GreenScreen HC. Of the four positive compounds in Group 3, p-nitrophenol was only positive at the top dose (10\u00a0mM), 2,4-DCP is an in vivo genotoxin, and two chemicals are antioxidant compounds that may be acting as pro-oxidants in the hyperoxic conditions of cell culture. Overall, these predictive figures are similar to those from other studies with the GreenScreen HC assay and confirm its high specificity, which in turn minimizes the generation of falsely predictive positive results.",
