     "abstract": "Melanoma is one of the aggressive cancer types. Mutations that lock the BRAF protein in an active state may cause excessive signaling in the pathway, leading to uncontrolled cell growth and survival. Primarily among the BRAF mutations observed in melanoma, over 90% are supposed to be at codon 600, resulting in substitution of glutamic acid for valine, V600E (T\u00a0>\u00a0A transversion) located in exon 15, BRAFV600E. Of particular interest is BRAF negative melanoma. This type of melanoma is not sensitive to BRAF inhibitors and approaches to therapy require further study. We aimed to investigate the frequency of BRAF V600 mutations in 80 patients with primary melanoma and determine the relationship between mutations and clinical/pathologic features. Genomic DNA was extracted from biopsy specimens with prevalent percentage of tumor cells by DNA-sorb B isolation kit (Amplisense, Russia). BRAF V600E mutation was estimated by real-time PCR-based assay for the BRAF V600E mutation allele-specific DNA test (BioLink, Russia). Breslow thickness was assessed by applying commercial Infinity Capture, Infinity Analyze Software. The lymphocytic infiltration was determined in all tumors and classified as \u201cbrisk\u201d, \u201cnonbrisk\u201d, and \u201cabsent\u201d according to criteria established by Clark et al. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were identified as lymphocytes within tumor nodes. \u201cBrisk\u201d infiltrate was determined in case of a diffuse presence of lymphocytes within tumor, \u201cnon-brisk\u201d infiltrate was in focal location of lymphocytes and \u201cabsent\u201d if no lymphocytes were present in a tumor. Mitotic activity was determined as mitotic count on 10 high power fields. For all patients, clinical and pathologic features were tested for significant association with BRAF V600E mutation status using simple cross tabulations, Fisher\u2019s exact test, Pearson\u2019s \u03c72 test, and/or non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test. The P values lower 0.05 were considered as significant. BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 41.25% of tested tumours. Patients with BRAF-mutant and non-BRAF mutant melanoma were matched by age and gender. Superficial spreading melanomawas observed in 66.2% of patients with wild-type BRAF, nodular melanoma in 21.2%, both lentigo-melanoma and acral-lentiginous melanomain 6.3% and mucosal melanoma in 1 3.0% of patients. In wild-type BRAF melanoma patients, 59.7% tumors had \u201cbrisk\u201d infiltrate, 14.8% \u2013 \u201cnon-brisk\u201d, and 12 25.5% had no infiltrate. There was no found correlation between BRAF status and tumor localization, clinico-pathological type of tumor, TIL status, Breslow thickness and mitotic rate. However, when cases were stratified by age, it was revealed that melanoma patients aged above 80\u00a0years were preferentially BRAF-negative (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). BRAF-negative melanomas occurred significantly more frequent in superficial spreading type of the tumor. The localization of melanomas was different between the patients with mutant BRAF status and patients with wild-type BRAF status with regard to elderly and younger patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The mean age was 54.4\u00a0years for patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma localized on the trunk and 63.7\u00a0years for patients with wild-type BRAF. In our study, no relationship between BRAF status and tumor localization was found, although tumors localized on extremities had tendency to be BRAF V600E negative. Although our study revealed no any other associations between melanoma prognostic markers and BRAF V600E status, melanoma mutational profiling identification may be important for predicting a worse prognosis in certain patients.",

     "abstract": "During cancer development, tumor cells gain the ability to invade and metastasize. Individual cells use alternative migration modes based on different cellular mechanisms. One of them is mesenchymal motility mode which is driven by leading edge protrusion in the form of filopodia or/and lamellipodia based on Arp2/3 dependent actin polymerization. Mesenchymal motility depends on formation of cell-substrate adhesions, activity of matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and on activity of small GTPaseRac. Another mode is amoeboid motility, which involves formation of blebs \u2013 hollow membrane protrusions extruded from the cell surface by actin-myosin contraction. Amoeboid motility does not need both pronounced cell-substrate adhesions and MMPs activity and required increase of activity of small GTPase Rho. Fibroblasts and scattered epithelial cells migrate by mesenchymal mode, while blood cells \u2013 lymphocytes or macrophages mainly use amoeboid mode for migration. It was shown that some treatments cause transition from one motility mode to another. Switches from mesenchymal to amoeboid motility and opposite are called mesenchymal-amoeboid transition (MAT) and amoeboid -mesenchymal transition (AMT) respectively. The ability of cells for such transitions was named as plasticity of migration. We compared the plasticity of migration of normal and tumor cells. To study plasticity of mesenchymally migrated cells (MAT) we choose fibrosarcoma cells HT1080 as tumor and non-transformed subcutaneous fibroblasts 1036 as normal counterpart. To study AMT we choose a few lines of myeloid leukemia THP1, K562, KG1 in contrast to normal leukocytes obtained from healthy donors. We showed that fibrosarcoma cells in opposite to non-transformed fibroblasts could undergo MAT under treatments, which limited mesenchymal migration. Two approaches to limit mesenchymal motility of cells were used. One was decrease of substrate adhesiveness by treatment of coverslips with PolyHema solutions, which simulated the alteration of environmental conditions during cell migration. The other approach was influence on cellular pathways regulated cell motility. We used CK666, the inhibitor of Arp2/3 activity, which stopped actin polymerization and thus lamellipodia formation through Arp2/3 dependent mechanism. We showed that under both treatments the fraction of tumor cells switched from lamellipodia formation to blebbing and thus underwent MAT, while in non-transformed fibroblasts these treatments led to retraction of lamellipodia and significant failure of motility. Both leukemia cells and leucocytes of healthy donors showed blebs formation (amoeboid motility). We induced transition to mesenchymal motility by alteration of culture conditions. The first approach was the increase of substrate adhesiveness by treatment with fibronectin. Another way was to inhibit of small GTPase Rho activity. In result of both treatments, leukemia cells switched from amoeboid to mesenchymal motility (underwent AMT), but leucocytes of healthy donor could not do such transition. For the first time it was shown that AMT is features of leukemia cells but not leucocytes from healthy donors. Both MAT and AMT are reversible, meaning that cells exhibiting plasticity could change motility mode in dependence on environment. Our results demonstrate that tumor cells of different origin could transit from one mode of motility to another and normal cells could not undergo such transitions. We also investigate the effectiveness of amoeboid and mesenchymal motility during migration in different environments. It was shown that the mesenchymal motility is more effective for 2D migration, while the amoeboid motility is more effective in 3D conditions. During dissemination, cells go beyond the borders of original tissues and pass through environment with different properties. The plasticity of migration triggered by alteration of entire or internal conditions dramatically increases ability of cells to disseminate. The ability of tumor cells to plasticity permits them to choose optimal mode for migration, thus leading to metastasis development.",

     "abstract": "Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, remains a standard of endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) positive breast cancer (Goldhirsch et al., 2013). Despite well-known advantages of tamoxifen treatment, approximately one third of patients experience a relapse or disease progression due to tamoxifen resistance (Osborne et al., 2011). Identification of additional molecular markers associated with both ER genomic and non-genomic pathways could be very useful to help identify patients who will likely benefit from such endocrine treatment. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of the distribution pattern of ER\u03b1 expression as well as ESR1, TGF-\u03b2R1 and IGF-1R single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the expression of growth factors receptors on disease progression in breast cancer patients of Russian Western Siberian population treated by adjuvant tamoxifen.Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were retrospectively collected from 97 hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen at the Tomsk Cancer Research Institute. Genotypes for ESR1 +30T>C (rs2077647), ESR12014G>A (rs2228480), IVS7+24G>A (rs334354) and IGF-1R (rs2016347) SNPs were detected by a TaqMan assay. The distribution patterns of ER\u03b1 expression and EGFR, TGF-\u03b2R1, IGF-1R protein expression were determined using the immunohistochemistry. Patients who developed distant metastasis or recurrence after tamoxifen treatment during the follow-up period were defined as tamoxifen resistance (TR) group, while distant metastasis-free patients were analyzed as tamoxifen sensitive (TS) group.We found that the heterogeneous distribution of ER\u03b1 expression was statistically significant related with poor prognosis of tamoxifen treated patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Similarly, we showed high EGFR expression in TR group compared to TS patients (80.0% vs. 41.9% respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Additionally, EGFR expression and distribution pattern of ER\u03b1 expression were significantly associated with response to tamoxifen and this association remained significant in both univariate and multivariate analysis. Our results demonstrate that the ESR12014A mutant allele carriers were more prevalent in TR patients than in TS group (26.3% vs. 8.0%, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Concerning the IGF-1R polymorphism, we found that TT homozygous carriers were more frequent in the TS group compared with TR group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043). A significant association between IVS7+24G>A SNP and high TGF-\u03b2R1 protein expression was observed (p\u00a0=\u00a00.044). Nonetheless, among all studied polymorphisms only ESR12014G>A SNP was correlated with a heterogeneous distribution of ER\u03b1 expression (r\u00a0=\u00a00.353, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016).These data suggest that the distribution pattern of ER\u03b1 expression, EGFR expression and ESR1 2014G>A genetic variation could be useful additional prognostic markers for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.",

     "publication date": "11-2015",
     "abstract": "Tumor markers play an important role in the identification of human malignancies. It has been shown that the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, CEACAM5) is a promoter of metastasis in epithelial cancers that is widely used as a clinical marker. The aim of this study is to elucidate the network of genes that are involved in the CEA-induced liver metastasis. Previously, we have shown that CEA is accumulated in the lungs and livers of rats by interacting with their macrophages. We identified and cloned a new gene (CEAR) for the CEA-binding protein, which is located on the surface of fixed liver macrophages, Kupffer cells (Bajenova et al, 2001). It has been shown that the interaction of CEA and CEAR proteins increases the production of IL-1, IL-10, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 cytokines (Thomas et al, 2011). This interaction changes the expression of liver adhesion molecules that enhances the survival of cancer cells to the liver. We also suggested that CEA synthesis by cancer cells may influence the E-cadherin adhesion junction complexes and have shown that CEA production violates the functional relationship between Ecadherin and its partners \u03b1-, \u03b2- and p120 catenin. A new type of interaction was discovered between the CEA and \u03b2-catenin and the increased amount of \u03b2-catenin in the nuclei of CEA producing cells. The data show that CEA production can cause the dissociation of cancer cells and trigger cancer progression. The CEA synthesis also alters splicing of p120 catenin protein and causes the release of soluble E-cadherin. Previously, CEA and epithelial E-cadherin were considered as independent tumor markers. Our data explain the correlation between the elevated levels of CEA and the increase in soluble E-cadherin in the progression of colorectal cancer (Bajenova et al, 2014).We carried out a comparative transcriptome analysis of CEA-producing cell lines. The RNA transcriptome libraries were obtained and sequenced. By pairwise comparisons of CEA producing and non-producing cell lines using Cummerband program, we selected the set of genes (90 total genes) whose expression have been changed in the CEA-producing cell lines (overexpressed or downregulated). The biological processes that are linked to this differential gene expression were identified by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). In total, 8 significantly enriched GO terms related to the cellular components and biological processes were identified. Using KEGG and GO databases, we also identified the signaling pathways involved in the response to CEA. These findings have direct medical application, since they allow not only to establish the relationships between the existing biomarkers but also to discover the new ones. These biomarkers can be used for diagnosis and monitoring of metastatic carcinomas and for the drug development.",

     "abstract": "Discovery of new pharmacologically active small molecules is an important and rapidly expanding area of modern molecular pharmacology. Given a limited number of proteins that are druggable, it is important to identify as many chemical effectors as possible to define the best regimen of anti-cancer therapy in each particular case. An E3 ubiquitin ligase, Mdm2, which mediates ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the critical tumor suppressor p53, is a promising target for small molecule inhibitors. Using a hybrid approach which combines the rational design of small molecules selected from the virtual library and the high-content screening using cancer cell lines we discovered several new inhibitors of the p53-Mdm2 interaction. These compounds were able to activate and stabilize the p53 protein causing massive apoptosis preferably in p53-positive cells at rates higher than the well-known inhibitor of Mdm2, Nutlin-3. The molecular mechanisms of their action will be discussed.As another example of rational design of potential anti-cancer drugs, we will talk about artificial nano-Matrix-Imprinted -Polymers (MIPs) that recognize the structure of peptides and other biological molecules and thus dubbed as \u201cplastic antibodies\u201d. We have generated such nanoparticles against the surface region of the oncogenic receptor, EGFR, which is overexpressed in many forms of solid tumors. Selection of the linear epitope for creating \u201cplastic antibodies\u201d against the receptor was performed by analysis of a three-dimensional structure of the protein. The obtained \u201cplastic antibodies\u201d were specific against the epitope of EGFR. These plastic antibodies when loaded with a genotoxic drug, doxorubicin, were able to specifically induce cell death of breast cancer cell lines that overexpress the EGFR receptor. Experiments in vivo using xenografts of breast cancer cell lines pre-incubated with these plastic antibodies in nude mice showed that they have a pronounced therapeutic effect. Furthermore, since the commercial drug, Cetuximab, recognizes an epitope of EGFR, different from the one recognized by our plastic antibodies, it is likely that the latter may increase the efficacy of the commercial monoclonal antibody. Collectively, we demonstrate that the rationally designed small molecules can be potent and specific drugs for anti-cancer therapy.",

     "publication date": "11-2015",
     "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that high-dose chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) led to a profound and long-lasting state of immunodeficiency characterized by persisting low levels of T cells in hemoblastosis patients. Well-timed T-cell reconstitution is crucial for early restoration of anti-infectious and anti- tumor immune response. Lymphocyte recovery is mediated through the two main mechanisms \u2013 a homeostatic proliferation of T cells and generation of new naive T cells via thymopoiesis. It is known, that homeostatic proliferation is important for the restoration of T cell count in immune competent host during the 1st year following AHSCT. Thymus begins to fill up T cell repertoire approximately from the 6th month following AHSCT.We have investigated dynamics of CD4+FOXP3+ Treg recovery following AHSCT and possible relationship between Tregs and clinical outcomes since the suppressive activity of Tregs under lymphopenic conditions may influence on peripheral expansion of T cells. Thymic activity following AHSCT has been evaluated by measuring amounts of CD4+ CD45RA+CD31+ na\u00efve T cells, i.e. \u201crecent thymic emigrants\u201d (RTEs).109 patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas, Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and multiple myeloma underwent AHSCT in 2009\u20132014. The content of circulating CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs and CD4+CD45RA+CD31+ T cells was evaluated using flow cytometry before AHSCT, at the day of engraftment, and following 6 and 12\u00a0months.Pre-transplant count of CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs was significantly higher compared to healthy controls (5.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 vs 3.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9%; pU\u00a0=\u00a00.011; here and below data presented as Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD). Percentage of Tregs restored rapidly and reached initially high level at the time of engraftment, and then subsequently decreased within a year until it lowered to healthy donors\u2018 values. CD4+FOXP3+ Tregs at the time of engraftment were increased in patients with relapse or progression of disease within 6 and 12\u00a0months following AHSCT compared to non-relapsed patients (11.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1 vs 6.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0%; pU\u00a0=\u00a00.016, and 10.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 vs 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8%; pU\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Pre-transplant count of CD4+CD45RA+CD31+ T cells was significantly lower compared to healthy controls (17.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4 vs 30.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.2%, pU\u00a0=\u00a00.0005) and did not reach donors\u2018 values following 12\u00a0month (23.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.5%, pU\u00a0=\u00a00.032). Relapsed patients had the same quantity of RTEs as the patients with remission within the 1st year following AHSCT. There was no any significant association between RTEs and Tregs counts.Surprisingly, we have found high levels of circulating CD4+CD45RA- T cells co-expressing CD31 molecule in patients before AHSCT, since this molecule is infrequent on memory subsets in healthy controls (20.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.0 vs 8.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1%,pU\u00a0<\u00a00.00001). Relative amount of CD4+CD45RA-CD31+ T cells highly correlated with CD4+CD45RO+CD31+ population (rS=0.72; p\u00a0<\u00a00.00001). The count of CD4+CD45RA-CD31+ T cells recovered intensively and reached the pre-transplant level within the 1st month following AHSCT, and remained at the same level throughout the follow-up. There were no any differences in relative count of CD4+CD45RA-CD31+ T cells between patients with early relapse and remission during the 1st post-transplant year.Our data of Tregs reconstitution may confirm the earlier assumption that the presence of Tregs during the period of immune recovery preserves optimal T cell receptors diversity. However, the excess of these cells leads to the inhibition of proliferative activity and immune response and is associated with early relapse. Conversely, relatively slow recovery of RTEs determines theirlack of influence on survival within the 1st post-transplant year.The biological role and the way of appearance of CD31 molecule on T cell memory subset (CD4+CD45RA- and/or CD4+CD45RO+) still remain unclear. Further studies are required to enlighten the role of CD31+ memory T cells on lymphoproliferative disorders pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) remains one of the most important gastrointestinal cancers worldwide. The incidence and mortality rate from GC in Russia is higher in comparison with other European countries and USA. It should be noted that riskometry for the GC doesn\u2019t exist. Parallel assessment of pepsinogen I (PG I), pepsinogen II (PG II), PG I/PG II ratio and gastrin-17 (G-17), as well as antibodies to Helicobacter pylori is an exact and validated set of stomach-specific biomarkers that reflect the extent and grade of gastric atrophy as a main premalignant condition for GC.To study the diagnostic and predicting value of biomarkers of atrophic gastritis (AG) in retro-prospective cohort case-control study in Siberian population.General population sample was surveyed in Novosibirsk in 2003\u20132005 (10.000 subjects aged 45\u201369\u00a0years). Each serum sample was deeply frozen and stored. In 2008 and 2012 this database was compared with the data of the Population Cancer Registry. As a result of cross-sectional analysis of two databases 60 novel cases of GC were identified until 2011. For each case of GC, an appropriate control case was selected at the ratio 1:2 matching the area of residence, sex and age. Finally, 156 serum samples (52 \u2013 GC group and 104 \u2013 control group) were available for the analysis using a panel of serum biomarkers \u201cGastropanel\u201d (Biohit, Finland). Criteria for \u201cGastropanel\u201d in the diagnosis of AG were used: PG I <30\u03bcg/l, PG II <3\u03bcg/l, the ratio PG I/PG II <3, the level of basal G-17<1\u00a0pmol/l, and the presence of antibodies to H. pylori.Mean level of biomarkers did not differ between those with, and without GC, with the exception for PG I/PGII ratio, which was significantly lower in GC group. Indicators of gastric atrophy (OR; 95% CI) were associated with GC for PG I (2.9; 1.3\u20136.4), PG II (9.0; 1.8\u201344.3), and PG I/PG II (3.3; 1.5\u20137.3), but neither for G-17 (0.7, 0.4\u20131.6), nor for the presence of antibodies to H. pylori (0.4; 0.1\u20131.3). Multivariate regression analysis including sex, age of the patients, all biomarkers of \u201cGastropanel\u201d confirmed PG I and PGI/PGII ratio as the most powerful indicators in the model. Atrophy Index (AI) was calculated as a sum of abnormal parameters of gastric atrophy (PG I, PG I/PG II ratio and G-17, see Table, \u2217p\u00a0<\u00a00.019; \u2217\u2217p\u00a0<\u00a00.006).

     "abstract": "Methylation systems in the cells play an important role in the metabolic processes such as purine nucleotide biosynthesis and gene and protein activity regulation. An imbalance between entities in folic acid metabolism can adversely affect nucleotide synthesis and the DNA repair and methylation system, which can cause genome instability and impairments in chromosome segregation, and lead to abnormal expression of proto-oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. These processes may underlie the development of a range of cancer disease, including Non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas (NHL). Quite a few studies investigating the association of SNPs in the folate-metabolizing genes with NHL risk in populations of different ethnic origin are available to date. Because the low prevalence of this disease makes sampling difficult, most of these studies have small sizes, which may be one of the reasons why results obtained are often conflicting.The aim of this study was to investigate the role of some SNPs in folate genes (the C677T and A1298C SNPs in the MTHFR gene, A2756G in MTR, A66G in SHMT1, G1958A in MTHFD1 and 844ins68 in CBS) in genetic susceptibility to non-Hodgkin\u2019s malignant lymphoma in the west-Siberian region.146 unrelated patients from the Haematological Center (Novosibirsk city) with various types of NHL were investigated. Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes in venous blood and from buccal epithelium, using the standard methods of DNA separation. A PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay was used to detect the MTHFD1 G1958A and CBS 844ins68 SNPs. Genotyping of the MTHFR, MTR, MTRR and SHMT1 gene SNPs was carried out by real-time PCR allelic discrimination with TaqMan probes. The alleles and genotypes distribution of SNPs in patients were compared with their distribution in healthy white Russian subjects from Novosibirsk.We determined the allele and genotype frequencies for seven SNPs in folate metabolism in NHL and control groups. For all these SNPs, the genotype frequencies were in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium in the control group. There were no statistically significant differences in the frequencies of alleles and genotypes of polymorphic loci of MTHFR, MTRR, CBS, SHMT1 genes between patients with NHL and controls. However, theG1958A MTHFD1 polymorphism showed a significant association with aggressive NHL. The 1958A allele (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.578, C.I. [0.415\u20130.805], p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and AA MTHFD1 genotype (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.283, C.I. [0.130\u20130.613], p\u00a0<\u00a00.0008) were associated with decreased risk of aggressive lymphoma. The association between folate genes and indolent non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma was not revealed. The SNP G1958A causes the Arg653Gln substitution occurring in the formyltetrahydrofolate domain of the MTHFD enzyme. The substrate for this enzyme is tetrahydrofolate (THF). Potentially, the accumulation of THF results in an increase in 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate concentration, which in turn may enhance the efficiency of thymidylate synthesis and DNA methylation. Together, these processes may contribute to inhibition of malignant transformation.G1958A SNP in the MTHFD1 gene contributes to susceptibility to NHL. The mutant allele and genotype determine the protective effect, probably, by affecting the concentration of intracellular folic acid metabolites.",

     "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy in the lower lip. Although lower lip squamous cell carcinoma is slow growing, up to 29% of tumors develop metastases to the cervical lymph nodes. Thus, identification of biological markers that could provide prognostic information about the invasive or metastatic potential of these lesions is important. It is known that angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and proliferation play an important role in tumor progression. Therefore, the goal of this study was to analyze the immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, CD34 and Podoplanin in hyperkeratosis and in squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip. It was intended to assess the possibility of using such markers as indicators of morphological aggressiveness of squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip (LLSCC).Seventy-one cases of the lower lip lesions, obtained from the files of Novosibirsk Regional Oncology Center were selected for this study. The specimens were divided into three groups: a lower lip hyperkeratosis group consisting of 22 cases; LLSCC with keratinization consisting of 34 cases and LLSCC without keratinization consisting of 15 cases. To analyze angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and proliferation, we performed immunostains of the lower lip biopsy material for the CD34, vascular marker, Podoplanin, lymphatic-specific markers and Ki-67, marker of proliferation. Tissue samples were fixed in 10% neutral formalin, processed by standard histological techniques and embedded in paraffin. All steps of the immunohistochemical reaction were performed by using BENCHMARK/XT slide stainer (Ventana). The lymphatic and blood vessels volume density and Ki-67 cells numerical density were morphometrically analyzed in all groups and compared using the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test. A level of significance of 5% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was adopted for all tests.All cases of a lower lip hyperkeratosis and LLSCC were positive for Ki-67, CD34 and Podoplanin. With respect to the pattern of staining, specimens exhibited a predominantly peripheral staining for CD34 and Podoplanin in inflammatory infiltrates and tumor sites. In contrast, staining for Ki-67 was predominantly central in inflammatory infiltrates and tumor sites in hyperkeratosis and LLSCC. When compared to lower lip hyperkeratosis, LLSCC (both with keratinization and without keratinization) showed a higher number of immunopositive Ki-67 cells (by 64% and 77%, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). It was found that proliferative activity of tumor cells in LLSCC with keratinization was 2 times higher than that in LLSCC without keratinization. Comparison of the volume density of blood vessels showed that the density of CD34+ \u2013 blood vessels in hyperkeratosis was lower by 77% than in LLSCC without keratinization and lower by 64% than in LLSCC with keratinization. At the same time, volume density of blood vessels in LLSCC without keratinization was higher by 56% than that in LLSCC with keratinization. Investigation of lymphatic vessels showed that Podoplanin+ \u2013 lymphatic vessels volume density in hyperkeratosis was lower by 50% than that in LLSCC without keratinization and lower by 24% than that in LLSCC with keratinization. Whereas in LLSCC without keratinization the lymphatic vessels volume density was higher by 51% than that in LLSCC with keratinization.This study has shown the greater development of blood and lymphatic vessels in LLSCC without keratinization in comparison with hyperkeratosis and LLSCC with keratinization, thus contributing to the development of metastasis.",

     "abstract": "The work describes advantages of our latest instrument developments in flow cytometry and microscopy. Characteristics of newly launched flow cytometer, which uses acoustic focusing to align the cells in the focus of the laser for analysis, allows to analyze samples at a much higher throughput rate without losing precision and sensitivity. This opens up new possibilities regarding sample preparation and analysis. These advantages we want to demonstrate on 2 examples, whole blood analysis and rare event analysis. Analysis of biological samples in the most physiologic state with minimal sample preparation and manipulation is a key objective to any workflow. However as whole blood samples generally require significant manipulation, such as wash/centrifugation steps and/or red blood cell lysis, we have developed multiple no-lyse, no-wash assays to minimize these manipulation steps to obtain more physiological results. Here we show how we utilize the rapid sample collection capabilities of the our instrument to characterize phagocyte function in human whole blood with a phagocytosis/phagosome acidification assay and also a dihydrorhodamine 123 superoxide production assay, in a no-lyse, no wash format.Another area where our technology can shift boundaries is the field of rare event analysis. Due to the low frequency of the target cell population a large number of total events (in the range of several millions) need to be acquired. Simply due to the enormous amount of data that needs to be acquired, time becomes a very limiting factor for rare event analysis. As Acoustic Focusing allows analyzing samples at an approximately 10\u00d7 higher throughput rate without scarifying data quality and maintaining a low coincidence rate, it pushes the limits what can be done in this field. As an example we will show the characterization of human iNKT cells.In addition to flow cytometry we want to show how modern microscopes help to perform a variety of routine and specialty applications.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells display altered methylation signatures distinguishing them from normal cells. Originating from all tissues and cells of the body cell-free DNA (cfDNA) including aberrantly methylated DNA reflect epigenetic aberrations occurs not only in tumor cells but also in tumor microenvironment. Actually, aberrantly methylated cfDNA has proved to be a promising biomarker for noninvasive detection of cancer with several clinically-certified tests (Epi-pro Colon\u00ae, Epi-pro Lung\u00ae, Cologuard\u00ae). However only one test (Epi-pro Colon\u00ae) uses blood plasma \u2013 the most convenient source of cfDNA. Input of tissue and age specific methylation along with unidentified reasons lead to the presence of molecules with every conceivable cytosine-methylation patterns which decrease probability of tumor DNA identification. Among numerous variants of cfDNA methylation patterns only few reflect cancer related changes. To identify those tumor-specific profiles single nucleotide resolution of methylated cytosine locations in the individual circulating DNA molecules is obviously required.We performed target bisulfite sequencing of potential prostate cancer (PC) cfDNA markers (GSTP1; RNF219) isolated from blood plasma of 18 healthy donors (HD), 17 benign hyperplasia (BPH) and 20 PC patients using MiSeq platform (Illumina). RNF219 gene was shown to have high diagnostic potential in our previous comparative study of cfDNA from HD, PC and BHP patients using HCGI12k microarrays (Cortese, et al., 2012). GSTP1 is a common pathological DNA methylation event in PC and is most widely studied and promising methylation marker in the cfDNA of PC patients (Wu, et al., 2011).Selected loci were amplified after bisulfite conversion (Zymo Research) of cfDNA with methyl-independent barcoded primers and sequenced with coverage ranging from 23509 to 143953. Identification of CpG methylation status in DNA fragments was performed with the BiQ Analyzer HT Software. All statistical analysis was performed using R Statistical Software (version 3.1.1) To reveal diagnostically significant differences, several approaches to data analysis were used. Conventional approach is a prediction of patient\u2019s diagnosis based on differences in methylation level of CpG-sites. Another approach used in this study relies on discrimination of cancer-related correlation between methylation statuses of CpG-sites within individual molecules of cfDNA \u2013 Intramolecular Correlation of Methylation Statuses (ICoMS).Study population was randomly subsampled into training and test cohorts. The logit regression model based on methylation level of CpG-sites achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) exceeding 0.94 in both cohorts for GSTP1 gene and 0.81 \u2013 for RNF219 gene. A novel approach to identify diagnostic significance of cfDNA methylation was based on comparison of correlation matrices (pairwise phi coefficient between methylation statuses of CpG sites) for HD, BHP and PC groups. Binomial regression models with LASSO penalization were used to predict patient\u2019s diagnosis. ROC curves for fitted models show AUC, specificity and sensitivity as 0.99, 100% and 92% for GSTP1 gene and 0.99, 100% and 90% for RNF219 (test cohort).The ICoMS approach estimates diagnostic value of target genes and reveals cancer-related cytosine methylation. That could potentially input in gene expression, identify the features of tumor physiology and on a par with conventional approaches provide helpful information for rational design of noninvasive, methylation-specific cfDNA-based diagnostics for PC.Moreover, the planned further evaluation of relationship between the revealed correlations associated with cancer and tumor biology could increase the basic knowledge of carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer ranks the first among female oncological diseases and ranks the second after lung cancer among causes of cancer related deaths. Use of contemporary anticancer drugs significantly enhanced possibilities of cancer therapy. However, most of medicines against cancer have such disadvantages as toxicity, narrowness of therapeutic action, and emergence of drug resistance. Recently, an approach based on potential of dendritic cells (DCs) to induce formation of cytotoxic T-cell immune response against cancer cells is widely used. Priming of dendritic cells by DNA-constructs encoding immunogenic epitopes of tumor antigens is regarded as a rather promising approach to design cancer vaccines. The aim of this study is to construct, obtain and study expression in eukaryotic cells of recombinant plasmid \u2013 candidate DNA-vaccines inducing T-cell immune response against breast cancer.Using the PolyCTLDesigner software, DNA-vaccine construct was made encoding polyepitope T-cell immunogen BC-A\u22170201. Gene encoding target immunogen was synthesized and cloned in the composition of plasmid pcDNA3.1 that is eukaryotic expression vector. Accuracy of gene insertion encoding polyepitopeimmunogen was verified using restriction analysis. Obtained target plasmid pBC-A\u22170201 \u2013 candidate DNA-vaccine was used for evaluation of gene expression in transfected eukaryotic cells 293T and dendritic cells by means of flow cytofluorometry and immunohistochemistry using MAT to p24 epitope-marker inserted into the structure of target plasmid. Dendritic cells were obtained from peripheral blood precursors by 2-h plastic adhesion. The nonadherent cells were removed 2\u00a0h later and the adherent monolayer was cultivated in the medium containing growth factors (GM-CSF and IL-4) according to (Naik, 2010; Ganul and Khranovskaya, 2012). Transfection of immature DCs (iDC) was performed by using the reagents purchased from Promokine. Further cultivation of iDCs was carried out in the medium containing TNF- \u03b1 to obtain fully mature DCs (mDC). Analysis of mDCsurface markers expression was made using MAO (HLA-DR, CD83, CD86) and flow cytofluorometer (BD FACSCalibur).Plasmid pBC-A\u22170201 encoding epitopes of breast cancer antigens was constructed and produced in preparative amount. Using the method of intracellular staining of product of expression by specific MAO 29F2 to epitope p24, we showed expression of gene BC-A\u22170201 in eukaryotic cells 293T and dendritic cells transfected by plasmid pBC-A\u22170201. Maturity of dendritic cells was also proved.Thus, obtained candidate DNA-vaccine encoding target polyepitopeimmunogen provides synthesis of relevant protein in the eukaryotic cells culture. In future, we plan to study biological activity of DNA-vaccine to evaluate level of induction of cytotoxic response against SKBR3 breast cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "Differently sized microparticles, including exosomes (30\u2013100\u00a0nm), prostasomes (50\u2013500\u00a0nm), oncosomes (50\u2013500\u00a0nm) and other microparticles (100\u20131000\u00a0nm) were found in blood and urine. Exosomes from prostate cancer (PCa) patients can potentially contain cancer-specific nucleic acids, and thus can represent a valuable source of diagnostic material. In this study, we have investigated microvesicles and miRNA from urine of healthy donors and PCa patients. To isolate miRNAs from urine and microparticles, novel methods for miRNA isolation were elaborated (Rus. patent application No 2014137763, priority date 17.09.2014). The study population included 14 patients with PCa (63\u201382\u00a0years, T2-3NxMx1) and control group of 20 healthy volunteers with no previous history of prostate disease (48\u201373\u00a0years). Urine was clarified by two serial centrifugations at 400g, 20\u00a0\u00b0C, 20\u00a0min and at 17000g, 20\u00a0\u00b0C, 20\u00a0min. Microparticles were precipitated from the resulting supernatant by high-speed centrifugation at 100000g, 18\u00a0\u00b0C, 90\u00a0min, the pellet was resuspended and pelleted by centrifugation under the same conditions. To isolate exosomes, total microparticles were filtered through 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm pore filters and reprecipitated. The resulting pellets were resuspended and exosome samples were investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). MiRNAs were isolated by one-step single-phase protocol and purified using \u201cBioSilica\u201d spin- columns (Zaporozhchenko et al., Anal. Biochem, upcoming, doi: 10.1016/j.ab.2015.03.028) and by recently developed method based on precipitation of excess biopolymers, allowing to isolate miRNAs with better efficiency than commercially available kits. The size and quantity assessment of extracellular RNA were performed using capillary electrophoresis system on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Concentrations of miRNAs (miR19b, miR25, miR205, miR125b, miR126) were measured by qRT-PCR and normalized to miR-16 using dCq method.TEM demonstrated the presence of 20\u2013300\u00a0nm microparticles in urine of healthy donors and PCa patients. Approximately 50\u201370% of all urine microparticles are represented by 30\u2013100\u00a0nm exosomes and residual 30\u201350% by particles larger than 100\u00a0nm. (The pool of urine microvesicles consists of 50\u201370% exosomes and 30\u201350% particles larger than 100\u00a0nm.).The major part of extracellular RNA found both in exosomes and total microparticles fraction of healthy donors and patients with PCa, is 25\u2013200\u00a0nt long and can include tRNA (73\u201393\u00a0n.), 5.8 rRNA (\u223c150 n.), snoRNK (10\u201320 n.), snRNA (60\u2013300\u00a0n.) piRNAs (29\u201330 n.), miRNAs (20\u201325 n.), siRNA (21\u201325 n.). Concentration of extracellular urine RNA in exosomes and total microparticles of healthy donors and patients with PCa amounts to100\u00a0pg/ml of urine on average.Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of all miRNAs in samples isolated from total urine did not demonstrate any diagnostic significance. In contrast, in training cohort concentration of miR-19b in exosomes and total microparticles fraction provide 95%/75% and 93%/100% sensitivity and specificity, respectively.Thus, microparticles, isolated from urine of PCa patients represent a valuable source of diagnostically significant miRNAs. To investigate miR-19b, a large testing cohort is required. Search for other potential miRNA-markers by microarray profiling of cell-free miRNA isolated from urine of PCa patients is also required to reveal a sold set of markers for confident PCa diagnostics.",

     "abstract": "According to the \u201cimmune-editing\u201d theory, immunocompetent cells being important component of the tumor microenvironment can both show antitumor activity and contribute to the tumor progression. Tumor pathophysiological features affect the structural and functional changes of certain components of tumor microenvironment, in particular, increase the number of T-lymphocytes with regulatory activity (Treg). FOXP3, transcription factor, acts as master regulator for suppressive function of Treg. Recent studies have shown FOXP3 is expressed both in immunocompetent cells and tumor cells; however, the function of this gene in malignant tumors of different genesis is ambiguous (GirdhariLal, et al., 2014). The aim of the study was quantitative assessment of subpopulations CD4+, CD8+, FOXP3+-lymphocytes associated with the tumor, FOXP3+-tumor cells and comparison of these parameters with the clinical and morphological characteristics of endometrial cancer (EC).A total of 40 EC patients who did not receive special treatment before surgery with the mean age 56.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8\u00a0years were included in the study. Morphological and immunohistochemical methods were used in the study (primary monoclonal antibodies: CD4 \u2013 clone 4B12, \u201cMillipore\u201d, USA, CD8 \u2013 clone RIV \u2013 11, \u201cMillipore\u201d, USA, FOXP3 \u2013 clone 5H5L12, \u201cInvitrogen\u201d, USA, Ki-67 - clone MIB1, \u201cDakoCytomation\u201d, Denmark) and Real-Time PCR was also used to determine the DNA methylation status of FOXP3 gene mathematical statistics.The dependence of the number of intratumoral CD4+-, CD8+- lymphocytes and FOXP3-lymphocytes on such biological characteristics as the degree of differentiation, growth rate and depth of invasion into the myometrium was established. In endometrial adenocarcinomas, low grade content of FOXP3+ lymphocytes increased (27.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6%), number of intratumoral CD4+ (15,3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00,2%), CD8+-lymphocytes (29.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3%) and FOXP3+-tumor cells (15,5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03,3%) decreased in contrast to the same parameters in high grade tumors: FOXP3+-lymphocytes (17.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0%), CD4+ (52.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7%), CD8+ (46.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6%), FOXP3+-tumor cells (27.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6%), p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. DNA analysis of endometrial tumor showed that FOXP3 gene promoter was methylated in 71% of cases. The number of cases with positive methylation status was increasing with lower differentiation grade, that was associated with the low number of FOXP3+-tumor cells. Statistically significant correlation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) (Spearman rank correlation) was observed between the deep invasion of tumor in myometrium and the number of FOXP3+-tumor cells (R\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.63), number of FOXP3+- and CD4+-lymphocytes (R\u00a0=\u00a00.68 andR\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.55, respectively) as well as the level of tumor proliferative activity (R\u00a0=\u00a00.74).Quantitative changes of some components of the tumor microenvironment such as CD4+-, CD8+-, FOXP3+-lymphocytes and content of FOXP3+-tumor cells correlate with the biological characteristics of EC and apparently have a significant role in the progression of this cancer.",

Data about lifestyle, food preferences, smoking history were obtained from the questionnaire (n\u00a0=\u00a035). All clinical samples were tested by AmpliSens HPV diagnostic kits (Russia) to determine prevalence of 12 high risk HPV types. Statistical analysis was performed using Kaplan\u2013Meier method, Cox regression, Gehan test, Fisher test, Mann\u2013Whitney and Kruskal\u2013Wallis tests.Gender, age, smoking status, alcohol consumption, distance from harmful factors, professional hazards and duration of its exposure as well as tumor criteria such as T, N, G, the presence of keratinization, invasion into the underlying tissues, HPV-infection, chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and response to the treatment were assessed for HNC patients. It was shown that the two-year survival rate was about 70%, and the five-year survival rate was about 32%. There was strong correlation between decreased overall survival and increased alcohol consumption (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) as well as regional lymph nodes status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Patients with early tumor stages and N0 lymph node status as well as patients receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy showed trend towards to better survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09, p\u00a0=\u00a00.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.09, respectively). Overall survival of patients with lymph node metastasis was higher in case of early tumor stages (p\u00a0=\u00a00.08) and in patients who had no alcohol consumption history (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06). Cox regression analysis was used to obtain the model describing overall survival of patients. The model with the highest level of significance includes 3 factors-nodal metastases, the presence of keratinization and radiotherapy. It was shown that the risk of death was 4.2 and 2.6-fold higher in case of lymph node metastases and keratinized cancer, and 2.7-fold lower in case of radiotherapy. It was also shown that metastasis occurred more frequently in cases with invasion into the underlying tissue of a primary tumor (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and in cases with a low tissue grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Association of alcohol consumption with questionnaire data was studied. It was shown that men\u2019s preferably smokers consume alcohol more often than other patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02, respectively). Our data showed that HPV prevalence was higher in smokers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), and in patients with early tumor stages (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). Furthermore, response to radiotherapy was better in HPV-positive patients compared to HPV-negative cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09). Better response to radiotherapy showed the group of patients who received dose higher than 45 Gy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and who had no lymph node metastases(p\u00a0=\u00a00.05).Our data showed that metastasis to lymph nodes and alcohol consumption are the main factors that affect mortality in HNC patients of Tomsk region.",

     "abstract": "Risk of metastasis formation is provided by both tumor cell biological characteristics and the microenvironment features within the primary tumor along with local and systemic conditions for metastatic niche formation. The inflammatory infiltration has been shown to strongly impact on tumor progression (Whiteside, 2013). Dronca et al. (2011) showed that immunosuppressive factors in the tumor microenvironment may impair not only local immune responses but also disturb systemic immunity. Zitvogel et al. anticipate that the comprehension of the mechanisms governing the immunogenicity of cell death will have a profound impact on the design of anticancer therapies.To study the impact of immune system on clinical response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients.350 patients with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were enrolled into the study. The procedures were made in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. Clinical response to chemotherapy, the 5-year metastasis-free survival and all major clinical and morphological parameters were determined. The original method of multidimensional data visualization was applied to present the immune system state as integral entirety in visual image for classification of patients with different risk of metastasis (NovoSpark Corporation, Canada). Copy number aberrations (CNA) of cytokine gene regions in tumor specimens were tested using high-density microarray platform CytoScanTM HD Array (Affymetrix, USA). Cytokine gene polymorphism was analyzed. Subpopulations of lymphocytes and macrophages were determined within the primary tumors by IHC.We found, that favorable clinical immediate response to preoperative chemotherapy was related to the high levels of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-10 production by peripheral mononuclear cells before the treatment. This correlation was further confirmed by data from the study on association between cytokine gene functional polymorphism and response to NAC. We used NovoSpark Corporation visualization approach allowing the representation the immune system state as integral unit and to discriminate breast cancer patients with high and low risk of haematogeneic metastasis. When estimated before cancer treatment, 95% of breast cancer patients had risk of metastasis. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical tumor removal reduced the risk of tumor progression to 62\u201371%. However, in a year after adjuvant chemo- and radiotherapy, the patient group with high risk of metastases increased to 81% again. Thus, the cancer treatment can change the primarily estimated outcome prognosis in breast cancer patients, and the monitoring of immune system is a promising approach to predict the risk of cancer progression or resistance to the therapy. We have found the connection between the profile of intra-tumor inflammatory elements and chemotherapy efficacy.Cytokine gene expression may be influenced by the chromosome anomalies (CNA \u2013 Copy Number Aberration) \u2013 deletion and amplification \u2013 of cytokine gene loci in tumor cells. We found the close relation between the clinical response to NAC and gain of function of IL-10 and CHI3L1 (YKL40) genes. In contrast, loss of TNF-alpha and IL-17 gene function due to corresponding CNA was associated with good response to NAC. Metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients was shown to be closely related to CNA.The parameters of the activation of systemic and intra-tumoral immune system by growing tumor and its dissemination have to be validated in order to identify the new prognostic markers for the efficiency of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "The strong connection between cancer-related inflammation and tumour development with pattern \u2013 recognizing receptors (PRRs) activation results in identification of new target molecules that could lead to improved cancer diagnosis and treatment. TLR3, RIG1 and MDA5 synthetic ligand poly(I:C) was shown to trigger apoptosis in cancer cells. However, TLR3 signaling also includes NF-kB transcription factor which has emerged as endogenous tumour promoter via stimulation of pro-inflammatory tumour microenvironment, enhancement of angiogenesis, tumour cell proliferation and metastasis. Thus down regulation of NF-kB-mediated effects after TLR3 activation is needed for implementation of TLR3 ligand-based therapy into clinical trials.We have earlier demonstrated that DNA and sequence specific ODNs inhibit poly(I:C)-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human primary fibroblasts and endothelial cells (Cherepanova et al., Immunobiology, 2013). Using these specific ODNs and affinity modification/isolation approach combined with subsequent MALDI-TOF the main cellular targets for these ODNs were identified as Ku protein \u2013 heterodimer of KU70 and KU80 (Cherepanova et al., Exp. Opin. Biol. Ther., 2012).The goals of this study are to reveal whether the ODNs target poly(I:C)-induced activation in tumour cells: cervical carcinoma (Hela) and epidermoid carcinoma (A431) and to confirm Ku protein involvement in the observed effect. Poly(I:C) was shown to activate IL-6 production in Hela and A431 cells, and specific ODNs inhibit this activation with comparable efficacy as in primary cells. ODNs decrease both IL-6 concentration and mRNA expression rate in poly(I:C)-activated cells, indicating that NF-kB activation is also impaired.To reveal whether Ku protein is involved in the inhibiting effect of ODNs, Ku70 level in Hela cells was reduced by siRNA, which were shown to inhibit the expression of Ku70 by up to 70%. Inhibiting efficacy of ODN is almost twice lower in Ku70 knock-down cells as compared to control siRNA, indicating that ODN binding to Ku protein is important for the inhibition. Whether Ku is directly involved in nucleic acid pattern recognition or have auxiliary functions, mediating ODN localization or poly(I:C)-proteins interactions, remains to be investigated. Nevertheless, efficient NF-kB pathway targeting by specific ODNs may improve dsRNA-based cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "To research the characteristics of the inflammation immune disorders and cell destruction at the local level in the lacrimal and intraocular liquids in patients with choroidal melanoma.Investigation of concentration of the cytokines interleukin (IL) IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, autoantibodies to antigens of native DNA (AAB to Ag of nDNA) in the lacrimal and intraocular liquids was performed in 36 patients (72 eyes) aged 34\u201383\u00a0years. The mean age of the study group patients was 60.45\u00a0years (15 males and 21 females). As standard indicators, survey results of 20 \u201chealthy\u201d donor lacrimal liquid \u2013 volunteers were used. For statistical data processing, descriptive statistics and methods of inter-group comparisons were used. Quantitative characteristics are presented as the median (25, 75 percentile). For comparison of quantitative traits, regression analysis was used. P value of <0.05 considered significant (95% confidence interval). Statistical analysis was performed using the software R (Team RC, 2013).A significant positive relation of concentration of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, AAB to Ag of nDNA in lacrimal liquid of eye with choroidal melanoma and paired \u201chealthy\u201d eye was reveled (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Concentrations of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and AAB to Ag of nDNA in the lacrimal liquid of the eye with choroidal melanoma were significantly higher as compared with the levels of the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The level concentration of IL-4 in lacrimal liquid in eye with choroidal melanoma was significantly low (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The level concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in the early (T1\u2013T2) than in the later stages (T3\u2013T4) of choroidal melanoma development (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). All stages of choroidal melanoma were characterized by higher level of IL-6, compared with the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Given the role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of malignant diseases, the activity may be indicative of tumor progression in the early stages of development of choroidal melanoma. A significant increase in IL-10 was shown at stages T1 and T4 compared with the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Regression analysis revealed a significant positive relation of concentration of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, AAB to Ag of nDNA between lacrimal liquid and intraocular liquids of the eye with choroidal melanoma (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).IL-4 r\u00a0=\u00a00,84 (0.58; 1.47), p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 IL-6 r\u00a0=\u00a00.98 (0.64; 1.32), p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 IL-8 r\u00a0=\u00a00.82 (0.12; 1.73), p\u00a0=\u00a00.05 IL-10 r\u00a0=\u00a00.84 (0.01; 1.81), p\u00a0=\u00a00.05AAB to Ag of nDNA r\u00a0=\u00a00.79 (0.36; 1.25), p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.1.It was established that in the pathogenesis of choroidal melanoma, local Inflammation plays an important role as evidenced by a significant high concentration of IL-6, IL-8 due to lower levels of IL-4 and expressed immune disorders, cell destruction, as evidenced by significantly high level of AAB to Ag of nDNA, compared with the control group. 2.Use of lacrimal liquid is suitable for the study of the inflammation, immune disorders and cell destruction at the local level in patients with choroidal melanoma. 3.Significant increase in IL-6 level in lacrimal liquid was observed for all stages of choroidal melanoma, however, it was more pronounced in early stages (T1\u2013T2), than in later stages (T3\u2013T4). 4.A significant increase in IL-10 may indicate the severity of the local immunosuppression induced by tumor growth in the mechanisms of choroidal melanoma. A significant positive relationship between the concentrations of IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, AAB to Ag of nDNA in the lacrimal liquids of eye and paired \u201chealthy\u201d eye was found in patients with choroidal melanoma.",

     "abstract": "IGF signaling pathway plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and survival. Deregulation of this pathway has been frequently identified in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). IGF signaling pathway consists of IGF ligands (IGF-I and IGF-II), IGF binding proteins (IGFBP 1-7), and membrane-bound IGF receptors (IGF-1R, IGF-II/M6PR, and IGF-2R). The insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) have several functions, such as IGF transporting, accumulation of IGF at the specific cell pools, inhibition and activation of ligand\u2013receptor interaction. Furthermore, the Igfbps may act independently of IGF-pathway.Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) was used for induction of hepatic tumorigenesis. The male mice, 2\u00a0weeks old, were injectedintraperitoneally with 20\u00a0mg/kg body weight of DEN. The liver tissue samples were collected 4, 6, 8, 12\u00a0months after injection. We performed a comprehensive histological analysis of all kinds of liver samples: tumors, tumor surrounding tissue and normal tissue. Dysplasia was observed 4\u00a0months after injection, at hepatocellular adenomas were identified 6\u20138\u00a0months after injection. In the experimental group, 100% of mice had multifocal HCC 12\u00a0months after injection. Evaluation of samples from the control group showed normal liver architecture and histology.Western blot analysis showed the presence the HCC tumor marker alfa-fetoprotein only in tumor samples. High levels of Igf-1R and FoxO3 proteins were observed in tumor tissue in contrast to the surrounding and normal tissues 12\u00a0months after injection. The expression profiles of Igfbp-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7, Igf-1R, FoxO3 were analyzed by real time PCR. The most significant results were observed 8 and 12\u00a0months after DEN injection. RT-PCR showed the dynamic increase in Igf-1R expression in tumor. Expression pattern of Igfbps has shown a high level of Igf-1,-2,-5,-6,-7 mRNA in surrounding tissue and Igfbp-1,-3,-5 in tumor compared to control. The expression of Igfbp-2,-4,-5,-6,-7 was up-regulated, whereas expression of Igfbp-1,-3 was down-regulated in surrounding tissue. The expression of Igfbp-4 was decreased in tumor samples. The expression levels of Igfbp-3,-4 in surrounding tissue and Igfbp-7 in tumor were the same as in the control. We detected high level of mRNA of FoxO3 in tumor.In conclusion, these data confirm previously existing assumption about paracrine effect of Igfbps on tumor growth and progression. Phosphorylation of FoxO3 protein may play an important role in survival of cancer cells. Our results showed up-regulation of Igfbp-2 and Igfbp-5 in tumor and tumor surrounding tissue. Igfbp-2 and Igfbp-5, well known activators of Igfs, can be pro-tumorigenic factors, which are important for hepatocarcinogenesis. Hence, therapeutic targeting of these proteins may offer options for intervention in human HCC.Project supported by Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Russia) No. (113-04-01459).",

It was shown that compared to norm levels of LPC, PC, PE fractions were reliable increased in BC and CC, when PI, PS, PA \u2013 decreased. Notably, regular disturbances reveled in BC and CC were identical with those observed earlier in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and also distinctly individual for each patient. We conclude that alterations in PLs content of crude MNC PMs have been associated with disease pathology and similarly involved in the onset and evolution of diverse forms of cancer.

     "abstract": "Opisthorchiasis is a form of foodborne trematodiasis which is caused by liver flukes. It has been shown that a chronic Opisthorchiasis infection increases a risk of cholagiocarcinoma of liver. It is commonly believed that a gradual change of homeostasis in a parasite microenvironment (bile) leads to liver fluke-induced cancer. Nevertheless, no systematic, analytically driven studies confirming this hypothesis have been published yet. The restricted access to clinical material and extreme complexity of the biological matrix (bile) both are the important \u201crate limiting factors\u201d for a progress in the field. Here we present for the first time a cross-platform mass spectrometric analysis of bile juice collected from the patients with cholangiocarcinoma-associated diseases. We show that an effective analysis of such complex biological matrix as bile juice requires a combination of orthogonal analytical platforms (e.g. RPLC\u2013MS and HILIC\u2013MS) maximizing coverage of the metabolic space.28 patients with O. felineus infection and 30 negative controls were included in the study. The infection status was confirmed using microscopy analysis of the bile. Bile samples were collected from the gallbladder using sterile puncture, directly frozen and stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C until analysis. The samples were randomized and organized into the acquisition blocks consisting of the samples and quality controls (QC). Experiments were carried out with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 LC system (Thermo Scientific/Dionex, The Netherlands) equipped with a Dual Gradient Separation pump allowing for parallel LC analysis, and hyphenated to an Impact UHR-qTOF mass analyzer (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Reversed-phase experiments (RPLC) were performed with an UHPLC BEH Shield RP18 column 100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02.1\u00a0mm, 1.7\u00a0\u03bcm (Waters) and HILIC experiments with a Luna HILIC column (Phenomenex, The Netherlands) of 100 \u00d7 2.00\u00a0mm, 3\u00a0\u03bc\u00a0m. RPLC data were acquired in ESI positive mode and HILIC in negative mode, respectively. The data acquisition rate was set to 1\u00a0Hz over a mass range of m/z 50\u20131000. The LC\u2013MS data files were aligned by using the in-house developed alignment algorithm MS-Align 2 tool (www.ms-utils.org/msalign2).After the data prepressing, which includes alignment, noise filtering and peak picking two data matrixes costing of 412 features (metabolites) for RPLC and 428 ones for HILIC were generated. To evaluate a degree of similarity between the two data matrixes the RV coefficient (a multivariate extension of correlation coefficient) was used. The coefficient has flattened at 0.58 showing that despite a strong overlap between the datasets there is a substantial number of the \u201cplatform specific\u201d metabolites. Those structures will certainly be missed if a single platform strategy is applied.Here we present for the first time a cross-platform mass spectrometric analysis of bile juice collected from the patients cholangiocarcinoma-associated diseases. We show that a combination of the two platforms greatly improves the coverage of the metabolome and as such should be a firstchoice for exploratory studies of the complex biological matrixes.Work was conducted with the application of the Tomsk regional common use center technical equipment acquired thanks to a grant of the Russian Ministry of the Agreement No. 14.594.21.0001 (RFMEFI59414X0001).

     "abstract": "Breast cancer, particularly invasive carcinoma of no special type (IC NST), demonstrates considerable intratumor morphological heterogeneity. Five types of morphological structures representing different architectural arrangements of tumor cells \u2013 tubular, alveolar, trabecular, solid structures, and discrete groups have been described in IC NST. Previous studies reported the contribution of intratumor morphological heterogeneity of IC NST to chemotherapy efficiency and lymph node metastasis (Zavyalova et al., 2013; Denisov et al., 2014); however, its role in distant metastasis remains unidentified. Aim: to study the contribution of intratumor morphological heterogeneity of IC NST to distant metastasis and to identify gene expression features of metastatic behavior of different morphological structures.358 IC NST patients (age range 29\u201390, mean age 49.8 \u00b1 9.5, T1-4N0-3M0-1) treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) have been enrolled in this study. Chi-square test and Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis were used to estimate the association between the presence of certain morphological structures in breast tumors and the frequency of distant metastasis and metastasis-free survival. qRT-PCR was applied for measurement of the expression levels of genes involved in cell motility (CDH1, CDH2, CDH3, CTNNA1, CTNNB1, ITGA6, ITGAV, ITGB1, ITGB3, ITGB4, SNAIL, MMP14, ROCK2, L1CAM, MMP2, MMP9, PDPN) and pre-metastatic niche formation (TNFa, TGFb, VEGFa, LOX, M-CSF, GM-CSF, HIF1A, SDF2) in different morphological structures isolated from breast tumors (n\u00a0=\u00a04) by laser microdissection.Patients with alveolar structures in breast tumors more frequently displayed distant metastasis than cases without this morphological variant (71.9% vs. 56.5%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The association between alveolar structures and high frequency of hematogenous metastasis was found only in patients with poor response to NAC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), but not in cases with good chemotherapy efficiency (p\u00a0=\u00a00.377). Increased distant metastasis was also shown in patients with trabecular structures as compared to cases without this morphological type (88.3% vs. 70.0%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly higher probability of developing metastasis in patients with alveolar or trabecular structures in breast tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011). No significant association between other morphological structures and distant metastasis was found. Expression analysis showed the presence of cell motility phenotype in all morphological structures. In particular, we found changes in cell adhesion gene expression, which declined in the row: solid\u2013alveolar\u2013trabecular structures\u2013discrete groups of tumor cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, almost all structures demonstrated SNAIL and ROCK2 gene expression, and there were differences in expression of other cell migration genes between morphological structures. For example, PDPN was observed to be expressed in solid and alveolar structures, whereas L1CAM \u2013 in trabecular, tubular structures and discrete groups of some breast tumors. The expression of pre-metastatic niche genes also varied between distinct structures and, in general, declined in the row: alveolar\u2013solid\u2013trabecular structures\u2013discrete groups of tumor cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Intratumor morphological heterogeneity of IC NST contributes to distant metastasis probably by variations in expression of genes involved in cell motility and pre-metastatic niche formation between different morphological structures.The study was supported by theRussian Scientific Foundation(Grant#14-15-00318).",

     "abstract": "Cystatins are natural endogenous inhibitors of cysteine proteases universally involved into development of different tumors. Tumor growth and metastazing include increased consumption of these inhibitors, followed by decreased level of cystatins and dysregulation of proteases/protease inhibitors system. However, the biological role of individual cystatins is still not clear. The most known cystatin C was shown to relate to some types of tumor development. Cystatins include a group of intracellular cystatins (belonging to type 1) and extracellular cystatins (type 2), among them cystatins C, D, E/M, F, G, S, SN and SA, which functions were not studied enough. It was suggested that cystatin SN was responsible in regulation of tumor growth locally.To investigate cystatin C and cystatin SN concentrations in biological fluids of patients with intraocular melanoma as tumor biomarkers and possible therapy targets.The patients with melanoma chorioidea (57 patients; among them woman 36, men 21; aged from 28 to 80, of middle age of 56.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4\u00a0years) were under investigation. In all cases the pathological process involved one eye. The control group consisted of 37 healthy persons (volunteers), medical personnel in clinic and students, aged from 20 to 49 years; the middle age 31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1\u00a0years); 7 patients with age-related cataract aged from 57 to 80 (middle age 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 years; man 3, woman 4). The biological fluids studied: tears, intraocular fluid (obtained during operation) and blood serum. In all cases investigation was made according to informed agreement of patients and control group members. Cystatins concentration was measured by ELISA kits: for Cystatin C (BioVendor, Chechia) and for cystatin SN with help of Human Cystatin SN (CST1) Elisa Kit Cusabio, China. Statistical analysis was made by non-parametric statistic test of Kruskal\u2013Wallis, for correlations \u2013 Spearman test. The difference between groups studied was considered significant p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.Increased serum level of cystatin C was revealed in patients with melanoma chorioides (1023.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a078.9\u00a0ng/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) compared with the control (809.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0146.8\u00a0ng/ml). In tears of patients with melanoma chorioidea, cystatin C concentration (441.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.5\u00a0ng/ml) had a tendency to increase as compared to the data obtained in tears of the control group (287.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.01\u00a0ng/ml) as well as the cystatin C level of intraocular fluid of these patients vs the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.1). Cystatin SN concentration in serum of patients with melanoma chorioidea (1.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\u00a0ng/ml) was lower vs the control group (3.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32\u00a0ng/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0038), as well as Cystatin SN level in intraocular fluid (1.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0ng/ml) vs the control (2.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.60\u00a0ng/ml, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). There was no difference in cystatin SN concentration in tears of patients and control group.In serum of control (healthy) group, cystatin C concentration is significantly higher than cystatin SN level in serum, tears and intraocular fluid. The reverse correlation was revealed between the level of these inhibitors in serum, that is suggested their possible interaction. In melanoma patients the reciprocal changes in cystatin C and cystatin SN were shown: increased cystatin C and decreased cystatin SN level in all biological fluids studied. On the basis of cystatins distribution in biological fluids of patients one can suggest their involvement in pathological process as system reaction of organism on tumor development.",

The control group consisted of 32 patients with morphological verified diagnosis of stage I\u2013II gastric cancer. Examination with the purpose to determine hypermethylation of DNA was performed simultaneously in biopsy materials and blood plasma.

Blood serum samples and biopsy specimens were collected at diagnosis until the therapy is started. All patients with chronic atrophic gastritis infected with H. pylori underwent anti-H. pylori therapy according to the protocol. Chronic atrophic gastritis was found at morphologic examination in 40 (50%) patients according to \u201cCorrea\u201d cascade. 36 (45%) patients had intestinal metaplasia, and 4 (5%) patients had dysplasia. Reaction was considered to be positive in cases, when the level of methylation in genes listed above was higher in blood serum than in biopsy materials.High concentrations of methylated APE, T1MP3 and hMLIH in genes were found in blood serum of 8 (10%) patients. In the control group, all 32 patients with gastric cancer had high methylation level in blood serum. In the remaining 72 (90%) patients, no high concentration of DNA methylation was found. After the 2-nd course of anti-H. pylori therapy, patients underwent morphologic and endoscopic examinations according to the protocol. Eradication of H. pylori was determined in 86% patients who received therapy. Intestinal metaplasia decreased from 45% to 25% (20 patients). Mild dysplasia was found in 1.2% of cases. Repeated analysis of methylation level showed its decrease after anti-H. pylori therapy in 4 (50%) out of 8 patients.Genetic tests show that DNA methylation in patients with chronic atrophic gastritis has high diagnostic importance. Anti-H. pylori therapy at the different stages of \u201cCorrea\u201d cascade has high level of induction in transforming into non invase gastric cancer.",

The Chelyabinsk region is among the areas of increased cancer risk. The incidence of head and neck cancer is steadily increasing, accounting for 20\u201325% of all cancer cases in Russia. Oropharyngeal cancer makes up 5.1% of all cancers.The object of the study was the population of the Chelyabinsk region. The analysis was conducted according to the materials of the annual reports of the statistics department of the Chelyabinsk district oncology dispensary.Out of the total cancer cases for the population of Chelyabinsk region in 2014, oro-pharyngeal cancer comprised 2.06%, including cancers of the lip (0.35%), tongue (0.47%), major salivary glands (0.22%), other unspecified parts of the mouth (0.52%), oropharynx (0.33%), nasopharynx (0.1%) and hypopharynx (0.07%). From 2008 to 2014, the incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancer among adult population of Chelyabinsk city and Chelyabinsk region showed an 8.8% increase. In the period from 2011 to 2014, the incidence of oral and pharyngeal cancer tended to increase, the overall rise being 71.8%. It should be noted that the oral and pharyngeal cancer incidence was 3 times higher in males than in females in 2013 and 2 times higher in 2014. One of the main indicators that determine the prognosis for the development of cancer, is the extent of tumor at time of diagnosis.Out of the total cancer cases for the population of Chelyabinsk region in 2014, cancer of the oral cavity comprised 1.33%, pharyngeal cancer 0.6%, lip cancer 0.13%, ranking the 17th, 19th and 24th place respectively among the causes of death from all cancers. Analyzing the dynamics of mortality from cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx during the study period, it was revealed that the mortality rate increased by 0.7%.Head and neck tumors are a rare group of clinically and biologically diverse neoplastic diseases. Among the residents of the Chelyabinsk region, men are 2\u20133 times more susceptible to cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx than women. High mortality rate is due to late referral of patients to specialized clinics; most head and neck cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages.",

     "abstract": "Acute myelomonocytic leukemia (FAB M4) is one of the most common forms of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This AML form is characterized by rapid accumulation transformed myeloblasts and monoblasts in bone marrow, with the rapid suppression of normal hematopoiesis. Bone marrow microenvironment is one of the main factors determining drug resistance of leukemic cells. It is known that the adhesion of leukemic cells to mesenchymal stem cell and bone marrow extracellular matrix (laminin, collagen) enhances their drug resistance. However, it remains unknown whether the emergence of drug resistance when cell\u2013cell contacts are formed only between leukemia cells, without the involvement of bone marrow stromal elements. We studied the role of cell aggregation in drug resistance of leukemic cells. We used the bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) isolated from the patients with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. For the formation of multicellular aggregates, BMMC were cultivated in 96-well plates coated with 1.5% agarose. We showed that resistance of BMMC to bortezomib, doxorubicin and fludarabine in multicellular aggregates was increased. In three-dimensional multicellular aggregates of BMMC index IC50 for bortezomib, doxorubicin and fludarabine was 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0ng/ml, 1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4\u00a0mkM and 0.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0mkM, respectively. In control condition, index IC50 bortezomib, doxorubicin and fludarabine was significantly lower, 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5\u00a0ng/ml, 0.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0mkM and 0.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.001\u00a0mkM, respectively. In multicellular aggregates of BMMC number of mitotic cells and expression of Ki-67 protein were not significantly different from the control. It has also been shown that cells in multicellular aggregates increased expression antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Suppression of BMMC aggregation by culturing the cells in medium containing 0.9% methylcellulose resulted in decreased IC50 index for bortezomib, doxorubicin and fludarabine, 2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0ng/ml, 0.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004\u00a0mkM and 0.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005\u00a0mkM, respectively. Expression of the Bcl-2 protein was also decreased.

     "abstract": "Blood-derived biomarkers, such as circulating tumour cells (CTCs) and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), are a valuable source of molecular genetic data for tumours they spring from. In translational cancer research, the \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d concept has been put forward to denote the detection and molecular characterization of these biomarkers.The idea of liquid biopsy is based on a hypothesis that profiles of somatic mutations in CTCs and ctDNA are identical to those in the original tumour. Therefore, the mutation status of the source tumour can be revealed through the molecular analysis of the CTCs and ctDNA obtained from the blood. The major advantages of liquid biopsy are an essentially decreased invasiveness (no need for tissue biopsy, surgery or bronchoscopy) and an ability to carry out the analysis at patient\u2019s follow up (e.g. to monitor for residual disease).However, both the CTCs and ctDNA are not abundant in the bloodstream and their capture is technically challenging. Also, due to tumour heterogeneity, the CTCs may not fully represent the entire tumour, while ctDNA is naturally fragmented and degraded, so its utility for genetic analysis may be limited. Finally, the DNA extracted from CTCs and, especially, ctDNA are \u201ccontaminated\u201d by DNA from non-tumour cells from the bloodstream raising a challenge of detecting mutant DNA among significantly prevailing wild-type DNA.Some of these issues can be overcome by using such advanced techniques as BEAMing, digital PCR or ultra-deep sequencing, but their use in standard clinical settings is limited by the need for special equipment and associated costs. Inexpensive and less sophisticated, but still highly sensitive and specific, approaches, such as COLD-PCR or wild-type blocking PCR, are also available to detect \u201cdruggable\u201d mutations in CTCs and ctDNA.Application of these approaches of liquid biopsy in clinical practice may be highly beneficial for personalized care of lung cancer patients.",

Preform of cathepsin B and cystatins B and C also are universally involved into development of different tumors. Tumor cells as well as tumor-associated macrophages have been shown to secrete active forms of proteases and their inhibitors; however, their roles, especially those of proenzymes as markers of malignancy, are still under investigation.to evaluate procathepsin B and endogenous inhibitors of cysteine proteases cystatins B and C in tumors of reproductive system.Serum and ascites fluid of 38 patients with ovarian cancer (among them 15 patients after treatment) and benign ovarian tumors (n\u00a0=\u00a09), endometrial cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a031, before treatment 14), mammalian cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a029, before treatment 18) of stages II\u2013IV for all groups, from Department of Gynecology of Regional Oncology Center, Novosibirsk, were under investigation. Serum of practically healthy women aged 18\u201380 (n\u00a0=\u00a082) from Regional Diagnostic Center, Novosibirsk, was used as a control group. Serum of women with tumors of the reproductive system and ascites fluids of women with ovarian tumors (aged 18\u201380 years), before operation were used for assay of procathepsin B, cysteine protease inhibitors cystatins B and C. Serum procathepsin B concentration was measured by ELISA commercial kit for human (R&D) USA; cystatin C using BioVendor commercial kits (Czechia), cystatin B \u2013 with help of ELISA kits for human (USCN Life Science Inc., Wuhan, China). Common biomarker of ovarian cancer, CA-125, was assayed by using a commercial kit (Vector, Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Region, Russia). Statistical analysis performed by one a way ANOVA Statistic 12, program with help of Kruskall\u2013Wallis test and the Mann\u2013Whitney U test used to assess differences in procathepsin B or cystatins B and C levels between patient groups. Statistical analysis was performed with the soft package Statistics 12, with the level of significance being set at <0.05.In serum of patients with endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, mammalian cancer \u2013 significant increases in serum procathepsin B (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), cystatin B (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and CA-125 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were noted. However, in patients with benign tumor increased serum common tumor marker CA-125 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005 vs. healthy controls) was shown without any changes in serum level of procathepsin B, cystatins B and C. Concentrations procathepsin B and Cystatin B in serum and ascites of patients with ovarian tumor was used to assess differences in procathepsin B or cystatins B and C levels between groups. Serum procathepsin B(p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and in ascites fluid of patients with ovarian cancer (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) was shown to significant increase in ovarian cancer group vs. benign ovarian tumors group. The concentration of CA-125 in ascites of patients with ovarian cancer (p\u00a0<\u00a00.000) and benign ovarian tumors (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was high, but has not differences between them (p\u00a0>\u00a00.1).One can conclude that serum procathepsin B and endogenous inhibitors of cysteine proteases cystatin B are prospective tumor biomarkers in reproductive system tumors. Procathepsin B and cystatin B seem to be important in differential diagnosis of ovarian cancer and benign ovarian tumors. Procathepsin B and cystatin B are involved in breast and endometrial cancer that warrants further investigation of their role in cancer.",

     "abstract": "Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are the cell population that differs in morphofunctional characteristics from peripheral blood cells (Gregory and Houghton, 2011). The first study to identify the presence of TANs as an independent poor prognostic factor and to include TANs into a prognostic risk model was published in 2006 (Donskov , 2006). Specific signals during cancer progression have been shown to induce the emergence of a pro-tumor phenotype of neutrophils (PMN). Frinlender (2013) points out an anti-tumor phenotype of TANs. Of particular interest is the study of interaction of neutrophils with T cells because the latter are considered to be cytotoxic cells mediating antitumor immunity. The aim of the study was to assess the lymphoid cell infiltration (LCI) and the functional status of TANs in ovarian cancer. LCI was assessed by immunohistochemistry and the levels of mieloproxydase (MPO) and cationic proteins (CP) were evaluated by cytochemical methods in ovarian carcinoma surgical resection specimens. The results were presented as a mean cytochemical coefficient (MCC). The intensity of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) test was expressed as a percentage. Obtained results were analyzed by nonparametric statistical methods. The Kruskal\u2013Wallis test was used to evaluate the differences between groups.We established that low intensity of infiltration in general and formation of marginal lymphoid cell ridge in some tumors are typical for malignant ovarian neoplasms. More intensive infiltration was found in the regions of the rapid growth of tumor cells, i.e. invasion zone. In some cases, a group of tumor cells was separated from the main part of the parenchyma and surrounded by lymphoid elements. Conditions are created under which active spread of cancer cells in the parenchyma is associated with intensive lymphoid cells infiltration in the stroma. Total count and density of lymphoid cells can significantly vary: from single lymphoid elements uniformly scattered in the tumor tissue to focal accumulations. In tumor tissue location of lymphoid cells is irregular, so most of the infiltration is in the stroma and among the cancer cells only solitary lymphocytes are found. Lymphoid cells which make up the infiltration include 12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.52% of macrophages, 22.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3% of plasma cells, 62.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1% of lymphocytes and 3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9% of PMN. Total amount of cells was 224.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a032.8 per 1\u00a0mm2 of tumor.Lymphocytes in ovarian carcinomas do not form large clusters; they are disposed among other lymphoid cells in the stroma on the periphery of the tumor. Plasma cells have a classical morphological structure and often locate in the stroma and on the periphery of the tumor. Macrophages are an integral part of the tumor infiltrate. In the tumor they become stretched and angular. Macrophages usually have large dimensions, and they are located in the stroma as well as in the parenchyma among the cancer cells. Segmented leukocytes (presented in the vast majority by neutrophils) are constantly found in the infiltrate of the stroma and the parenchyma, most often they are found near or among massive necrosis.Analysis of TANs functional activity in comparison with the peripheral blood neutrophils has shown that MPO activity elevated and amounted 2.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43 MCC against 1.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 MCC in the peripheral blood neutrophils, the level of CP also increased and amounted 1.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39 MCC against 0.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.43 MCC. TANs activity in NBT-test was not significantly different from that of the peripheral blood neutrophils.TANs compose the minor part of primary ovarian tumor infiltrate. Indicators of aerobic and anaerobic bactericidal activity of TANs significantly exceed that of the peripheral blood neutrophils in patients with ovarian cancer.This work was conducted in the framework of implementing the state assignment of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation No. 1163 \u2013 Russia.",

     "abstract": "Lung cancers are characterized by the genetic alterations that often affect a common group of oncogenic signaling pathways. Identification of biologically significant genetic alterations in lung cancer that lead to activation of oncogenes and inactivation of tumor suppressor genes has the potential to provide further therapeutic opportunities (Cooper, 2013). In this context, it is important that molecular aberrations may act as negative predictors of sensitivity to treatment. The discovery of driver oncogenes, such as activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR), has made personalized medicine for lung cancer a reality. Despite the high initial results, NSCLC patients acquire resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the worldwide. There are several findings suggesting that the effect of tyrosine kinase inhibitors could be limited to patients harboring KRAS mutation. To date, a limited information regarding link of morphological portrait of adenocarcinomas with bearing of simultaneously concurrent mutations of KRAS and EGFR genes. The detection of concurrent gene mutation is usually carried out in a mixture of tumor cells. We plan to analyze EGFR and KRAS mutations in all clonal components (or morphological structures) of NSCLC tumors isolated by laser microdissection. So, we suggest that NSCLC clonal components might bear two concurrent EGFR and KRAS mutations simultaneously or different clonal components might bear either EGFR or KRAS mutations. The data obtained can predict resistance to EGFR-TKIs and affect therapeutic decision making.The tumor samples were obtained from archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Paraffin was removed by xylene extraction, and the sample was subsequently lysed by proteinase K. The region containing the highest percentage of tumor cells (at least 50%) was dissected. Microscopes Axio Scope A1 and Axio Star plus (Carl Zeiss, Germany) was used to perform histological analysis. If necessary, tumour cells were carefully selected and removed from the samples by laser microdissection using a P.A.L.M. microlaser instrument (PALM AdhesiveCaps, P.A.L.M., Bernried, Germany). EGFR (exon 19 deletion and 21 L858R) and KRAS (Gly12Cys, Gly12Ser, Gly12Arg, Gly12Val, Gly12Asp, Gly12Ala, Gly13Asp) gene amplification was based on RT-PCR on CFX96 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad).A total of 115 patients with stage (IIIB\u2013IV) of NSCLC with EGFR-TKI- sensitive mutations were eligible for the analysis. A rare coexistence of KRAS and EGFR mutations were observed in 3 patients (2.6%). The first sample was described as nonmucinous solid adenocarcinoma and has deletion of 19 exon of EGFR gene and G12C mutation of KRAS gene. The second sample was described as mucinous lepidic adenocarcinoma and has deletion of 19 exon of EGFR gene and G12D mutation of KRAS gene. The third sample was described as mucinous adenocarcinoma with solid and acinar monoclonal components and also has deletion of 19 exon of EGFR gene and G12C mutation of KRAS gene. Of all the samples, only one had two different monoclonal components. Unfortunately, this sample was not available due to biopsy and few numbers of cells for microdissection. Fiala et al. (2013) reported that KRAS mutations were not only as a negative prognostic factor and also as a biomarker predicting resistance to EGFR-TKIs, especially G12C. Patient with nonmucinous solid adenocarcinoma with deletion of 19 exon and G12C (EGFR and KRAS genes, respectively) is unlikely to benefit from receiving gefitinib or erlotinib.The data obtained show that further studies are required to improve personalized therapy for NSCLC patients. The frequency and type of KRAS and EGFR mutations were first assessed in NSCLC patients from West Siberia.This work was supported by a Grant from theOPTEK Company(No122/2014/51/Nvs).",

Evaluation of the PMEPA 1 gene expression was carried out using RT-PCR. For evaluation of TMEPAI protein expression, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were developed by using hybridoma techniques. Specificity of prepared monoclonal antibodies against recombinant TMEPAI and evaluation of its expression in the clinical samples using selected mAbs were performed using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry.We have identified more than two-fold increase in gene expression of PMEPA1 in tumor tissue in 44% of patients. The monoclonal antibodies have shown the capacity to specifically recognize the recombinant TMEPAI in HEK293T cell lysates. We also evaluate the ability of the selected antibodies to recognize the target protein in fixed cells by immunocytochemistry. The evaluation of TMEPAI in adenocarcinoma samples collected from gastric cancer patients revealed decreased protein expression. We have observed pronounced expression of TMEPAI in normal gastric epithelial cells, while tumor cells from gastric adenomas and adenocarcinomas samples were mostly negative for target protein expression. We found that gastric epithelium cells lose the TMEPAI expression concurrent with severe dysplasia.Apparently, the TMEPAI may be a potential biomarker of malignant transformation risk of the stomach epithelium.The presented study was financially supported by Grants from the Russian Fund for Basic Research (14-04-31500) and Tomsk State University Competitiveness Improvement Program.",

     "abstract": "The Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) represents an etiological agent for a number of human benign and malignant tumors. One of the EBV encoded proteins, the latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1), is involved in activation of many signaling pathways and transcription factors leading EBV infected cells to immortalization and transformation.It\u2019s well known that almost all worlds\u2019 population is infected with EBV. As usually, infection occurs during early childhood without serious consequences for infected people. At the same time a secondary infection by additional EBV strain(s) occurs quite often. During the in vitro cultivation of peripheral blood lymphocyte from persons infected with multiple strains of the virus, only one of them having LMP1 oncogene with highest transforming potential becomes dominant while the others are eliminated.To figure out whether pattern of LMP1 expressions reflects the origin of EBV strains, six cell lines from patients with tumors, associated and not-associated with the virus and healthy individuals were established. The nucleotide and deductive amino acid (a.a.) sequences of LMP1 isolates tested were analyzed and compared with those of LMP1 isolates obtained from eight cell lines of African and Japanese EBV-associated Burkitt\u2019s lymphomas (BL) origin.As the result, in four out of six cell lines of Russian origin (2 from patients with lymphoid pathology and 2 from PBLs of blood donors) the low divergent LMP1 B95.8/A variant characterized by a low transforming activity and a small number of a.a. substitutions was detected. For other two cell lines originated from EBV-associated patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and not virus-associated Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma patient the LMP1Med- and LMP1China1 variants, characterized by a larger set of mutations and high transforming potential, were found. Low divergent LMP1 variants (B95.8 or B95.8/A) were observed for 13 of 15 LMP1 samples from PBLs of Russian blood donors; in 2 donors highly divergent China1 and NC LMP1 variants were also detected. Among eight cell lines of BL origin three lines were the sources of the prototype EBV strain B95.8 (Jijoye, P3HR1, Raji). From other five cell lines (Daudi, Namalva, Ag 876, NC37 and Akata) LMP1 variants Med- and China1, characterized by a significant number of mutations and high transforming capacity were obtained.Genetic relationship between LMP1 isolates from cell lines of Russian and BL origin were analyzed by the phylogenetic tree. It follows from the constructed tree that cell lines of Russian and BL lymphoma origin formed two separate clusters located at the tree a distance from each other, indicating genetic proximity for respective groups of cell lines. The data obtained complemented with the results of our previous studies suggest that among Russians represented by cancer patients and healthy individuals, EBV strains with predominantly low transforming capacity of LMP1 are persisting. These findings are likely can explain the non-endemic nature of the EBV-associated pathologies in Russia.On the other hand, one can speculate that in African countries which are endemic for BL highly oncogenic strains of EBV are dominated, the indirect confirmation of what is the detection in cell lines of BL origin LMP1 isolates having high transforming activity. The results of this study let us also to suggest that LMP1 expression pattern in non-endemic region like Russia does not reflect the type of malignancy but rather reflect their geographic origin.",

     "abstract": "The Hsp70 chaperone is one of the major components of tumor microenvironment displaying multiple not yet established functions. It was shown to stimulate innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity in a variety of cancer models. These effects were due to active release of endogenous Hsp70 to an extracellular matrix and therefore the extracellular chaperone can be a trigger of multiple events in the whole tumor. Factors inducing Hsp70 release are heat stress, inhibitors of important signaling proteins, anticancer drugs and X-ray treatment. Recently we have shown that delivery of Hsp70 can be efficient pusher of its intracellular analogue to extracellular milieu. In this study we show that intracellular cycling of exo- and endogenous Hsp70s increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to cytotoxic lymphocytes. Moreover, the results of in vivo studies employing B16 mouse melanoma and C6 rat glioblastoma as targets proved the therapeutic relevance of exogenous Hsp70 in intra-tumoral application.To uncover the mechanisms of the anticancer effect we used inhibitors and markers of intra- and extracellular protein transport. The data of these studies showed multiplicity of pathways using which exo-Hsp70 reaches cytosol and more usable ones was endocytosis. To be exported intracellular Hsp70 employs vesicular structures as well as intra-membrane lipid structures.Analyzing Hsp70 molecule we found the domain with potential vector activity, i.g. cell penetrating function. This peptide was synthesized and shown to cross a cellular membrane with efficacy exceeding that the whole Hsp70 molecule. Furthermore, the new peptide was used as a carrier for the delivery inside living cells antibody to Hsp70. The resulting construct was found to reduce the resistance of tumor cells to pro-apoptotic effect of staurosporin.Taking together these data, we can suggest that Hsp70 and its fragments can be effective players in communication between cells assembling functionally active tumor.The work was supported by Grant ofRussian Scientific Foundation(N14-50-00068).",

     "abstract": "Aberrant alterations of DNA methylation patterns have been recognized as early and common events in oncogenesis emphasizing high therapeutic and preventive potential. Concurrent epigenetic silencing of multiple tumour suppressor genes has been reported in different tumours suggesting the existence of a directed program, whereby groups of genes are regulated by promoter methylation. The molecular bases of such a program remain largely unclear. Certain long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been recently identified that are responsible for target specificity of the histone modification complexes. It remains incompletely understood, however, if lncRNAs may play a role in patterning DNA methylation. In this study, we asked by using gastrointestinal stromal tumours as a model if an epigenetic related HOX Antisense Intergenic RNA, or HOTAIR, is involved in establishment of DNA methylation patterns. To this end, we first showed high up-regulation of HOTAIR in patient samples of high risk compared to low and intermediate risk groups (n\u00a0=\u00a066, p\u00a0=\u00a06.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126), what is supported by the earlier reports on common carcinomas. Highest levels of HOTAIR endogenous expression were next detected also in cell lines GIST T1, GIST48b and GIST882. Stable knockdown of HOTAIR was achieved in GIST T1 and GIST48b cells by RNAi using lentiviral transduction. As expected epigenetic alterations due to HOTAIR knockdown could develop with a delay, genome-wide DNA methylation profiling was performed at passage 12 after the transduction on the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip platform in triplicates. DNA methylation data were analysed by an R package RnBeads. A total of 218 CpG sites got hypomethylated upon HOTAIR knockdown in GIST T1 and GIST48b cells (\u0394\u03b2\u00a0>\u00a00.3, FDR\u00a0<\u00a00.05). These included potential tumour suppressors, transcription factors, tumour-specific antigens, genes related to angiogenesis or involved in metabolism. As confirmed by using bisulfite pyrosequencing for a representative locus, DNA methylation of 64% degree at promoter associated CpG sites of the potential tumour suppressor RASSF1 was almost entirely erased upon HOTAIR knockdown in GIST T1 cell line with concomitant up-regulation detected by qRT-PCR. Concordant with earlier reports, HOTAIR knockdown led to reduced migration potential in GIST T1 cells. Taken together, the results suggest that HOTAIR is one of the factors involved in establishment of specific DNA methylation patterns in GIST. While the molecular mechanism remains to be determined, it is plausible to assume a recruitment of DNA methyltransferases by the Polycomb repressive complex 2, which target specificity is determined by HOTAIR. The results further suggest the feasibility of manipulating DNA methylation patterns in a targeted manner and are of potential interest in context of developing epigenetic cancer therapy.The study is supported by theInterdisciplinary Centre for Clinical Research(IZKF) at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg.",

     "abstract": "The most important development in head and neck oncology of the past decade is the demonstration that patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-mediated oropharyngeal cancers have significantly improved outcomes, compared to HPV-negative counterpart patients.We examined racial disparities among 102 oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) patients (30 African Americans, 72 Whites) comparing the present of HPV16/18 E6 and E7 oncoproteins, and p16Ink4A overexpression, with times to disease progression (DP) and disease specific survival (DSS). Expression of HPV16/18 transcripts was assessed by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction using type-specific E6/E7 primers; p16Ink4A was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. African Americans were significantly more likely to present with high T stage disease and receive nonsurgical treatment. HPV16/18 was present in 63% of patients; no racial differences were observed. Silenced p16Ink4A in OPC was significantly more common in African Americans (15/24) than Whites (20/69) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and HPV16\u00a0+\u00a0African Americans (6/24) than HPV\u00a0+\u00a0Whites (2/42) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023). Kaplan Meier analysis for DSS revealed a protective effect for p16Ink4A overexpression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0028), HPV16+ (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036), and Whites (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0039). Shorter DSS was associated with primary definitive chemoradiation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) and T3/T4 disease (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). A protective effect with respect to disease progression was observed for HPV16+ (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), Whites (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0006) and p16Ink4A overexpression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). African Americans with OPC experience poorer outcomes likely due to p16Ink4A silencing, higher T stage, and nonsurgical treatment, but not lower rates of transcriptionally active HPV16/18.We studied patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma for HPV16 and HPV18, local immune response, p16 expression and outcome.Overexpression of p16INK4a was uncommon in oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (17/112 or 15.2%). HPV16 and HPV18 were detected in 22.6% and 11% patients respectively. We demonstrated that the presence of transcriptionally active HPV16 in oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas does not correlate with p16INK4a overexpression, enhanced local tumor immunity, or improved outcome. To investigate the possible mechanism of protective effect of HPV and p16INK4a, we have developed primary cancer cell lines from resections with known patterns of invasion. Given that cell lines derived from HPV-mediated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas are less invasive than their HPV-negative counterparts, we tested the hypothesis that viral oncoproteins E6, E7, and p16INK4a can affect tumor invasion. We demonstrated that p16INK4a overexpression in two cancer cell lines (UAB-3 and UAB-4), derived from oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas with the most aggressive invasive phenotype, dramatically decrease tumor invasiveness by altering expression of extracellular matrix remodeling genes. Pathway analysis integrating changes in RNA expression and kinase activities reveals different potential p16INK4a-sensitive pathways. In summary, we presented clinical data from a large cohort of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients with respect to transcriptionally active HPV16, p16INK4a overexpression, local adaptive tumor immunity, and outcome. Observed differences in clinical outcomes could be perhaps due to differential immune responses and gene activation profile. The detection of a HPV-positivity in HNSCC has important clinical implications as independent prognostic factor for treatment deintensification and improved survival of HPV-mediated oropharyngeal cancers. In our knowledge the further studies are needed to dissect the HPV-positive HNSCC in more detail to find the effective prognostic markers as well as molecular targets to affect tumor behavior.",

     "abstract": "Alveolar macrophages (AM) are pulmonary residents of the bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocyte system that play a critical role in several diverse lung functions and in lung host defense. The role of AM in lung cancer is multifaceted. AM secretion of proinflammatory cytokines has been found to enhance antitumor functions, cytostasis and cytotoxicity. AM have also demonstrated to have protumor functions resulting in tumor progression.24-week-old male A/f mice were kept in plastic cages under standard laboratory conditions and received food and water ad libitum. Animals were randomly assigned to the following experimental groups: I \u2013 control, II \u2013 radiation only, III \u2013 sulphur dioxide only, IV \u2013 sulphur dioxide\u00a0+\u00a0radiation. Animals were subjected to total irradiation at dose 1.0\u00a0Gy (dose density of 16.6\u00a0cGy/min, using a 60Co gamma equipment). After irradiation mice were inhaled air with sulphur dioxide (20\u00a0mg/m3 for 1\u00a0h) in separate exposure chamber.At the 20th week of experiment the 20 mice per each group were subjected to autopsy. Excised lungs were fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin. To obtain an index of tumor incidence, the percentage of tumor \u2013 bearing mice per total number of mice in each group was calculated. Tumor multiplicity was defined as the average number of tumors per mice, obtained by dividing the total number of tumors by the total number of mice per group, including non-tumor bearing animals.Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of lungs was performed on 6 mice (animals were anesthetized by an ip injection of sodium thiopental) from each study group at the 1, 7, 15 and 30\u00a0days after irradiation and SO2 inhalation. Total cells of BAL were counted using hemocytometer chamber and an optical microscope with a 400\u00d7 zoom. BAL differential cell (macrophages, lymphocytes, eosinophiles and neutrophils) counts were performed on slides (Romanowsky stain). Phagocytic activity of AM was counted on slides. AM morphometric study was done by measuring the area of each cell (square of cell) and the area of nuclear of each cell (square of nuclear) with use of the original image analyzer computer system.Results of the combined effects of radiation and inhalation of sulfur dioxide showed the growth of tumor quantity in the lung: the frequency of adenomas/mouse was more than 42% higher than that of control group. Synergism coefficient was 1.1 in this case.Irradiation at a dose of 1.0\u00a0Gy modifies the reaction of free cells of lung on the action of sulfur dioxide, which is manifested in the change of the number of cells in the BAL fluid, the phagocytic activity of the AM, as well as of the changes the morphometric parameters of their cells.Thus, if the amount of radiation exposure of BAL cells was significantly reduced by the 1st and 7th days, and after inhalation of sulfur dioxide \u2013 tended to increase, then the combined action on the 7th day it was almost half the theoretical (hypothetical) the sum of the separate effects of the studied factors. Exposure to sulfur dioxide significantly slowed the activation of cell count. It was found, that after combined action of the investigated factors the morphological characteristics of macrophages (reducing the square of cells and their nuclei) have changed (7th and 15th day). The absorption activity of phagocytes was significantly reduced (7\u00a0day).",

     "abstract": "Despite the abundance of theoretical evidences displaying the considerable role of the \u201csoil\u201d in metastasis progression, the majority of cancer research and cancer therapy pathogenetic methods focused mainly on the tumor cells. There is still no clear clinical data showing the role of \u201csoil\u201d in the metastasis. Identification of factors and mechanisms driving the conditions promoting tumor dissemination may lead to therapeutic strategy to detect and prevent metastases at the earliest step. It has been established that bone marrow-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells home to pre-metastatic sites before tumor cells infiltrate in these sites. These hematopoietic progenitor cells form regulatory cell cluster of stromal microenvironment (premetastatic niche) to promote secondary tumor growth. In this context, the aim of our study was to evaluate the level of different pools of circulating tumor cells and bone marrow progenitor cells in the blood of patients with breast cancer in the dynamics of neoadjuvant chemotherapy.Patients (prospective study) with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer in the age range 18\u201350 years and tumor volume of 2.0(> or =)\u00a0cm, referred at the Tomsk Cancer Research Institute for treatment were included into the study. Eligibility criteria were as follows: the patient\u2019s informed consent to participate in research; morphologically verified diagnosis of invasive carcinoma of non-specific type; luminal B-1, -2, triple negative (basal-like subtype included), HER2 positive breast cancer; T2-4N0-3M0; preserved menstrual function; satisfactory performance status (on a scale (< or =) ECOG 2). Exclusion Criteria were: other than luminal histological type of breast cancer, multiple primary cancer; chronic inflammatory diseases in the acute stage. Samples of venous blood taken from breast cancer patients before biopsy, after biopsy and after each subsequent course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACHT) were served as a study material. The various pools of circulating tumor cells and bone-marrow derived progenitor cells were determined using monoclonal antibodies to EpCam, CD44, CD45, CD24, N-cadherin, CD34, CD133, CD202, VEGFR1 and CD90, labeled with different fluorochromes on flow cytometry BD FACSCanto \u2122 II.The study showed that each succeeding course of NACHT increased blood levels of circulating tumor cells, and bone marrow progenitor cells with a phenotype characteristic of EPC (endothelial progenitor cells) (CD34\u00a0+\u00a0CD45\u2013VEGFR\u00a0+\u00a0CD133\u00a0+\u00a0CD202\u00a0+) and MSC (mesenchymal progenitor stem cells fibroblasts) (CD34\u2013CD90\u00a0+\u00a0VEGFR1\u2013CD45\u2013CD202\u2013).

     "abstract": "The environmental pollutant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the most toxic among the dioxin xenobiotics and induces a broad spectrum of biological responses, including immunotoxicity and cancer [1]. Macrophages are very plastic cells and can acquire various functionally distinct phenotypes depending on the physiological context. They are key regulators of the innate immune response and determine the developmental thrust of the adaptive immune response. The action of TCDD on macrophages is unique in that carried out through a variety of pathways, inducing activation of a number of cytokines [2]. Our previous analysis showed that the list of such cytokines was not complete [3]. IL-12 family of cytokines is the key players in the regulation of T cell responses. Little is known of the effects that TCDD has on the expression of IL-12 family member\u2019s genes, such as IL12A, IL12B, IL27 and EBI3, which forms a critically important cytokines IL-12 and IL-27, secreted by human macrophages. In the present work, the effects of TCDD on expression of IL-12 family member\u2019s genes in human macrophages have been investigated.To examine the effects of TCDD on the functional characteristics of macrophages, experiments have been conducted on the monocyte-like cell line U937 and primary human macrophages. Obtained data demonstrate functional activity of DREs in IL12A, IL12B and IL4 gene promoters via AhR signal pathway. The mRNA expression dynamics of IL12A, IL12B, IL4, IL27 and EBI3 cytokines genes also evidence the indirect TCDD\u2013mediated modulation of these genes via intrinsic TFs, one of which is ATF3.Exposure to TCDD induces a mechanism of two-stage regulation of the expression of some IL-12 family subunits through primary activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor by the TCDD-containing complex followed by ATF3-dependent suppression of their expression. This may result in an abrupt reduction of the anti-tumor response mediated by O and NK cells. The observed increase in ATF3 and decrease in IL-12 following exposure to TCDD are consistent with data on the expression of these genes in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Reliance upon available data that demonstrate a decrease in IL-12 alongside an increase in the expression of other cytokines typical of TAMs confirms the hypothesis that TCDD can shift the phenotype of a macrophage towards a tumor-associated direction. This mechanism may be one of the others underlying TCDD-driven tumor promotion.This work was supported by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research(Russia) (No. 12-04-01736) and state projects VI.60.1.1 and VI.61.1.2.",

     "abstract": "Existing methods for the preoperative detection of metastases in thyroid cancer have low efficiency and highly invasive. Therefore, the searches for laboratory markers that will indicate the presence of metastases including hidden with high reliability in cancer of the thyroid gland are relevant.Immune system is one of the key mechanisms for regulation of tissue proliferation. Autoreactive lymphocytes restrict the growth and proliferation of tissues. In turn autoreactive lymphocytes are controlled by idiotypic lymphocytes. Abnormalities in the regulation system can be the cause of tumor growth, such as excess activity of anti-idiotypic lymphocytes. Previously we conducted a comparative analysis of the level of autoantibodies to various antigens (thyroglobulin, thyroid stimulating hormone receptor, native DNA, anionic proteins vascular endothelium), as well as anti-idiotypic antibodies to thyroglobulin in thyroid cancer patients with metastases and without metastases. Significant differences between investigated groups were found in the level of anti-idiotypic antibodies against antibodies to thyroglobulin. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the feasibility of using anti-idiotypic antibodies against antibodies to thyroglobulin as a marker of metastatic thyroid cancer.All studied patients with thyroid cancer were hospitalized at Primushko Regional Clinical Oncology Center of the Ministry of Health of the Udmurt Republic, Izhevsk. Blood was taken from patients before surgery. The level of anti-idiotype antibodies (AIAT) against autoantibodies to thyroglobulin (Tg) and the level of autoantibodies (AUAT) to thyroglobulin were determined in the blood plasma using the test system manufacturing MRC \u201dImmunkulus\u201d. To determine the AIAT against AUAT to Tg, we used the principle of competitive inhibition of the binding reaction with antibodies to thyroglobulin in the presence of analyzed serum. As a source of antibodies to thyroglobulin, we used serum from patients with autoimmune thyroiditis in effective dilutions for competition. Analyzed samples were previously depleted by antibodies to thyroglobulin. The level of the test antibodies was expressed in conventional unit (CU) - optical density of the reaction of antibody binding to the antigen.We found that AIAT against AUAT to Tg were not defined in 43% of thyroid cancer patients with metastases (group I), 57% revealed a relatively high level of AIAT against AUAT to Tg \u2013 0.343\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.027 CU (Group II). In patients with thyroid cancer without metastases, the level of AIAT against AUAT to Tg (0.185\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.083 CU) was lower than that of cancer patients with metastases. Metastatic cancer cannot be differentiated from cancer without metastases in 23% of studied cases.The level of AUAT to Tg in patients with thyroid cancer in the group I was 0.997\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.084 CU and in the group II was 1.087\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.174 CU. The level of AUAT to TG in cancer patients without metastasis was 0.794\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.038 CU. It was found that when the level of AIAT against AUAT to Tg does not allow to distinguish metastatic thyroid cancer from cancer without metastases, it is possible to differentiate status data of thyroid cancer by using the level of autoantibodies to Tg.Moreover, the high level of AIAT against AUAT to Tg in patients with cancer without detectable metastases may be a marker of poor prognosis. So in one of the studied patients diagnosed with papillary cancer without metastasis, the level of AIAT against AUAT to Tg was equal to 0.37 CU, thus indicating the presence of metastases. Indeed, metastases were found in this patient 4 months later.Thus, the level of anti-idiotypic antibodies against autoantibodies to thyroglobulin may be used as a marker for metastases in the differential diagnosis of thyroid cancer.",

     "abstract": "DNA minor groove is the main target of small molecules, which noncovalently and to a certain extent site-specifically bind to appropriate nucleotide sequences. Study of these substances can give rise to understanding the mechanistic relationship between sites of interaction and activity of appropriate enzymes with \u201chouskeeping\u201d function including helicases, topoisomerases, methyltransferases, demethylases and DNA/RNA-polymerases.We revealed for the first time that AT-specific minor groove binding ligands (MGBLs), in particular bisbenzimidazoles (Hoechst33258 and its derivatives), widely used in molecular and cell biology for DNA-staining, induce loss of heterozygosity at high frequency while point mutations and chromosome deletions at insignificant levels. Moreover, we demonstrated that the agents realized their genotoxic blastomogenic effects via homologous recombination mechanism exclusively. Lately the same mechanism of genotoxicity has been shown for MGBL carbazole derivative Curaxin, which is toxic for a broad range of tumor cell lines in vitro and inhibit tumor growth in different mouse models of cancer in vivo. Moreover, powerful antitumor activity has been demonstrated for Trabectedin, which binds to the DNA\u2019s minor groove and alkylate guanine residues. All this provided a framework for wide-ranging investigation of cell response to MGBLs exposure, molecular mechanisms of their recombinogenic as also their anticancer activity. A special interest is paid to epigenetic mechanisms of MGBs action.Our study aimed to examine the epigenetic effects of recombinogenic (Hoechst33342, Hoechst33258) and non-recombinogenic (DAPI, Diminazene, Pentamidine and Netropsin) MGBLs.After we unmasked MGBLs\u2019 recombinogenic activity, we hypothesized that their molecular mechanism of indirect DNA damage involves poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activation. Surprisingly, we found that all AT-specific MGBLs preventing PARP-1 interaction with DNA inhibit its activation, and hence, the DNA-dependent pathway of PARP-1 activation function. These inhibitors effectively block PARP-1 activity in vivo, as it was demonstrated in a Drosophila experimental system and in human breast cancer-derived BT474 cell line.Further epigenetic effects of these indirect genotoxic carcinogens were analyzed using HeLa cell population with epigenetically suppressed GFP-reporter gene as a model. All compounds had strong GFP- reactivation effect. The obtained results confirm scarce data of previous publications on the ability of DNA minor groove ligands to influence gene transcription process. Statistically significant results of changes of DNA methylation level were detected under 5-azaC and Hoechst 33258 treatment, but it was absent after Hoechst 33342 treatment. For the rest compounds significant loss of promoter region methylation was not observed. The common epigenetic marks of transcription include histone H3 trimethylation in lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and histone H3 and H4 acetylation (acH3/acH4) on promoter regions of genes. We showed that TSA, Hoechst 33342 and DAPI treatment of HeLa-TI cells lead to increased level of histone H3 trimethylation of lysines 4 (H3K4me3), but for all that the level of histone H4 acetylation remains without significant changes. On the contrary, histone H3 acetylation level was stably increased at all samples. The modifications are typical for silent genes and decrease of their amount suggests the transcriptional reactivation. Loss of H4K20me3 mark in comparison with untreated control was demonstrated for MGBLs.Taking together, findings of the study will lay the fundamental groundwork for the development of novel anticancer strategies and new chemotherapy effects of small molecules. The mechanism of PARP-1 inhibition by MGBLs and its epigenetic influence on silent genes, via DNA methylation and histone modifications make reasonable further study of these compounds in three prospective directions: (1) as self-acting cytotoxic agents; (2) as a component of combined chemotherapy targeting DNA repair by PARP-1, thereby facilitating DNA damage caused by other anticancer drugs; (3) as an agents reactivating epigenetically repressed genes which silencing occurs during the earliest stages of neoplasia and accumulates with progression toward malignancy.",

Macrophages are known to reveal high plasticity and may change under the influence of microenvironment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes of macrophage functional activity under the influence of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in vitro. This factor is known to be the main angiogenic factor but also possesses several immunomodulatory properties. Here we report that VEGF revealed a dose-dependent effects on cultured freshly isolated murine resident peritoneal macrophages: modulated iNOS mRNA expression, nitroxide and superoxide anion production, decreased 5\u2032-nucleotidase (5\u2032-N) activity, but had no influence on fluid-phase pinocytosis. Moreover, VEGF increased expression of its own mRNA via autocrine pathway as well as of VEGF protein expression. VEGF also induced up-regulation of extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) mRNA, which is considered as a part of macrophage activation phenotype. Production of cytokines and chemokines by macrophages was screened with the help of Multi- analyte ELISArray kits. It was found that incubation of macrophages in the presence of VEGF increased the production of angiogenic cytokines \u2013 TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 as well as several monocyte and leukocyte chemoattractants such as MCP-1, RANTES and MIP-1\u03b2.

     "abstract": "Epigenetics investigates mechanisms that control inheritance of gene expression program during somatic cell divisions. These mechanisms include regulation by DNA methylation, histone post-translational modifications and nucleosome positioning, functioning of regulatory non-coding RNAs, control of alternative splicing of mRNA precursors and high-order chromatin organization. Genome-wide loss of epigenetic stability and increased epigenetic plasticity are common features of all tumor types. In normal tissues epigenetic plasticity allow cells to response on environment signals. Thus, in tumor cells its constitutive activation leads to epigenetic heterogeneity that are the additional hallmark of the most of the classical cancers. Cervical cancers are one of the most interesting models for the analysis of the role of epigenetic changes in tumor progression. These types of tumors are associated with infection of human papilloma viruses of so-called high-risk group (HR-HPV) and characterized by well-defined stages of malignant conversion from intraepithelial neoplasias to carcinomas. The viral DNA can persist in episomal form or integrates into the host-cell genome.Cellular genomes encode genetic information in their linear sequence, but appropriate gene expression requires chromosomes to fold into dynamic complex three-dimensional structures. Scaffold/matrix attachment regions (S/MARs) are specialized genomic DNA sequences that take part in organization of these structures. We demonstrated that methylation of S/MARs was required for their attachment to nuclear matrix and that methylation status of S/MARs was changed in cervical cancer cell compared to normal cells.DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. We found that methylation of the regulatory sequences in the HPV16 genome specifically changes in transformed compared to the normal cervical epithelial cells. Next, we showed that methylation of the transcription factor binding sites modulates the viral oncogene expression. These data suggest that the HPV16 genome methylation may represent an important mechanism that initiates the development of HPV-associated tumors.Using next generation sequencing, we identified pattern of differentially expressed microRNAs in clinical samples of the cervical lesions. We confirmed expression of microRNAs that have been described previously as well as identified new microRNAs that can be potentially involved in the development and progression of cervical cancer. Spectrum of differentially expressed microRNAs includes microRNAs targeting tumor-suppressor genes as well as oncogenes.Telomerase is a key regulator of cell proliferation. This enzyme is silent in normal cells and activated in most of the tumors. Few forms of RNA (hTERT), encoded by telomerase gene were detected in different tumor cells and among them three forms (alfa, beta and gamma) are most well pronounced. We found that in cervical tumors expression of all three forms are significantly increased. In some cases, we also observe higher level of hTERT expression in neighboring \u201cnormal tissue\u201d. The correlation between expression levels of these three forms varied on different stages of the disease (three stages on intraepithelial neoplasias and carcinomas). The function of these three hTERT forms is still not well understood.",

     "abstract": "The most effective method in treatment of inoperable cancer is currently miniallogeneic transplantation. This type of treatment focuses on reaction of \u201cgraft-versus-tumor\u201d. According to preliminary data, such treatment leads to long-term remission in patients with metastatic cancer, who did not respond to previous therapy. Anti-tumor immune response after transplant may be extended or enhanced by additional infusion of donor lymphocytes. Research has shown that introduction of donor lymphocytes achieves complete remission of the tumor, even in case of relapse after allogeneic transplantation from the same donor, but these effects are unstable and not so long because of rapid elimination of donor lymphocytes [1]. The main problem is the preservation of cell transplantation viability and functional activity of the cells in patient\u2019s body, and protecting them from recipient\u2019s immune system. In recent years, most suitable for this purpose are the three-dimensional porous biomaterials (3D-scaffold).Specific pore space does not allow immunity effectors quickly destroy the cells in scaffold [2], [3]. Research Institute of medical materials and implants with shape memory at the Tomsk State University created a porous-permeable incubators (scaffold) of TiNi-based shape memory alloy (TiNi). The material has unique properties: permeable porous structure by open interconnected pores, characterized by high degree of wettability with tissue media and nanoporous inner surface of the pore walls, exhibits high adhesion to various cell types, so all mentioned meet requirements of the bio-chemical and bio-mechanical compatibility. Porous TiNi-based scaffolds allow continually to keep the functionality cells and prolong their action [4], [5].The purpose of this study was to investigate possibility of modulation of antitumor response in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in porous-permeable incubator of TiNi.Intraperitoneal injection of allogeneic bone marrow (BM) reduces metastasis by 30% and has easy 10%-antitumor effect. At the same time, the implantation of bone marrow cells on incubator of TiNi (BM\u00a0+\u00a0TiNi) leads to more pronounced antitumor (25%) and significant antimetastatic effects (45%). Life span of animals with tumors and implanted bone marrow cells on incubator TiNi is increased by 60%Since bone marrow cells do not have direct antiproliferative effect on tumor target cells in vitro, it is assumed that one of the mechanisms effecting the bone marrow transplantation on neoplastic process is the stimulation of endogenous effectors of antitumor immunity.The study of morphological parameters immunocompetent organs showed that administration of allogeneic bone marrow cells can reduce thymic regression, decrease splenomegaly at animals with transplanted tumors.Allogeneic transplantation of bone marrow cells on porous incubator was shown to prolong and enhance antitumor and antimetastatic action compared to injecting the cells. This effect is directly due to the stimulation of antitumor immunity, that is described by the study of immunity factors. The results show perspectives of porous TiNi-based scaffolds in complex treatment of neoplastic diseases.",

     "abstract": "Tumor cells in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) usually have the \u201cclassic\u201d immunophenotype CD19+, CD5+, CD23+, SmIgdim, CD20dim, FMC7-, CD79b-/dim, CD22-/dim. However, sometimes some deviations in antigenic profile CLL cells are observed such as enhanced expression of CD79b, CD22, SmIg and CD20. The most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in CLL are trisomy 12 and deletions of 13q14, 13q34, 6q, 11q, and 17p. It is noted that immunophenotypic deviations in CLL often correlate with some of these cytogenetic anomalies. The investigation of the links between the antigens expression and caryotype of CLL cells leads to differential diagnostics and prognosis in CLL. The goal of the investigation is search for the links between immunophenotypic characteristics of CLL cells and their karyotype.Bone marrow and blood cells from 35 CLL patients are investigated. Immunophenotyping was made using flow cytometer \u201cCytomics F500\u201d (Beckman Coulter) with the use of monoclonal antibodies CD3/CD19/CD45, SmIg \u03ba SmIg \u03bb /CD19, CD5/CD23/CD19, FMC7/CD38/CD19, CD22/CD79b/CD19, CD10/CD20/CD19. For karyotype determination the standard cytogenetic methods and FISH were used.The most frequent deletion in CLL patients was del(13)(q14.3), it was sometimes observed together with (13)(q34) and was found in18 patients (51% of all examined patients). 56% (10/18) of patients in this group had CLL cells phenotype CD19+, CD5+, CD23+, SmIgdim, CD20dim, FMC7-, CD79b-, CD22- and CD38-. Weak (dim) expression of CD79b antigen (in 24\u201392% of cells) was found in 39% (7/18) of patients with del(13)(q14.3), and expression of CD38 (in 22\u201386% of cells) \u2013 in 17% (3/18).The same phenotype was observed in 2 patients (6%) having only del(13)(q34), in one patient (3%) with (13)(q34) trisomy and in 6 patients (17%) with normal karyotype 46, XY.Trisomy 12 was found in 14% (5/35) of explored CLL patients. The immunophenotype of CLL cells in this group was very different with the previous group. All patients (100%) with trisomy 12 had CLL cells with expression of CD79b (94.2% of cells), CD22 (54\u201394.6% of cells), CD38 (31.1\u201399.3% of cells). Additionally 2 of 5 patients (40%) had CLL cells with more bright (dim to mod) CD20 expression and 1 patient (20%) had cells with bright expression of CD79b (in 94.2% of cells). The same phenotype was registered in one patient with del(6q23), comprising CD78b+ (in 97.8% of cells), CD22+ (in 62.6% of cells) and CD38+ (in 32.5% of cells). In 2 patients (6%) with del (11)(q23) expression of CD79b (in 47.3\u201344.8% of cells) and CD38 (in 35.3\u201364.4% of cells).Expression of CD79b, CD22, CD38 is the main feature of cells with recurrent genetic injuries. Immunophenotype without expression of CD79b, CD22, CD38 in most cases differentiates CLL patients with del(13)(q14.3), del (13)(q34), (13q)(34) trisomy and with normal karyotype. Coexpression in the most of the cells of the three antigens CD79b, CD22, CD38 and more bright expression of CD20 proposes trisomy 12 or del(6q). Partial expression of CD79b and CD38 may correlate with del(11)(q23).",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. The incidence of breast cancer in 2014 in the Republic of Mordovia was 69.9 per 100,000 female populations. Breast cancer occurs when excessive expression of oncoproteins switches in the case of transformation of proto-oncogene in PRADI. In primary breast tumors, mutations and the expression of the three oncogenes Her2/neu, C-mys, Int-2, as well as in supressonyh genes \u2013 the p53 gene and the retinoblastoma gene RB are the most common. Several studies found that oncogene \u2013 C-mys was expressed in 16.8% of primary breast cancer cases and in 35% cases with subsequent development of metastases. Proteins that stimulate the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinasescan activateunder the influence of growth factors. Development of breast cancer is regulated by a complex interaction of many hormones and growth factors. Currently, one of the leading theories of developing breast cancer is the increased hormonal stimulation of proliferative processes in the development of neoplasia. One of the manifestations of hormonal imbalance in tumor during a regular decrease in blood competitive inhibitor of the biological effects of estrogen \u2013 progesterone, which is in correlation with the stage of the spread of neoplasia. The role of the overproduction of estrogen in the pathogenesis of breast cancer is confirmed by the fact that in women who underwent oophorectomy before the age of 38\u00a0years, the risk of breast cancer development is 1.5 times less than in those who did not have such operation. Excessive accumulation of lipid peroxidation products in the area of neoplasia activates mechanisms violation of intercellular interaction that caused the destruction of the lipid components of membranes.The study group included 112 patients treated at the State Institution of Health of the Republic of Mordovia \u201cNational Oncology Center\u201d. To identify the nature of tumors, all patients underwent immunohistochemical analysis. Androgen receptors were found in 48% of breast cancer cases, the expression level of androgen receptor in the tumor was much lower than the expression level of estrogen and progesterone receptors. Low levels of progesterone receptor expression in breast cancer cells were combined with high levels of expression of Ki-67 antigen, HER-2 oncoprotein in tumor cells. Patients with HER-2 (3+) and (2+) had more frequent multiple metastases in lymph nodes compared to patients with HER-2 (0) and (1+) phenotypes. Maximum expression of HER-2 oncoprotein in tumor cells indicated high metastatic potential and poor prognosis.It may be concluded that the cellular and molecular mechanisms of breast cancer are complex. Therefore, carcinogenesis has a \u201cmultistep\u201d nature and at least two or more mutations in the cells of the same clone \u2013 parent and child are required to generate malignant tumors. Thus, the development of oncogenic transformation does not necessarily mean the process of tumor formation.",

     "abstract": "Identification of DNA-based biomarkers of cancer cells is highly promising and rapidly developing direction that can advance early detection and therapy of malignancies. DNA adducts are felicitous markers of cancer, because their chemical structure is significantly different from that of mutated or methylated DNA, that allows to determine them with high precision using mass spectrometry. The aim of this work is to develop the methodology of sample preparation and its mass spectrometric analysis. Samples were prepared from the blood plasma and from the tumor tissue from lung cancer patients and from blood of healthy individuals.DNA was isolated from the blood plasma and tissue by using column method (BioSilica, Russia) The final yield from 1\u00a0ml of blood was 100\u00a0ng. DNA samples were subjected to acid hydrolysis (1\u00a0M HCl) at 70\u00a0\u00b0C. After 3\u00a0h, the hydrolysis was stopped by cooling on ice for 5\u00a0min and later on adding an equivalent amount of an alkali and a phosphate buffer solution (pH 7). To assess the extent of hydrolysis of the samples they were analysed by electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel in Tris-acetate buffer. The samples were extracted at cartridge HF Bond Elut-C18 100\u00a0mg, 1\u00a0ml (Agilent Technologies, USA) and eluted in several fractions with a gradual increase of methanol in the eluent. Stream of nitrogen was applied to dry the extract. The samples were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis after pre-separation by UHLC Ultimate 3000 RS (Dionex, USA) in a column Dionex Acclaim RSLC 120 C18 (2.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0mm 120\u00a0A, 0.2\u00a0\u03bcm) flow rate of 0.5\u00a0ml/min using as eluents 0.1% solution of formic acid in water (A) and 0.1% solution of formic acid in atsetontrile (B). Elution was carried out in gradient mode: (%B): 0\u20133min (5%), 3\u201328min (5\u201395%), 28\u201330\u00a0min (95%), 30\u201331\u00a0min (95\u20135%), 31\u201335\u00a0min (5%). Mass spectrometry was carried out on ESI-qTOF ultrahigh resolution Maxis 4G (Bruker, Germany) in the positive ion detection mode range 50\u20131000\u00a0m/z, 2\u00a0Hz with the following settings electrospray ion source: CV 3800\u00a0V, Nebulizer gas 1\u00a0bar, Dry Gas 8 l/min, Dry Temp: 200\u00a0\u00b0C.It was found that the DNA which was cleaved with acid hydrolysis in the result contained single DNA bases. The samples were stable at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for at least 7\u00a0days. The optimal eluent for solid phase extraction of DNA is 80% solution of methanol in water. The number of DNA adducts was evaluated by the integrated value of the mass spectrometric response detector. It was shown that most amount of adducts 4-hydroxy-1-(3-pyridyl)-1- butanone and N3-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl)adenine was found in DNA samples derived from tumor tissue. The adduct N7-(2-carbamoyl-2-hydroxyethyl)guanine was found in tumor tissue samples and DNA derived from plasma, as well as in all samples of healthy tissue.The established protocol of DNA sample preparation followed by analysis using a mass spectrometer high resolution allows to detect the content of the DNA adducts in small DNA probes (100\u00a0ng). We found, that acid hydrolysis is cheaper and more practical in comparison to enzymatic digestion in order to generated samples containing single DNA bases without damaging the structure of adducts.This research was supported by Federal Targeted Programme for Research and Development in Priority Areas of Development of the Russian Scientific and Technological Complex for 2014\u20132020, \u201cDevelopment of molecular signatures for early detection of lung cancer\u201d (No. 14.575.21.0064 from 05.08.2014, RFMEFI57514X0064) and supported by Tomsk State University, Competitiveness Improvement Program\u201d.

     "abstract": "Mutations in BRCA1 and CHEK2 genes associated with hereditary breast cancer were tested in 7920 randomly selected individuals of Novosibirsk (Russia). Mutations BRCA1 5382insC and CHEK2 1100delC were the most frequent, they were found in 0.25% and 0.4% of the general population respectively. We suggested to find mutations carriers by the screening of all breast/ovary cancer patients for the most frequent mutations (BRCA1 5382insC and CHEK2 1100delC) with subsequent analysis of the first-line relatives of cancer patients if one of the mutations was found.From June 2013 till January 2015, all patients from Novosibirsk regional oncology hospital with the diagnosis of breast cancer and some patients with the diagnosis of ovary cancer were tested for mutations BRCA1 5382insC and CHEK2 1100delC. A total of 2655 cancer patients were analyzed independently of their family history. We found 122 mutations carriers, among them 99 patients with mutations in BRCA1 gene and 23 patients with mutation CHEK2 1100delC. Among mutation carriers, 105 patients agreed to have a medical genetic counseling and after pedigree analysis 193 first-line relatives aged above 25 years were elucidated. One hundred ten first-line relatives of mutation carriers were analyzed for the mutations presence and 40 mutations carriers were found among relatives.From September 2013 till December 2013, 32 relatives of BRCA mutation carriers underwent breast MRI. In 5 cases, breast cancer was detected by MRI and all cancers except one were confirmed histologically with biopsy analysis. Importantly, all tumors were 5\u00a0mm and less in size, stage I cancer was detected in all cases.At a follow-up of 1.5\u00a0years, all 105 mutation carrier probands were interviewed by phone regarding possible relapse and/or possible primary cancer in their relatives. Five of 105 probands lost to follow-up may have died. Among responding 100 patients, 2 died as reported by relatives, relapse was reported in 7 probands \u2013 mutation carrier probands, primary tumors were reported in 8 relatives of probands.Mutation carrier probands reported one bilateral breast cancer, four ovary cancers, one bladder cancer and one non-specified oncogynecological tumor.There were five cases of primary breast cancer, one ovary cancer, one colon cancer, one lung cancer among relatives of breast cancer patients with mutations. The frequency of tumors found in mutation carriers exceeded the average frequencies of cancer for this population.The economic value of the regional genetic screening can be easily estimated according to the data obtained in this study and data on treatment cost for stage I and stage IV breast cancer. To summarize briefly, the screening of hot-spot mutations provides not only increase of lifespan expectancy and life quality for mutation carriers, but can be also a tool for financial saving of medical system due to the increase of early stage breast cancer detection.",

After expression of novel genes in tumor cells, tumors may differentiate in new directions and give rise to new cell types, tissues and organs.In the presentation, the bulk of data supporting the positive evolutionary role of tumors will be reviewed, obtained both in the lab of the author and from the literature sources.The following issues will be addressed: the widespread occurrence of tumors in multicellular organisms; features of tumors that could be used in evolution; the relationship of tumors to evo-devo; examples of recapitulation of some tumor features in recently evolved organs; the types of tumors that might play the role in evolution; examples of tumors that already have played the role in evolution.The discussion of experimental confirmation of nontrivial predictions of the hypothesis will include the analysis of evolutionary novelty of tumor-specifically expressed EST sequences; ELFNI \u2013 AS1, a human gene with possible microRNA function expressed predominantly in tumors and originated in primates; PBOV1, a human gene of the recent de novo origin with predicted highly tumor-specific expression profile; and the evolutionary novelty of human cancer/testis antigen genes; the data obtained on transgenic fish tumors regression model; and other data.It can be concluded that expression of protogenes, evolutionarily young and/or novel genes in tumors might be a new biological phenomenon, a phenomenon of carcino-evo-devo genes, predicted by the hypothesis of evolution by tumor neofunctionalization.",

     "abstract": "Combined analyses of molecular data, such as DNA copy-number alteration, mRNA and protein expression, point to biological functions and molecular pathways being deregulated in multiple cancers. Genomic, metabolomic and clinical data from a variety of solid cancers and model systems are emerging and can be used to identify novel patient subgroups for tailored therapy and monitoring. The first solid tumor to be profiled by expression arrays was carcinoma of the breast. The most reproducible classification by mRNA expression is based on the biological entities referred to as the intrinsic subtypes; Luminal A, Luminal B, Basal-like, HER2 enriched, and the Normal-like groups. In the past decade a number of molecular studies to classify breast cancer have added one or two additional molecular levels, most frequently DNA copy number, and gene sequencing. However, few of the studies have integrated more than two levels of information from the same patients. We have in our lab collected several layers of high throughput molecular data, TP53 mutation status and high throughput paired end sequencing on a dataset of 110 patients. This dataset was clustered according to each molecular level studied using an unbiased, unsupervised clustering, and survival KM plots for each patient subgroup was created. While some samples always cluster together at any molecular level, others cluster in different groups according to each particular molecular endpoint. Therefore, we used an integrated approach to understand breast cancer heterogeneity by modeling mRNA, copy number alterations, microRNAs, and methylation in a pathway context utilizing the pathway recognition algorithm using data integration on genomic models (PARADIGM). We show that massive interleukin signaling profiles are observed in invasive cancers and are absent or weakly expressed in healthy tissue but already prominent in ductal carcinoma in situ, together with ECM and cell-cell adhesion regulating pathways. A good correlation was observed between methylation and mRNA expression based classification (p\u00a0=\u00a02.29\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126). Using PARADIGM based on mRNA and miRNA expression, CNAs, and methylation five new clusters with survival differences were revealed. Given the increasing importance of immune constitution for the success of chemotherapy and targeted treatment, this additional information may prove useful in the clinic in the future.",

The metastases (in the liver area) were detected in 6 patients; the remaining patients had no metastases. The degree of lymph node involvement in most patients was not determined, the ten corresponding N1. The control group consisted of 16 healthy people (50\u00a0+\u00a06\u00a0years old). Electric and viscoelastic Er parameters were investigated by dielectrophoresis, their membrane structure \u2013 by TLC and gas chromatography. The optical properties of BS were studied by the methods of ellipsometry. The reaction of the monoclonal antibody CD 24 with BS antigens of CC patients was studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry close to the conditions of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) (ProteOn XPR36 (BioRad).We observed significant differences in Er parameters, associated with the CC stage. Given in the 2nd group (T3\u20134) summarized rigidity, viscosity, electrical conductivity, the relative polarizability, indexes of aggregation and destruction were significantly higher than those in the 1st (T1\u20132) and in the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001\u20130.05). At the same time the patients of the 2nd group had marked disturbances of Er deformability, leading to the development of microcirculatory disorders and tissue hypoxia with the expressed deficit of intracellular macroergs. We observed high levels of cholesterol fraction, oleic, stearic acids, high index of cholesterol/phospholipids (PHL) and low levels of total lipids, easily oxidable PHL, arachidonic acid, omega-3 index in Er membranes in the 2nd group in comparison with those in the 1st group of patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001\u20130.03). Scanning ellipsometry showed marked heterogeneity in thickness and composition, the abundance of discontinuities in thin films of BS of patients in the 2nd group compared to the 1st one (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Increasing the refractive index in combination with the reduction in film thickness as CC stage was weighting has been observed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01\u20130, \u29f9 .05). The concentration of the antigens to the CD24 in the BS of patients (obtained by SPR) in the terminal stages of CC was higher than that in the T1\u20132 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). We revealed correlations between Er parameters, BS ellipsometry characteristics and biochemical parameters, which reflected the interaction between these components depending on the CC stage.Identified microcirculatory disturbances probably aggravate the course of CC and, therefore, require additional therapeutic effects. Differences in Er and BS parameters associated with the stage of CC, give hope for the development of new diagnostic methods at the early stages of the disease.",

     "abstract": "Growing tumor and its microenvironment are capable to produce a number of cytokines that alter the nature of the antitumor surveillance by host immune system.Comparative evaluation of cytokine-producing function of the invasive ductal carcinoma and fibroadenoma of the breast in vitro.Similar biopsies (V\u00a0=\u00a08\u00a0mm3) of the breast tumors were obtained using a special device, cultivated in DMEM F-12 at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 72\u00a0h. Concentrations of the following cytokines: IL-1\u03b2, IL-1Ra, TNF\u03b1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, VEGF and IFN\u03b3 in the supernatant of the tumor were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).The investigation of cytokines level in the supernatant of malignant and benign breast tumors revealed significant differences only in concentrations of IL-10, IL-17, IL-18 and IFN\u03b3 which had a contrary tendency. For example, the concentration of IL-10 was lower at invasive ductal carcinoma in comparison with fibroadenomas. The concentrations of IL-17, IL-18 and IFN\u03b3 at invasive ductal carcinoma were significantly higher than those of breast fibroadenomas. IL-17 and IL-18 are known to be pro-oncogenic cytokines, and the higher the level, the higher the severity of tumor progression. Reduction in the IL-10 concentration might be explained by the already formed neoplasm, which depends on angiogenesis. In this case, IL-10 no longer exerts antiangiogenic action, which contributes to tumor progression. Reduction in the IL-10 concentration, which inhibits the production of IFN\u03b3 leads to an increase in the IFN\u03b3 level. In early stages of tumor development, IFN\u03b3 provides an antitumor effect and at the same time facilitates the selection of a more malignant clones but its pro-tumoral action predominates at advanced stages of tumorigenesis. Moreover, higher concentration of IFN\u03b3 is supposed to be associated with biological effects of IL-18, which is its immediate inductor. In addition, malignant tumor cells are capable to produce their own IL-18, which stimulates tumor progression and facilitates the migration of endothelial cells involved in angiogenesis, which leads to intensified invasion and metastasis.Cytokine production in supernatants of invasive ductal carcinoma compared with fibroadenoma of the breast is characterized by increase in IL-17, IL-18 and IFN\u03b3 concentrations and decrease in IL-10 concentration. Findings suggest the ability of malignant tumor and its microenvironment to secrete the pro-oncogenic cytokines. Fibroadenoma is also able to produce cytokines due to fibroblasts, fibrocytes and some leukocytes in its content.",

The follow-up period was from 1985 to 2014. Both registers operated in the two regions, the most typical for the city. The results can be extrapolated to the entire population of Novosibirsk. For long-term analysis we used data from two registers concerning gastric cancer, colorectal cancer and liver cancer. Morbidity and mortality from stomach cancer over the past 25\u00a0years have declined, however, the proportion of GC 3\u20134 (end-stage) remains constant with a tendency to increase. In general, the incidence of colorectal cancer in the Novosibirsk region remains at a consistently high level, but the detection rates of colon cancer in women have increased. Men were exposed to colorectal cancer more frequently than women, especially in the older age groups. Meanwhile the share of detection of colorectal cancer clinical stage 3\u20134 decreased by one third. With regard to liver cancer, decline was observed over 25\u00a0years that is 2.1 times lower that coincide with national trends. At the same time, death rates from liver cancer in Novosibirsk are lower than in Russia as a whole. However, the index of malignancy (the ratio of mortality to incidence) of liver cancer was 0.94 in Novosibirsk.In summary, while there are a variety of long -term monitoring of trends in the incidence of cancer, this requires new research, especially the identification of genetic markers for the prevention and possible introduction in oncologic patients.",

     "abstract": "The ability to promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment has been recognized as one of the \u201cnext generation\u201d cancer hallmarks, being most apparent in case of HPV-induced carcinogenesis, since it is a prerequisite to the virus persistence and proliferation of keratinocytes expressing HPV-antigens. With respect to HPV-associated cervical cancer, it is commonly known that initial pre-cancerous intraepithelial lesions frequently undergo reverse development due to effective recognition and eradication by the immunocompetent cells. Both innate (e.g. NK) and adaptive (helper and cytotoxic O-cells) arms of immunity have been implicated in the regression of neoplastic cells, with NK T-cells considering as a connecting link between two branches. Progression of intraepithelial neoplasia leads to the establishment of pre-invasive cancer, which can be regarded as the result of a completed immunoediting of the tumor locus, because further, with 100% probability, it turns into invasive metastatic form. We assumed that the signs of immune activation, on the one hand, and the signs of immunosuppression, on the other hand, despite the locality of pre-invasive cervical cancer, can be found in the circulation and can be relevant to the development of tolerogenic microenvironment. The aim of the present work was to investigate the number of functionally different subpopulations of T- and NK-lymphocytes in the blood of patients with pre-invasive cervical cancer.Blood samples were taken from 35 HPV(+) patients diagnosed with cancer in situ. The control group consisted of 30 healthy HPV(\u2212) women with no pathology of the cervix. Lymphocytes were immunophenotyped by MACSQuant flow cytometer. The percentage of the following populations were measured: CD3+CD95+/high, CD3+CD4+, CD3+CD4+CD95+/high, CD3+CD8+, CD3+CD8+CD95+/high, CD4+CD25+, CD4+CD25high, CD4+CD25+CD127dim/neg, CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ (CD4 Tregs), CD8+CD25+, CD8+CD25+CD127dim/neg, CD8+CD25+FoxP3+ (CD8 Tregs), CD3\u2212CD16+, CD3\u2212CD56+, CD3\u2212(CD16\u00b1)CD56bright, CD3\u2212CD16+CD56+, CD3\u2212CD16low/negCD56+, CD3\u2212CD16+CD56- (NK subpopulations), CD3+CD56+, CD3+CD16+CD56+ (NK T-lymphocytes).Increase in the number of CD4 Tregs that are known to exert immunosuppressive effect was found in cancer patients\u2019 group, namely the increased quantity of cells with CD4+CD25+ (especially, CD4+CD25high fraction), CD4+CD25+CD127dim/neg, or CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ phenotypes was shown. At the same time, the portion of CD4+FoxP3+ lymphocytes didn\u2019t differ between the studied groups. A rare population of CD8+ Tregs (CD8+CD25+CD127dim/negFoxP3+) also exhibited a tendency to accumulate in the blood of cancer patients compared with the control. Analysis of the major subpopulation of NK cells performing cytotoxic reactions didn\u2019t reveal significant difference between the examined groups. Similar result was obtained in relation to the other functional groups of NK cells, specifically CD3\u2212CD16\u00b1CD56bright (cytokine-producing NKs with low cytotoxicity), CD3\u2212CD16dim/\u2212CD56+ (NKs with potential anti-tumor activity), and CD3\u2212CD16+CD56 \u2013 (NKs associated with viral infection or NK-precursors). However, an increase of NK T-lymphocyte amounts was established, arguing both activation of anti-tumor response and its inhibition, in view of functional polymorphism of this population. Similarly, the increased number of CD3+CD95+/high cells and CD3+CD4+CD95+/high T-helpers may have dual significance, taking into account that the mid-early T-cell activation marker CD95/Fas presents the key death-receptor (earlier we have revealed the elevated activity of caspases involved in the Fas-mediated signaling in circulating lymphocytes of cervical cancer patients). The total numbers of CD3+CD4+ T-helpers and CD3+CD8+ T-killers were generally comparable between the groups analyzed, with T-killers displaying slightly decreased percentage in the patient group.The processes supporting establishment of immunosuppressive microenvironment extend beyond the local level during the earliest steps of cervical cancer progression. The observed changes may reflect the shift of equilibrium between immune activation and suppression, which is the essence of immunoediting. Further phenotypic analysis of cell subpopulations reported here is required for understanding the functional meaning of these changes.The study was supported by the grants NK-1404-32098, 11.G34.31.0052, the Program of strategic development of PetrSU for 2012-2016, and the State task for R&D.",

     "abstract": "HER2 is a known driver of breast cancer progression in 15\u201330% of primary breast carcinomas and an important target for therapy. More recently, it was established that transcript splice variants of HER2, including delta16-HER2, herstatin, p100 participate in malignant progression and drug resistance. Exosomes are small vesicles of endocytic origin, which are released by many different cell types and can be used as potential novel biomarkers, since they contain DNA and RNA derived from cancer cells. The aim of this study is to explore the use of exosomes for detecting HER2 splice variants and compare levels HER2 splice variants in cells and their exosomes.Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB- 231, MCF7, MCF7-Adr and BT549 were grown as monolayer cultures as recommended by American Type Culture Collection. The exosomes were isolated by an ultracentrifugation protocol. Total RNA was isolated and cDNA was generated to be used for classic PCR and SYBR Green I quantitative (q) PCR.We determined HER2 splice variants levels in MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines and in exosomes derived from MDA-MB-36. MDA-MB-361 cells expressed high levels of full length HER2 mRNA, delta16-HER2 mRNA, whereas no expression was detected in other cell lines. Exosomes derived from MDA-MB-231 cells line were negative for Herstatin, delta16-HER2 and p100 but positive for mRNA of full length HER2.The absence of HER2 mRNA and splice variants in MCF7, MCF7-Adr and BT549 cells lines corresponded to their absence in exosomes. Although the other cell lines remain to be examined, we speculate that exosomes will reflect the HER2 splice variants content present in the breast cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "Genotoxic stress induces significant changes in expression rates of regulatory proteins inside transformed cells. Since some of these proteins are short-lived ones and they undergo rapid proteasomal degradation, combined treatment with genotoxic agent (doxorubicin) and proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib) should launch accumulation of these proteins in cancer cells. This accumulation is even more characteristic for the multiple myeloma cells due to their high synthetic potential.We investigated the pattern of regulatory proteins associated with PSMA3 subunit of 20S proteasome core. PSMA3 is engaged into ubiquitin-independent degradation of several proteins known to contribute in cancer development (I\u03baB\u03b1, p21WAF1/CIP1). We suppose, that the proteins revealed may either be directed to undergo ubiquitin-independent proteolysis, or possess proteasome-regulating activity, and changes in their abundance may not only serve as an evidence of some treatment-induced changes, but also may be considered as biomarkers of the therapies efficiency.RPMI 8226 multiple myeloma cell line was used as a model object. Before the actual treatment the proper apoptosis-inducing concentrations of doxorubicin and bortezomib were determined in order to avoid necrosis. PSMA3-interacting proteins were isolated by incubation with GST-PSMA3 fusion protein attached to glutathione sepharose beads, 2D-electrophoretically separated and identified by MALDI TOF/TOF mass-spectrometry.As a result we obtained heterogeneous list of proteins that can be functionally divided into 12 subgroups: RNA turnover regulators, chaperones and chaperonines, metabolic regulators, translation factors, cytoskeleton proteins, mitochondrial proteins, transcriptional regulators, subunits of proteasomal regulatory complexes, and several minor groups housing single members. Due to their function and metabolism inside the cell some of the identified proteins seem to be promising for the further investigation; among them are HuR, TUSC1 (Tumour Suppressor Candidate), several hnRNP representatives, numerous chaperones (GRP78 in particular). Presence of these proteins was additionally confirmed with immunoblotting assay, which pattern also gave several promising guidelines for further elaboration of the data. To exemplify, ELAVL1 (HuR) protein is known to be a protector of mRNAs for c-myc, c-fos and some other proteins stabilising them via binding AU-rich sequences in 3\u2032-UTR. As far as proteasomes are also capable to recognise these motifs and moreover possess RNAse activity, these two processes might compete within the cell. According to immunoblotting patterns after drug treatment of the cells HuR is significantly accumulated; this supports our assumption of it being degraded via proteasome-independent proteolysis. Relying on the obtained data this hypothesis and several others are being tested.Present work was supported by RFBR (Projects 12-04-01397 and 15-04-04541).",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer among women aged 40\u201369\u00a0years. According to WHO, about 1 million new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed annually worldwide, and nearly 500,000 die from it. In Russia, more than 55,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer annually, and more than 22,000 die from it. Diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer is the primary and important social and medical problem.The increased expression of: (a) ER and PgR (70\u201375% of all cases of breast cancer) is an indication for hormone therapy, which is one of the simplest and most effective methods of systemic treatment of breast cancer; (b) receptor HER2/neu is a marker of highly aggressive form of breast cancer and indication for the use of targeted therapy Gertseptin; (c) proliferative factor Ki-67 reflects the ability of a tumor to metastasize.Today, the \u201cgold standard\u201d of gene expression diagnostic of ER, PgR, HER2/neu and Ki-67 in breast cancer is immunohistochemistry (IHC) using foreign test systems (Ventana, Dako Inc, USA) . However, IHC diagnostics has some significant drawbacks. It leads up to 15\u201317% of cases of incorrect choice of drug therapy, which based on incorrect results of IHC studies. As a result, the significant group of patients do not receive effective treatment. Aim of the study Aim: the development a prototype of diagnostic test system for detection the receptor status of breast cancer, based on RT-PCR.Breast cancersamples consisted of 45 fresh-frozen tissue (FFT) samples of breast cancer (sites of malignant transformation and normal tissue from the same patients) and 59 FFPET sampleswere collected. All the samples had the IHC characteristic of receptor status of ER, PgR, HER2/neu and proliferation factor Ki-67 (Dako Inc., USA). Samples were submitted by SBIH NR \u201cNovosibirsk Regional Oncology Center\u201d (Novosibirsk, Russia). The experimental part of the study was divided into several stages: separation of mRNA from cells, obtaining cDNA (reverse transcription reaction), PCR in real-time and validation of the test system. Isolation of total RNA from FFT samples was performed using a set of \u201cSV Total RNA Isolation system\u201d according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Promega, USA). Isolation of total RNA from FFPET samples was performed using a set \u201cReliaPrep FFPE Total RNA Miniprep System\u201d (Promega, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The concentration of total RNA was determined using a NanoDrop 1000 microspectrophotometer (Thermo Bioscience, USA) (RNA concentration were 15\u2013660\u00a0ng/ml).For the reverse transcription reaction (RT) and PCR, the main parameters were selected. For RT: RNA incubation time and temperature of the reaction, enzyme concentration in the reaction mix. For PCR: the amount of DNA template, the number of primers, the concentration of magny ions, the concentration of the polymerase. Validation of the developed test system was carried out by comparing the results obtained by RT-PCR with the results of the IHC analysis of the same samples. Statistical processing of the research results was performed using the MedCalc program v.14.12.0 (Microsoft Corp.).We have considered modern advanced methods of diagnostic of breast cancer receptor status. It was concluded that the use of RT-PCR in real time technology is the best alternative technology of the IHC, which currently is the standard definition of the expression of ER, PgR, HER2/neu and Ki-67. Prototype of test system for the detection of ER, PgR, HER2/neu and Ki67 proliferative factor in breast cancer samples was designed and optimized by RT-PCR.",

     "abstract": "Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used in treatment of many cancer types due to its ability to induce apoptosis in malignant cells in blood cancer therapy, and to prevent nausea, emesis and chemotherapy-associated hepatotoxicity in case of solid tumors. However, severe dose-limiting side effects occur, including osteoporosis, diabetes and other metabolic complications. Moreover, in therapy of solid tumors GCs strongly affect microenvironment which could be associated with poor prognosis, risk of metastasis and high frequency of relapses.Biological response to GCs is mediated by glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a well-characterized transcription factor. GR controls gene expression via (1) transactivation, which requires binding of GR homodimers to glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE) in gene promoters and enhancers, and (2) dimerization-independent transrepression mediated via negative interaction between GR and other transcription factors including major effectors of inflammation and proliferation. Transrepression plays an important role in anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects of GR, including normalizing influence on microenvironment, while side effects are associated with GR transactivation. In particular, GCs induce insulin resistance in adipocytes, a major component of the mammary microenvironment, which secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, implicated in tumor progression. Selective GR agonists (SEGRA) that preferentially activate GR transrepression could be a better option for treatment of cancer.Dozens of candidate SEGRAs were identified, synthesized and tested by industry and academia, with some having reached clinical trials. One of the novel GR modulators is 2-(4-acetoxyphenyl)-2-chloro-N-methylethylammonium-chloride, or CpdA, synthetic analogue of aziridine precursor isolated from Namibian shrub Salsola tuberculatiformis Botschantzev. It was shown that CpdA acts as \u201cdissociated\u201d GR ligand: it competes with GCs for GR binding and efficiently induces GR transrepression but not transactivation. We and other authors reported recently that CpdA inhibits survival of prostate cancer cells as well as blood cancer cells in GR-dependent fashion. Furthermore, primary leukemia cells from T-ALL patients appeared to be equally sensitive to GCs and CpdA.Our further studies were concentrated on three directions:(1) GC/SEGRA-based chemotherapy. We screened biological effect of CpdA in combination with traditional agents (doxorubicin, vincristine) and newer therapeutics (Bortezomib, Carfilzomib, MLN-4924, Rapamycin). Pretreatment of lymphoma cells with proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib resulted in GR accumulation and enhanced ligand properties of CpdA. We also revealed remarkable GR-dependent cooperation between CpdA and Bortezomib in suppressing survival of lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Also surprising findings were substantial cooperation in anti-cancer effect of immunosuppressant Rapamycin and CpdA in vitro, and unexpected \u201cdissociated\u201d effect of Rapamycin on GR signaling realized through down -regulation of REDD1, mTORC1 inhibitor. These data suggested high clinical potential of Rapamycin/GC combination in cancer treatment.(2) SEGRA list extentionWe used two approaches to extend SEGRA list: (1) synthesis of CpdA enantiomers and (2) its chemical derivatives. Chemical analogues of CpdA were designed by appending of bulky substituent into benzene ring, alkylation of carbon atom adjacent to chlorine atom or appending of substituents to nitrogen atom. Evaluation of biological properties of enantiomers revealed higher GR-dependent anti-cancer potential of S-CpdA. Cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects of CpdA analogues were comparable with precursor.(3) Selection of tumor types acceptable for SEGRA treatment.CpdA was selected for NCI-60 in Vitro Cell Line Screening Project providing direct support to anticancer drug discovery program. It was shown that CpdA affect viability of some adherent cancer cell lines. We demonstrated that CpdA unlike GCs did not modify microenvironment and disintegrate tight junctions between cells decreasing risk of metastasis in case of solid tumors. It demonstrates reasonability of further investigations.Overall, our data provide the rationale for novel therapy of cancer based on combination of non-steroidal GR modulators with classic and modern chemotherapeutics. Approaches to obtain more SEGRAs were elaborated.",

     "abstract": "There are numerous evidences suggesting that tumor evolution follows the laws of Darwinian evolution, whereby individual tumor cell clones have private genetic aberrations, including chromosomal abnormalities. The combined effect of genetic instability and differential selective pressures of the microenvironment and chemotherapy can result in the creation of new tumor clones (Navin et al., 2011; Ng et al., 2012). The aim of this study is to show breast tumor clonal evolution during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) using microarray analysis.Breast cancer patients (n\u00a0=\u00a026) with stage IIA to IIIC (T1-4N0-3M0), were treated with NAC (FAC or CAX regimens). DNA was extracted from 26 samples of tumor tissue derived before or after NAC using QIAamp DNA mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Copy Number Aberrations (CNA, deletions and amplifications, or Loss and Gain, respectively) and number of mutant clones were detected in pre- and post-NAC tumor samples using the high density microarray platform Affymetrix (USA) CytoScanTM HD Array. This study was approved by Tomsk Cancer Research Institute review board.We have revealed that 19% (5/26) of patients during the NAC showed the decrease in the number of mutant clones and CNA frequency right up to their complete elimination (genetic regression) at one case. In 7 (27%) cases chemotherapy had no any effect on number of mutant clones and the frequency of CNA in tumor. In the tumors of 10 patients the elimination of some mutant clones as well as the formation of new clones with deleted genetic material occurred under the influence of chemotherapy. 6 patients have demonstrated the appearance of new tumor clones with gene amplifications which were associated with the development of metastases in 83% of cases (5/6). All other patients (n\u00a0=\u00a021) who has not acquired the new tumor clones with Gain function mutation after NAC did not manifest distant metastasis in 5-year follow-up (Kaplan\u2013Meier, p\u00a0=\u00a00.00001 Log-rank test).The first time evidence is presented that the formation of new tumor clones may occur during the NAC. Metastasis of breast cancer is associated with the appearance of new clones with DNA amplifications.

     "abstract": "Cutaneous melanoma is one of the most aggressive human neoplasms that can quickly metastasize to regional lymph nodes. Currently, prognosis is determined by measuring tumor thickness but more reliable markers for metastatic spread are urgently needed. It is well known that tumors require a microvasculature development in order to grow and metastasize. Angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis play an important role not only in the tumor growth, but also in the tumor metastasis. As malignancy is a disorder of cellular growth control, the assessment of cell proliferation rates in tumors has intuitive appeal as a prognostic marker. One such biomarker is Ki-67, a cell cycle dependent protein. Recent reports related to its role as a prognostic factor have been contradictory. The purpose of this study was to investigate lymphangiogenesis, angiogenesis and tumor tissue proliferative activity depending on the clinical stages of melanoma.The objects of the study were the samples of tumor tissue obtained during surgical treatment of cutaneous malignant melanoma. To analyze tumor angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis and proliferation, we performed immunostains of the primary melanomas for the vascular marker CD34, for the lymphatic-specific markers LYVE-1, D2 -40 (Podoplanin) and marker of proliferation \u2013 Ki-67. Samples of tumor tissue from 40 patients with IA, IB, IIA, IIB, IIIC melanoma stages were fixed in 10% neutral formalin, processed by standard histological techniques and embedded in paraffin. All steps of the immunohistochemical reaction were performed by using BENCHMARK/XT slide stainer (Ventana).Determination of blood vessel volume density revealed its growth an average of 2 times in peritumoral areas. Similar data were obtained about the location lymphatic vessels. Greater content peritumoral blood and lymphatic vessels, then intratumoral could be detected in all stages of melanoma. In addition more significantly greater volume density both intratumoral and peritumoral blood vessels, than lymphatic vessels was found. A greater degree expression of endothelium lymphatic vessels markers Podoplanin, compared with the LYVE-1 was shown. It was noted an increasing volume density of the peritumoral blood and lymphatic vessels in primary tumors with expansion clinical stage melanoma. Three levels of proliferative activity of tumor tissue were determined (low, an average degree and high Ki-67 expression). Results of the analysis have shown, that the high proliferative activity corresponded to significant content of blood and lymphatic vessels. High level of these markers was observed in patients with regional lymph nodes metastases.In recent years there have been appeared publications suggesting that lymphatic vessel density (particularly in a peritumoral location) and lymphatic vessel invasion are predictors of sentinel node metastasis and poorer survival. It was noted, that \u201clarger, carefully conducted and well-reported studies that confirm these preliminary findings are required before it would be appropriate to recommend the routine application of costly and time-consuming immunohistochemistry for lymphatic markers in the routine clinical assessment of primary cutaneous melanomas\u201d. In our opinion, one must consider not only the lymphatic vessels density, but also blood vessels, and the tumor tissue proliferative activity.This study has shown that the complex markers of lymphangiogenesis (Podoplanin), angiogenesis (CD34) and proliferation (Ki-67) may be predictors of high risk early melanoma metastasis.",

In this paper we performed the study of the relative evolutionary novelty of human oncogenes, all protein-coding genes, genes encoding tumor antigens, tumor suppressors and tumor-associated genes using homology searches in genomes of different taxa in human lineage.The following databases were used as a source of human genes: oncogenes \u2013 COSMIC (574 genes), tumor suppressors \u2013 TSGene (636 genes), all tumor-associated genes \u2013 allOnco (2116 genes) and NCG (2001 genes), cancer-testis (CT) antigen genes \u2013 CTDatabase (276 genes) and all annotated human protein coding genes \u2013 Genome assembly GRCh38 (21694 genes). The list of cancer vaccine antigen genes was retrieved from paper of Cheever et al., 2007, where 75 cancer antigens were ranked according to their potential suitability for anticancer vaccines. Some of cancer antigens are non-protein molecules, mutant or fusion-proteins. Thus, we examined the evolutionary novelty of only 58 protein-coding cancer vaccine antigen genes. To analyze the evolutionary novelty of the explored genes the HomoloGene release 68 tool and ProteinHistorian tool were used. The HomoloGene tool searches the orthologs in 11 taxa of the human lineage (Eukaryota, Opisthokonta, Bilateria, Euteleostomi, Tetrapoda, Amniota, Boreoeutheria, Euarchontoglires Catarrhini, Homininae, H.sapiens) and the ProteinHistorian tool searches the orthologs in 16 taxa of the human ligeage (Cellular Organisms, Eukaryota, Opisthokonta, Bilateria, Deuterostomia, Chordata, Euteleostomi, Tetrapoda, Amniota, Mammalia, Theria, Eutheria, Euarchontoglires, Catarrhini, Homininae, H.sapiens). To analyze the statistical significance of data Fisher\u2019s exact test was used.Several curves of taxonomic distribution of orthologs of different classes of human genes have been generated. A set of curves forms a peculiar picture where different curves are organized in a definite order. The curves never intersect after Bilateria. The uppermost position occupies the curve which describes the oncogene orthologs distribution. Right below the oncogene curve, the distribution curve of tumor suppressor genes orthologs taxonomic is located, and the difference between these curves is significant. The distribution curves of other tumor-associated genes orthologs overlap with tumor suppressor curve. The medium position in the whole picture is occupied by the distribution curve of orthologs of all human protein-coding genes. Below this curve the distribution curves of orthologs of different tumor antigens are located. The first below the medium curve is tumor vaccine antigen curve, then CT and CT-X antigen genes orthologs distribution curves are located. Thus at any given timepoint the relative proportion of oncogene orthologs described by distribution curve is higher than of any other studied class of human genes.1. The evolution of human oncogenome advances ahead of all other human gene classes. 2. On the other hand, the evolution of tumor antigen gene classes goes behind the rest of human gene classes, i.e. tumor antigens genome is more evolutionary novel.",

     "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) is a multifunctional cytokine, which possesses various biologic functions depending on the type of the cells and the physiological context. TNF is synthesized by immune cells as well as malignant cells. Accordingly, TNF plays an important role in the tumor and microenvironment communication as well as systemic response to the disease. TNF gene is located at HLA class III gene locus (6p21.3) and contains several sites of single nucleotide polymorphisms in promoter, which modify TNF gene expression. G to A substitution at position \u2212238 (rs361525) decreases TNF gene expression whereas the G to A substitution at position \u2212308 (rs1800629) increases the expression. Studies on the possible association of these polymorphisms with various malignancies risk yielded contradictory results depending on ethnicity. Breast cancer (BC) is a multifactorial disease with clinicomorphological heterogeneity. Pathways of the main BC associated molecules (ER, PR, Her2) have crossroads with TNF signaling. The goal of the study was to identify possible TNF polymorphism effects on BC predisposition and prognosis in Russian patients.DNA from 413 women with newly diagnosed BC and 226 women without oncological, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases (control group) was examined. Allelic variants of \u2212238(G/A) TNF were determined by a RFLP-PCR, the \u2212308(G/A) TNF polymorphism was analyzed by allele-specific PCR. Additionally Ile655Val HER2 polymorphism was tested by RFLP-PCR in142 BC patients. The comparison of genotypes frequencies was performed using the Fisher\u2019s exact test. Overall survival (OS) rate of BC patients was the criterion for estimation of polymorphism prognostic significance and was analyzed by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The Log-rank test was used for the comparison of different groups of patients. The difference was considered as statistically significant at p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.A minor allele \u2212238(A) was found in 10% BC patients and in 7% women from control group. In the same way allele \u2212308(A) was found with a close frequency in BC patients and controls (25% and 22%). It worth to note that allele A was found in two position simultaneously in <1% of persons only. So, we failed to reveal the association of both TNF polymorphisms with BC predisposition. We did not reveal genotype distribution disparities among groups with various stages of BC and the level of ER, PR and Her2 expression. While highly active allele Val655 HER2 was more frequent in BC patients with allele \u2212238(A) then without substitution (75% and 39%, accordingly, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We found that 10-year OS of BC patients was significantly lower in the presence of allele \u2212238(A) than without it in groups possessed regional metastases (43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013% and 72\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.005) or ER\u00a0+\u00a0PR\u00a0+\u00a0tumor(63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017% and 89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.02). An opposite relationship was obtained in the presence of allele \u2212308(A) then without the substitution when the tumor size was more than 5\u00a0cm (10-year OS 69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012% and 40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08%, accordingly, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).This study found out the opposite effect of polymorphisms at \u2212238 and \u2212308 positions in TNF promoter on the outcome of BC patients. Carriers of low expressed allele \u2212238(A) have poor outcome because of low response to standard hormone therapy which presumably connected with the activation of Her2 pathway. The obtained results allow supposing that a special approach to the treatment of this group of BC patients should be used.",

     "abstract": "The origin of evolutionary novel genes is connected with the origin and evolution of the novel organismal functions and the increase in morphological complexity of multicellular organisms. Novel gene acquire new or altered functions. Here we describe that evolutionary novel genes, expressed predominantly in transgenic fish tumors after their induced regression, determine progressive evolutionary characters and are conserved in human.We used a sample of genes, which were activated in inducible krasV12 transgenic zebrafish tumors according to the results of RNASeq data. Genes from our sample were expressed after HCC regression upon kras inactivation. The search of orthologs by different tools, such as blastx and psiblast, with e-value cut off not less than 10\u20133 and query coverage more than 50%, discovered that considerable proportion of tumor-specifically expressed genes are evolutionary novel, i.e. their orthologs are not found in Lamprey. Nine tenths of these novel genes have orthologs in humans. Gene ontology (GO) data were used to analyze their functions. According to the results of GO, some of the genes have functions not characteristic to fish. Among known functions of the human orthologues of evolutionary novel genes of zebrafish (vs. Lamprey) there are some important morphogenetic functions. For example, genes ccdc40, lmx1ba and lepa acquired functions in lung, embryonic utera and placenta, i.e. organs originated in taxa higher than fish. A large proportion of genes from our sample are connected with retina type eye, heart and brain development.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma is one of the most malignant cancer types. Its median survival is 15\u00a0months with combined radio- and chemotherapy and only 4\u00a0months without therapy. Molecular chaperones play a very multifaced role in tumor development. Depletion of Hdj1 in cancer cells accelerates tumor growth. Decrease of Hdj2 level correlates with the increase of tumor aggressiveness, but also attenuates tumor protection against radiotherapy. Hsp70 provides considerable survival advantages to the cancer cells, but at the same time can act as a \u201cchaperokine\u201d, activating antitumoral immunity. For assessment of chaperone\u2019s role in glioma progression, invasiveness and metastasis formation we chose rat model of intracranial injection of 105 C6 cells. We developed three C6-based cell lines with protein knock-down by RNA-interference: C6 shHsp70 (on 83%), C6 shHdj1 (on 96%) and C6 shHdj2 (on 52%). The last differed in roundish and easily detachable morphology. Following intracranial injection of the modified tumor cells, the animals\u2019 survival was estimated. As compared to the groups of control C6 (25.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9\u00a0days) and C6 shHdj1 (25.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8) we observed a nearly 1.5-fold decrease in survival in C6 shHdj2 (16.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5\u00a0days) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). On the contrary, in C6 shHsp70 group the survival increased up to 42.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.0\u00a0days (the increase is completely explainable by the slower growth rate of the culture). Subsequent MR imaging and histological analysis of tumors demonstrated elevated invasiveness and metastatic activity in C6 shHdj2 group in comparison to C6 shHsp70, C6 shHdj1 and control C6. High migration activity and the ability of floating C6 shHdj2 cells to adhere and settle on the substrate was proved in wound-healing assay, spot-healing assay, colony forming assay and transwell migration assay. Adhesion assay showed decreased adhesion ability of C6 shHdj2 cells and increased \u2013 of C6 shHsp70 cells on all types of tested extracellular matrixes. Immunofluorescence analyses showed loss of membrane- expressed N-cadherin and loss of intercellular contacts mediated by N-cadherin in C6 shHdj2 cells in comparison to other considered cell lines (although its level in western blot was elevated). Actin staining with rhodamine-falloidin revealed highly abundant leading edges in C6 shHdj2 culture. Matrix metalloprotease zymography proved an increased activity in gelatinases (mmp2 and mmp9) as well as in caseinases (mmp1 and mmp8) in C6 shHdj2 culture supernatant. Assay of stemness marker CD133 expression showed its 11.8 times increase in C6 shHdj2.Our experiments proved the high importance of Hdj2 level in glioma progression, invasion and metastasis.",

     "abstract": "multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major problem in the fight against tumors. MDR \u2013 multidimensional phenomenon, which occurs as a consequence of activation of several systems, associated both with the release of xenobiotics from the cell by ABC-transporters, and with stimulation of pathways that enhance cell survival. One of the possible regulators of MDR is multifunctional protein YB-1. YB-1 acting as a transcription factor in cell\u2019s nucleus, can upregulate expression of MDR1, as well as some other ABC-transporters genes. Furthermore, YB-1 is secreted by cells and binds to the protein Notch3, and that stimulates proliferation and migration of cells. Also, resistance of cells may increase upon stimulation of VEGF-VEGER systems. Our aim was to study the mechanisms of MDR at various levels in the pairs of parental and resistant breast cancer cells: changes in the expression and localization of YB-1, evaluation expression of ABC-transporters, activation of protein Notch, as well as changes in the VEGF system.Long-term cultivation of cells MCF-7 (breast adenocarcinoma) and HBL-100 (transformed cells) in the presence of doxorubicin to obtain resistant sublines, MTT assay,real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, flow cytofluorometry.we obtained the sublines of cells MCF-7 and HBL-100 resistant to doxorubicin: MCF-7/D7 and HBL-100/D85, respectively. The level of resistance to doxorubicin in resistant MCF-7/D6 was 7 times higher than in parent MCF-7 (IC50 was 0.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mcM vs 0.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002\u00a0mcM, respectively), and the level of resistance HBL-100/D85 was 44.7 times higher than the HBL-100 (IC50 8.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17\u00a0mcM vs 0.19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0mcM). Also, MCF-7/D7 acquired cross-resistance to cisplatin (6.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0mcM vs 48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mcM) and paclitaxel (2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03\u00a0nM vs 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0nM), but not to vinblastine and 5-fluorouracil, and HBL-100/D85 \u2013 about 100 times to paclitaxel (13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0nM vs 1100\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019\u00a0nM) and vinblastine (2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0nM vs 250\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0nM), but not to the cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. The expression profile of ABC-transporter genes showed significant activation of the MDR1 expression in subline HBL-100/D85 (more than 1000 times), but not in MCF-7/D6.Expression of other genes of the family ABC-transporters - MRP1, BCRP, MVP - increased slightly. Expression of mRNA YB-1 was almost unchanged. YB-1 protein detected in cytoplasm of parental lines, but it detected in nuclei in resistant sublines. Also, protein Notch3 translocated from membrane into nucleus. Evaluation of VEGF expression profile revealed that in a couple of VEGFA-VEGFR2 didn\u2019t occur any changes. However, we observed a significant upregulation of expression mRNA VEGFC and down-regulation of mRNA VEGFR3 in resistant sublines MCF-7/D6 and HBL-100/D85.the results of our study show that the appearance of MDR associated with various changes in cells. Common changes in the resistant sublines were translocation of protein YB-1 and Notch3 in cells nuclei, as well as the dynamics of expression changes in pair VEGFCVEGFR3.The last observation is an interesting finding and requires more detailed study.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetic biomarkers including aberrantly methylated DNA (amDNA) and non-coding RNA such as microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in biological fluids represent markers with the highest potential for cancer diagnostics. Tumor-specific amDNA is more easily and efficiently detected in blood plasma/serum in presence of large excess of wild type DNA compared with mutated DNA. miRNAs are much more stable than coding mRNA and are present in blood in detectable amounts. However still only a few cell-free DNA (cfDNA) -based diagnostics detecting epigenetic markers have come to the market. The main limitations of aberrantly methylated cfDNA (am-cfDNA) markers are age- and tissue-specific DNA methylation, low concentration of tumor-specific DNA along with presence of any conceivable methylated DNA pattern in circulation (Korshunova, 2009). Potential miRNA markers selection demands large scale primary analysis and overcoming some analytical complication like efficiency and uniformity of miRNA isolation and normalization at verification step.To overcome limitations of am-cfDNA use we utilized two approaches:Biased comprising selection of markers valid for tumor tissues, elaboration of the demands for inclusion/exclusion of cfDNA samples, development of PCR with absolute specificity and sensitivity of 1\u201310 molecules per sample, increasing of cfDNA concentration in the analytical sample. Epigenomics GA successfully used this approach for the EpiColon test development.Unbiased comprising search for potential markers in cfDNA/cfRNA using modern methods including MPS and subsequent bioinformatics data analysis, formulation of the requirements to analytical systems based on MPS data, development and validation of the diagnostics.Using first approach we selected 4 markers from 5 studied which proposed diagnostic value for lung cancer. Analytical sensitivity of methyl-specific TagMan PCR for these 4 genes and a control gene are 2, 3, 4, 10 and 10 copies of methylated DNA in 1000-fold excess of unmethylated DNA, correspondingly. Diagnostic sensitivity of lung cancer detection in the training group (30 healthy, 30 lung cancer patients, training cohort) for 4 genes are 13%, 46%, 73%, 30%, specificity \u2013 100%, 97%, 100%, 97%, respectively. Inclusion/exclusion criteria are based on a control gene concentration in blood plasma. 2 markers in combination provide 89%sensitivity of lung cancer diagnostics and 97% specificity, 3 markers in combination demonstrate sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 97%.Unbiased approach included locus-specific MPS using MiSeq platform of 2 aberrantly methylated genes amplified with methyl-independent primers (barcoded individually) after bisulfite conversion of cfDNA isolated from blood of 18 healthy donors (HD), 20 prostate cancer (PC) and 17 benign prostatic hyperplasia patients (BPH). Analysis of individual methylation patterns and their representation demonstrates that methylation of GSTP1 gene-located 4 CpG-pairs in cfDNA from healthy donors differs compared with PC patients. Logistic regression-based model of 4 CpG-pairs methylation demonstrates 95% specificity and 100% sensitivity of PC diagnostics.Looking for miRNA markers 20 primary lung cancer patients (14 \u2013 squamous cell carcinoma, 6 \u2013 adenocarcinoma) and 10 healthy donors were enrolled in the study (training cohort). Circulating miRNAs were isolated by one-step phenol-free protocol (Zaporozhchenko et al., 2015). Concentrations of 179 miRNAs were measured in circulating miRNA pool by miRCURY LNA microRNA PCR Serum/Plasma Panel (Exiqon Ltd, Denmark). 18 miRNAs were differentially expressed between groups of healthy donors and patients with squamous cell carcinoma. 2 miRNAs provide 85% and 79% diagnostic sensitivity with 100% specificity. Verification using qRT-TaqMan PCR on a testing cohort including 75 lung cancer patients (squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma) and 50 healthy donors demonstrates 66% sensitivity and 89% specificity of the best selected miRNA.In conclusion, wide scale modern methods demonstrate high efficacy for epigenetic cfNA cancer markers development, whereas conventional approaches based on the current experience have not yet exhausted their potential.",

     "abstract": "To study the impact of oxidative stress acute hypoxia and reperfusion on HeLa cervical cancer cell attachment, survival and invasion capacities.Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism of port-site metastases (PSM). We presumed that CO2 exposure results in hypoxia and reperfusion with subsequent oxidative stress of cancer cells being a triggering mechanism of PSM.Two CO2-pneumoperitoneum conditions were created: the hypoxic standard model (HSM) and oxidative stress model (OSM) upon CO2 insufflation and reperfusion by means of in vitro cell culture tools and non-exposed cells were served as intact control. HeLa cervical cancer cells were exposed under these CO2 insufflation conditions. Subsequently, HeLa cell attachment, viability and proliferation capacities were evaluated in duplicate samples as series I and II by the MTT and SRB assays and invasion by the Matrigel invasion assay and repeated in triplicate experiments. The impact of different CO2-pneumoperitoneum conditions on cancer cell attachment was evaluated immediately after exposure, whereas invasion capacity after 48\u00a0h of incubation and survival and proliferation every 24\u00a0h for 72\u00a0h.Both CO2 insufflation models significantly affected HeLa cell attachment activity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in comparison with that of non-exposed cells. CO2 insufflation by HSM resulted in significantly pronounced weakening of HeLa cell attachment as compared to exposure of these cells to insufflation by OSM (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Both pneumoperitoneum regimes significantly weakened HeLa cell invasion capacity in comparison with those of controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas HSM profoundly decreased HeLa cell invasion capacity in comparison with that of OSM (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).An in vitro model of oxidative stress during CO2-pneumoperitoneum increased HeLa cancer cell invasion capacity in comparison with standard CO2-pneumoperitoneum condition with continuous CO2 insufflation. Oxidative stress followed by acute hypoxia and reperfusions during deflations can increase cancer cell attachment and survival capacity, and may trigger cancer cell invasion and metastasis. These data suggest that a regime of laparoscopic procedures may affect attachment and invasion of cancer cells and hence can explain the occurrence of port-site cancer metastasis.",

Fresh frozen biopsies and adjacent normal epithelium were used. The diagnosis was verified by histology. All qRT-PCR data were analyzed using the Pfaffl analysis. Multiplex RT-PCR on miRNA templates were performed as described by Chen et al. (2005). TaqMan miRNA assays (Iyevleva et al., 2012) were used to quantify expression of mature miRNAs of interest (miR-18a, -21, -155, -200a, -200c, -205, -221, -494). Data were analyzed using Welsh t-test with a 5% FDR correction. According to our results, aberrant expression of some miRNAs was showed. There was no significant differences in miRNA expression in a total group (n\u00a0=\u00a025) although a trend towards overexpression of oncogenic miRNA-21 and -155 according to severity of dysplastic changes in a tissue were present. Detailed analysis showed significant overexpression of that miRNAs as well as miRNA-200c and -205 in a group of dysplasia II- III against control group (15 vs 10, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019, p\u00a0=\u00a00.045 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.020, p\u00a0=\u00a00.038, respectively) but these results did not meet 5% FDR correction.Data showed overexpression of the same microRNA (-205, -155, -200 and -21) in larynx cancer patients compared to control group (46 vs 15, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009, p\u00a0=\u00a00.013, respectively). It should be pointed that microRNA pattern both in larynx cancer and patients with dysplasia II-III was very close showing similarity of these groups at molecular level. Frequency of cases with microRNA-205 overexpression was 2.98 times higher in cancer patients than in those who had no malignant transformation (CI 95%, 1.41\u201316.26, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Data showed that up regulation of microRNA-205 could be a marker of disease progression (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.79). Three other microRNAs did not show any promising results as biomarkers of cancer progression but data obtained has interesting fundamental value.These miRs (-21, -155, -205 and -200c) are known to be regulators of processes that play an emergent role in carcinogenesis and our results obtained in vivo highlight and expand knowledge about some aspects of larynx cell transformation. Data suggest that miRNAs changing its expression according to dysplasia progress and could be important players in complex process of carcinogenesis as well as could be potential markers of disease progression.",

In tissue of peritumoral area amounts of CD3+ and CD3+CD8+ cells were also higher, while CD19+ level was lower than in blood. In the same samples content of CD3+CD4+ was lower and amount of NK-cells was higher than in tumor tissue. Triple- negative subtype was characterized by maximal content of CD3+ lymphocytes (92.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4%), luminal A contained the highest amount of CD3+CD16/56+ cells (10.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.73%) vs luminal B (4.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.27%) and triple-negative (4.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.63%). Her2+ neu BC demonstrated high amount of NK-cells in peritumoral area but not in tumor.p53 overexpression was equally often recorded in luminal B and Her2+ subtypes of BC and slightly less frequently in triple-negative subtype. Accumulation of p53 was 2 times less frequently detected in luminal A subtype in comparison with triple -negative cancer and 2.5 and 2.7 times less frequently in comparison with luminal B and Her2+ BC, respectively. Study of bcl-2 expression showed reducing the frequency of positive tumor cell staining in dependence on the receptor status of tumor: positive cases were several times less frequent in triple-negative and Her2+ subtypes in comparison with luminal A and B subtypes.Luminal A subtype was characterized by the minimal p53, topoisomerase 2 \u03b1 and androgen receptor expression and maximal expression of bcl-2 and E-cadherin. Luminal B subtype showed a high expression of p53, bcl-2 and androgen receptors and moderate expression of topoisomerase 2 \u03b1 and E-cadherin. High expression of topoisomerase 2 \u03b1 , low expression of androgen receptors and moderate expression of E- cadherin were registered in triple-negative BC. The maximal expression of topoisomerase 2 \u03b1 and p53, as well as low expression of bcl-2 and E-cadherin, was observed in Her2+ subtype.CD8+ T-lymphocytes dominate in tumor tissue of BC. Besides, tumor tissue of luminal A BC contains more NK-cells than other subtypes. A number of differences in expression of apoptosis-controlling proteins was observed in various molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Luminal A BC was noted for the minimal p53 expression and maximal bcl-2expression. Luminal B subtype had a high p53 and bcl- 2 expression. In Her2+ BC p53 expression was maximal and bcl-2 expression was low. The described differences allow assessing molecular subtypes of breast cancer and predicting the disease course from previously unexplored perspectives.",

Change of its qualitative and quantitative composition is regarded as an edge with pathology of the condition with extremely diverse effects: from decreasing the quality of life to enhancing the carcinogenic risks induced by anaerobic bacteria metabolites (Mavzyutov et al., 2007). It was shown that vaginal microbiota changes typical for bacterial vaginosis (BV) are accompanied by similar changes in the CC microbiota (Smith et al., 2014) that is associated with an increased risk of HIV, herpes virus type 2, HPV, and neoplasia contamination (Borgdorff et al., 2014).To identify the bacteria types that influence the most significant changes in cytological patterns of the CC in women with BV.To identify cytological characteristics of the inflammatory process in the CC associated with BV and quantitative species-specific changes in cervical microbiota, cervical scrapings of 122 women (aged 18\u201345) were studied with LC (Krjukova, 2008) and real-time PCR (\u201cFemoflor 16\u201d, Russia).Following the cytological characteristics of the cellular composition (abs.), presence of columnar epithelium, state of cell nuclei, nuclear size, chromatin state, number of nuclei in the cell (abs.Val.), existence and nature of nuclear changes, changes of the cell shape, vacuolization of cytoplasm, cytoplasm clearing, cell cytolysis, signs of keratinization, changes of cell size, increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio and other factors, the women were divided into 2 groups. The first group consisted of women with cervicitis without vaginosis, and the other group- with cervicitis associated with BV. Quantitative molecular genetic studies have shown that in the cervicitis associated with BV, significantly higher values were characterized by total bacterial mass and the scraping content of Gardnerella vaginalis/Prevotella bivia/Porphyromonas spp., Sneathia spp./Leptotrihia spp./Fusobacterium spp., Megasphaera spp./Veillonella spp./Dialister spp., Mobiluncus spp./Corynebacterium spp., Lachnobacterium spp./Clostridium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Atopobium vaginae and Ureaplasma spp. However, the concentration of Enterobacteriaceae and Mycoplasma hominis in cervicitis not accompanied and not associated with BV was not significantly different. According to LC, in cervicitis associated with BV, the test material contained statistically significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) large quantities of surface epithelial cells, leukocytes, macrophages, \u201ckey\u201d cells and small rod-shaped bacteria, but cytolysis and ectomorphy bacteria were not found. According to factor analysis of quantitative PCR and LC, the most significant was positive relationship between increasing concentration of Lachnobacterium spp./Clostridium spp., Mobiluncus spp./Corynebacterium spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., A. vaginae Mycoplasma hominis and detection of small rod-shaped bacterial flora and the \u201ckey\u201d cells; and negative \u2013 with the identification of accommodation bacteria. The increase of Ureaplasma spp. in the cervical scraping in connection with BV was accompanied by increase of cells without increase of macrophages. The combined increase of leukocytes and macrophages was accompanied by a significant reduction of surface epithelium cells.1. Cytological pattern of inflammation during BV differs from the pattern of cervical inflammation not associated with BV; 2. Quantitative changes of the CC microbiota in BV detected by PCR are correlated with the cytological features of the inflammation pattern; 3. The influence of inflammation caused by quantitative changes in the CC microbiota on the increased risk of neoplastic processes is not excluded.",

However, not all biological mechanisms and the effects of these endopeptidases are well-established. Previously it was believed that MMP functions only as proteolytic enzymes, but it was found later that MMPs could act as regulators of protein kinase signal transduction pathways by modifying receptors and signaling molecules.One of the most important substrates for MMP is transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF- \u03b2 ) , which is a receptor for the ligand TGF-\u03b2-signal transduction pathway comprises a network of protein kinase pathways responsible for many of the processes of tumor progression, including epithelial mesenchymal transformation (EMT). Despite the fact that melanoma cells are not of epithelial origin, they express the epithelial E-cadherin that is necessary for their interaction with the basal layers of the epidermis. The degradation of the extracellular matrix and loss of expression of E-cadherin are major changes needed to start the processes of melanoma invasion. One of the markers of EMT is a transcription factor twist1. Twist1 activates the processes of epithelial-mesenchymal transformation and increases the invasion of melanoma cells by increasing transcription of MMP. The aim of this study was to evaluate expression levels TGF-\u03b2, twist1 under selective inhibition of MMP-9 and combined inhibition of MMP-9 and-13 in melanoma model in vivo; to determine the role of MMPs as possible regulators of TGF-\u03b2-way signal transduction, as well as associated with TGF-\u03b2 EMT process.The study was approved by the local Ethic Committee (protocol No. 144/ 2012 of 15.11.2012). Melanoma B16-bearing mice (control group consisted of 7 animals, MMP-9 inhibitor treatment group \u2013 7, MMP-9/13 inhibitor treatment group \u2013 7 animals) underwent experimental treatment by MMP inhibitor (Calbiochem, USA) by daily application within 7\u00a0days. Control group consisted of animals without treatment. Efficacy of MMP-9 inhibition was evaluated by gelatinize zymography. TGF-\u03b21 and twist 1 transcription factor expression was determined by PCR real-time using StepOne System (Applied Biosystems, USA). Statistical analysis was done by Kruskal\u2013Wallis test and Multiple Comparisons. The P values lower 0.05 were considered as significant.It was found that the selective inhibition of MMP-9 did not induce changes in expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 and twist1, however, the combined inhibition of MMP-9 and MMP-13 significantly reduced the expression levels of the transcription factor twist1 and TGF-\u03b2. The results show that MMP-9 and MMP-13 act as activators of TGF-\u03b2-signal transduction pathway and could be considered as potential molecular targets for experimental therapy for cancer.",

     "abstract": "In 2004, COP1 was characterized as p53 E3-specific human ubiquitin ligase according to in vitro studies. Later, oncogenic activity of COP1 and correlation of its overexpression with level of p53 protein in clinical tumor samples and cell lines were shown. High expression level of COP1 was described in 25 of 32 cases of breast carcinomas and in 76 out of 171 cases of ovarian carcinomas. High expression level of COP1 was described in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines (PLC, Hep3B and HepG2, Huh7). In 40 of 55 cases of pancreatic cancer, overexpression of COP1 was also noted. Some types of leukemia, melanoma, breast, lung and prostate cancer contain focal deletions of COP1. COP1 overexpression was also found in non- oncological diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy, ischemic cardiomyopathy and juvenile dermatomyositis.Similar to other p53-related E3 -ubiquitin ligases COP1 has different substrates. The selection of target for ubiquitination depends on cell type or differentiation stage. Among the substrates of COP1, besides p53 are: c-Jun, ETV1, ACC, TORC2, FOXO1 and C/EBP\u03b1, FIP200.To identify novel proteins that interact with COP1 we applied proteomics. Proteins co-immunoprecipitated with COP1 were analyzed by MALDI -TOF mass spectrometry. To achieve this, COP1\u20133xFlag expression vector was generated and transfected into HEK 293T cells by calcium phosphate transfection method. Protein complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG beads. Bound proteins were then separated by 1D SDS\u2013PAGE gel electrophoresis and analyzed by means of ESI-LC/MS/MS mass spectrometry. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis of the interacting proteins was employed. About 25% of identified proteins were attributed to the cytoskeleton proteins, almost 20% of proteins had known role in metabolism. According to the literature data, it was not surprising to find several proteins involved in the lipid metabolism. Finally, a significant groups of interactants play role in transcription, cell adhesion, apoptosis, protein modification and transport. It is important to note that several COP1-bound proteins can be strong regulators of cell cycle in G2/M transition. Our data can be used for the subsequent studies of previously unknown roles of COP1 in different diseases.This work was funded by Grants fromRussian Scientific Foundation\u2013 Russia (No.114-15-00816) and Grant of Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Sciences.",

     "abstract": "KRAS is component of Ras/MAPK signaling cascade that regulates cell proliferation and cell survival. Somatic mutations in KRAS gene are often found in tumors and affect the sensitivity of tumors to target therapy. Mutations in codons 12 or 13 of KRAS gene in colorectal cancer (CRC) are associated with resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies Cetuximab and Panitumumab. The objectives of this work were to develop PCR tests for detection mutations in KRAS gene and analyze the frequency of mutations in KRAS gene in CRC in Russia.DNA sequencing by Sanger is the most common method for mutation analysis. However, the method has a sensitivity of 20% mutant allele, which is often not sufficient for the analysis of somatic mutations in tumors.One of the most sensitive mutation analysis methods is allele-specific real-time PCR. This method allows to detect 1% of mutated DNA in the sample. This sensitivity is sufficient for analysis of mutations in tumor samples containing 2\u20135% or more of tumor cells in normal tissue.In this study we developed and compared 3 new KRAS assays (1) real-time PCR with allele-specific primers; (2) real-time wild-type blocking PCR with LNA (locked nucleic acid) blocker; and (3) Sanger sequencing with LNA-blocker. First assay is a PCR test with seven reactions using allele-specific primers for detection and genotyping 7 mutations in 12 and 13 codons of KRAS gene. Second assay is real-time PCR with only a single pair of primers and LNA oligonucleotide blocker. LNA-blocker is an oligonucleotide which has a wild-type sequence of codons 12 and 13 of KRAS gene. LNA-blocker binds strongly to wild-type KRAS DNA and suppresses its amplification, but does not block amplification of mutant DNA. The real-time PCR with LNA -blocker can detect mutant DNA but does not genotype mutation. Such assay can be used as a simple and sensitive screening test for mutant KRAS cases if exact genotyping of mutation is not required. We also used LNA-blocker to increase sensitivity of Sanger sequencing. To evaluate sensitivity and specificity of new tests DNA standards were prepared with different ratios of normal and mutant alleles using normal human DNA without mutation and recombinant plasmids with mutations in KRAS (G12C, G12S, G12R, G12V, G12D, G12A, G13D). After optimization all three assays had sensitivity 5% of mutant alleles for the detection of mutations in KRAS gene, using 2.5\u201340\u00a0ng of human DNA.Performance of new assays for KRAS mutations was compared using 81 colorectal tumor samples. Before analysis relative content of tumor cells in the samples was evaluated by pathologist. If tumor content was less than 20% in the sample then regions with a maximum number of tumor cells were manually macrodissected before the DNA extraction. DNA was purified from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue using \u201cFFPE-DNA Kit\u201d (Biolink). All three assays had high sensitivity (95\u2013100%) and specificity (100%) for detection of KRAS mutations in clinical tumor samples. Mutations of the KRAS gene were found in 37 of 81 cases (46%) of CRC including 12 cases of mutation G13D, 11 cases of G12D, 5 cases of mutation G12V, 4 cases G12C, 3 cases of mutation G12A, 2 cases G12S, 1 case G13R. A single case with mutation G13R was missed by allele-specific PCR but was detected by real-time PCR with LNA-blocker and confirmed by sequencing.New assays have high sensitivity and specificity and are suitable for detection of KRAS mutations in clinical FFPE tumor samples.",

     "abstract": "The analysis of circulating tumor nucleic acids (DNAs and RNAs) in the blood seems to be a promising approach for the development of the low-invasive methods of tumor detection, valuable for clinical practice. Detection of oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs in the blood plasma/serum is evidence of their participation in pathogenesis and suggest the possibility of their use as tumor markers and targets for therapy. Thus, the determination of expression level of tumor-associated miRNAs in plasma can lead to significant progress in understanding the tumor development and treatment.Estimation the changes in expression level of miRNAs (miR-19b, miR-25, miR-125b, miR-126, miR-205) in blood plasma from lung cancer patients during combined therapy and to estimate their value as disease monitoring markers.Blood samples were taken from patients (n\u00a0=\u00a023) with non-small cell lung cancer treated at the Tomsk Cancer Research Institute. These samples were stabilized and fractionated into plasma and blood cells. MicroRNA was isolated from blood plasma using single-phase phenol-free extraction protocol and purified on silica-based spin columns (BioSilica Ltd, Novosibirsk, Russia). Concentration of five above mentioned miRNAs was measured by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to miR-16 using dCt method.In this study we analyzed the dynamic expression changes of circulating DNA in blood plasma from lung cancer patients during the combined therapy. Circulating miRNAs were isolated from plasma samples of non-small cell lung cancer patients before treatment, within 30\u00a0days after completing chemotherapy and 15\u00a0days after surgery, by using developed methodological approach. In case of miR-19b and miR-125b analysis was found that the miRNA expression level correlates with clinical response to chemotherapy and surgery. Increasing level of miR-19b and decreasing level of miR-125b were associated with therapeutic response. Using Repeated measures ANOVA analysis we demonstrated that the miR-19b and miR-125b expression levels changes throughout three check-up points during the combined treatment are characterized by the significant cubic trend (P\u00a0=\u00a00.00284 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.029, respectively). Changes of miRNA-126 expression level during post-treatment follow-up were not characterized by the definite trend and not correlated with changes of other miRNAs expression level. It was shown the significant correlation between miRNA-25 and miRNA-205 expression levels, but was not found the trend of these miRNAs level changes.The clinical utility of the circulating miR-19b and miR-125b expression analysis from this study remains to be validated in large cohorts of patients with different histological types of tumors, at the different stage of disease and outcomes. One of the criteria for inclusion in the group must be susceptibility and/or resistance to therapy.The research has been carried out with support of the grant from theRussian Science Support Foundation14-04-01881, Post-doctorate program in TPU.",

We have previously shown that ovarian cancer cells secrete a range of factors with possible roles in metastatic angiogenesis including the lysosomal proteases cathepsin D (CD) and cathepsin L (CL). However, the role of these proteases in ovarian cancer metastasis to the omentum is not fully understood.To investigate whether proliferative effects of CD and CL are dependent on their catalytic activity in HOMECs.To investigate the intracellular signalling kinases activated by CD and CL.HOMEC proliferation was assessed by using a colorimetric (WST1) assay. Potential signalling pathways were examined by phosphokinase array and ELISAs. pH experiments were carried out examine whether the observed effects were due to the catalytic activity of CD and CL.CD and CL (50\u00a0ng/ml) significantly increased HOMEC proliferation to 141\u00a0\u00b1\u00a027% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, n\u00a0=\u00a050) and 151%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, n\u00a0=\u00a045) respectively vs. control (100%) 72\u00a0h post-treatment.

     "abstract": "RCC is one of the main problems in oncourology. MiRNA expression profiles are highly specific for malignant tumors of different locations, and can be used to detect pathological molecular biomarkers and to develop the optimal treatment for each patient. Selection of miRNAs associated with the formation and development of malignant tumors in the kidney was performed using computer databases miRWalk (http://www.ma.uni-hei-delberg.de/apps/zmf/mirwalk/) and miRBase (http://www.mir-base.org/). Paired samples of tumor and histologically normal tissue from 46 patients with RCC were studied. RNA was isolated by phenol\u2013chloroform extraction and treated with RNase-free DNase after isolation. MiRNA expression analysis was performed by RT-qPCR using Applied Biosystems (USA) kits: TaqMan\u00ae MicroRNA Assays, TaqMan\u00ae MicroRNA Reverse Transcription Kit, TaqMan\u00ae Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (2x). RNU6B was used as reference miRNA. Quantity alterations of 20 microRNAs (hsa-miR-219, -203, -148a, -129, -9, -34a, -34b, -34c-3p, -127, -193a-5p, -191, -17, -24 -2*, -339 -3p, -212, -375, -125b, -124a, -132, -137) were determined in samples of tumor compared to normal tissue biopsy from the kidney of each patient. It was shown that the expression of studied miRNAs usually decreased in RCC tumors. The largest decrease of expression was observed for miR-129, which expression was10\u2013350-fold reduced in 93% of the samples (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) with no change of expression in the remaining 7% of cases. MiR-375 (80% of cases,10\u2013270-fold decrease), miR-34b (79% of cases, 10\u201360-fold decrease), miR-124a (70% of cases, 10\u2013200-fold decrease) also frequently showed reduced expression in tumors. In addition to the aforementioned ones, it had been shown that expression in the tumor compared with histologically normal tissue from the same patient was significantly decreased in more than half of the cases for miR-125b, miR-127, miR-203, miR-34c-3p, miR-9. Despite the fact that in 50% of cases decreased expression of miR-9 was detected, it was the only of studied microRNA with a significant increase in the expression in 21% of cases in 10\u2013160 times (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Associations between the expression of investigated miRNAs and gender and age were not noted. Dealing with each miRNA alone, we could not detect the dependence of expression alteration of 20 selected miRNAs from the stage or degree of tumor differentiation of the studied RCC samples. However, the analysis of the expression profile of 20 miRNAs in complex showed that decreased expression was observed much less frequently in the samples with a later RCC stage than in samples with early RCC stage. For example, in a tumor sample of a patient with stage IV (T3aN2M1) expression was reduced only for miR-129 and miR-375 in 10 times for each miRNA, while the expression of miR-9 was increased. In samples with stage III expression was reduced in 2 or 4 out of the selected 20 miRNAs, in samples with stage I expression decrease was observed for 9 out of 20 studied miRNAs. Since kidney tissue from the same patient was taken as the control, it could be assumed that the absence of expression decrease in studied 20 miRNAs in tumors was due to a decrease in their expression in the surrounding tissues, which eliminated the difference in the quantity of miRNAs in tumors and surrounding tissues. An additional experiment, in which kidney tissue from healthy donors with no history of cancer was taken as a control, showed decreased expression of miR-125b, miR-124a, miR-127, miR-203, miR-34c- 3p, miR-9, miR-129, miR- 34b in histologically normal tissue of patients with RCC. There was identified a group of miRNAs out of studied 20 ones which may be involved in the progression of RCC, they were at least miR-129, miR-375 and miR-9. Expression characteristics of miRNAs require further study and may be used as biomarkers.",

     "abstract": "Heparansulfate (HS) is a glycosaminoglycan present on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix, which interacts with diverse signal molecules and is essential for many physiological processes including embryonic development, cell growth, inflammation, and blood coagulation. d-glucuronyl C5-epimerase (GLCE) is a crucial enzyme in HS synthesis, converting d-glucuronic acid (GlcA) to l-iduronic acid (IdoA) to increase HS flexibility. Aberrant modification may result in wrong structure of polysaccharide chains of HS and defects of microenvironment associated with malignant transformation.We previously experimentally identified the GLCE polymorphism Ile597Val. Its localization close to the activity center of the enzyme and different physical parameters of the involved amino acids suggest that the polymorphism is functional. So, three different variants of GLCE dimers with different enzymatic activity may exist in heterozygous carriers. Bioinformatics\u2019 search (PubMed resource) revealed interracial variations in allele frequency distribution. Unusual high frequency of allele G was shown for black race (45%) compared with white race (17%). Taking into account the increased resistance of negroid race to breast cancer, we assume a potential involvement of the GLCE polymorphism in breast cancer.The estimation of effects of GLCE functional polymorphism A2017G (Ile597Val) on the gene expression levels in normal and breast cancer cells and LOH in breast tumors.Breast cancer patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0144.) had histologically verified diagnoses. Blood and breast cancer tissue samples as well as matched control tissues were collected from each patient during surgery. Genomic DNA was isolated by phenol extraction. Total RNA was isolated by TRIZol, RNA quantity was accessed by Qubit instrument with appropriate reagents and cDNA was obtained using First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit. SNP A2017G (rs3865014) was analyzed by Custom Real-Time SNP Array and GLCE expression levels were determined using Taq-Man-based Real-Time PCR (Applied Biosystems). Statistical analysis was carried out using a Statistika 9.0 software.AA genotype carriers had a 2-fold increase in GLCE mRNA levels in tumors compared with control surrounding tissues (0.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77 versus 0.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Oppositely, AG genotype carriers had a 1.5-fold decrease in GLCE mRNA levels in tumors compared with control surrounding tissues (0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29 versus 0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 ). However, in any case,the GLCE expression in both normal tissues and breast tumors was more active in AG genotype carriers than in AA carriers. It is known that LOH is often associated with molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis, we studied this process for the same patients. According our results, LOH was detected in about 10% of cases (5/52 patients), among which G was lost in 3 patients and A was lost in 2 patients.The obtained data show a possible association between GLCE Ile597Val polymorphism and breast cancer, although the nature of the association remains ambiguous.",

     "abstract": "Malignant gliomas are fast-growing, heterogeneous and invasive brain tumors strongly infiltrated by non-tumor cells. Glioma attracts variety of immune cells, in particular microglia/macrophages and re-program these cells into immunosuppressive, tumor-supporting cells. Factors responsible for pro-invasive macrophage polarization and shaping tumor microenvironment in tumor-supporting manner are poorly known. We analyzed glioma secretome using proteomical approach and identified lactadherin (Mfge8) and osteopontin (Spp1) in microglia-activating fractions. Both osteopontin and lactadherin are \u03b1v\u03b23/\u03b1v\u03b25 integrin ligands able to interact with receptors present on microglia and macrophages and thus could be involved in pro-invasive polarization of microglia/macrophages. Moreover, both Spp1 and Mfge8 are overexpressed in glioma cells, but not in non-transformed astrocytes. C6 glioma cells stably expressing shRNA specific to lactadherin (shMfge8), osteopontin (shSpp1) and negative shRNA (shNeg) were implanted into striatum of Wistar rats. There was no difference in proliferation and viability of C6 glioma cells, cells stably expressing shRNA specific to lactadherin, ostopontin and negative shRNA in vitro, that demonstrates the negligible effect of autocrine production of both protein on tumor cell growth. Knockdown of Spp1 and Mfge8 resulted in significant reduction of tumor volume in rat model of glioma. Immunochemical analysis of brain sections revealed similar numbers of infiltrating microglia/macrophages (Iba1 staining), but the reduced number of ameboid, arginase 1 expressing cells in Mfge8 \u2013 depleted tumor. Treatment of endothelial cells with rhMFGE8 revealed significant effect of that protein on angiogenesis in vitro, however lactadherin-depleted tumors do not exhibit reduced blood vessel density in rat glioma model. FACS analysis showed that silencing of Spp1 does not affect total number of CD11b-positive cells, but strongly modulates microenvironment by leading to significant changes in percentage of Tc and Treg cells infiltrating tumor-bearing hemisphere. Our results suggest that glioma-derived integrin ligands are important factor in polarization of glioma infiltrating microglia/macrophages into the pro-invasive phenotype and its targeting could be a new therapeutic strategy.",

     "abstract": "It\u2019s well documented that cytokines in patients with breast cancer are indicators of survival, assessing the risk of recurrence and mortality. However, the obtained data about serum levels of cytokines are contradictory. The problem of participation of cytokines in the growth and spread of tumors requires further study.The purpose was the determination of serum level of cytokine in experimental model of breast cancer in Wistar rat. Material and methods: Breast cancer was induced by intramammalirian injection of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea. Some of the rats were subjected to only surgery or only polychemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil).Serum levels of cytokines: Bio-Plex Pro Rat Cytokines 24-Plex Assay (Bio-Rad, USA) were used.It was found that the serum levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, IFN -\u03b3, MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-3\u03b1, RANTES, TNF-\u03b1 in rats with experimental breast cancer were significantly higher compared with intact rats. We obtained that pro-inflammatory cytokines are associated with progression of breast cancer in rats. The serum levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-18, G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO/KC, IFN-\u03b3, MIP-1\u03b1, RANTES in rats after surgical treatment were significantly higher compared to those in rats without surgical treatment. It was also observed that in rats after surgical treatment,the serum levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-12, IL-18, G-CSF, GM-CSF, GRO/KC, IFN-\u03b3, MIP-1\u03b1, RANTES were decreased. We suppose that these data may indicate that tumor cells can also produce cytokines. Moreover, we obtained that in intact rats, serum levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-18, EPO, G-CSF, GRO/KC, MIP-1\u03b1 were higher compared to those in rats with breast cancer treated with surgery. However, the serum levels of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 (markers of pro- inflammation and tumor metastasis) were higher in surgically treated rats compared to those in intact rats. It has been proved that the removal of primary tumors (without regional lymph node removal and subsequent polychemotherapy) can lead to accelerated growth of metastases. It was found that the polychemotherapy resulted in a significant decrease in the serum levels of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-18. Polychemotherapy also leads to suppression in serum levels RANTES, VEGF, MCP-1. We found that the serum levels of IL-2, IL-5, IL-7, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-18, G-CSF were significantly higher in rats after combination of surgery and polychemotherapy.The serum level of cytokines in rats with experimental breast cancer depends on the type of treatment.",

     "abstract": "Colon adenocarcinoma is one of the most wide spreading malignant tumors in the world, mortality of which remains high. Estimation of cancer on late stages, absence of prognostic and predictive factors, poor understanding of progression mechanism may lead to elevation of mortality.The aim of investigation was to identify morphologic prognostic factors and their combination for colon adenocarcinoma.For this purpose 776 patients with colon adenocarcinoma with the median age 57.6 years were selected. Receptors for chemokine (CCR10, CXCR4), stem cell marker (ALDH1), ki-67, MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, PMS2 were investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results of IHC were compared with clinical data. Analysis of 217 colon adenocarcinomas by Ki-67 showed that 86% of cases had high proliferative level (Ki-67>30%), among them 39% of cases had very high level of Ki-67 (>70%). We also analyzed proliferation of stem cells using double IHC stain for ALDH1 and Ki-67. It was shown that ALDH1 positive cells had significantly lower Ki-67 positivity than ALDH1 negative cells (p<0,001). ALDH1 positive cells never have proliferative level more than 10%.Nowadays development of metastases often relates to interaction between chemokines and their receptors. In our study we analyze two receptors: CCR10 and CXCR4 as most known in literature data.Investigation of CCR10 and CXCR4 shows, that 77% of colon cancers have expression of CXCR4 and no one \u2013 CCR10. It was found that low level of proliferation (Ki-67<30%) and expression of CXCR4 were more often revealed in disseminated cancer (IV stage) than in localized (II stage), p=0.002. The 5-year relapse- free survival rate in patients with Ki- 67>70% and CXCR4<30% was 75% and 25%, respectively, with median survival time of 16.5 months. Vice versa cases with CXCR4>70% and Ki-67<30% hadthe 5- year relapse-free survival rates of 32% and in 68%, respectively, with the median survival time of 7 month. IHC study of MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MLH1 shows that at least lack of one marker always accompanies by microsatellite instability. Mutations of these markers were accompanied by lack of expression in 100% of cases. Thus, according to modern classification of colon cancer grade, we divided 45 cases into low and high grades using only histological criteria and additionally \u2013 IHC investigation of MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MLH1. It was shown that in 9% of cases IHC of these markers prevent incorrect evaluation of cancer grade. Conclusion: immunohistochemical investigation of CXCR4, Ki-67, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MLH1 may be additional useful prognostic factors for patients with colon adenocarcinoma.",

     "abstract": "Melanoma is defined as heterogeneous and complex neoplastic system. Melanoma tumor microenvironment composes of different cell types including tumor-associated lymphocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, etc. These cells may intensify tumor growth and progression by releasing various active substances.MicroRNAs are a class of posttranscriptional regulators, which play an essential role in proliferation, adhesion, motility and migration of cancer cells. Several studies showed that microRNAs produced by tumor microenvironment cells could act as paracrine modulators for modification of cancer cells biological behavior. For identification of melanoma microenvironment microRNA profile we performed microarray analysis of melanoma samples (n\u00a0=\u00a010) obtained from Krasnoyarsk Territory Oncological Center and macrodissected to separate tumor complexes and tumor microenvironment.RNA was extracted from tissue samples by MirVana kit (Ambion, Life Technologies, Canada) in accordance to manufacturer recommendations. The microRNA concentration was measured by Qubit\u00ae 2.0 Fluorimeter (Life technologies Holdings Pte Ltd., USA). miRNA expression profiles were processed by the Affimetrix microarray system (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Expression changes between melanoma and nevi samples were identified using P-value of 0,05. 2.0-fold difference in either direction was a minimal fold change expression required. A hierarchical clustering analysis for differentially expressed miRNAs was carried out by Transcriptome Analysis Console 2.0.24 microRNAs were identified with altered expression levels in melanoma cells as compared to tumor microenvironment cells including hsa-miR-106a-5p, hsa-miR-3178, hsa-miR-223-3p, hsa-miR-17-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-4745-5p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-363-3p, hsa-miR-4739, hsa-miR-514b-5p, hsa-miR-3175, hsa-miR-6805-5p, hsa-miR-6769b-5p. Of 24 miRNAs, 3 were upregulated in melanoma microenvironment as compared to melanoma cells, whereas 21 were downregulated. Among these microRNA, miR-106a-5p was the most downregulated in microenvironment, while miR-4433b-5p was found to be the most upregulated. Of the 24 differentially expressed miRNAs in the tumor microenvironment, DIANA-miR-path identified 9 miRNAs with predicted gene targets. MiR-106a-5p as the most upregulated in melanoma tissue was identified to be involved in MAPK, TGF-beta signaling pathways regulation. Besides, miR-106a-5p participates in actin cytoskeleton regulation, adherens junction and focal adhesion that may correspond to increased motility of melanoma cells.MicroRNA profiling may serve as useful tool for preliminary microRNA search with following their target genes identification for investigation of epigenetic regulation mechanisms in cancer.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastomas (GBL) are most aggressive brain tumors in adults. They are often radio- and chemotherapy resistant. The standard therapy of GBL includes surgery followed by radiotherapy with concomitant chemotherapy with temozolomide named temodal (imidazotetrazine derivative). Methylation of the O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter is considered as predictor of better outcome of temodal therapy in comparison with the cases without MGMT promoter methylation (Stupp et al., 2009). The aim of this study is finding of additional predictors of temozolomide therapy effectiveness.We obtained primary cultures of GBL. The rate of GBL sensitivity to temozolomide was revealed by MTT test. Expression of multidrug resistance genes and genes which mediate temozolomide sensitivity (YB1, MDR1, MRP1, LRP, BCRP and MGMT) was determined by real time PCR. Protein localization and expression was revealed by immunohistochemical technique.We developed 14 primary GBL cultures. Staining for nestin was used for demonstration of neuronal origin of cell cultures. Analysis of gene expression and the rate of cell proliferation of the cultures showed that the rate of YB1 gene expression in slow proliferating cultures is significantly lower than in quickly proliferating cell populations. Cell cultures differed in temodal sensitivity 2\u20132.5-fold. We analyzed whether GBL cell sensitivity to temodal and the rate of several genes\u2019 expression are correlated. We did not find the correlation between cell temodal sensitivity and the rate of MGMT gene expression. These data are in accordance with some results of another authors (Mullins et al., 2013; Brennan et al., 2013). However, we revealed positive correlation of the temodal sensitivity of GBL cultures and MVP/LRP expression (r\u00a0=\u00a00.5592, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). We found also the trend to negative correlation between GBL temodal sensitivity and YB1 gene expression (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.43602, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) as well as MDR1 expression (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.4195, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).The rate of temodal sensitivity of GBL primary cultures is connected with the rate of the expression of MVP/LRP, YB1 and MDR1genes. It is likely that YB-1 protein affects temodal sensitivity by influence on DNA reparation. YB1 could also have an effect on MDR1 expression. MVP/LRP expression is independent factor of GBL prognosis.This paper was completed with partial support from theRussian Foundation for Basic Research\u2013 Russia (Grant No.23-04-40204).",

     "abstract": "Malignant tumors consist not only of neoplastic cells, but also of various normal cells, for example fibroblasts, macrophages or endothelial cells. These normal cells stand under constant pressure of transformed cells, regulating their properties and converting them into tumor-promoting cells. Tumor-stroma interaction takes place during all stages of carcinogenesis. Notch activation upon receptor binding with the ligand is a way of direct intercellular communication during embryo- and histogenesis, determining various processes like differentiation, proliferation, etc. It has been previously shown that in tumors this signaling cascade regulates not only properties of transformed cells, but also stromal cells activities, i.e. neoangiogenesis. The Notch role in communication between neoplastic cells and stromal fibroblasts is underinvestigated.Cancer-associated stromal fibroblasts (CAFs) are an important component of tumors secreting growth factors and proteases, modulating immune reactions and contributing to cancer stem cells niches formation. CAFs resemble myofibroblasts and express \u03b1 Smooth-Muscle Actin ( \u03b1 SMA).We obtained and characterized cultures of normal mesenchymal cells: a myofibroblasts-like (MF), and fibroblasts-like MC1 and MC2, differing by Notch1 expression. These cell cultures variously influenced growth of colon cancer notch- ligand Jagged2-positive HCT116 xenographs in nude mice. MF cells were characterized by the strongest while Notch1-deficient MC2 by the weakest tumor-promoting activity.MC1 but not MC2 started to express \u03b1 SMA upon co-cultivation in vitro with neoplastic HCT116 cells. Such co-cultivation also lead to Notch activation according to a luciferase reporter. NICD (Notch Intracellular Domain) expression activated MC1 and MC2, while Notch1 silencing in MC1 abrogated both HCT116-mediated activation of the fibroblasts in vitro and their tumor-promoting activity in vivo.Notch signaling in mesenchymal cells stimulated TGFb production that lead to both autocrine and paracrine receptors stimulation. We believe that this cytokine activates fibroblasts in our experimental system. We also revealed that this process was p53-dependent.So we have shown Notch1 to be involved in tumor-stroma interaction, particularly its activation leading to fibroblasts transdifferentiation. Notch1-stimulated fibroblasts are able to produce TGFb and to promote tumor growth in xenographs. The tumor-stimulating potency of various fibroblasts in our experimental system depends on their ability to transdifferentiate to myofibroblasts upon Notch activation.",

     "abstract": "The efficiency of endocrine therapy for tumors is limited by the development of hormone resistance and progression of tumor cells to hormone-independent phenotype. Among these tumors \u2013 breast cancers, for which hormone therapy is one of the most common and effective methods of treatment, but only in cases, when the tumors retain their hormonal dependence. The mechanism of hormonal independence was found to be based on the fundamental properties of cancer cell including both downregulation of specific hormone receptors, and affecting of intracellular signalling, particularly \u2013 estrogen-independent growth signaling pathways. However, the role of the intercellular interactions in the progression of hormonal resistance is still unclear.We hypothesize, that the formation of the clone of the hormone-resistant cells in the tumor, and the subsequent common growth of the hormone-resistant and sensitive cells may lead to spread the hormonal resistance to the sensitive cells \u2013 as a result of the secretion of the specific factors acting in the paracrine manner or via the direct cell\u2013cell contacts. Here, using the estrogen-dependent breast cancer cells MCF-7 and the resistant subline MCF-7/T developed by long-term cultivation of MCF-7 cells in the presence of antiestrogen tamoxifen, we investigated the possible changes in the hormonal sensitivity of these cells caused by the co-cultivation in vitro. For this purpose MCF-7/T cells were transfected with the plasmid containing the gene of the green fluorescent protein (GFP), and GFP-positive hormone-resistant subline MCF-7/T/GFP+ was developed. The GFP expression should allow to distinguish the resistant and parental cells during co-cultivation.To study the influence of the co-cultivation on the cell sensitivity to tamoxifen the parent MCF-7 cells (GFP-negative) were co-cultivate with the resistant MCF-7/T/GFP+/cells for 10\u00a0days, then the cells were treated with tamoxifen and the efficiency of growth inhibitory tamoxifen action was determined. We found, that the co -cultivation of the parent and resistant cells lead to increase in the resistance of the parent cell to tamoxifen, indicating the important role of the contacts, direct or indirect, between hormone sensitive and resistant cells in the development of hormone resistance.In general, we evaluate the established results as the first evidence of the possible involvement of the cell\u2013cell underrelations in the realization of the hormonal response, and suppose that the next investigations will give a new insights in the molecular mechanisms of this effects and its role in the formation of the hormone-resistant phenotype of the tumors.",

     "abstract": "Orthopedic oncologic prostheses are essential in postoperative therapy and improvement of life quality of oncological patients. However, construction and composition of implants has to be improved for better biocompatibility and reduction of inflammatory responses. The materials based on polylactic acid (PLA) and hydroxyapatite (HA) have been suggested as promising solution for implant coating in order to improve reconstruction of bone defects, to reduce risk of inflammation and implant rejection.To obtain the bioresorbable composites using biocompatible poly-L-lactide (PLA) with HA and to evaluate its effect on bone remodeling rate.After dissolution of PLA\u2217 in chloroform the powder-like HA (d\u00a0=\u00a020\u201340\u00a0nm) was added under vigorous stirring (PLA: HA\u00a0=\u00a075:25). The PLA/HA suspension was sonicated (40\u00a0kHz) and precipitated in ethanol. Fine fibers (d\u00a0=\u00a00.1\u2013 0.5\u00a0\u03bcm, of more than 2\u00a0mm length) were formed. The PLA/HA composite fibers were air-dried; they consisted of HA nanoparticles homogeneously distributed in the PLA matrix. The composites ability to participate in bone remodeling was estimated by determination of the polymer matrix dissolution rate and by formation of the CPL on the surface of the composites.The degradation rate of the polymer matrix was calculated by measuring concentration of lactic acid (by HPLC method), being released from PLA macromolecules as the result of the hydrolysis in the physiologic solution (pH 7, \u03c9(NaCl)\u00a0=\u00a00.9%). The PLA degradation rate during the first 4 days of soaking of the substrates (d\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0mm, S\u00a0=\u00a0190\u00a0mm2, m\u00a0=\u00a00.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0g) in the solution is rather high (Clactic acid\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0wt%), while on day 5 it decreases and stays constant during the rest of the time. The HA content increase in the composite results in the enhanced hydrolysis of PLA, caused both by the partial acid-base interaction between PLA and HA, and due to presence of the phase boundaries. Interesting to note that pure PLA (without HA) is hardly hydrolyzed in the physiologic solution even on the 30-th day of the experiment. Formation of calcium phosphate layer (CPL) was done in the SBF media, simulating the mineral constituents of the blood plasma at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, over 28 days period. The total concentration of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions in the SBF-solution was determined by daily trilonometry in the ammonia buffer with eriochrome black T as indicator. This investigation clearly shows that the substrates both of HA and PLA/HA promote the CLP formation on their surfaces. On day 14 of the substrates soaking in the SBF solution the increment of Ca2+, Mg2+ ions adsorbed on the HA substrate rose to the value of m (Ca2+\u00a0+\u00a0Mg2+)/VSBF\u00a0=\u00a00.11\u00a0mg/l, while the same value on the composite PLA/HA substrate was 0.06\u00a0mg/l. Thus the rate of adsorption of Ca2+ ions on the surface of HA is higher than that on the surface of the PLA/HA substrates. It is the result of the high HA content in the material. Pure PLA does not promote adsorption of Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions from the SBF media. Thus the HA particles incorporated in the PLA matrix may cause fast the CLP formation improving the ossification in the bone reconstruction processes. Biocompatibility and anti-inflammatory activity of PLA, HA and PLA/HA composite was studied in a pilot experiment in the cell-mediated immune response of individual donors in vitro using CD14+ human monocytes. Insignificant pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion of the M1 type (TNF\u03b1) is observed in the presence of PLA, while HA and PLA/HA composites don\u2019t contribute to their release. The PLA promotes the release of M2 cytokine CCL18 on day 6 of macrophage culturing suggesting potential anti-inflammatory properties of the material.The composite PLA/HA supports active bone-like layer formation on its surface improving ossification in the bone reconstruction process. The pilot experiment suggested that PLA/HA does not cause inflammatory reactions, while PLA can potentially regulate the balance between M1/M2 reaction to suppress unnecessary inflammation.\u2217Mol. mass ca 60\u00a0kDa, prepared in the Laboratory of Catalytic Research of Tomsk State University.This Research is supported byTomsk State University Competitiveness Improvement Program.

     "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment plays an important role in the progression of cancer and may be regulated by proteolysis, including the proteasomes. The proteasomes modify the biologically important molecules involved in the pathogenesis and progression of a variety of malignancies, including breast cancer (BC). The aim of this study was to investigate the features of the subunit composition of proteasomes in the tumor and its microenvironment of breast cancer.The material for investigation was samples of tumor tissue of invasive ductal breast cancer. The study was conducted to estimate the distribution of the total pool of proteasome, proteasomes activator PA700, immune proteasome forms containing LMP7 and/or LMP2 subunit in tumor cells and stromal component using immunofluorescence. Furthermore, there was evaluated the distribution of the proteasome in the tumor. The expression of immune proteasomes and proteasomes activators in the cells was studied by immunofluorescence labeling of the cells by antibodies to immune proteasome subunits and cell markers. Fluorescence was analyzed by using a fluorescence microscope DM RXA2 (\u201cLeica\u201d, Germany) and confocal microscope TCS SP (\u201cLeica\u201d, Germany). The specificity of the primary antibodies was confirmed by check samples, at which the reaction was carried out only with the second antibody. No cross reaction between the first and second antibodies was tested by incubation of each primary antibodies with the opposing second antibodies. In addition, there was carried out labeling the cell nuclei by reagent Hoechst 33,342.It was found that the tumor cells comprise immune proteasomes, also PA700 and PA28\u03b1b activators. Activator PA28\u03b1b and immune proteasomes are localized in the cytoplasm of tumor cells, whereas \u03b11, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 subunits and PA700 activator detected in the cytoplasm and in the nuclei of tumor cells. Availability of \u03b11, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 subunits in the nuclei of tumor cells shows the expression of constitutive proteasome subunits. Stromal cells are characterized by a high ratio of the \u03b11, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 subunits to the immune LMP2 subunit as compared to cells of invasive ductal carcinoma. This means that the pool of proteasome in tumor cells of invasive ductal cancer is enriched by the immune proteasomes as compared to stromal cells. Thus, samples of invasive ductal breast cancer contain predominantly tumor cells enriched by immune proteasomes, activators PA700 and PA28\u03b1b. The presence of proteasomes in stromal component indicates that the tumor microenvironment also has active processes of proteolysis, with involving proteasome system. Probably the processes occurring in the stromal component contribute to the output of the proteasome into the extracellular space, which is confirmed by other researchers about the existence of circulating proteasome pools and their further participation in dissemination of cancer.This work was supported by theRussian Foundationfor Basic Research (Grant numbers13-04-00169).",

Hypoxanthine 2.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.428\u00a0micro\u00a0mol/g tissue (in comparison with 0.711\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.269\u00a0micro\u00a0mol/g tissue). Whereas, adenosine level in BC after metformin therapy was 0.226\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.148\u00a0micro\u00a0mol/g tissue (in comparison with 0.186\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.056\u00a0micro\u00a0mol/g tissue), that were not significantly different.Thus, we have found that metformin significantly increases the rate of catabolism of adenosine, and this in turn reduces the inhibitory effect on the tumor microenvironment cytotoxic cells. Therefore, our data for the first time provide novel evidence for a mechanism that the anticancer activities of metformin are due to adenosine metabolism regulation.",

It has been shown that HER2-targeted therapies have radically changed the outcome of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The aim of this study was to develop the technique for preparation of recombinant anti-HER2/neu antibody from plants and to provide with the basic characteristics of the HER2/neu oncoprotein.We have designed and synthesized viral vectors to transform Agrobacterium tumifaciens affinity, ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography were used to purify the antibody. The quality of the substance was confirmed by SDS\u2013PAGE and ELISA. The biological activity was tested by immunofluorescent analysis.Antibodies were purified by affinity and ion exchange chromatography from the Agrobacterium tumifaciens leaves extracts. Gel filtration chromatography was used for final purification of the protein. Immunocytochemical staining was performed to test the functional activity of the plant-made antibodies. Here we also show that plant-made antibodies bind to HER2/neu receptors on the surface of human SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells as effectively as the diagnostic antibody A0485 (DAKO, Denmark). Flow cytometry analysis was used for quantitative estimation of recombinant anti-HER2/neu antibodies: from 75.7% to 98.3% cells bound the plant-made antibodies. The same data were obtained with trastuzumab.Based on the data obtained, we conclude that plant-made antibodies inhibit HER2/neu+ breast cancer cell proliferation. Additional experiments are required to prove that trastuzumab and plant-made antibodies share full identity in their biological activity.",

     "abstract": "Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system. The most frequent genetic alteration in PTC is the BRAF V600E mutation, which affects the activation of several intracellular signaling pathways. As a result, changes in the expression levels of cell membrane integrin receptors and their ligands \u2013 extracellular matrix proteins \u2013 osteopontin (OPN) and thrombospondin -1 (TSP1) are observed. This process increases the metastatic potential of tumor cells. Thus, integrin receptors and their ligands are potential biomarkers of an aggressive PTC phenotype.The aim of our study was to compare the gene expression profile of integrins ITGA2, ITGA3, ITGAV, ITGA6, ITGA9, ITGB1, ITGB3 and their ligands OPNa, OPNb, and TSP1 in PTC with different BRAF V600E mutation status.Intraoperative thyroid tissue samples from 41 patients diagnosed with PTC (n\u00a0=\u00a026), diffuse nodular nontoxic goiter (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and follicular adenoma (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were analyzed to evaluate the expression levels of the investigated genes by real time RT-PCR. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to confirm the PCR results and to estimate the amount of protein products. For IHC, frozen and paraffin sections were used. The BRAF V600E mutation was determined using allele-specific amplification. Nonparametric criteria (Kruskal Wallis, Wilcoxon and Mann\u2013Whitney tests) were used to evaluate group differences. P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.The BRAF V600E mutation was observed in 12 PTC samples, which corresponds to 46% of PTC cases. An increase of gene expression level of ITGA3 (2.9-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), ITGAV (1.9-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.038), ITGB1 (1.7-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026), OPNb (2.5-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and TSP1 (3.2-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) was identified in the PTC tissues, and a high gene expression level of OPNb (5.9-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and TSP1 (12.1-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) was identified in the tissue samples of lymph node metastases compared to the conventionally normal tissue.In the samples with advanced cancer (T3, T4, TNM) the expression levels of ITGA3, ITGA6 and ITGA9 were higher compared to the T1 samples. MRNA levels of ITGA3 and ITGAV were significantly higher in the PTC BRAF V600E positive samples than in the BRAF V600E negative samples.Elevated levels of OPNa (11.4-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0112), OPNb (10.2-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0216) and TSP1 (33.5-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005) genes were observed in the follicular adenoma samples compared to the PTC tissues. For ITGA2 and ITGB3 there was a significant increase of expression in the PTC tissues compared to the benign thyroid tumors (8.9-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019 and 38.4-fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014, respectively).We also studied the distribution and localization of integrins ITGA2 and ITGB3 in the thyroid tissues by IHC. In normal thyroid tissues ITGA2 and ITGB3 were located mainly in the follicular membrane. In the PTC tissue samples another location of the integrins was registered: ITGA2 was located mainly in the papillary structures, whereas ITGB3 was seen both at the basal and apical surfaces of thyrocytes. Follicular adenoma was characterized by a uniform distribution of both ITGA2 and ITGB3.The observed changes in the expression levels of the studied genes indicate their potential role in tumor progression and a possible impact on their expression of the mutant product of the BRAF gene. Integrins and their ligands, OPN and TSP1, could be considered potential markers in determining the prognosis and treatment of PTC.",

     "abstract": "Preoperative differential diagnosis of benign thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer is an important issue of endocrinology. Preoperative identification of a tumor type allows a surgeon to determine an adequate surgical treatment and reduce complications. The cytological analysis of samples obtained by the fine-needle aspiration biopsy is limited in sensitivity and specificity and the core biopsy is not safe to be used in patients with thyroid nodes smaller than 2\u00a0cm. The most promising area in the preoperative diagnosis of malignant tumors is molecular biomarkers, which can be used to determine the surgical treatment and indications for the target therapy. BRAF V600E is the most frequent genetic alteration in thyroid cancer. It activates the MAP-kinase pathway which causes changes in expression levels of extracellular matrix proteins and some of their receptors. Changes in the expression of integrin receptors and their ligands, such as osteopontin and thrombospondin-1, contribute to tumor cell proliferation and migration. The C-Jun pathway is also very important in pathogenesis of thyroid cancer. Changes in its activity can affect the expression of GSTP enzyme which participates in hormone metabolism. Altered MiRNA expression has been observed in a variety of cancer states allowing their potential use as cancer biomarkers.The aim of this study was to evaluate integrins, angiogenic factors, GSTP and MiRNAs as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid cancer.112 samples of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and 120 samples of benign nodular neoplasms were analyzed. The expression levels of the studied genes were determined by RT-PCR. The results were confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. The BRAF V600E mutation was determined by allele-specific real-time PCR. The results showed that GSTP can be used for clinical settings as a cancer-specific marker for thyroid neoplasms with 83\u201388% sensitivity, 70\u201380% specificity and 76\u201384% diagnostic accuracy. Higher expression levels of integrins \u03b12, \u03b15, \u03b1v, \u03b19, \u03b21, \u03b23 and IL-8, angiogenin, and VEGF were observed in malignant tumors in comparison with the normal thyroid tissue (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 70% of all PTC cases. In the BRAF V600E positive PTC samples the levels of ITGA3 and ITGAV expression were higher than in the BRAF V600E negative ones (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The expression of miRNA 21, 221, 222, 155 was significantly increased in the cancer samples compared to the benign neoplasms. Thus, the studied molecular markers could be used for preoperative diagnosis of thyroid neoplasms and the treatment approach.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic acidosis is a feature of many extreme physiological and pathological conditions; it is characterized by mitochondria dysfunction, increased membrane permeability and changes in the conformation of the protein molecules in violation of their enzymatic properties. In acidosis, intracellular pH shifts to the acidic side, which gives antitumor effect to the cytostatic agent the tumor was resistant to. It is known that the peritumoral zone is a buffer between the tumor and healthy tissue, so abnormalities in the tumor microenvironment changing conditions in peritumoral area will likely affect the tumor status and its response to antitumor therapy. The degree of tissue metabolic acidosis in affected area can be increased by blocking the activity of mitochondria and their contribution to the energy supply of the cells and using pharmacological agents that cause separation of processes of cellular respiration and oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, the conditions of energy blockade can be created in the perifocal area of the tumor. The aim was to study the possibility of increasing the influence of antitumor cytostatic by modeling damages of the energy forming processes in the peritumoral area of the tumor through the creation of metabolic acidosis.Experimental work fragment was carried out in 60 rats with sarcoma 45 (S45) transplanted under the back skin. Cyclophosphamide (C) was administered intraperitoneally twice at a dose of 5\u00a0mg/kg. On the tumor peritumoral area perimeter (in 4 points) 0.25\u00a0ml of a 1% solution of ATP or 1% solution of diphenhydramine (D) were administered. Clinical studies were performed on 60 patients diagnosed with breast cancer. These patients underwent two cycles of CMFA chemotherapy: C 800\u00a0mg/m2, methotrexate 30\u00a0mg/m2, fluorouracil 2000\u00a0mg/m2, doxorubicin 80\u00a0mg/m[b]; on a background of peritumoral injection of 0.5\u00a0ml of a 1% solution of ATP or 1% solution of D.Modelling of metabolic acidosis in peritumoral area was shown to result in dissociation of respiration processes and oxidative phosphorylation of cells (suppression of SDH activity by ATP by 62% and D by 57.9% and an increase in activity of \u03b1GFDG by ATP and D by 154.7%) the ratio of SDH and \u03b1GFDG less than 1. Morphologic study of S45 showed the development of wide connective border in the subcapsular zone with the inclusion of red blood cells, lymphocytes, fibroblasts, histiocytes. The signs of tumor cell death by activation of apoptosis were observed: shrinkage and reduction in cell volume, chromatin hyper condensation, fragmentation of organelles and nucleus, a large amount of coarse bundles of microfilaments, the presence of apoptotic cells. Tumor tissue was infiltrated predominantly with CD3 and CD161a cells, CD45a indicators decreased by 3\u20134.5 times.The analysis of antitumor effect in breast cancer patients depending on factors of energy processes inhibition revealed that complete tumor regression only in combination with ATP occurred in 14.2%, and D-in 18.8%, partial regression using ATP was 71\u20135%, D \u2013 62.5%. Tumor progression was not observed.Modulating abnormalities in energy metabolism due to metabolic acidosis of tumor microenvironment on the background of systemic chemotherapy, one can achieve activation of additional pathogenetic mechanisms of inhibition of tumor growth and tumor cell death. It is necessary to emphasize the importance of the further search for factors of pathogenetic mechanisms and therapy of the influence on the tumor, including the modulation of acidosis of peritumoraly area that opens up new perspectives in solving this problem.",

The expression levels of miRNAs let-7a, miR-155, miR-205 were measured by real-time PCR.Our results demonstrated that LOH/MSI occurs only in tumor while promoter hypermethylation occurs also in adjacent tissue at 2, 5\u00a0cm, but not at 10\u00a0cm. The downregulation of let-7a, miR-155 in adjacent tissue is lower than in tumor. The levels of investigated miRNAs in adjacent tissue vary depending on tumor differentiation \u2013 in patients with differentiated tumors it is higher than in the group with poorly differentiated tumors.We postulate that FC size in NSCLC is at least 5\u00a0cm from tumor and includes only epigenetic but not structural (LOH/MSI) alterations.

     "abstract": "Cervical cancer is one of the most common female malignancies with incidence of 19.7 per 100,000 population in Russia in 2011 (Davydov, Aksel et al., 2011). Over 6000 women in Russia die of cervical cancer annually.The cervical cancer incidence shows a tendency towards increasing rates among young women (Chissov, 2009). Tomsk region has been found to be the territory of increased cancer risk for cervical cancer. The age-standardized incidence rate is 1.87 times higher in Tomsk region than in Russia, being 20.40/0000 (Pisareva, Odintsova et al., 2012). The highest incidence of cervical cancer is observed in women aged 15\u201339\u00a0years (Churuksaeva, Kolomiets, Shpileva, 2012). The causal role of human papillomavirus infections in cervical cancer has been documented beyond reasonable doubt. Prevention of exposure to high risk HPV types by vaccination may prove to be the most efficient and logistically feasible preventive intervention for cervical cancer.Epidemiological studies conducted at the Tomsk Cancer Research Institute have shown that the median age of patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical cancer is 39.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.5, and 89.5% of women are HPV-positive. Prevalence of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (H-SIL) peaks between ages 25\u00a0years and 30\u00a0years.The predominant HPV type in screened women of Tomsk region as well as worldwide is HPV-16, reaching peak incidence in women aged 36\u201340 years (74%). In the older age group (from 51 to 60\u00a0years), HPV-18 is associated with 25% of cervical cancer cases. High prevalence of HPV-31 has been found in women under the age of 45 years with an incidence peak (17%) in the age group \u2a7d20\u00a0years.The geographical widespread data on HPV type-distribution are essential for estimating the impact of vaccines on cervical cancer and cervical screening programs. Immunization against HPV for young women aged between 9 and 26\u00a0years, with a predominant age cohort 11\u201313\u00a0years, was introduced in Tomsk region in 2010. The aim of the HPV immunization program is to protect females before they reach an age when the risk of HPV infection increases. A total of 627 girls were vaccinated, and 1653 doses of vaccines were injected. The three- dose schedule was given to 414 (66%) girls and 2-dose schedule to 198 (31.6%) girls. Vaccine safety assessment was carried out. Adverse effects were observed in 9.6% of cases and were mainly characterized by dizziness and pain at the injection site. Vaccination was well tolerated.When calculating socio-economic feasibility of the proposed technology , not only the economic damage caused by the high mortality of women from cervical cancer, but also the cost for treatment of precancerous cervical lesions were taken into account, as out of 25 women with undetected CINII-III, 10 will develop cervical cancer. There have been calculated the estimated damage from cervical cancer in the Tomsk region, which takes into account not only the cost of diagnosis and treatment of cervical pre-cancer, but also losses associated with temporary permanent disabilities (social benefits, including disability pension before the age of 55\u00a0years). Calculations show that the total economic damage caused by the management of patients with cervical cancer, can be from 20 to 40\u00a0mln. rubles per year.Thus, primary prevention of cervical cancer, taking into account the prevalence of HPV infection and economic impact of cervical cancer can be considered as an effective technology for public health that will allow preservation of not only reproductive but also employment potential of women of Tomsk region.",

The incidence rate is 3.7\u20135.7 per 100,000 and the median survival is estimated to be between three and six years. The pathogenesis of myelofibrosis might be explained, in part, by a somatic point mutation on exon 14 (V617F) of the JAK2 kinase gene that is located on chromosome 9p24. However, mechanisms of regulation of microenvironment in bone marrow fibrosis are not clear. Considered that main producents of pro-fibrotic factors are the megakaryocytes and the macrophages. In this study we investigated influence of platelet factors on the cellular characteristics of the macrophages with oncogenic mutation JAK2 V617F.THP-1 cell line was modified by lentiviral modification. Two cell lines established: one with expression of JAK2 with oncogenic mutation JAK2 V617F, another wild type JAK2. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing 0.1% gentamicin, 1% l-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 5%, 10% and 15% platelet lysate (PL).

Also macrophages containing mutation JAK2 V617F has increased level of expression of MMP-2, TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 when cultured with 10% platelet lysate. Also, cell line containing mutation JAK2 V617F has increased levels of expression of MMP-12 for cells cultured with 15% PL. We did not observe any significant difference in expression of TGF\u03b2, MMP-9, TIMP-1 and -2.Increased levels of expression of galectin-3, MMP-12 and -13 suggest that platelet factors induce macrophages with JAK2 V617F mutation to release of profibrotic factors. On the other hand, increase of antifibrotic MMP-2 and TIMP-3 revealing complex nature of melofibrosis development and need to be analyzed further.This study confirms the idea of interaction between macrophages and platelets in pathogenesis of primary myelofibrosis.",

     "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the 5th most common cancer found in women in the UK. It is the leading cause of death from gynaecological cancer, and is the 4th most common cause of cancer death among UK women. Similar to the majority of other cancers, relative survival rates for ovarian cancer are improving, although 5-year mortality rates remain stubbornly low. The stage of the disease at diagnosis is the single most important determinant of ovarian cancer survival, as many patients first present with advanced disease. Treatment of ovarian cancer involves a combination of \u2018upfront\u2019 primary surgery followed by chemotherapy. Platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy is the recommended standard-of-care first-line chemotherapy, but the majority of patients will relapse with drug-resistant disease within 3-5 years. However, not all patients can continue with platinum combination therapies due to loss of activity or toxicity-related issues, including hypersensitivity, neurotoxicity, alopecia and ototoxicity. Therefore the choice of second-line chemotherapy must take into account factors such as platinum-free treatment interval (PFI); patient's performance status; current symptoms; history of and likely future toxicities while on chemotherapy; dosing schedule requirement; and cost of treatment. A consensus in 2010 established 4 distinct subgroups within the ROC patient population based on the PFI: (platinum sensitive <12 months, partially platinum sensitive 6-12 months, platinum resistant <6 months, and refractory disease \u22644 weeks). Within patients with platinum sensitive disease, those with partially platinum sensitive disease remain the most clinically challenging to manage effectively. Non-platinum based combination therapies, in particular trabectedin with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD), offers new options together with a significant survival advantage relative to PLD alone for these patients.",

     "abstract": "The choice of second-line chemotherapy in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) is complex, with several factors to be considered, the most important of which is the length of the platinum-free treatment interval (PFI). Recently ROC patients have been further stratified into platinum sensitive (PS), partially platinum sensitive (PPS) and platinum resistant (PR) subgroups depending on the length of the PFI. Response to second-line therapy, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) are linked to the PFI, all of them improving as the PFI increases. Consequently, there is increasing interest in PFI extension strategies with platinum-free therapeutic options. Such strategies are currently being studied in patients with partially platinum-sensitive disease (PFI 6-12 months), as the treatment of these patients remains clinically challenging. A non-platinum option, trabectedin + pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) combination, has been evaluated in ROC patients in the pivotal phase III OVA-301 study. The OVA-301 study differed from previous trials in the same setting as it included only patients who were not expected to benefit from or who were ineligible for or who were unwilling to receive re-treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, including those with PPS and PR disease. Subset analysis of patients with PPS disease in OVA-301 showed that the trabectedin + PLD combination significantly improved PFS compared with PLD alone; median PFS 7.4 versus 5.5 months, p=0.0152. Final survival data from the same subset of patients, showed that trabectedin + PLD also achieved a significant 36% decrease in the risk of death compared with PLD alone (HR=0.64; 95% CI, 0.47\u20130.88; p=0.0027). Median overall survival (OS) was 22.4 months in the trabectedin + PLD arm versus 16.4 months in the PLD arm. This represents a statistically significant 6-month improvement in median OS in patients treated with trabectedin + PLD compared to those treated with PLD alone.",

     "abstract": "Most patients with recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC) undergo a series of remissions and recurrences, therefore the additive or cumulative toxicity of chemotherapy must be factored into their treatment plan. There are challenges in defining tailored therapeutic approaches, including optimal timing and drug sequencing management strategies to treat patients with ROC. This is particularly relevant as new cytotoxic drugs and biological agents become available. Many of these drugs are associated with increased toxicity and with no observable survival advantage. Therefore current treatment options for the heavily-pretreated relapsing OC patient population are frequently guided by safety considerations and convenience. Rechallenge with platinum-based combination regimes is commonly limited by the risk of cumulative long-term toxicities. Not all patients can continue with platinum at second-line or, indeed, further relapses due to loss of activity or toxicity-related issues including hypersensitivity, neurotoxicity, alopecia and ototoxicity. In particular, hypersensitivity reactions are a concern and have been reported in approximately 15-20% of women receiving the drug. Trabectedin + PLD is a non-platinum combination that is well tolerated, with a manageable safety profile, which is independent of age.",

     "abstract": "Over the past decades, early diagnosis, new drugs and more personalised multi-modality treatment have led to impressive increases in survival rates of patients with cancer. This success in treating cancer has resulted in a large and rapidly increasing number of cancer survivors, yet life after cancer is often compromised by a broad spectrum of late adverse treatment effects. Some encounter cardiovascular, second malignancies, cognitive or other morbidities which impair normal life in an important way. Some patients are confronted with societal discrimination due to slower performance, chronic fatigue or partial inability and these things can adversely affect employment, education, insurance or mortgage opportunities.In 2012, the European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Survivorship Task Force was created to focus research efforts on late morbidity of cancer treatment and its impact on society. On 30\u201331st January 2014, the 1st EORTC Cancer Survivorship Summit was organised to facilitate interaction between clinicians, researchers, social workers, patients, insurers, bankers and policy makers. This important event addressed the needs of cancer survivors, and new collaborations between academic groups, patient advocates, financial and political representatives were formed to guide future European research and health policies in this field. This special issue of the European Journal of Cancer is entirely dedicated to this Summit and addresses, respectively, second malignancies, cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, infertility/sexuality and psycho-social problems following cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "Currently, 17\u201319% of all new primary malignancies occur in survivors of cancer, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Research has shown that cancer treatments are important contributors to second malignant neoplasm (SMN) risk.In this paper we summarise current knowledge with regard to treatment-related SMNs and provide recommendations for future research. We address the risks associated with radiotherapy and systemic treatments, modifying factors of treatment-related risks (genetic susceptibility, lifestyle) and the potential benefits of screening and interventions. Research priorities were identified during a workshop at the 2014 Cancer Survivorship Summit organised by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer.Recently, both systemic cancer treatments and radiotherapy approaches have evolved rapidly, with the carcinogenic potential of new treatments being unknown. Also, little knowledge is available about modifying factors of treatment-associated risk, such as genetic variants and lifestyle. Therefore, large prospective studies with biobanking, high quality treatment data (radiation dose\u2013volume, cumulative drug doses), and data on other cancer risk factors are needed. International collaboration will be essential to have adequate statistical power for such investigations. While screening for SMNs is included in several follow-up guidelines for cancer survivors, its effectiveness in this special population has not been demonstrated. Research into the pathogenesis, tumour characteristics and survival of SMNs is essential, as well as the development of interventions to reduce SMN-related morbidity and mortality. Prediction models for SMN risk are needed to inform initial treatment decisions, balancing chances of cure and SMNs and to identify high-risk subgroups of survivors eligible for screening.",

Unfortunately, many treatments carry a risk of late effects including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), possibly leading to significant morbidity and mortality. In this paper we describe current knowledge of the cardiotoxicity arising from cancer treatments, outline gaps in knowledge, and indicate directions for future research and guideline development, as discussed during the 2014 Cancer Survivorship Summit organised by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).Better knowledge is needed of the late effects of modern systemic treatments and of radiotherapy to critical structures of the heart, including the effect of both radiation dose and volume of the heart exposed. Research elucidating the extent to which treatments interact in causing CVD, and the mechanisms involved, as well as the extent to which treatments may increase CVD indirectly by increasing cardiovascular risk factors is also important. Systematic collection of data relating treatment details to late effects is needed, and great care is needed to obtain valid and generalisable results.Better knowledge of these cardiac effects will contribute to both primary and secondary prevention of late complications where exposure to cardiotoxic treatment is unavoidable. Also surrogate markers would help to identify patients at increased risk of cardiotoxicity. Evidence-based screening guidelines for CVD following cancer are also needed. Finally, risk prediction models should be developed to guide primary treatment choice and appropriate follow up after cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a common consequence of cancer treatment, affecting at least half of men and women treated for pelvic malignancies and over a quarter of people with other types of cancer. Problems are usually linked to damage to nerves, blood vessels, and hormones that underlie normal sexual function. Sexual dysfunction also may be associated with depression, anxiety, relationship conflict, and loss of self-esteem. Innovations in cancer treatment such as robotic surgery or more targeted radiation therapy have not had the anticipated result of reducing sexual dysfunction. Some new and effective cancer treatments, including aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer or chemoradiation for anal cancer also have very severe sexual morbidity. Cancer-related infertility is an issue for younger patients, who comprise a much smaller percentage of total cancer survivors. However, the long-term emotional impact of being unable to have a child after cancer can be extremely distressing. Advances in knowledge about how cancer treatments may damage fertility, as well as newer techniques to preserve fertility, offer hope to patients who have not completed their childbearing at cancer diagnosis. Unfortunately, surveys in industrialised nations confirm that many cancer patients are still not informed about potential changes to their sexual function or fertility, and all modalities of fertility preservation remain underutilised. After cancer treatment, many patients continue to have unmet needs for information about restoring sexual function or becoming a parent. Although more research is needed on optimal clinical practice, current studies suggest a multidisciplinary approach, including both medical and psychosocial treatment options.",

In this paper we provide a brief overview of selected physical and psychosocial health problems prevalent among cancer survivors, namely pain, fatigue, psychological distress and work participation. We also address issues surrounding self-management and e-Health interventions for cancer survivors, and programmes to encourage survivors to adopt healthier lifestyles. Finally, we discuss approaches to assessing health-related quality of life in cancer survivors, and the use of cancer registries in conducting psychosocial survivorship research. We highlight research and practice priorities in each of these areas. While the priorities vary per topic, common themes that emerged included: (1) Symptoms should not be viewed in isolation, but rather as part of a cluster of interrelated symptoms. This has implications for both understanding the aetiology of symptoms and for their treatment; (2) Psychosocial interventions need to be evidence-based, and where possible should be tailored to the needs of the individual cancer survivor. Relatively low cost interventions with self-management and e-Health elements may be appropriate for the majority of survivors, with resource intensive interventions being reserved for those most in need; (3) More effort should be devoted to disseminating and implementing interventions in practice, and to evaluating their cost-effectiveness; and (4) Greater attention should be paid to the needs of vulnerable and high-risk populations of survivors, including the socioeconomically disadvantaged and the elderly.",

     "abstract": "Radiation therapy significantly reduces by at least 70% the relative risk of local and regional recurrences for breast cancer after surgery. A positive influence on overall survival has been clearly demonstrated, especially for patients with a high absolute risk for locoregional recurrences. However, this is partially counterbalanced by late toxicity (dependent upon the radiation dose) especially to cardiac structures. Apart from this toxicity, a clear influence of radiation-therapy-related factors on functional and cosmetic outcome has also been demonstrated. Over time, technical improvements have led to a marked reduction in dose to the neighbouring organs, with a consequent drop in acute and late toxicity. This has also allowed the introduction of shorter radiation schedules, lowering the burden of treatment to the patient and the hospital. Several tools, techniques and guidelines have been developed to optimise the balance between the desired reduction in recurrence rates and side effects.The multidisciplinary team should discuss all available treatment options for every individual breast cancer patient. Individualisation of the selection of the optimal combination of treatments, depending on patient and tumour-related factors, is of utmost importance. Apart from direct tumour-related outcomes, cosmesis and potential side effects have to be taken into account. Counselling should include known risk factors for survival and complications, including comorbidity.",

     "abstract": "Neoadjuvant treatment in terms of preoperative radiotherapy reduces local recurrence in rectal cancer, but this improvement has little if any impact on overall survival. Currently performed optimal quality-controlled total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery for patients in the trial setting can be associated with very low local recurrence rates of less than 10% whether the patients receive radiotherapy or not. Hence metastatic disease is now the predominant issue. The concept of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is a potentially attractive additional or alternative strategy to radiotherapy to deal with metastases. However, randomised phase III trials, evaluating the addition of oxaliplatin at low doses plus preoperative fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy (CRT), have in the main failed to show a significant improvement on early pathological response, with the exception of the German CAO/ARO/AIO-04 study. The integration of biologically targeted agents into preoperative CRT has also not fulfilled expectations. The addition of cetuximab appears to achieve relatively low rates of pathological complete responses, and the addition of bevacizumab has raised concerns for excess surgical morbidity. As an alternative to concurrent chemoradiation (which delivers only 5\u20136\u00a0weeks of chemotherapy), potential options include an induction component of 6\u201312\u00a0weeks of NACT prior to radiotherapy or chemoradiation, or the addition of chemotherapy after short-course preoperative radiotherapy (SCPRT) or chemoradiation (defined as consolidation chemotherapy) which utilises the \u201cdead space\u201d of the interval between the end of chemoradiation and surgery, or delivering chemotherapy alone without any radiotherapy.",

Spontaneous remissions occur occasionally. 2. In about 5% of melanomas no primary tumour is found. The genetic aberrations of these tumours closely resemble those of cutaneous melanomas, and therefore are suggestive of spontaneous regressions of the primary tumours. 3. Both primary tumours and metastases often have brisk lymphocytic infiltrates, a phenomenon that is correlated with better outcome. 4. Studies of isolates of these tumour-infiltrating T lymphocytes have revealed that a proportion of these cells recognise melanoma antigens. 5. Melanomas respond to immunotherapy.These observations have led to over 30\u00a0years of research on immunotherapy for melanoma; many of these efforts have failed, with only a few exceptions: interleukin-2 (IL-2) and to a lesser degree interferon-a (IFN-\u3008). Recently, new developments in immunotherapy have revolutionised this treatment modality. Anti-CTLA4 has received approval from the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of stage IV melanomas based on the improvement in overall survival in phase III trials, and more recently blockade of PD1/PDL1 interactions has shown objective clinical responses in a stage IV melanoma in early-phase clinical trials. In addition, several independent single-institution phase I/II trials using adoptive cell therapy have shown a consistently high response rate, including durable complete remissions in a substantial percentage of treated patients.Now, for the first time, immunotherapy has moved beyond the treatment of melanoma as both CTLA4 and PD1 blockade have been shown to induce objective responses in other tumour types as well.This chapter will discuss the mechanism of action, clinical efficacy and side effects of IL-2, the novel treatments consisting of the immune checkpoint blockade drugs anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1 and adoptive cell therapy.",

     "abstract": "Surgical resection remains the standard of care for functionally operable early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and resectable stage IIIA disease. The role of invasive staging and restaging techniques is currently being debated, but they provide the largest biopsy samples which allow for precise mediastinal staging. Different types of operative procedures are currently available to the thoracic surgeon, and some of these interventions can be performed by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) with the same oncological results as those by open thoracotomy. The principal aim of surgical treatment for NSCLC is to obtain a complete resection which has been precisely defined by a working group of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC). Intraoperative staging of lung cancer is of utmost importance to decide on the extent of resection according to the intraoperative tumour (T) and nodal (N) status. Systematic nodal dissection is generally advocated to evaluate the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes which are subdivided into seven zones according to the most recent 7th tumour-node-metastasis (TNM) classification. Lymph-node involvement not only determines prognosis but also the administration of adjuvant therapy.In 2011, a new multidisciplinary adenocarcinoma classification was published introducing the concepts of adenocarcinoma in situ and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. This classification has profound surgical implications. The role of limited or sublobar resection, comprising anatomical segmentectomy and wide wedge resection, is reconsidered for early-stage lesions which are more frequently encountered with the recently introduced large screening programmes. Numerous retrospective non-randomised studies suggest that sublobar resection may be an acceptable surgical treatment for early lung cancers, also when performed by VATS.More tailored, personalised therapy has recently been introduced. Quality-of-life parameters and surgical quality indicators become increasingly important to determine the short-term and long-term impact of a surgical procedure. International databases currently collect extensive surgical data, allowing more precise calculation of mortality and morbidity according to predefined risk factors. Centralisation of care has been shown to improve results. Evidence-based guidelines should be further developed to provide optimal staging and therapeutic algorithms.",

     "abstract": "Most long-term survivors of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are patients who have had a completely resected tumour. However, this is only achievable in about 30% of the patients. Even in this highly selected group of patients, there is still a high risk of both local and distant failure. Adjuvant treatments such as chemotherapy (CT) and radiotherapy (RT) have therefore been evaluated in order to improve their outcome. In patients with stage II and III, administration of adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy is now considered the standard of care, based on level 1 evidence. The role of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) remains controversial. In the PORT meta-analysis published in 1998, the conclusions were that if PORT was detrimental to patients with stage I and II completely resected NSCLC, the role of PORT in the treatment of tumours with N2 involvement was unclear and further research was warranted. Thus at present, after complete resection, adjuvant radiotherapy should not be administered in patients with early lung cancer. Recent retrospective and non-randomised studies, as well as subgroup analyses of recent randomised trials evaluating adjuvant chemotherapy, provide evidence of the possible benefit of PORT in patients with mediastinal nodal involvement. The role of PORT needs to be evaluated also for patients with proven N2 disease who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery. The risk of local recurrence for N2 patients varies between 20% and 60%. Based on currently available data, PORT should be discussed for fit patients with completely resected NSCLC with N2 nodal involvement, preferably after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy or after surgery if patients have had preoperative chemotherapy. There is a need for new randomised evidence to reassess PORT using modern three-dimensional conformal radiation technique, with attention to normal organ sparing, particularly lung and heart, to reduce the possible over-added toxicity. Quality assurance of radiotherapy as well as quality of surgery \u2013 and most particularly nodal exploration modality \u2013 should both be monitored. A new large multi-institutional randomised trial Lung ART evaluating PORT in this patient population is needed and is now under way.",

In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) the tumour\u2013node\u2013metastasis (TNM) classification developed by Pierre Denoix replaced in 1968 the Veterans Administration Lung cancer Group (VALG) classification, which was still in use for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). Clifton Mountain suggested several improvements based on a database of mostly surgically treated United States (US) patients from a limited number of centres. This database was pivotal for a uniform reporting of lung cancer extent by the American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) and the International Union against Cancer (IUCC), but it suffered increasingly from obsolete diagnostic and staging procedures and did not reflect new treatment modalities. Moreover, its findings were not externally validated in large Japanese and European databases, resulting in persisting controversies which could not be solved with the available database. The use of different mediastinal lymph-node maps in Japan, the (US) and Europe facilitated neither the exchange nor the comparison of treatment results.Peter Goldstraw, a United Kingdom (UK) thoracic surgeon, started the process of updating the sixth version in 1996 and brought it to a good end 10\u00a0years later. His goals were to improve the TNM system in lung cancer by addressing the ongoing controversies, to validate the modifications and additional descriptors, to validate the TNM for use in staging SCLC and carcinoid tumours, to propose a new uniform lymph-node map and to investigate the prognostic value of non-anatomical factors. A staging committee was formed within the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) \u2013 which supervised the collection of the retrospective data from >100,000 patients with lung cancer \u2013 treated throughout the world between 1990 and 2000, analyse them with the help of solid statistics and validate externally with the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database.The ten modifications and the mediastinal lymph-node map \u2013 which were proposed in 2007 and adopted by the AJCC and IUCC in their respective seventh revision of the TNM system \u2013 were implemented as of 2010 and were rapidly adopted by the thoracic oncology community and cancer registries. As expected, not all controversies could be fully addressed, and the need for a prospective data set containing more granular information was felt early on. This data set of 25,000 consecutive incident cases will form the base for the eighth revision in 2017 and is currently being collected. Other threats are the role of stage migration and the increasing number of biological factors interfering with disease extent for prognostication. The latter issue will be addressed by the creation of a prognostic index, including several prognostic factors, of which stage will be one.For the time being, the seventh TNM classification is considered the gold standard for the description of disease extent, initial treatment allocation and the reporting of treatment results. The uniform use of the TNM descriptors and the lymph-node map by all involved in lung cancer care is to be considered a process indicator of quality.",

     "abstract": "Since the creation of the EORTC Headquarters in 1974, major advances have been made in the methodology used in the design and analysis of cancer clinical trials. However, the speed of these developments in the fields of biology, medicine, and statistics has greatly increased since the turn of the 21st century. These changes have all become possible because of the increased computer power now available.The landscape of therapeutic anti-cancer development changed completely with the advent of the so-called \u201ctargeted agents\u201d that treat the underlying molecular basis of the disease rather than the symptoms of tumor proliferation. The new challenges posed by the clinical development of these numerous new agents that are expected to work in often yet-to-be-identified subgroups of patients induced a new wave of methodological developments. Some of these were readily embraced by the EORTC Headquarters statistics department, while others met with opposition. Our assessment is still in progress in many areas. Trials tend to become increasingly complex so that their planning relies on an increasing number of unknown parameters that need to be monitored during the trial itself, one development being \u201cadaptive\u201d design methodology.Because the knowledge required to design these new and more complex clinical trials and associated research program spans more disciplines (biology, genomics, radiology) and involves specialized knowledge within those disciplines, continued success requires further developing our partnerships with specialized departments (imaging, bio-informatics, biology, etc.) within EORTC Headquarters and in EORTC affiliated centers as well as collaborations with specialized statisticians from academia.",

     "abstract": "Over the past decade a series of trials of the EORTC Brain Tumor Group (BTG) has substantially influenced and shaped the standard-of-care of primary brain tumors. All these trials were coupled with biological research that has allowed for better understanding of the biology of these tumors. In glioblastoma, EORTC trial 26981/22981 conducted jointly with the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group showed superiority of concomitant radiochemotherapy with temozolomide over radiotherapy alone. It also identified the first predictive marker for benefit from alkylating agent chemotherapy in glioblastoma, the methylation of the O6-methyl-guanyl-methly-transferase (MGMT) gene promoter. In another large randomized trial, EORTC 26951, adjuvant chemotherapy in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors was investigated. Despite an improvement in progression-free survival this did not translate into a survival benefit. The third example of a landmark trial is the EORTC 22845 trial. This trial led by the EORTC Radiation Oncology Group forms the basis for an expectative approach to patients with low-grade glioma, as early radiotherapy indeed prolongs time to tumor progression but with no benefit in overall survival. This trial is the key reference in deciding at what time in their disease adult patients with low-grade glioma should be irradiated.Future initiatives will continue to focus on the conduct of controlled trials, rational academic drug development as well as systematic evaluation of tumor tissue including biomarker development for personalized therapy. Important lessons learned in neurooncology are to dare to ask real questions rather than merely rapidly testing new compounds, and the value of well designed trials, including the presence of controls, central pathology review, strict radiology protocols and biobanking. Structurally, the EORTC BTG has evolved into a multidisciplinary group with strong transatlantic alliances. It has contributed to the maturation of neurooncology within the oncological sciences.",

The main goal of the BCG is to conduct high-quality international clinical trials covering all areas of breast cancer care: from loco-regional to systemic disease control, and from in situ carcinoma to metastatic disease. Over 50 years, the BCG has performed dozens of clinical studies including several thousands of patients. Many practice-changing trials and major achievements were conducted optimizing local control, improving systemic therapy in early and metastatic breast cancer, pioneering work in clinical-translational trials and collaboration within intergroup trials. The strategic plan of the BCG for future research includes three distinct albeit overlapping areas: loco-regional therapy, (neo-)adjuvant systemic therapy, trials in the metastatic setting, and niche population studies. For each of these areas the group has considered the prevailing EORTC strategy of focusing on practice-changing studies and translational research, with an emphasis on niche trials. During five decades, the BCG has successfully performed a series of practice-changing trials enrolling several thousands of patients. These studies have contributed to the clinical knowledge on the treatment of breast cancer and have influenced clinical practice and breast cancer patients' outcome worldwide.",

After a decade of collaboration in the adult-pediatric group it became clear that there was not only a large difference in cure rates between children and adults, but many chemotherapeutic-toxic borders were substantially different. During the following decade the CLG was not only a witness of a very exciting battle against childhood leukemia, but it also contributed substantially to better cure rates for these diseases.The main activity of the CLG was concentrated on the field of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fine tuning of treatment elements using the BFM design as a backbone has been done very successfully over the past decades. The CLG has many achievements, and the major ones include: the 58831 trial showing the superfluity of the prophylactic Central Nervous System (CNS) radiotherapy in ALL patients when a adequate systemic and CNS directed chemotherapy is ascertained. The 58881 trial demonstrated that the assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) at completion of induction in ALL is a key step in the process to categorizing and allocating patients into different risk groups, and that MRD is a powerful and independent prognostic factor. This same 58881 trial showed the clear difference in efficacy of different asparaginases resulting in an optimization of the use these drugs and a revival of interest for the asparaginases in the treatment of ALL.In the near future the CLG will focus mainly on translational research projects and innovative biologically targeted treatment approaches, on collaborations with other children's leukemia groups in intergroup studies, and on the evaluation of the long-term outcome of childhood cancer survivors.",

     "abstract": "The EORTC Leukemia Group (LG) has a long history of promoting the study of leukemias and related malignancies and reports here on three of their most significant achievements. In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the LG and Italian group GIMEMA started their fruitful collaboration in 1986 with the AML-8 trial with 1519 inclusions. In the AML-8A trial, in patients who reached complete remission, without a HLA identical sibling, autograft provided longer disease-free survival than a second course of consolidation, whereas the best outcome was observed in patients with a donor, who had to be allografted. The AML-10 trial set a new standard of treatment for induction/consolidation with replacement of daunorubicin by either idarubicin or mitoxantrone. The AML-12 trial tested the effect of high-dose cytosine-arabinoside during induction (2109 inclusions, data base locked in August 2011 for final analysis). Development of intergroup trials focusing on subgroups of AML bearing specific genetic abnormalities is now mandatory to validate the \u201ctargeted approach\u201d of driving molecular events. In high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), the phase III trial conducted by the LG in collaboration with the German MDS Study Group showed that the response rate of decitabine versus best supportive care was higher (complete or partial remissions, 19% versus 0%, and hematologic improvement, 15% versus 2%), progression-free survival was significantly prolonged (median 6.6 versus 3 months), cumulative incidence of AML was significantly decreased (22% versus 33% at one year), but the impact on OS was less evident (median 10.1 versus 8.5 months; hazard ratio 0.88). Quality of life had improved significantly in patients in the decitabine arm. The assessment of HDAC inhibitors, such as vorinostat, will probably be tested in the next trial. Also in MDS, relevant genetic lesions involved in the pathogenesis of this disease were identified using single nucleotide polymorphisms array-based genomic profiling and genomic sequencing in 102 patients with MDS. Acquired abnormalities of the TET2 gene were identified in 26% of the cases and in the EZH2 gene in 5-10% of the patients. TET2 mutations were detected in 96% of the bone marrow cells, including CD34+ progenitor cells, suggesting that TET2 mutations could be an early event during disease evolution. In normal bone marrow, TET2 expression was elevated in granulocytes, suggesting a role in myelopoiesis.Conclusion: during the last 25 years the EORTC LG in cooperation with GIMEMA made a considerable contribution to the improvement of treatment results of patients with acute leukemia or MDS.",

The EORTC Quality of Life Department (QL Department) was founded in 1993 with the support of an EU grant to provide administrative, practical and scientific support to co-operative groups conducting clinical trials with HRQOL outcomes.We are proud to report significant scientific achievements that have made us international leaders in HRQOL research and have led to real changes to cancer patient treatments.We developed a modular system for HRQOL measurement consisting of the EORTC QLQ-C30, a core cancer quality of life questionnaire and supplementary questionnaire modules. The EORTC-QLQ-C30 has been one of the most widely used cancer questionnaires in randomized trials in oncology as demonstrated by systematic reviews. To date, the EORTC QLQ-C30 has been translated and linguistically validated into more than 60 languages.HRQOL outcome measures have been an integral part of EORTC clinical trials for the last 30 years. We present examples of significant, practice-changing clinical trials evaluating HRQOL in several cancer sites, such as brain tumors, breast and ovarian cancers, and malignant melanoma. In a series of systematic reviews, we examined the quality of reporting HRQOL in international cancer clinical trials, and the impact of the results on oncology practice that led to a recommendation to improve CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) with regard to reporting of HRQOL.The QLG is an international leader in methodological research in the measurement of HRQOL in oncology and pursues research in several key areas, such as cross-cultural differences between populations in HRQOL assessment, Computer-Adaptive Testing, electronic administration of EORTC QLQ-C30, and summary scores for EORTC QLQ-C30.In summary, the QLG and QL Department have been international leaders in the field.

     "abstract": "After the foundation of the EORTC in 1962, the Radio-Chemotherapy Group within this organization split in 1973 into two groups. One of these groups, concentrating on Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma, later became the Lymphoma Group while the other became the Radiotherapy Group. During the 1990's the latter changed its name to the Radiation Oncology Group (ROG), underscoring its position within the field of multidisciplinary oncology research. By 2011 the ROG had initiated or participated in 83 clinical studies, of which more than 73% were randomized phase III trials. It has concentrated on almost every disease site from brain to gynecological tumors with emphasis on brain, head and neck, breast, prostate, and lower gastro-intestinal tumours. The ROG has published several hundreds peer-reviewed articles, including publications in prestigious journals such as the New England Journal of Medicine or Lancet Oncology. Since its foundation, the ROG has understood the importance of conducting a proper Radiotherapy Quality Assurance (RT-QA) program for every clinical trial aiming at guaranteeing the quality of radiotherapy, i.e. minimizing any uncertainties in the conduction of trials. As radiotherapy evolved from two-dimensional to Intensity Modulated Radio Therapy, this program has progressively matured with time to be part of a worldwide RT-QA consortium in 2012.",

     "abstract": "The EORTC Soft Tissue and Bone Sarcoma Group (STBSG) develops, stimulates, and coordinates studies on all aspects of sarcomas, and over the years they have made significant achievements in the research and treatment of sarcomas. Through EORTC trials 62001, 62005, 62024, and 62063, they established imatinib in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Because the STBSG has conducted a large number of clinical trials in advanced disease and collected and stored all trial data in a consistent format, they were able to use these data in retrospective studies and develop progression-free survival as the primary endpoint for phase II studies in advanced soft-tissue sarcoma. This database also served as a basis for research projects analyzing subgroups of tumors like malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, and for exploring prognostic and predictive factors for first-line chemotherapy including ifosfamide, and proved to be of value when analyzing the results of adjuvant chemotherapy in adolescents and young adults as compared to the adult patient population. This article describes these achievements and looks into the future strategy of the STBSG.",

     "abstract": "Since their introduction in the 1960s, anthracyclines such as doxorubicin have attained a central place in the management of a number of solid tumours and haematological malignancies. Anthracycline-based regimens constitute a standard of care in patients with metastatic breast cancer; anthracycline monotherapy compares favourably with taxanes alone, while combinations of anthracyclines and taxanes have been shown to be superior to anthracycline-based regimens in terms of response rates and progression-free survival. Similarly, in patients with early breast cancer, adjuvant therapy with anthracycline-based regimens significantly reduces breast cancer mortality, compared with cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-fluorouracil regimens. However, a major limitation to the use of anthracyclines is cumulative cardiotoxicity, which can result in irreversible congestive heart failure. A number of strategies to reduce cardiotoxicity have been investigated, including modification of the dosing regimen, use of cardioprotective agents, and the development of liposomal doxorubicin formulations. The central place of anthracyclines in breast cancer management is likely to continue: the challenge now is to identify those patients most likely to respond to, and benefit from, anthracyclinebased therapy.",

     "abstract": "Anthracycline-based regimens form a cornerstone of the adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Extensive data from clinical trials with long-term follow-up have shown that such regimens significantly prolong overall and disease-free survival, compared with non-anthracycline-based regimens. In recent years, however, the proven benefits of anthracyclines have been challenged because of concerns over toxicity, and evidence that the benefits may be confined to certain patient subgroups, such as those with over-expression of the HER2 or TOP2A genes. Nevertheless, the available evidence suggests that it is premature to consider discarding anthracycline therapy. Although cardiotoxicity is a recognised limitation of long-term anthracycline treatment, clinically overt heart failure is uncommon and associated mortality is low. Similarly, the risk of acute myeloid leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome is low during anthracycline treatment. Although there are some data to suggest that the efficacy of anthracyclines may vary between patient subgroups, reliable prospective data to support this are sparse. Future prospective studies, and advances in the identification and validation of potential tumour biomarkers, can be expected to facilitate the targeting of anthracycline therapy to patients who are most likely to benefit.",

     "abstract": "Metastatic breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and hence it is desirable to have a variety of treatment options to meet different treatment aims in individual patients. Anthracyclines are extremely effective single agents in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, and combination therapy with anthracycline-containing regimens significantly improves response rates and progression-free survival, compared with non-anthracycline regimens. The addition of taxanes further increases the efficacy of anthracyclines as first-line therapy. Combination therapy with trastuzumab, taxanes and anthracyclines has been shown to produce significant improvements in survival, compared with taxanes and anthracyclines alone; however, trastuzumab is associated with significant cardiotoxicity, and augments the cardiotoxicity associated with anthracycline-based regimens. New anthracycline formulations such as non-pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (NPLD) have an important role in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. NPLD is as effective as conventional doxorubicin formulations, and can be combined with trastuzumab with acceptable toxicity. However, a number of questions remain as to how anthracycline therapy can be optimised. Ultimately, the choice of regimen will require a balance between efficacy and the impact of treatment on the patient's quality of life.",

     "abstract": "The past decade has seen extensive research into potential markers of responsiveness to anthracycline therapy in breast cancer patients; however, such markers have remained elusive. The status of both human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and topoisomerase II alpha (TOP2A) genes has been investigated in this context, but neither can be considered a clinically reliable predictor of response to anthracyclines. Expression of the TOP2A protein is affected by a number of factors not always related to gene copy number, and these might provide future potential markers. Recent studies have suggested that stroma-related signatures could predict anthracycline resistance, and increased expression of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1 (TIMP1) has also been implicated in resistance. Deficiency of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may render cells more sensitive to topoisomerase inhibitors such as anthracyclines by disrupting repair of damaged DNA. Chromosome 17 polysomy has also been associated with increased responsiveness to anthracyclines. Given the complexity of topoisomerases and DNA repair pathways, it may be that a multifactorial approach, rather than reliance on a single biomarker, is needed to identify anthracycline-sensitive patients.",

     "abstract": "Growing understanding of the molecular characteristics of breast cancer is raising the possibility of ultimately delivering therapies that are tailored to the tumour biology of the individual patient. Agents that are currently being evaluated in metastatic breast cancer, irrespective of specific markers such as human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) or oestrogen receptor, include the novel microtubule inhibitor eribulin mesylate, and a monoclonal antibody directed against vascular endothelial growth factor-A, bevacizumab. Denosumab, a receptor activator of nuclear factor (B ligand (RANKL) inhibitor, has recently been demonstrated to improve bone-related m\u00e9tastases in patients with breast cancer, irrespective of biological phenotype. Targeted therapies directed against DNA repair mechanisms such as poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) may prove particularly useful in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer. Turning to the adjuvant setting in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, recent studies have shown that concomitant treatment with taxanes and trastuzumab improves survival, and data with novel anti-HER2 agents are emerging. Current adjuvant and metastatic studies are evaluating novel targeted treatments aimed at HER2 and other targets. Molecular profiling of tumours is providing and will further provide the needed answers related to therapeutic optimisation.",

     "abstract": "The management of cancer in elderly patients is a complex area that requires specialist expertise. Historically, elderly patients have been under-represented in clinical trials, though this situation is improving, and hence there is a lack of evidence on which to base authoritative guidelines. A comprehensive geriatric assessment can be useful in assessing the patient's overall health status and life expectancy, and hence in guiding treatment decisions. Elderly patients who are fit, or who have medical problems that are amenable to treatment, should receive the same care as younger patients, whereas unfit or frail patients may require interventions tailored to geriatric patients, such as non-aggressive treatment and that age per se should not be a contraindication to such treatment in an otherwise healthy elderly patient. However, anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity is a particular concern in elderly patients because this group is more susceptible to the cardiotoxic effects of anthracyclines than younger patients, and hence heart failure may develop at lower cumulative doses. A recent expert opinion on anthracycline use in elderly patients, published by the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG), recommends screening to identify patients at high risk of cardiotoxicity, the use of agents with a low cardiotoxicity risk, such as liposomal doxorubicin formulations, and regular monitoring of cardiac function during treatment.",

     "abstract": "The advances made in recent years in high frequency ultrasound (US) transducer technology using broad bandwidth and high-dynamic range technology have led to considerable improvements in two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) greyscale diagnostic imaging of the breast. The role of elastography, focusing on the differentiation between benign and malignant lesions, continues to be evaluated. US is the method of choice to assess and sample, with core biopsy, most breast abnormalities, while stereotactical guided vacuum assisted biopsy (VAB) is the method of choice to sample screen-detected microcalcifications and architectural distortions not seen on US. In the dense breast, the addition of US to screening mammography improves the sensitivity for cancer considerably. The mean supplemental diagnostic yield of US after negative mammography is 3.2 per 1000 women with dense breasts. US is the first line imaging technique for symptomatic breast patients and women under the age of 40. The International Breast Ultrasound School (IBUS) and Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) breast US guidelines have introduced some consistency to examination technique and reporting. Intraoperative surgeon-performed ultrasound focuses on the accurate definition of the resection segment or sector and the margin analysis of the resection specimen. US-guided VAB is being used increasingly for diagnosis of borderline lesions, to complete preoperative staging in patients with extensive ductal component and for therapeutic excision. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful preoperatively to assess the extent of ipsilateral disease and to exclude the contralateral breast cancer, particularly for women at increased risk of mammographically occult disease.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer deaths in western countries are falling due to screening and adjuvant therapy, but the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has not shown comparable advances. The most active single agents are taxanes, which extend both disease-free and overall survival. However, opportunities remain for improving outcome. Nanoparticle technology is proving a valuable addition to the pharmaceutical armamentarium, particularly in oncology. Its use to bind paclitaxel to human albumin (nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel; nab-paclitaxel; Abraxane\u00ae) ensures solubility of the taxane without the use of solvents and minimizes the risk of hypersensitivity reactions without premedication. The homogeneous colloidal suspension created allows rapid dispersal of unbound drug and linear pharmacokinetics. Albumin-mediated transport of paclitaxel across the endothelium facilitates uptake of drug, and a degree of tumour selectivity is achieved by the albumin-binding propensity of SPARC (Secreted Protein Acidic Rich in Cysteine), a substance expressed on and around many breast tumours. Clinical trials in first- and second-line MBC show that nab-paclitaxel is both more effective than solvent-based taxanes and associated with less severe neutropenia. Sensory neuropathy occurs but improves rapidly when compared with that caused by conventional taxanes. A clinical development programme is investigating nab-paclitaxel in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. The low incidence of neutropenia makes nab-paclitaxel a good candidate for combination with other cytotoxics. It is also being assessed when given with biologic agents such as trastuzumab and bevacizumab.",

These developments are welcome as a means of further extending progression-free and overall survival, and as a way of allowing us to tailor therapy to characteristics of the individual patient such as the molecular biology of their tumour, treatment history, and performance status. Targeting drug delivery to the tumour is a promising means of increasing the therapeutic index of highly active agents such as the taxanes, and nanoparticle albumin-bound (nab) paclitaxel is one such advance. This paper reviews the clinical trial background for nab-paclitaxel and three individual cases in which its use was judged especially appropriate. These include a patient with prior exposure to anthracycline and docetaxel needing second-line treatment for MBC, a patient requiring first-line treatment following adjuvant anthracycline, and a patient in whom flexible dosing was a potential advantage.",
