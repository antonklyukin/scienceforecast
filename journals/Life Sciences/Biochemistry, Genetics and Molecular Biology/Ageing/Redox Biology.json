     "abstract": "Advances in the field of redox biology have contributed to the understanding of the complexity of the thiol-based system in mediating signal transduction. The redox environment is the overall spatiotemporal balance of oxidation-reduction systems within the integrated compartments of the cell, tissues and whole organisms. The ratio of the reduced to disulfide glutathione redox couple (GSH:GSSG) is a key indicator of the redox environment and its associated cellular health. The reaction mechanisms of glutathione-dependent and related thiol-based enzymes play a fundamental role in the function of GSH as a redox regulator. Glutathione homeostasis is maintained by the balance of GSH synthesis (de novo and salvage pathways) and its utilization through its detoxification, thiol signalling, and antioxidant defence functions via GSH-dependent enzymes and free radical scavenging. As such, GSH acts in concert with the entire redox network to maintain reducing conditions in the cell. Caenorhabditis elegans offers a simple model to facilitate further understanding at the multicellular level of the physiological functions of GSH and the GSH-dependent redox network. This review discusses the C. elegans studies that have investigated glutathione and related systems of the redox network including; orthologs to the protein-encoding genes of GSH synthesis; glutathione peroxidases; glutathione-S-transferases; and the glutaredoxin, thioredoxin and peroxiredoxin systems.",

     "abstract": "Recently, clinical development of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) expanded from using them as a single agent to combining them with DNA-damaging therapy to derive additional therapeutic benefit from stimulated DNA damage. Furthermore, inhibiting PARP in cancers with BRCA1/2 mutations has been shown to be an effective synthetic lethality approach either as a single agent or in combination with the different DNA damaging agents: chemotherapy or ionizing radiation (IR). However, inherited BRCA1/2 mutations account only for 5\u201310% of breast cancers, 10\u201315% of ovarian cancers, and lesser for the other cancers. Hence, for most of the cancer patients with BRCA1/2-proficient tumors, sensitization to DNA-damaging agents with PARPi is significantly less effective. We recently demonstrated that moderate, non-toxic concentrations of NO-donors inhibited BRCA1 expression, with subsequent inhibition of error-free HRR and increase of error-prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). We also demonstrated that the effect of NO-dependent block of BRCA1 expression can only be achieved in the presence of oxidative stress, a condition that characterizes the tumor microenvironment and is also a potential effect of IR. Hence, NO-donors in combination with PARPi, with effects limited by tumor microenvironment and irradiated area, suggest a precise tumor-targeted approach for radio-sensitization of BRCA1/2-proficient tumors. The combination with NO-donors allows PARPi to be successfully applied to a wider variety of tumors. The present work demonstrates a new drug combination (NO-donors and PARP-inhibitors) which demonstrated a high potency in sensitization of wide variety of tumors to ionizing radiation treatment.",

According to transcriptome-based profiling, four molecular subgroups of MB have been revealed, namely WNT, SHH, Group 3 and Group 4. High MYC mRNA expression and MYC gene amplification in MB have been considered as indicators of poor prognosis. However, the role of c-Myc in MB biology is still not well established. In the present study, the effects of c-Myc activation in UW228-MycER MB cell line were investigated using 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) induction system. Upon 4-OHT stimulation, an increase in metabolic activity, large-cell/anaplastic (LC/A) phenotype and oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage were observed. However, 53BP1 foci were not implicated in DNA damage response. Instead, cofilin nuclear translocation, changes in F-actin cytoskeleton and the levels of cytoskeletal proteins were shown. Moreover, the telomere length was found to be unaffected that may be associated with the upregulation of TRF proteins. Transcription of nascent RNA (synthesis of new rRNA) and the expression of RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3/TIF-IA were also elevated. Moreover, increased levels of DNMT2, a modulator of stress responses, were observed. A small fraction of cells responded differently as oncogene-induced senescence was also noticed. We postulate that c-Myc-mediated modulation of genetic stability of MB cells may trigger cellular heterogeneity and affect adaptive responses to changing environment.",

However, to date, the eradication of APCs remains a major challenge. We previously reported a naturally occurring secolignan- Peperomin E (PepE) and its analog 6-methyl (hydroxyethyl) amino-2, 6-dihydropeperomin E (DMAPE) that selectively target and induce oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis in KG-1a CD34+ cells (an APCs-like cell line) in vitro. We therefore further evaluated the efficacy and the mechanism of action of these compounds in this study. We found that PepE and DMAPE have similar potential to eliminate primary APCs, with no substantial toxicities to the normal cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, these agents selectively inhibit TrxR1, an antioxidant enzyme aberrantly expressed in APCs, by covalently binding to its selenocysteine residue at the C-terminal redox center. TrxR1 inhibition mediated by PepE (DMAPE) leads to the formation of cellular selenium compromised thioredoxin reductase-derived apoptotic protein (SecTRAP), oxidation of Trx, induction of oxidative stress and finally activation of apoptosis of APCs. Our results demonstrate a potential anti-APCs molecular target \u2013 TrxR1 and provide valuable insights into the mechanism underlying PepE (DMAPE)-induced cytotoxicity of APCs, and support the further preclinical investigations on PepE (DMAPE)-related therapies for the treatment of relapsed AML.",

Each SD increment of ln-transformed plasma copper was associated with 104% higher odds (OR 2.04, 95%CI 1.82\u20132.28) increment in ORs of T2D. Meanwhile, compared with the GG genotype of rs2070424, the OR of T2D associated with AG and AA genotypes were 1.44 (95% CI 1.15\u20131.81) and 1.74 (95% CI 1.33\u20132.28), respectively.

AA-2\u03b2G protected hydrogen peroxide-induced cell death in murine macrophage RAW264.7\u202fcells. Treatment with AA-2\u03b2G eliminated oxidative stress and the ratio of cellular glutathione to glutathione disulfide more effectively than AA and AA-2\u03b1G. AA-2\u03b2G also significantly reduced the fluorescent intensity of DCFH-DA triggered by chemotherapeutic agent camptotehcin-11 but not fluorouracil. AA, AA-2\u03b1G, and AA-2\u03b2G significantly decreased Keap-1expression, and increased the expression levels of nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1. All compounds triggered the nuclear translocation of Nrf2, while the ability of AA-2\u03b2G to enhance the Nrf2-DNA binding affinity was approximately two fold as those of AA and AA-2\u03b1G. Sodium ascorbate cotransporters (SVCT) inhibitors, sulfinpyrazone, phloretin, and 3-O-methyglucose, potently abrogated the free radical scavenging activities of AA, AA-2\u03b1G, and AA-2\u03b2G. The cellular uptake efficacy of AA-2\u03b1G and AA-2\u03b2G was less than 10% of AA, while the inhibition of SVCT with sulfinpyrazone considerably diminished the uptake efficacy of these compounds. AA-2\u03b1G and AA-2\u03b2G are more stable in the Fenton reagents than AA.

Sustained inhibition of complex I produces mitochondrial dysfunction, which is related to oxidative injury and nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) neurodegeneration. This study aimed to identify disease-modifying treatments for PD. Unsubstituted phenothiazine (PTZ) is a small and uncharged aromatic imine that readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. PTZ lacks significant DA receptor-binding activity and, in the nanomolar range, exhibits protective effects via its potent free radical scavenging and anti-inflammatory activities. Given that DAergic neurons are highly vulnerable to oxidative damage and inflammation, we hypothesized that administration of PTZ might confer neuroprotection in different experimental models of PD. Our findings showed that PTZ rescues rotenone (ROT) toxicity in primary ventral midbrain neuronal cultures by preserving neuronal integrity and reducing protein thiol oxidation. Long-term treatment with PTZ improved animal weight, survival rate, and behavioral deficits in ROT-lesioned rats. PTZ protected DA content and fiber density in the striatum and DA neurons in the SN against the deleterious effects of ROT. Mitochondrial dysfunction, axonal impairment, oxidative insult, and inflammatory response were attenuated with PTZ therapy. Furthermore, we have provided a new insight into the molecular mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of PTZ.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce different cellular stress responses but can also mediate cellular signaling. Augmented levels of ROS are associated with aging, cancer as well as various metabolic and neurological disorders. ROS can also affect the efficacy and adverse effects of drugs. Although proteins are key mediators of most ROS effects, direct studies of ROS-modulated-protein function in the cellular context are very challenging. Therefore the understanding of specific roles of different proteins in cellular ROS responses is still relatively rudimentary. In the present work we show that Mass Spectrometry-Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (MS-CETSA) can directly monitor ROS and redox modulations of protein structure at the proteome level. By altering ROS levels in cultured human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lysates and intact cells, we detected CETSA responses in many proteins known to be redox sensitive, and also revealed novel candidate ROS sensitive proteins. Studies in intact cells treated with hydrogen peroxide and sulfasalazine, a ROS modulating drug, identified not only proteins that are directly modified, but also proteins reporting on downstream cellular effects. Comprehensive changes are seen on rate-limiting proteins regulating key cellular processes, including known redox control systems, protein degradation, epigenetic control and protein translational processes. Interestingly, concerted shifts on ATP-binding proteins revealed redox-induced modulation of ATP levels, which likely control many cellular processes. Collectively, these studies establish CETSA as a novel method for cellular studies of redox modulations of proteins, which implicated in a wide range of processes and for the discovery of CETSA-based biomarkers reporting on the efficacy as well as adverse effects of drugs.",

     "abstract": "Selenoprotein N (SELENON) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein whose loss of function leads to a congenital myopathy associated with insulin resistance (SEPN1-related myopathy). The exact cause of the insulin resistance in patients with SELENON loss of function is not known. Skeletal muscle is the main contributor to insulin-mediated glucose uptake, and a defect in this muscle-related mechanism triggers insulin resistance and glucose intolerance. We have studied the chain of events that connect the loss of SELENON with defects in insulin-mediated glucose uptake in muscle cells and the effects of this on muscle performance. Here, we show that saturated fatty acids are more lipotoxic in SELENON-devoid cells, and blunt the insulin-mediated glucose uptake of SELENON-devoid myotubes by increasing ER stress and mounting a maladaptive ER stress response. Furthermore, the hind limb skeletal muscles of SELENON KO mice fed a high-fat diet mirrors the features of saturated fatty acid-treated myotubes, and show signs of myopathy with a compromised force production. These findings suggest that the absence of SELENON together with a high-fat dietary regimen increases susceptibility to insulin resistance by triggering a chronic ER stress in skeletal muscle and muscle weakness.Importantly, our findings suggest that environmental cues eliciting ER stress in skeletal muscle (such as a high-fat diet) affect the pathological phenotype of SEPN1-related myopathy and can therefore contribute to the assessment of prognosis beyond simple genotype-phenotype correlations.",

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that mLDH contributes to striated muscle bioenergetic function. Mitochondria isolated from murine cardiac and skeletal muscle lacked an appreciable ability to respire on lactate in the absence or presence of exogenous NAD+. Although three weeks of treadmill running promoted physiologic cardiac growth, mitochondria isolated from the hearts of acutely exercised or exercise-adapted mice showed no further increase in lactate oxidation capacity. In all conditions tested, cardiac mitochondria respired at >20-fold higher levels with provision of pyruvate compared with lactate. Similarly, skeletal muscle mitochondria showed little capacity to respire on lactate. Protease protection assays of isolated cardiac mitochondria confirmed that LDH is not localized within the mitochondrion. We conclude that mLDH does not contribute to cardiac bioenergetics in mice.",

We report the discovery that reactive sulfane sulfur such as polysulfides and persulfides could be detected by using resonance synchronous spectroscopy (RS2). With RS2, we showed that inorganic polysulfides at low concentrations were unstable with a half-life about 1\u202fmin under physiological conditions due to reacting with glutathione. The protonated form of glutathione persulfide (GSSH) was electrophilic and had RS2 signal. GSS\u2212 was nucleophilic, prone to oxidation, but had no RS2 signal. Using this phenomenon, pKa of GSSH was determined as 6.9. GSSH/GSS\u2212 was 50-fold more reactive than H2S/HS\u2212 towards H2O2 at pH 7.4, supporting reactive sulfane sulfur species like GSSH/GSS\u2212 may act as antioxidants inside cells. Further, protein persulfides were shown to be in two forms: at pH 7.4 the deprotonated form (R-SS-) without RS2 signal was not reactive toward sulfite, and the protonated form (R-SSH) in the active site of a rhodanese had RS2 signal and readily reacted with sulfite to produce thiosulfate. These data suggest that RS2 of sulfane sulfur is likely associated with its electrophilicity. Sulfane sulfur showed species-specific RS2 spectra and intensities at physiological pH, which may reveal the relative abundance of a reactive sulfane sulfur species inside cells.",

Whereas the homozygote knockout mice were embryonically lethal, the heterozygote knockout mice had global reduction in DHFR protein expression and activity. Angiotensin II infusion into these animals resulted in substantially exaggerated elevation in blood pressure and development of AAA, which was accompanied by excessive eNOS uncoupling activity (featured by significantly impaired tetrahydrobiopterin and nitric oxide bioavailability), vascular remodeling (MMP2 activation, medial elastin breakdown and adventitial fibrosis) and inflammation (macrophage infiltration). Importantly, scavenging of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species with Mito-Tempo in vivo completely abrogated development of hypertension and AAA in DHFR knockout mice, indicating a novel role of mitochondria in mediating hypertension and AAA downstream of DHFR deficiency-dependent eNOS uncoupling. These data for the first time demonstrate that targeting DHFR-deficiency driven mitochondrial dysfunction may represent an innovative therapeutic option for the treatment of AAA and hypertension.",

The observed adaptive autophagic response was found to be independent of the upstream autophagy regulator mTOR but is accompanied by a significant upregulation of further downstream components of the canonical autophagy network such as Beclin1, WIPI1 and the transmembrane ATG9 proteins. Interestingly, the expression of the HSP70 co-chaperone BAG3, mediator of BAG3-mediated selective macroautophagy and highly relevant for the clearance of aggregated proteins in cells, was found to be increased in OxSR cells that were consequently able to effectively overcome proteotoxic stress. Overexpression of BAG3 in oxidative stress-sensitive HT22 wildtype cells partly established the vesicular phenotype and the enhanced autophagic flux seen in OxSR cells suggesting that BAG3 takes over an important part in the adaptation process. A full proteome analysis demonstrated additional changes in the expression of mitochondrial proteins, metabolic enzymes and different pathway regulators in OxSR cells as consequence of the adaptation to oxidative stress in addition to autophagy-related proteins. Taken together, this analysis revealed a wide variety of pathways and players that act as adaptive response to chronic redox stress in neuronal cells.",

     "abstract": "Glycosylation, a common modification of cellular proteins and lipids, is often altered in diseases and pathophysiological states such as hypoxia, yet the underlying molecular causes remain poorly understood. By utilizing lectin microarray glycan profiling, Golgi pH and redox screens, we show here that hypoxia inhibits terminal sialylation of N- and O-linked glycans in a HIF- independent manner by lowering Golgi oxidative potential. This redox state change was accompanied by loss of two surface-exposed disulfide bonds in the catalytic domain of the \u03b1-2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal-I) and its ability to functionally interact with B4GalT-I, an enzyme adding the preceding galactose to complex N-glycans. Mutagenesis of selected cysteine residues in ST6Gal-I mimicked these effects, and also rendered the enzyme inactive. Cells expressing the inactive mutant, but not those expressing the wild type ST6Gal-I, were able to proliferate and migrate normally, supporting the view that inactivation of the ST6Gal-I help cells to adapt to hypoxic environment. Structure comparisons revealed similar disulfide bonds also in ST3Gal-I, suggesting that this O-glycan and glycolipid modifying sialyltransferase is also sensitive to hypoxia and thereby contribute to attenuated sialylation of O-linked glycans in hypoxic cells. Collectively, these findings unveil a previously unknown redox switch in the Golgi apparatus that is responsible for the catalytic activation and cooperative functioning of ST6Gal-I with B4GalT-I.",

Pro-inflammatory cytokines produced in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) post-MI are associated with sympathetic overexcitation; however, the precise mechanism needs further investigation. Our aim was to explore the mechanism of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and its downstream molecular pathway in mediating sympathetic activity post-MI within the PVN. A rat MI model was developed via left anterior descending coronary artery ligation. TLR4 was primarily localized in microglia and increased markedly within the PVN at 3 days in MI rats. Sympathoexcitation also increased, as indicated by high levels of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and norepinephrine (NE) concentration. TLR4 knockdown via shRNA microinjection to the PVN resulted in decreased activation of Fos protein (+) neurons in the PVN and peripheral sympathetic nerve activity. TLR4 knockdown also exhibited a lower arrhythmia score following programmed electrical stimulation than those treated with MI surgery only, indicating that the knockdown of TLR4 decreased the incidence of malignant ventricular arrhythmias following MI. LPS-induced inflammatory response was analyzed to explore the underlying mechanism of TLR4 in sympathetic hyperactivity. High levels of NF-\u03baB protein, the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1, and ROS production were observed in the LPS group. PVN-targeted injection of the NF-\u03baB inhibitor PDTC attenuated NF-\u03baB expression and sympathetic activity. Taken together, the results suggested that knockdown of microglial TLR4 within the PVN decreased sympathetic hyperactivity and subsequent VAs post-MI. The downstream NF-\u03baB pathway and ROS production participated in the process. Interventions targeting TLR4 signaling in the PVN may be a novel approach to ameliorate the incidence of VAs post-MI.",

In this study, we have evaluated the neuroprotective effects of EpoL against oxidative stress induced by chronic treatment with A\u03b2. Our results show that EpoL was neuroprotective against A\u03b2-induced toxicity by a mechanism that implicates EpoR, reduction in reactive oxygen species, and reduction in astrogliosis. Furthermore, EpoL treatment improved calcium handling and SV2 levels. Interestingly, the neuroprotective effect of EpoL against oxidative stress induced by chronic A\u03b2 treatment was achieved at a concentration 10 times lower than that of Epo. In conclusion, EpoL, a new variant of Epo without hematopoietic activity, is of potential interest for the treatment of diseases related to oxidative stress in the CNS such as Alzheimer disease.",

NOX2 activation during HIIT was measured using an electroporated genetically-encoded biosensor. Immunoblotting and single-fiber microscopy was performed to measure classical exercise-training responsive endpoints in skeletal muscle.A single bout of HIIT increased NOX2 activity measured as p47-roGFP oxidation immediately after exercise but not 1\u202fh or 4\u202fh after exercise. After a 6-week HIIT regimen, improvements in maximal running capacity and some muscle training-markers responded less to HIIT in the ncf1* mice compared to WT, including superoxide dismutase 2, catalase, hexokinase II, pyruvate dehydrogenase and protein markers of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Strikingly, HIIT-training increased mitochondrial network area and decreased fragmentation in WT mice only.This study suggests that HIIT exercise increases NOX2 activity in skeletal muscle and shows that NOX2 activity is required for specific skeletal muscle adaptations to HIIT relating to antioxidant defense, glucose metabolism, and mitochondria.",

FoxO is a pro-inflammatory transcription factor that is a key mediator of generation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 in the liver. However, the detailed association of FoxO6 with insulin resistance and age-related inflammation has not been fully documented. Here, we showed that FoxO6 was elevated in the livers of aging rats and obese mice that exhibited insulin resistance. In addition, virus-mediated FoxO6 activation led to insulin resistance in mice with a notable increase in PAR2 and inflammatory signaling in the liver. On the other hand, FoxO6-KO mice showed reduced PAR2 signaling with a decrease in inflammatory cytokine expression and elevated insulin signaling. Because FoxO6 is closely associated with abnormal production of IL-1\u03b2 in the liver, we focused on the FoxO6/IL-1\u03b2/PAR2 axis to further examine mechanisms underlying FoxO6-mediated insulin resistance and inflammation in the liver. In vitro experiments showed that FoxO6 directly binds to and elevates IL-1\u03b2 expression. In turn, IL-1\u03b2 treatment elevated the protein levels of PAR2 with a significant decrease in hepatic insulin signaling, whereas PAR2-siRNA treatment abolished these effects. However, PAR2-siRNA treatment had no effect on IL-1\u03b2 expression induced by FoxO6, indicating that IL-1\u03b2 may not be downstream of PAR2. Taken together, we assume that FoxO6-mediated IL-1\u03b2 is involved in hepatic inflammation and insulin resistance via TF/PAR2 pathway in the liver.",

Although the total level of HSPB5 protein was not affected by exercise, we found a significantly increase of phosphorylated HSPB5 (p-HSPB5) only in GR and SOL skeletal muscle with a higher amount of type I and IIA/X myofibers. The fiber-specific activation of HSPB5 was correlated to its interaction with the actin filaments, as well as to an increased level of lipid peroxidation and carbonylated proteins. The role of the pro-oxidant environment in HSPB5 response was investigated in terminally differentiated C2C12 myotubes, where most of HSPB5/pHSPB5 pool was present in the cytosolic compartment in standard culture conditions. As a result of exposure to pro-oxidizing, but not cytotoxic, H2O2 concentration, the p-38MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of HSPB5 resulted functional to promote its interaction with the myofibrillar components, such as \u03b2-actin, desmin and filamin 1.This study provides novel information on the molecular pathway underlying the HSPB5 physiological function in skeletal muscle, confirming the contribution of the pro-oxidant environment in HSPB5 activation and interaction with substrate/client myofibrillar proteins, offering new insights for the study of myofibrillar myopathies and cardiomyopathies.",

To improve the RT efficacy on GBM, the mechanism causing tumor adaptive radioresistance which leads to the failure of tumor control and lethal progression needs to be further elucidated. Here, we conducted a comparative analysis of RT-treated recurrent tumors versus primary counterparts in GBM patients, RT-treated orthotopic GBM tumors xenografts versus untreated tumors and radioresistant GBM cells versus wild type cells. The results reveal that activation of STAT3, a well-defined redox-sensitive transcriptional factor, is causally linked with GBM adaptive radioresistance. Database analysis also agrees with the worse prognosis in GBM patients due to the STAT3 expression-associated low RT responsiveness. However, although the radioresistant GBM cells can be resensitized by inhibition of STAT3, a fraction of radioresistant cells can still survive the RT combined with STAT3 inhibition or CRISPR/Cas9-mediated STAT3 knockout. A complementally enhanced activation of ERK1/2 by STAT3 inhibition is identified responsible for the survival of the remaining resistant tumor cells. Dual inhibition of ERK1/2 and STAT3 remarkably eliminates resistant GBM cells and inhibits tumor regrowth. These findings demonstrate a previously unknown feature ofSTAT3-mediated ERK1/2 regulation and an effective combination of two targets in resensitizing GBM to RT.",

We report here the characterization of the first generated endogenous redox-inactive thioredoxin in an animal model, the TRX-1 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We find that TRX-1 dually regulates the formation of an endurance larval stage (dauer) by interacting with the insulin pathway in a redox-independent manner and the cGMP pathway in a redox-dependent manner. Moreover, the requirement of TRX-1 for the extended longevity of worms with compromised insulin signalling or under calorie restriction relies on TRX-1 redox activity. In contrast, the nuclear translocation of the SKN-1 transcription factor and increased LIPS-6 protein levels in the intestine upon trx-1 deficiency are strictly redox-independent. Finally, we identify a novel function of C. elegans TRX-1 in male food-leaving behaviour that is redox-dependent. Taken together, our results position C. elegans as an ideal model to gain mechanistic insight into the redox-independent functions of metazoan thioredoxins, overcoming the limitations imposed by the embryonic lethal phenotypes of thioredoxin mutants in higher organisms.",

Previous studies have shown that one member, PDIA3, interacts with influenza A virus (IAV) hemagglutinin (HA), and this interaction is required for efficient oxidative folding of HA in vitro. However, it is unknown whether these host-viral protein interactions occur during active infection and whether such interactions represent a putative target for the treatment of influenza infection. Here we show that PDIA3 is specifically upregulated in IAV-infected mouse or human lung epithelial cells and PDIA3 directly interacts with IAV-HA. Treatment with a PDI inhibitor, LOC14 inhibited PDIA3 activity in lung epithelial cells, decreased intramolecular disulfide bonds and subsequent oligomerization (maturation) of HA in both H1N1 (A/PR8/34) and H3N2 (X31, A/Aichi/68) infected lung epithelial cells. These reduced disulfide bond formation significantly decreased viral burden, and also pro-inflammatory responses from lung epithelial cells. Lung epithelial-specific deletion of PDIA3 in mice resulted in a significant decrease in viral burden and lung inflammatory-immune markers upon IAV infection, as well as significantly improved airway mechanics. Taken together, these results indicate that PDIA3 is required for effective influenza pathogenesis in vivo, and pharmacological inhibition of PDIs represents a promising new anti-influenza therapeutic strategy during pandemic and severe influenza seasons.",

     "abstract": "Decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia (PE). Recent evidence indicates that S-glutathionylation may occur on the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), leading to eNOS uncoupling, characterized by a decreased NO production and an increased generation of superoxide anion (O2\u2022\u2013). We hypothesized that eNOS glutathionylation may occur in PE placentas and participate in eNOS dysfunction.The glutathionylation of eNOS was investigated in thirteen PE-affected patients and in nine normal pregnancies. Immunofluorescence, confocal microscopy and western-blot experiments carried out on eNOS immunoprecipitates, revealed a high level of eNOS glutathionylation in PE placentas, mostly reversed by dithiotreitol (DTT), thus indicative of S-glutathionylation. In order to investigate whether eNOS glutathionylation may alter trophoblast migration, an important event occurring during early placentation, cultured HTR-8/SVneo human trophoblasts (HTR8) were exposed either to low pO2 (O2 1%) or to pO2 changes (O2 1\u201320%), in order to generate oxidative stress. Trophoblasts exposed to low pO2, did not undergo oxidative stress nor eNOS S-glutathionylation, and were able to generate NO and migrate in a wound closure model. In contrast, trophoblasts submitted to low/high pO2 changes, exhibited oxidative stress and a (DTT reversible) S-glutathionylation of eNOS, associated with reduced NO production and migration. The autonomous production of NO seemed necessary for the migratory potential of HTR8, as suggested by the inhibitory effect of eNOS silencing by small interfering RNAs, and the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME, in low pO2 conditions. Finally, the addition of the NO donor, NOC-18 (5\u202f\u00b5M), restored in part the migration of HTR8, thereby emphasizing the role of NO in trophoblast homeostasis.In conclusion, the high level of eNOS S-glutathionylation in PE placentas provides new insights in the mechanism of eNOS dysfunction in this disease.",

     "abstract": "M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) infiltration contributes to cancer malignant progression. However, the mechanisms for controlling recruitment and M2 polarization of macrophages by cancer cells are largely unclear. NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is abundantly expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and mediates cancer progression. NOXs are in close relation with cancer-related inflammation, nevertheless, whether tumoral NOXs influence microenvironmental macrophages remains undentified. This study found that there was a close association between NOX4 expression and macrophage chemotaxis in patients with NSCLC analyzed using TCGA RNA-sequencing data. NOX4 in NSCLC cells (A549 and Calu-1 cell lines) efficiently enhanced murine peritoneal macrophage migration and induces M2 polarization. Immunohistochemical analysis of clinical specimens confirmed the positive correlation of NOX4 and CD68 or CD206. The mechanical study revealed that tumoral NOX4-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulated various cytokine production, including CCL7, IL8, CSF-1 and VEGF-C, via PI3K/Akt signaling-dependent manner. Blockade of the function of these cytokines reversed NOX4 effect on macrophages. Specifically, the results showed that tumoral NOX4-educated M2 macrophages exhibited elevated JNK activity, expressed and released HB-EGF, thus facilitating NSCLC proliferation in vitro. Pretreatment of macrophages with JNK inhibitor blocked tumoral NOX4-induced HB-EGF production in M2 macrophages. Finally, in a xenograft mouse model, overexpression of NOX4 in A549 cells enhanced the tumor growth. Elimination of ROS by NAC or inhibition of NOX4 activity by GKT137831 suppressed tumor growth accompanied by reduction in macrophage infiltration and the percentage of M2 macrophages. In conclusion, our study indicates that tumoral NOX4 recruits M2 TAMs via ROS/PI3K signaling-dependent various cytokine production, thus contributing NSCLC cell growth.",

     "abstract": "The aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) into amyloid fibrils is a major pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. The mechanisms underlying the structural transition of soluble and innocuous \u03b1-syn to aggregated neurotoxic forms remains largely unknown. The disordered nature of \u03b1-syn has hampered the use of structure-based protein engineering approaches to elucidate the molecular determinants of this transition. The recent 3D structure of a pathogenic \u03b1-syn fibril provides a template for this kind of studies. The structure supports the NAC domain being a critical element in fibril formation, since it constitutes the core of the fibril, delineating a Greek-key motif. Here, we stapled the ends of this motif with a designed disulfide bond and evaluated its impact on the conformation, aggregation and toxicity of \u03b1-syn in different environments. The new covalent link biases the native structural ensemble of \u03b1-syn toward compact conformations, reducing the population of fully unfolded species. This conformational bias results in a strongly reduced fibril formation propensity both in the absence and in the presence of lipids and impedes the formation of neurotoxic oligomers. Our study does not support the Greek-key motif being already imprinted in early \u03b1-syn assemblies, discarding it as a druggable interface to prevent the initiation of fibrillation. In contrast, it suggests the stabilization of native, compact ensembles as a potential therapeutic strategy to avoid the formation of toxic species and to target the early stages of PD.",

     "abstract": "TAU protein aggregation is the main characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases known as tauopathies. Low-grade chronic inflammation is also another hallmark that indicates crosstalk between damaged neurons and glial cells. Previously, we have demonstrated that neurons overexpressing TAUP301L release CX3CL1, which activates the transcription factor NRF2 signalling to limit over-activation in microglial cells in vitro and in vivo. However, the connection between CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and NRF2 system and its functional implications in microglia are poorly described. We evaluated CX3CR1/NRF2 axis in the context of tauopathies and its implication in neuroinflammation. Regarding the molecular mechanisms that connect CX3CL1/CX3CR1 and NRF2 systems, we observed that in primary microglia from Cx3cr1-/- mice the mRNA levels of Nrf2 and its related genes were significantly decreased, establishing a direct linking between both systems. To determine functional relevance of CX3CR1, migration and phagocytosis assays were evaluated. CX3CR1-deficient microglia showed impaired cell migration and deficiency of phagocytosis, as previously described for NRF2-deficient microglia, reinforcing the idea of the relevance of the CX3CL1/CX3CR1 axis in these events. The importance of these findings was evident in a tauopathy mouse model where the effects of sulforaphane (SFN), an NRF2 inducer, were examined on neuroinflammation in Cx3cr1+/+ and Cx3cr1-/- mice. Interestingly, the treatment with SFN was able to modulate astrogliosis but failed to reduce microgliosis in Cx3cr1-/- mice. These findings suggest an essential role of the CX3CR1/NRF2 axis in microglial function and in tauopathies. Therefore, polymorphisms with loss of function in CX3CR1 or NRF2 have to be taken into account for the development of therapeutic strategies.",

We previously reported that p38\u03b1 (MAPK14), a redox-regulated p38MAPK family member was a negative regulator of the VSMC contractile phenotype in vitro. Here we evaluated the function of VSMC-MAPK14 in vivo in injury-induced neointima hyperplasia and the underlying mechanism using an inducible SMC-MAPK14 knockout mouse line (iSMC-MAPK14-/-). We show that MAPK14 expression and activity were induced in VSMCs after carotid artery ligation injury in mice and ex vivo cultured human saphenous veins. While the vasculature from iSMC-MAPK14-/- mice was indistinguishable from wildtype littermate controls at baseline, these mice exhibited reduced neointima formation following carotid artery ligation injury. Concomitantly, there was an increased VSMC contractile protein expression in the injured vessels and a decrease in proliferating cells. Blockade of MAPK14 through a selective inhibitor suppressed, while activation of MAPK14 by forced expression of an upstream MAPK14 kinase promoted VSMC proliferation in cultured VSMCs. Genome wide RNA array combined with VSMC lineage tracing studies uncovered that vascular injury evoked robust inflammatory responses including the activation of proinflammatory gene expression and accumulation of CD45 positive inflammatory cells, which were attenuated in iSMC-MAPK14-/- mice. Using multiple pharmacological and molecular approaches to manipulate MAPK14 pathway, we further confirmed the critical role of MAPK14 in activating proinflammatory gene expression in cultured VSMCs, which occurs in a p65/NFkB-dependent pathway. Finally, we found that NOX4 contributes to MAPK14 suppression of the VSMC contractile phenotype. Our results revealed that VSMC-MAPK14 is required for injury-induced neointima formation, likely through suppressing VSMC differentiation and promoting VSMC proliferation and inflammation.

     "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is linked to obesity and insulin resistance and is the most prevalent chronic liver disease. During the development of obesity and NAFLD, mitochondria adapt to the increased lipid load in hepatocytes by increasing the rate of fatty acid oxidation. In concert with this, reactive species (RS) generation is increased, damaging hepatocytes and inducing inflammation. Hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction is central to the pathogenesis of NAFLD via undefined mechanisms. There are no FDA approved treatments for NAFLD other than weight loss and management of glucose tolerance. Electrophilic nitro-oleic acid (NO2-OA) displays anti-inflammatory and antioxidant signaling actions, thus mitochondrial dysfunction, RS production and inflammatory responses to NO2-OA and the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone were evaluated in a murine model of insulin resistance and NAFLD. Mice on HFD for 20 wk displayed increased adiposity, insulin resistance and hepatic lipid accumulation (steatosis) compared to mice on normal chow (NC). The HFD mice had mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by lower hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity compared to mice on NC. Treatment with NO2-OA or rosiglitazone for the last 42 days (out of 20 wk) abrogated HFD-mediated decreases in hepatic mitochondrial complex I, IV and V activity. Notably, NO2-OA treatment normalized hepatic triglyceride levels and significantly reversed hepatic steatosis. Despite the improved glucose tolerance observed upon rosiglitazone treatment, liver weight and hepatic triglycerides were significantly increased over vehicle-treated HFD mice. These observations support that the pleiotropic signaling actions of electrophilic fatty acids limit the complex hepatic and systemic pathogenic responses instigated by obesity, without the adverse effects of thiazolidinedione drugs such as rosiglitazone.",

Hypoxia and oxidative stress are driving this condition, which implies an increase generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or decreased antioxidant capacity. Melatonin has antioxidant properties that decrease oxidative stress and improves pulmonary vascular function when administered postnatally. However, the effects of an antenatal treatment with melatonin in the neonatal pulmonary function and oxidative status are unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that an antenatal therapy with melatonin improves the pulmonary arterial pressure and antioxidant status in high altitude pulmonary hypertensive neonates. Twelve ewes were bred at high altitude (3600\u202fm); 6 of them were used as a control group (vehicle 1.4% ethanol) and 6 as a melatonin treated group (10\u202fmg\u202fd-1 melatonin in vehicle). Treatments were given once daily during the last third of gestation (100\u2013150 days). Lambs were born and raised with their mothers until 12 days old, and neonatal pulmonary arterial pressure and resistance, plasma antioxidant capacity and the lung oxidative status were determined. Furthermore, we measured the pulmonary expression and activity for the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and the oxidative stress markers 8-isoprostanes, 4HNE and nitrotyrosine. Finally, we assessed pulmonary pro-oxidant sources by the expression and function of NADPH oxidase, mitochondria and xanthine oxidase. Melatonin decreased the birth weight. However, melatonin enhanced the plasma antioxidant capacity and decreased the pulmonary antioxidant activity, associated with a diminished oxidative stress during postnatal life. Interestingly, melatonin also decreased ROS generation at the main pro-oxidant sources. Our findings suggest that antenatal administration of melatonin programs an enhanced antioxidant/pro-oxidant status, modulating ROS sources in the postnatal lung.",

This study is undertaken to characterize the effects of inhibition of NADPH oxidase by a widely used NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin on learning and memory deficits in paraquat and maneb-induced mouse PD model. Results showed that mice injected with paraquat and maneb displayed impairments of spatial learning and memory, which was associated with reduced tyrosine hydroxylase expression as well as increased neurodegeneration, synaptic loss, \u03b1-synuclein expression and Ser129-phosphorylation in the hippocampus. Interestingly, apocynin treatment significantly ameliorated learning and memory deficits as well as hippocampal neurodegeneration and \u03b1-synuclein pathology in mice treated with these two pesticides. Mechanistically, we found that apocynin mitigated paraquat and maneb-induced NADPH oxidase activation and related oxidative stress. Furthermore, reduced microglial activation and M1 polarization were observed in apocynin and paraquat and maneb co-treated mice compared with paraquat and maneb alone group. Finally, apocynin inhibited the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathways, two key regulatory factors for microglial M1 inflammatory responses, in paraquat and maneb-treated mice. Altogether, our findings implied that NADPH oxidase mediates learning and memory deficits in PD, and inhibition of NADPH oxidase by apocynin blocks impairments of learning and memory via the suppression of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation.",

Peroxiredoxin like 2A (PRXL2A) has been reported to be an antioxidant protein that protects cells from oxidative stress. Our previous study identified an association between PRXL2A upregulation in OSCC and a worse patient prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are involved in the modulation of biological/pathological properties. The miR-125 family of genes drive pluripotent regulation across a wide variety of cancers. In this study, we identify the oncogenic eligibility of PRXL2A and clarify miR-125b as its upstream regulator. Downregulation of miR-125b can be observed in OSCC tumors. Lower miR-125b expression in tumors results in a worse patient prognosis at the relatively early stage. Reporter assays are able to validate that PRXL2A is a direct target of miR-125b. Exogenous miR-125b expression in OSCC cells results in increased oxidative stress, increased drug sensitivity, and suppressor activity that is paralleled by the knockout of PRXL2A gene. The suppressor activity of miR-125b is able to be rescued by PRXL2A, which suggests the existence of a miR-125b-PRXL2A regulatory axis that is part of OSCC pathogenesis. Nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) was found to be a downstream effector of the miR-125b-PRXL2A cascade. As a whole, this study has pinpointed novel clues demonstrating that downregulation of miR-125b suppressor underlies upregulation of PRXL2A in OSCC, and this then protects the affected tumor cells from oxidative stress.",

Previous reports implicated bone morphogenetic protein antagonist Gremlin 1 in this process; however, little is known of the molecular mechanisms involved. The current study was designed to test whether redox signaling initiated by NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1) could promote transcription factor CREB activation by redox factor 1 (Ref-1), transactivation of Gremlin1 transcription, EC migration, and proliferation. Human pulmonary arterial EC (HPAECs) exposed in vitro to hypoxia to recapitulate PAH signaling displayed induced Nox1 expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, PKA activity, CREB phosphorylation, and CREB:CRE motif binding. These responses were abrogated by selective Nox1 inhibitor NoxA1ds and/or siRNA Nox1. Nox1-activated CREB migrated to the nucleus and bound to Ref-1 leading to CREB:CRE binding and Gremlin1 transcription. CHiP assay and CREB gene-silencing illustrated that CREB is pivotal for hypoxia-induced Gremlin1, which, in turn, stimulates EC proliferation and migration. In vivo, participation of Nox1, CREB, and Gremlin1, as well as CREB:CRE binding was corroborated in a rat PAH model. Activation of a previously unidentified Nox1-PKA-CREB/Ref-1 signaling pathway in pulmonary endothelial cells leads to Gremlin1 transactivation, proliferation and migration. These findings reveal a new signaling pathway by which Nox1 via induction of CREB and Gremlin1 signaling contributes to vascular remodeling and provide preclinical indication of its significance in PAH.",

HIF-P4H-2-deficient and wild-type (WT) mice or HIF-P4H inhibitor-treated WT mice were subjected to an ethanol diet for 3\u20134 weeks and their metabolic health, liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) were analyzed. Primary hepatocytes from the mice were used to study cellular ethanol metabolism. The HIF-P4H-2-deficient mice retained a healthier metabolic profile, including less adiposity, better lipoprotein profile and restored insulin sensitivity, while on the ethanol diet than the WT. They also demonstrated protection from alcohol-induced steatosis and liver damage and had less WAT inflammation. In liver and WAT the expression of the key lipogenic and adipocytokine mRNAs, such as Fas and Ccl2, were downregulated, respectively. The upregulation of metabolic and antioxidant hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) target genes, such as Slcs 16a1 and 16a3 and Gclc, respectively, and a higher catalytic activity of ALDH2 in the HIF-P4H-2-deficient hepatocytes improved handling of the toxic ethanol metabolites and oxidative stress.

This study aims to investigate the protection of EPI against monocrotaline (MCT)-induced HSOS and its engaged mechanism. Results of serum alanine/aspartate aminotransferases (ALT/AST) activities, total bilirubin (TBil) and bile acids (TBA) amounts, liver histological evaluation, scanning electron microscope observation and hepatic metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression all demonstrated the protection by EPI against MCT-induced HSOS in rats. EPI attenuated liver oxidative injury induced by MCT. EPI enhanced the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and increased the expression of its downstream antioxidant genes in rats. Molecular docking results implied the potential interaction of EPI with the Nrf2 binding site in kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (Keap1). The EPI-provided protection against MCT-induced HSOS was diminished in Nrf2 knock-out mice when mice were treated with MCT for 24\u202fh but not for 48\u202fh. However, EPI reduced the increased liver myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, hepatic infiltration of immune cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines expression and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB) activation in both wild-type and Nrf2 knock-out mice when mice were treated with MCT for 48\u202fh. EPI reduced the elevated serum heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) content, and reversed the decreased mitochondria expression of HSP60 and Lon in livers from MCT-treated rats. Furthermore, the MCT-induced HSOS was markedly alleviated in mice treated with anti-HSP60 antibody. Taken together, this study demonstrates that EPI attenuates MCT-induced HSOS by reducing liver oxidative injury via activating Nrf2 antioxidant pathway and inhibiting liver inflammatory injury through abrogating NF\u03baB signaling pathway initiated by HSP60.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria damage plays a critical role in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced necrosis and liver injury. Cells can adapt and protect themselves by removing damaged mitochondria via mitophagy. PINK1-Parkin pathway is one of the major pathways that regulate mitophagy but its role in APAP-induced liver injury is still elusive. We investigated the role of PINK1-Parkin pathway in hepatocyte mitophagy in APAP-induced liver injury in mice. Wild-type (WT), PINK1 knockout (KO), Parkin KO, and PINK1 and Parkin double KO (DKO) mice were treated with APAP for different time points. Liver injury was determined by measuring serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity, H&E staining as well as TUNEL staining of liver tissues. Tandem fluorescent-tagged inner mitochondrial membrane protein Cox8 (Cox8-GFP-mCherry) can be used to monitor mitophagy based on different pH stability of GFP and mCherry fluorescent proteins. We overexpressed Cox8-GFP-mCherry in mouse livers via tail vein injection of an adenovirus Cox8-GFP-mCherry. Mitophagy was assessed by confocal microscopy for Cox8-GFP-mCherry puncta, electron microscopy (EM) analysis for mitophagosomes and western blot analysis for mitochondrial proteins. Parkin KO and PINK1 KO mice improved the survival after treatment with APAP although the serum levels of ALT were not significantly different among PINK1 KO, Parkin KO and WT mice. We only found mild defects of mitophagy in PINK1 KO or Parkin KO mice after APAP, and improved survival in PINK1 KO and Parkin KO mice could be due to other functions of PINK1 and Parkin independent of mitophagy. In contrast, APAP-induced mitophagy was significantly impaired in PINK1-Parkin DKO mice. PINK1-Parkin DKO mice had further elevated serum levels of ALT and increased mortality after APAP administration. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that PINK1-Parkin signaling pathway plays a critical role in APAP-induced mitophagy and liver injury.",

Remarkably, plasma PDI levels could discriminate between distinct plasma proteome signatures, with PDI-rich (>median) plasma differentially expressing proteins related to cell differentiation, protein processing, housekeeping functions and others, while PDI-poor plasma differentially displayed proteins associated with coagulation, inflammatory responses and immunoactivation. Platelet function was similar among individuals with PDI-rich vs. PDI-poor plasma. Remarkably, such protein signatures closely correlated with endothelial function and phenotype, since cultured endothelial cells incubated with PDI-poor or PDI-rich plasma recapitulated gene expression and secretome patterns in line with their corresponding plasma signatures. Furthermore, such signatures translated into functional responses, with PDI-poor plasma promoting impairment of endothelial adhesion to fibronectin and a disturbed pattern of wound-associated migration and recovery area.

Emerging evidence indicates that cytoprotective antioxidation is involved in drug resistance of various cancers; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. Here, we demonstrated that atypical protein kinase C\u03b9 (aPKC\u03b9) mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibition in a kinase-independent manner, which played a crucial role in tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Mechanistically, we found that aPKC\u03b9 facilitated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) accumulation, nuclear translocation and activated its target genes by competing with Nrf2 for binding to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) through a highly conserved DLL motif. In addition, the aPKC\u03b9-Keap1 interaction was required for antioxidant effect, cell growth and gemcitabine resistance in GBC. Importantly, we further confirmed that aPKC\u03b9 was frequently upregulated and correlated with poor prognosis in patients with GBC. Collectively, our findings suggested that aPKC\u03b9 positively modulated the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway to enhance GBC growth and gemcitabine resistance, implying that the aPKC\u03b9-Keap1-Nrf2 axis may be a potential approach to overcome the drug resistance for the treatment of GBC.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria have originated in eukaryotic cells by endosymbiosis of a specialized prokaryote approximately 2 billion years ago. They are essential for normal cell function by providing energy through their role in oxidizing carbon substrates. Glutathione (GSH) is a major thiol-disulfide redox buffer of the cell including the mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space. We have generated cardiomyocyte-specific Grx1-roGFP2 GSH redox potential (EGSH) biosensor mice in the past, in which the sensor is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Using this mouse model a distinct EGSH of the mitochondrial matrix (\u2212278.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4\u202fmV) in isolated cardiomyocytes is observed. When analyzing the EGSH in isolated mitochondria from the transgenic hearts, however, the EGSH in the mitochondrial matrix is significantly oxidized (\u2212247.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.7\u202fmV). This is prevented by adding N-Ethylmaleimide during the mitochondria isolation procedure, which precludes disulfide bond formation. A similar reducing effect is observed by isolating mitochondria in hypoxic (0.1\u20133% O2) conditions that mimics mitochondrial pO2 levels in cellulo. The reduced EGSH is accompanied by lower ROS production, reduced complex III activity but increased ATP levels produced at baseline and after stimulation with succinate/ADP. Altogether, we demonstrate that oxygenation is an essential factor that needs to be considered when analyzing mitochondrial function ex vivo.",

     "abstract": "Macrophages adopt different phenotypes in response to microenvironmental changes, which can be principally classified into inflammatory and anti-inflammatory states. Inflammatory activation of macrophages has been linked with metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. In contrast to mouse macrophages, little information is available on the link between metabolism and inflammation in human macrophages. In the current report it is demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) fail to undergo metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis, but rely on oxidative phosphorylation for the generation of ATP. By contrast, activation by LPS led to an increased extracellular acidification rate (glycolysis) and decreased oxygen consumption rate (oxidative phosphorylation) in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDMs). Mitochondrial bioenergetics after LPS stimulation in human macrophages was unchanged, but was markedly impaired in mouse macrophages. Furthermore, treatment with 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, led to cell death in mouse, but not in human macrophages. Finally, glycolysis appeared to be critical for LPS-mediated induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 in both human and mouse macrophages. In summary, these findings indicate that LPS-induced immunometabolism in human macrophages is different to that observed in mouse macrophages.",

VPO1 is a heme enzyme that uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to produce hypochlorous acid (HOCl). Our previous study has demonstrated that VPO1 regulates myocardial ischemic reperfusion and renal fibrosis. We investigated the role of VPO1 in cardiac fibrosis after MI. The results showed that VPO1 expression was robustly upregulated in the failing human heart with ischemic cardiomyopathy and in a murine model of MI accompanied by severe cardiac fibrosis. Most importantly, knockdown of VPO1 by tail vein injection of VPO1 siRNA significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function and survival rate. In VPO1 knockdown mouse model and cardiac fibroblasts cultured with TGF-\u03b21, VPO1 contributes to cardiac fibroblasts differentiation, migration, collagen I synthesis and proliferation. Mechanistically, the fibrotic effects following MI of VPO1 manifested partially through HOCl formation to activate Smad2/3 and ERK1/2. Thus, we conclude that VPO1 is a crucial regulator of cardiac fibrosis after MI by mediating HOCl/Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, implying a promising therapeutic target in ischemic cardiomyopathy.",

Knowledge of their role in inflammation is limited, however. We postulated that TNF\u03b1-induced endothelial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and pro-inflammatory signaling would be ameliorated by targeting Nox2. Herein, we in silico-modelled two first-in-class Nox2 inhibitors developed in our laboratory, explored their cellular mechanism of action and tested their efficacy in in vitro and mouse in vivo models of inflammation. Our data show that these inhibitors (CPP11G and CPP11H) disrupted canonical Nox2 organizing factor, p47phox, translocation to Nox2 in the plasma membrane; and abolished ROS production, markedly attenuated stress-responsive MAPK signaling and downstream AP-1 and NF\u03baB nuclear translocation in human cells. Consequently, cell adhesion molecule expression and monocyte adherence were significantly inhibited by both inhibitors. In vivo, TNF\u03b1-induced ROS and inflammation were ameliorated by targeted Nox2 inhibition, which, in turn, improved hind-limb blood flow. These studies identify a proximal role for Nox2 in propagated inflammatory signaling and support therapeutic value of Nox2 inhibitors in inflammatory disease.",

We studied the role of tripartite motif 69 (TRIM69) in cataract formation. The expression of TRIM69 protein was down-regulated in both human cataract capsule tissues and HLECs treated with UVB, whereas the expression of p53 protein exhibited an opposite trend. Ectopic expression of TRIM69 in HLECs significantly suppressed UVB-induced apoptosis and ROS production, whereas knockdown of TRIM69 promoted apoptosis and ROS production. TRIM69 can interact with p53 and induce its ubiquitination. The effects of TRIM69 overexpression in UVB-induced cell apoptosis and ROS production was clearly weakened by p53 overexpression, thus suggesting a role for p53 in TRIM69 functions. Furthermore, inhibition of ROS mitigated the effects of UVB irradiation on ROS production, cell apoptosis, forkhead box protein 3a (Foxo3a) phosphorylation, and TRIM69 expression. Additionally, Foxo3a overexpression significantly enhanced TRIM69 promoter activity, whereas Foxo3a knockdown had the opposite effect. In conclusion, we provide the first demonstration that Foxo3a is a potential transcription factor for TRIM69, and TRIM69 induces p53 ubiquitination.

We determined mGSH status and indices of mitochondrial bioenergetics in hepatocytes from young and old F344 rats treated with 300\u202f\u03bcM menadione, a concentration that causes 50% cell death in old. At this concentration, mGSH was significantly lost only in hepatocytes from old rats, and with near total depletion due to lower basal mGSH in aged cells. In old hepatocytes, menadione caused mitochondrial membrane potential to collapse, as well as significant deficits in maximal O2 consumption and respiratory reserve capacity, indicators of cellular bioenergetic resiliency. Further examination revealed that the menadione-mediated loss of respiratory reserve capacity in aged hepatocytes was from significant inhibition of Complex I activity and increased proton leak, for which an increase in Complex II activity was not able to compensate. These data demonstrate an age-related increase in mitochondrial susceptibility to a redox-cycling challenge, particularly in regards to Complex I activity, and provide a plausible mechanism to link this vulnerability to mGSH perturbations.",

In vitro co-culture experiments with endothelial cells supported a regulatory role of the endothelium in damage-responsive cell behavior. Accordingly, in vivo genetic decrease of ROS levels in adult heart disengaged Bmi1+ cells from the cardiovascular network, recapitulating an adolescent-like Bmi1 expression profile.

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a highly metastatic tumor with an extremely low 5-year survival rate. Lack of efficient diagnostics and dearth of effective therapeutics that can target the cancer as well as the microenvironment niche are the reasons for limited success in treatment and management of this disease. Cell invasion through extracellular matrix (ECM) involves the complex regulation of adhesion to and detachment from ECM and its understanding is critical to metastatic potential of pancreatic cancer. To understand the characteristics of these cancer cells and their ability to metastasize, we compared human pancreatic cancer cell line, PANC-1 and its invading phenotype (INV) collected from transwell inserts. The invasive cell type, INV, exhibited higher resistance to Carbon-ion radiation compared to whole cultured (normally dish-cultured) PANC-1 (WCC), and had more efficient in vitro spheroid formation capability. Invasiveness of INV was hampered by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors, suggesting that nitric oxide (NO) plays a cardinal role in PANC-1 invasion. In addition, in vitro studies indicated that a MEK-ERK-dependent, JAK independent mechanism through which NOS/NO modulate PANC-1 invasiveness. Suspended INV showed enhanced NO production as well as induction of several pro-metastatic, and stemness-related genes. NOS inhibitor, l-NAME, reduced the expression of these pro-metastatic or stemness-related genes, and dampened spheroid formation ability, suggesting that NO can potentially influence pancreatic cancer aggressiveness. Furthermore, xenograft studies with INV and WCC in NSG mouse model revealed a greater ability of INV compared to WCC, to metastasize to the liver and l-NAME diminished the metastatic lesions in mice injected with INV. Overall, data suggest that NO is a key player associated with resistance to radiation and metastasis of pancreatic cancer; and inhibition of NOS demonstrates therapeutic potential as observed in the animal model by specifically targeting the metastatic cells that harbor stem-like features and are potentially responsible for relapse.",

A growing body of research data strongly suggests that imbalanced ROS and electrophile overproduction are among the major prodromal factors in the onset and progression of several cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and aging (Ma and He, 2012; Ramsey et al., 2017; Salminen et al., 2012; Sandberg et al., 2014; Sarlette et al., 2008; Tanji et al., 2013) [1\u20136]. Cells offset oxidative stress by the action of housekeeping antioxidative enzymes (such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase) as well direct and indirect antioxidants (Dinkova-Kostova and Talalay, 2010) [7]. The DNA sequence responsible for modulating the antioxidative and cytoprotective responses of the cells has been identified as the antioxidant response element (ARE), while the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (NRF2) is the major regulator of the xenobiotic-activated receptor (XAR) responsible for activating the ARE-pathway, thus defined as the NRF2-ARE system (Ma and He, 2012) [1]. In addition, the interplay between the NRF2-ARE system and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u0138B, a protein complex that controls cytokine production and cell survival), has been further investigated in relation to neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory disorders. On these premises, we provide a review analysis of current understanding of the NRF2-NF-\u0138B interplay, their specific role in major CNS disorders, and consequent therapeutic implication for the treatment of neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases.",

     "abstract": "Hemolytic diseases are associated with elevated levels of circulating free heme that can mediate endothelial dysfunction directly via redox reactions with biomolecules or indirectly by upregulating enzymatic sources of reactive species. A key enzymatic source of these reactive species is the purine catabolizing enzyme, xanthine oxidase (XO) as the oxidation of hypoxanthine to xanthine and subsequent oxidation of xanthine to uric acid generates superoxide (O2\u2022-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). While XO has been studied for over 120 years, much remains unknown regarding specific mechanistic roles for this enzyme in pathologic processes. This gap in knowledge stems from several interrelated issues including: 1) lethality of global XO deletion and the absence of tissue-specific XO knockout models have coalesced to relegate proof-of-principle experimentation to pharmacology; 2) XO is mobile and thus when upregulated locally can be secreted into the circulation and impact distal vascular beds by high-affinity association to the glycocalyx on the endothelium; and 3) endothelial-bound XO is significantly resistant (>\u202f50%) to inhibition by allopurinol, the principle compound used for XO inhibition in the clinic as well as the laboratory. While it is known that circulating XO is elevated in hemolytic diseases including sickle cell, malaria and sepsis, little is understood regarding its role in these pathologies. As such, the aim of this review is to define our current understanding regarding the effect of hemolysis (free heme) on circulating XO levels as well as the subsequent impact of XO-derived oxidants in hemolytic disease processes.",

     "abstract": "Transcription factors control the rate of transcription of genetic information from DNA to messenger RNA, by binding specific DNA sequences in promoter regions. Transcriptional gene control is a rate-limiting process that is tightly regulated and based on transient environmental signals which are translated into long-term changes in gene transcription. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) on transcription factors by phosphorylation or acetylation have profound effects not only on sub-cellular localization but also on substrate specificity through changes in DNA binding capacity. During times of cellular stress, specific transcription factors are in place to help protect the cell from damage by initiating the transcription of antioxidant response genes. Here we discuss PTMs caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2, that can expeditiously regulate the activation of transcription factors involved in the oxidative stress response. Part of this rapid regulation are proteins involved in H2O2-related reduction and oxidation (redox) reactions such as redoxins, H2O2 scavengers described to interact with transcription factors. Redoxins have highly reactive cysteines of rate constants around 6\u201310\u22121 s\u22121 that engage in nucleophilic substitution of a thiol-disulfide with another thiol in inter-disulfide exchange reactions. We propose here that H2O2 signal transduction induced inter-disulfide exchange reactions between redoxin cysteines and cysteine thiols of transcription factors to allow for rapid and precise on and off switching of transcription factor activity. Thus, redoxins are essential modulators of stress response pathways beyond H2O2 scavenging capacity.",

Here we investigated the effects of systemic and SMC-specific deletion of Noxa1 on VSMC phenotype during atherogenesis in mice.Neointimal hyperplasia following endovascular injury was lower in Noxa1-deficient mice versus the wild-type following endovascular injury. Noxa1 deletion in Apoe-/- or Ldlr-/- mice fed a Western diet showed 50% reduction in vascular ROS and 30% reduction in aortic atherosclerotic lesion area and aortic sinus lesion volume (P\u202f<\u202f0.01).

TNF\u03b1-induced ROS generation, proliferation and migration were significantly attenuated in Noxa1-deficient versus wild-type VSMC. Immunofluorescence analysis of atherosclerotic lesions showed a significant decrease in cells positive for CD68 and myosin11 (22% versus 9%) and Mac3 and \u03b1-actin (17% versus 5%) in the Noxa1SMC-/-/Apoe-/- versus Apoe-/- mice.

     "abstract": "Cells evolved robust homeostatic mechanisms to protect against oxidation or alkylation by electrophilic species. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant intracellular thiol, protects cellular components from oxidation and is maintained in a reduced state by glutathione reductase (GR). Nitro oleic acid (NO2-OA) is an electrophilic fatty acid formed under digestive and inflammatory conditions that both reacts with GSH and induces its synthesis upon activation of Nrf2 signaling. The effects of NO2-OA on intracellular GSH homeostasis were evaluated. In addition to upregulation of GSH biosynthesis, we observed that NO2-OA increased intracellular GSSG in an oxidative stress-independent manner. NO2-OA directly inhibited GR in vitro by covalent modification of the catalytic Cys61, with kon of (3.45 \u00b1 0.04)\u202f\u00d7\u202f103 M\u22121 s\u22121, koff of (4.4 \u00b1 0.4)\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22124 s\u22121, and\u00a0Keq of (1.3 \u00b1 0.1)\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22127 M. Akin to NO2-OA, the electrophilic Nrf2 activators bardoxolone-imidazole (CDDO-Im), bardoxolone-methyl (CDDO-Me) and dimethyl fumarate (DMF) also upregulated GSH biosynthesis while promoting GSSG accumulation, but without directly inhibiting GR activity. In vitro assays in which GR was treated with increasing GSH concentrations and GSH depletion experiments in cells revealed that GR activity is finely regulated via product inhibition, an observation further supported by theoretical (kinetic modeling of cellular GSSG:GSH levels) approaches. Together, these results describe two independent mechanisms by which electrophiles modulate the GSH/GSSG couple, and provide a novel conceptual framework to interpret experimentally determined values of GSH and GSSG.",

However, the relative contributions of Sod1 to protection against oxidative stress and redox signaling are poorly understood. Using the model unicellular eukaryote, Baker's yeast, we found that only a small fraction of the total Sod1 pool is required for protection against superoxide toxicity and that this pool is localized to the mitochondrial intermembrane space. On the contrary, we find that much larger amounts of extra-mitochondrial Sod1 are critical for peroxide-mediated redox signaling. Altogether, our results force the re-evaluation of the physiological role of bulk Sod1 in redox biology; namely, we propose that the vast majority of Sod1 in yeast is utilized for peroxide-mediated signaling rather than superoxide scavenging.",

The hepatocarcinoma-derived HepG2 cell line under both normal and oxidative/nitrosative conditions by overexpression of NO synthase (NOS3) was used as experimental model. Grx1 or Trx1 silencing caused conspicuous changes in the redox proteome reflected by significant changes in the reduced/oxidized ratios of specific Cys's including several glycolytic enzymes. Cys91 of peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6) and Cys153 of phosphoglycerate mutase-1 (PGAM1), that are known to be involved in progression of tumor growth, are reported here for the first time as specific targets of Grx1. A group of proteins increased their CysRED/CysOX ratio upon Trx1 and/or Grx1 silencing, including caspase-3 Cys163, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) Cys247 and triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI) Cys255 likely by enhancement of NOS3 auto-oxidation. The activities of several glycolytic enzymes were also significantly affected. Glycolysis metabolic flux increased upon Trx1 silencing, whereas silencing of Grx1 had the opposite effect. Diversion of metabolic fluxes toward synthesis of fatty acids and phospholipids was observed in siRNA-Grx1 treated cells, while siRNA-Trx1 treated cells showed elevated levels of various sphingomyelins and ceramides and signs of increased protein degradation. Glutathione synthesis was stimulated by both treatments. These data indicate that Trx and Grx have both, common and specific protein Cys redox targets and that down regulation of either redoxin has markedly different metabolic outcomes. They reflect the delicate sensitivity of redox equilibrium to changes in any of the elements involved and the difficulty of forecasting metabolic responses to redox environmental changes.",

The anticancer effects of L-ASC involve its autoxidation and generation of H2O2, which is selectively toxic to malignant cells. Here we present that thioredoxin antioxidant system plays a key role in the scavenging of extracellularly-generated H2O2 in malignant B-cells. We show that inhibition of peroxiredoxin 1, the enzyme that removes H2O2 in a thioredoxin system-dependent manner, increases the sensitivity of malignant B-cells to L-ASC. Moreover, we demonstrate that auranofin (AUR), the inhibitor of the thioredoxin system that is used as an antirheumatic drug, diminishes the H2O2-scavenging capacity of malignant B-cells and potentiates pharmacological ascorbate anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. The addition of AUR to L-ASC-treated cells triggers the accumulation of H2O2 in the cells, which results in iron-dependent cytotoxicity. Importantly, the synergistic effects are observed at as low as 200\u202f\u00b5M\u202fL-ASC concentrations. In conclusion, we observed strong, synergistic, cancer-selective interaction between L-ASC and auranofin.

We previously developed a curcumin analog B63 as an anti-cancer agent in pre-clinical evaluation. In the present study, we evaluated the effect and mechanism of B63 on gastric cancer cells. Our studies show that B63 targets TrxR1 protein and increases cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, which results in halting gastric cancer cells and inducing caspase-independent paraptotic modes of death.

     "abstract": "Dysregulation of cholesterol metabolism represents one of the major risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Oxidized cholesterol esters (oxCE) in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) have been implicated in CVD but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly defined. We use a targeted lipidomic approach to demonstrate that levels of oxCEs in human plasma are associated with different types of CVD and significantly elevated in patients with myocardial infarction. We synthesized a major endogenous cholesterol ester hydroperoxide (CEOOH), cholesteryl-13(cis, trans)-hydroperoxy-octadecadienoate (ch-13(c,t)-HpODE) and show that this endogenous compound significantly increases plasma cholesterol level in mice while decrease cholesterol levels in mouse liver and peritoneal macrophages, which is primarily due to the inhibition of cholesterol uptake in macrophages and liver. Further studies indicate that inhibition of cholesterol uptake by ch-13(c,t)-HpODE in macrophages is dependent on LXR\u03b1-IDOL-LDLR pathway, whereas inhibition on cholesterol levels in hepatocytes is dependent on LXR\u03b1 and LDLR. Consistently, these effects on cholesterol levels by ch-13(c,t)-HpODE are diminished in LDLR or LXR\u03b1 knockout mice. Together, our study provides evidence that elevated plasma cholesterol levels by CEOOHs are primarily due to the inhibition of cholesterol uptake in the liver and macrophages, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CVD.",

We investigated the signal transduction pathway and epigenetic regulatory mechanisms underlying cellular inflammation induced by PM with a diameter of \u2264\u202f2.5 (PM2.5) in vitro and in vivo. PM2.5-treated skin keratinocytes produced various inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6. The binding of PM2.5 to TLR5 initiated intracellular signaling through MyD88, and led to the translocation of NF\u03baB to the nucleus, where it bound the NF\u03baB site within IL-6 promoter. Furthermore, PM2.5 induced a direct interaction between TLR5 and NOX4, and in turn induced the production of ROS and activated NF\u03baB-IL-6 downstream, which was prevented by siRNA-mediated knockdown of NOX4 or antioxidant treatment. Furthermore, expression of TLR5, MyD88, NOX4, phospho-NF\u03baB, and IL-6 was increased in skin tissue of PM2.5-treated flaky tail mice. PM2.5-induced increased transcription of IL-6 was regulated via DNA methylation and histone methylation by epigenetic modification; the binding of DNA demethylase and histone methyltransferase to the IL-6 promoter regions resulted in increased IL-6 mRNA expression. Our findings provide deep insight into the pathogenesis of PM2.5 exposure and can be used as a therapeutic strategy to treat inflammatory skin diseases caused by PM2.5 exposure.",

In this study, we employed RNA nanotechnology for specific delivery of D5D-siRNA to xenograft colon tumors using 3WJ RNA nanoparticles. When a targeting module, i.e., the EpCAM aptamer, was incorporated, the 3WJ pRNA nanoparticles were able specifically deliver D5D siRNA to human colon cancer HCA-7 cells both in vitro and in vivo, resulting in significant downregulation of D5D expression. Co-treatment with DGLA in combination with 3WJ-EpCAM-siRNA induced a higher DGLA/AA ratio and enhanced formation of 8-HOA at a threshold level, and in HCA-7 tumor-bearing mice, induced significant tumor suppression. We further confirmed that 8-HOA formation, promoted by COX-2-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation, inhibited HDAC and consequently induced apoptosis in tumor cells. Therefore, the 3WJ RNA nanoparticle system holds great promise as a suitable therapeutic delivery platform for colon cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Genes that are highly conserved in food seeking behaviour, such as protein kinase G (PKG), are of interest because of their potential role in the global obesity epidemic. PKG1\u03b1 can be activated by binding of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) or oxidant-induced interprotein disulfide bond formation between the two subunits of this homodimeric kinase. PKG1\u03b1 activation by cGMP plays a role in reward and addiction through its actions in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the brain. \u2018Redox dead\u2019 C42S PKG1\u03b1 knock-in (KI) mice, which are fully deficient in oxidant-induced disulfide-PKG1\u03b1 formation, display increased food seeking and reward behaviour compared to wild-type (WT) littermates. Rewarding monoamines such as dopamine, which are released during feeding, are metabolised by monoamine oxidase to generate hydrogen peroxide that was shown to mediate PKG1\u03b1 oxidation. Indeed, inhibition of monoamine oxidase, which prevents it producing hydrogen peroxide, attenuated PKG1\u03b1 oxidation and increased sucrose preference in WT, but not KI mice. The deficient reward phenotype of the KI mice was rescued by expressing WT kinase that can form the disulfide state in the VTA using an adeno-associated virus, consistent with PKG1\u03b1 oxidation providing a break on feeding behaviour. In conclusion, disulfide-PKG1\u03b1 in VTA neurons acts as a negative regulator of feeding and therefore may provide a novel therapeutic target for obesity.",

     "abstract": "Members of the evolutionary conserved Sco protein family have been intensively studied regarding their role in the assembly of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase. However, experimental and structural data, specifically the presence of a thioredoxin-like fold, suggest that Sco proteins may also play a role in redox homeostasis.In our study, we addressed this putative function of Sco proteins using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. Like many eukaryotes, this yeast possesses two SCO homologs (SCO1 and SCO2). Mutants bearing a deletion of either of the two genes are not affected in their growth under oxidative stress. However, the concomitant deletion of the SOD1 gene encoding the superoxide dismutase 1 resulted in a distinct phenotype: double deletion strains lacking SCO1 or SCO2 and SOD1 are highly sensitive to oxidative stress and show dramatically increased ROS levels.The respiratory competent double deletion strain \u0394sco2\u0394sod1 paved the way to investigate the putative antioxidant function of SCO homologs apart from their role in respiration by complementation analysis. Sco homologs from Drosophila, Arabidopsis, human and two other yeast species were integrated into the genome of the double deletion mutant and the transformants were analyzed for their growth under oxidative stress. Interestingly, all homologs except for Kluyveromyces lactis K07152 and Arabidopsis thaliana HCC1 were able to complement the phenotype, indicating their role in oxidative stress defense. We further applied this complementation-based system to investigate whether pathogenic point mutations affect the putative antioxidant role of hSco2. Surprisingly, all of the mutant alleles failed to restore the ROS-sensitivity of the \u0394sco2\u0394sod1 strain.In conclusion, our data not only provide clear evidence for the function of Sco proteins in oxidative stress defense but also offer a valuable tool to investigate this role for other homologous proteins.",

     "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common chronic diseases in the United States and peripheral neuropathy (PN) affects at least 50% of diabetic patients. Medications available for patients ameliorate symptoms (pain), but do not protect against cellular damage and come with severe side effects, leading to discontinued use. Our research group uses differentiated SH-SY5Y cells treated with advanced glycation end products (AGE) as a model to mimic diabetic conditions and to study the mechanisms of oxidative stress mediated cell damage and antioxidant protection. N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a common antioxidant supplement, was previously shown by our group to fully protect against AGE-induced damage. We have also shown that 3H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione (D3T), a cruciferous vegetable constituent and potent inducer of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)- like 2 (Nrf2), can significantly increase cellular GSH concentrations and protect against oxidant species\u2013induced cell death. Paradoxically, D3T conferred no protection against AGE-induced cell death or neurite degeneration. In the present study we establish a mechanism for this paradox by showing that D3T in combination with AGE increased oxidant species generation and depleted GSH via inhibition of glutathione reductase (GR) activity and increased expression of the NADPH generating enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). Blocking NADPH generation with the G6PD inhibitor dehydroepiandrosterone was found to protect against AGE-induced oxidant species generation, loss of viability, and neurite degeneration. It further reversed the D3T potentiation effect under AGE-treated conditions. Collectively, these results suggest that strategies aimed at combating oxidative stress that rely on upregulation of the endogenous antioxidant defense system via Nrf2 may backfire and promote further damage in diabetic PN.",

     "abstract": "Brain iron accumulation is common in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Iron chelators have been investigated for their ability to prevent neurodegenerative diseases with features of iron overload. Given the non-trivial side effects of classical iron chelators, lactoferrin (Lf), a multifunctional iron-binding globular glycoprotein, was screened to identify novel neuroprotective pathways against dopaminergic neuronal impairment. We found that Lf substantially ameliorated PD-like motor dysfunction in the subacute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. We further showed that Lf could alleviate MPTP-triggered apoptosis of DA neurons, neuroinflammation, and histological alterations. As expected, we also found that Lf suppressed MPTP-induced excessive iron accumulation and the upregulation of divalent metal transporter (DMT1) and transferrin receptor (TFR), which is the main intracellular iron regulation protein, and subsequently improved the activity of several antioxidant enzymes. We probed further and determined that the neuroprotection provided by Lf was involved in the upregulated levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) and its downstream protein, accompanied by the activation of extracellular regulated protein kinases (ERK) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), as well as decreased phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)/P38 kinase in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that Lf may be an alternative safe drug in ameliorating MPTP-induced brain abnormalities and movement disorder.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent age-associated dementia with no treatments that can prevent or slow its progression. Since age is by far the major risk factor for AD, there is a strong rationale for an alternative approach to drug discovery based upon the biology of aging. Phenotypic screening assays that reflect multiple, age-associated neurotoxicity pathways rather than single molecular targets can identify compounds that have therapeutic efficacy by targeting aspects of aging that contribute to AD pathology. And, while the suitability of any single assay can be questioned, a combination of assays can make reliable predictions about the neuroprotective effects of compounds in vivo. Therefore, our lab has developed a combination of phenotypic screening assays that are ideally suited not only to identify novel neuroprotective compounds for the treatment of AD but also their target pathways, thereby potentially providing new therapeutic targets for disease treatment. Using these assays, we screened a large library of extracts from plants with identified pharmacological uses. Analysis of one of these extracts from the plant Yerba santa (Eriodictyon californicum) identified the flavanone sterubin as the active component and further studies showed it to be a potent neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory compound.",

     "abstract": "The physiological importance of reactive sulfur species (RSS) such as cysteine hydropersulfide (CysSSH) has been increasingly recognized in recent years. We have established a reactive sulfur metabolomics analysis by using RSS metabolic profiling, which revealed appreciable amounts of RSS generated endogenously and ubiquitously in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. The chemical nature of these polysulfides is not fully understood, however, because of their reactive or complicated redox-active properties. In our study here, we determined that tyrosine and a hydroxyphenyl-containing derivative, \u03b2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethyl iodoacetamide (HPE-IAM), had potent stabilizing effects on diverse polysulfide residues formed in CysSSH-related low-molecular-weight species, e.g., glutathione polysulfides (oxidized glutathione trisulfide and oxidized glutathione tetrasulfide). The protective effect against degradation was likely caused by the inhibitory activity of hydroxyphenyl residues of tyrosine and HPE-IAM against alkaline hydrolysis of polysulfides. This hydrolysis occurred via heterolytic scission triggered by the hydroxyl anion acting on polysulfides that are cleaved into thiolates and sulfenic acids, with the hydrolysis being enhanced by alkylating reagents (e.g. IAM) and dimedone. Moreover, tyrosine prevented electrophilic degradation occurring in alkaline pH. The polysulfide stabilization induced by tyrosine or the hydroxyphenyl moiety of HPE-IAM will greatly improve our understanding of the chemical properties of polysulfides and may benefit the sulfur metabolomics analysis if it can be applied successfully to any kind of biological samples, including clinical specimens.",

However, whether this peptide affects nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has remained unclear. In this study, the serum adropin levels, liver injury and oxidative stress were measured in diet-induced NASH mice. Adropin knock-out mice and palmitate treated primary hepatic cells were used to investigate the influence of adropin on liver injury. Our results show that serum adropin levels were decreased and negatively correlated with liver injury in NASH mice. Knockout of adropin significantly exacerbated hepatic steatosis, inflammatory responses and fibrosis in mice after either methionine-choline deficient diet (MCD) or western diet (WD) feeding. And the treatment with adropin bioactive peptides ameliorated NASH progression in mice. Adropin alleviated hepatocyte injury by upregulating the expression of Gclc, Gclm, and Gpx1 in a manner dependent on Nrf2 transcriptional activity and by increasing the glutathione (GSH) levels. And adropin significantly increased CBP expression and promoted its binding with Nrf2, which enhanced Nrf2 transcriptional activity. Furthermore, AAV8-mediated overexpression of hepatic Nrf2 expression functionally restored the liver injury induced by adropin-deficiency MCD-fed mice. These findings provide evidence that adropin activates Nrf2 signaling and plays a protective role in liver injury of NASH and therefore might represent a novel target for the prevention and treatment of NASH.",

Heat shock protein 22 (HSP22) is a stress-inducible protein associated with cytoprotection and apoptosis inhibition.

Here, we investigated whether HSP22 protects the vascular endothelium from hyperglycemia-induced injury by reducing mtROS production. We used a high-fat diet and streptozotocin injection model to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, metabolic syndrome) and exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to high glucose following overexpression or silencing of HSP22 to explore the role of HSP22. We found that HSP22 markedly inhibited endothelial cell activation and vascular lesions by inhibiting endothelial adhesion and decreasing cytokine secretion. We performed confocal microscopy and flow cytometry assays using HUVECs and showed that HSP22 attenuated mtROS and mitochondrial dysfunction in hyperglycemia-stimulated endothelial cells. Mechanistically, using the mtROS inhibitor MitoTEMPO, we demonstrated that HSP22 suppressed endothelial activation and injury by eliminating hyperglycemia-mediated increases in mtROS. Furthermore, we found that HSP22 maintained the balance of mitochondrial fusion and fission by mitigating mtROS in vitro. HSP22 attenuated the development of vascular lesions by suppressing mtROS-mediated endothelial activation in a T2DM mouse model. This study provides evidence that HSP22 may be a promising therapeutic target for vascular complications in T2DM.",

     "abstract": "Increasing evidence indicates that mitochondrial-associated redox signaling contributes to the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). The mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant, mitoquinone (MitoQ), is capable of modifying mitochondrial signaling and has shown beneficial effects on HF-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction. However, the potential therapeutic impact of MitoQ-based mitochondrial therapies for HF in response to pressure overload is reliant upon demonstration of improved cardiac contractile function and suppression of deleterious cardiac remodeling. Using a new (patho)physiologically relevant model of pressure overload-induced HF we tested the hypothesis that MitoQ is capable of ameliorating cardiac contractile dysfunction and suppressing fibrosis. To test this C57BL/6J mice were subjected to left ventricular (LV) pressure overload by ascending aortic constriction (AAC) followed by MitoQ treatment (2\u202f\u00b5mol) for 7 consecutive days. Doppler echocardiography showed that AAC caused severe LV dysfunction and hypertrophic remodeling. MitoQ attenuated pressure overload-induced apoptosis, hypertrophic remodeling, fibrosis and LV dysfunction. Profibrogenic transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4, a major modulator of fibrosis related redox signaling) expression increased markedly after AAC. MitoQ blunted TGF-\u03b21 and NOX4 upregulation and the downstream ACC-dependent fibrotic gene expressions. In addition, MitoQ prevented Nrf2 downregulation and activation of TGF-\u03b21-mediated profibrogenic signaling in cardiac fibroblasts (CF). Finally, MitoQ ameliorated the dysregulation of cardiac remodeling-associated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in AAC myocardium, phenylephrine-treated cardiomyocytes, and TGF-\u03b21-treated CF. The present study demonstrates for the first time that MitoQ improves cardiac hypertrophic remodeling, fibrosis, LV dysfunction and dysregulation of lncRNAs in pressure overload hearts, by inhibiting the interplay between TGF-\u03b21 and mitochondrial associated redox signaling.",

As an essential regulator of vascular homeostasis, KLF4 exerts a protective effect in endothelial cells (ECs), including regulating vasodilation, inflammation, coagulation and oxidative stress. However, the underlying mechanisms modifying KLF4 activity in mediating vascular function remain poorly understood. Recently, essential roles for S-nitrosation have been implicated in many pathophysiologic processes of cardiovascular disease. Here, we demonstrated that KLF4 could undergo S-nitrosation in response to nitrosative stress in ECs, leading to the decreased nuclear localization with compromised transactivity. Mass-spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that S-nitrosation modified KLF4 predominantly at Cys437. Functionally, KLF4 dependent vasodilatory response was impaired after S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) treatment. In ECs, endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced KLF4 S-nitrosation, which was inhibited by an endothelin receptor antagonist Bosentan. In hypoxia-induced rat model of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), S-nitrosated KLF4 (SNO-KLF4) was significantly increased in lung tissues, along with decreased nuclear localization of KLF4. In summary, we demonstrated that S-nitrosation is a novel mechanism for the post-translational modification of KLF4 in ECs. Moreover, these findings suggested that KLF4 S-nitrosation may be implicated in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction and diseases such as PAH.",

     "abstract": "Cadmium is a toxic pollutant that in recent decades has become more widespread in the environment due to anthropogenic activities, significantly increasing the risk of exposure. Concurrently, a continually growing body of research has begun to enumerate the harmful effects that this heavy metal has on human health. Consequently, additional research is required to better understand the mechanism and effects of cadmium at the molecular level. The main mechanism of cadmium toxicity is based on the indirect induction of severe oxidative stress, through several processes that unbalance the anti-oxidant cellular defence system, including the displacement of metals such as zinc from its native binding sites. Such mechanism was thought to alter the in vivo enzymatic activity of SOD1, one of the main antioxidant proteins of many tissues, including the central nervous system. SOD1 misfolding and aggregation is correlated with cytotoxicity in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We assessed the effect of cadmium on SOD1 folding and maturation pathway directly in human cells through in-cell NMR. Cadmium does not directly bind intracellular SOD1, instead causes the formation of its intramolecular disulfide bond in the zinc-bound form. Metallothionein overexpression is strongly induced by cadmium, reaching NMR-detectable levels. The intracellular availability of zinc modulates both SOD1 oxidation and metallothionein overexpression, strengthening the notion that zinc-loaded metallothioneins help maintaining the redox balance under cadmium-induced acute stress.",

On the protein level, a major target of these oxidants is the thiol group of the amino acid cysteine in proteins. Oxidation of thiol groups is a widespread regulatory post-translational protein modification. It is used by bacteria to respond to and to overcome oxidative stress. Numerous redox proteomic studies have shown that protein thiols in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli react towards a number of oxidants in specific ways. However, our knowledge about protein thiols in bacteria exposed to the complex mixture of oxidants encountered in the phagolysosome is still limited. In this study, we used a quantitative redox proteomic method (OxICAT) to assess the in vivo thiol oxidation status of phagocytized E. coli. The majority (65.5%) of identified proteins harbored thiols that were significantly oxidized (>\u202f30%) upon phagocytosis. A substantial number of these proteins are from major metabolic pathways or are involved in cell detoxification and stress response, suggesting a systemic breakdown of the bacterial cysteine proteome in phagocytized bacteria. 16 of the oxidized proteins provide E. coli with a significant growth advantage in the presence of H2O2, when compared to deletion mutants lacking these proteins, and 11 were shown to be essential under these conditions.",

To remove them, cells employ the proteasomal and autophagy-lysosomal systems; however, if the clearance rate is inferior to its formation, protein aggregates form as a hallmark of proteostasis loss. In cells, during stress conditions, actin aggregates accumulate leading to impaired proliferation and reduced proteasomal activity, as observed in cellular senescence. The heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a molecular chaperone that binds and protects the proteasome from oxidative inactivation. We hypothesized that in oxidative stress conditions a malfunction of Hsp90 occurs resulting in the aforementioned protein aggregates.Here, we demonstrate that upon oxidative stress Hsp90 loses its function in a highly specific non-enzymatic iron-catalyzed oxidation event and its breakdown product, a cleaved form of Hsp90 (Hsp90cl), acquires a new function in mediating the accumulation of actin aggregates. Moreover, the prevention of Hsp90 cleavage reduces oxidized actin accumulation, whereas transfection of the cleaved form of Hsp90 leads to an enhanced accumulation of oxidized actin.This indicates a clear role of the Hsp90cl in the aggregation of oxidized proteins.",

The astrocyte swelling resulted in GFAP tension increment, which is associated with the antagonistic effect of inward microfilaments (MFs) and microtubules (MTs) forces. In glutamate-induced astrocyte swelling, GFAP tension rise resulted from outward ion and protein nanoparticle-induced osmotic pressure (PN-OP) increases, where PN-OP could be elicited by MF and MT depolymerization, protein nanoparticle production, and activation of cofilin and stathmin-1. Attenuation of both ion osmotic pressure and PN-OP by drug combinations, together with free-radical scavenger, relieved cerebral edema in vivo. The study suggests that intracellular osmotic pressure (especially PN-OP) has a pivotal role in glutamate-induced astrocyte swelling and brain edema.

Macrophage stimulating 1 (Mst1) is a novel mitophagy upstream regulator which excerbates heart and cancer apoptosisn via repressing mitophagy activity. The aim of our study is to explore whether Mst1 contributes to NAFLD via disrupting Parkin-related mitophagy. A NAFLD model was generated in wild-type (WT) mice and Mst1 knockout (Mst1-KO) mice using high-fat diet (HFD). Cell experiments were conducted via palmitic acid (PA) treatment in the primary hepatocytes. The results in our study demonstrated that Mst1 was significantly upregulated in HFD-treated livers. Genetic ablation of Mst1 attenuated HFD-mediated hepatic injury and sustained hepatocyte viability. Functional studies illustrated that Mst1 knockdown reversed Parkin-related mitophagy and the latter protected mitochondria and hepatocytes against HFD challenge. Besides, we further figured out that Mst1 modulated Parkin expression via the AMPK pathway; blockade of AMPK repressed Parkin-related mitophagy and recalled hepatocytes mitochondrial apoptosis. Altogether, our data identified that NAFLD was closely associated with the defective Parkin-related mitophagy due to Mst1 upregulation.

Only a limited number of Nox-oxidized proteins have been identified thus far; especially little is known concerning redox-targets of the constitutively active NADPH oxidase Nox4.In this study, HEK293 cells with tetracycline-inducible Nox4 overexpression (HEK-tet-Nox4), as well as podocytes of WT and Nox4-/- mice, were utilized to identify Nox4-dependent redox-modified proteins.TGF\u03b21 induced an elevation in Nox4 expression in podocytes from WT but not Nox4-/- mice. Using BIAM based redox switch assay in combination with mass spectrometry and western blot analysis, 142 proteins were identified as differentially oxidized in podocytes from wild type vs. Nox4-/- mice and 131 proteins were differentially oxidized in HEK-tet-Nox4 cells upon Nox4 overexpression. A predominant overlap was found for peroxiredoxins and thioredoxins, as expected. More interestingly, the GRB2-associated-binding protein 1 (Gab1) was identified as being differentially oxidized in both approaches. Further analysis using mass spectrometry-coupled BIAM switch assay and site directed mutagenesis, revealed Cys374 and Cys405 as the major Nox4 targeted oxidation sites in Gab1.BIAM switch assay coupled to mass spectrometry is a powerful and versatile tool to identify differentially oxidized proteins in a global untargeted way. Nox4, as a source of hydrogen peroxide, changes the redox-state of numerous proteins. Of those, we identified Gab1 as a novel redox target of Nox4.",

The current study aims to investigate whether calcitriol, the active metabolite of vitamin D3, could protect cells against HS-induced inflammation through modulating this critical step.Human corneal epithelial cells (iHCECs) were cultured in hyperosmotic medium (450 mOsM) with various concentrations of calcitriol. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) was used to knock down the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in iHCECs. NLRP3 activation and IL-1\u03b2 generation were detected by RT-qPCR or ELISA, respectively. Oxidative stress markers including ROS and 8-OHdG were examined by fluorometric analysis. The nuclear translocation of NRF2 was assessed by western blotting.Calcitriol could protect cells against HS-induced injury through inhibiting ROS-NLRP3-IL-1\u03b2 signaling axis. Calcitriol remarkably suppressed the expression of NLRP3 inflammasome related genes and the production of IL-1\u03b2 in cells that were exposed to HS. It could also significantly attenuate HS-induced oxidative stress, shown as the reduced intracellular ROS generation and 8-OHdG staining cells after calcitriol treatment. Calcitriol induced the translocation of NRF2 to the nucleus, and thereby triggered the expression of several antioxidant enzymes.The current study indicated that calcitriol could inhibit the priming stage of HS-induced cellular inflammation, highlighting its potential capacity to prevent and mitigate dry eye related corneal inflammation at an earlier stage.",

We hypothesised that such measurements may provide useful insight into metabolic/redox regulation at the whole-body level and would be consistent between individuals exposed to identical challenges. An exploratory study was performed during the Xtreme Alps expedition in 2010 in which four healthy individuals (2 male, 2 female) underwent paired arterial and central venous blood sampling before, during and after performance of a constant-work-rate cardiopulmonary exercise test, at sea level and again at 4559\u202fm. Unexpectedly, plasma total free thiol and free cysteine concentrations remained substantially elevated at altitude throughout exercise with minimal arteriovenous gradients. Free sulfide concentrations changed only modestly upon combined altitude/exercise stress, whereas bound sulfide levels were lower at altitude than sea-level. No consistent signal indicative of the expected increased oxidative stress and nitrate\u2192nitrite\u2192NO reduction was observed with 4-hydroxynonenal, isoprostanes, nitrate, nitrite, nitroso species and cylic guanosine monophosphate.

     "abstract": "Low molecular weight (LMW) thiols play an important role as thiol-cofactors for many enzymes and are crucial to maintain the reduced state of the cytoplasm. Most Gram-negative bacteria utilize glutathione (GSH) as major LMW thiol. However, in Gram-positive Actinomycetes and Firmicutes alternative LMW thiols, such as mycothiol (MSH) and bacillithiol (BSH) play related roles as GSH surrogates, respectively. Under conditions of hypochlorite stress, MSH and BSH are known to form mixed disulfides with protein thiols, termed as S-mycothiolation or S-bacillithiolation that function in thiol-protection and redox regulation. Protein S-thiolations are widespread redox-modifications discovered in different Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus and Staphylococcus species, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Corynebacterium glutamicum and Corynebacterium diphtheriae. S-thiolated proteins are mainly involved in cellular metabolism, protein translation, redox regulation and antioxidant functions with some conserved targets across bacteria. The reduction of protein S-mycothiolations and S-bacillithiolations requires glutaredoxin-related mycoredoxin and bacilliredoxin pathways to regenerate protein functions.In this review, we present an overview of the functions of mycothiol and bacillithiol and their physiological roles in protein S-bacillithiolations and S-mycothiolations in Gram-positive bacteria. Significant progress has been made to characterize the role of protein S-thiolation in redox-regulation and thiol protection of main metabolic and antioxidant enzymes. However, the physiological roles of the pathways for regeneration are only beginning to emerge as well as their interactions with other cellular redox systems. Future studies should be also directed to explore the roles of protein S-thiolations and their redox pathways in pathogenic bacteria under infection conditions to discover new drug targets and treatment options against multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria.",

     "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a multi-factorial disease that is the leading cause of irreversible and severe vision loss in the developed countries. It has been suggested that the pathogenesis of dry AMD involves impaired protein degradation in retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE). RPE cells are constantly exposed to oxidative stress that may lead to the accumulation of damaged cellular proteins, DNA and lipids and evoke tissue deterioration during the aging process. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and the lysosomal/autophagosomal pathway are the two major proteolytic systems in eukaryotic cells. NRF-2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor-2) and PGC-1\u03b1 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha) are master transcription factors in the regulation of cellular detoxification. We investigated the role of NRF-2 and PGC-1\u03b1 in the regulation of RPE cell structure and function by using global double knockout (dKO) mice. The NRF-2/PGC-1\u03b1 dKO mice exhibited significant age-dependent RPE degeneration, accumulation of the oxidative stress marker, 4-HNE (4-hydroxynonenal), the endoplasmic reticulum stress markers GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78) and ATF4 (activating transcription factor 4), and damaged mitochondria. Moreover, levels of protein ubiquitination and autophagy markers p62/SQSTM1 (sequestosome 1), Beclin-1 and LC3B (microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta) were significantly increased together with the Iba-1 (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1) mononuclear phagocyte marker and an enlargement of RPE size. These histopathological changes of RPE were accompanied by photoreceptor dysmorphology and vision loss as revealed by electroretinography. Consequently, these novel findings suggest that the NRF-2/PGC-1\u03b1 dKO mouse is a valuable model for investigating the role of proteasomal and autophagy clearance in the RPE and in the development of dry AMD.",

Electromagnetic radiation in the red and near infrared region has been shown to stimulate NOS-independent but NO-dependent vasodilation, and thereby has significant therapeutic potential. We have recently shown that red light induces acute vasodilatation in the pre-constricted murine facial artery via the release of an endothelium derived substance. In this study we have investigated the mechanism of vasodilatation and conclude that 670\u202fnm light stimulates vasodilator release from an endothelial store, and that this vasodilator has the characteristics of an S-nitrosothiol (RSNO). This study shows that 670\u202fnm irradiation can be used as a targeted and non-invasive means to release biologically relevant amounts of vasodilator from endothelial stores. This raises the possibility that these stores can be pharmacologically built-up in pathological situations to improve the efficacy of red light treatment.

This hormetic response was mediated through both the Nrf2 ortholog, SKN-1, and the forkhead box O (FOXO) family transcription factor DAF-16. As FOXO signaling is evolutionarily conserved, we analyzed here the effects of DEM exposure on FOXO in cultured human cells (HepG2, HEK293). DEM elicited nuclear accumulation of GFP-coupled wild-type human FOXO1, as well as of a cysteine-deficient FOXO1 mutant. Despite the nuclear accumulation of FOXO1, neither FOXO1 DNA binding nor FOXO target gene expression were stimulated, suggesting that DEM causes nuclear accumulation but not activation of FOXO1. FOXO1 nuclear exclusion elicited by insulin or xenobiotics such as arsenite or copper ions was attenuated by DEM, suggesting that DEM interfered with nuclear export. In addition, insulin-induced FOXO1 phosphorylation at Thr-24, which is associated with FOXO1 nuclear exclusion, was attenuated upon exposure to DEM. Different from FOXO-dependent expression of genes, Nrf2 target gene mRNAs were elevated upon exposure to DEM. These data suggest that, different from C. elegans, DEM elicits opposing effects on the two stress-responsive transcription factors, Nrf2 and FOXO1, in cultured human cells.",

     "abstract": "It is known that some metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Au) markedly increase the toxic effect of thiocarbamates. It was shown in the present study that hydroxycobalamin (a form of vitamin B12, HOCbl), which incorporates cobalt, significantly enhances the cytotoxicity of diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), decreasing its IC50 value in tumor cells three to five times. The addition of HOCbl to aqueous DDC solutions accelerated the reduction of oxygen. No hydrogen peroxide accumulation was observed in DDC\u202f+\u202fHOCbl solutions; however, catalase slowed down the oxygen reduction rate. Catalase as well as the antioxidants N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and glutathione (GSH) partially inhibited the cytotoxic effect of DDC\u202f+\u202fHOCbl, whereas ascorbate, pyruvate, and tiron, a scavenger of superoxide anion, had no cytoprotective effect. The administration of HOCbl into DDC solutions (>\u202f1\u202fmM) resulted in the formation of a crystalline precipitate, which was inhibited in the presence of GSH. The data of UV and NMR spectroscopy and HPLC and Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) indicated that the main products of the reaction of DDC with HOCbl are disulfiram (DSF) and its oxidized forms, sulfones and sulfoxides. The increase in the cytotoxicity of DDC combined with HOCbl occurred both in the presence of Cu2+ in culture medium and in nominally Cu-free solutions, as well as in growth medium containing the copper chelator bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS). The results indicate that HOCbl accelerates the oxidation of DDC with the formation of DSF and its oxidized forms. Presumably, the main cause of the synergistic increase in the toxic effect of DDC +\u202fHOCbl is the formation of sulfones and sulfoxides of DSF.",

     "abstract": "The primary cilium, which protrudes from the cell surface, is associated with the pathogenesis of various diseases, including acute kidney injury (AKI). Primary cilium length dynamically changes during the progression of diseases. However, its relevance in disease and the underlying mechanism are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of primary cilia in AKI induced by cisplatin, an effective anticancer drug, and the underlying mechanisms. In addition, we evaluated the usefulness of length alteration and deciliation of primary cilia into the urine for the diagnosis of AKI. Cisplatin induced shortening, elongation, and normalization of the primary cilia in kidney epithelial cells over time. During shortening, primary cilia fragments and ciliary proteins were excreted into the urine. During deciliation, cell proliferation and the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and proliferating cell nuclear antigen were not significantly changed. Shortening and deciliation of primary cilia were observed before significant increases in plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen concentration occurred. Pretreatment with Mito-Tempo, a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, prevented cisplatin-induced primary cilium shortening and inhibited the increases in superoxide formation, lipid peroxidation, blood urea nitrogen, and tissue damage. In contrast, isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (Idh2) gene deletion, which results in defect of the NADPH-associated mitochondrial antioxidant system, exacerbated cisplatin-induced changes in mice. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that cisplatin induces deciliation into the urine and antioxidant treatment prevents this deciliation, renal dysfunction, and tissue damage after cisplatin injection. These results suggest that cisplatin-induced AKI is associated with primary cilia and urine primary cilia proteins might be a non-invasive biomarker of kidney injury.",

However, little is known about the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) redox homeostasis in HHcy-induced endothelial dysfunction. Here, we show that Hcy induces ER oxidoreductin-1\u03b1 (Ero1\u03b1) expression with ER stress and inflammation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and in the arteries of HHcy mice. Hcy upregulates Ero1\u03b1 expression by promoting binding of hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 to the ERO1A promoter. Notably, Hcy rather than other thiol agents markedly increases the GSH/GSSG ratio in the ER, therefore allosterically activating Ero1\u03b1 to produce H2O2 and trigger ER oxidative stress. By contrast, the antioxidant pathway mediated by ER glutathione peroxidase 7 (GPx7) is downregulated in HHcy mice. Ero1\u03b1 knockdown and GPx7 overexpression protect the endothelium from HHcy-induced ER oxidative stress and inflammation. Our work suggests that targeting ER redox homeostasis could be used as an intervention for HHcy-related vascular diseases.",

However, only very limited knowledge exists about the regulation of HDAC8, an established target in multiple types of cancer. A previous dedicated study of HDAC class I enzymes identified no redox-sensitive cysteinyl thiol in HDAC8. This is in contrast to the observation that HDAC8 preparations show different enzyme activities depending on the addition of reducing agents. In the light of the importance of HDAC8 in tumorigenesis a possible regulation by redox signaling was investigated using biochemical and biophysical methods combined with site directed mutagenesis. The occurrence of a characteristic disulfide bond under oxidizing conditions is associated with a complete but reversible loss of enzyme activity. Cysteines 102 and 153 are the integral components of the redox-switch. A possible regulation of HDAC8 by redox signal transduction is suggested by the observed relationship between inhibition of reactive oxygen species generating NOX and concomitant increased HDAC8 activity in neuroblastoma tumor cells. The slow kinetics for direct oxidation of HDAC8 by hydrogen peroxide suggests that transmitters of oxidative equivalents are required to transfer the H2O2 signal to HDAC8.",

Sod1-/- mice are characterized by reduced SERCA activity, muscle weakness and atrophy, increased oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Seven weeks of CDN1163 treatment completely restored SERCA activity and reversed the 23% reduction in gastrocnemius mass and 22% reduction in specific force in untreated Sod1-/- versus wild type mice. These changes were accompanied by restoration of autophagy protein markers to the levels found in wild-type mice. CDN1163 also reversed the increase in mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative damage in muscle tissue from Sod1-/- mice. Taken together our findings suggest that the pharmacological restoration of SERCA is a promising therapeutic approach to counter oxidative stress-associated muscle impairment.",

Previous studies have indicated that Mas receptor activation initiates an anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic role in the brain. However, whether Mas activation can attenuate oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis after SAH remains unknown. To investigate the beneficial effect of Mas on oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis induced by SAH, a total of 196 rats were subjected to an endovascular perforation model of SAH. AVE 0991 (AVE), a selective agonist of Mas, was administered intranasally 1\u202fh after SAH induction. A779, a selective inhibitor of Mas, and small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) for UCP-2 were administered by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection at 1\u202fh and 48\u202fh before SAH induction respectively. Neurological tests, immunofluorescence, TUNEL, Fluoro-Jade C, DHE staining, and Western blot experiments were performed. We found that Mas activation with AVE significantly improved neurobehavioral scores and reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis in SAH+AVE group compared with SAH+vehicle group. Moreover, AVE treatment significantly promoted phosphorylation of CREB and the expression UCP-2, as well as upregulated expression of Bcl-2 and downregulation of Romo-1 and Bax. The protective effects of AVE were reversed by i.c.v injection of A779 and UCP-2 siRNA in SAH+AVE+A779 and SAH+AVE+UCP-2 siRNA groups, respectively. In conclusion, our data provides evidence that Mas activation with AVE reduces oxidative stress injury and neuronal apoptosis through Mas/PKA/p-CREB/UCP-2 pathway after SAH. Furthermore, our study indicates that Mas may be a novel therapeutic treatment target in early brain injury of SAH.",

Here we tested the hypothesis that fenofibrate improves vascular endothelial dysfunction by balancing endothelium-dependent relaxation and contractility of the aorta in diabetes mellitus (DM). In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, eight weeks of fenofibrate treatment (100\u202fmg/Kg/d) improved endothelium dependent relaxation in the macro- and microvessels, increased nitric oxide (NO) levels, reduced renal damage markers and effects of the vasoconstrictor prostaglandin. Levels of superoxide dismutase and catalase were both reduced and hydrogen peroxide was increased in vehicle-treated DM, but these changes were reversed by fenofibrate treatment. Vasodilation of the aorta after fenofibrate treatment was reversed by PPAR\u03b1 or AMPK\u03b1 inhibitors. Western blots showed that fenofibrate treatment elevated PPAR\u03b1 expression, induced liver kinase B1 (LKB1) translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and activated AMP-activated protein kinase-\u03b1 (AMPK\u03b1), thus activating endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). Also, fenofibrate treatment decreased NF-\u03baB p65 and cyclooxygenase 2 proteins in aortas. Finally, incubation with indomethacin in vitro improved aortic contractility in diabetic mice. Overall, our results show that fenofibrate treatment in diabetic mice normalizes endothelial function by balancing vascular reactivity via increasing NO production and suppressing the vasoconstrictor prostaglandin, suggesting mechanism of action of fenofibrate in mediating diabetic vascular complications.",

Cisplatin is typically administered in weekly or tri-weekly cycles as part of standard cancer therapy. To investigate the role of O2\u2022- in predisposing patients to future renal injury and in CKD, mice were treated with cisplatin and a mitochondrial-specific, superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic, GC4419. Renal function, biomarkers of oxidative stress, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, and kidney injury markers, as well as renal histology, were assessed to evaluate the cellular changes that occur one week and one month (CKD phase) after the cisplatin insult. Cisplatin treatment resulted in persistent upregulation of kidney injury markers, increased steady-state levels of O2\u2022-, increased O2\u2022--mediated renal tubules damage, and upregulation of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complex I activity both one week and one month following cisplatin treatment.

Deficiencies in complex I of the electron transport chain (ETC) contribute to 30\u201340% of all cases of mitochondrial diseases, and leads to eye disease including optic nerve atrophy and retinal degeneration. The mechanisms responsible for organ damage in mitochondrial defects may include energy deficit, oxidative stress, and an increase in the NADH/NAD+ redox ratio due to decreased NAD+ regeneration. Currently, there is no effective treatment to alleviate human disease induced by complex I defect.Photoreceptor cells have the highest energy demand and dependence on OXPHOS for survival, and the lowest reserve capacity indicating that they are sensitive to OXPHOS defects. We investigated the effect of mitochondrial OXPHOS deficiency on retinal photoreceptors in a model of mitochondrial complex I defect (apoptosis inducing factor, AIF-deficient mice, Harlequin mice), and tested the protective effect of a mitochondrial redox compound (methylene blue, MB) on mitochondrial and photoreceptor integrity. MB prevented the reduction in the retinal thickness and protein markers for photoreceptor outer segments, Muller and ganglion cells, and altered mitochondrial integrity and function induced by AIF deficiency. In rotenone-induced complex I deficient 661\u202fW cells (an immortalized mouse photoreceptor cell line) MB decreased the NADH/NAD+ ratio and oxidative stress without correcting the energy deficit, and improved cell survival. MB deactivated the mitochondrial stress response pathways, the unfolding protein response and mitophagy.

Our results showed that tert-BuOOH caused time- and concentration-dependent cytotoxicity, which was preceded by increased oxidants production and mitochondrial dysfunction. (PhSe)2 pre-incubation significantly prevented these cytotoxic events and the observed protective effects were paralleled by the upregulation of the cellular glutathione-dependent antioxidant system: (PhSe)2 increased GSH levels (>\u202f60%), GPx activity (6.9-fold) and the mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes Gpx1 (3.9-fold) and Gclc (2.3-fold). Of note, the cytoprotective effect of (PhSe)2 was significantly decreased when cells were treated with mercaptosuccinic acid, an inhibitor of GPx, indicating the involvement of GPx modulation in the observed protective effect. In summary, the present findings bring out a new action mechanism concerning the antioxidant properties of (PhSe)2.

MAOs control the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain via oxidative deamination and contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation through their catalytic by-product H2O2. Increased ROS levels may modulate mitochondrial function and mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in a vast array of disorders. However, the downstream effects of MAO-A mediated ROS production in a neuronal model has not been previously investigated.In this study, using MAO-A overexpressing neuroblastoma cells, we demonstrate that higher levels of MAO-A protein/activity results in increased basal ROS levels with associated increase in protein oxidation. Increased MAO-A levels result in increased Lysine-63 linked ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins and promotes autophagy through Bcl-2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, ROS generated locally on the mitochondrial outer membrane by MAO-A promotes phosphorylation of dynamin-1-like protein, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and clearance without complete loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Cellular ATP levels are maintained following MAO-A overexpression and complex IV activity/protein levels increased, revealing a close relationship between MAO-A levels and mitochondrial function. Finally, the downstream effects of increased MAO-A levels are dependent on the availability of amine substrates and in the presence of exogenous substrate, cell viability is dramatically reduced.This study shows for the first time that MAO-A generated ROS is involved in quality control signalling, and increase in MAO-A protein levels leads to a protective cellular response in order to mediate removal of damaged macromolecules/organelles, but substrate availability may ultimately determine cell fate. The latter is particularly important in conditions such as Parkinson's disease, where a dopamine precursor is used to treat disease symptoms and highlights that the fate of MAO-A containing dopaminergic neurons may depend on both MAO-A levels and catecholamine substrate availability.",

In this study, we investigated mechanisms involved in 5-Aminolevulinic Acid (5-ALA)\u2013based PDT against keloid. Found that 5-ALA-PDT induced superoxide anion-dependent autophagic cell death. Application of autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) significantly prevented the effect that 5-ALA-PDT induced keloid\u2013derived fibroblasts death, but Z-VAK-FMK (apoptotic inhibitor) did not. Interestingly, 5-ALA-PDT promoted the SIRT3 protein expression and the activity of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), but SIRT1 protein expression level was decreased. SOD2 as a key enzyme can decrease mitochondrial ROS (mROS) level, Deacetylation of SOD2 by SIRT3 regulates SOD2 enzymatic activity has been identified. Then we explored SOD2 acetylation level with immunoprecipitation, found that 5-ALA-PDT significantly increased the acetylation levels of SOD2. In order to confirm deacetylation of SOD2 regulated by SIRT3, 3-TYP (SIRT3 inhibitor) was used. Found that inhibition of SIRT3 by 3-TYP significantly increased the level of SOD2 acetylation level compared with control group or 5-ALA-PDT group. To explore the connection of SIRT1 and SIRT3, cells were treated with EX527(SIRT1 inhibitor) or SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator), and EX527 increased SIRT3 protein level, however, SRT1720 displayed the opposite effect in the present or absence of 5-ALA-PDT. Moreover SIRT1-inhibited cells are more resistant to 5-ALA-PDT and showing decreased ROS accumulation. These results may demonstrate that 5-ALA-PDT induced SIRT1 protein level decreased, which promoted the effect of SIRT3 increased activity of SOD2 that can reduce mROS level, and then compromised 5-ALA-PDT induced autophagic cell death.",

To elucidate mitochondrial complex I-dependent ROS-signaling after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation THP-1 macrophages with a knockdown of the transmembrane protein TMEM126B were generated. TMEM knockdown cells (sh126B) showed a reduced assembly of complex I and attenuated mtROS production. In these cells we identified protein oxidization by mtROS upon LPS-treatment using the BIAM switch assay coupled to liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. One of the identified targets of mtROS was succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) flavoprotein subunit A (SDHA). Oxidation of SDHA decreased its enzymatic activity and pharmacological inhibition of SDH in turn stabilized hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1 and caused the subsequent, sustained expression of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2). Oxidation of SDHA in sh126B cells was attenuated, while pharmacological inhibition of SDH by atpenin A5 restored IL-1\u03b2 expression in sh126B cells upon LPS-treatment. Conclusively, oxidation of SDH by mtROS links an altered metabolism, i.e. succinate accumulation to HIF-1-driven, inflammatory changes in macrophages.",

To address underlying mechanisms we generated SH-SY5Y neuronal cells constitutively expressing nNOS at a level similar to mouse brain (nNOS+ versus MOCK). Initial experiments revealed S-nitrosylations (SNO) of key players of protein homeostasis: heat shock cognate HSC70/HSPA8 within its nucleotide-binding site, and UBE2D ubiquitin conjugating enzymes at the catalytic site cysteine. HSPA8 is involved in protein folding, organelle import/export and chaperone-mediated LAMP2a-dependent autophagy (CMA). A set of deep redox and full proteome analyses, plus analysis of autophagy, CMA and ubiquitination with rapamycin and starvation as stimuli confirmed the initial observations and revealed a substantial increase of SNO modifications in nNOS+ cells, in particular targeting protein networks involved in protein catabolism, ubiquitination, carbohydrate metabolism and cell cycle control. Importantly, NO-independent reversible oxidations similarly occurred in both cell lines. Functionally, nNOS caused an accumulation of proteins, including CMA substrates and loss of LAMP2a. UBE2D activity and proteasome activity were impaired, resulting in dysregulations of cell cycle checkpoint proteins. The observed changes of protein degradation pathways caused an expansion of the cytoplasm, large lysosomes, slowing of the cell cycle and suppression of proliferation suggesting a switch of the phenotype towards aging, supported by downregulations of neuronal progenitor markers but increase of senescence-associated proteins. Hence, upregulation of nNOS in neuronal cells imposes aging by SNOing of key players of ubiquitination, chaperones and of substrate proteins leading to interference with crucial steps of protein homeostasis.",

In this study, we have further investigated the anti-tumor effects of D5D-knockdown and the resulting intensified COX-2-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation in subcutaneous xenograft tumors. Four-week old female nude mice (Jackson Laboratory, J:Nu-007850) were injected with human pancreatic cancer cell line BxPC-3 or its D5D knockdown counterpart (via shRNA), followed by 4-week treatments of: vehicle control, DGLA supplementation (8\u202fmg/mouse, twice a week), gemcitabine (30\u202fmg/kg, twice a week), and a combination of DGLA and gemcitabine. In D5D-knockdown tumors, DGLA supplementation promoted 8-HOA formation to a threshold level (> 0.3\u202f\u00b5g/g) and resulted in significant tumor reduction (30% vs. control). The promoted 8-HOA not only induced apoptosis associated with altered expression of Bcl-2, cleaved PARP, procaspase 3 and procaspase 9, but also suppressed the tumor metastatic potential via altering MMP-2 and E-cadherin expression. DGLA supplementation resulted in similar anti-tumor effects to those of gemcitabine in our experiments, while the combined treatment led to most significant inhibitory effect on D5D-knockdown tumor growth (70% reduction vs. control).

     "abstract": "Despite extensive research that has been carried out over the past three decades in the field of renal ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury, the pathogenic role of mitochondrial fission in renal I/R injury is poorly understood. The aim of our study is to investigate the molecular mechanism by which mammalian STE20-like kinase 1 (Mst1) participates in renal I/R injury through modifying mitochondrial fission, microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics, and the GSK3\u03b2-p53 signalling pathway. Our data demonstrated that genetic ablation of Mst1 improved renal function, alleviated reperfusion-mediated tubular epithelial cell apoptosis, and attenuated the vulnerability of kidney to I/R injury. At the molecular level, Mst1 upregulation exacerbated mitochondrial damage, as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial potential, increased ROS generation, more cyt-c liberation from mitochondria into the cytoplasm, and an activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that I/R-mediated mitochondrial damage resulted from mitochondrial fission, and the blockade of mitochondrial fission preserved mitochondrial homeostasis in the I/R setting. Functional studies have discovered that Mst1 regulated mitochondrial fission through two mechanisms: induction of Drp1 phosphorylation and enhancement of F-actin assembly. Activated Mst1 promoted Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser616, contributing to Drp1 translocation from the cytoplasm to the surface of the mitochondria. Additionally, Mst1 facilitated F-actin polymerization, contributing to mitochondrial contraction. Finally, we confirmed that Mst1 regulated Drp1 post-transcriptional modification and F-actin stabilization via the GSK3\u03b2-p53 signalling pathway. Inhibition of GSK3\u03b2-p53 signalling provided a survival advantage for the tubular epithelial cell in the context of renal I/R injury by repressing mitochondrial fission. Collectively, our study identified Mst1 as the primary pathogenesis for the development and progression of renal I/R injury via activation of fatal mitochondrial fission by modulating Drp1 phosphorylation, microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics, and the GSK3\u03b2-p53 signalling pathway.",

Without medical countermeasures, exposure to soman and resultant SE leads to high morbidity and mortality. Currently available therapeutics are effective in limiting mortality, however effects on morbidity are highly time-dependent and rely on the ability to suppress SE. We have previously demonstrated significant protection from secondary neuronal injury in surrogate nerve agent models by targeting oxidative stress. However, whether oxidative stress represents a relevant therapeutic target in genuine nerve agent toxicity is unknown. Here, we demonstrate that soman exposure results in robust region- and time-dependent oxidative stress. Targeting this oxidative stress in a post-exposure paradigm using a small molecular weight, broad spectrum catalytic antioxidant, was sufficient to attenuate brain and plasma oxidative stress, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Thus, targeting of oxidative stress in a post-exposure paradigm can mitigate secondary neuronal injury following soman exposure.",

     "abstract": "A low concentration of arsenite (6\u202fh), selectively stimulating the intraluminal crosstalk between the inositol-1, 4, 5-triphosphate receptor and the ryanodine receptor (RyR), increased the mitochondrial transport of RyR-derived Ca2+ through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter. This event was characterized in intact and permeabilized cells, and was shown to be critical for mitochondrial superoxide (mitoO2.-) formation. Inhibition of mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation therefore prevented the effects of arsenite, in both the mitochondrial (e.g., cardiolipin oxidation) and extramitochondrial (e.g., DNA single- strand breakage) compartments, and suppressed the Nrf2/GSH survival signaling. The effects of arsenite on Ca2+ homeostasis and mitoO2.- formation were reversible, as determined after an additional 10\u202fh incubation in fresh culture medium and by measuring long-term viability. A 16\u202fh continuous exposure to arsenite instead produced a sustained increase in the cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations, a further increased mitoO2.- formation and mitochondrial permeability transition. These events, followed by delayed apoptosis (48\u202fh), were sensitive to treatments/manipulations preventing mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation. Interestingly, cells remained viable under conditions in which the deregulated Ca2+ homeostasis was not accompanied by mitoO2.-formation.In conclusion, we report that the fraction of Ca2+ taken up by the mitochondria in response to arsenite derives from the RyR. Mitochondrial Ca2+ appears critical for mitoO2.- formation and for the triggering of both the cytoprotective and apoptotic signaling. The effects of arsenite were reversible, whereas its prolonged exposure caused a sustained increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ and mitoO2.- formation, and the prevalence of the apoptotic vs survival signaling.",

In this study, we found that serum and liver irisin levels were markedly decreased at 24\u202fh after hepatic I/R. Treatment with exogenous irisin improved liver function, reduced liver necrosis and cell apoptosis, and relieved inflammatory response after hepatic I/R. Meanwhile, exogenous irisin markedly inhibited mitochondrial fission related protein dynamin related protein 1 (drp-1) and fission 1 (Fis-1) expression in hepatic I/R. Additionally, treatment with exogenous irisin increased mitochondrial content and increased mitochondrial biogenesis related peroxisome proliferative activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) co-activator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1) and mitochondrial transcription factor (TFAM) expression.

Despite the wide-ranging effects ascribed to NPWT, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the accelerated healing supported by NPWT remains poorly understood. Notably, cellular redox status-a product of the balance between cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and anti-oxidant defense systems-plays an important role in wound healing and dysregulation of redox homeostasis has a profound effect on wound healing. Here we investigated potential links between the use of NPWT and the regulation of antioxidant mechanisms. Using patient samples and a rodent model of acute injury, we observed a significant accumulation of MnSOD protein as well as higher enzymatic activity in tissues upon NPWT. As a proof of concept and to outline the important role of SOD activity in wound healing, we replaced NPWT by the topical application of a MnSOD mimetic, Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin (MnTE-2-PyP5+, MnE, BMX-010, AEOl10113) in the rodent model. We observed that MnE is a potent wound healing enhancer as it appears to facilitate the formation of new tissue within the wound bed and consequently advances wound closure by two days, compared to the non-treated animals. Taken together, these results show for the first time a link between NPWT and regulation of antioxidant mechanism through the maintenance of MnSOD activity. Additionally this discovery outlined the potential role of MnSOD mimetics as topical agents enhancing wound healing.",

Our recent studies have found that the transcription factor Bhlhe40 negatively regulates PGC-1\u03b1 gene expression and its coactivational activity, therefore, this factor should have profound influence on the biogenesis and metabolic activity of mitochondria and peroxisomes. Here we found that both the number and activity of peroxisomes were increased upon knockdown of Bhlhe40 expression but were repressed by its over-expression. Mitochondrial efficiency was significantly reduced by Bhlhe40 knockdown, resulting in the burst of ROS. Over-expression of a constitutively active PGC-1\u03b1-interactive domain (named as VBH135) of Bhlhe40 mimicked the effects of its knockdown on peroxisomes but simultaneously reduced ROS level. Furthermore, the efficiency, but not the number, of mitochondria was also increased by VBH135, suggesting differential regulation of peroxisomes and mitochondria by Bhlhe40. Unsaturated fatty acid oxidation, insulin response, and oxidative respiration were highly enhanced in Bhlhe40 knockdown or VBH135 over-expressed cells, suggesting the importance of Bhlhe40 in the regulation of unsaturated fatty acid and glucose oxidative metabolism. Expression profiling of genes important for either organelle also supports differential regulation of peroxisomes and mitochondria by Bhlhe40. These observations have established the important role of Bhlhe40 in SKM oxidative metabolism as the critical regulator of peroxisome and mitochondrion biogenesis and functions, and thus should provide a novel route for developing drugs targeting SKM metabolic diseases.",

The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major arbiter in counteracting these insults via up-regulation of several defensive proteins, including heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). HO-1-derived carbon monoxide (CO) exhibits anti-inflammatory actions and can be delivered to tissues by CO-releasing agents. In this study we assessed the pharmacological and anti-inflammatory properties of HYCO-3, a dual activity compound obtained by conjugating analogues of the CO-releasing molecule CORM-401 and dimethyl fumarate (DMF), an immunomodulatory drug known to activate Nrf2. HYCO-3 induced Nrf2-dependent genes and delivered CO to cells in vitro and tissues in vivo, confirming that the two expected pharmacological properties of this agent are achieved. In mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide, orally administered HYCO-3 reduced the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory markers (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6) while increasing the expression of the anti-inflammatory genes ARG1 and IL-10 in brain, liver, lung and heart. In contrast, DMF or CORM-401 alone or their combination decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory genes but had limited influence on anti-inflammatory markers. Furthermore, HYCO-3 diminished TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in brain and liver but not in lung and heart of Nrf2-/- mice, indicating that the CO-releasing part of this hybrid contributes to reduction of pro-inflammation and that this effect is organ-specific.

SelenoN knockout (KO) mouse limb muscles, however, are protected from the disease, and display no major alterations in muscle histology or contractile properties. Interestingly, we find that the highly active diaphragm muscle shows impaired force production, in line with the human phenotype. In addition, after repeated stimulation with a protocol which induces muscle fatigue, also hind limb muscles show altered relaxation times. Mechanistically, muscle SELENON loss alters activity-dependent calcium handling selectively impinging on the Ca2+ uptake of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and elicits an ER stress response, including the expression of the maladaptive CHOP-induced ERO1. In SELENON-devoid models, ERO1 shifts ER redox to a more oxidised poise, and further affects Ca2+ uptake. Importantly, CHOP ablation in SelenoN KO mice completely prevents diaphragm dysfunction, the prolonged limb muscle relaxation after fatigue, and restores Ca2+ uptake by attenuating the induction of ERO1. These findings suggest that SELENON is part of an ER stress-dependent antioxidant response and that the CHOP/ERO1 branch of the ER stress response is a novel pathogenic mechanism underlying SELENON-related myopathies.",

Despite the ongoing clinical trials, little is known about the effect of MnPs on metastasis, being therefore essential to understand how MnPs affect this process. In the present work, the impact of the MnP MnTnHex-2-PyP5+ in metastasis-related processes was assessed in breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231), alone or in combination with doxorubicin (dox). The co-treatment of cells with non-cytotoxic concentrations of MnP and dox altered intracellular ROS, increasing H2O2. While MnP alone did not modify cell migration, the co-exposure led to a reduction in collective cell migration and chemotaxis. In addition, the MnP reduced the dox-induced increase in random migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment with either MnP or dox decreased the proteolytic invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells, although the effect was more pronounced upon co-exposure with both compounds. Moreover, to explore the cellular mechanisms underlying the observed effects, cell adhesion, spreading, focal adhesions, and NF-\u03baB activation were also studied. Although differential effects were observed according to the endpoints analysed, overall, the alterations induced by MnP in dox-treated cells were consistent with a therapeutically favorable outcome.",

     "abstract": "Most toxic compounds including cancer drugs target mitochondria culminating in its permeabilization. Cancer drug-screening and toxicological testing of compounds require cost-effective and sensitive high-throughput methods to detect mitochondrial damage. Real-time methods for detection of mitochondrial damage are less toxic, allow kinetic measurements with good spatial resolution and are preferred over end-stage assays.Cancer cell lines stably expressing genetically encoded mitochondrial-targeted redox-GFP2 (mt-roGFP) were developed and validated for its suitability as a mitochondrial damage sensor. Diverse imaging platforms and flow-cytometry were utilized for ratiometric analysis of redox changes with known toxic and cancer drugs. Key events of cell death and mitochondrial damage were studied at single-cell level coupled with mt-roGFP. Cells stably expressing mt-roGFP and H2B-mCherry were developed for high-throughput screening (HTS) application.Most cancer drugs while inducing mitochondrial permeabilization trigger mitochondrial-oxidation that can be detected at single-cell level with mt-roGFP. The image-based assay using mt-roGFP outperformed other quantitative methods of apoptosis in ease of screening. Incorporation of H2B-mCherry ensures accurate and complete automated segmentation with excellent Z value. The results substantiate that most cancer drugs and known plant-derived antioxidants trigger cell-death through mitochondrial redox alterations with pronounced ratio change in the mt-roGFP probe.Real-time analysis of mitochondrial oxidation and mitochondrial permeabilization reveal a biphasic ratio change in dying cells, with an initial redox surge before mitochondrial permeabilization followed by a drastic increase in ratio after complete mitochondrial permeabilization. Overall, the results prove that mitochondrial oxidation is a reliable indicator of mitochondrial damage, which can be readily determined in live cells using mt-roGFP employing diverse imaging techniques. The assay described is highly sensitive, easy to adapt to HTS platforms and is a valuable resource for identifying cytotoxic agents that target mitochondria and also for dissecting cell signaling events relevant to redox biology.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that resveratrol (RES) exerts a protective role in hypertrophic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully elucidated. In this study, cardiac hypertrophic remodeling in mice were established by pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and invasive pressure-volume analysis. Cardiomyocyte size was detected by wheat germ agglutinin staining. The protein and gene expressions of signaling mediators and hypertrophic markers were examined. Our results showed that administration of RES significantly suppressed pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and apoptosis and improved in vivo heart function in mice. RES also reversed pre-established hypertrophy and restoring contractile dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload. Moreover, RES treatment blocked TAC-induced increase of immunoproteasome activity and catalytic subunit expression (\u03b21i, \u03b22i and \u03b25i), which inhibited PTEN degradation thereby leading to inactivation of AKT/mTOR and activation of AMPK signals. Further, blocking PTEN by the specific inhibitor VO-Ohpic significantly attenuated RES inhibitory effect on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that RES is a novel inhibitor of immunoproteasome activity, and may represent a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of hypertrophic diseases.",

Unfortunately, prolonged MV results in rapid diaphragmatic atrophy and contractile dysfunction, collectively termed ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD). Recent evidence reveals that endurance exercise training, performed prior to MV, protects the diaphragm against VIDD. While the mechanism(s) responsible for this exercise-induced protection against VIDD remain unknown, increased diaphragm antioxidant expression may be required. To investigate the role that increased antioxidants play in this protection, we tested the hypothesis that elevated levels of the mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) is required to achieve exercise-induced protection against VIDD. Cause and effect was investigated in two ways. First, we prevented the exercise-induced increase in diaphragmatic SOD2 via delivery of an antisense oligonucleotide targeted against SOD2 post-exercise. Second, using transgene overexpression of SOD2, we determined the effects of increased SOD2 in the diaphragm independent of exercise training. Results from these experiments revealed that prevention of the exercise-induced increases in diaphragmatic SOD2 results in a loss of exercise-mediated protection against MV-induced diaphragm atrophy and a partial loss of protection against MV-induced diaphragmatic contractile dysfunction. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of SOD2 in the diaphragm, independent of exercise, did not protect against MV-induced diaphragmatic atrophy and provided only partial protection against MV-induced diaphragmatic contractile dysfunction. Collectively, these results demonstrate that increased diaphragmatic levels of SOD2 are essential to achieve the full benefit of exercise-induced protection against VIDD.",

Increasing evidence suggests that several aspects of necrosis are programmed and tightly regulated, so targeting the necrosis process has become a new trend for myocardial protection. Multiple cellular signaling pathways have been implicated in necrotic cell death, such as the death receptor-mediated extrinsic and mitochondrial intrinsic pathways. However, the precise mechanisms underlying myocardial necrosis remain unclear. In this study, we showed that apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) participated in the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway and inhibited myocardial necrosis by preventing the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). ARC attenuated necrotic cell death triggered by exposure to 500\u202f\u03bcM hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the cardiomyocyte cell line H9c2. In mice, ARC ameliorated myocardial necrosis, reduced the myocardial infarct size and improved long-term heart function during I/R injury. Mechanistically, it has been shown that the inhibition of necrosis by ARC was dependent on its mitochondrial localization and that ARC prevented the opening of mPTP by targeting CypD, the main regulator of mPTP. In addition, ARC expression was negatively regulated by the transcription factor p53 at the transcriptional level during the necrosis process. These findings identified the novel role of ARC in myocardial necrosis and delineated the p53-ARC-CypD/mPTP necrosis pathway during ischemia- and oxidative stress-induced myocardial damage, which can provide a new strategy for cardiac protection.",

Here, we demonstrated the tumor-promoting role of BPTF in HCC progression. BPTF was highly expressed in HCC cells and tumor tissues of HCC patients compared with normal liver cells and tissues. Knockdown of BPTF inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation and stem cell-like traits in HCC cells. In addition, BPTF knockdown effectively sensitized the anti-tumor effect of chemotherapeutic drugs and induced more apoptosis in HCC cells. Consistently, knockdown of BPTF in a xenograft mouse model also suppressed tumor growth and metastasis accompanied by the suppression of cancer stem cells (CSC)-related protein markers. Moreover, the mechanism study showed that the tumor-promoting role of BPTF in HCC was realized by transcriptionally regulating the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Furthermore, we found that HCC patients with high BPTF expression displayed high hTERT expression, and high BPTF or hTERT expression level was positively correlated with advanced malignancy and poor prognosis in HCC patients. Collectively, our results demonstrate that BPTF promotes HCC growth by targeting hTERT and suggest that the BPTF-hTERT axis maybe a novel and potential therapeutic target in HCC.",

Substantial evidence suggests that deoxygenated hemoglobin within red blood cells (RBCs) is the main erythrocytic protein responsible for mediating nitrite-dependent NO signaling. In other work, infrared and far red light have been shown to have therapeutic potential that some attribute to production of NO. Here we explore whether a combination of nitrite and far red light treatment has an additive effect in NO-dependent processes, and whether this effect is mediated by RBCs.Using photoacoustic imaging in a rat model as a function of varying inspired oxygen, we found that far red light (660\u202fnm, five min. exposure) and nitrite feeding (three weeks in drinking water at 100\u202fmg/L) each separately increased tissue oxygenation and vessel diameter, and the combined treatment was additive. We also employed inhibition of human platelet activation measured by flow cytometry to assess RBC-dependent nitrite bioactivation and found that far red light dramatically potentiates platelet inhibition by nitrite. Blocking RBC-surface thiols abrogated these effects of nitrite and far-red light. RBC-dependent production of NO was also shown to be enhanced by far red light using a chemiluminescence-based nitric oxide analyzer. In addition, RBC-dependent bioactivation of nitrite led to prolonged lag times for clotting in platelet poor plasma that was enhanced by exposure to far red light.Our results suggest that nitrite leads to the formation of a photolabile RBC surface thiol-bound species such as an S-nitrosothiol or heme-nitrosyl (NO-bound heme) for which far red light enhances NO signaling. These findings expand our understanding of RBC-mediated NO production from nitrite. This pathway of NO production may have therapeutic potential in several applications including thrombosis, and, thus, warrants further study.",

     "abstract": "Senescence is characterized by a gradual decline in cellular functions, including changes in energy homeostasis and decreased proliferation activity. As cellular power plants, contributors to signal transduction, sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and executors of programmed cell death, mitochondria are in a unique position to affect aging-associated processes of cellular decline. Notably, metabolic activation of mitochondria is tightly linked to Ca2+ due to the Ca2+ -dependency of several enzymes in the Krebs cycle, however, overload of mitochondria with Ca2+ triggers cell death pathways. Consequently, a machinery of proteins tightly controls mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis as well as the exchange of Ca2+ between the different cellular compartments, including Ca2+ flux between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).In this study, we investigated age-related changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis, mitochondrial-ER linkage and the activity of the main ROS production site, the mitochondrial respiration chain, in an in vitro aging model based on porcine aortic endothelial cells (PAECs), using high-resolution live cell imaging, proteomics and various molecular biological methods.We describe that in aged endothelial cells, increased ER-mitochondrial Ca2+ crosstalk occurs due to enhanced ER-mitochondrial tethering. The close functional inter-organelle linkage increases mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake and thereby the activity of the mitochondrial respiration, but also makes senescent cells more vulnerable to mitochondrial Ca2+-overload-induced cell death. Moreover, we identified the senolytic properties of the polyphenol resveratrol, triggering cell death via mitochondrial Ca2+ overload exclusively in senescent cells.By unveiling aging-related changes in the inter-organelle tethering and Ca2+ communications we have advanced the understanding of endothelial aging and highlighted a potential basis to develop drugs specifically targeting senescent cells.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are widely recognized as sources of reactive oxygen species in animal cells, with H2O2 being of particular note because it can act not only in oxidative stress but also is important to several signalling pathways. Lesser recognized is that mitochondria can have far greater capacity to consume H2O2 than to produce it; however, the consumption of H2O2 may be kinetically constrained by H2O2 availability especially at the low nanomolar (or lower) concentrations that occur in vivo. The production of H2O2 is a function of many factors, not the least of which are respiratory substrate availability and the protonmotive force (\u0394p). The \u0394p, which is predominantly membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8), can be a strong indicator of mitochondrial energy status, particularly if respiratory substrate supply is either not meeting or exceeding demand. The notion that mitochondria may functionally act in regulating H2O2 concentrations may be somewhat implicit but little evidence demonstrating this is available. Here we demonstrate key assumptions that are required for mitochondria to act as regulators of H2O2 by an integrated system of production and concomitant consumption. In particular we show the steady-state level of H2O2 mitochondria approach is a function of both mitochondrial H2O2 consumption and production capacity, the latter of which is strongly influenced by \u0394\u03a8. Our results are consistent with mitochondria being able to manipulate extramitochondrial H2O2 as a means of signalling mitochondrial energetic status, in particular the \u0394p or \u0394\u03a8. Such a redox-based signal could operate with some independence from other energy sensing mechanisms such as those that transmit information using the cytosolic adenylate pool.",

     "abstract": "Basement membranes are specialized extracellular matrices that underlie arterial wall endothelial cells, with laminin being a key structural and biologically-active component. Hypochlorous acid (HOCl), a potent oxidizing and chlorinating agent, is formed in vivo at sites of inflammation via the enzymatic action of myeloperoxidase (MPO), released by activated leukocytes. Considerable data supports a role for MPO-derived oxidants in cardiovascular disease and particularly atherosclerosis. These effects may be mediated via extracellular matrix damage to which MPO binds. Herein we detect and quantify sites of oxidation and chlorination on isolated laminin-111, and laminin in basement membrane extracts (BME), by use of mass spectrometry. Increased modification was detected with increasing oxidant exposure. Mass mapping indicated selectivity in the sites and extent of damage; Met residues were most heavily modified. Fewer modifications were detected with BME, possibly due to the shielding effects. HOCl oxidised 30 (of 56 total) Met and 7 (of 24) Trp residues, and chlorinated 33 (of 99) Tyr residues; 3 Tyr were dichlorinated. An additional 8 Met and 10 Trp oxidations, 14 chlorinations, and 18 dichlorinations were detected with the MPO/H2O2/Cl- system when compared to reagent HOCl. Interestingly, chlorination was detected at Tyr2415 in the integrin-binding region; this may decrease cellular adhesion. Co-localization of MPO-damaged epitopes and laminin was detected in human atherosclerotic lesions. These data indicate that laminin is extensively modified by MPO-derived oxidants, with structural and functional changes. These modifications, and compromised cell-matrix interactions, may promote endothelial cell dysfunction, weaken the structure of atherosclerotic lesions, and enhance lesion rupture.",

C. glutamicum maintains a highly reducing intrabacterial EMSH throughout the growth curve with basal EMSH levels of ~\u2212\u202f296\u202fmV. Consistent with its H2O2 resistant phenotype, C. glutamicum responds only weakly to 40\u202fmM H2O2, but is rapidly oxidized by low doses of NaOCl. We further monitored basal EMSH changes and the H2O2 response in various mutants which are compromised in redox-signaling of ROS (OxyR, SigH) and in the antioxidant defense (MSH, Mtr, KatA, Mpx, Tpx). While the probe was constitutively oxidized in the mshC and mtr mutants, a smaller oxidative shift in basal EMSH was observed in the sigH mutant. The catalase KatA was confirmed as major H2O2 detoxification enzyme required for fast biosensor re-equilibration upon return to non-stress conditions. In contrast, the peroxiredoxins Mpx and Tpx had only little impact on EMSH and H2O2 detoxification.

Cul1 rubylation is balanced by the COP9 signalosome (CSN), a multi-subunit derubylase that shows 1:1 paralogy to the 26S proteasome lid. The turnover of SCF substrates and their relevance to various diseases is well studied, yet, the extent by which environmental perturbations influence Cul1 rubylation/derubylation cycles per se is still unclear. In this study, we show that the level of cellular oxidation serves as a molecular switch, determining Cullin1 rubylation/derubylation ratio. We describe a mutant of the proteasome lid subunit, Rpn11 that exhibits accumulated levels of Cullin1-Rub1 conjugates, a characteristic phenotype of csn mutants. By dissecting between distinct phenotypes of rpn11 mutants, proteasome and mitochondria dysfunction, we were able to recognize the high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during the transition of cells into mitochondrial respiration, as a checkpoint of Cullin1 rubylation in a reversible manner. Thus, the study adds the rubylation cascade to the list of cellular pathways regulated by redox homeostasis.",

We sought to determine whether IDH2 deficiency induces mitochondrial dysfunction and modulates auditory function, and investigated the protective potential of an antioxidant agent against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cochlear damage in Idh2 knockout (Idh2\u2212/\u2212) mice. Idh2 deficiency leads to damages to hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) in the cochlea and ultimately to apoptotic cell death and progressive sensorineural hearing loss in Idh2\u2212/\u2212 mice. Loss of IDH2 activity led to decreased levels of NADPH and glutathione causing abnormal ROS accumulation and oxidative damage, which might trigger apoptosis signal in hair cells and SGNs in Idh2\u2212/\u2212 mice. We performed ex vivo experiments to determine whether administration of mitochondria-targeted antioxidants might protect or induce recovery of cells from ROS-induced apoptosis in Idh2-deficient mouse cochlea. MitoQ almost completely neutralized the H2O2-induced ototoxicity, as the survival rate of Idh2\u2212/\u2212 hair cells were restored to normal levels. In addition, the lack of IDH2 led to the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS and the depolarization of \u0394\u03a8m, resulting in hair cell loss. In the present study, we identified that IDH2 is indispensable for the functional maintenance and survival of hair cells and SGNs. Moreover, the hair cell degeneration caused by IDH2 deficiency can be prevented by MitoQ, which suggests that Idh2\u2212/\u2212 mice could be a valuable animal model for evaluating the therapeutic effects of various antioxidant candidates to overcome ROS-induced hearing loss.",

We applied this method to assess the effect of various urine workup procedures on the urinary concentrations of the oxidized nucleic acid products. Our results showed that frozen urine samples must be warmed (i.e., to 37\u202f\u00b0C) to re-dissolve any precipitates prior to analysis. We showed that common workup procedures, such as thawing at room temperature or dilution with deionized water, are not capable of releasing fully the oxidized nucleic acid products from the precipitates, and result in significant underestimation (up to ~\u202f100% for 8-oxoGua, ~\u202f86% for both 8-oxodGuo and 8-oxoGuo).With this method, we further assessed and compared the ability of the three oxidized nucleic acid products, as well as malondialdehyde (MDA, a product of lipid peroxidation), to biomonitor oxidative stress in vivo. We\u00a0measured a total of 315 urine samples from subjects with burdens of oxidative stress from low to high, including healthy subjects, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and patients on mechanical ventilation (MV). The results showed that both the MV and COPD patients had significantly higher urinary levels of 8-oxoGua, 8-oxodGuo, and 8-oxoGuo (P\u202f<\u202f0.001), but lower MDA levels, compared to healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that urinary 8-oxoGuo is the most sensitive biomarker for oxidative stress with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91, followed by 8-oxodGuo (AUC: 0.80) and 8-oxoGua (AUC: 0.76). Interestingly, MDA with AUC of 0.34 failed to discriminate the patients from healthy controls. Emerging evidence suggests a potential clinical utility for the measurement of urinary 8-oxoGuo, and to a lesser extent 8-oxodGuo, which is strongly supported by our findings.",

Two of the reaction products of methanethiol oxidation, hydrogen peroxide and hydrogen sulphide, serve as signalling molecules for cell differentiation. Indeed, colonocyte differentiation has been found to be associated with SELENBP1 induction. Here, we show that SELENBP1 is induced when 3T3-L1 preadipocytes undergo terminal differentiation and maturation to adipocytes. SELENBP1 induction succeeded the up-regulation of known marker proteins of white adipocytes and the intracellular accumulation of lipids. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed predominant cytoplasmic localisation of SELENBP1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as demonstrated by co-staining with the key lipogenic enzyme, acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC), located in cytosol. In differentiating 3T3-L1 cells, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) likewise suppressed SELENBP1 induction, adipocyte differentiation and lipid accumulation. However, lipid accumulation per se is not linked to SELENBP1 induction, as hepatic SELENBP1 was down-regulated in high fructose-fed mice despite increased lipogenesis in the liver and development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In conclusion, SELENBP1 is a marker of cell differentiation/maturation rather than being linked to lipogenesis/lipid accumulation.",

     "abstract": "Many current anti-cancer therapies rely on increasing the intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) contents with the aim to induce irreparable damage, which subsequently results in tumor cell death. A novel tool in cancer therapy is the use of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), which has been found to be very effective in the treatment of many different cancer cell types in vitro as well as in vivo, mainly through the vast generation of RONS. One of the key determinants of the cell's fate will be the interaction of RONS, generated by CAP, with important proteins, i.e. redox-regulatory proteins. One such protein is cytoglobin (CYGB), a recently discovered globin proposed to be involved in the protection of the cell against oxidative stress. In this study, the effect of plasma-produced RONS on CYGB was investigated through the treatment of CYGB with CAP for different treatment times. Spectroscopic analysis of CYGB showed that although chemical modifications occur, its secondary structure remains intact. Mass spectrometry experiments identified these modifications as oxidations of mainly sulfur-containing and aromatic amino acids. With longer treatment time, the treatment was also found to induce nitration of the heme. Furthermore, the two surface-exposed cysteine residues of CYGB were oxidized upon treatment, leading to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges, and potentially also intramolecular disulfide bridges. In addition, molecular dynamics and docking simulations confirmed, and further show, that the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, due to oxidative conditions, affects the CYGB 3D structure, thereby opening the access to the heme group, through gate functioning of His117. Altogether, the results obtained in this study (1) show that plasma-produced RONS can extensively oxidize proteins and (2) that the oxidation status of two redox-active cysteines lead to different conformations of CYGB.",

In addition, positive feedback regulation between Nrf2 and MT is required for the efficient compensative responses of the heart to IH. As an activator of Nrf2, sulforaphane (SFN) has attracted attention as a potential protective agent against cardiovascular disease. Here, we investigated whether SFN can up-regulate cardiac Nrf2 expression and function, as well as MT expression, to prevent IH-induced cardiomyopathy, and if so, whether Nrf2 and MT are indispensable for this preventive effect. Nrf2-knock-out (Nrf2-KO) or MT-KO mice and their wild-type (WT) equivalents were exposed to IH for 4 weeks with or without SFN treatment. SFN almost completely prevented IH-induced cardiomyopathy in WT mice, and this preventive effect was abolished in Nrf2-KO mice but retained in MT-KO mice. In IH-exposed WT mice, SFN induced significant increases in the expression levels of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant target genes, as well as those of MT, but these effects were not seen in IH-exposed Nrf2-KO mice. By contrast, KO of MT did not affect the ability of SFN to up-regulate the expression of Nrf2 and its downstream antioxidant targets. These results suggest that SFN-induced MT expression is Nrf2-dependent, and SFN prevents IH-induced cardiomyopathy in a Nrf2-dependent manner, for which MT is dispensable. This study provides important information that is relevant to the potential use of SFN to prevent IH-induced cardiomyopathy.",

The role of \u03b1TTP in the intracellular distribution of the different vitamin E forms is currently unknown. We therefore investigated the intracellular localization of \u03b1T, \u03b3-tocopherol (\u03b3T), \u03b1-tocotrienol (\u03b1T3), and \u03b3-tocotrienol (\u03b3T3) in cultured hepatic cells with and without stable expression of \u03b1TTP.

This, however, could perhaps also be due to an observed higher stability of tocotrienols, compared to tocopherols, in culture media rather than a higher absorption. We then incubated HepG2 cells and \u03b1TTP-expressing HepG2 cells with \u03b1T, \u03b3T, \u03b1T3, or \u03b3T3, isolated organelle fractions by density gradient centrifugation, and determined the concentrations of the congeners in the subcellular fractions. All four congeners were primarily associated with the lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, and plasma membrane, whereas only \u03b1T correlated with mitochondria. Neither the chromanol ring methylation or sidechain saturation, nor the expression of \u03b1TTP were important factors for the intracellular distribution of vitamin E.

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are central organelles to cellular metabolism. Their function relies largely on nuclear-encoded proteins that must be imported from the cytosol, and thus the protein import pathways are important for the maintenance of mitochondrial proteostasis. Mitochondrial HSP70 (mtHsp70) is a key component in facilitating the translocation of proteins through the inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix. Its protein folding cycle is regulated by the nucleotide-exchange factor GrpE, which triggers the release of folded proteins by ATP rebinding. Vertebrates have two mitochondrial GrpE paralogs, GRPEL1 and 2, but without clearly defined roles. Using BioID proximity labeling to identify potential binding partners of the GRPELs in the mitochondrial matrix, we obtained results supporting a model where both GRPELs regulate mtHsp70 as homodimers. We show that GRPEL2 is not essential in human cultured cells, and its absence does not prevent mitochondrial protein import. Instead we find that GRPEL2 is redox regulated in oxidative stress. In the presence of hydrogen peroxide, GRPEL2 forms dimers through intermolecular disulfide bonds in which Cys87 is the thiol switch. We propose that the dimerization of GRPEL2 may activate the folding machinery responsible for protein import into mitochondrial matrix or enhance the chaperone activity of mtHSP70, thus protecting mitochondrial proteostasis in oxidative stress.",

However, whether decreased glutathione precedes or follows neuronal dysfunction has not been unambiguously elucidated. Previous attempts to address this issue were approached by fully eliminating glutathione, a strategy causing abrupt lethality or premature neuronal death that led to multiple interpretations. To overcome this drawback, here we aimed to moderately decrease glutathione content by genetically knocking down the rate-limiting enzyme of glutathione biosynthesis in mouse neurons in vivo. Biochemical and morphological analyses of the brain revealed a modest glutathione decrease and redox stress throughout the hippocampus, although neuronal dendrite disruption and glial activation was confined to the hippocampal CA1 layer.

     "abstract": "DJ-1 is a highly conserved protein that protects neurons against oxidative stress and whose loss of function mutations are linked to recessively inherited Parkinson's disease (PD). While a number of signaling pathways have been shown to be regulated by DJ-1, its role in controlling cell survival through non-coding RNAs remains poorly understood. Here, using a microarray screen, we found that knocking down DJ-1 in human neuroblastoma cells results in down-regulation of microRNA-221 (miR-221). This is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the human brain and promotes neurite outgrowth and neuronal differentiation. Yet the molecular mechanism linking miR-221 to genetic forms of PD has not been studied. Consistent with the microarray data, miR-221 expression is also decreased in DJ-1-/- mouse brains. Re-introduction of wild-type DJ-1, but not its PD-linked pathogenic M26I mutant, restores miR-221 expression. Notably, over-expression of miR-221 is protective against 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced cell death, while inhibition of endogenous miR-221 sensitizes cells to this toxin. Additionally, miR-221 down-regulates the expression of several pro-apoptotic proteins at basal conditions and prevents oxidative\u00a0stress-induced up-regulation of bcl-2-like protein 11 (BIM). Accordingly, miR-221 protects differentiated DJ-1 knock-down ReNcell VM human dopaminergic neuronal cells from MPP+-induced neurite retraction and cell death. DJ-1 is a known activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and may modulate miR-221 levels in part through this pathway. We found that inhibiting ERK1/2 decreases miR-221 levels, whereas over-expressing ERK1 in DJ-1 knock-down cells increases miR-221 levels. These findings point to a new cytoprotective mechanism by which DJ-1 may increase miR-221 expression through the MAPK/ERK pathway, subsequently leading to repression of apoptotic molecules. The inability of a pathogenic DJ-1 mutant to modulate miR-221 further supports the relevance of this mechanism in neuronal health and its failure in DJ-1-linked PD.",

     "abstract": "The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) commonly occurs during normal aging and during some acute/chronic progressive disorders. In order to avoid oxidative damage, scavenging of these radicals is important. Previously, we identified zinc finger protein 179 (Znf179) as a neuroprotector that increases antioxidant enzymes against superoxide radicals. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the activation and regulation of Znf179 remain unresolved. Here, by performing sequence alignment, bioinformatics analysis, immunoprecipitation using two specific acetyl-lysine antibodies, and treatment with the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor SAHA, we determined the lysine-specific acetylation of Znf179. Furthermore, we investigated Znf179 interaction with HDACs and revealed that peroxide insult induced a dissociation of Znf179-HDAC1/HDAC6, causing an increase in Znf179 acetylation. Importantly, HDAC inhibition by SAHA further prompted Znf179 hyperacetylation, which promoted Znf179 to form a transcriptional complex with Sp1 and increased antioxidant gene expression against oxidative attack. In summary, the results obtained in this study showed that Znf179 was regulated by HDACs and that Znf179 acetylation was a critical mechanism in the induction of antioxidant defense systems. Additionally, HDAC inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for induction of Znf179 acetylation, strengthening the Znf179 protective functions against neurodegenerative processes.",

Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that oxidative injury is an important risk factor for endothelial cell damage. In addition, low folate levels are considered a contributing factor to promotion of vascular disease because of the deregulation of DNA methylation. We aimed to investigate the effects of folic acid on injuries induced by oxidative stress that occur via an epigenetic gene silencing mechanism in ApoE knockout mice fed a high-fat diet and in human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL). We assessed how folic acid influenced the levels of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG, an oxidative DNA damage marker) and cellular apoptosis in in vivo and in vitro models. Furthermore, we analyzed DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity, vascular peroxidase 1 (VPO1) expression, and promoter methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Our data showed that folic acid reduced 8-OHdG levels and decreased apoptosis in the aortic tissue of ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice. Likewise, our in vitro experiments showed that folic acid protects against endothelial dysfunction induced by ox-LDL by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS)-derived oxidative injuries, 8-OHdG content, and the apoptosis ratio. Importantly, this effect was indirectly caused by increased DNMT activity and altered DNA methylation at VPO1 promoters, as well as changes in the abundance of VPO1 expression. Collectively, we conclude that folic acid supplementation may prevent oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and suppresses ROS levels through downregulating VPO1 as a consequence of changes in DNA methylation, which may contribute to beneficial effects on endothelial function.",

Since hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has recently been involved in the non-nitric oxide (NO) non-prostanoid relaxations of intrarenal arteries, the present study was sought to investigate whether NADPH oxidases may be functional sources of vasodilator H2O2 in the kidney and to assess their role in the endothelium-dependent relaxations of human and rat intrarenal arteries. Renal interlobar arteries isolated from the kidney of renal tumor patients who underwent nephrectomy, and from the kidney of Wistar rats, were mounted in microvascular myographs to assess function. Superoxide (O2.-) and H2O2 production was measured by chemiluminescence and Amplex Red fluorescence, and Nox2 and Nox4 enzymes were detected by Western blotting and by double inmunolabeling along with eNOS. Nox2 and Nox4 proteins were expressed in the endothelium of renal arterioles and glomeruli co-localized with eNOS, levels of expression of both enzymes being higher in the cortex than in isolated arteries. Pharmacological inhibition of Nox with apocynin and of CYP 2C epoxygenases with sulfaphenazol, but not of the NO synthase (NOS), reduced renal NADPH-stimulated O2.- and H2O2 production. Under conditions of cyclooxygenase and NOS blockade, acetylcholine induced endothelium-dependent relaxations that were blunted by the non-selective Nox inhibitor apocynin and by the Nox2 or the Nox1/4 inhibitors gp91ds-tat and GKT136901, respectively. Acetylcholine stimulated H2O2 production that was reduced by gp91ds-tat and by GKT136901. These results suggest the specific involvement of Nox4 and Nox2 subunits as physiologically relevant endothelial sources of H2O2 generation that contribute to the endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of renal arteries and therefore have a protective role in kidney vasculature.",

While the fundamental causes of the disease are still unclear, the accumulation of Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) immunoreactive aggregates is associated with familial ALS cases. Cholesterol 5,6-secosterol aldehydes (Seco A and Seco B) are reported to contribute to neurodegenerative disease pathology by inducing protein modification and aggregation. Here we have investigated the presence of secosterol aldehydes in ALS SOD1-G93A rats and their capacity to induce SOD1 aggregation. Secosterol aldehydes were analyzed in blood plasma, spinal cord and motor cortex of ALS rats at the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages. Seco B was significantly increased in plasma of symptomatic ALS rats compared to pre-symptomatic animals, suggesting an association with disease progression. In vitro experiments showed that both Seco A and Seco B induce the formation of high molecular weight (HMW) SOD1 aggregates with amorphous morphology. SOD1 adduction to \u03c9-alkynyl-secosterols analyzed by click assay showed that modified proteins are only detected in the HMW region, indicating that secosterol adduction generates species highly prone to aggregate. Of note, SOD1-secosterol adducts containing up to five secosterol molecules were confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis. Interestingly, mass spectrometry sequencing of SOD1 aggregates revealed preferential secosterol adduction to Lys residues located at the electrostatic loop (Lys 122, 128 and 136) and nearby the dimer interface (Lys 3 and 9). Altogether, our results show that secosterol aldehydes are increased in plasma of symptomatic ALS rats and represent a class of aldehydes that can potentially modify SOD1 enhancing its propensity to aggregate.",

However, these genetic factors are either absent or rendered non-functional in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Therefore, how Mtb organizes genome architecture and regulates gene expression to counterbalance oxidative imbalance is unknown. Here, we report that an intracellular redox-sensor, WhiB4, dynamically links genome condensation and oxidative stress response in Mtb. Disruption of WhiB4 affects the expression of genes involved in maintaining redox homeostasis, central metabolism, and respiration under oxidative stress. Notably, disulfide-linked oligomerization of WhiB4 in response to oxidative stress activates the protein\u2019s ability to condense DNA. Further, overexpression of WhiB4 led to hypercondensation of nucleoids, redox imbalance and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, whereas WhiB4 disruption reversed this effect. In accordance with the findings in vitro, ChIP-Seq data demonstrated non-specific binding of WhiB4 to GC-rich regions of the Mtb genome. Lastly, data indicate that WhiB4 deletion affected the expression of ~ 30% of genes preferentially bound by the protein, suggesting both direct and indirect effects on gene expression. We propose that WhiB4 structurally couples Mtb\u2019s response to oxidative stress with genome organization and transcription.",

To better understand the relationship between RPL10 and tumorigenic potential in pancreatic cancer cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing reveals that RPL10 is unlikely to be a transcription factor without a specific binding motif for gene transcription. Additionally, transcriptome analysis indicates that RPL10 could regulate the expression of proteins related to ROS production. Moreover, RPL10 in mitochondria is closely associated with the regulation of ROS level by affecting Complex I activity and the subsequent events. Together, the present study suggests that the regulation of ROS level by mitochondrial RPL10 is one of the major extra-ribosomal functions in pancreatic cancer cells, which could be used as an indicator for the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer.",

     "abstract": "Atherosclerosis remains the number one cause of death and disability worldwide. Atherosclerosis is treated by revascularization procedures to restore blood flow to distal tissue, but these procedures often fail due to restenosis secondary to neointimal hyperplasia. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder that accelerates both atherosclerosis development and onset of restenosis. Strategies to inhibit restenosis aim at reducing neointimal hyperplasia by inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and migration. Since increased production of reactive oxygen species promotes VSMC proliferation and migration, redox intervention to maintain vascular wall redox homeostasis holds the potential to inhibit arterial restenosis. Cinnamic aldehyde (CA) is an electrophilic Nrf2 activator that has shown therapeutic promise in diabetic rodent models. Nrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates the antioxidant response. Therefore, we hypothesized that CA would activate Nrf2 and would inhibit neointimal hyperplasia after carotid artery balloon injury in the Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rat. In primary ZDF VSMC, CA inhibited cell growth by MTT with an EC50 of 118\u202f\u00b1\u202f7\u202f\u03bcM. At a therapeutic dose of 100\u202f\u03bcM, CA inhibited proliferation of ZDF VSMC in vitro and reduced the proliferative index within the injured artery in vivo, as well as migration of ZDF VSMC in vitro. CA activated the Nrf2 pathway in both ZDF VSMC and injured carotid arteries while also increasing antioxidant defenses and reducing markers of redox dysfunction. Additionally, we noted a significant reduction of neutrophils (69%) and macrophages (78%) within the injured carotid arteries after CA treatment. Lastly, CA inhibited neointimal hyperplasia evidenced by a 53% reduction in the intima:media ratio and a 61% reduction in vessel occlusion compared to arteries treated with vehicle alone. Overall CA was capable of activating Nrf2, and inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia after balloon injury in a rat model of diabetic restenosis.",

     "abstract": "High myopia is recognized as a risk factor for earlier onset of nuclear cataracts. One possible explanation for this is that lenses in highly myopic eyes are exposed to higher levels of oxygen than normal eyes owing to earlier vitreous liquefaction and, hence, are subjected to oxidative insults. Here, we first compared the methylation levels of six essential antioxidant genes (GSTP1, NRF2, OGG1, TXN, TXNRD1 and TXNRD2) between highly myopic cataract (HMC) and age-related cataract (ARC) lens epithelial samples via Sequenom MassARRAY. We found that specific CpG units in the promoters of GSTP1 and TXNRD2 were hypermethylated and that the expression levels of these two genes were lower in the HMC group than in the ARC group. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed the significance of differentially methylated fragments in the activation of transcription. The importance of GSTP1 and TXNRD2 in antioxidant capacity was confirmed by overexpression or knockdown experiments on cultured lens epithelial cells (LECs). In addition, the expression of DNA methyl transferase 1 (DNMT1) was higher in the lens epithelium of HMC patients than that of ARC patients, and the expression of GSTP1 and TXNRD2 was upregulated by use of a DNMT inhibitor in cultured LECs.

Therefore, we propose that in an environment with high oxygen, in which lenses in highly myopic eyes are immersed, there exists a vicious cycle composed of increased oxidative stress and decreased enzymatic antioxidants via the hypermethylation of antioxidant genes.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress under pathological conditions, such as ischemia/reperfusion and inflammation, results in the production of various reactive chemicals. Of these chemicals, 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a peroxidation product of \u03c96-polyunsaturated fatty acid, has garnered significant attention. However, the effect of 4-HNE on cardiac electrophysiology has not yet been reported. In the present study, we investigated the effects of 4-HNE on several cardiac ion channels, including human ether-a-go-go-related (hERG) channels, using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Short-term exposure to 100\u202f\u03bcM 4-HNE (4-HNE100S), which mimics local levels under oxidative stress, decreased the amplitudes of rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current (IKr) in guinea pig ventricular myocytes (GPVMs) and HEK293T cells overexpressing hERG (IhERG). MS analysis revealed the formation of 4-HNE-hERG adduct on specific amino acid residues, including C276, K595, H70, and H687. Long-term treatment (1\u20133\u202fh) with 10\u202f\u03bcM 4-HNE (4-HNE10L), suppressed IKr and IhERG, but not IKs and ICa,L. Action potential duration (APD) of GPVMs was prolonged by 37% and 64% by 4-HNE100S and 4-HNE10L, respectively. Western blot analysis using surface biotinylation revealed a reduction in mature membrane hERG protein after treatment with 4-HNE10L. Proteasomal degradation inhibitors, such as bortezomib, prevented the 4-HNE10L-induced decrease in mature hERG, suggesting a retrograde degradation of membrane hERG due to 4-HNE. Taken together, 4-HNE100S and 4-HNE10L suppressed IhERG via functional inhibition and downregulation of membrane expression of hERG, respectively. The exposure of 4-HNE under pathological oxidative stress may increase the risk of proarrhythmic events via APD prolongation.",

We demonstrate this principle by monitoring the activation of extrinsic, intrinsic and effector caspases upon apoptotic stimulus.

Human fetal hemoglobin (HbF), similarly to the adult hemoglobin (HbA), carries redox active \u03b3Cys93 in the vicinity of the heme pocket. Site-directed mutagenesis has been used in this study to examine the impact of removal and/or addition of cysteine residues in HbF. The redox activities of the recombinant mutants were examined by determining the spontaneous autoxidation rate, the hydrogen peroxide induced ferric to ferryl oxidation rate, and irreversible oxidation of cysteine by quantitative mass spectrometry. We found that substitution of \u03b3Cys93Ala resulted in oxidative instability characterized by increased oxidation rates. Moreover, the addition of a cysteine residue at \u03b119 on the exposed surface of the \u03b1-chain altered the regular electron transfer pathway within the protein by forming an alternative oxidative site. This may also create an accessible site for di-sulfide bonding between Hb subunits.

With the development of the genetically encoded photosensitiser KillerRed (KR) it is now possible to efficiently produce ROS dose-dependently in a specific cell type upon green light illumination. Zebrafish are the ideal vertebrate animal model for these optogenetic methods because of their transparency and efficient transgenesis. Here we describe a zebrafish model that expresses membrane-targeted KR selectively in motor neurons. We show that KR-activated neurons in the spinal cord undergo stress and cell death after induction of ROS. Using single-cell resolution and time-lapse confocal imaging, we selectively induced neurodegeneration in KR-expressing neurons leading to characteristic signs of apoptosis and cell death. We furthermore illustrate a targeted microglia response to the induction site as part of a physiological response within the zebrafish spinal cord. Our data demonstrate the successful implementation of KR mediated ROS toxicity in motor neurons in vivo and has important implications for studying the effects of ROS in a variety of conditions within the central nervous system, including aging and age-related neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.",

     "abstract": "NRF2 is a redox-responsive transcription factor that regulates expression of cytoprotective genes via its interaction with DNA sequences known as antioxidant response elements (AREs). NRF2 activity is induced by oxidative stress, but oxidative stress is not the only context in which NRF2 can be activated. Mutations that disrupt the interaction between NRF2 and KEAP1, an inhibitor of NRF2, lead to NRF2 hyperactivation and promote oncogenesis. The mechanisms underlying NRF2's oncogenic properties remain unclear, but likely involve aberrant expression of select NRF2 target genes. We tested this possibility using an integrative genomics approach to get a precise view of the direct NRF2 target genes dysregulated in tumors with NRF2 hyperactivating mutations. This approach revealed a core set of 32 direct NRF2 targets that are consistently upregulated in NRF2 hyperactivated tumors. This set of NRF2 \u201ccancer target genes\u201d includes canonical redox-related NRF2 targets, as well as target genes that have not been previously linked to NRF2 activation. Importantly, NRF2-driven upregulation of this gene set is largely independent of the organ system where the tumor developed. One key distinguishing feature of these NRF2 cancer target genes is that they are regulated by high affinity AREs that fall within genomic regions possessing a ubiquitously permissive chromatin signature. This implies that these NRF2 cancer target genes are responsive to oncogenic NRF2 in most tissues because they lack the regulatory constraints that restrict expression of most other NRF2 target genes. This NRF2 cancer target gene set also serves as a reliable proxy for NRF2 activity, and high NRF2 activity is associated with significant decreases in survival in multiple cancer types. Overall, the pervasive upregulation of these NRF2 cancer targets across multiple cancers, and their association with negative outcomes, suggests that these will be central to dissecting the functional implications of NRF2 hyperactivation in several cancer contexts.",

Recent evidence has shown that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), produced by the enzyme cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE), improves the cardiac function in heart failure. However, the cellular mechanisms for this remain largely unknown. The present study was conducted to determine the functional role of H2S in protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction in heart failure through the inhibition of CaMKII using wild type and CSE knockout mouse models.Treatment with S-propyl-L-cysteine (SPRC) or sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS), modulators of blood H2S levels, attenuated the development of heart failure in animals, reduced lipid peroxidation, and preserved mitochondrial function. The inhibition CaMKII phosphorylation by SPRC and NaHS as demonstrated using both in vivo and in vitro models corresponded with the cardioprotective effects of these compounds. Interestingly, CaMKII activity was found to be elevated in CSE knockout (CSE-/-) mice as compared to wild type animals and the phosphorylation status of CaMKII appeared to relate to the severity of heart failure. Importantly, in wild type mice SPRC was found to promote S-sulfhydration of CaMKII leading to reduced activity of this protein, however, in CSE-/- mice S-sulfhydration was abolished following SPRC treatment.A novel mechanism depicting a role of S-sulfhydration in the regulation of CaMKII is presented. SPRC mediated S-sulfhydration of CaMKII was found to inhibit CAMKII activity and to preserve cardiovascular homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "Artesunate (ART) is a prominent anti-malarial with significant anti-cancer properties. Our previous studies showed that ART enhances lysosomal function and ferritin degradation, which was necessary for its anti-cancer properties. ART targeting to mitochondria also significantly improved its efficacy, but the effect of ART on mitophagy, an important cellular pathway that facilitates the removal of damaged mitochondria, remains unknown. Here, we first observed that ART mainly localizes in the mitochondria and its probe labeling revealed that it binds to a large number of mitochondrial proteins and causes mitochondrial fission. Second, we found that ART treatment leads to autophagy induction and the decrease of mitochondrial proteins. When autophagy is inhibited, the decrease of mitochondrial proteins could be reversed, indicating that the degradation of mitochondrial proteins is through mitophagy. Third, our results showed that ART treatment stabilizes the full-length form of PTEN induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) on the mitochondria and activates the PINK1-dependent pathway. This in turn leads to the recruitment of Parkin, sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1), ubiquitin and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) to the mitochondria and culminates in mitophagy. When PINK1 is knocked down, ART-induced mitophagy is markedly suppressed. Finally, we investigated the effect of mitophagy by ART on mitochondrial functions and found that knockdown of PINK1 alters the cellular redox status in ART-treated cells, which is accompanied with a significant decrease in glutathione (GSH) and increase in mitochondrial reactive oxidative species (mROS) and cellular lactate levels. Additionally, knockdown of PINK1 leads to a significant increase of mitochondrial depolarization and more cell apoptosis by ART, suggesting that mitophagy protects from ART-induced cell death. Taken together, our findings reveal the molecular mechanism that ART induces cytoprotective mitophagy through the PINK1-dependent pathway, suggesting that mitophagy inhibition could enhance the anti-cancer activity of ART.",

Our previous findings indicate that AD fibroblasts show specific defects in mitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics, which affects the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Therefore, we explored the possible mechanisms involved in this mitochondrial failure. We found that compared with normal fibroblasts, AD fibroblasts had mitochondrial calcium dysregulation. Further, AD fibroblasts showed a persistent activation of the non-specific mitochondrial calcium channel, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Moreover, the pharmacological blockage of mPTP with Cyclosporine A (CsA) prevented the increase of mitochondrial superoxide levels, and significantly improved mitochondrial and cytosolic calcium dysregulation in AD fibroblasts. Finally, despite the failure of CsA to improve ATP levels, the inhibition of mitochondrial calcium uptake by the mitochondrial calcium uniporter increased ATP production in AD fibroblasts, indicating that these two mechanisms may contribute to mitochondrial failure in AD fibroblasts. These findings suggest that peripheral cells present similar signs of mitochondrial dysfunction observed in the brain of AD patients. Therefore, our work creates possibilities of new targets to study for early diagnosis of the AD.",

Here, we generated and analyzed Gjb2+/\u2212 mice as a model of heterozygous human carriers of 35delG. Compared to control mice, auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) worsened over time more rapidly in Gjb2+/\u2212 mice, indicating they were affected by accelerated age-related hearing loss (ARHL), or presbycusis. We linked causally the auditory phenotype of Gjb2+/\u2212 mice to apoptosis and oxidative damage in the cochlear duct, reduced release of glutathione from connexin hemichannels, decreased nutrient delivery to the sensory epithelium via cochlear gap junctions and deregulated expression of genes that are under transcriptional control of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a pivotal regulator of tolerance to redox stress.

Indeed, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27HC), physiologically produced by enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol, act as inhibitors of a wide spectrum of enveloped and non-enveloped human viruses. However, the mechanisms underlying their protective effects against non-enveloped viruses are almost completely unexplored. To get insight into this field, we investigated the antiviral activity of 25HC and 27HC against a non-enveloped virus causing acute gastroenteritis in children, the human rotavirus (HRV). We found that 25HC and 27HC block the infectivity of several HRV strains at 50% inhibitory concentrations in the low micromolar range in the absence of cell toxicity. Both molecules affect the final step of virus penetration into cells by preventing the association of two cellular proteins: the oxysterol binding protein (OSBP) and the vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein-A (VAP-A). By altering the activity of these cellular mediators, 25HC and 27HC disturb the recycling of cholesterol between the endoplasmic reticulum and the late endosomes which are exploited by HRV to penetrate into the cell. The substantial accumulation of cholesterol in the late endosomal compartment results in sequestering viral particles inside these vesicles thereby preventing cytoplasmic virus replication. These findings suggest that cholesterol oxidation products of enzymatic origin might be primary effectors of host restriction strategies to counteract HRV infection and point to redox active lipids involvement in viral infections as a research area of focus to better focus in order to identify novel antiviral agents targets.",

Our novel studies indicate that Se levels positively influence Nrf2 activation and selenoenzyme responses following TXNRD1 inhibition. These data suggest that Se status significantly influences physiologic responses to TXNRD1 inhibitors. In conclusion, correction of clinical Se deficiency, if present, will be necessary for optimal therapeutic effectiveness of TXNRD1 inhibitors in the prevention of lung disease.",

     "abstract": "Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration contributes largely to pathoanatomical and degenerative changes of spinal structure that increase the risk of low back pain. Apoptosis in nucleus pulposus (NP) can aggravate IVD degeneration, and increasing studies have shown that interventions targeting NP cell apoptosis can ameliorate IVD degeneration, exhibiting their potential for use as therapeutic strategies. Recent data have shown that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) accumulate in NP tissues in parallel with the progression of IVD degeneration and form a microenvironment of oxidative stress. This study examined whether AGEs accumulation aggravates NP cell apoptosis and IVD degeneration, and explored the mechanisms underlying these effects. We observed that the viability and proliferation of human NP cells were significantly suppressed by AGEs treatment, mainly due to apoptosis. Furthermore, activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was detected after AGEs treatment. In addition, the molecular data showed that AGEs could significantly aggravate the generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and prolonged activation of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, as well as the increased level of Bax protein and decreased level of Bcl-2 protein in mitochondria. These effects could be reduced by antioxidant (2-(2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl-4-ylamino)-2-oxoethyl) triphenylphosphonium chloride (MitoTEMPO) and Visomitin (SKQ1). Importantly, we identified that impairment of Sirtuin3 (SIRT3) function and the mitochondrial antioxidant network were vital mechanisms in AGEs-induced oxidative stress and secondary human NP cell apoptosis. Finally, based on findings that nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) could restore SIRT3 function and rescue human NP cell apoptosis through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 coactivator 1\u03b1 (AMPK-PGC-1\u03b1) pathway in vitro, we confirmed its protective effect on AGEs-induced IVD degeneration in vivo. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that SIRT3 protects against AGEs-induced human NP cell apoptosis and IVD degeneration. Targeting SIRT3 to improve mitochondrial redox homeostasis may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for attenuating AGEs-associated IVD degeneration.",

     "abstract": "Non-exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is mainly caused by the accumulation of lipofuscin and drusen on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Both oxidative stress and autophagic dysfunction accelerate the deposition of lipofuscin at the RPE. One of the key regulators in the response against oxidative stress is the NF-E2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2)-kelch like ECH associated protein 1 (Keap1) axis, which is also closely associated with the autophagy pathway. Nrf2 activation upregulates the expression levels of certain anti-oxidative enzymes [e.g. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)], which attenuates oxidative damage. However, until now, the relationship between cytoprotective effects of Nrf2 activation and autophagic degradation remain unclear. To address these questions, we investigated the effects of a novel Nrf2 activator, RS9, on RPE damage. We found that RS9 protected ARPE-19 cells against NaIO3-induced oxidative damage, and that the protective effects of RS9 were inhibited by co-treatment with zinc protoporphyrin, an HO-1 inhibitor. Next, we examined the involvement of autophagic degradation in the protective effects of RS9. Co-treatment with RS9 and chloroquine, a lysosomal acidification inhibitor, inhibited the protective effect. Furthermore, western blotting and immunostaining showed that RS9 accelerated autophagy flux and induced transient upregulation of p62 [also known as sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)]. Co-treatment with chloroquine and RS9 also inhibited the degradation of autophagosomes. Transient upregulation of SQSTM1 by RS9 was unaltered by HO-1 knockdown using siRNA. RS9 and chloroquine had the same actions in light damaged adult zebrafish retina as those in vitro. In conclusion, we clarified the relationship between acceleration of the autophagy pathway and the cytoprotective effects of Nrf2 activation in RPE cells and zebrafish retina. These findings indicated that Nrf2 activation could be a promising therapeutic approach for non-exudative AMD by supporting RPE maintenance.",

     "abstract": "The N-terminal acetyltransferase A (NatA) complex, which is composed of NAA10 and NAA15, catalyzes N-terminal acetylation of many proteins in a co-translational manner. Structurally, the catalytic subunit NAA10 was believed to have no activity toward an internal lysine residue because the gate of its catalytic pocket is too narrow. However, several studies have demonstrated that the monomeric NAA10 can acetylate the internal lysine residues of several substrates including hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1). How NAA10 acetylates lysine residues has been an unsolved question. We here found that human FIH (factor inhibiting HIF) hydroxylates human NAA10 at W38 oxygen-dependently and this permits NAA10 to express the lysyl-acetyltransferase activity. The hydroxylated W38 forms a new hydrogen-bond with A67 and widens the gate at the catalytic pocket, which allows the entrance of a lysine residue to the site. Since the FIH-dependent hydroxylation of NAA10 occurs oxygen-dependently, NAA10 acetylates HIF-1\u03b1 under normoxia but does not under hypoxia. Consequently, the acetylation promotes the pVHL binding to HIF-1\u03b1, and in turn HIF-1\u03b1 is destructed via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This study provides a novel oxygen-sensing process that determines the substrate specificity of NAA10 depending on an ambient oxygen tension.",

     "abstract": "It is generally recognized that hepatic fibrogenesis is an end result of increased extracellular matrix (ECM) production from the activation and proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). An in-depth understanding of the mechanisms of HSC necroptosis might provide a new therapeutic strategy for prevention and treatment of hepatic fibrosis. In this study, we attempted to investigate the effect of curcumol on necroptosis in HSCs, and further to explore the molecular mechanisms. We found that curcumol ameliorated the carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced mice liver fibrosis and suppressed HSC proliferation and activation, which was associated with regulating HSC necroptosis through increasing the phosphorylation of receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3). Moreover, curcumol promoted the migration of RIPK1 and RIPK3 into necrosome in HSCs. RIPK3 depletion impaired the anti-fibrotic effect of curcumol. Importantly, we showed that curcumol-induced RIPK3 up-regulation significantly increased mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial depolarization. ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) impaired RIPK3-mediated necroptosis. In addition, our study also identified that the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase1/2 (JNK1/2) was regulated by RIPK3, which mediated curcumol-induced ROS production. Down-regulation of RIPK3 expression, using siRIPK3, markedly abrogated JNK1/2 expression. The use of specific JNK1/2 inhibitor (SP600125) resulted in the suppression of curcumol-induced ROS production and mitochondrial depolarization, which in turn, contributed to the inhibition of curcumol-triggered necroptosis. In summary, our study results reveal the molecular mechanism of curcumol-induced HSC necroptosis, and suggest a potential clinical use of curcumol-targeted RIPK1/RIPK3 complex-dependent necroptosis via JNK1/2-ROS signaling for the treatment of hepatic fibrosis.",

     "abstract": "Fibronectin (FN) occurs as both a soluble form, in plasma and at sites of tissue injury, and a cellular form in tissue extracellular matrices (ECM). FN is critical to wound repair, ECM structure and assembly, cell adhesion and proliferation. FN is reported to play a critical role in the development, progression and stability of cardiovascular atherosclerotic lesions, with high FN levels associated with a thick fibrotic cap, stable disease and a low risk of rupture. Evidence has been presented for FN modification by inflammatory oxidants, and particularly myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived species including hypochlorous acid (HOCl). The targets and consequences of FN modification are poorly understood. Here we show, using a newly-developed MS protocol, that HOCl and an enzymatic MPO system, generate site-specific dose-dependent Tyr chlorination and dichlorination (up to 16 of 100 residues modified), and oxidation of Trp (7 of 39 residues), Met (3 of 26) and His (1 of 55) within selected FN domains, and particularly the heparin- and cell-binding regions. These alterations increase FN binding to heparin-containing columns. Studies using primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (HCASMC) show that exposure to HOCl-modified FN, results in decreased adherence, increased proliferation and altered expression of genes involved in ECM synthesis and remodelling. These findings indicate that the presence of modified fibronectin may play a major role in the formation, development and stabilisation of fibrous caps in atherosclerotic lesions and may play a key role in the switching of quiescent contractile smooth muscle cells to a migratory, synthetic and proliferative phenotype.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are a byproduct of oxidative metabolism, serve as signaling molecules in a number of physiological settings. However, if their levels are not tightly maintained, excess ROS lead to potentially cytotoxic oxidative stress. Accordingly, several transcriptional regulatory networks have evolved to include components that are highly ROS-responsive. Depending on the context, these regulatory networks can leverage ROS to respond to nutrient conditions, metabolism, or other physiological signals, or to respond to oxidative stress. However, ROS signaling is complex, so regulatory interactions between various ROS-responsive transcription factors are still being mapped out. Here we show that the transcription factor NRF2, a key regulator of the adaptive response to oxidative stress, directly regulates expression of HIF1A, which encodes HIF1\u03b1, a key transcriptional regulator of the adaptive response to hypoxia. We used an integrative genomics approach to identify HIF1A as a ROS-responsive transcript and we found an NRF2-bound antioxidant response element (ARE) approximately 30 kilobases upstream of HIF1A. This ARE sequence is deeply conserved, and we verified that it is directly bound and activated by NRF2. In addition, we found that HIF1A is upregulated in breast and bladder tumors with high NRF2 activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NRF2 targets a functional ARE at the HIF1A locus, and reveal a direct regulatory connection between two important oxygen responsive transcription factors.",

However, no experimental evidence supports a role for Mstn in cancer, particularly in regulating the survival and growth of cancer cells. In this study, we showed that the expression of Mstn was significantly increased in different tumor tissues and human cancer cells. Mstn knockdown inhibited the proliferation of cancer cells. A knockout (KO) of Mstn created by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) 9 (CRISPR/Cas9) induced mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in HeLa cells. Furthermore, KO of Mstn reduced the lipid content. Molecular analyses demonstrated that the expression levels of fatty acid oxidation-related genes were upregulated and then increased rate of fatty acid oxidation. Mstn deficiency-induced apoptosis took place along with generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevated fatty acid oxidation, which may play a role in triggering mitochondrial membrane depolarization, the release of cytochrome c (Cyt-c), and caspase activation. Importantly, apoptosis induced by Mstn KO was partially rescued by antioxidants and etomoxir, thereby suggesting that the increased level of ROS was functionally involved in mediating apoptosis. Overall, our findings demonstrate a novel function of Mstn in regulating mitochondrial metabolism and apoptosis within cancer cells. Hence, inhibiting the production and function of Mstn may be an effective therapeutic intervention during cancer progression and muscle loss in cachexia.",

Elevated reactive oxygen species production, commonly associated with ischemic injury, has been shown to promote phosphorylation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), a critical regulator of angiogenesis. Previous data from our lab demonstrated that diminished levels of the antioxidant glutathione positively augment ischemic angiogenesis. Here, we sought to determine the relationship between glutathione levels and oxidative stress in VEGFR2 signaling. We reveal that decreasing the ratio of GSH to GSSG with diamide leads to enhanced protein S-glutathionylation, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and enhanced VEGFR2 activation. However, increasing ROS alone was insufficient in activating VEGFR2, while ROS enhanced VEGF-stimulated VEGFR2 activation at supraphysiological levels. We also found that inhibiting glutathione reductase activity is sufficient to increase VEGFR2 activation and sensitizes cells to ROS-dependent VEGFR2 activation. Taken together, these data suggest that regulation of the cellular GSH:GSSG ratio critically regulates VEGFR2 activation.

     "abstract": "Although electrophiles are considered as detrimental to cells, accumulating recent evidence indicates that proliferating non-cancerous and particularly cancerous cells utilize these agents for pro-survival and cell cycle promoting signaling. Hence, the redox shift to mild oxidant release must be balanced by multiple defense mechanisms. Our latest findings demonstrate that cell cycle progression, which dictates oxidant level in stress-free conditions, determines PARP1 transcription. Growth modulating factors regulate CDK4/6-RBs-E2Fs axis. In cells arrested in G1 and G0, RB1-E2F1 and RBL2-E2F4 dimers recruit chromatin remodelers such as HDAC1, SWI/SNF and PRC2 to condense chromatin and turn off transcription. Release of retinoblastoma-based repressive complexes from E2F-dependent gene promoters in response to cell transition to S phase enables transcription of PARP1. This enzyme contributes to repair of oxidative DNA damage by supporting several strand break repair pathways and nucleotide or base excision repair pathways, as well as acting as a co-activator of transcription factors such as NRF2 and HIF1a, which control expression of antioxidant enzymes involved in removal of electrophiles and secondary metabolites. Furthermore, PARP1 is indispensible for transcription of the pro-survival kinases MAP2K6, ERK1/2 and AKT1, and for maintaining MAPK activity by suppressing transcription of the MAPK inhibitor, MPK1. In summary, cell cycle controlled PARP1 transcription helps cells to adapt to a pro-oxidant redox shift.",

Therefore, the nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a key regulator of the antioxidative response, is considered to be important as a therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases. We investigated the underlying mechanism of Nrf2-mediated neuroprotective effects against oxidative stress in the PC12 cell line by 7\u03b2-(3-ethyl-cis-crotonoyloxy)-1\u03b1-(2-methylbutyryloxy)-3,14-dehydro-Z-notonipetranone (ECN), one of the sesquiterpenoids in Farfarae Flos. Pretreatment of PC12 cells with ECN had a protective effect against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)- or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced cytotoxicity. ECN upregulated the ARE-luciferase activity and induced the mRNA expression of Nrf2 and antioxidant enzyme heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Knockdown of Nrf2 by small, interfering RNA (siRNA) abrogated the upregulation of HO-1, indicating that ECN had induced HO-1 via the Nrf2 pathway. Pretreatment with the thiol reducing agents, N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or dithiothreitol (DTT), attenuated Nrf2 activation and HO-1 expression. However, the non-thiol reducing antioxidant, Trolox, failed to inhibit HO-1 induction by ECN. These results suggest that ECN may directly interact with Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and modify critical cysteine thiols present in the proteins responsible for Nrf2-mediated upregulation of HO-1. In a 6-OHDA-induced mouse model of PD, administration of ECN ameliorated motor impairments and dopaminergic neuronal damage. Taken together, ECN exerts neuroprotective effects by activating the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway in both PC12 cells and mice. Thus, ECN, as an Nrf2 activator, could be an attractive therapeutic candidate for the neuroprotection or treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

This work investigated if supplementation with the anthocyanidins (AC) cyanidin and delphinidin could attenuate the adverse consequences of consuming a high fat diet (HFD) in mice. Consumption of an AC-rich blend mitigated HFD-induced obesity, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance (impaired responses to insulin and glucose). HFD-fed mice were characterized by increased liver lipid deposition and inflammation, which were also attenuated upon AC supplementation. HFD caused liver oxidative stress showing an increased expression of NADPH oxidases, generators of superoxide and H2O2, and high levels of oxidized lipid-protein adducts. This was associated with the activation of the redox sensitive signals IKK/NF-\u03baB and JNK1/2, and increased expression of the NF-\u03baB-regulated PTP1B phosphatase, all known inhibitors of the insulin pathway. In agreement with an improved insulin sensitivity, AC supplementation inhibited oxidative stress, NF-\u03baB and JNK activation, and PTP1B overexpression. Thus, cyanidin and delphinidin consumption either through diet or by supplementation could be a positive strategy to control the adverse effects of Western style diets, including overweight, obesity, and T2D.

     "abstract": "Mitochondria supply ~90% of the ATP required for contractile function in cardiac cells. While adult cardiomyocytes preferentially utilize fatty acids as a fuel source for oxidative phosphorylation, cardiac mitochondria can switch to other substrates when required. This change is driven in part by a combination of extracellular and intracellular signal transduction pathways that alter mitochondrial gene expression and enzymatic activity. The mechanisms by which extracellular metabolic information is conveyed to cardiac mitochondria are not currently well defined. Recent work has shown that adropin \u2013 a liver-secreted peptide hormone \u2013 can induce changes in mitochondrial fuel substrate utilization in skeletal muscle, leading to increased glucose use. In this study, we examined whether adropin could regulate mitochondrial glucose utilization pathways in cardiac cells. We show that stimulation of cultured cardiac cells with adropin leads to decreased expression of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) negative regulator PDK4, which reduces inhibitory PDH phosphorylation. The downregulation of PDK4 expression by adropin is lost when GPR19 \u2013 a putative adropin receptor \u2013 is genetically depleted in H9c2 cells. Loss of GRP19 expression alone increased PDK4 expression, leading to a reduction in mitochondrial respiration. Finally, we show that adropin-mediated GPR19 signaling relies on the p44/42 MAPK pathway, and that pharmacological disruption of this pathway blocks the effects of adropin on PDK4 in cardiac cells. These findings suggest that adropin may be a key regulator of fuel substrate utilization in the heart, and implicates an orphan G-protein coupled receptor in a novel signaling pathway controlling mitochondrial fuel metabolism.",

     "abstract": "Anti-cancer effects of local anesthetics have been reported but the mode of action remains elusive. Here, we examined the bioenergetic and REDOX impact of levobupivacaine on human prostate cancer cells (DU145) and corresponding non-cancer primary human prostate cells (BHP). Levobupivacaine induced a combined inhibition of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells, resulting in a reduced cellular ATP production and consecutive bioenergetic crisis, along with reactive oxygen species generation. The dose-dependent inhibition of respiratory chain complex I activity by levobupivacaine explained the alteration of mitochondrial energy fluxes. Furthermore, the potency of levobupivacaine varied with glucose and oxygen availability as well as the cellular energy demand, in accordance with a bioenergetic anti-cancer mechanism. The levobupivacaine-induced bioenergetic crisis triggered cytostasis in prostate cancer cells as evidenced by a S-phase cell cycle arrest, without apoptosis induction. In DU145 cells, levobupivacaine also triggered the induction of autophagy and blockade of this process potentialized the anti-cancer effect of the local anesthetic. Therefore, our findings provide a better characterization of the REDOX mechanisms underpinning the anti-effect of levobupivacaine against human prostate cancer cells.",

Recent data showed that 8-oxoG not only is a pro-mutagenic genomic base lesion, but also functions as an epigenetic mark and that consequently OGG1 acquire distinct roles in modulation of gene expression. In support, lack of functional OGG1 in Ogg1-/- mice led to an altered expression of genes including those responsible for the aberrant innate and adaptive immune responses and susceptibility to metabolic disorders. Therefore, the present study examined stimulus-driven OGG1-DNA interactions at whole genome level using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-coupled sequencing, and the roles of OGG1 enriched on the genome were validated by molecular and system-level approaches. Results showed that signaling levels of cellular ROS generated by TNF\u03b1, induced enrichment of OGG1 at specific sites of chromatinized DNA, primarily in the regulatory regions of genes. OGG1-ChIP-ed genes are associated with important cellular and biological processes and OGG1 enrichment was limited to a time scale required for immediate cellular responses. Prevention of OGG1-DNA interactions by siRNA depletion led to modulation of NF-\u03baB's DNA occupancy and differential expression of genes. Taken together these data show TNF\u03b1-ROS-driven enrichment of OGG1 at gene regulatory regions in the chromatinized DNA, which is a prerequisite to modulation of gene expression for prompt cellular responses to oxidant stress.",

Intercellular communication is essential for driving and resolving inflammatory responses in asthma. Emerging studies suggest that extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes facilitate this process. In this report, we have used a range of approaches to show that EVs contain markers of mitochondria derived from donor cells which are capable of sustaining a membrane potential. Further, we propose that these participate in intercellular communication within the airways of human subjects with asthma. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of both healthy volunteers and asthmatics contain EVs with encapsulated mitochondria; however, the % HLA-DR+ EVs containing mitochondria and the levels of mitochondrial DNA within EVs were significantly higher in asthmatics. Furthermore, mitochondria are present in exosomes derived from the pro-inflammatory HLA-DR+ subsets of airway myeloid-derived regulatory cells (MDRCs), which are known regulators of T cell responses in asthma. Exosomes tagged with MitoTracker Green, or derived from MDRCs transduced with CellLight Mitochondrial GFP were found in recipient peripheral T cells using a co-culture system, supporting direct exosome-mediated cell-cell transfer. Importantly, exosomally transferred mitochondria co-localize with the mitochondrial network and generate reactive oxygen species within recipient T cells. These findings support a potential novel mechanism of cell-cell communication involving exosomal transfer of mitochondria and the bioenergetic and/or redox regulation of target cells.",

However, the potential cytotoxic effects of bupivacaine on intervertebral disc (IVD) cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully established. Here, we showed that bupivacaine decreased the viability of rabbit IVD cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, the short-term cytotoxicity of bupivacaine in IVD cells was primarily due to cell necrosis, as assessed by Annexin V-propidium iodide staining and live/dead cell staining. Necrosis was verified by observations of swollen organelles, plasma membrane rupture, and cellular lysis under transmission electronic microscopy. Interestingly, our data indicated that bupivacaine-induced primary necrosis might involve the necroptosis pathway. The key finding of this study was that bupivacaine was able to induce lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) with the release of cathepsins into the cytosol, as evidenced by LysoTracker Red staining, acridine orange staining, and cathepsin D immunofluorescence staining. Consistently, inhibitors of lysosomal cathepsins, CA074-Me and pepstatin A, significantly reduced bupivacaine-induced cell death. Finally, we found that bupivacaine resulted in an increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that inhibition of ROS by N-acetyl-L-cysteine effectively blocked bupivacaine-induced LMP and cell death. In summary, the results of this in vitro study reveal a novel mechanism underlying bupivacaine-induced cell death involving ROS-mediated LMP. Our findings establish a basis for the further investigation of bupivacaine cytotoxicity in an in vivo system.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress predisposes to several aging-associated diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In aging, increase in the production of reactive oxygen species is typically accompanied with a decline in adaptive stress responses to oxidative stress. The decline is primarily due to a decrease in antioxidant production. Nuclear factor E2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2) is a key transcription factor regulating oxidative and electrophilic stress responses, but it has also been shown to play a role in the regulation of cell metabolism. NRF2 expression declines in aging, but the mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we show that microRNAs (miRNAs) that are abundant in old endothelial cells decrease NRF2 expression by direct targeting of NRF2 mRNA. The effect is reversed by miRNA inhibition. The senescence-associated downregulation of NRF2 decreases endothelial glycolytic activity and stress tolerance both of which are restored after reinstating NRF2. Manipulation of the senescence-associated miRNA levels affects the glycolytic activity and stress tolerance consistently with the NRF2 results. We conclude that senescence-associated miRNAs are involved in the decline of NRF2 expression, thus contributing to the repression of adaptive responses during cell senescence.",

Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) is known to play a key role in lung inflammation. Acute inflammation and its timely resolution are important to ensure bacterial clearance and limit tissue damage. Carbon monoxide (CO) has been shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects in various tissues and organ systems. Here, we explored the protective effects and mechanisms of carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) on P. aeruginosa-induced inflammatory responses in human pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells (HPAEpiCs). We showed that P. aeruginosa induced prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)/interleukin-6 (IL-6)/ICAM-1 expression and monocyte adherence to HPAEpiCs. Moreover, P. aeruginosa-induced inflammatory responses were inhibited by transfection with siRNA of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), PKC\u03b1, p47phox, JNK2, p42, p50, or p65. P. aeruginosa also induced PKC\u03b1, JNK, ERK1/2, and NF-\u03baB activation. We further demonstrated that P. aeruginosa increased intracellular ROS generation via NADPH oxidase activation. On the other hand, P. aeruginosa-induced inflammation was inhibited by pretreatment with CORM-2. Preincubation with CORM-2 had no effects on TLR4 mRNA levels in response to P. aeruginosa. However, CORM-2 inhibits P. aeruginosa-induced inflammation by decreasing intracellular ROS generation. P. aeruginosa-induced PKC\u03b1, JNK, ERK1/2, and NF-\u03baB activation was inhibited by CORM-2. Finally, we showed that P. aeruginosa induced levels of the biomarkers of inflammation in respiratory diseases, which were inhibited by pretreatment with CORM-2.

In this study, we investigated the role of Aspergillus proteases\u2014which contribute to the pathogenesis of Aspergillus-induced diseases such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and atopic asthma\u2014and their mechanisms of action in airway inflammation using primary human bronchial epithelial cells, and evaluated the inflammatory responses mediated by mitochondrial ROS. We found that Aspergillus proteases regulated the expression of multifunctional inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)\u2212\u202f1\u03b2, \u2212\u202f6, and \u2212\u202f8, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, which stimulated cytokine production and chemokines involved in leukocyte migration and activated an inflammatory cascade. Expression of these factors and activator protein (AP)\u2212\u202f1 were decreased by treatment with the mitochondrial ROS scavenger Mito-TEMPO, suggesting that mitochondria are important sources of ROS in the context of inflammatory response by Aspergillus protease. The regulation of mitochondrial ROS influenced the production of proinflammatory mediators by preventing mitochondrial ROS-induced AP-1 activation in airway epithelial cells. In addition, Aspergillus protease-mediated mitochondrial ROS production was associated with downregulation of uncoupling protein (UCP)\u2212\u202f2 expression by TGF-\u03b2-SMAD4 signaling, which may play a regulatory role in mitochondrial ROS formation during fungal protease-mediated epithelial inflammation.

CORMs are also explored as potential novel antimicrobial drugs, effectively and rapidly killing bacteria in vitro and in animal models, but are reportedly benign towards mammalian cells. Ru-carbonyl CORMs, exemplified by CORM-3 (Ru(CO)3Cl(glycinate)), exhibit the most potent antimicrobial effects against Escherichia coli. We demonstrate that CORM-3 releases little CO in buffers and cell culture media and that the active antimicrobial agent is Ru(II), which binds tightly to thiols. Thus, thiols and amino acids in complex growth media \u2013 such as histidine, methionine and oxidised glutathione, but most pertinently cysteine and reduced glutathione (GSH) \u2013 protect both bacterial and mammalian cells against CORM-3 by binding and sequestering Ru(II). No other amino acids exert significant protective effects. NMR reveals that CORM-3 binds cysteine and GSH in a 1:1 stoichiometry with dissociation constants, Kd, of about 5\u202f\u03bcM, while histidine, GSSG and methionine are bound less tightly, with Kd values ranging between 800 and 9000\u202f\u03bcM. There is a direct positive correlation between protection and amino acid affinity for CORM-3. Intracellular targets of CORM-3 in both bacterial and mammalian cells are therefore expected to include GSH, free Cys, His and Met residues and any molecules that contain these surface-exposed amino acids.

MicroRNA-200a (miR-200a) is reported to target Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which regulates nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) anti-oxidant pathway. Polydatin (3,4\u2032,5-trihydroxy-stilbene-3-\u03b2-D-glucoside), a polyphenol found in the rhizome of Polygonum cuspidatum, have anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperlipidemic effects. However, whether miR-200a controls Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in fructose-induced liver inflammation and lipid deposition and the blockade of polydatin are still not clear. Here, we detected miR-200a down-regulation, Keap1 up-regulation, Nrf2 antioxidant pathway inactivation, ROS-driven thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) over-expression, NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation and dysregulation of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR-\u03b1), carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), sterol regulatory element binging protein 1 (SREBP-1) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) in rat livers, BRL-3A and HepG2 cells under high fructose induction. Furthermore, the data from the treatment or transfection of miR-200a minic, Keap1 and TXNIP siRNA, Nrf2 activator and ROS inhibitor demonstrated that fructose-induced miR-200a low-expression increased Keap1 to block Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, and then enhanced ROS-driven TXNIP to activate NLRP3 inflammasome and disturb lipid metabolism-related proteins, causing inflammation and lipid deposition in BRL-3A cells. We also found that polydatin up-regulated miR-200a to inhibit Keap1 and activate Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, resulting in attenuation of these disturbances in these animal and cell models.

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress has been described as a prime driver of granulosa cell (GCs) death during follicular atresia. Increasing evidence suggests potential roles of melatonin in protecting GCs from oxidative injury, though the underlying mechanisms remain largely undetermined. Here we first proposed that the inhibition of autophagy through some novel regulators contributes to melatonin-mediated GCs survival under conditions of oxidative stress. Oxidant-induced loss of GCs viability was significantly reduced after melatonin administration, which was correlated with attenuated autophagic signals upon oxidative stimulation both in vivo and in vitro. Compared with melatonin treatment, suppression of autophagy displayed similar preventive effect on GCs death during oxidative stress, but melatonin provided no additional protection in GCs pretreated with autophagy inhibitors. Notably, we found that melatonin-directed regulation of autophagic death was independent of its antioxidation/radical scavenging ability. Further investigations identified FOXO1 as a critical downstream effector of melatonin in promoting GCs survival from oxidative stress-induced autophagy. Specifically, suppression of FOXO1 via the melatonin-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT axis not only improved GCs resistance to oxidative stress, but also abolished the autophagic response, from genes expression to the formation of autophagic vacuoles. Moreover, the activation of SIRT1 signaling was required for melatonin-mediated deacetylation of FOXO1 and its interaction with ATG proteins, as well as the inhibition of autophagic death in GCs suffering oxidative stress. These findings reveal a brand new mechanism of melatonin in defense against oxidative damage to GCs by repressing FOXO1, which may be a potential therapeutic target for anovulatory disorders.",

     "abstract": "Cellular oxidative stress plays a vital role in the pathological process of neural damage in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). The breast cancer susceptibility protein 1 (BRCA1), a tumor suppressor, can modulate cellular antioxidant response and DNA repair. Yet the role of BRCA1 in cerebral I/R injury has not been explored. In this study, we observed that BRCA1 was mainly expressed in neurons and was up-regulated in response to I/R insult. Overexpression of BRCA1 attenuated reactive oxygen species production and lipid peroxidation. Enhanced BRCA1 expression promoted DNA double strand break repair through non-homologous end joining pathway. These effects consequently led to neuronal cell survival and neurological recovery. Mechanically, BRCA1 can interact with the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2) through BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) domain. The cross-talk between BRCT and NRF2 activated the NRF2/Antioxidant Response Element signaling pathway and thus protected injured neurons during cerebral I/R.

     "abstract": "Chronic neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the onset and progression of brain proteinopathies such as Alzheimer disease (AD) and it is suspected to participate in the neurodegenerative process. Transcription factor NRF2, a master regulator of redox homeostasis, controls acute inflammation but its relevance in low-grade chronic inflammation of AD is inconclusive due to lack of good mouse models. We have addressed this question in a transgenic mouse that combines amyloidopathy and tauopathy with either wild type (AT-NRF2-WT) or NRF2-deficiency (AT-NRF2-KO). AT-NRF2-WT mice died prematurely, at around 14 months of age, due to motor deficits and a terminal spinal deformity but AT-NRF2-KO mice died roughly 2 months earlier. NRF2-deficiency correlated with exacerbated astrogliosis and microgliosis, as determined by an increase in GFAP, IBA1 and CD11b levels. The immunomodulatory molecule dimethyl fumarate (DMF), a drug already used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis whose main target is accepted to be NRF2, was tested in this preclinical model. Daily oral gavage of DMF during six weeks reduced glial and inflammatory markers and improved cognition and motor complications in the AT-NRF2-WT mice compared with the vehicle-treated animals. This study demonstrates the relevance of the inflammatory response in experimental AD, tightly regulated by NRF2 activity, and provides a new strategy to fight AD.",

We show for the first time that MMP-2 is upstream of increased ROS formation and activates signaling mechanisms impairing redox balance. Incubation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) with recombinant MMP-2 increased ROS formation assessed with dihydroethidium (DHE) by flow cytometry. This effect was blocked by the antioxidant apocynin or by polyethylene glycol-catalase (PEG-catalase), and by MMP inhibitors (doxycycline or GM6001). Next, we showed in HEK293 cells that MMP-2 transactivates heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) leading to EGF receptor (EGFR) activation and increased ROS concentrations. This effect was prevented by the EGFR kinase inhibitor Ag1478, and by phospholipase C (PLC) or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors (A778 or chelerythrine, respectively), confirming the involvement of EGFR pathway in MMP-2-induce responses. Next, we showed that intraluminal exposure of aortas to MMP-2 increased vascular MMP-2 levels detected by immunofluorescence and gelatinolytic activity (by in situ zimography) in association with increased ROS formation. This effect was inhibited by MMP inhibitors (phenanthroline or doxycycline) and by apocynin or PEG-catalase. MMP-2 also increased aortic contractility to phenylephrine and this effect was prevented by MMP inhibitor GM6001 and by apocynin or PEG-catalase, showing again that increased ROS formation mediates functional effects of MMP-2. These results show that MMP-2 activates the EGFR and triggers downstream signaling pathways increasing ROS formation and promoting vasoconstriction. These findings may have various implications for cardiovascular diseases.",

     "abstract": "DNA damage is presumed to be one type of stochastic macromolecular damage that contributes to aging, yet little is known about the precise mechanism by which DNA damage drives aging. Here, we attempt to address this gap in knowledge using DNA repair-deficient C. elegans and mice. ERCC1-XPF is a nuclear endonuclease required for genomic stability and loss of ERCC1 in humans and mice accelerates the incidence of age-related pathologies. Like mice, ercc-1 worms are UV sensitive, shorter lived, display premature functional decline and they accumulate spontaneous oxidative DNA lesions (cyclopurines) more rapidly than wild-type worms. We found that ercc-1 worms displayed early activation of DAF-16 relative to wild-type worms, which conferred resistance to multiple stressors and was important for maximal longevity of the mutant worms. However, DAF-16 activity was not maintained over the lifespan of ercc-1 animals and this decline in DAF-16 activation corresponded with a loss of stress resistance, a rise in oxidant levels and increased morbidity, all of which were cep-1/ p53 dependent. A similar early activation of FOXO3A (the mammalian homolog of DAF-16), with increased resistance to oxidative stress, followed by a decline in FOXO3A activity and an increase in oxidant abundance was observed in Ercc1-/- primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Likewise, in vivo, ERCC1-deficient mice had transient activation of FOXO3A in early adulthood as did middle-aged wild-type mice, followed by a late life decline. The healthspan and mean lifespan of ERCC1 deficient mice was rescued by inactivation of p53. These data indicate that activation of DAF-16/FOXO3A is a highly conserved response to genotoxic stress that is important for suppressing consequent oxidative stress. Correspondingly, dysregulation of DAF-16/FOXO3A appears to underpin shortened healthspan and lifespan, rather than the increased DNA damage burden itself.",

Although tremendous knowledge on auxin perception and signaling has been gained in the last years, SCFTIR1/AFBs complex assembly and stabilization are emerging as new layers of regulation. Here, we investigated how nitric oxide (NO), through S-nitrosylation of ASK1 is involved in SCFTIR1/AFBs assembly. We demonstrate that ASK1\u00a0is S-nitrosylated and S-glutathionylated in cysteine (Cys) 37 and Cys118 residues in vitro. Both, in vitro and in vivo protein-protein interaction assays show that NO enhances ASK1 binding to CUL1 and TIR1/AFB2, required for SCFTIR1/AFB2 assembly. In addition, we demonstrate that Cys37 and Cys118 are essential residues for proper activation of auxin signaling pathway in planta. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Cys37 residue is only conserved in SKP proteins in Angiosperms, suggesting that S-nitrosylation on Cys37 could represent an evolutionary adaption for SKP1 function in flowering plants. Collectively, these findings indicate that multiple events of redox modifications might be part of a fine-tuning regulation of SCFTIR1/AFBs for proper auxin signal transduction.",

The mice were orally administered melatonin (50\u202fmg/kg) by 3 weeks. Diastolic function was significantly improved by melatonin supplementation in mice fed an HFD. Melatonin attenuated obesity-induced myocardial oxidative stress and apoptosis and promoted the secretion of C1q/tumour necrosis factor-related protein 3 (CTRP3) by adipose tissue. And depletion of circulating CTRP3 largely abolished melatonin-mediated cardio-protection. Melatonin-mediated secretion of adipocyte-derived CTRP3 activated NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which were largely abrogated by knocking down CTRP3 in adipocytes or Nrf2 in cardiomyocytes. Nrf2 activation was mediated by miR-200a, and a miR-200a antagomir offset the effects of melatonin-conditioned medium on Nrf2 expression.

The aim of our study is to investigate the role of Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3) in treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with a focus on mitophagy and the ERK-CREB pathway. Our data indicated that Sirt3 was downregulated in liver tissue in response to chronic HFD treatment. Interestingly, re-introduction of Sirt3 protected hepatic function, attenuated liver fibrosis, alleviated the inflammatory response, and prevented hepatocyte apoptosis. Molecular investigations demonstrated that lipotoxicity was associated with an increase in mitochondrial apoptosis as evidenced by reduced mitochondrial potential, augmented ROS production, increased cyt-c leakage into the nucleus, and activated caspase-9 apoptotic signalling. Additionally, Sirt3 overexpression protected hepatocytes against mitochondrial apoptosis via promoting Bnip3-required mitophagy. Functional studies showed that Sirt3 reversed Bnip3 expression and mitophagy activity via the ERK-CREB signalling pathway. Blockade of the ERK-CREB axis repressed the promotive effects of Sirt3 on Bnip3 activation and mitophagy augmentation, finally negating the anti-apoptotic influences of Sirt3 on hepatocytes in the setting of high-fat-stress. Collectively, our data show that high-fat-mediated liver damage is associated with Sirt3 downregulation, which is followed by ERK-CREB pathway inactivation and Bnip3-mediated inhibition of mitophagy, causing hepatocytes to undergo mitochondria-dependent cell death. Based on this, strategies for enhancing Sirt3 activity and activating the ERK-CREB-Bnip3-mitophagy pathways could be used to treat nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",

In this study, we found that overexpression of nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase (NNT) was associated with shorter overall and disease free survival in gastric cancer. The NNT is considered a key antioxidative enzyme based on its ability to regenerate NADPH from NADH. Knockdown of NNT caused significantly NADPH reduction, induced high levels of ROS and significant cell apoptosis under oxidative stress conditions such as glucose deprival and anoikis. In vivo experiments showed that NNT promoted tumor growth, lung metastasis and peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer. Moreover, intratumoral injection of NNT siRNA significantly suppressed gastric tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Overall, our study highlights the crucial functional roles of NNT in redox regulation and tumor progression and thus raises an important therapeutic hypothesis in gastric cancer.",

     "abstract": "Our aim was to elucidate the relationship between the rate of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) formation and the reduction level of the mitochondrial coenzyme Q (mQ) pool under various levels of engagement of the mQ-reducing pathway (succinate dehydrogenase, complex II) and mQH2-oxidizing pathways (the cytochrome pathway and alternative oxidase pathway, (AOX)) in mitochondria isolated from the amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii. The mQ pool was shifted to a more reduced state by inhibition of mQH2-oxidizing pathways (complex III and complex IV of the cytochrome pathway, and AOX) and the oxidative phosphorylation system. The mQ reduction level was lowered by decreasing the electron supply from succinate dehydrogenase and by stimulating the activity of the cytochrome or AOX pathways. The results indicate a direct dependence of mROS formation on the reduction level of the mQ pool for both mQH2-oxidizing pathways. A higher mQ reduction level leads to a higher mROS formation. For the cytochrome pathway, mROS generation depends nonlinearly upon the mQ reduction level, with a stronger dependency observed at values higher than the mQ reduction level of the phosphorylating state (~\u202f35%). AOX becomes more engaged at higher mQ pool reduction levels (above 40%), when mROS production via the cytochrome pathway increases. We propose that the mQ pool reduction level (endogenous mQ redox state) could be a useful endogenous reporter that allows indirect assessment of overall mROS production in mitochondria.",

We investigated whether pomegranate (POM) protects against binge alcohol-induced gut leakiness, endotoxemia, and inflammatory liver damage. After POM pretreatment for 10 days, rats were exposed to 3 oral doses of binge alcohol (5\u202fg/kg/dose) or dextrose (as control) at 12-h intervals. Binge alcohol exposure induced leaky gut with significantly elevated plasma endotoxin and inflammatory fatty liver by increasing the levels of oxidative and nitrative stress marker proteins such as ethanol-inducible CYP2E1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nitrated proteins in the small intestine and liver. POM pretreatment significantly reduced the alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction, plasma endotoxin and inflammatory liver disease by inhibiting the elevated oxidative and nitrative stress marker proteins. POM pretreatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claundin-3 markedly diminished after alcohol-exposure. In addition, the levels of gut adherent junction (AJ) proteins (e.g., \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin) and desmosome plakoglobin along with associated protein \u03b1-tubulin were clearly decreased in binge alcohol-exposed rats but restored to basal levels in POM-pretreated rats. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analyses revealed that intestinal claudin-1 protein was nitrated and ubiquitinated in alcohol-exposed rats, whereas these modifications were significantly blocked by POM pretreatment. These results showed for the first time that POM can prevent alcohol-induced gut leakiness and inflammatory liver injury by suppressing oxidative and nitrative stress.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the implications of tau ablation on the mitochondrial function and cognitive abilities of a litter of young mice (3 months old). Our results showed that tau deletion had positive effects on hippocampal cells by decreasing oxidative damage, favoring a mitochondrial pro-fusion state, and inhibiting mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) formation by reducing cyclophilin D (Cyp-D) protein. More importantly, tau deletion increased ATP production and improved the recognition memory and attentive capacity of juvenile mice.

Here we used the small molecule enoxacin to pharmacologically interfere with miRNA biogenesis and study how it affects aging in C. elegans. Enoxacin extended worm lifespan and promoted survival under normal and oxidative stress conditions. Enoxacin-induced longevity required the transcription factor SKN-1/Nrf2 and was blunted by the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine, suggesting a prooxidant-mediated mitohormetic response. The longevity effects of enoxacin were also dependent on the miRNA pathway, consistent with changes in miRNA expression elicited by the drug. Among these differentially expressed miRNAs, the widely conserved miR-34-5p was found to play an important role in enoxacin-mediated longevity. Enoxacin treatment down-regulated miR-34-5p and did not further extend lifespan of long-lived mir-34 mutants. Moreover, N-acetyl-cysteine abrogated mir-34(gk437)-induced longevity. Evidence also points to double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminases (ADARs) as new targets of enoxacin since ADAR loss-of-function abrogates enoxacin-induced lifespan extension. Thus, enoxacin increases lifespan by reducing miR-34-5p levels, interfering with the redox balance and promoting healthspan.",

The goal of the present study was to monitor the formation of carnosine-aldehyde adducts, following high-intensity intermittent exercise, before and after \u03b2-alanine supplementation. Vastus lateralis biopsy samples were taken from 14 cyclists, before and after a 28\u202fday \u03b2-alanine supplementation, following 4 bouts of a 30\u202fs all-out cycling test, and carnosine and CAR-aldehyde adducts [carnosine-acrolein, CAR-ACR (m/z 303), carnosine-4-hydroxy-2-hexenal, CAR-HHE (m/z 341) and carnosine-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, CAR-HNE (m/z 383)] were quantified by HPLC-MS/MS. \u03b2-alanine supplementation increased muscle carnosine content by ~50% (p\u202f=\u202f0.0001 vs. Pre-Supplementation). Interestingly, there was a significant increase in post-exercise CAR-ACR content following \u03b2-alanine supplementation (p\u202f<\u202f0.001 vs. post-exercise before supplementation), whereas neither exercise alone nor supplementation alone increased CAR-ACR formation. These results suggest that carnosine functions as an acrolein-scavenger in skeletal muscle. Such a role would be relevant to the detoxification of this aldehyde formed during exercise, and appears to be enhanced by \u03b2-alanine supplementation.

     "abstract": "Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure in many developed countries. Mitochondrial oxidative stress is considered to be the predominant cellular event in APAP-induced liver injury. Accordingly, N-acetyl cysteine, a known scavenger of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is recommended as an effective clinical antidote against APAP-induced acute liver injury (AILI) when it is given at an early phase; however, the narrow therapeutic window limits its use. Hence, the development of novel therapeutic approaches that can offer broadly protective effects against AILI is clearly needed. To this end, it is necessary to better understand the mechanisms of APAP hepatotoxicity. Up to now, in addition to mitochondrial oxidative stress, many other cellular processes, including phase I/phase II metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, sterile inflammation, microcirculatory dysfunction, and liver regeneration, have been identified to be involved in the pathogenesis of AILI, providing new targets for developing more effective therapeutic interventions against APAP-induced liver injury. In this review, we summarize intracellular and extracellular events involved in APAP hepatotoxicity, along with emphatic discussions on the possible therapeutic approaches targeting these different cellular events.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to antioxidants and xenobiotics triggers the expression of a myriad of genes encoding antioxidant proteins, detoxifying enzymes, and xenobiotic transporters to offer protection against oxidative stress. This articulated universal mechanism is regulated through the cis-acting elements in an array of Nrf2 target genes called antioxidant response elements (AREs), which play a critical role in redox homeostasis. Though the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE system involves many players, AREs hold the key in transcriptional regulation of cytoprotective genes. ARE-mediated reporter constructs have been widely used, including xenobiotics profiling and Nrf2 activator screening. The complexity of AREs is brought by the presence of other regulatory elements within the AREs. The diversity in the ARE sequences not only bring regulatory selectivity of diverse transcription factors, but also confer functional complexity in the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway. The different transcription factors either homodimerize or heterodimerize to bind the AREs. Depending on the nature of partners, they may activate or suppress the transcription. Attention is required for deeper mechanistic understanding of ARE-mediated gene regulation. The computational methods of identification and analysis of AREs are still in their infancy. Investigations are required to know whether epigenetics mechanism plays a role in the regulation of genes mediated through AREs. The polymorphisms in the AREs leading to oxidative stress related diseases are warranted. A thorough understanding of AREs will pave the way for the development of therapeutic agents against cancer, neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, metabolic and other diseases with oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "High circulatory insulin and leptin followed by underlying inflammation are often ascribed to the ectopic manifestations in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) but the exact molecular pathways remain unclear. We have shown previously that CYP2E1-mediated oxidative stress and circulating leptin in NAFLD is associated with renal disease severity. Extending the studies, we hypothesized that high circulatory leptin in NAFLD causes renal mesangial cell activation and tubular inflammation via a NOX2 dependent pathway that upregulates proinflammatory miR21. High-fat diet (60%\u202fkcal) was used to induce fatty liver phenotype with parallel insulin and leptin resistance. The kidneys were probed for mesangial cell activation and tubular inflammation that showed accelerated NASH phenotype and oxidative stress in the liver. Results showed that NAFLD kidneys had significant increases in \u03b1-SMA, a marker of mesangial cell activation, miR21 levels, tyrosine nitration and renal inflammation while they were significantly decreased in leptin and p47 phox knockout mice. Micro RNA21 knockout mice showed decreased tubular immunotoxicity and proinflammatory mediator release. Mechanistically, use of NOX2 siRNA or apocynin,phenyl boronic acid (FBA), DMPO or miR21 antagomir inhibited leptin primed-miR21-mediated mesangial cell activation in vitro suggesting a direct role of leptin-mediated NOX-2 in miR21-mediated mesangial cell activation. Finally, JAK-STAT inhibitor completely abrogated the mesangial cell activation in leptin-primed cells suggesting that leptin signaling in the mesangial cells depended on the JAK-STAT pathway. Taken together the study reports a novel mechanistic pathway of leptin-mediated renal inflammation that is dependent on NOX-2-miR21 axis in ectopic manifestations underlying NAFLD-induced co-morbidities.",

     "abstract": "Melanogenesis is a complex biosynthetic pathway regulated by multiple agents, which are involved in the production, transport, and release of melanin. Melanin has diverse roles, including determination of visible skin color and photoprotection. Studies indicate that melanin synthesis is tightly linked to the interaction between melanocytes and keratinocytes. \u03b1-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) is known as a trigger that enhances melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes through paracrine effects. Accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) in skin affects both keratinocytes and melanocytes by causing DNA damage, which eventually leads to the stimulation of \u03b1-MSH production. Mitochondria are one of the main sources of ROS in the skin and play a central role in modulating redox-dependent cellular processes such as metabolism and apoptosis. Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction may serve as a key for the pathogenesis of skin melanogenesis. Mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) is a key enzyme that regulates mitochondrial redox balance and reduces oxidative stress-induced cell injury through the generation of NADPH. Downregulation of IDH2 expression resulted in an increase in oxidative DNA damage in mice skin through ROS-dependent ATM-mediated p53 signaling. IDH2 deficiency also promoted pigmentation on the dorsal skin of mice, as evident from the elevated levels of melanin synthesis markers. Furthermore, pretreatment with mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mito-TEMPO alleviated oxidative DNA damage and melanogenesis induced by IDH2 deficiency both in vitro and in vivo. Together, our findings highlight the role of IDH2 in skin melanogenesis in association with mitochondrial ROS and suggest unique therapeutic strategies for the prevention of skin pigmentation.",

Previously, we showed that general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), an eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1) kinase, impairs the ventricular adaptation to chronic pressure overload by affecting cardiomyocyte apoptosis. However, the impact of GCN2 on Dox-induced cardiotoxicity has not been investigated. In the present study, we treated wild type (WT) and Gcn2\u2212/\u2212 mice with four intraperitoneal injections (5\u202fmg/kg/week) to induce cardiomyopathy. After Dox treatment, Gcn2\u2212/\u2212 mice developed less contractile dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress compared with WT mice. In the hearts of the Dox-treated mice, GCN2 deficiency attenuated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation and induction of its downstream targets, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and preserved the expression of anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-2 and mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2(UCP2). Furthermore, we found that GCN2 knockdown attenuated, whereas GCN2 overexpression exacerbated, Dox-induced cell death, oxidative stress and reduction of Bcl-2 and UCP2 expression through the eIF2\u03b1-CHOP-dependent pathway in H9C2 cells. Collectively, our data provide solid evidence that GCN2 has a marked effect on Dox induced myocardial apoptosis and oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that strategies to inhibit GCN2 activity in cardiomyocyte may provide a novel approach to attenuate Dox-related cardiotoxicity.",

While PTMs have been largely investigated independently, examination into how different modification interact, or crosstalk, will reveal a more complete understanding of the reciprocity of signaling cascades across numerous pathways. Combinatorial reversible thiol oxidation and phosphorylation in eukaryotes is largely recognized, but rigorous approaches for experimental discovery are underdeveloped. To begin meaningful interrogation of PTM crosstalk in systems biology research, knowledge of targeted proteins must be advanced. Herein, we demonstrate protein-level enrichment of reversibly oxidized proteoforms in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with subsequent phosphopeptide analysis to determine the extent of phosphorylation in the redox thiol proteome. Label-free quantification was used to quantify 3353 oxidized Cys-sites on 1457 enriched proteins, where sequential phosphopeptide enrichment measured 1094 sites of phosphorylation on 720 proteins with 23% (172 proteins) also identified as reversibly oxidized. Proteins identified with both reversible oxidation and phosphorylation were involved in signaling transduction, ribosome and translation-related machinery, and metabolic pathways. Several redox-modified Calvin-Benson cycle proteins were found phosphorylated and many kinases/phosphatases involved in phosphorylation-dependent photosynthetic state transition and stress-response pathways had sites of reversible oxidation. Identification of redox proteins serves as a crucial element in understanding stress response in photosynthetic organisms and beyond, whereby knowing the ensemble of modifications co-occurring with oxidation highlights novel mechanisms for cellular control.",

In this study, we characterized Hcy metabolism in mouse tissues by using LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis, established tissue expression profiles for 84 nuclear-encoded Mt electron transport chain complex (nMt-ETC-Com) genes in 20 human and 19 mouse tissues by database mining, and modeled the effect of HHcy on Mt-ETC function. Hcy levels were high in mouse kidney/lung/spleen/liver (24\u201314 nmol/g tissue) but low in brain/heart (~5 nmol/g). S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels were high in the liver/kidney (59\u201333 nmol/g), moderate in lung/heart/brain (7\u20134 nmol/g) and low in spleen (1 nmol/g). S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was comparable in all tissues (42\u201318 nmol/g). SAM/SAH ratio was as high as 25.6 in the spleen but much lower in the heart/lung/brain/kidney/liver (7\u20130.6). The nMt-ETC-Com genes were highly expressed in muscle/pituitary gland/heart/BM in humans and in lymph node/heart/pancreas/brain in mice. We identified 15 Hcy-suppressive nMt-ETC-Com genes whose mRNA levels were negatively correlated with tissue Hcy levels, including 11 complex-I, one complex-IV and two complex-V genes. Among the 11 Hcy-suppressive complex-I genes, 4 are complex-I core subunits. Based on the pattern of tissue expression of these genes, we classified tissues into three tiers (high/mid/low-Hcy responsive), and defined heart/eye/pancreas/brain/kidney/liver/testis/embryonic tissues as tier 1 (high-Hcy responsive) tissues in both human and mice. Furthermore, through extensive literature mining, we found that most of the Hcy-suppressive nMt-ETC-Com genes were suppressed in HHcy conditions and related with Mt complex assembly/activity impairment in human disease and experimental models.

SirT1 knockdown in HepG2 cells were further applied to confirm the role of SirT1 in the protection of NR on lipid accumulation.We found that ethanol significantly decreased the expression and activity of hepatic SirT1 and induced abnormal expression of enzymes of lipid metabolism in mice. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments showed that NR activated SirT1 through increasing NAD+ levels, decreased oxidative stress, increased deacetylation of PGC-1\u03b1 and mitochondrial function. In SirT1 knockdown HepG2 cells, NR lost its ability in enhancing mitochondrial function, and its protection against lipid accumulation induced by ethanol.NR can protect against ethanol induced liver injuries via replenishing NAD+, reducing oxidative stress, and activating SirT1-PGC-1\u03b1-mitochondrial biosynthesis.

     "abstract": "PARP inhibitors have been widely tested in clinical trials, especially for the treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer, and were shown to be highly successful. Because PARP primarily functions in sensing and repairing DNA strand breaks, the therapeutic effect of PARP inhibition is generally believed to be attributed to impaired DNA repair. We here report that oxidative stress is also increased by PARP inhibition and mediates the antitumor effect. We showed that PARP1 is highly expressed in specimens of high grade serous ovarian carcinoma and its activity is required for unperturbed proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. Inhibition or depletion of PARP leads to not only an increase in DNA damage, but also an elevation in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Importantly, antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated the induction of DNA damage and the perturbation of proliferation by PARP inhibition or depletion. We further showed that NADPH oxidases 1 and 4 were significantly upregulated by PARP inhibition and were partially responsible for the induction of oxidative stress. Depletion of NOX1 and NOX4 partially rescued the growth inhibition of PARP1-deficient tumor xenografts. Our findings suggest that in addition to compromising the repair of DNA damage, PARP inhibition or depletion may exert extra antitumor effect by elevating oxidative stress in ovarian cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "Glucose, chief metabolic support for cancer cell survival and growth, is mainly imported into cells by facilitated glucose transporters (GLUTs). The increase in glucose uptake along with tumor progression is due to an increment of facilitative glucose transporters as GLUT1. GLUT1 prevents cell death of cancer cells caused by growth factors deprivation, but there is scarce information about its role on the damage caused by glucose deprivation, which usually occurs within the core of a growing tumor. In prostate cancer (PCa), GLUT1 is found in the most aggressive tumors, and it is regulated by androgens. To study the response of androgen-sensitive and insensitive PCa cells to glucose deprivation and the role of GLUT1 on survival mechanisms, androgen-sensitive LNCaP and castration-resistant LNCaP-R cells were employed. Results demonstrated that glucose deprivation induced a necrotic type of cell death which is prevented by antioxidants. Androgen-sensitive cells show a higher resistance to cell death triggered by glucose deprivation than castration-resistant cells. Glucose removal causes an increment of H2O2, an activation of androgen receptor (AR) and a stimulation of AMP-activated protein kinase activity. In addition, glucose removal increases GLUT1 production in androgen sensitive PCa cells. GLUT1 ectopic overexpression makes PCa cells more resistant to glucose deprivation and oxidative stress-induced cell death. Under glucose deprivation, GLUT1 overexpressing PCa cells sustains mitochondrial SOD2 activity, compromised after glucose removal, and significantly increases reduced glutathione (GSH). In conclusion, androgen-sensitive PCa cells are more resistant to glucose deprivation-induced cell death by a GLUT1 upregulation through an enhancement of reduced glutathione levels.",

     "abstract": "A new 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH)-based photometric assay is developed for the quantification of carbonyls in protein samples from any biological source by protein carbonyl-DNPH hydrazone formation at acidic pH in the presence of denaturing urea, and subsequent hydrazone solubilization in the presence of SDS and stabilization from acid hydrolysis at pH 7.0. At this neutral (ntr) pH, interfering unreacted DNPH is uncharged and its thus increased hydrophobicity permits its 100% effective removal from the solubilizate with ethyl acetate/hexane wash. The ntrDNPH assay is more reliable and sensitive than the standard (std) DNPH photometric assay because it eliminates its main limitations: (i) interfering unreacted DNPH (pKa 1.55) that is nonspecifically bound to the TCA (pKa 0.7)-protein pellet is not effectively removed after wash with EtOH: ethyl acetate because it is positively charged, (ii) acid (TCA-induced) hydrolysis of the protein carbonyl-DNPH hydrazone, (iii) sample protein concentration re-determination, (iv) loss of sample acid (TCA)-soluble proteins, (v) DNA interference, and (vi) requires high protein quantity samples (\u2265\u202f1\u202fmg). Considering ntrDNPH assay\u2019s very low protein limit (1\u202f\u00b5g), its cumulative and functional sensitivities are 2600- and 2000-fold higher than those of the stdDNPH assay, respectively. The present study elucidates the DNA interference mechanism on the stdDNPH assay, and also develops a standardized protocol for sample protein treatment and fractionation (into cytoplasmic/aqueous, membrane/lipid-bound, and histone/DNA-bound proteins; see Supplement section V) in order to ensure reproducible carbonyl determination on defined cell protein fractions, and to eliminate assay interference from protein samples containing (i) Cys sulfenic acid groups (via their neutralization with dithiothreitol), and (ii) DNA (via its removal by streptomycin sulfate precipitation). Lastly, the ntrDNPH assay determines carbonyl groups on cell wall polysaccharides, thus paving the way on studies to investigate cell walls acting as antioxidant defense in plants, fungi, bacteria and lichens.",

     "abstract": "Carbon ion therapy is a promising modality in radiotherapy to treat tumors, however, a potential risk of induction of late normal tissue damage should still be investigated and protected. The aim of the present study was to explore the long-term cognitive deficits provoked by a high-linear energy transfer (high-LET) carbon ions in mice by targeting to hippocampus which plays a crucial role in memory and learning. Our data showed that, one month after 4\u202fGy carbon ion exposure, carbon ion irradiation conspicuously resulted in the impaired cognitive performance, neurodegeneration and neuronal cell death, as well as the reduced mitochondrial integrity, the disrupted activities of tricarboxylic acid cycle flux and electron transport chain, and the depressed antioxidant defense system, consequently leading to a decline of ATP production and persistent oxidative damage in the hippocampus region. Mechanistically, we demonstrated the disruptions of mitochondrial homeostasis and redox balance typically characterized by the disordered mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy and glutathione redox couple, which is closely associated with the inhibitions of PINK1 and NRF2 signaling pathway as the key regulators of molecular responses in the context of neurotoxicity and neurodegenerative disorders. Most importantly, we found that administration with melatonin as a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant promoted the PINK1 accumulation on the mitochondrial membrane, and augmented the NRF2 accumulation and translocation. Moreover, melatonin pronouncedly enhanced the molecular interplay between NRF2 and PINK1. Furthermore, in the mouse hippocampal neuronal cells, overexpression of NRF2/PINK1 strikingly protected the hippocampal neurons from carbon ion-elicited toxic insults. Thus, these data suggest that alleviation of the sustained mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress through co-modulation of NRF2 and PINK1 may be in charge of restoration of the cognitive impairments in a mouse model of high-LET carbon ion irradiation.",

Importantly, repetitive exposure to Plasmodium results in asymptomatic infections, which is a condition defined as clinical tolerance. Integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data provides a powerful way to investigate complex disease processes involving oxidative stress, energy metabolism and immune cell activation. We used metabolomics and transcriptomics to investigate the different clinical outcomes in a P. vivax controlled human malaria infection trial. At baseline, the na\u00efve and semi-immune subjects differed in the expression of interferon related genes, neutrophil and B cell signatures that progressed with distinct kinetics after infection. Metabolomics data indicated differences in amino acid pathways and lipid metabolism between the two groups. Top pathways during the course of infection included methionine and cysteine metabolism, fatty acid metabolism and urea cycle. There is also evidence for the activation of lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase and non-specific lipid peroxidation products in the semi-immune group. The integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed concerted molecular events triggered by the infection, notably involving platelet activation, innate immunity and T cell signaling. Additional experiment confirmed that the metabolites associated with platelet activation genes were indeed enriched in the platelet metabolome.",

To elucidate why, we used zebrafish development as a model system and found that knockdown of MGST1 produced impaired hematopoiesis. We show that MGST1 is expressed early during zebrafish development and plays an important role in hematopoiesis. High expression of MGST1 was detected in regions of active hematopoiesis and co-expressed with markers for hematopoietic stem cells. Further, morpholino-mediated knock-down of MGST1 led to a significant reduction of differentiated hematopoietic cells both from the myeloid and the lymphoid lineages. In fact, hemoglobin was virtually absent in the knock-down fish as revealed by diaminofluorene staining. The impact of MGST1 on hematopoiesis was also shown in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) isolated from mice, where it was expressed at high levels. Upon promoting HSPC differentiation, lentiviral shRNA MGST1 knockdown significantly reduced differentiated, dedicated cells of the hematopoietic system. Further, MGST1 knockdown resulted in a significant lowering of mitochondrial metabolism and an induction of glycolytic enzymes, energetic states closely coupled to HSPC dynamics. Thus, the non-selenium, glutathione dependent redox regulatory enzyme MGST1 is crucial for embryonic development and for hematopoiesis in vertebrates.",

Anoikis resistance is a key process during tumor metastasis, which is usually accompanied with metabolism reprogram. In this study, we established an anchorage independent growth model for MDA-MB-231 cells and investigated the changes in metabolism and redox homeostasis. Results showed that during detached-growth, MDA-MB-231 cells tend to generate ATP through fatty acid oxidation (FAO), instead of glycolysis. Amount of glucose was used for pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to keep redox balance. Moreover, we discovered that a synthesized flavonoid derivative GL-V9, exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on the anchorage independent growth of TNBCs in vitro and anti-metastasis effect in vivo. In terms of the mechanism, GL-V9 could promote the expression and activity of AMPK, leading to the decrease of G6PD and the increase of p-ACC. Thus, the level of PPP was suppressed, whereas FAO was highly enhanced. The reprogram of glycolipid metabolism destroyed the redox balance ultimately and induced cell death. This paper indicated a novel regulating mechanism of redox homeostasis involving with glycolipid metabolism, and provided a potential candidate for the anti-metastatic therapy of TNBCs.",

     "abstract": "The initial rates of superoxide plus hydrogen peroxide (ROS) generation by intact or permeabilized rat heart mitochondria and coupled inside-out bovine heart submitochondrial particles (SMP) oxidizing NAD-dependent substrates, NADH, and succinate were measured by detecting resorufin formation in the Amplex Red assay at various oxygen concentrations. Linear dependences of the initial rates on oxygen concentration within the range of ~125\u2013750\u202f\u03bcM were found for all significant mitochondrial generators, i.e. the respiratory complexes and ammonium-stimulated dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. At lower oxygen concentrations upon its decrease from air saturation level to zero, the time-course of resorufin formation by SMP catalyzing coupled oxidation of succinate (the total ROS production by respiratory complexes II and III and by the reverse electron transfer (RET)-mediated by complex I) also corresponds to the linear dependence on oxygen with the same first-order rate constant determined in the initial rate studies. Prolonged incubation of SMP generating succinate-supported complex I-mediated ROS affected neither their NADH oxidase nor ROS generating activity. In contrast to SMP significant deviation from the first-order oxygen dependence in the time-course kinetics during coupled oxidation of succinate by intact mitochondria was evident. Complex I catalyzes the NADH:resorufin oxidoreductase reaction resulting in formation of colorless reduced resorufin. Hydrogen peroxide oxidizes reduced resorufin in the presence of peroxidase, thus showing its dihydroresorufin peroxidase activity. Combined NADH:resorufin reductase and dihydroresorufin peroxidase activities result in underestimation of the amount of hydrogen peroxide generated by mitochondria. We conclude that only initial rates of the mitochondrial ROS production, not the amount of resorufin accumulated, should be taken as the reliable measure of the mitochondrial ROS-generating activity, because of the cycling of the oxidized and reduced resorufin during Amplex Red assays fed by NADH and other possible reductant(s) present in mitochondria.",

Taking advantage of the use of mice deficient in PTP1B we have investigated the effect of \u03b3-radiation in these animals and found enhanced lethality and decreased respiratory exchange ratio vs. the corresponding wild type animals. Using bone-marrow derived macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from wild-type and PTP1B-deficient mice, we observed a differential response to various cell stressors. PTP1B-deficient macrophages exhibited an enhanced response to \u03b3-radiation, UV-light, LPS and S-nitroso-glutathione. Macrophages exposed to \u03b3-radiation show DNA damage and fragmentation, increased ROS production, a lack in GSH elevation and enhanced acidic \u03b2-galactosidase activity. Interestingly, these differences were not observed in MEFs. Differential gene expression analysis of WT and KO macrophages revealed that the main pathways affected after irradiation were an up-regulation of protein secretion, TGF-\u03b2 signaling and angiogenesis among other, and downregulation of Myc targets and Hedgehog signaling.

     "abstract": "The therapeutic benefits offered by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are limited because of the acquisition of drug resistance, the main cause of treatment failure and metastasis. The ability of the cancer cells to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes significantly to cancer metastatic potential and chemo-resistance. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of 5-FU-resistance have remained elusive. Here, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced by dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2), promote 5-FU-induced EMT. First, we showed that 5-FU\u2013resistant SNUC5 colon cancer cells (SNUC5/FUR cells) undergo EMT by analyzing the expression of EMT markers such as N-cadherin, vimentin and E-cadherin. In addition, we found that the resistant cells expressed higher levels of Snail, Slug, Twist and Zeb1, which are all critical EMT regulators and had enhanced migratory and invasive capabilities. Furthermore, SNUC5/FUR cells had increased level of DUOX2, resulting in increased ROS level. This effect was due to the enhanced binding of the ten eleven translocation 1 (TET1) demethylase to the DUOX2 promoter in the SNUC5/FUR cells. Importantly, silencing of TET1 reversed the effects of 5-FU on the cells. Finally, the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine attenuated the effects of 5-FU on EMT and metastasis. Our study demonstrates the existence of a TET1/DUOX2/ROS/EMT axis that could play a role in colon cancer chemo-resistance and the aggressiveness of this cancer.",

     "abstract": "Cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44) is the most common cancer stem cell (CSC) marker and high CD44 expression has been associated with anticancer drug resistance, tumor recurrence, and metastasis. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism by which CD44 and nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2; NRF2), a key regulator of antioxidant genes, are linked to CSC resistance using CD44high breast CSC-like cells. NRF2 expression was higher in CD44high cell populations isolated from doxorubicin-resistant MCF7 (ADR), as well as MCF7, MDA-MB231, and A549 cells, than in corresponding CD44low cells. High NRF2 expression in the CD44highCD24low CSC population (ADR44P) established from ADR cells depended on standard isoform of CD44. Silencing of CD44 or overexpression of CD44 resulted in the reduction or elevation of NRF2, respectively, and treatment with hyaluronic acid, a CD44 ligand, augmented NRF2 activation. As functional implications, NRF2 silencing rendered ADR44P cells to retain higher levels of reactive oxygen species and to be sensitive to anticancer drug toxicity. Moreover, NRF2-silenced ADR44P cells displayed tumor growth retardation and reduced colony/sphere formation and invasion capacity. In line with these, CD44 significantly colocalized with NRF2 in breast tumor clinical samples. The molecular mechanism of CD44-mediated NRF2 activation was found to involve high p62 expression. CD44 elevation led to an increase in p62, and inhibition of p62 resulted in NRF2 suppression in ADR44P. Collectively, our results showed that high CD44 led to p62-associated NRF2 activation in CD44high breast CSC-like cells. NRF2 activation contributed to the aggressive phenotype, tumor growth, and anticancer drug resistance of CD44high CSCs. Therefore, the CD44-NRF2 axis might be a promising therapeutic target for the control of stress resistance and survival of CD44high CSC population within breast tumors.",

     "abstract": "Accumulation of senescent cells over time contributes to aging and age-related diseases. However, what drives senescence in vivo is not clear. Here we used a genetic approach to determine if spontaneous nuclear DNA damage is sufficient to initiate senescence in mammals. Ercc1-/\u2206 mice with reduced expression of ERCC1-XPF endonuclease have impaired capacity to repair the nuclear genome. Ercc1-/\u2206 mice accumulated spontaneous, oxidative DNA damage more rapidly than wild-type (WT) mice. As a consequence, senescent cells accumulated more rapidly in Ercc1-/\u2206 mice compared to repair-competent animals. However, the levels of DNA damage and senescent cells in Ercc1-/\u2206 mice never exceeded that observed in old WT mice. Surprisingly, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased in tissues of Ercc1-/\u2206 mice to an extent identical to naturally-aged WT mice. Increased enzymatic production of ROS and decreased antioxidants contributed to the elevation in oxidative stress in both Ercc1-/\u2206 and aged WT mice. Chronic treatment of Ercc1-/\u2206 mice with the mitochondrial-targeted radical scavenger XJB-5\u2013131 attenuated oxidative DNA damage, senescence and age-related pathology. Our findings indicate that nuclear genotoxic stress arises, at least in part, due to mitochondrial-derived ROS, and this spontaneous DNA damage is sufficient to drive increased levels of ROS, cellular senescence, and the consequent age-related physiological decline.",

     "abstract": "The widespread detection of elevated oxidative stress levels in many medical conditions has led to numerous efforts to design interventions to reduce its effects. Efforts have been wide-ranging, from dietary changes to administration of antioxidants, supplements, e.g., omega-3-fatty acids, and many medications. However, there is still no systemic assessment of the efficacy of treatments for oxidative stress reduction across a variety of medical conditions.The goal of this meta-analysis is, by combining multiple studies, to quantitate the change in the levels of the popular oxidative stress biomarker 8-iso-prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1) after a variety of treatment strategies in human populations.Nearly 350 unique publications with 180 distinct strategies were included in the analysis. For each strategy, the difference between pre- or placebo and post-treatment levels calculated using Hedges\u2019 g value of effect. In general, administration of antibiotics, antihyperlipidemic agents, or changes in lifestyle (g = \u2212\u202f0.63, \u2212\u202f0.54, and 0.56) had the largest effect. Administration of supplements, antioxidants, or changes in diet (g = \u2212\u202f0.09, \u2212\u202f0.28, \u2212\u202f0.12) had small quantitative effects. To fully interpret the effectiveness of these treatments, comparisons to the increase in g value for each medical condition is required. For example, antioxidants in populations with coronary artery disease (CAD) reduce the 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels by g =\u202f\u2212\u202f0.34\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1, which is quantitatively considered a small effect. However, CAD populations, in comparison to healthy populations, have an increase in 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels by g =\u202f0.38\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04; therefore, the overall reduction of 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels is \u2248\u202f90% by this treatment in this specific medical condition.In conclusion, 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels can be reduced not only by antioxidants but by many other strategies. Not all strategies are equally effective at reducing 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels. In addition, the effectiveness of any strategy can be assessed only in relation to the medical condition investigated.",

However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate the critical role of the master redox transcription factor, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), in IPC-mediated neuroprotection and blood-brain barrier (BBB) preservation. We report that IPC causes generation of endogenous lipid electrophiles, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), which release Nrf2 from inhibition by Keap1 (via Keap1-C288) and inhibition by glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (via GSK3\u03b2-C199). Nrf2 then induces expression of its target genes, including a new target, cadherin 5, a key component of adherens junctions of the BBB. These effects culminate in mitigation of BBB leakage and of neurological deficits after stroke. Collectively, these studies are the first to demonstrate that IPC protects the BBB against ischemic injury by generation of endogenous electrophiles and activation of the Nrf2 pathway through inhibition of Keap1- and GSK3\u03b2-dependent Nrf2 degradation.",

     "abstract": "Over the last decades, the silent-killer carbon monoxide (CO) has been shown to also be an endogenous cytoprotective molecule able to inhibit cell death and modulate mitochondrial metabolism. Neuronal metabolism is mostly oxidative and neurons also use glucose for maintaining their anti-oxidant status by generation of reduced glutathione (GSH) via the pentose-phosphate pathway (PPP). It is established that neuronal differentiation depends on reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and signalling, however there is a lack of information about modulation of the PPP during adult neurogenesis. Thus, the main goal of this study was to unravel the role of CO on cell metabolism during neuronal differentiation, particularly by targeting PPP flux and GSH levels as anti-oxidant system.A human neuroblastoma SH-S5Y5 cell line was used, which differentiates into post-mitotic neurons by treatment with retinoic acid (RA), supplemented or not with CO-releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1). SH-SY5Y cell differentiation supplemented with CORM-A1 prompted an increase in neuronal yield production. It did, however, not alter glycolytic metabolism, but increased the PPP. In fact, CORM-A1 treatment stimulated (i) mRNA expression of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGDH) and transketolase (TKT), which are enzymes for oxidative and non-oxidative phases of the PPP, respectively and (ii) protein expression and activity of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP. Likewise, whenever G6PD was knocked-down CO-induced improvement on neuronal differentiation was reverted, while pharmacological inhibition of GSH synthesis did not change CO's effect on the improvement of neuronal differentiation. Both results indicate the key role of PPP in CO-modulation of neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, at the end of SH-SY5Y neuronal differentiation process, CORM-A1 supplementation increased the ratio of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) without alteration of GSH metabolism. These data corroborate with PPP stimulation. In conclusion, CO improves neuronal differentiation of SH-S5Y5 cells by stimulating the PPP and modulating the GSH system.",

     "abstract": "Dietary habits may strongly influence intestinal homeostasis. Oxysterols, the oxidized products of cholesterol present in cholesterol-containing foodstuffs, have been shown to exert pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory effects, altering intestinal epithelial layer and thus contributing to the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases and colon cancer. Extra virgin olive oil polyphenols possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, and concentrate in the intestinal lumen, where may help in preventing intestinal diseases. In the present study we evaluated the ability of an extra virgin olive oil phenolic extract to counteract the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory action of a representative mixture of dietary oxysterols in the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) undergoing full differentiation into enterocyte-like cells. Oxysterols treatment significantly altered differentiated Caco-2 cells redox status, leading to oxidant species production and a decrease of GSH levels, after 1\u202fh exposure, followed by an increase of cytokines production, IL-6 and IL-8, after 24\u202fh. Oxysterol cell treatment also induced after 48\u202fh an increase of NO release, due to the induction of iNOS. Pretreatment with the phenolic extract counteracted oxysterols effects, at least in part by modulating one of the main pathways activated in the cellular response to the action of oxysterols, the MAPK-NF-kB pathway. We demonstrated the ability of the phenolic extract to directly modulate p38 and JNK1/2 phosphorylation and activation of NF-kB, following its inhibitor IkB phosphorylation. The phenolic extract also inhibited iNOS induction, keeping NO concentration at the control level. Our results suggest a protective effect at intestinal level of extra virgin olive oil polyphenols, able to prevent or limit redox unbalance and the onset and progression of chronic intestinal inflammation.",

     "abstract": "Redox homeostasis involves factors that ensure proper function of cells. The excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) leads to oxidative stress and increased risk of oxidative damage to cellular components. In contrast, upon reductive stress, insufficient ROS abundance may result in faulty cell signalling. It may be expected that dietary antioxidants, depending on their standard reduction potentials (E\u00b0), will affect both scenarios. In our study, for the first time, we systematically tested the relationship among E\u00b0, chemical properties, and biological effects in HT29 cells for a series of structurally different catechins and a major endogenous antioxidant \u2013 glutathione (GSH), at both physiological and dietary concentrations. Among chemical antioxidant activity tests, the strongest correlation with E\u00b0 was seen using a DPPH assay. The values of E\u00b0 were also highly correlated with cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) values determined in HT29 cells. Our results indicated that physiological concentrations (1\u201310\u202f\u00b5M) of tested catechins stabilized the redox status of cells, which was not exhibited at higher concentrations. This stabilization of redox homeostasis was mirrored by constant, dose and E\u00b0 independent CAA values, uninhibited growth of HT29 cells, modulation of hydrogen peroxide-induced DNA damage, as well as effects at the genomic level, where either up-regulation of three redox-related genes (ALB, CCL5, and HSPA1A) out of 84 in the array (1\u202f\u00b5M) or no effect (10\u202f\u00b5M) was observed for catechins. Higher catechin concentrations (over 10\u202f\u00b5M) increased CAA values in a dose- and E\u00b0-dependent manner, caused cell growth inhibition, but surprisingly did not protect HT29 cells against reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, dose-dependent effects of dietary antioxidants and biological functions potentially modulated by them may become deregulated upon exposure to excessive doses.",

Oxidative modifications to protein thiols can alter the activity of metabolic enzymes, transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases, and the function of contractile proteins. However, the extent to which muscle contraction induces oxidative modifications in redox sensitive thiols is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine the targets of S-glutathionylation redox signaling following fatiguing contractions. Anesthetized adult male CB6F1 (BALB/cBy \u00d7 C57BL/6) mice were subjected to acute fatiguing contractions for 15\u202fmin using in vivo stimulations. The right (stimulated) and left (unstimulated) gastrocnemius muscleswere collected 60\u202fmin after the last stimulation and processed for redox proteomics assay of S-glutathionylation. Using selective reduction with a glutaredoxin enzyme cocktail and resin-assisted enrichment technique, we quantified the levels of site-specific protein S-glutathionylation at rest and following fatiguing contractions. Redox proteomics revealed over 2200 sites of S-glutathionylation modifications, of which 1290 were significantly increased after fatiguing contractions. Muscle contraction leads to the greatest increase in S-glutathionylation in the mitochondria (1.03%) and the smallest increase in the nucleus (0.47%). Regulatory cysteines were significantly S-glutathionylated on mitochondrial complex I and II, GAPDH, MDH1, ACO2, and mitochondrial complex V among others. Similarly, S-glutathionylation of RYR1, SERCA1, titin, and troponin I2 are known to regulate muscle contractility and were significantly S-glutathionylated after just 15\u202fmin of fatiguing contractions. The largest fold changes (> 1.6) in the S-glutathionylated proteome after fatigue occurred on signaling proteins such as 14-3-3 protein gamma and MAP2K4, as well as proteins like SERCA1, and NDUV2 of mitochondrial complex I, at previously unknown glutathionylation sites. These findings highlight the important role of redox control over muscle physiology, metabolism, and the exercise adaptive response. This study lays the groundwork for future investigation into the altered exercise adaptation associated with chronic conditions, such as sarcopenia.",

Although there are five superoxide dismutases in C. elegans, our genetic analyses suggest that SOD-1 is the primary superoxide dismutase to mediate the pathogen avoidance response. When C. elegans are fed a P. aeruginosa diet, the lack of SOD-1 contributes to enhanced lethality. We found that guanylyl cyclases GCY-5 and GCY-22 and neuropeptide receptor NPR-1 act antagonistically to regulate SOD-1 expression in the gustatory neuron ASER. After C. elegans ingests a diet that contributes to high levels of oxidative stress, the temporal regulation of SOD-1 and the SOD-1\u2013dependent response in the gustatory system demonstrates a sophisticated mechanism to fine-tune behavioral plasticity.

     "abstract": "The adaptive immune system plays a critical role in hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-accelerated atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that HHcy aggravates atherosclerosis with elevated oxidative stress and reduced S-nitrosylation level of redox-sensitive protein residues in the vasculature. However, whether and how S-nitrosylation contributes to T-cell-driven atherosclerosis remain unclear. In the present study, we report that HHcy reduced the level of protein S-nitrosylation in T cells by inducing S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR), the key denitrosylase that catalyzes S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), which is the main restored form of nitric oxide in vivo. Consequently, secretion of inflammatory cytokines [interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin-2] and proliferation of T cells were increased. GSNOR knockout or GSNO stimulation rectified HHcy-induced inflammatory cytokine secretion and T-cell proliferation. Site-directed mutagenesis of Akt at Cys224 revealed that S-nitrosylation at this site was pivotal for the reduced phosphorylation at Akt Ser473, which led to impaired Akt signaling. Furthermore, on HHcy challenge, as compared with GSNOR+/+ApoE-/- littermate controls, GSNOR-/-ApoE-/- double knockout mice showed reduced T-cell activation with concurrent reduction of atherosclerosis. Adoptive transfer of GSNOR-/- T cells to ApoE-/- mice fed homocysteine (Hcy) decreased atherosclerosis, with fewer infiltrated T cells and macrophages in plaques. In patients with HHcy and coronary artery disease, the level of plasma Hcy was positively correlated with Gsnor expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and IFN-\u03b3+ T cells but inversely correlated with the S-nitrosylation level in T cells. These data reveal that T cells are activated, in part via GSNOR-dependent Akt denitrosylation during HHcy-induced atherosclerosis. Thus, suppression of GSNOR in T cells may reduce the risk of atherosclerosis.",

The lack of published studies addressing the potential stimulation of pro-survival autophagy by oxysterols, a family of cholesterol oxidation products, has prompted our study. Thus, the goal of the current study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the autophagy induced by 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH), that is one of the most abundant oxysterols in advanced atherosclerotic lesions, and to assess whether the pro-oxidant effect of the oxysterol is involved in the given response. Here we showed that 27-OH, in a low micromolar range, activates a pro-survival autophagic response in terms of increased LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and Beclin 1, that depends on the up-regulation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways as a potential result of an intracellular reactive oxygen species increase provoked by the oxysterol in human promonocytic U937 cells. Moreover, 27-OH induced autophagy is dependent on the relation between nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent antioxidant response and p62.

     "abstract": "Cellular senescence plays essential roles in tissue homeostasis as well as a host of diseases ranging from cancers to age-related neurodegeneration. Various molecular pathways can induce senescence and these different pathways dictate the phenotypic and metabolic changes that accompany the transition to, and maintenance of, the senescence state. Here, we describe a novel senescence phenotype induced by depletion of UBE2E3, a highly-conserved, metazoan ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. Cells depleted of UBE2E3 become senescent in the absence of overt DNA damage and have a distinct senescence-associated secretory phenotype, increased mitochondrial and lysosomal mass, an increased sensitivity to mitochondrial and lysosomal poisons, and an increased basal autophagic flux. This senescence phenotype can be partially suppressed by co-depletion of either p53 or its cognate target gene, p21CIP1/WAF1, or by co-depleting the tumor suppressor p16INK4a. Together, these data describe a direct link of a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme to cellular senescence and further underscore the consequences of disrupting the integration between the ubiquitin proteolysis system and the autophagy machinery.",

Of note, certain oxysterols cause neuron dysfunction and degeneration but, recently, some of them have been shown also to have neuroprotective effects. The present study, which aimed to understand the potential effects of 24-hydroxycholesterol (24-OH) against the intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, stressed these latter effects. A beneficial effect of 24-OH was demonstrated in SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells, and is due to its ability to modulate the deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which contributes to preventing the neurotoxic accumulation of the hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Unlike 24-OH, 7-ketocholesterol (7-K) did not modulate the SIRT1-dependent neuroprotective pathway. To confirm the neuroprotective role of 24-OH, in vivo experiments were run on mice that express human tau without spontaneously developing tau pathology (hTau mice), by means of the intracerebroventricular injection of 24-OH. 24-OH, unlike 7-K, was found to completely prevent the hyperphosphorylation of tau induced by amyloid \u03b2 monomers. These data highlight the importance of preventing the loss of 24-OH in the brain, and of maintaining high levels of the enzyme SIRT1, in order to counteract neurodegeneration.A hypothetical scheme of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of 24-OH on hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation.

We thus used hephaestin (Heph) and ceruloplasmin (Cp) single-knockout mice and Heph/Cp double-knockout mice to investigate the roles of MCFs in pancreatic iron homeostasis. We found that both HEPH and CP were expressed in the mouse pancreas, and that ablation of either MCF had limited effect on the pancreatic iron levels. However, ablation of both MCFs together led to extensive pancreatic iron deposition and severe oxidative damage. Perls\u2019 Prussian blue staining revealed that this iron deposition was predominantly in the exocrine pancreas, while the islets were spared. Consistent with these results, plasma lipase and trypsin were elevated in Heph/Cp knockout mice, indicating damage to the exocrine pancreas, while insulin secretion was not affected. These data indicate that HEPH and CP play mutually compensatory roles in facilitating iron efflux from the exocrine pancreas, and show that MCFs are able to protect the pancreas against iron-induced oxidative damage.",

     "abstract": "Pathological cardiac remodeling during heart failure is associated with higher levels of lipid peroxidation products and lower abundance of several aldehyde detoxification enzymes, including aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2). An emerging idea that could explain these findings concerns the role of electrophilic species in redox signaling, which may be important for adaptive responses to stress or injury. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetically increasing ALDH2 activity affects pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction. Mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) for 12 weeks developed myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction, which were associated with diminished ALDH2 expression and activity. Cardiac-specific expression of the human ALDH2 gene in mice augmented myocardial ALDH2 activity but did not improve cardiac function in response to pressure overload. After 12 weeks of TAC, ALDH2 transgenic mice had larger hearts than their wild-type littermates and lower capillary density. These findings show that overexpression of ALDH2 augments the hypertrophic response to pressure overload and imply that downregulation of ALDH2 may be an adaptive response to certain forms of cardiac pathology.",

We found that under basal conditions, endogenous CHCHD4 redox state in cultured cells and mouse tissues was predominantly oxidized, however, degrees of oxidation in different tissues varied from 70% to 90% oxidized. To test whether differences in the ratio between CHCHD4 and ALR might explain tissue-specific differences in the CHCHD4 redox state, we determined the molar ratio of both proteins in different mouse tissues. Surprisingly, ALR is superstoichiometric over CHCHD4 in most tissues. However, the levels of CHCHD4 and the ratio of ALR over CHCHD4 appear to correlate only weakly with the redox state, and although ALR is present in superstoichiometric amounts, it does not lead to fully oxidized CHCHD4.",

Moreover, their immature respiratory, digestive, immune and antioxidant defense systems, as well as the potential numerous medical interventions following a preterm birth, such as oxygen resuscitation, nutrition, phototherapy and blood transfusion further contribute to high levels of OS. Although the acute effects seem well established, little is known regarding the long-term effects of preterm birth on OS. This matter is especially important given that chronically elevated OS levels may persist into adulthood and consequently contribute to the development of numerous non-communicable diseases observed in people born preterm such as diabetes, hypertension or lung disorders.

The current best practices for patients with acute ischemic stroke include intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and endovascular thrombectomy for large-vessel occlusion to improve clinical outcomes. However, only a limited portion of patients receive thrombolytic therapy or endovascular treatment because the therapeutic time window after ischemic stroke is narrow. To address the current shortage of stroke management approaches, it is critical to identify new potential therapeutic targets. The mitochondrion is an often overlooked target for the clinical treatment of stroke. Early studies of mitochondria focused on their bioenergetic role; however, these organelles are now known to be important in a wide range of cellular functions and signaling events. This review aims to summarize the current knowledge on the mitochondrial molecular mechanisms underlying cerebral ischemia and involved in reactive oxygen species generation and scavenging, electron transport chain dysfunction, apoptosis, mitochondrial dynamics and biogenesis, and inflammation. A better understanding of the roles of mitochondria in ischemia-related neuronal death and protection may provide a rationale for the development of innovative therapeutic regimens for ischemic stroke and other stroke syndromes.",

     "abstract": "The exact regulation of the liver-secreted peptide hepcidin, the key regulator of systemic iron homeostasis, is still poorly understood. It is potently induced by iron, inflammation, cytokines or H2O2 but conflicting results have been reported on hypoxia. In our current study, we first show that pronounced (1%) and mild (5%) hypoxia strongly induces hepcidin in human Huh7 hepatoma and primary liver cells predominantly at the transcriptional level via STAT3 using two hypoxia systems (hypoxia chamber and enzymatic hypoxia by the GOX/CAT system). SiRNA silencing of JAK1, STAT3 and NOX4 diminished the hypoxia-mediated effect while a role of HIF1\u03b1 could be clearly ruled out by the response to hypoxia-mimetics and competition experiments with a plasmid harboring the oxygen-dependent degradation domain of HIF1\u03b1. Specifically, hypoxia drastically enhances the H2O2-mediated induction of hepcidin strongly pointing towards an oxidase as powerful upstream control of hepcidin. We finally provide evidences for an efficient regulation of hepcidin expression by NADPH-dependent oxidase 4 (NOX4) in liver cells. In summary, our data demonstrate that hypoxia strongly potentiates the peroxide-mediated induction of hepcidin via STAT3 signaling pathway. Moreover, oxidases such as NOX4 or artificially overexpressed urate oxidase (UOX) can induce hepcidin. It remains to be studied whether the peroxide-STAT3-hepcidin axis simply acts to continuously compensate for oxygen fluctuations or is directly involved in iron sensing per se.",

Although probiotic bacteria have not yet fulfilled fully their promise in clinical trials, understanding the mechanism of how they exert beneficial effects will permit devising improved therapeutic strategies. Here we probe if one of the defining features of lactobacilli, the ability to generate nanomolar H2O2, contributes to their beneficial role in colitis. H2O2 generation by wild type L. johnsonii was modified by either deleting or overexpressing the enzymatic H2O2 source(s) followed by orally administering the bacteria before and during DSS colitis. Boosting luminal H2O2 concentrations within a physiological range accelerated recovery from colitis, while significantly exceeding this H2O2 level triggered bacteraemia. This study supports a role for increasing H2O2 within the physiological range at the epithelial barrier, independently of the enzymatic source and/or delivery mechanism, for inducing recovery and remission in IBD.",

     "abstract": "Short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), a family of gut microbial metabolites, have been reported to promote preservation of endothelial function and thereby exert anti-atherosclerotic action. However, the precise mechanism mediating this protective action of SCFAs remains unknown. The present study investigated the effects of SCFAs (acetate, propionate and butyrate) on the activation of Nod-like receptor pyrin domain 3 (Nlrp3) inflammasome in endothelial cells (ECs) and associated carotid neointima formation. Using a partial ligated carotid artery (PLCA) mouse model fed with the Western diet (WD), we found that butyrate significantly decreased Nlrp3 inflammasome formation and activation in the carotid arterial wall of wild type mice (Asc+/+), which was comparable to the effect of gene deletion of the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein gene (Asc-/-). Nevertheless, both acetate and propionate markedly enhanced the formation and activation of the Nlrp3 inflammasome as well as carotid neointima formation in the carotid arteries with PLCA in Asc+/+, but not Asc-/- mice. In cultured ECs (EOMA cells), butyrate was found to significantly decrease the formation and activation of Nlrp3 inflammasomes induced by 7-ketocholesterol (7-Ket) or cholesterol crystals (CHC), while acetate did not inhibit Nlrp3 inflammasome activation induced by either 7-Ket or CHC, but itself even activated Nlrp3 inflammsomes. Mechanistically, the inhibitory action of butyrate on the Nlrp3 inflammasome was attributed to a blockade of lipid raft redox signaling platforms to produce O2\u2022- upon 7-Ket or CHC stimulations. These results indicate that SCFAs have differential effects on endothelial Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and associated carotid neointima formation.",

However, the involvement of this process in tubular damage in the kidneys of patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) is unclear. Here, we demonstrated that mtROS overproduction is accompanied by decreases in TRX expression and TXNIP up-regulation. In addition, we discovered that mtROS overproduction is also associated with increases in NLRP3/IL-1\u03b2 and TGF-\u03b2 expression in the kidneys of patients with DN and db/db mice. We reversed these changes in db/db mice by administering a peritoneal injection of MitoQ, an antioxidant targeting mtROS. Similar results were observed in human tubular HK-2 cells subjected to high-glucose (HG) conditions and treated with MitoQ. Treating HK-2 cells with MitoQ suppressed the dissociation of TRX from TXNIP and subsequently blocked the interaction between TXNIP and NLRP3, leading to the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1\u03b2 maturation.

     "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is a promising target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the underlying mechanism has not yet been well elucidated. Additionally, most of current PDE4 inhibitors produce severe nausea and vomiting response in patients, which limit their clinical application. FCPR16 is a novel PDE4 inhibitor with little emetic potential. In the present study, the neuroprotective effect and underlying mechanism of FCPR16 against cellular apoptosis induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) were examined in SH-SY5Y cells. FCPR16 (12.5\u201350\u202f\u03bcM) dose-dependently reduced MPP+-induced loss of cell viability, accompanied by reductions in nuclear condensation and lactate dehydrogenase release. The level of cleaved caspase 3 and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 were also decreased after treatment with FCPR16 in MPP+-treated cells. Furthermore, FCPR16 (25\u202f\u03bcM) significantly suppressed the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), prevented the decline of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m) and attenuated the expression of malonaldehyde level. Further studies disclosed that FCPR16 enhanced the levels of cAMP and the exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (Epac) in SH-SY5Y cells. Western blotting analysis revealed that FCPR16 increased the phosphorylation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and protein kinase B (Akt) down-regulated by MPP+ in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of FCPR16 on the production of ROS and \u0394\u03c8m loss could be blocked by PKA inhibitor H-89 and Akt inhibitor KRX-0401. Collectively, these results suggest that FCPR16 attenuates MPP+-induced dopaminergic degeneration via lowering ROS and preventing the loss of \u0394\u03c8m in SH-SY5Y cells. Mechanistically, cAMP/PKA/CREB and Epac/Akt signaling pathways are involved in these processes. Our findings indicate that FCPR16 is a promising pre-clinical candidate for the treatment of PD and possibly other oxidative stress-related neuronal diseases.",

Although generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is considered a major danger signal responsible for DC maturation, the mechanisms leading to cellular redox imbalance remain poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to unveil the origin and kinetics of redox imbalance elicited by 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB) and trimellitic anhydride chloride (TMAC), two golden standards of skin and chemical respiratory allergy, respectively. To track this goal, we addressed the time course modifications of ROS production and cellular antioxidant defenses as well as the modulation of MAPKs signaling pathways and transcription of pathophysiological relevant genes in THP-1 cells. Our data shows that the thiol-reactive sensitizer DNFB directly reacts with cytoplasmic glutathione (GSH) causing its rapid and marked depletion which results in a general increase in ROS accumulation. In turn, TMAC, which preferentially reacts with amine groups, induces a delayed GSH depletion as a consequence of increased mitochondrial ROS production. These divergences in ROS production seem to be correlated with the different extension of intracellular signaling pathways activation and, by consequence, with distinct transcription kinetics of genes such as HMOX1, IL8, IL1B and CD86. Ultimately, our observations may help explain the distinct DC phenotype and T-cell polarizing profile triggered by skin and respiratory sensitizers.",

Further study revealed that XBP1s activated Gdf15 transcription via binding to its promoter. Elevated GDF15 in liver reduced lipid accumulation and impaired NALFD development in obese mice through enhancing fatty acids oxidation in liver.

     "abstract": "Vascular calcification is prevalent in patients with atherosclerosis, and oxidative stress promotes pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We have previously reported that activation of AKT by oxidative stress induces vascular calcification. Using sodium dichloroacetate (DCA), a previously reported small molecule inhibitor of AKT, the present studies uncovered an AKT-independent mechanism in regulating vascular calcification.We found that DCA dose-dependently induced calcification of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in vitro and aortic rings ex vivo. Furthermore, DCA markedly enhanced vascular calcification in atherosclerotic ApoE knockout mice in vivo. DCA-induced VSMC calcification was associated with increased Runx2, but not via activation of AKT, a key upstream signal that upregulates Runx2 during VSMC calcification. In contrast, DCA inhibited AKT activation and induced activation of p38 MAPK in calcified atherosclerotic lesions in vivo and calcified VSMC in vitro. Using a pharmacological inhibitor and shRNA for p38 MAPK, we demonstrated that inhibition of p38 MAPK blocked DCA-induced Runx2 upregulation and VSMC calcification. Furthermore, Runx2 deletion attenuated DCA-induced VSMC calcification. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed association of p38 MAPK with Runx2, which was enhanced by DCA treatment. Knockdown p38 MAPK inhibited DCA-induced Runx2 transactivity, supporting the function of p38 MAPK in regulating Runx2 transactivity.Our studies have uncovered a new function of DCA in regulating vascular calcification, via AKT-independent activation of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, we have identified novel interaction between p38 MAPK and Runx2 enhances Runx2 transactivity, thus promoting VSMC calcification. These results revealed a novel signaling mechanism underlying DCA-induced vascular calcification, and offer opportunities to identify new therapeutic targets.",

In this study, we found that ROS formation and expression of p47phox and p67phox, subunits of NADPH oxidase, were increased in AppTg mice but attenuated in AppTg/Cebpd-/- mice. Cebpd can up-regulate p47phox and p67phox transcription via a direct binding on their promoters, which results in an increase in intracellular oxidative stress. In addition, Cebpd also up-regulated Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Sod1) in astrocytes. Inactivation of Sod1 increased the sensitization to oxidative stress, which provides a reason for the resistance of astrocytes in an oxidative stress environment. Taken together, the study first revealed and dissected the involvement of astrocytic Cebpd in the promotion of oxidative stress and the contribution of CEBPD to the resistance of astrocytes in an oxidative stress environment.",

This study focused on glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx1) expression and the impact of carbonylation as an oxidative protein modification on GPx1 abundance and activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) under conditions of mild to moderate oxidative stress.High extracellular glucose and MG enhanced intracellular ROS formation in HUVECs. Protein carbonylation was only transiently augmented pointing to an effective antioxidant defense in these cells. Nitric oxide synthase expression was decreased under hyperglycemic conditions but increased upon exposure to MG, whereas superoxide dismutase expression was not significantly affected. Increased glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity seemed to compensate for a decrease in GPx1 protein due to enhanced degradation via the proteasome. Mass spectrometry analysis identified Lys-114 as a possible carbonylation target which provides a vestibule for the substrate H2O2 and thus enhances the enzymatic reaction.Oxidative protein carbonylation has so far been associated with functional inactivation of modified target proteins mainly contributing to aging and age-related diseases. Here, we demonstrate that mild oxidative stress and subsequent carbonylation seem to activate protective cellular redox signaling pathways whereas severe oxidative stress overwhelms the cellular antioxidant defense leading to cell damage.This study may contribute to a better understanding of redox homeostasis and its role in the development of diabetes and related vascular complications.",

Low fluxes of antimycin A-stimulated ROS production caused dimerization of mitochondrial peroxiredoxin 3 and cytosolic peroxiredoxin 2, but not peroxiredoxin overoxidation and overall oxidation of cellular protein thiols. This moderate redox imbalance was sufficient to inhibit the ATP stimulation of 26S proteasome activity. This process was dependent on reversible cysteine oxidation.

     "abstract": "Inflammation has been implicated in a variety of retinal diseases. The immunoproteasome plays a critical role in controlling inflammatory responses, but whether activation of immunoproteasome contributes to angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced retinopathy remains unclear. Hypertensive retinopathy (HR) was induced by infusion of Ang II (3000\u202fng/kg/min) in wild-type (WT) and immunoproteasome subunit LMP10 knockout (KO) mice for 3 weeks. Changes in retinal morphology, vascular permeability, superoxide production and inflammation were examined by pathological staining. Our results showed that immunoproteasome subunit LMP10 expression and its trypsin-like activity were significantly upregulated in the retinas and serum of Ang II-infused mice and in the serum from patients with hypertensive retinopathy. Moreover, Ang II-infused WT mice showed an increase in the central retinal thickness, vascular permeability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inflammation compared with saline controls, and these effects were significantly attenuated in LMP10 KO mice, but were aggravated in mice intravitreally injected with rAAV2-LMP10. Interestingly, administration of IKK\u03b2 specific inhibitor IMD-0354 remarkably blocked an Ang II-induced increase in vascular permeability, oxidative stress and inflammation during retinopathy. Mechanistically, Ang II-induced upregulation of LMP10 promoted PTEN degradation and activation of AKT/IKK signaling, which induced IkB\u03b1 phosphorylation and subsequent degradation ultimately leading to activation of NF-kB target genes in retinopathy. Therefore, this study provided novel evidence demonstrating that LMP10 is a positive regulator of NF-kB signaling, which contributes to Ang II-induced retinopathy. Strategies for inhibiting LMP10 or IKK\u03b2 activity in the eye could serve as a novel therapeutic target for treating hypertensive retinopathy.",

Oxysterols are more soluble than cholesterol and are reported to exert inflammatory, cytoprotective and apoptotic effects according to concentration and species. Esterified oxysterols have been analysed in people with dementia and cardiovascular diseases although there is no consistent relationship between oxysterol esters and disease. However, oxysterol esters are held in lipoprotein core and may not relate to the concentration and activity of plasma free oxysterols. Methodological limitations have challenged the analysis of free oxysterols to date.We have developed a fast, sensitive and specific quantitative LC-MS/MS, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) method to target five oxysterols in human plasma with analyte recoveries between 72% and 82% and sensitivities between 5 and 135\u202fpg/ml. A novel method was used to investigate the hypothesis that simvastatin may reduce the concentrations of specific plasma free oxysterols in hypercholesterolaemia.Twenty healthy male volunteers were recruited (aged 41\u201363 years); ten were asymptomatic with high plasma cholesterol >\u202f6.5\u202fmM and ten were healthy with normal plasma cholesterol (<\u202f6.5\u202fmM). Simvastatin (40\u202fmg/day) was prescribed to those with hypercholesterolaemia. Plasma samples were taken from both groups at baseline and after three months. Simvastatin reduced plasma cholesterol by ~35% (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) at the end of three months.Oxysterols generated by autoxidation (but not enzymatically) were elevated up to 45 fold in hypercholesterolaemic midlife men. Plasma oxysterols were restored to those of healthy controls after simvastatin intervention suggesting that autoxidation is either prevented by simvastatin directly or that autoxidation is less prevalent when plasma cholesterol concentrations are within the normal range.",

How ENDOG controls cardiomyocyte growth is still unknown. Thus, we aimed at finding the link between ENDOG activity and cardiomyocyte growth. Endog deficiency induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and abnormal growth in neonatal rodent cardiomyocytes, altering the AKT-GSK3\u03b2 and Class-II histone deacethylases (HDAC) signal transduction pathways. These effects were blocked by ROS scavengers. Lack of ENDOG reduced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication independently of ROS accumulation. Because mtDNA encodes several subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, whose activity is an important source of cellular ROS, we investigated whether Endog deficiency compromised the expression and activity of the respiratory chain complexes but found no changes in these parameters nor in ATP content. MtDNA also codes for humanin, a micropeptide with possible metabolic functions. Nanomolar concentrations of synthetic humanin restored normal ROS levels and cell size in Endog-deficient cardiomyocytes. These results support the involvement of redox signaling in the control of cardiomyocyte growth by ENDOG and suggest a pathway relating mtDNA content to the regulation of cell growth probably involving humanin, which prevents reactive oxygen radicals accumulation and hypertrophy induced by Endog deficiency.",

The higher level of Ripk3 was positively correlated to the infarction area expansion, cardiac dysfunction and augmented cardiomyocytes necroptosis. Function study further illustrated that upregulated Ripk3 evoked the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which was accompanied with an increase in intracellular Ca2+ level ([Ca2+]c) and xanthine oxidase (XO) expression. Activated XO raised cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) that mediated the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and cardiomyocytes necroptosis. By comparison, genetic ablation of Ripk3 abrogated the ER stress and thus blocked the [Ca2+]c overload-XO-ROS-mPTP pathways, favouring a pro-survival state that ultimately resulted in the inhibition of cardiomyocytes necroptosis in the setting of cardiac IR injury.

Intraperitoneal or oral (via drinking water) administration of acteoside in a melanoma mouse model upregulated antioxidant responses in the tumors; yet, only intraperitoneal delivery suppressed tumor growth and induced anti-tumor-reactive immune responses. Mass-spectrometry identification/quantitation analyses revealed that intraperitoneal delivery of acteoside resulted in significantly higher, vs. oral administration, concentration of the compound in the plasma and tumors of treated mice, suggesting that its in vivo anti-tumor effect depends on the route of administration and the achieved concentration in the tumor.

Fluorescence microscopy showed that uric acid also decreased the levels of HOCl produced by dHL-60 cells, while significantly increased superoxide production. Uric acid did not alter the overall oxidative status of dHL-60 cells as measured by the ratio of reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione. Our data show that uric acid impairs the killing activity of dHL-60 cells likely by competing with chloride by myeloperoxidase catalysis, decreasing HOCl production. Despite diminishing HOCl, uric acid probably stimulates the formation of other oxidants, maintaining the overall oxidative status of the cells. Altogether, our results demonstrated that HOCl is, indeed, the main relevant oxidant against bacteria and deviation of myeloperoxidase activity to produce other oxidants hampers dHL-60 killing activity.",

     "abstract": "Clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX) is limited because of its cardiotoxicity. Thus, exploration of effective lead compounds against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity is necessary. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects and possible mechanisms of dioscin against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The in vitro model of DOX- treated H9C2 cells and the in vivo models of DOX-treated rats and mice were used in this study. The results showed that discoin markedly increased H9C2 cell viability, decreased the levels of CK, LDH, and improved histopathological and electrocardio- gram changes in rats and mice to protect DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Furthermore, dioscin significantly inhibited myocardial oxidative insult through adjusting the levels of intracellular ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH and GSH-Px in vitro and in vivo. Our data also indicated that dioscin activated Nrf2 and Sirt2 signaling pathways, and thereby affected the expression levels of HO-1, NQO1, Gst, GCLM, Keap1 and FOXO3a through decreasing miR-140-5p expression level. In addition, the level of intracellular ROS was significantly increased in H9C2 cells treated by DOX after miR-140-5p mimic transfection, as well as the down-regulated expression levels of Nrf2 and Sirt2, which were markedly reversed by dioscin. In conclusion, our data suggested that dioscin alleviated DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through modulating miR-140-5p-mediated myocardial oxidative stress. This natural product should be developed as a new candidate to alleviate cardiotoxicity caused by DOX in the future.",

Redox balance is the resultant of metabolic functioning under environmental inputs (i.e. diet, pollution) and the activity of intrinsic antioxidant machinery. Monitoring of intracellular hydrogen peroxide has been successfully achieved by redox biosensor advent; however, to track the intrinsic disulfide bond reduction capacity represents a fundamental piece to understand better how redox homeostasis is maintained in living cells.In the present work, we compared the informative value of steady-state measurements and the kinetics of HyPer, a H2O2-sensitive fluorescent biosensor, targeted at the cytosol, mitochondrion and endoplasmic reticulum. From this set of data, biosensor signal recovery from an oxidized state raised as a suitable parameter to discriminate reducing capacity of a close environment. Biosensor recovery was pH-independent, condition demonstrated by experiments on pH-clamped cells, and sensitive to pharmacological perturbations of enzymatic disulfide reduction. Also, ten human cell lines were characterized according their H2O2-pulse responses, including their capacity to reduce disulfide bonds evaluated in terms of their migratory capacity.Finally, cellular migration experiments were conducted to study whether migratory efficiency was associated with the disulfide reduction activity. The migration efficiency of each cell type correlates with the rate of signal recovery measured from the oxidized biosensor. In addition, HyPer-expressing cells treated with N-acetyl-cysteine had accelerated recovery rates and major migratory capacities, both reversible effects upon treatment removal. Our data demonstrate that the HyPer signal recovery offers a novel methodological tool to track the cellular impact of redox active biomolecules.",

NDH-2s are members of the two-Dinucleotide Binding Domains Flavoprotein (tDBDF) superfamily, having a flavin adenine dinucleotide, FAD, as prosthetic group and NAD(P)H as substrate. The establishment of a Charge-Transfer Complex (CTC) between the isoalloxazine ring of the reduced flavin and the nicotinamide ring of NAD+ in NDH-2 was described, and in this work we explored its role in the kinetic mechanism using different electron donors and electron acceptors. We observed that CTC slows down the rate of the second half reaction (quinone reduction) and determines the effect of HQNO, an inhibitor. Also, protonation equilibrium simulations clearly indicate that the protonation probability of an important residue for proton transfer to the active site (D302) is influenced by the presence of the CTC. We propose that CTC is critical for the overall mechanism of NDH-2 and possibly relevant to keep a low quinol/quinone ratio and avoid excessive ROS production in vivo.",

We investigated the role of H2S in T2DM and HHcy-induced endothelial dysfunction in small mesenteric artery (SMA) of db/db mice fed a high methionine (HM) diet. HM diet (8 weeks) induced HHcy in both T2DM db/db mice and non-diabetic db/+ mice (total plasma Hcy: 48.4 and 31.3\u202f\u00b5M, respectively), and aggravated the impaired endothelium-derived hyperpolarization factor (EDHF)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine (ACh), determined by the presence of eNOS inhibitor N(\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and prostacyclin (PGI2) inhibitor indomethacin (INDO), in SMA from db/db mice but not that from db/+ mice. A non-selective Ca2+-active potassium channel (KCa) opener NS309 rescued T2DM/HHcy-impaired EDHF-mediated vascular relaxation to ACh. EDHF-induced relaxation to ACh was inhibited by a non-selective KCa blocker TEA and intermediate-conductance KCa blocker (IKCa) Tram-34, but not by small-conductance KCa (SKCa) blocker Apamin. HHcy potentiated the reduction of free sulfide, H2S and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase protein, which converts L-cysteine to H2S, in SMA of db/db mice. Importantly, a stable H2S donor DATS diminished the enhanced O2- production in SMAs and lung endothelial cells of T2DM/HHcy mice. Antioxidant PEG-SOD and DATS improved T2DM/HHcy impaired relaxation to ACh. Moreover, HHcy increased hyperglycemia-induced IKCa tyrosine nitration in human micro-vascular endothelial cells. EDHF-induced vascular relaxation to L-cysteine was not altered, whereas such relaxation to NaHS was potentiated by HHcy in SMA of db/db mice which was abolished by ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker Glycolamide but not by KCa blockers.Intermediate HHcy potentiated H2S reduction via CSE-downregulation in microvasculature of T2DM mice. H2S is justified as an EDHF. Insufficient H2S impaired EDHF-induced vascular relaxation via oxidative stress and IKCa inactivation in T2DM/HHcy mice. H2S therapy may be beneficial for prevention and treatment of micro-vascular complications in patients with T2DM and HHcy.",

Radioresistance of thyroid cancer often leads to therapy failure and cancer-related death. In this study, we found that melatonin showed potent suppressive roles on NF-\u03baB signaling via inhibition of p65 phosphorylation and generated redox stress in thyroid cancer including the anaplastic subtypes. Our data showed that melatonin significantly decreased cell viability, suppressed cell migration and induced apoptosis in thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro and impaired tumor growth in the subcutaneous mouse model in vivo. By contrast, irradiation of thyroid cancer cells resulted in elevated level of phosphorylated p65, which could be reversed by cotreatment with melatonin. Consequently, melatonin synergized with irradiation to induce cytotoxicity to thyroid cancer, especially in the undifferentiated subgroups. Taken together, our results suggest that melatonin may exert anti-tumor activities against thyroid carcinoma by inhibition of p65 phosphorylation and induction of reactive oxygen species. Radio-sensitization by melatonin may have clinical benefits in thyroid cancer.",

This is proposed to represent a neuronal protective response, although the mechanism has not yet been identified. We have generated a transgenic zebrafish line with increased astroglial DJ-1 expression driven by regulatory elements from the zebrafish GFAP gene. Larvae from this transgenic line are protected from oxidative stress-induced injuries as caused by MPP+, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor shown to induce dopaminergic cells death. In a global label-free proteomics analysis of wild type and transgenic larvae exposed to MPP+, 3418 proteins were identified, in which 366 proteins were differentially regulated. In particular, we identified enzymes belonging to primary metabolism to be among proteins affected by MPP+ in wild type animals, but not affected in the transgenic line. Moreover, by performing protein profiling on isolated astrocytes we showed that an increase in astrocytic DJ-1 expression up-regulated a large group of proteins associated with redox regulation, inflammation and mitochondrial respiration. The majority of these proteins have also been shown to be regulated by Nrf2. These findings provide a mechanistic insight into the protective role of astroglial up-regulation of DJ-1 and show that our transgenic zebrafish line with astrocytic DJ-1 over-expression can serve as a useful animal model to understand astrocyte-regulated neuroprotection associated with oxidative stress-related neurodegenerative disease.",

Since treatments for hyperglycemia and hypertension do not prevent podocyte loss, there must be additional factors causing podocyte depletion. The role of oxidative stress has been implicated in CKD but it is not known how exactly free radicals affect podocyte physiology. To assess this relationship, we investigated the effects of lipid radicals on podocytes, as lipid peroxidation is a major form of oxidative stress in diabetes. We found that lipid radicals govern changes in podocyte homeostasis through redox sensitive RhoA signaling: lipid radicals inhibit migration and cause loss of F-actin fibers. These effects were prevented by mutating the redox sensitive cysteines of RhoA. We therefore suggest that in diseases associated with increased lipid peroxidation, lipid radicals can determine podocyte function with potentially pathogenic consequences for kidney physiology.",

LOX-1 was established to be a direct target of miR-98 by luciferase reporter assay. Enhancement of miR-98 decreased the expression of LOX-1 and inhibited foam cell formation and lipid accumulation. Inhibition of miR-98 had the opposite effects on all parameters.Reduced expression of miR-98 may relate to LOX-1 expression and foam cell formation and lipid accumulation in aortas of ApoE-/- mice.

     "abstract": "p38\u03b1 is a redox sensitive MAPK activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and environmental, genotoxic and endoplasmic reticulum stresses. The aim of this work was to assess whether p38\u03b1 controls the antioxidant defense in the liver, and if so, to elucidate the mechanism(s) involved and the age-related changes. For this purpose, we used liver-specific p38\u03b1-deficient mice at two different ages: young-mice (4 months-old) and old-mice (24 months-old). The liver of young p38\u03b1 knock-out mice exhibited a decrease in GSH levels and an increase in GSSG/GSH ratio and malondialdehyde levels. However, old mice deficient in p38\u03b1 had higher hepatic GSH levels and lower GSSG/GSH ratio than young p38\u03b1 knock-out mice. Liver-specific p38\u03b1 deficiency triggered a dramatic down-regulation of the mRNAs of the key antioxidant enzymes glutamate cysteine ligase, superoxide dismutase 1, superoxide dismutase 2, and catalase in young mice, which seems mediated by the lack of p65 recruitment to their promoters. Nrf-2 nuclear levels did not change significantly in the liver of young mice upon p38\u03b1 deficiency, but nuclear levels of phospho-p65 and PGC-1\u03b1 decreased in these mice. p38\u03b1-dependent activation of NF-\u03baB seems to occur through classical I\u03baB Kinase and via ribosomal S6 kinase1 and AKT in young mice. However, unexpectedly the long-term deficiency in p38\u03b1 triggers a compensatory up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes via NF-\u03baB activation and recruitment of p65 to their promoters. In conclusion, p38\u03b1 MAPK maintains the expression of antioxidant genes in liver of young animals via NF-\u03ba\u0392 under basal conditions, whereas its long-term deficiency triggers compensatory up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes through NF-\u03ba\u0392.",

The aim of this work was to study the extent of the protective effect of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) over the proinflammatory state (IL-6 and IL-8), oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species, ROS), and CFTR levels, caused by Cigarette Smoke Extract (CSE) in Calu-3 airway epithelial cells. CSE treatment (100\u202f\u00b5g/ml during 24\u202fh) decreased CFTR mRNA expression and activity, and increased the release of IL-6 and IL-8. The effect on these cytokines was inhibited by N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 5\u202fmM) or the NF-kB inhibitor, IKK-2 (10\u202f\u00b5M). CSE treatment also increased cellular and mitochondrial ROS levels. The cellular ROS levels were normalized to control values by NAC treatment, although significant effects on mitochondrial ROS levels were observed only at short times (5\u00b4) and effects on CFTR levels were not observed. In addition, CSE reduced the mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (mCx I-III) activity, an effect that was not reverted by NAC. The reduced CFTR expression and the mitochondrial damage induced by CSE could not be normalized by NAC treatment, evidencing the need for a more specific reagent.

     "abstract": "The accumulation of uremic toxins in chronic kidney disease (CKD) induces inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which is a key step in atherosclerosis. Accumulating evidence indicates increased mitochondrial fission is a contributing mechanism for impaired endothelial function. Hippurate, a uremic toxin, has been reported to be involved in cardiovascular diseases. Here, we assessed the endothelial toxicity of hippurate and the contribution of altered mitochondrial dynamics to hippurate-induced endothelial dysfunction.Treatment of human aortic endothelial cells with hippurate reduced the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and increased the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and von Willebrand factor (vWF). The mechanisms of hippurate-induced endothelial dysfunction in vitro depended on the activation of Dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-mediated mitochondrial fission and overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS). In a rat model in which CKD was induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (CKD rat), we observed increased oxidative stress, impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and elevated soluble biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction (ICAM-1 and vWF). Similarly, endothelial dysfunction was identified in healthy rats treated with disease-relevant concentrations of hippurate. In aortas of CKD rats and hippurate-treated rats, we observed an increase in Drp1 protein levels and mitochondrial fission. Inhibition of Drp1 improved endothelial function in both rat models.These results indicate that hippurate, by itself, can cause endothelial dysfunction. Increased mitochondrial fission plays an active role in hippurate-induced endothelial dysfunction via an increase in mitoROS.",

     "abstract": "Collagen IV is a major component of the basement membrane in epithelial tissues. The NC1 domains of collagen IV protomers are covalently linked together through sulfilimine bonds, the formation of which is catalyzed by peroxidasin. Although hydrogen peroxide is essential for this reaction, the exact source of the oxidant remains elusive. Members of the NOX/DUOX NADPH oxidase family are specifically devoted to the production of superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Our aim in this study was to find out if NADPH oxidases contribute in vivo to the formation of collagen IV sulfilimine crosslinks. We used multiple genetically modified in vivo model systems to provide a detailed assessment of this question. Our data indicate that in various peroxidasin-expressing tissues sulfilimine crosslinks between the NC1 domains of collagen IV can be readily detected in the absence of functioning NADPH oxidases. We also analyzed how subatmospheric oxygen levels influence the collagen IV network in collagen-producing cultured cells with rapid matrix turnover. We showed that collagen IV crosslinks remain intact even under strongly hypoxic conditions. Our hypothesis is that during collagen IV network formation PXDN cooperates with a NOX/DUOX-independent H2O2 source that is functional also at very low ambient oxygen levels.",

     "abstract": "Cellular senescence is characterized by irreversible growth arrest incurred through either replicative exhaustion or by pro-oncogenic cellular stressors (radioactivity, oxidative stress, oncogenic activation). The enrichment of senescent cells in tissues with age has been associated with tissue dyshomeostasis and age-related pathologies including cancers, neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, etc.) and metabolic disorders (e.g. diabetes). We identified copper accumulation as being a universal feature of senescent cells [mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), human prostate epithelial cells and human diploid fibroblasts] in vitro. Elevated copper in senescent MEFs was accompanied by elevated levels of high-affinity copper uptake protein 1 (Ctr1), diminished levels of copper-transporting ATPase 1 (Atp7a) (copper export) and enhanced antioxidant defence reflected by elevated levels of glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1). The levels of intracellular copper were further increased in senescent MEFs cultured in copper supplemented medium and in senescent Mottled Brindled (Mobr) MEFs lacking functional Atp7a. Finally, we demonstrated that the restoration/preservation of autophagic-lysosomal degradation in senescent MEFs following rapamycin treatment correlated with attenuation of copper accumulation in these cells despite a further decrease in Atp7a levels. This study for the first time establishes a link between Atp7a and the autophagic-lysosomal pathway, and a requirement for both to effect efficient copper export. Such a connection between cellular autophagy and copper homeostasis is significant, as both have emerged as important facets of age-associated degenerative disease.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by up-regulated NADPH oxidase (Nox) contribute to structural-functional alterations of the vascular wall in diabetes. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone acetylation, emerged as important regulators of gene expression in cardiovascular disorders. Since their role in diabetes is still elusive we hypothesized that histone deacetylase (HDAC)-dependent mechanisms could mediate vascular Nox overexpression in diabetic conditions. Non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic C57BL/6J mice were randomized to receive vehicle or suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), a pan-HDAC inhibitor. In vitro studies were performed on a human aortic smooth muscle cell (SMC) line. Aortic SMCs typically express Nox1, Nox4, and Nox5 subtypes. HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins along with Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 levels were found significantly elevated in the aortas of diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic animals. Treatment of diabetic mice with SAHA mitigated the aortic expression of Nox1, Nox2, and Nox4 subtypes and NADPH-stimulated ROS production. High concentrations of glucose increased HDAC1 and HDAC2 protein levels in cultured SMCs. SAHA significantly reduced the high glucose-induced Nox1/4/5 expression, ROS production, and the formation malondialdehyde-protein adducts in SMCs. Overexpression of HDAC2 up-regulated the Nox1/4/5 gene promoter activities in SMCs. Physical interactions of HDAC1/2 and p300 proteins with Nox1/4/5 promoters were detected at the sites of active transcription. High glucose induced histone H3K27 acetylation enrichment at the promoters of Nox1/4/5 genes in SMCs. The novel data of this study indicate that HDACs mediate vascular Nox up-regulation in diabetes. HDAC inhibition reduces vascular ROS production in experimental diabetes, possibly by a mechanism involving negative regulation of Nox expression.",

     "abstract": "Several diseases are associated with perturbations in redox signaling and aberrant hydrogen sulfide metabolism, and numerous analytical methods exist for the measurement of the sulfur-containing species affected. However, uncertainty remains about their concentrations and speciation in cells/biofluids, perhaps in part due to differences in sample processing and detection principles. Using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography in combination with electrospray-ionization tandem mass spectrometry we here outline a specific and sensitive platform for the simultaneous measurement of 12 analytes, including total and free thiols, their disulfides and sulfide in complex biological matrices such as blood, saliva and urine. Total assay run time is <\u202f10\u202fmin, enabling high-throughput analysis. Enhanced sensitivity and avoidance of artifactual thiol oxidation is achieved by taking advantage of the rapid reaction of sulfhydryl groups with N-ethylmaleimide. We optimized the analytical procedure for detection and separation conditions, linearity and precision including three stable isotope labelled standards. Its versatility for future more comprehensive coverage of the thiol redox metabolome was demonstrated by implementing additional analytes such as methanethiol, N-acetylcysteine, and coenzyme A. Apparent plasma sulfide concentrations were found to vary substantially with sample pretreatment and nature of the alkylating agent. In addition to protein binding in the form of mixed disulfides (S-thiolation) a significant fraction of aminothiols and sulfide appears to be also non-covalently associated with proteins. Methodological accuracy was tested by comparing the plasma redox status of 10 healthy human volunteers to a well-established protocol optimized for reduced/oxidized glutathione. In a proof-of-principle study a deeper analysis of the thiol redox metabolome including free reduced/oxidized as well as bound thiols and sulfide was performed. Additional determination of acid-labile sulfide/thiols was demonstrated in human blood cells, urine and saliva. Using this simplified mass spectrometry-based workflow the thiol redox metabolome can be determined in samples from clinical and translational studies, providing a novel prognostic/diagnostic platform for patient stratification, drug monitoring, and identification of new therapeutic approaches in redox diseases.",

Fluorescence activated cell sorting, or FACS, is a widely used experimental approach to purify specific cell types from complex heterogeneous samples. Here we show that FACS introduces oxidative stress and alters the metabolic state of cells. Compared to unsorted controls, astrocytes subjected to FACS prior to metabolomic analysis showed altered ratios of GSSG to GSH, NADPH to NADP+, and NAD+ to NADH. Additionally, a 50% increase in reactive oxygen species was observed in astrocytes subjected to FACS relative to unsorted controls. At a more comprehensive scale, nearly half of the metabolomic features that we profiled by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry were changed by at least 1.5-fold in intensity due to cell sorting. Some specific metabolites identified to have significantly altered levels as a result of cell sorting included glycogen, nucleosides, amino acids, central carbon metabolites, and acylcarnitines. Although the addition of fetal bovine serum to the cell-sorting buffer decreased oxidative stress and attenuated changes in metabolite concentrations, fetal bovine serum did not preserve the metabolic state of the cells during FACS. We conclude that, irrespective of buffer components and data-normalization strategies we examined, metabolomic results from sorted cells do not accurately reflect physiological conditions prior to sorting.",

     "abstract": "Ganoderma lucidum has high commercial value because it produces many active compounds, such as ganoderic acids (GAs). Salicylic acid (SA) was previously reported to induce the biosynthesis of GA in G. lucidum. In this study, we found that SA induces GA biosynthesis by increasing ROS production, and further research found that NADPH oxidase-silenced strains exhibited a partial reduction in the response to SA, resulting in the induction of increased ROS production. Furthermore, the localization of ROS shows that mitochondria are sources of ROS production in response to SA treatment. An additional analysis focused on the relationship between SA-induced ROS production and mitochondrial functions, and the results showed that inhibitors of mitochondrial complexes I and II exert approximately 40\u201350% superimposed inhibitory effects on the respiration rate and H2O2 content when co-administered with SA. However, no obvious superimposed inhibition effects were observed in the sample co-treated with mitochondrial complex III inhibitor and SA, implying that the inhibitor of mitochondrial complex III and SA might act on the same site in mitochondria. Additional experiments revealed that complex III activity was decreased 51%, 62% and 75% after treatment with 100, 200, and 400\u202f\u00b5M SA, respectively. Our results highlight the finding that SA inhibits mitochondrial complex III activity to increase ROS generation. In addition, inhibition of mitochondrial complex III caused ROS accumulation, which plays an essential role in SA-mediated GA biosynthesis in G. lucidum. This conclusion was also demonstrated in complex III-silenced strains. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first demonstration that SA inhibits complex III activity to increase the ROS levels and thereby regulate secondary metabolite biosynthesis.",

The lack of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) exacerbates cardiovascular disease phenotypes driven by increased oxidative stress. However, the role of MsrA on maintaining cellular homeostasis in the absence of excessive oxidative stress is less well understood.Constitutive genetic deletion of MsrA increased formation of p62-containing protein aggregates, activated autophagy, and decreased a marker of apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). The association of Keap1 with p62 was augmented in MsrA-/- VSMC. Keap1 targets the transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates antioxidant genes, for proteasomal degradation. However, in MsrA-/- VSMC, the association of Nrf2 with Keap1 was diminished. Whereas Nrf2 mRNA levels were not decreased in MsrA-/- VSMC, we detected decreased ubiquitination of Nrf2 and a corresponding increase in total Nrf2 protein in the absence of biochemical markers of oxidative stress. Moreover, nuclear-localized Nrf2 was increased under MsrA deficiency, resulting in upregulation of Nrf2-dependent transcriptional activity. Consequently, transcription, protein levels and enzymatic activity of glutamate-cysteine ligase and glutathione reductase were greatly augmented in MsrA-/- VSMC.Our findings demonstrate that reversal of methionine oxidation is required for maintenance of cellular homeostasis in the absence of increased oxidative stress. These data provide the first link between autophagy and activation of Nrf2 in the setting of MsrA deletion.",

Autophagy has been shown to be critical for the regulation of oxidative stress-induced renal tubular injury; however, little is known about its role in kidney CaOx stone formation. In the present study, we found that the autophagy antagonist chloroquine could significantly attenuate oxalate-induced autophagy activation, oxidative injury and mitochondrial damage of renal tubular cells in vitro and in vivo, as well as hyperoxaluria-induced CaOx crystals depositions in rat kidney, whereas the autophagy agonist rapamycin exerted contrasting effects. In addition, oxalate-induced p38 phosphorylation was significantly attenuated by chloroquine pretreatment but was markedly enhanced by rapamycin pretreatment, whereas the protective effect of chloroquine on rat renal tubular cell oxidative injury was partly reversed by a p38 protein kinase activator anisomycin. Furthermore, the knockdown of Beclin1 represented similar effects to chloroquine on oxalate-induced cell oxidative injury and p38 phosphorylation in vitro. Taken together, our results revealed that autophagy inhibition could attenuate oxalate-induced oxidative injury of renal tubular cell and CaOx crystal depositions in the rat kidney via, at least in part, inhibiting the activation of p38 signaling pathway, thus representing a novel role of autophagy in the regulation of oxalate-induced renal oxidative injury and CaOx crystal depositions for the first time.",

The basic mechanisms of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production suggest they select inactive synapses for pruning: whether they do so is unknown. To begin to unravel whether mitochondrial ROS regulate pruning, we made the local consequences of neuromuscular junction (NMJ) pruning detectable as motor deficits by using disparate exogenous and endogenous models to induce synaptic inactivity en masse in developing Xenopus laevis tadpoles. We resolved whether: (1) synaptic inactivity increases mitochondrial ROS; and (2) chemically heterogeneous antioxidants rescue synaptic inactivity induced motor deficits. Regardless of whether it was achieved with muscle (\u03b1-bungarotoxin), nerve (\u03b1-latrotoxin) targeted neurotoxins or an endogenous pruning cue (SPARC), synaptic inactivity increased mitochondrial ROS in vivo. The manganese porphyrins MnTE-2-PyP5+ and/or MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+ blocked mitochondrial ROS to significantly reduce neurotoxin and endogenous pruning cue induced motor deficits. Selectively inducing mitochondrial ROS\u2014using mitochondria-targeted Paraquat (MitoPQ)\u2014recapitulated synaptic inactivity induced motor deficits; which were significantly reduced by blocking mitochondrial ROS with MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+.

Oxidative stress is a key player in this complex cascade of secondary injury mechanisms and prominently contributes to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. NADPH oxidase (NOX) is a family of enzymes whose unique function is to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). Human post-mortem and animal studies have identified elevated NOX2 and NOX4 levels in the injured brain, suggesting that these two NOXs are involved in the pathogenesis of TBI. In support of this, NOX2 and NOX4 deletion studies have collectively revealed that targeting NOX enzymes can reduce oxidative stress, attenuate neuroinflammation, promote neuronal survival, and improve functional outcomes following TBI. In addition, NOX inhibitor studies have confirmed these findings and demonstrated an extended critical window of efficacious TBI treatment.

     "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents the most common chronic liver disease in industrialized countries. NAFLD progresses through the inflammatory phase of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to fibrosis and cirrhosis, with some cases developing liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Liver biopsy remains the gold standard approach to a definitive diagnosis of NAFLD and the distinction between simple steatosis and NASH. The pathogenesis of NASH is still not clear. Several theories have been proposed ranging from the \u201cTwo Hit Theory\u201d to the \u201cMultiple Hit Theory\u201d. However, the general consensus is that the gut microbiota, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial damage play key roles in the pathogenesis of NASH. The interaction between the gut epithelia and some commensal bacteria induces the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The main goal of any therapy addressing NASH is to reverse or prevent progression to liver fibrosis/cirrhosis. This problem represents the first \u201cAchilles\u2019 heel\u201d of the new molecules being evaluated in most ongoing clinical trials. The second is the inability of these molecules to reach the mitochondria, the primary sites of energy production and ROS generation. Recently, a variety of non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment approaches for NASH have been evaluated including vitamin E, the thiazolidinediones, and novel molecules related to NASH pathogenesis (including obeticholic acid and elafibranor). Recently, a new isoform of human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) was isolated and obtained in a synthetic recombinant form designated rMnSOD. This protein has been shown to be a powerful antioxidant capable of mediating ROS dismutation, penetrating biological barriers via its uncleaved leader peptide, and reducing portal hypertension and fibrosis in rats affected by liver cirrhosis. Based on these distinctive characteristics, it can be hypothesized that this novel recombinant protein (rMnSOD) potentially represents a new and highly efficient adjuvant therapy to counteract the progression from NASH to HCC.",

     "abstract": "The human brain consumes 20% of the total basal oxygen (O2) budget to support ATP intensive neuronal activity. Without sufficient O2 to support ATP demands, neuronal activity fails, such that, even transient ischemia is neurodegenerative. While the essentiality of O2 to brain function is clear, how oxidative stress causes neurodegeneration is ambiguous. Ambiguity exists because many of the reasons why the brain is susceptible to oxidative stress remain obscure. Many are erroneously understood as the deleterious result of adventitious O2 derived free radical and non-radical species generation. To understand how many reasons underpin oxidative stress, one must first re-cast free radical and non-radical species in a positive light because their deliberate generation enables the brain to achieve critical functions (e.g. synaptic plasticity) through redox signalling (i.e. positive functionality). Using free radicals and non-radical derivatives to signal sensitises the brain to oxidative stress when redox signalling goes awry (i.e. negative functionality). To advance mechanistic understanding, we rationalise 13 reasons why the brain is susceptible to oxidative stress. Key reasons include inter alia unsaturated lipid enrichment, mitochondria, calcium, glutamate, modest antioxidant defence, redox active transition metals and neurotransmitter auto-oxidation. We review RNA oxidation as an underappreciated cause of oxidative stress. The complex interplay between each reason dictates neuronal susceptibility to oxidative stress in a dynamic context and neural identity dependent manner. Our discourse sets the stage for investigators to interrogate the biochemical basis of oxidative stress in the brain in health and disease.",

     "abstract": "Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is a well-recognized proatherogenic particle that functions in atherosclerosis. In this study, we established conditions to generate human oxLDL, characterized according to the grade of lipid and protein oxidation, particle size and oxylipin content. The induction effect of the cellular proatherogenic response was assessed in foam cells by using an oxLDL-macrophage interaction model. Uptake of oxLDL, reactive oxygen species production and expression of oxLDL receptors (CD36, SR-A and LOX-1) were significantly increased in THP-1 macrophages. Analyses of 35 oxylipins revealed that isoprostanes (IsoP) and prostaglandins (PGs) derived from the oxidation of arachidonic, dihomo gamma-linolenic and eicosapentaenoic acids were strongly and significantly induced in macrophages stimulated with oxLDL. Importantly, the main metabolites responsible for the THP1-macrophage response to oxLDL exposure were the oxidative stress markers 5-epi-5-F2t-IsoP, 15-E1t-IsoP, 8-F3t-IsoP and 15-keto-15-F2t-IsoP as well as inflammatory markers PGDM, 17-trans-PGF3\u03b1, and 11\u03b2-PGF2\u03b1, all of which are reported here, for the first time, to function in the interaction of oxLDL with THP-1 macrophages. By contrast, a salvage pathway mediated by anti-inflammatory PGs (PGE1 and 17-trans-PGF3\u03b1) was also identified, suggesting a response to oxLDL-induced injury. In conclusion, when THP-1 macrophages were treated with oxLDL, a specific induction of biomarkers related to oxidative stress and inflammation was triggered. This work contributes to our understanding of initial atherogenic events mediated by oxLDL-macrophage interactions and helps to generate new approaches for their modulation.",

     "abstract": "NADPH oxidases are important sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several Nox homologues are present together in the vascular system but whether they exhibit crosstalk at the activity level is unknown. To address this, vessel function of knockout mice for the cytosolic Nox organizer proteins p47phox, NoxO1 and a p47phox-NoxO1-double knockout were studied under normal condition and during streptozotocin-induced diabetes.In the mouse aorta, mRNA expression for NoxO1 was predominant in smooth muscle and endothelial cells, whereas p47phox was markedly expressed in adventitial cells comprising leukocytes and tissue resident macrophages. Knockout of either NoxO1 or p47phox resulted in lower basal blood pressure. Deletion of any of the two subunits also prevented diabetes-induced vascular dysfunction. mRNA expression analysis by MACE (Massive Analysis of cDNA ends) identified substantial gene expression differences between the mouse lines and in response to diabetes. Deletion of p47phox induced inflammatory activation with increased markers of myeloid cells and cytokine and chemokine induction. In contrast, deletion of NoxO1 resulted in an attenuated interferon gamma signature and reduced expression of genes related to antigen presentation. This aspect was also reflected by a reduced number of circulating lymphocytes in NoxO1-/- mice.ROS production stimulated by NoxO1 and p47phox limit endothelium-dependent relaxation and maintain blood pressure in mice. However, NoxO1 and p47phox cannot substitute each other despite their similar effect on vascular function. Deletion of NoxO1 induced an anti-inflammatory phenotype, whereas p47phox deletion rather elicited a hyper-inflammatory response.",

     "abstract": "Neointimal hyperplasia as a consequence of vascular injury is aggravated by inflammatory reaction and oxidative stress. The \u03b17 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (\u03b17nAChR) is a orchestrator of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP), which refers to a physiological neuro-immune mechanism that restricts inflammation. Here, we investigated the potential role of CAP in neointimal hyperplasia using \u03b17nAChR knockout (KO) mice. Male \u03b17nAChR-KO mice and their wild-type control mice (WT) were subjected to wire injury in left common carotid artery. At 4 weeks post injury, the injured aortae were isolated for examination. The neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury was significantly aggravated in \u03b17nAChR-KO mice compared with WT mice. The \u03b17nAChR-KO mice had increased collagen contents and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) amount. Moreover, the inflammation was significantly enhanced in the neointima of \u03b17nAChR-KO mice relative to WT mice, evidenced by the increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1/interleukin-1\u03b2, and macrophage infiltration. Meanwhile, the chemokines chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 and chemokine (CXC motif) ligand 2 expression was also augmented in the neointima of \u03b17nAChR-KO mice compared with WT mice. Additionally, the depletion of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH), and the upregulation of 3-nitrotyrosine, malondialdehyde and myeloperoxidase were more pronounced in neointima of \u03b17nAChR-KO mice compared with WT mice. Accordingly, the protein expression of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), Nox2 and Nox4, was also higher in neointima of \u03b17nAChR-KO mice compared with WT mice. Finally, pharmacologically activation of CAP with a selective \u03b17nAChR agonist PNU-282987, significantly reduced neointima formation, arterial inflammation and oxidative stress after vascular injury in C57BL/6 mice. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that \u03b17nAChR-mediated CAP is a neuro-physiological mechanism that inhibits neointima formation after vascular injury via suppressing arterial inflammation and oxidative stress. Further, these results imply that targeting \u03b17nAChR may be a promising interventional strategy for in-stent stenosis.",

     "abstract": "Primary and secondary hypertension is associated with kidney redox imbalance resulting in enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enzymes dependent phospholipid metabolism. The fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, URB597, modulates the levels of endocannabinoids, particularly of anandamide, which is responsible for controlling blood pressure and regulating redox balance. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effects of chronic URB597 administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and rats with secondary hypertension (DOCA-salt rats) on the kidney metabolism associated with the redox and endocannabinoid systems. It was shown fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor decreased the activity of ROS-generated enzymes what resulted in a reduction of ROS level. Moreover varied changes in antioxidant parameters were observed with tendency to improve antioxidant defense in SHR kidney. Moreover, URB597 administration to hypertensive rats decreased pro-inflammatory response, particularly in the kidneys of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. URB597 had tendency to enhance ROS-dependent phospholipid oxidation, estimated by changes in neuroprostanes in the kidney of SHR and reactive aldehydes (4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde) in DOCA-salt rats, in particular. The administration of FAAH inhibitor resulted in increased level of endocannabinoids in kidney of both groups of hypertensive rats led to enhanced expression of the cannabinoid receptors type 1 and 2 in SHR as well as vanilloid receptor 1 receptors in DOCA-salt rats. URB597 given to normotensive rats also affected kidney oxidative metabolism, resulting in enhanced level of neuroprostanes in Wistar Kyoto rats and reactive aldehydes in Wistar rats. Moreover, the level of endocannabinoids and cannabinoid receptors were significantly higher in both control groups of rats after URB597 administration.In conclusion, because URB597 disturbed the kidney redox system and phospholipid ROS-dependent and enzymatic-dependent metabolism, the administration of this inhibitor may enhance kidney disorders depending on model of hypertension, but may also cause kidney disturbances in control rats. Therefore, further studies are warranted.",

     "abstract": "Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is an inducible stress response protein and well known to protect cells and tissues against injury. Despite its important function in cytoprotection against physiological stress, the role of HO-1 in embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation remains largely unknown. We showed previously that induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that lack HO-1 are more sensitive to oxidant stress-induced cell death and more prone to lose pluripotent markers upon LIF withdrawal. To elucidate the role of HO-1 in ESC differentiation and to rule out the controversy of potential gene flaws in iPS cells, we derived and established mouse HO-1 knockout ESC lines from HO-1 knockout blastocysts. Using wild type D3 and HO-1 knockout ESCs in the 3-dimensional embryoid body (EB) differentiation model, we showed that at an early time point during EB development, an absence of HO-1 led to enhanced ROS level, concomitant with increased expressions of master mesodermal regulator brachyury and endodermal marker GATA6. In addition, critical smooth muscle cell (SMC) transcription factor serum response factor and its coactivator myocardin were enhanced. Furthermore, HO-1 deficiency increased Smad2 in ESCs and EBs, revealing a role of HO-1 in controlling Smad2 level. Smad2 not only mediates mesendoderm differentiation of mouse ESCs but also SMC development. Collectively, loss of HO-1 resulted in higher level of mesodermal and SMC regulators, leading to accelerated and enhanced SMC marker SM \u03b1-actin expression. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized function of HO-1 in regulating SMC gene expressions during ESC-EB development. More importantly, our findings may provide a novel strategy in enhancing ESC differentiation toward SMC lineage.",

The present study aimed to investigate the cardioprotective potential of caffeic acid o-nitro phenethyl ester (CAPE-oNO2) on MIRI and the possible mechanism based on the positive control of CAPE. The SD rats were subjected to left coronary artery ischemia /reperfusion (IR) and the H9c2 cell cultured in hypoxia/reoxygenation (HR) to induce the MIRI model. Prior to the procedure, vehicle, CAPE or CAPE-oNO2 were treated in the absence or presence of a SIRT1 inhibitor nicotinamide (NAM) and an eNOS inhibitor N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). In vivo, CAPE and CAPE-oNO2 conferred a cardioprotective effect as shown by reduced myocardial infarct size, cardiac marker enzymes and structural abnormalities. From immunohistochemical and sirius red staining, above two compounds ameliorated the TNF-\u03b1 release and collagen deposition of IR rat hearts. They could agitate SIRT1 and eNOS expression, and consequently enhance NO release and suppress NF-\u03baB signaling, to reduce the malondialdehyde content and cell necrosis. In vitro, they could inhibit HR-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis and ROS generation by activating SIRT1/eNOS pathway and inhabiting NF-\u03baB expression. Emphatically, CAPE-oNO2 presented the stronger cardioprotection than CAPE both in vivo and in vitro.

     "abstract": "Reactive sulfur species (RSS) such as H2S, HS\u2022, H2Sn, (n = 2\u20137) and HS2\u2022- are chemically similar to H2O and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) HO\u2022, H2O2, O2\u2022- and act on common biological effectors. RSS were present in evolution long before ROS, and because both are metabolized by catalase it has been suggested that \u201cantioxidant\u201d enzymes originally evolved to regulate RSS and may continue to do so today. Here we examined RSS metabolism by Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) using amperometric electrodes for dissolved H2S, a polysulfide-specific fluorescent probe (SSP4), and mass spectrometry to identify specific polysulfides (H2S2-H2S5). H2S was concentration- and oxygen-dependently oxidized by 1\u00a0\u03bcM SOD to polysulfides (mainly H2S2, and to a lesser extent H2S3 and H2S5) with an EC50 of approximately 380\u00a0\u03bcM H2S. H2S concentrations > 750\u00a0\u03bcM inhibited SOD oxidation (IC50 = 1.25\u00a0mM) with complete inhibition when H2S > 1.75\u00a0mM. Polysulfides were not metabolized by SOD. SOD oxidation preferred dissolved H2S over hydrosulfide anion (HS-), whereas HS- inhibited polysulfide production. In hypoxia, other possible electron donors such as nitrate, nitrite, sulfite, sulfate, thiosulfate and metabisulfite were ineffective. Manganese SOD also catalyzed H2S oxidation to form polysulfides, but did not metabolize polysulfides indicating common attributes of these SODs. These experiments suggest that, unlike the well-known SOD-mediated dismutation of two O2\u2022- to form H2O2 and O2, SOD catalyzes a reaction using H2S and O2 to form persulfide. These can then combine in various ways to form polysulfides and sulfur oxides. It is also possible that H2S (or polysulfides) interact/react with SOD cysteines to affect catalytic activity or to directly contribute to sulfide metabolism. Our studies suggest that H2S metabolism by SOD may have been an ancient mechanism to detoxify sulfide or to regulate RSS and along with catalase may continue to do so in contemporary organisms.",

Lipotoxicity refers to cellular injury caused by hepatic free fatty acids (FFAs) and cholesterol accumulation. Excess cholesterol autoxidizes to oxysterols during oxidative stress conditions. We hypothesize that interaction of FAs and cholesterol derivatives may primarily impair mitochondrial function and affect biogenesis adaptation during NAFLD progression. We demonstrated that the accumulation of specific non-enzymatic oxysterols in the liver of animals fed high-fat+high-cholesterol diet induces mitochondrial damage and depletion of proteins of the respiratory chain complexes. When tested in vitro, 5\u03b1-cholestane-3\u03b2,5,6\u03b2-triol (triol) combined to FFAs was able to reduce respiration in isolated liver mitochondria, induced apoptosis in primary hepatocytes, and down-regulated transcription factors involved in mitochondrial biogenesis. Finally, a lower protein content in the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes was observed in human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. In conclusion, hepatic accumulation of FFAs and non-enzymatic oxysterols synergistically facilitates development and progression of NAFLD by impairing mitochondrial function, energy balance and biogenesis adaptation to chronic injury.",

The rate of B-cell lymphomas in HIV-infected individuals remains high even under the combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) that reconstitutes the immune function. Thus, the contribution of HIV-1 to B-cell oncogenesis remains enigmatic. HIV-1 induces oxidative stress and DNA damage in infected cells via multiple mechanisms, including viral Tat protein. We have detected elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage in B-cells of HIV-infected individuals. As Tat is present in blood of infected individuals and is able to transduce cells, we hypothesized that it could induce oxidative DNA damage in B-cells promoting genetic instability and malignant transformation. Indeed, incubation of B-cells isolated from healthy donors with purified Tat protein led to oxidative stress, a decrease in the glutathione (GSH) levels, DNA damage and appearance of chromosomal aberrations. The effects of Tat relied on its transcriptional activity and were mediated by NF-\u03baB activation. Tat stimulated oxidative stress in B-cells mostly via mitochondrial ROS production which depended on the reverse electron flow in Complex I of respiratory chain. We propose that Tat-induced oxidative stress, DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations are novel oncogenic factors favoring B-cell lymphomas in HIV-1 infected individuals.",

Trehalose, a naturally occurring nontoxic disaccharide found in plants, insects, microorganisms and invertebrates, but not in mammals, was reported to function as a mechanistic target of the rapamycin (mTOR)-independent inducer of autophagy. In addition, trehalose functions as an antioxidant though its underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we showed that trehalose not only promoted autophagy, but also increased p62 protein expression, in an autophagy-independent manner. In addition, trehalose increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) in a p62-dependent manner and enhance expression of its downstream antioxidant factors, heme oxygenase-1 (Ho-1) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate quinone dehydrogenase 1 (Nqo1). Moreover, treatment with trehalose significantly reduced amount of reactive oxygen species. Collectively, these results suggested that trehalose can function as a novel activator of the p62\u2013Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, in addition to inducing autophagy. Therefore, trehalose may be useful to treat many chronic diseases involving oxidative stress and dysfunction of autophagy.",

However, the downstream effectors of ROS signaling that control stem cell behavior remain largely unexplored. Here, we used the Drosophila testis as an in vivo model to identify ROS-induced effectors that are involved in the differentiation process of germline stem cells (GSCs). In the Affymetrix microarray analysis, 152 genes were either upregulated or downregulated during GSC differentiation induced by elevated levels of ROS, and a follow-up validation of the gene expression by qRT-PCR showed a Spearman's rho of 0.9173 (P<0.0001). Notably, 47 (31%) of the identified genes had no predicted molecular function or recognizable protein domain. These suggest the robustness of this microarray analysis, which identified many uncharacterized genes, possibly with an essential role in ROS-induced GSC differentiation. We also showed that maf-S is transcriptionally downregulated by oxidative stress, and that maf-S knockdown promotes GSC differentiation but Maf-S overexpression conversely results in an over-growth of GSC-like cells by promoting the mitotic activity of germ cell lineage. Together with the facts that Maf-S regulates ROS levels and genetically interacts with Keap1/Nrf2 in GSC maintenance, our study suggests that Maf-S plays an important role in the Drosophila testis GSC maintenance by participating in the regulation of redox homeostasis.",

The objective of this study was to obtain evidence on whether TSAT determines the impact of experimental ischemic stroke on brain damage and whether iron-free transferrin (apotransferrin, ATf)-induced reduction of TSAT is neuroprotective. We found that experimental ischemic stroke promoted an early extravasation of circulating iron-loaded transferrin (holotransferrin, HTf) to the ischemic brain parenchyma. In vitro, HTf was found to boost ROS production and to be harmful to primary neuronal cultures exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation. In stroked rats, whereas increasing TSAT with exogenous HTf was detrimental, administration of exogenous ATf and the subsequent reduction of TSAT was neuroprotective. Mechanistically, ATf did not prevent extravasation of HTf to the brain parenchyma in rats exposed to ischemic stroke. However, ATf in vitro reduced NMDA-induced neuronal uptake of HTf and also both the NMDA-mediated lipid peroxidation derived 4-HNE and the resulting neuronal death without altering Ca2+-calcineurin signaling downstream the NMDA receptor. Removal of transferrin from the culture media or blockade of transferrin receptors reduced neuronal death. Together, our data establish that blood TSAT exerts a critical role in experimental stroke-induced brain damage. In addition, our findings suggest that the protective effect of ATf at the neuronal level resides in preventing NMDA-induced HTf uptake and ROS production, which in turn reduces neuronal damage.",

The therapeutic value of chronic NDHP treatment was assessed in an experimental model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension in combination with NOS inhibition.NDHP mediates NO formation in both cell-free system and small resistance arteries, a process which is catalyzed by xanthine oxidoreductase. NDHP-induced vasorelaxation is endothelium independent and mediated by NO release and modulation of potassium channels. Reduction of blood pressure following acute intravenous infusion of NDHP was more pronounced in hypertensive rats (two-kidney-one-clip model) than in normotensive sham-operated rats. Toxicological tests did not reveal any harmful effects following treatment with high doses of NDHP. Finally, chronic treatment with NDHP significantly attenuated the development of hypertension and endothelial dysfunction in rats with chronic NOS inhibition and angiotensin II infusion.Acute treatment with the novel organic nitrate NDHP increases NO formation, which is associated with vasorelaxation and a significant reduction of blood pressure in hypertensive animals. Chronic NDHP treatment attenuates the progression of hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, suggesting a potential for therapeutic applications in cardiovascular disease.",

We demonstrate that 4F and Cl/NO2-HDL act on scavenger receptor type I (SR-B1) using human aorta endothelial cells (HAEC) and SR-B1 (-/-) mouse aortic endothelial cells. Wound healing, transwell migration, lamellipodia formation and single cell migration assay experiments show that 4F treatment is associated with a recovery of endothelial cell migration and associated with significantly increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, Akt phosphorylation and SR-B1 expression. 4F increases NO generation and diminishes oxidative stress. In vivo, 4F can stimulate cell proliferation and re-endothelialization in the carotid artery after treatment with Cl/NO2-HDL in a carotid artery electric injury model but fails to do so in SR-B1(-/-) mice. These findings demonstrate that 4F promotes endothelial cell migration and has a potential therapeutic benefit against early endothelial injury in cardiovascular diseases.",

     "abstract": "Therapeutic strategies that increase hydrogen sulfide (H2S) or nitric oxide (NO) are cytoprotective in various models of cardiovascular injury. However, the nature of interaction between H2S and NO in heart failure and the underlying mechanisms for the protective effects remain undefined. The present study tested the cardioprotective effect of ZYZ-803, a novel synthetic H2S-NO hybrid molecule that decomposed to release H2S and NO. ZYZ-803 dose dependently improved left ventricular remodeling and preserved left ventricular function in the setting of isoprenaline-induced heart failure. The cardioprotective effect of ZYZ-803 is significantly more potent than that of H2S and/or NO donor alone. ZYZ-803 stimulated the expression of cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE) for H2S generation and the activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) for NO production. Blocking CSE and/or eNOS suppressed ZYZ-803-induced H2S and NO production and cardioprotection. ZYZ-803 increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration and cyclic guanosine 5\u2032-monophosphate (cGMP) level. Moreover, ZYZ-803 upregulated the endogenous antioxidants, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). These findings indicate that H2S and NO cooperatively attenuates left ventricular remodeling and dysfunction during the development of heart failure through VEGF/cGMP pathway and ZYZ-803 provide expanding insight into strategies for treatment of heart failure.",

Our previous studies showed that cancer cells can develop P-gp overexpression-mediated intrinsic drug resistance in the formation of 3D MCF-7 multi-cellular layers (MCLs) without any drug induction. However, whether metabolic reprogramming and redox imbalance functioned during this progress remained unrevealed. In our present study, LC-Q/TOF-MS and GC-MS were used in combination for analysing intracellular metabolites. The contribution of pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and its related redox status were checked by chemical interfering and silencing/over-expression of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD). The downstream products of G6PD were assayed by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot and flow cytometry. Results showed that not only G6PD expression but also G6PD activity was significantly lowered along with 3D MCF-7 cells culture time. Impaired PPP disturbed redox-cycling, generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which triggered cell cycle arrest and caused the switch to Chk2/p53/NF-\u03baB pathway-mediated P-gp induction. Our results provided a new attempt to associate intrinsic small molecule metabolites (impaired PPP) communicating with cell signalling pathways through disturbed intracellular redox status to elucidate multi-cellular resistance (MCR) in 3D MCF-7 cells, which improved the understanding of the mechanisms of P-gp up-regulation in MCR with metabolomic and related redox status support.",

     "abstract": "Titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) are widely used in food and cosmetics but the health impact of human exposure remains poorly defined. Emerging evidence suggests that TiO2 NPs may elicit immune responses by acting on macrophages. Our proteomic study showed that treatment of macrophages with TiO2 NPs led to significant re-organization of cell membrane and activation of inflammation. These observations were further corroborated with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments, which demonstrated that TiO2 NPs were trapped inside of multi-vesicular bodies (MVB) through endocytotic pathways. TiO2 NP caused significant mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing levels of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreasing ATP generation, and decreasing metabolic flux in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle from 13C-labelled glutamine using GC-MS-based metabolic flux analysis. Further lipidomic analysis showed that TiO2 NPs significantly decreased levels of cardiolipins, an important class of mitochondrial phospholipids for maintaining proper function of electron transport chains. Furthermore, TiO2 NP exposure activates inflammatory responses by increasing mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1, iNOS, and COX-2. Consistently, our targeted metabolomic analysis showed significantly increased production of COX-2 metabolites including PGD2, PGE2, and 15d-PGJ2. In addition, TiO2 NP also caused significant attenuation of phagocytotic function of macrophages. In summary, our studies utilizing multiple powerful omic techniques suggest that human exposure of TiO2 NPs may have profound impact on macrophage function through activating inflammatory responses and causing mitochondrial dysfunction without physical presence in mitochondria.",

     "abstract": "Nitrite represents an endocrine reserve of bioavailable nitric oxide (NO) that mediates a number of physiological responses including conferral of cytoprotection after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). It has long been known that nitrite can react with non-heme iron to form dinitrosyliron complexes (DNIC). However, it remains unclear how quickly nitrite-dependent DNIC form in vivo, whether formation kinetics differ from that of NO-dependent DNIC, and whether DNIC play a role in the cytoprotective effects of nitrite. Here we demonstrate that chronic but not acute nitrite supplementation increases DNIC concentration in the liver and kidney of mice. Although DNIC have been purported to have antioxidant properties, we show that the accumulation of DNIC in vivo is not associated with nitrite-dependent cytoprotection after hepatic I/R. Further, our data in an isolated mitochondrial model of anoxia/reoxygenation show that while NO and nitrite demonstrate similar S-nitrosothiol formation kinetics, DNIC formation is significantly greater with NO and associated with mitochondrial dysfunction as well as inhibition of aconitase activity. These data are the first to directly compare mitochondrial DNIC formation by NO and nitrite. This study suggests that nitrite-dependent DNIC formation is a physiological consequence of dietary nitrite. The data presented herein implicate mitochondrial DNIC formation as a potential mechanism underlying the differential cytoprotective effects of nitrite and NO after I/R, and suggest that DNIC formation is potentially responsible for the cytotoxic effects observed at high NO concentrations.",

     "abstract": "Clinical application of doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline antibiotic with potent anti- tumor effects, is limited because of its cardiotoxicity. However, its pathogenesis is still not entirely understood. The aim of this paper was to explore the mechanisms and new drug targets to treat DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. The in vitro model on H9C2 cells and the in vivo models on rats and mice were developed. The results showed that DOX markedly decreased H9C2 cell viability, increased the levels of CK, LDH, caused histopathological and ECG changes in rats and mice, and triggered myocardial oxidative damage via adjusting the levels of intracellular ROS, MDA, SOD, GSH and GSH-Px. Total of 18 differentially expressed microRNAs in rat heart tissue caused by DOX were screened out using microRNA microarray assay, especially showing that miR-140-5p was significantly increased by DOX which was selected as the target miRNA. Double-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-140-5p directly targeted Nrf2 and Sirt2, as a result of affecting the expression levels of HO-1, NQO1, Gst, GCLM, Keap1 and FOXO3a, and thereby increasing DOX-caused myocardial oxidative damage. In addition, the levels of intracellular ROS were significantly increased or decreased in H9C2 cells treated with DOX after miR-140-5p mimic or miR-140-5p inhibitor transfection, respectively, as well as the changed expression levels of Nrf2 and Sirt2. Furthermore, DOX- induced myocardial oxidative damage was worsened in mice treated with miR-140-5p agomir, and however the injury was alleviated in the mice administrated with miR-140-5p antagomir. Therefore, miR-140-5p plays an important role in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by promoting myocardial oxidative stress via targeting Nrf2 and Sirt2. Our data provide novel insights for investigating DOX-induced heart injury. In addition, miR-140-5p/ Nrf2 and miR-140-5p/Sirt2 may be the new targets to treat DOX-induced cardiotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "The system (PTTRS) formed by typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prx), thioredoxin (Trx), Trx reductase (TrxR), and sulfiredoxin (Srx) is central in antioxidant protection and redox signaling in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. Understanding how the PTTRS integrates these functions requires tracing phenotypes to molecular properties, which is non-trivial. Here we analyze this problem based on a model that captures the PTTRS\u2019 conserved features. We have mapped the conditions that generate each distinct response to H2O2 supply rates (vsup), and estimated the parameters for thirteen human cell types and for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The resulting composition-to-phenotype map yielded the following experimentally testable predictions. The PTTRS permits many distinct responses including ultra-sensitivity and hysteresis. However, nearly all tumor cell lines showed a similar response characterized by limited Trx-S- depletion and a substantial but self-limited gradual accumulation of hyperoxidized Prx at high vsup. This similarity ensues from strong correlations between the TrxR, Srx and Prx activities over cell lines, which contribute to maintain the Prx-SS reduction capacity in slight excess over the maximal steady state Prx-SS production. In turn, in erythrocytes, hepatocytes and HepG2 cells high vsup depletes Trx-S- and oxidizes Prx mainly to Prx-SS. In all nucleated human cells the Prx-SS reduction capacity defined a threshold separating two different regimes. At sub-threshold vsup the cytoplasmic H2O2 concentration is determined by Prx, nM-range and spatially localized, whereas at supra-threshold vsup it is determined by much less active alternative sinks and \u03bcM-range throughout the cytoplasm. The yeast shows a distinct response where the Prx Tsa1 accumulates in sulfenate form at high vsup. This is mainly due to an exceptional stability of Tsa1's sulfenate. The implications of these findings for thiol redox regulation and cell physiology are discussed. All estimates were thoroughly documented and provided, together with analytical approximations for system properties, as a resource for quantitative redox biology.",

     "abstract": "Hallmarks of cancer cells include uncontrolled growth and rapid proliferation; thus, cyclin-dependent kinases are a therapeutic target for cancer treatment. Treating non-small lung cancer cells with sublethal concentrations of the CDK4/6 inhibitors, ribociclib (LEE011) and palbociclib (PD0332991), which are approved by the FDA for anticancer therapies, caused cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase and suppression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) transcription by inducing recruitment of the RB1-E2F1-HDAC1-EZH2 repressive complex to the PARP1 promoter. Downregulation of PARP1 made cancer cells vulnerable to death triggered by the anticancer drugs (WP631 and etoposide) and H2O2. All agents brought about redox imbalance and DNA strand breaks. The lack of PARP1 and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation impaired the 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1)-dependent base excision DNA repair pathway, which is critical for maintaining the viability of cells treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors during oxidative stress. Upon G1 arrest of PARP1 overexpressing cells, OGG1 formed an immunoprecipitable complex with PARP1. Similar to cells with downregulated PARP1 expression, inhibition of PARP1 or OGG1 in PARP1 overexpressing cells resulted in DNA damage and decreased viability. Thus, PARP1 and OGG1 act in the same regulatory pathway, and PARP1 activity is required for OGG1-mediated repair of oxidative DNA damage in G1-arrested cells. In conclusion, the action of CDK4/6 inhibitors is not limited to the inhibition of cell growth. CDK4/6 inhibitors also lead to accumulation of DNA damage by repressing PARP1 in oxidatively stressed cells. Thus, CDK4/6 inhibitors sensitize G1-arrested cells to anticancer drugs, since these cells require PARP1-OGG1 functional interaction for cell survival.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to (bi)sulfite (HSO3\u2013) and sulfite (SO32\u2013) has been shown to induce a wide range of adverse reactions in sensitive individuals. Studies have shown that peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of (bi)sulfite leads to formation of several reactive free radicals, such as sulfur trioxide anion (.SO3\u2013), peroxymonosulfate (\u2013O3SOO.), and especially the sulfate (SO4. \u2013) anion radicals. One such peroxidase in neutrophils is myeloperoxidase (MPO), which has been shown to form protein radicals. Although formation of (bi)sulfite-derived protein radicals is documented in isolated neutrophils, its involvement and role in in vivo inflammatory processes, has not been demonstrated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate (bi)sulfite-derived protein radical formation and its mechanism in LPS aerosol-challenged mice, a model of non-atopic asthma. Using immuno-spin trapping to detect protein radical formation, we show that, in the presence of (bi)sulfite, neutrophils present in bronchoalveolar lavage and in the lung parenchyma exhibit, MPO-catalyzed oxidation of MPO to a protein radical. The absence of radical formation in LPS-challenged MPO- or NADPH oxidase-knockout mice indicates that sulfite-derived radical formation is dependent on both MPO and NADPH oxidase activity. In addition to its oxidation by the MPO-catalyzed pathway, (bi)sulfite is efficiently detoxified to sulfate by the sulfite oxidase (SOX) pathway, which forms sulfate in a two-electron oxidation reaction. Since SOX activity in rodents is much higher than in humans, to better model sulfite toxicity in humans, we induced SOX deficiency in mice by feeding them a low molybdenum diet with tungstate. We found that mice treated with the SOX deficiency diet prior to exposure to (bi)sulfite had much higher protein radical formation than mice with normal SOX activity. Altogether, these results demonstrate the role of MPO and NADPH oxidase in (bi)sulfite-derived protein radical formation and show the involvement of protein radicals in a mouse model of human lung disease.",

     "abstract": "Impaired cardiac microvascular function contributes to diabetic cardiovascular complications although effective therapy remains elusive. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor recently approved for treatment of type 2 diabetes, promotes glycosuria excretion and offers cardioprotective actions beyond its glucose-lowering effects. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on cardiac microvascular injury in diabetes and the underlying mechanism involved with a focus on mitochondria. Our data revealed that empagliflozin improved diabetic myocardial structure and function, preserved cardiac microvascular barrier function and integrity, sustained eNOS phosphorylation and endothelium-dependent relaxation, as well as improved microvessel density and perfusion. Further study suggested that empagliflozin exerted its effects through inhibition of mitochondrial fission in an adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. Empagliflozin restored AMP-to-ATP ratio to trigger AMPK activation, suppressed Drp1S616 phosphorylation, and increased Drp1S637 phosphorylation, ultimately leading to inhibition of mitochondrial fission. The empagliflozin-induced inhibition of mitochondrial fission preserved cardiac microvascular endothelial cell (CMEC) barrier function through suppressed mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production and subsequently oxidative stress to impede CMEC senescence. Empagliflozin-induced fission loss also favored angiogenesis by promoting CMEC migration through amelioration of F-actin depolymerization.

In contrast, many protists, including important apicomplexan and kinetoplastid parasites, lack Mia40. Furthermore, the Erv homolog of the model parasite Leishmania tarentolae (LtErv) was shown to be incompatible with Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mia40 (ScMia40). Here we addressed structure-function relationships of ScErv1 and LtErv as well as their compatibility with the oxidative protein folding system in yeast using chimeric, truncated, and mutant Erv constructs. Chimeras between the N-terminal arm of ScErv1 and a variety of truncated LtErv constructs were able to rescue yeast cells that lack ScErv1. Yeast cells were also viable when only a single cysteine residue was replaced in LtErvC17S. Thus, the presence and position of the C-terminal arm and the kinetoplastida-specific second (KISS) domain of LtErv did not interfere with its functionality in the yeast system, whereas a relatively conserved cysteine residue before the flavodomain rendered LtErv incompatible with ScMia40. The question whether parasite Erv homologs might also exert the function of Mia40 was addressed in another set of complementation assays. However, neither the KISS domain nor other truncated or mutant LtErv constructs were able to rescue yeast cells that lack ScMia40. The general relevance of Erv and its candidate substrate small Tim1 was analyzed for the related parasite L. infantum. Repeated unsuccessful knockout attempts suggest that both genes are essential in this human pathogen and underline the potential of mitochondrial protein import pathways for future intervention strategies.",

     "abstract": "The paradoxical role of reactive oxygen species in cell death versus cell survival establishes a delicate balance between chemotherapy efficacy and management of detrimental side effects. Normal proliferative signaling requires that cells remain inside a redox range that allows reversible protein oxidation to occur. Shifting the redox environment toward highly reducing or oxidizing states leads to cellular stress and cell death. Reactive oxygen species produced in response to Taxol and cisplatin treatment are necessary for effective cancer cell killing but the same ROS leads to damaging side effects in normal tissues. Combining antioxidants with chemotherapeutics to alleviate the unwanted side effects produces variable and often undesirable effects on cancer treatment. Here, we describe a more targeted method to improve ovarian cancer cell killing without the need for antioxidants. In ovarian cancer cells, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a prominent growth factor that contributes to tumor survival and proliferation. We find that blocking LPA-dependent signaling with a specific receptor antagonist consistently increases cell death in response to both Taxol and cisplatin. We propose that inhibiting the upregulated growth factor-dependent signaling in cancer cells will target chemo-insensitivity, potentially lowering the necessary dose of the drugs and preventing harmful side effects.",

     "abstract": "Aged tissues usually show a decreased regenerative capacity accompanied by a decline in functionality. During aging pancreatic islets also undergo several morphological and metabolic changes. Besides proliferative and regenerative limitations, endocrine cells lose their secretory capacity, contributing to a decline in functional islet mass and a deregulated glucose homeostasis. This is linked to several features of aging, such as induction of cellular senescence or the formation of modified proteins, such as advanced glycation end products (AGEs) - the latter mainly examined in relation to hyperglycemia and in disease models. However, age-related changes of endocrine islets under normoglycemic and non-pathologic conditions are poorly investigated. Therefore, a characterization of pancreatic tissue sections as wells as plasma samples of wild-type mice (C57BL/6J) at various age groups (2.5, 5, 10, 15, 21 months) was performed. Our findings reveal that mice at older age are able to secret sufficient amounts of insulin to maintain normoglycemia. During aging the pancreatic islet area increased and the islet size doubled in 21 months old mice when compared to 2.5 months old mice, whereas the islet number was unchanged. This was accompanied by an age-dependent decrease in Ki-67 levels and pancreatic duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX-1), indicating a decline in proliferative and regenerative capacity of pancreatic islets with advancing age. In contrast, the number of p16Ink4a-positive nuclei within the islets was elevated starting from 10 months of age. Interestingly, AGEs accumulated exclusively in the islet blood vessels of old mice associated with increased amounts of inflammatory markers, such as the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). In summary, the age-related increase in islet size and area was associated with the induction of senescence, accompanied by an accumulation of non-enzymatically modified proteins in the islet vascular system.",

     "abstract": "The extracellular pH (pHe) is a key determinant of the cellular (micro)environment and needs to be maintained within strict boundaries to allow normal cell function. Here we used HEK293 cells to study the effects of pHe acidification (24\u00a0h), induced by mitochondrial inhibitors (rotenone, antimycin A) and/or extracellular HCl addition. Lowering pHe from 7.2 to 5.8 reduced cell viability by 70% and was paralleled by a decrease in cytosolic pH (pHc), hyperpolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03c8), increased levels of hydroethidine-oxidizing ROS and stimulation of protein carbonylation. Co-treatment with the antioxidant \u03b1-tocopherol, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) desensitizer cyclosporin A and Necrostatin-1, a combined inhibitor of Receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 1 (RIPK1) and Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), prevented acidification-induced cell death. In contrast, the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk and the ferroptosis inhibitor Ferrostatin-1 were ineffective. We conclude that extracellular acidification induces necroptotic cell death in HEK293 cells and that the latter involves intracellular acidification, mitochondrial functional impairment, increased ROS levels, mPTP opening and protein carbonylation. These findings suggest that acidosis of the extracellular environment (as observed in mitochondrial disorders, ischemia, acute inflammation and cancer) can induce cell death via a ROS- and mPTP opening-mediated pathogenic mechanism.",

Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays a critical role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Therefore, whether SFN prevents Ang II-induced cardiomyopathy through activation of Nrf2 was examined using wild-type, global deletion of Nrf2 gene (Nrf2-KO) and cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of Nrf2 gene (Nrf2-TG) mice.Administration of a subpressor dose of Ang II to wild-type mice induced cardiac oxidative stress, inflammation, remodeling and dysfunction, all of which could be prevented by SFN treatment with Nrf2 up-regulation and activation. Nrf2-KO mice are susceptible, and Nrf2-TG mice are resistant, respectively, to Ang II-induced cardiomyopathy. Meanwhile, the ability of SFN to protect against Ang II-induced cardiac damage was lost in Nrf2-KO mice. Up-regulation and activation of Nrf2 by SFN is accompanied by activation of Akt, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2, and accumulation of Fyn in nuclei. In vitro up-regulation of Nrf2 by SFN was abolished and nuclear Fyn accumulation was increased when cardiac cells were exposed to a PI3K inhibitor or GSK-3\u03b2-specific activator.These results suggest that Nrf2 plays a central role in the prevention of Ang II-induced cardiomyopathy, and SFN prevents Ang II-induced cardiomyopathy partially via the Akt/GSK-3\u03b2/Fyn-mediated Nrf2 activation.",

     "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) constitute the defensive barrier of vasculature, which maintains the vascular homeostasis. Mitochondrial oxidative stress (mitoOS) in ECs significantly affects the initiation and progression of vascular diseases. The higher serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level is being recognized as a nonconventional risk factor responsible for the increased risk of cardiovascular diseases in subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH). However, effects and underlying mechanisms of elevated TSH on ECs are still ambiguous. We sought to investigate whether cyclophilin D (CypD), emerging as a crucial mediator in mitoOS, regulates effects of TSH on ECs.SCH patients with TSH > = 10\u00a0mIU/L showed a positive correlation between serum TSH and endothelin-1 levels. When TSH levels declined to normal in these subjects after levothyroxine therapy, serum endothelin-1 levels were significantly reduced. Supplemented with exogenous thyroxine to keep normal thyroid hormones, thyroid-specific TSH receptor (TSHR)-knockout mice with injection of exogenous TSH exhibited elevated serum TSH levels, significant endothelial oxidative injuries and disturbed endothelium-dependent vasodilation. However, Tshr-/- mice resisted to TSH-impaired vasotonia. We further confirmed that elevated TSH triggered excessive mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening and mitochondrial oxidative damages in mouse aorta, as well as in cultured ECs. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of CypD (the key regulator for mPTP opening) attenuated TSH-induced mitochondrial oxidative damages and further rescued endothelial functions. Finally, we confirmed that elevated TSH could activate CypD by enhancing CypD acetylation via inhibiting adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase/sirtuin-3 signaling pathway in ECs.These findings reveal that elevated TSH triggers mitochondrial perturbations in ECs and provide insights that blocking mitochondrial CypD enhances the defensive ability of ECs under TSH exposure.",

However, malfunction of mitochondria results in generation of superoxide anion radical (O2\u2022-), which due to the relatively low chemical reactivity is rather unlikely to cause harmful effects triggered by nanoparticles. We show that treatment of HepG2 cells with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) resulted in generation of H2O2 instead of O2\u2022-, as measured by ROS specific mitochondrial probes. Moreover, addition of a selective iron chelator diminished AgNPs toxicity. Altogether these results suggest that O2\u2022- generated during NPs induced mitochondrial collapse is rapidly dismutated to H2O2, which in the presence of iron ions undergoes a Fenton reaction to produce an extremely reactive hydroxyl radical (\u2022OH). Clarification of the mechanism of NPs-dependent generation of \u2022OH and demonstration of the crucial role of iron ions in NPs toxicity will facilitate our understanding of NPs toxicity and the design of safe nanomaterials.",

These include hypochlorous acid (HOCl) that is formed via the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-chloride system of activated phagocytes. HOCl targets the endogenous pool of ether phospholipids (plasmalogens) generating chlorinated inflammatory mediators like e.g. 2-chlorohexadecanal and its conversion product 2-chlorohexadecanoic acid (2-ClHA). In the cerebrovasculature these compounds inflict damage to brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) that form the morphological basis of the BBB. To follow subcellular trafficking of 2-ClHA we synthesized a \u2018clickable\u2019 alkyne derivative (2-ClHyA) that phenocopied the biological activity of the parent compound. Confocal and superresolution structured illumination microscopy revealed accumulation of 2-ClHyA in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria of human BMVEC (hCMEC/D3 cell line). 2-ClHA and its alkyne analogue interfered with protein palmitoylation, induced ER-stress markers, reduced the ER ATP content, and activated transcription and secretion of interleukin (IL)\u22126 as well as IL-8. 2-ClHA disrupted the mitochondrial membrane potential and induced procaspase-3 and PARP cleavage. The protein kinase R-like ER kinase (PERK) inhibitor GSK2606414 suppressed 2-ClHA-mediated activating transcription factor 4 synthesis and IL-6/8 secretion, but showed no effect on endothelial barrier dysfunction and cleavage of procaspase-3.

     "abstract": "Bacterial dormancy is a major impediment to the eradication of tuberculosis (TB), because currently used drugs primarily target actively replicating bacteria. Therefore, decoding of the critical survival pathways in dormant tubercle bacilli is a research priority to formulate new approaches for killing these bacteria. Employing a network-based gene expression analysis approach, we demonstrate that redox active vitamin C (vit C) triggers a multifaceted and robust adaptation response in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) involving ~ 67% of the genome. Vit C-adapted bacteria display well-described features of dormancy, including growth stasis and progression to a viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state, loss of acid-fastness and reduction in length, dissipation of reductive stress through triglyceride (TAG) accumulation, protective response to oxidative stress, and tolerance to first line TB drugs. VBNC bacteria are reactivatable upon removal of vit C and they recover drug susceptibility properties. Vit C synergizes with pyrazinamide, a unique TB drug with sterilizing activity, to kill dormant and replicating bacteria, negating any tolerance to rifampicin and isoniazid in combination treatment in both in-vitro and intracellular infection models. Finally, the vit C multi-stress redox models described here also offer a unique opportunity for concurrent screening of compounds/combinations active against heterogeneous subpopulations of Mtb. These findings suggest a novel strategy of vit C adjunctive therapy by modulating bacterial physiology for enhanced efficacy of combination chemotherapy with existing drugs, and also possible synergies to guide new therapeutic combinations towards accelerating TB treatment.",

However, bioavailable levels of H2S in its various biochemical metabolite forms during clinical cardiovascular disease remain poorly understood. We performed a case-controlled study to quantify and compare the bioavailability of various biochemical forms of H2S in patients with and without cardiovascular disease (CVD). In our study, we used the reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography monobromobimane assay to analytically measure bioavailable pools of H2S. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also identified using DNA Pyrosequencing. We found that plasma acid labile sulfide levels were significantly reduced in Caucasian females with CVD compared with those without the disease. Conversely, plasma bound sulfane sulfur levels were significantly reduced in Caucasian males with CVD compared with those without the disease. Surprisingly, gender differences of H2S bioavailability were not observed in African Americans, although H2S bioavailability was significantly lower overall in this ethnic group compared to Caucasians. We also performed SNP analysis of H2S synthesizing enzymes and found a significant increase in cystathionine gamma-lyase (CTH) 1364\u202fG-T allele frequency in patients with CVD compared to controls. Lastly, plasma H2S bioavailability was found to be predictive for cardiovascular disease in Caucasian subjects as determined by receiver operator characteristic analysis. These findings reveal that plasma H2S bioavailability could be considered a biomarker for CVD in an ethnic and gender manner. Cystathionine gamma-lyase 1346\u202fG-T SNP might also contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease development.",

Our results showed that polysulfide donor Na2S4 ameliorated cisplatin-caused renal toxicity in vitro and in vivo through suppressing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and downstream mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) activation. Additionally, polysulfide may inhibit ROS production by simultaneously lessening the activation of NADPH oxidase and inducing nucleus translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) in RPT cells. Interestingly, polysulfide possesses anti-cancer activity and is able to add on more anti-cancer effect to cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Moreover, we observed that the number of sulfur atoms in polysulfide well reflected the efficacy of these molecules not only in cell protection but also cancer inhibition which may serve as a guide for further development of polysulfide donors for pharmaceutical usage.

Grx2-deficient cells ectopically expressing the wildtype form of Grx2 with its C31QFC34 active site, but not the C34S mutant, regain the sensitivity of the parental strain, indicating that the physiological role of Grx2 requires both active site cysteines. In the procyclic insect stage of the parasite, Grx2 is essential. Both alleles can be replaced if procyclic cells ectopically express authentic or C34S, but not C31S/C34S Grx2, pointing to a redox role that relies on a monothiol mechanism. RNA-interference against Grx2 causes a virtually irreversible proliferation defect. The cells adopt an elongated morphology but do not show any significant alteration in the cell cycle. The growth retardation is attenuated by high glucose concentrations. Under these conditions, procyclic cells obtain ATP by substrate level phosphorylation suggesting that Grx2 might regulate a respiratory chain component.",

However, the negative charge in their carboxylic group limits their capacity to diffuse through biological membranes, thus hindering their access to cell interior. In order to promote the diffusion of rosmarinic acid through biological membranes, we synthesized several lipophilic ester- and amide-derivatives of this compound and evaluated their capacity to prevent H2O2-induced DNA damage and apoptosis in cultured human cells. Esterification of the carboxylic moiety with lipophilic groups strongly enhanced the capacity of rosmarinic acid to protect cells. On the other hand, the amide-derivatives were somewhat less effective but exerted less cytotoxicity at high concentrations. Cell uptake experiments, using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), illustrated different levels of intracellular accumulation among the ester- and amide-derivatives, with the first being more effectively accumulated, probably due to their extensive hydrolysis inside the cells. In conclusion, these results highlight the hitherto unrecognized fundamental importance of derivatization of diet-derived phenolic acids to unveil their biological potential.",

     "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus produces bacillithiol (BSH) as major low molecular weight (LMW) thiol which functions in thiol-protection and redox-regulation by protein S-bacillithiolation under hypochlorite stress. The aldehyde dehydrogenase AldA was identified as S-bacillithiolated at its active site Cys279 under NaOCl stress in S. aureus. Here, we have studied the expression, function, redox regulation and structural changes of AldA of S. aureus. Transcription of aldA was previously shown to be regulated by the alternative sigma factor SigmaB. Northern blot analysis revealed SigmaB-independent induction of aldA transcription under formaldehyde, methylglyoxal, diamide and NaOCl stress. Deletion of aldA resulted in a NaOCl-sensitive phenotype in survival assays, suggesting an important role of AldA in the NaOCl stress defense. Purified AldA showed broad substrate specificity for oxidation of several aldehydes, including formaldehyde, methylglyoxal, acetaldehyde and glycol aldehyde. Thus, AldA could be involved in detoxification of aldehyde substrates that are elevated under NaOCl stress. Kinetic activity assays revealed that AldA is irreversibly inhibited under H2O2 treatment in vitro due to overoxidation of Cys279 in the absence of BSH. Pre-treatment of AldA with BSH prior to H2O2 exposure resulted in reversible AldA inactivation due to S-bacillithiolation as revealed by activity assays and BSH-specific Western blot analysis. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation, we further show that BSH occupies two different positions in the AldA active site depending on the AldA activation state. In conclusion, we show here that AldA is an important target for S-bacillithiolation in S. aureus that is up-regulated under NaOCl stress and functions in protection under hypochlorite stress.",

Measurement of the superoxide anion radical generated by purified recombinant soluble and membrane cytochrome b5 reductase corroborates the production of the radical by different enzyme isoforms. In the presence of cytochrome c, a burst of superoxide anion as well as the reduction of cytochrome c by cytochrome b5 reductase was measured. Complex formation between both proteins suggests that cytochrome b5 reductase is one of the major partners of cytochrome c upon its release from mitochondria to the cytosol during apoptosis.

There is scarce evidence, though, that it does not probably reflect sufficiently in vivo tissue redox profile. Instead, the Michaelis constant (Km) could more adequately image tissue oxidative stress and, thus, be a more physiologically relevant redox biomarker. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to side-by-side compare Vmax and Km of an antioxidant enzyme after implementin g an in vivo set up that induces alterations in tissue redox status. Forty rats were divided into two groups including rats injected with blood plasma originating from rats that had previously swam until exhaustion and rats injected with blood plasma originating from sedentary rats. Tail-vein injections were performed daily for 21 days. Catalase Vmax and Km measured in gastrocnemius muscle were increased after administration of the exercise-conditioned plasma, denoting enhancement of the enzyme activity but impairment of its affinity for the substrate, respectively. These alterations are potential adaptations stimulated by the administered plasma pointing out that blood is an active fluid capable of regulating tissue homeostasis. Our findings suggest that Km adequately reflects in vivo modifications of skeletal muscle catalase and seems to surpass Vmax regarding its physiological relevance and biological interpretation. In conclusion, Km can be regarded as an in vivo-like biomarker that satisfactorily images the intracellular environment, as compared to Vmax that could be aptly parallelized with a biomarker that describes tissue oxidative stress in an in vitro manner.",

Alterations in DJ-1 expression or function can disrupt homeostatic signaling networks and initiate cascades that play a role in the pathogenesis of conditions such as Parkinson's disease and cancer.DJ-1 plays a major role in various signaling pathways. Related to its anti-oxidant properties, it mediates cell survival and proliferation by activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathway and attenuates cell death signaling by inhibiting apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) activation.

Previously, a mitochondria-targeted nitroxide was shown to selectively inhibit colon cancer cell proliferation at submicromolar levels. This review is centered on the therapeutic use of MTTs and their bioenergetic profiling in cancer cells. Triphenylphosphonium cation conjugated to a parent molecule (e.g., vitamin-E or chromanol, ubiquinone, and metformin) via a linker alkyl chain is considered an MTT. MTTs selectively and potently inhibit proliferation of cancer cells and, in some cases, induce cytotoxicity. MTTs inhibit mitochondrial complex I activity and induce mitochondrial stress in cancer cells through generation of reactive oxygen species. MTTs in combination with glycolytic inhibitors synergistically inhibit tumor cell proliferation. This review discusses how signaling molecules traditionally linked to tumor cell proliferation affect tumor metabolism and bioenergetics (glycolysis, TCA cycle, and glutaminolysis).",

In particular, it is linked to the etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative disease and the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Histopathological hallmarks of AD are intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular formation of senile plaques composed of the amyloid-beta peptide (A\u03b2) in aggregated form along with metal-ions such as copper, iron or zinc. Redox active metal ions, as for example copper, can catalyze the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) when bound to the amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). The ROS thus produced, in particular the hydroxyl radical which is the most reactive one, may contribute to oxidative damage on both the A\u03b2 peptide itself and on surrounding molecule (proteins, lipids, \u2026). This review highlights the existing link between oxidative stress and AD, and the consequences towards the A\u03b2 peptide and surrounding molecules in terms of oxidative damage.

     "abstract": "In this review we provide an analysis of the biochemistry of peroxynitrite and tyrosine nitration. Peroxynitrite is the product of the diffusion-controlled reaction between superoxide (O2\u2022-) and nitric oxide (\u2022NO). This process is in competition with the enzymatic dismutation of O2\u2022- and the diffusion of \u2022NO across cells and tissues and its reaction with molecular targets (e.g. guanylate cyclase). Understanding the kinetics and compartmentalization of the O2\u2022- / \u2022NO interplay is critical to rationalize the shift of \u2022NO from a physiological mediator to a cytotoxic intermediate. Once formed, peroxynitrite (ONOO- and ONOOH; pKa = 6,8) behaves as a strong one and two-electron oxidant towards a series of biomolecules including transition metal centers and thiols. In addition, peroxynitrite anion can secondarily evolve to secondary radicals either via its fast reaction with CO2 or through proton-catalyzed homolysis. Thus, peroxynitrite can participate in direct (bimolecular) and indirect (through secondary radical intermediates) oxidation reactions; through these processes peroxynitrite can participate as cytotoxic effector molecule against invading pathogens and/or as an endogenous pathogenic mediator. Peroxynitrite can cause protein tyrosine nitration in vitro and in vivo. Indeed, tyrosine nitration is a hallmark of the reactions of \u2022NO-derived oxidants in cells and tissues and serves as a biomarker of oxidative damage. Protein tyrosine nitration can mediate changes in protein structure and function that affect cell homeostasis. Tyrosine nitration in biological systems is a free radical process that can be promoted either by peroxynitrite-derived radicals or by other related \u2022NO-dependent oxidative processes. Recently, mechanisms responsible of tyrosine nitration in hydrophobic biostructures such as membranes and lipoproteins have been assessed and involve the parallel occurrence and connection with lipid peroxidation. Experimental strategies to reveal the proximal oxidizing mechanism during tyrosine nitration in given pathophysiologically-relevant conditions include mapping and identification of the tyrosine nitration sites in specific proteins.",

Accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species triggers granular mitochondria formation, while mitoTEMPO (a mitochondria-targeted superoxide scavenger) restores tubular mitochondrial morphology within A\u03b2-treated neurons. Interestingly, modulations of mitochondria fission and fusion by genetic and pharmacological tools attenuated not only the induction of granular mitochondria, but also mitochondrial superoxide levels in A\u03b2\u2212treated neurons.

In the present study, we have used WI-38 and BJ human fibroblasts as an in vitro model system to investigate the effects of siRNA-based DNMT2 silencing. DNMT2-depleted cells were found to be sensitive to oxidative stress conditions as judged by increased production of reactive oxygen species and susceptible to DNA damage that resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation. DNMT2 silencing promoted upregulation of proliferation-related and tumor suppressor miRNAs, namely miR-28-3p, miR-34a-3p, miR-30b-5p, miR-29b-3p, miR-200c-3p, miR-28-5p, miR-379-5p, miR-382-5p, miR-194-5p, miR-193b-3p and miR-409-3p. Moreover, DNMT2 silencing induced cellular senescence and DNMT2 levels were elevated in replicatively senescent cells. Taken together, we found that DNMT2 may take part in the regulation of cell proliferation and longevity in human fibroblasts and speculate that the manipulation of DNMT2 levels that limits cell proliferation may be potentially useful anticancer strategy.",

     "abstract": "Evidence from animal studies suggests that stress-induced increases in Nrf2-regulated antioxidant gene expression, a critical mechanism of cellular protection, declines with aging. This study examined whether this also occurs in humans. We measured the basal and inducible levels of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes in human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from subjects of young adult (21\u201329 years) and older (60\u201369 years) non-smokers, and explored factors affecting expresion. The basal expression of three representative Nrf2-regulated genes, the catalytic and modulator subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC and GCLM, respectively), and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), was higher in cells from the older donors compared with cells from the young adult donors. Upon exposure to the Nrf2 activator, sulforaphane (SF), the expression of these antioxidant genes was increased in cells from both the young adults and the older donors; however, the induction by SF in older donor cells was significantly less than that seen in young adult cells. In addition, the activation of an EpRE-driven reporter by SF was lower in cells from older donors compared to cells from young adults. The basal expression of Nrf2 protein was also lower in cells from older donors than cells from young adults. Furthermore, we found that the basal expression of both Bach1 and c-Myc, two Nrf2 suppressors, was higher in cells from older adults than from young adult donors. In summary, our data suggest that, as in other species, basal expression of Nrf2-regulated genes increases with aging, while inducibility declines with aging. The increased expression of Nrf2 suppressors such as Bach1 and c-Myc may contribute to the impaired inducibility of the Nrf2-regulated antioxidant genes with aging in human bronchial epithelial cells.",

     "abstract": "Although lipid peroxidation associated with oxidative stress can result in cellular death, sub-lethal lipid peroxidation can gradually resolve with return to the pre-exposure state. We have shown that resolution of lipid peroxidation is greatly delayed in lungs or cells that are null for peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) and that both the phospholipase A2 and the GSH peroxidase activities of Prdx6 are required for a maximal rate of recovery. Like other peroxiredoxins, Prdx6 can reduce H2O2 and short chain hydroperoxides, but in addition can directly reduce phospholipid hydroperoxides. This study evaluated the relative role of these two different peroxidase activities of Prdx6 in the repair of peroxidized cell membranes. The His26 residue in Prdx6 is an important component of the binding site for phospholipids. Thus, we evaluated the lungs from H26A-Prdx6 expressing mice and generated H26A-Prdx6 expressing pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVEC) by lentiviral infection of Prdx6 null cells to compare with wild type in the repair of lipid peroxidation. Isolated lungs and PMVEC were exposed to tert-butyl hydroperoxide and mice were exposed to hyperoxia (> 95% O2). Assays for lipid peroxidation in wild type control and mutant lungs and cells showed ~4-fold increase at end-exposure. Control lungs and cells showed gradual resolution during a post-exposure recovery period. However, there was no recovery from lipid peroxidation by H26A-Prdx6 lungs or PMVEC. These studies confirm an important role for Prdx6 in recovery from membrane lipid peroxidation and indicate that reduction of H2O2 or short chain hydroperoxides does not play a role in the recovery process.",

Here, we identified the mechanism by which tumor-intrinsic Yap deletion resulted in HCC migratory inhibition. Yap was greatly upregulated in HCC and its expression promoted the cells migration. Functional studies found that knockdown of Yap induced JNK phosphorylation which closely bound to the Bnip3 promoter and contributed to Bnip3 expression. Higher Bnip3 employed excessive mitophagy leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and ATP shortage. The insufficient ATP inactivated SERCA and consequently triggered intracellular calcium overload. As the consequence of calcium oscillation, Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases II (CaMKII) was signaled and subsequently inhibited cofilin activity via phosphorylated modification. The phosphorylated cofilin failed to manipulate F-actin polymerization and lamellipodium formation, resulting into the impairment of lamellipodium-based migration. Collectively, our results identified Hippo-Yap as the tumor promoter in hepatocellular carcinoma that mediated via activation of cofilin/F-actin/lamellipodium axis by limiting JNK-Bnip3-SERCA-CaMKII pathways, with potential application to HCC therapy involving cancer metastasis.",

Although the elevated expression of PKR (double stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase) and MMP-13 (collagenase-3) have been indicated to play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of OA, the exact mechanism underlying the regulation of MMP-13 by PKR following inflammatory stimulation was relatively unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the signaling pathway involved in the PKR-mediated induction of MMP-13 after TNF-\u03b1-stimulation. In this study, cartilages of knee joint were obtained from OA subjects who underwent arthroplastic knee surgery. Cartilages were used for tissue analysis or for chondrocytes isolation. In results, the upregulated expression of PKR was observed in damaged OA cartilages as well as in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated chondrocytes. Phosphorylation of PKC (protein kinase C) was found after TNF-\u03b1 administration or PKR activation using poly(I:C), indicating PKC was regulated by PKR. The subsequent increased activity of NADPH oxidase led to oxidative stress accumulation and antioxidant capacity downregulation followed by an exaggerated inflammatory response with elevated levels of COX-2 and IL-8 via ERK/NF-\u03baB pathway. Activated ERK pathway also impeded the inhibition of MMP-13 by PPAR-\u03b3. These findings demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1-induced PKR activation triggered oxidative stress-mediated inflammation and MMP-13 in human chondrocytes. Unraveling these deregulated signaling cascades will deepen our knowledge of OA pathophysiology and provide aid in the development of novel therapies.",

The process by which ascorbate oxidizes to form H2O2 is thought to be mediated catalytically by redox active metal ions such as iron (Fe). Because intravenous iron sucrose is often administered to colon cancer patients to help mitigate anemia, the current study assessed the ability of pharmacological ascorbate to kill colon cancer cells in the presence and absence of iron sucrose.In vitro survival assays showed that 10\u00a0mM ascorbate exposure (2\u00a0h) clonogenically inactivated 40\u201380% of exponentially growing colon cancer cell lines (HCT116 and HT29). When the H2O2 scavenging enzyme, catalase, was added to the media, or conditionally over-expressed using a doxycycline inducible vector, the toxicity of pharmacological ascorbate was significantly blunted. When colon cancer cells were treated in the presence or absence of 250\u00a0\u00b5M iron sucrose, then rinsed, and treated with 10\u00a0mM ascorbate, the cells demonstrated increased levels of labile iron that resulted in significantly increased clonogenic cell killing, compared to pharmacological ascorbate alone. Interestingly, when colon cancer cells were treated with iron sucrose for 1\u00a0h and then 10\u00a0mM ascorbate was added to the media in the continued presence of iron sucrose, there was no enhancement of toxicity despite similar increases in intracellular labile iron. The combination of iron chelators, deferoxamine and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, significantly inhibited the toxicity of either ascorbate alone or ascorbate following iron sucrose. These observations support the hypothesis that increasing intracellular labile iron pools, using iron sucrose, can be used to increase the toxicity of pharmacological ascorbate in human colon cancer cells by a mechanism involving increased generation of H2O2.",

In murine lung endothelial cells (MLEC) derived from these mice we observed a 50% reduction in GCLc levels compared to lung fibroblasts from the same mice. MLEC obtained from haplo-insufficient mice showed significant reduction in GSH levels as well as increased basal and stimulated ROS levels, reduced phosphorylation of eNOS (Ser 1177) and increased eNOS S-glutathionylation, compared to MLEC from wild type (WT) mice. Studies in mesenteric arteries demonstrated impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in Gclc(e/+) male mice, which was corrected by pre-incubation with GSH-ethyl-ester and BH4. To study the contribution of endothelial GSH synthesis to renal fibrosis we employed the unilateral ureteral obstruction model in WT and Gclc(e/+) mice.

     "abstract": "Cellular senescence is characterised by the irreversible arrest of proliferation, a pro-inflammatory secretory phenotype and evasion of programmed cell death mechanisms. We report that senescence alters cellular iron acquisition and storage and also impedes iron-mediated cell death pathways. Senescent cells, regardless of stimuli (irradiation, replicative or oncogenic), accumulate vast amounts of intracellular iron (up to 30-fold) with concomitant changes in the levels of iron homeostasis proteins. For instance, ferritin (iron storage) levels provided a robust biomarker of cellular senescence, for associated iron accumulation and for resistance to iron-induced toxicity. Cellular senescence preceded iron accumulation and was not perturbed by sustained iron chelation (deferiprone). Iron accumulation in senescent cells was driven by impaired ferritinophagy, a lysosomal process that promotes ferritin degradation and ferroptosis. Lysosomal dysfunction in senescent cells was confirmed through several markers, including the build-up of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-II) in autophagosomes. Impaired ferritin degradation explains the iron accumulation phenotype of senescent cells, whereby iron is effectively trapped in ferritin creating a perceived cellular deficiency. Accordingly, senescent cells were highly resistant to ferroptosis. Promoting ferritin degradation by using the autophagy activator rapamycin averted the iron accumulation phenotype of senescent cells, preventing the increase of TfR1, ferritin and intracellular iron, but failed to re-sensitize these cells to ferroptosis. Finally, the enrichment of senescent cells in mouse ageing hepatic tissue was found to accompany iron accumulation, an elevation in ferritin and mirrored our observations using cultured senescent cells.",

The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise training on apoptosis and inflammation in HHcy animals.

C57BL mice (8 in each group) were fed with or without 1% L-methionine (w/w) in water for 4 months to induce HHcy. We found that Hhcy repressed SIRT1 and AMPK expression and increased NADPH oxidase activity. Plasma MDA, endothelium LOX-1 and p-p38 were up-regulated by Hhcy induction. NF-\u03baB and it downstream molecules were activated under Hhcy situation, thereby promoting pro-inflammatory responses. Moreover, we also reported that Hhcy caused endothelium apoptosis involving Akt inhibition and mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways. Exercise training significantly protected against endothelium from Hhcy caused oxidative injuries. In addition, EX527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) reduced the therapeutic effects by exercise.

Yfh1 deficiency activates Aft1, a transcription factor governing iron homeostasis in yeast cells. Although the mechanisms causing this activation are not completely understood, it is assumed that it may be caused by iron-sulfur deficiency. However, several evidences indicate that activation of Aft1 occurs in the absence of iron-sulfur deficiency. Besides, Yfh1 deficiency also leads to metabolic remodeling (mainly consisting in a shift from respiratory to fermentative metabolism) and to induction of Yhb1, a nitric oxide (NO) detoxifying enzyme. In this work, we have used conditional Yfh1 mutant yeast strains to investigate the relationship between NO, Aft1 activation and metabolic remodeling. We have observed that NO prevents Aft1 activation caused by Yfh1 deficiency. This phenomenon is not observed when Aft1 is activated by iron scarcity or impaired iron-sulfur biogenesis. In addition, analyzing key metabolic proteins by a targeted proteomics approach, we have observed that NO prevents the metabolic remodeling caused by Yfh1 deficiency. We conclude that Aft1 activation in Yfh1-deficient yeasts is not caused by iron-sulfur deficiency or iron scarcity. Our hypothesis is that Yfh1 deficiency leads to the presence of anomalous iron species that can compromise iron bioavailability and activate a signaling cascade that results in Aft1 activation and metabolic remodeling.",

Mice were subjected to either 60\u00a0min of partial liver ischemia or sham-operation. Some mice were administered with 2-(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl-4-ylamino)-2-oxoethyl) triphenylphosphonium chloride (mito-TEMPO, a mitochondria-targeting antioxidant). HIR induced severe histological and functional damages of liver in both Idh2+/+ mice and Idh2-/- mice and those damages were more severe in Idh2-/- mice than in wild-type littermates. HIR induces dysfunction of IDH2, leading to the decreases of NADPH level and mitochondrial GR and GPx functions, consequently resulting in mitochondrial and cellular oxidative injury as reflected by mitochondrial cristae loss, mitochondrial fragmentation, shift in mitochondrial fission, cytochrome c release, and cell death. These HIR-induced changes were greater in Idh2-/- mice than wild-type mice. The mito-TEMPO supplement significantly attenuated the aforementioned changes, and these attenuations were much greater in Idh2-/- mice when compared with wild-type littermates. Taken together, results have demonstrated that HIR impairs in the IDH2-NADPH-GSH mitochondrial antioxidant system, resulting in increased mitochondrial oxidative damage and dysfunction, suggesting that IDH2 plays a critical role in mitochondrial redox balance and HIR-induced impairment of IDH2 function is associated with the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion-induced liver failure.",

The nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) represents a central cellular defense mechanism, and is a target for developing agents against oxidative insult-induced human lung diseases. Our previous study found that the EtOH extract of Cinnamomum chartophyllum protected human bronchial epithelial cells against oxidative insults via Nrf2 activation. In this study, a systemic phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of C. chartophyllum led to the isolation of thirty chemical constituents, which were further evaluated for their Nrf2 inducing potential using NAD(P)H: quinone reductase (QR) assay.

     "abstract": "Cancer cells exhibit mitochondrial cholesterol (mt-cholesterol) accumulation, which contributes to cell death resistance by antagonizing mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) permeabilization. Hepatocellular mt-cholesterol loading, however, promotes steatohepatitis, an advanced stage of chronic liver disease that precedes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), by depleting mitochondrial GSH (mGSH) due to a cholesterol-mediated impairment in mGSH transport. Whether and how HCC cells overcome the restriction of mGSH transport imposed by mt-cholesterol loading to support mGSH uptake remains unknown. Although the transport of mGSH is not fully understood, SLC25A10 (dicarboxylate carrier, DIC) and SLC25A11 (2-oxoglutarate carrier, OGC) have been involved in mGSH transport, and therefore we examined their expression and role in HCC. Unexpectedly, HCC cells and liver explants from patients with HCC exhibit divergent expression of these mitochondrial carriers, with selective OGC upregulation, which contributes to mGSH maintenance. OGC but not DIC downregulation by siRNA depleted mGSH levels and sensitized HCC cells to hypoxia-induced ROS generation and cell death as well as impaired cell growth in three-dimensional multicellular HCC spheroids, effects that were reversible upon mGSH replenishment by GSH ethyl ester, a membrane permeable GSH precursor. We also show that OGC regulates mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis. Moreover, OGC silencing promoted hypoxia-induced cardiolipin peroxidation, which reversed the inhibition of cholesterol on the permeabilization of MOM-like liposomes induced by Bax or Bak. Genetic OGC knockdown reduced the ability of tumor-initiating stem-like cells to induce liver cancer. These findings underscore the selective overexpression of OGC as an adaptive mechanism of HCC to provide adequate mGSH levels in the face of mt-cholesterol loading and suggest that OGC may be a novel therapeutic target for HCC treatment.",

     "abstract": "Many guanide-containing drugs are antihyperglycaemic but most exhibit toxicity, to the extent that only the biguanide metformin has enjoyed sustained clinical use. Here, we have isolated unique mitochondrial redox control properties of metformin that are likely to account for this difference. In primary hepatocytes and H4IIE hepatoma cells we found that antihyperglycaemic diguanides DG5-DG10 and the biguanide phenformin were up to 1000-fold more potent than metformin on cell signalling responses, gluconeogenic promoter expression and hepatocyte glucose production. Each drug inhibited cellular oxygen consumption similarly but there were marked differences in other respects. All diguanides and phenformin but not metformin inhibited NADH oxidation in submitochondrial particles, indicative of complex I inhibition, which also corresponded closely with dehydrogenase activity in living cells measured by WST-1. Consistent with these findings, in isolated mitochondria, DG8 but not metformin caused the NADH/NAD+ couple to become more reduced over time and mitochondrial deterioration ensued, suggesting direct inhibition of complex I and mitochondrial toxicity of DG8. In contrast, metformin exerted a selective oxidation of the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ couple, without triggering mitochondrial deterioration. Together, our results suggest that metformin suppresses energy transduction by selectively inducing a state in complex I where redox and proton transfer domains are no longer efficiently coupled.",

     "abstract": "There is a need for robust in vitro models to sensitively capture skeletal muscle adverse toxicities early in the research and development of novel xenobiotics. To this end, an in vitro rat skeletal muscle model (L6) was used to study the translation of transcriptomics data generated from an in vivo rat model. Novel sulfonyl isoxazoline herbicides were associated with skeletal muscle toxicity in an in vivo rat model. Gene expression pathway analysis on skeletal muscle tissues taken from in vivo repeat dose studies identified enriched pathways associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, energy metabolism, protein regulation and cell cycle. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress were further explored using in vitro L6 metabolic models. These models demonstrated that the sulfonyl isoxazoline compounds induced mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial superoxide production and apoptosis. These in vitro findings accurately concurred with the in vivo transcriptomics data, thereby confirming the ability of the L6 skeletal muscle models to identify relevant in vivo mechanisms of xenobiotic-induced toxicity. Moreover, these results highlight the sensitivity of the L6 galactose media model to study mitochondrial perturbation associated with skeletal muscle toxicity; this model may be utilised to rank the potency of novel xenobiotics upon further validation.",

Cerebral injury was reversed by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Here we tested if the pro-thrombotic phenotype seen in the systemic circulation and brain during diabetes was associated with increased MG-glycation of proteins, and if NAC could reverse this.The streptozotocin (STZ)-induced mouse model of type 1 diabetes was used. Thrombus formation in venules and arterioles (pial circulation) was determined by intravital videomicroscopy using the light-dye method. Circulating blood platelet-leukocyte aggregates (PLAs) were analyzed by flow cytometry 1 wk before other measurements. GSH and MG levels in platelets were measured by HPLC. MG-modified proteins, glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), and superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) levels were detected in platelets by western blot at 20 weeks. Proteins involved in coagulation were quantified by ELISA. NAC (2\u00a0mM) was given in drinking water for 3 weeks before the terminal experiment.Thrombus development was accelerated by diabetes in a time-dependent manner. % PLAs were significantly elevated by diabetes. Plasma activated plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 levels were progressively increased with diabetes duration, with tail bleeding time reduced by 20 wks diabetes. Diabetes lowered platelet GSH levels, GPx-1 and SOD-1 expression. This was associated with higher MG levels, and increased MG-adduct formation in platelets. NAC treatment partly or completely reversed the effects of diabetes.Collectively, these results show that the diabetic blood and brain become progressively more susceptible to platelet activation and thrombosis. NAC, given after the establishment of diabetes, may offer protection against the risk for stroke by altering both systemic and vascular prothrombotic responses via enhancing platelet GSH, and GSH-dependent MG elimination, as well as correcting levels of antioxidants such as SOD1 and GPx-1.",

Both Sirt1 and Sirt3 have been shown to play vital roles in resistance to cellular stress, but the interaction between these two sirtuins has not been fully determined. In this study, we investigated the role of Sirt1-Sirt3 axis in blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability after ischemia in vitro. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells and astrocytes were co-cultured to model the BBB in vitro and oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) was performed to mimic ischemia. The results of transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) showed that suppression of Sirt1 via siRNA or salermide significantly decreased BBB permeability, whereas Sirt3 knockdown increased BBB permeability. In addition, Sirt1 was shown to regulate Sirt3 expression after OGD through inhibiting the AMPK-PGC1 pathway. Application of the AMPK inhibitor compound C partially prevented the effects of Sirt1-Sirt3 axis on BBB permeability after OGD. The results of flow cytometry and cytochrome c release demonstrated that Sirt1 and Sirt3 exert opposite effects on OGD-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, suppression of Sirt1 was shown to attenuate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which contribute to the Sirt1-Sirt3 axis-induced regulation of BBB permeability and cell damage. In summary, these findings demonstrate that the Sirt1-Sirt3 axis might act as an important modulator in BBB physiology, and could be a therapeutic target for ischemic stroke via regulating mitochondrial ROS generation.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for most of primary liver cancer, of which five-year survival rate remains low and chemoprevention has become a strategy to reduce disease burden of HCC. We aim to explore the in vivo chemopreventive effect of an organoselenium-containing compound butaselen (BS) against hepatocarcinogenesis and its underlying mechanisms. Pre- and sustained BS treatment (9, 18 and 36\u00a0mg/Kg BS) could dose-dependently inhibit chronic hepatic inflammation, fibrosis, cirrhosis and HCC on murine models with 24 weeks treatment scheme. The thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), NF-\u03baB pathway and pro-inflammatory factors were activated during hepatocarcinogenesis, while their expression were decreased by BS treatment. BS treatment could also significantly reduce tumor volume in H22-bearing models and remarkably slow tumor growth. HCC cell lines HepG2, Bel7402 and Huh7 were time- and dose-dependently inhibited by BS treatment. G2/M arrest and apoptosis were observed in HepG2 cells after BS treatment, which were mediated by TrxR/Ref-1 and NF-\u03baB pathways inhibition. BS generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which could be reduced by antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI. NAC could markedly increase HepG2 cells viability. TrxR activity of HepG2 cells treated with BS were significantly decreased in parallel with proliferative inhibition. The TrxR1-knockdown HepG2 cells also exhibited low TrxR1 activity, high ROS level, relatively low proliferation rate and increased resistance to BS treatment. In conclusion, BS can prevent hepatocarcinogenesis through inhibiting chronic inflammation, cirrhosis and tumor progression. The underlying mechanisms may include TrxR activity inhibition, leading to ROS elevation, G2/M arrest and apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "Microglial NADPH oxidase (Nox2) plays a key role in chronic neuroinflammation and related dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the mechanisms behind Nox2 activation remain unclear. Here, we revealed the critical role of complement receptor 3 (CR3), a microglia-specific pattern recognition receptor, in Nox2 activation and subsequent dopaminergic neurodegeneration by using paraquat and maneb-induced PD model. Suppression or genetic deletion of CR3 impeded paraquat and maneb-induced activation of microglial Nox2, which was associated with attenuation of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Mechanistic inquiry revealed that blocking CR3 reduced paraquat and maneb-induced membrane translocation of Nox2 cytosolic subunit p47phox, an essential step for Nox2 activation. Src and Erk (extracellular regulated protein kinases) were subsequently recognized as the downstream signals of CR3. Moreover, inhibition of Src or Erk impaired Nox2 activation in response to paraquat and maneb co-exposure. Finally, we found that CR3-deficient mice were more resistant to paraquat and maneb-induced Nox2 activation and nigral dopaminergic neurodegeneration as well as motor dysfunction than the wild type controls. Taken together, our results showed that CR3 regulated Nox2 activation and dopaminergic neurodegeneration through a Src-Erk-dependent pathway in a two pesticide-induced PD model, providing novel insights into the immune pathogenesis of PD.",

To study the role of LPP3 in the myocardium, we generated a cardiac specific Plpp3 deficient mouse strain. Although these mice were viable at birth in contrast to global Plpp3 knockout mice, they showed increased mortality ~ 8 months. LPP3 deficient mice had enlarged hearts with reduced left ventricular performance as seen by echocardiography. Cardiac specific Plpp3 deficient mice had longer ventricular effective refractory periods compared to their Plpp3 littermates. We observed that lack of Lpp3 enhanced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy based on analysis of cell surface area. We found that lack of Lpp3 signaling was mediated through the activation of Rho and phospho-ERK pathways. There are increased levels of fetal genes Natriuretic Peptide A and B (Nppa and Nppb) expression indicating myocardial dysfunction. These mice also demonstrate mitochondrial dysfunction as evidenced by a significant decrease (P < 0.001) in the basal oxygen consumption rate, mitochondrial ATP production, and spare respiratory capacity as measured through mitochondrial bioenergetics. Histology and transmission electron microscopy of these hearts showed disrupted sarcomere organization and intercalated disc, with a prominent disruption of the cristae and vacuole formation in the mitochondria.

     "abstract": "The airway epithelium is a broad interface with the environment, mandating well-orchestrated responses to properly modulate inflammation. Classically, autophagy is a homeostatic pathway triggered in response to external cellular stresses, and is elevated in chronic airway diseases. Recent findings highlight the additional role of autophagy in vesicle trafficking and protein secretion, implicating autophagy pathways in complex cellular responses in disease. Th2 cytokines, IL-13 and IL-4, are increased in asthma and other airway diseases contributing to chronic inflammation. Previously, we observed that IL-13 increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) in airway epithelial cells in an autophagy-dependent fashion. Here, we tested our hypothesis that autophagy is required for IL-13-mediated superoxide production via the NADPH oxidase DUOX1. Using a mouse model of Th2-mediated inflammation induced by OVA-allergen, we observed elevated lung amounts of IL-13 and IL-4 accompanied by increased autophagosome levels, determined by LC3BII protein levels and immunostaining. ROS levels were elevated and DUOX1 expression was increased 70-fold in OVA-challenged lungs. To address the role of autophagy and ROS in the airway epithelium, we treated primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells with IL-13 or IL-4. Prolonged, 7-day treatment increased autophagosome formation and degradation, while brief activation had no effect. Under parallel culture conditions, IL-13 and IL-4 increased intracellular superoxide levels as determined by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Prolonged IL-13 activation increased DUOX1, localized at the apical membrane. Silencing DUOX1 by siRNA attenuated IL-13-mediated increases in superoxide, but did not reduce autophagy activities. Notably, depletion of autophagy regulatory protein ATG5 significantly reduced superoxide without diminishing total DUOX1 levels. Depletion of ATG5, however, diminished DUOX1 localization at the apical membrane. The findings suggest non-canonical autophagy activity regulates DUOX1-dependent localization required for intracellular superoxide production during Th2 inflammation. Thus, in chronic Th2 inflammatory airway disease, autophagy proteins may be responsible for persistent intracellular superoxide production.",

     "abstract": "Human erythropoietin is mainly recognized for its hematopoietic function; however, by binding to its receptor (EpoR), it can activate different signaling pathways as STAT, PI3K, MAPK and RAS to increase cellular differentiation or provide neuroprotective effects, among others. A recombinant human erythropoietin variant with low glycosylation and without hematopoietic effect (EpoL) was purified from skimmed goat milk. Recombinant human erythropoietin (Epo) was obtained from CHO cell line and used as control to compare EpoL effects. Neuroprotection studies were performed in PC12 cells and rat hippocampal slices. Cells were pretreated during 1\u00a0h with EpoL or Epo and exposed to oxidative agents (H2O2 or FCCP); cell viability was assayed at the end of the experiment by the MTT method. Hippocampal slices were exposed to 15\u00a0min of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) and the neuroprotective drugs EpoL or Epo were incubated for 2\u00a0h post-OGD in re-oxygenated medium. Cell cultures stressed with oxidative agents, and pretreated with EpoL, showed neuroprotective effects of 30% at a concentration 10 times lower than that of Epo. Moreover, similar differences were observed in OGD ex vivo assays. Neuroprotection elicited by EpoL was lost when an antibody against EpoR was present, indicating that its effect is EpoR-dependent. In conclusion, our results suggest that EpoL has a more potent neuroprotective profile than Epo against oxidative stress, mediated by activation of EpoR, thus EpoL represents an important target to develop a potential biopharmaceutical to treat different central nervous system pathologies related to oxidative stress such as stroke or neurodegenerative diseases.",

     "abstract": "Protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) plays important roles in the regulation of lipid homeostasis, and impairment of Akt activity has been demonstrated to be involved in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies suggest that cytochrome P4502E1 (CYP2E1) plays causal roles in the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver (AFL). We hypothesized that Akt activity might be impaired due to CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress in chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis. In this study, we found that chronic ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis was accompanied with reduced phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 in mice liver. Chronic ethanol exposure had no effects on the protein levels of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN), and led to a slight decrease of phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1) protein level. Ethanol exposure resulted in increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE)-Akt adducts, which was significantly inhibited by chlormethiazole (CMZ), an efficient CYP2E1 inhibitor. Interestingly, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated chronic ethanol-induced hepatic fat accumulation and the decline of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308. In the in vitro studies, Akt phosphorylation was suppressed in CYP2E1-expressing HepG2 (CYP2E1-HepG2) cells compared with the negative control HepG2 (NC-HepG2) cells, and 4-HNE treatment led to significant decrease of Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 in wild type HepG2 cells. Lastly, pharmacological activation of Akt by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) significantly alleviated chronic ethanol-induced fatty liver in mice. Collectively, these results indicate that CYP2E1-induced oxidative stress may be responsible for ethanol-induced suppression of Akt phosphorylation and pharmacological modulation of Akt in liver may be an effective strategy for the treatment of ethanol-induced fatty liver.",

Its potential properties include slowing aging and extending lifespan, although how exactly this is achieved remains unclear. Here, we report that EGCG promoted healthy lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans when administered throughout or only at early-to-mid adulthood. Specifically, EGCG extended lifespan in an inverted U-shaped dose-response manner. The life-extending mechanism was stimulated by EGCG-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Additionally, EGCG triggered mitochondrial biogenesis to restore mitochondrial function. The EGCG-induced increase in lifespan depends on known energy sensors such as AMPK/AAK-2, as well as SIRT1/SIR-2.1 and FOXO/DAF-16. Interestingly, aging decreased the response to EGCG and progressively neutralized its beneficial effects on longevity. Collectively, our findings link EGCG to the process of mitohormesis and suggest an inducible, AMPK/SIRT1/FOXO-dependent redox signaling module that could be invoked in different contexts to extend healthy lifespan. Its effectiveness is higher in younger adults and declines with age.",

     "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction is associated with decreased NO bioavailability and impaired activation of the NO receptor soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in the vasculature and in platelets. Red blood cells (RBCs) are known to produce NO under hypoxic and normoxic conditions; however evidence of expression and/or activity of sGC and downstream signaling pathway including phopshodiesterase (PDE)-5 and protein kinase G (PKG) in RBCs is still controversial. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether RBCs carry a functional sGC signaling pathway and to address whether this pathway is compromised in coronary artery disease (CAD). Using two independent chromatographic procedures, we here demonstrate that human and murine RBCs carry a catalytically active \u03b11\u03b21-sGC (isoform 1), which converts 32P-GTP into 32P-cGMP, as well as PDE5 and PKG. Specific sGC stimulation by NO+BAY 41-2272 increases intracellular cGMP-levels up to 1000-fold with concomitant activation of the canonical PKG/VASP-signaling pathway. This response to NO is blunted in \u03b11-sGC knockout (KO) RBCs, but fully preserved in \u03b12-sGC KO. In patients with stable CAD and endothelial dysfunction red cell eNOS expression is decreased as compared to aged-matched controls; by contrast, red cell sGC expression/activity and responsiveness to NO are fully preserved, although sGC oxidation is increased in both groups. Collectively, our data demonstrate that an intact sGC/PDE5/PKG-dependent signaling pathway exists in RBCs, which remains fully responsive to NO and sGC stimulators/activators in patients with endothelial dysfunction. Targeting this pathway may be helpful in diseases with NO deficiency in the microcirculation like sickle cell anemia, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.",

     "abstract": "Liver regeneration has important clinical importance in the setting of partial hepatectomy (PH). Following PH, quiescent hepatocytes can reenter cell cycle to restore liver mass. Hepatocyte cell cycle progression, as the basic motivations of liver regeneration, can be disrupted by multiple pathological factors such as oxidative stress. This study aimed to evaluate the role of advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) in S-phase arrest in hepatocytes. Serum AOPP level were measured during the perioperative period of PH in 33 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Normal Sprague Dawley rats, human and murine liver cell line (HL-7702 and AML-12) were challenged with AOPP prepared by incubation of rat serum albumin (RSA) with hypochlorous acid, and the effect of AOPP on hepatocytes cell cycle progression and liver regeneration was studied after PH. AOPP levels were increased following partial hepatectomy (PH) in patients with primary liver cancer. AOPP treatment impaired liver regeneration in rats following 70% partial hepatectomy. S-phase arrest was induced by AOPP administration in hepatocytes derived from the remnant liver at controlled times following partial hepatectomy in rats, and in HL-7702 and AML-12 cells. The effect of AOPP on hepatocyte S phase arrest was mainly mediated by a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, downregulation of downstream \u03b2-catenin signaling and decreased cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) expression, which inhibited S-phase progression in hepatocytes. This study provides preliminary evidence that AOPP can induce S-phase arrest in hepatocytes via the ROS-dependent, \u03b2-catenin-CDK2-mediated pathway. These findings suggest a novel pathogenic role of AOPP contributing to the impaired liver regeneration and may provide the basis for developing new strategies to improve liver regeneration in patients undergoing PH.",

     "abstract": "Products of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) stimulate melanin synthesis. Reactive sulfur species (RSS) have been shown to have strong ROS and NO scavenging effects. However, the instability and low retention of RSS limit their use as inhibitors of melanin synthesis. The free thiol at Cys34 on human serum albumin (HSA) is highly stable, has a long retention and possess a high reactivity for RSS. We report herein on the development of an HSA based RSS delivery system. Sulfane sulfur derivatives released from sodium polysulfides (Na2Sn) react readily with HSA. An assay for estimating the elimination of sulfide from polysulfide showed that almost all of the sulfur released from Na2Sn bound to HSA. The Na2Sn-treated HSA was found to efficiently scavenge ROS and NO produced from chemical reagents. The Na2Sn-treated HSA was also found to inhibit melanin synthesis in B16 melanoma cells and this inhibition was independent of the number of added sulfur atoms. In B16 melanoma cells, the Na2Sn-treated HSA also inhibited the levels of ROS and NO induced by UV radiation. Finally, the Na2Sn-treated HSA inhibited melanin synthesis from L-DOPA and mushroom tyrosinase and suppressed the extent of aggregation of melanin pigments. These data suggest that Na2Sn-treated HSA inhibits tyrosinase activity for melanin synthesis via two pathways; by directly inhibiting ROS signaling and by scavenging NO. These findings indicate that Na2Sn-treated HSA has potential to be an attractive and effective candidate for use as a skin whitening agent.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress is reported to regulate several apoptotic and necrotic cell death pathways in auditory tissues. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) can be activated under oxidative stress, which is the hallmark of parthanatos. Autophagy, which serves either a pro-survival or pro-death function, can also be stimulated by oxidative stress, but the role of autophagy and its relationship with parthanatos underlying this activation in the inner ear remains unknown. In this study, we established an oxidative stress model in vitro by glucose oxidase/glucose (GO/G), which could continuously generate low concentrations of H2O2 to mimic continuous exposure to H2O2 in physiological conditions, for investigation of oxidative stress-induced cell death mechanisms and the regulatory role of PARP-1 in this process. We observed that GO/G induced stria marginal cells (MCs) death via upregulation of PARP-1 expression, accumulation of polyADP-ribose (PAR) polymers, decline of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which all are biochemical features of parthanatos. PARP-1 knockdown rescued GO/G-induced MCs death, as well as abrogated downstream molecular events of PARP-1 activation. In addition, we demonstrated that GO/G stimulated autophagy and PARP-1 knockdown suppressed GO/G-induced autophagy in MCs. Interestingly, autophagy suppression by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) accelerated GO/G-induced parthanatos, indicating a pro-survival function of autophagy in GO/G-induced MCs death. Taken together, these data suggested that PARP-1 played dual roles by modulating parthanatos and autophagy in oxidative stress-induced MCs death, which may be considered as a promising therapeutic target for ameliorating oxidative stress-related hearing disorders.",

     "abstract": "Hyperglycemia increases the risk of oxidant overproduction in the heart through activation of a multitude of pathways. Oxidation of mitochondrial enzymes may impair their function resulting in accumulation of intermediates and reverse electron transfer, contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) becomes inappropriately activated during metabolic syndrome, increasing oxidant production. To combat excess oxidant production, the transcription factor, nuclear factor erythriod-2- related factor 2 (Nrf2), induces expression of many antioxidant genes. We hypothesized that angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1) blockade improves mitochondrial function in response to an acute glucose load via upregulation of Nrf2. To address this hypothesis, an oral glucose challenge was performed in three groups prior to dissection (n = 5\u20138 animals/group/time point) of adult male rats: 1) Long Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO; lean strain-control), 2) insulin resistant, obese Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF), and 3) OLETF + angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB; 10\u00a0mg olmesartan/kg/d \u00d7 6 weeks). Hearts were collected at T0, T60, and T120 minutes post-glucose infusion. ARB increased Nrf2 binding 32% compared to OLETF at T60. Total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were increased 45% and 66% respectively in ARB treated animals compared to OLETF. Mitochondrial enzyme activities of aconitase, complex I, and complex II increased by 135%, 33% and 66%, respectively in ARB compared to OLETF. These data demonstrate the protective effects of AT1 blockade on mitochondrial function during the manifestation of insulin resistance suggesting that the inappropriate activation of AT1 during insulin resistance may impair Nrf2 translocation and subsequent antioxidant activities and mitochondrial function.",

Moreover, repeated injection of PBN and Tempol showed cumulative analgesic effect without tolerance. However, early treatment with PBN and Tempol failed to prevent the development of CIBP. Naive rats received repetitive injection of PBN and Tempol showed no significant change regarding the nociceptive responses. Finally, PBN and Tempol treatment notably suppressed the activation of spinal microglia in CIBP rats.

They are key components of telomerase (DKC1 and NOP10) and shelterin (TIN2), and play an important role in telomere homeostasis. They participate in several fundamental cellular processes by contributing to Dyskeratosis congenita through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Presence of oxidative stress was postulated to result from telomerase ablation. However, the resulting disturbed redox status can promote telomere attrition by generating a vicious circle, which promotes cellular senescence. This fact prompted us to study if acute loss of DKC1, NOP10 and TINF2 can promote redox disequilibrium as an early event when telomere shortening has not yet taken place. We generated siRNA-mediated (DKC1, NOP10 and TINF2) cell lines by RNA interference, which was confirmed by mRNA and protein expression analyses. No telomere shortening occurred in any silenced cell line. Depletion of H/ACA ribonucleoproteins DKC1 and NOP10 diminished telomerase activity via TERC down-regulation, and produced alterations in pseudouridylation and ribosomal biogenesis. An increase in the GSSG/GSH ratio, carbonylated proteins and oxidized peroxiredoxin-6 was observed, in addition to MnSOD and TRX1 overexpression in the siRNA DC cells. Likewise, high PARylation levels and high PARP1 protein expression were detected. In contrast, the silenced TINF2 cells did not alter any evaluated oxidative stress marker. Altogether these findings lead us to conclude that loss of DKC1 and NOP10 functions induces oxidative stress in a telomere shortening independent manner.",

Moreover, data obtained during recent years point to S-nitrosylation as another redox post-translational modification putatively regulating an increasing number of plant enzymes, including cFBP1. In this study we have shown that the Pisum sativum cFBP1 can be efficiently S-nitrosylated by GSNO and SNAP, triggering the formation of the regulatory disulphide.

     "abstract": "Hypobaric hypoxia elicits several patho-physiological manifestations, some of which are known to be lethal. Among various molecular mechanisms proposed so far, perturbation in redox state due to imbalance between radical generation and antioxidant defence is promising. These molecular events are also related to hypoxic status of cancer cells and therefore its understanding has extended clinical advantage beyond high altitude hypoxia. In present study, however, the focus was to understand and propose a model for rapid acclimatization of high altitude visitors to enhance their performance based on molecular changes. We considered using simulated hypobaric hypoxia at some established thresholds of high altitude stratification based on known physiological effects. Previous studies have focused on the temporal aspect while overlooking the effects of varying pO2 levels during exposure to hypobaric hypoxia. The pO2 levels, indicative of altitude, are crucial to redox homeostasis and can be the limiting factor during acclimatization to hypobaric hypoxia. In this study we present the effects of acute (24\u00a0h) exposure to high (3049\u00a0m; pO2: 71\u00a0kPa), very high (4573\u00a0m; pO2: 59\u00a0kPa) and extreme altitude (7620\u00a0m; pO2: 40\u00a0kPa) zones on lung and plasma using semi-quantitative redox specific transcripts and quantitative proteo-bioinformatics workflow in conjunction with redox stress assays. It was observed that direct exposure to extreme altitude caused 100% mortality, which turned into high survival rate after pre-exposure to 59\u00a0kPa, for which molecular explanation were also found. The pO2 of 59\u00a0kPa (very high altitude zone) elicits systemic energy and redox homeostatic processes by modulating the STAT3-RXR-Nrf2 trio. Finally we posit the various processes downstream of STAT3-RXR-Nrf2 and the plasma proteins that can be used to ascertain the redox status of an individual.",

Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) belongs to the atypical parkinsonian diseases and is histopathologically classified as a tauopathy. Here, we report that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from the bone marrow of patients with PSP exhibit mitochondrial dysfunction in the form of decreased membrane potential and inhibited NADH-dependent respiration. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction in PSP-MSCs led to a significant increase in mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative stress, which resulted in decrease of major cellular antioxidant GSH. Additionally, higher basal rate of mitochondrial degradation and lower levels of biogenesis were found in PSP-MSCs, together leading to a reduction in mitochondrial mass. This phenotype was biologically relevant to MSC stemness properties, as it heavily impaired their differentiation into adipocytes, which mostly rely on mitochondrial metabolism for their bioenergetic demand. The defect in adipogenic differentiation was detected as a significant impairment of intracellular lipid droplet formation in PSP-MSCs. This result was corroborated at the transcriptional level by a significant reduction of PPAR\u03b3 and FABP4 expression, two key genes involved in the adipogenic molecular network. Our findings in PSP-MSCs provide new insights into the etiology of \u2018idiopathic\u2019 parkinsonism, and confirm that mitochondrial dysfunction is important to the development of parkinsonism, independent of the type of the cell.",

Autophagic vacuoles were observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in osteocyte-like MLO-Y4 cells subjected to FSS. Increased autophagic flux was further confirmed by the increased amount of the LC3-II isoform and the degradation of p62. Fluorescent puncta distributed in the cytoplasm were observed in the GFP-LC3 transformed cells subjected to FSS. Furthermore, FSS-induced ATP release and synthesis in osteocytes were attenuated by inhibiting autophagy with 3-MA. After FSS exposure, a high ratio of cell death was observed in cultures pretreated with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, with no significantly different Caspase 3/7 activity. Our results indicated that FSS induces protective autophagy in osteocytes and that mechanically induced autophagy is associated with ATP metabolism and osteocyte survival.

The levels of phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and sphingomyelins decreased in HF erythrocytes as compared with those of control subjects; however, the levels of lysoPCs, lysoPEs, and ceramides increased in HF erythrocytes.

We further validated our findings with a cohort of 115 subjects of control subjects (n=28) and patients (n=87).

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease and is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of Tau protein. \u03b1-Lipoic acid (LA) has been found to stabilize the cognitive function of AD patients, and animal study findings have confirmed its anti-amyloidogenic properties. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, especially with respect to the ability of LA to control Tau pathology and neuronal damage. Here, we found that LA supplementation effectively inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of Tau at several AD-related sites, accompanied by reduced cognitive decline in P301S Tau transgenic mice. Furthermore, we found that LA not only inhibited the activity of calpain1, which has been associated with tauopathy development and neurodegeneration via modulating the activity of several kinases, but also significantly decreased the calcium content of brain tissue in LA-treated mice. Next, we screened for various modes of neural cell death in the brain tissue of LA-treated mice. We found that caspase-dependent apoptosis was potently inhibited, whereas autophagy did not show significant changes after LA supplementation. Interestingly, Tau-induced iron overload, lipid peroxidation, and inflammation, which are involved in ferroptosis, were significantly blocked by LA administration. These results provide compelling evidence that LA plays a role in inhibiting Tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal loss, including ferroptosis, through several pathways, suggesting that LA may be a potential therapy for tauopathies.",

However, the precise upstream molecular mechanism of fission/mitophagy remains unclear. Dual-specificity protein phosphatase1 (DUSP1) regulates cardiac metabolism, but its physiological contribution in the reperfused heart, particularly its influence on mitochondrial homeostasis, is unknown. Here, we demonstrated that cardiac DUSP1 was downregulated following acute cardiac IR injury. In vivo, compared to wild-type mice, DUSP1 transgenic mice (DUSP1TG mice) demonstrated a smaller infarcted area and the improved myocardial function. In vitro, the IR-induced DUSP1 deficiency promoted the activation of JNK which upregulated the expression of the mitochondrial fission factor (Mff). A higher expression level of Mff was associated with elevated mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial apoptosis. Additionally, the loss of DUSP1 also amplified the Bnip3 phosphorylated activation via JNK, leading to the activation of mitophagy. Increased mitophagy overtly consumed mitochondrial mass resulting into the mitochondrial metabolism disorder. However, the reintroduction of DUSP1 blunted Mff/Bnip3 activation and therefore alleviated the fatal mitochondrial fission/mitophagy by inactivating the JNK pathway, providing a survival advantage to myocardial tissue following IR stress. The results of our study suggest that DUSP1 and its downstream JNK pathway are therapeutic targets for conferring protection against IR injury by repressing Mff-mediated mitochondrial fission and Bnip3-required mitophagy.",

     "abstract": "Increased permeability of the intestinal barrier is proposed as an underlying factor for obesity-associated pathologies. Consumption of high fat diets (HFD) is associated with increased intestinal permeabilization and increased paracellular transport of endotoxins which can promote steatosis and insulin resistance. This study investigated whether dietary (-)-epicatechin (EC) supplementation can protect the intestinal barrier against HFD-induced permeabilization and endotoxemia, and mitigate liver damage and insulin resistance. Mechanisms leading to loss of integrity and function of the tight junction (TJ) were characterized. Consumption of a HFD for 15 weeks caused obesity, steatosis, and insulin resistance in male C57BL/6J mice. This was associated with increased intestinal permeability, decreased expression of ileal TJ proteins, and endotoxemia. Supplementation with EC (2\u201320\u00a0mg/kg body weight) mitigated all these adverse effects. EC acted modulating cell signals and the gut hormone GLP-2, which are central to the regulation of intestinal permeability. Thus, EC prevented HFD-induced ileum NOX1/NOX4 upregulation, protein oxidation, and the activation of the redox-sensitive NF-\u03baB and ERK1/2 pathways. Supporting NADPH oxidase as a target of EC actions, in Caco-2 cells EC and apocynin inhibited tumor necrosis alpha (TNF\u03b1)-induced NOX1/NOX4 overexpression, protein oxidation and monolayer permeabilization. Together, our findings demonstrate protective effects of EC against HFD-induced increased intestinal permeability and endotoxemia.

Previous study revealed that both toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and integrin play important roles in \u03b1-synuclein-induced microglial activation. In this study, we found that blocking CD11b, the \u03b1 chain of integrin \u03b1M\u03b22, but not TLR2 attenuated \u03b1-synuclein-induced NOX2 activation in microglia. The involvement of CD11b in \u03b1-synuclein-induced activation of NOX2 was further confirmed in CD11b-/- microglia by showing reduced membrane translocation of NOX2 cytosolic subunit p47phox and superoxide production. Mechanistically, \u03b1-synuclein bound to CD11b and subsequently activated Rho signaling pathway. \u03b1-Synuclein induced activation of RhoA and downstream ROCK but not Rac1 in a CD11b-dependent manner. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RhoA impeded NOX2 activation in response to \u03b1-synuclein. Furthermore, we found that inhibition of NOX2 failed to interfere with the activation of RhoA signaling and interactions between \u03b1-synuclein and CD11b, further confirming that NOX2 was the downstream target of CD11b. Finally, we found that genetic deletion of CD11b abrogated \u03b1-synuclein-induced NOX2 activatoin in vivo.

Therefore, the present study aimed determining whether RSV attenuates type 1 diabetes (T1D)-induced testicular apoptotic cell death in a mouse model. We found that testicular apoptosis and oxidative stress levels were significantly higher in T1D mice than control mice. In addition, the phosphorylation level of metabolism-related Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 was downregulated and Akt negative regulators PTEN, PTP1B and TRB3 were upregulated in the T1D group. These effects were partially prevented by RSV treatment. Nrf2 and its downstream genes, such as NQO-1, HO-1, SOD, catalase and metallothionein were significantly upregulated by RSV treatment. In addition, RSV-induced Nrf2 activation was found due to Keap1 degradation, mainly reliant on p62 that functions as an adaptor protein during autophagy.

Breakdown of acetaldehyde by aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) in the mitochondria consumes NAD+ and generates reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, which represents a fundamental mechanism in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). A mitochondria-targeted lipophilic ubiquinone (MitoQ) has been shown to confer greater protection against oxidative damage in the mitochondria compared to untargeted antioxidants. The present study aimed to investigate if MitoQ could preserve mitochondrial ALDH2 activity and speed up acetaldehyde clearance, thereby protects against ALD. Male C57BL/6\u00a0J mice were exposed to alcohol for 8 weeks with MitoQ supplementation (5\u00a0mg/kg/d) for the last 4 weeks. MitoQ ameliorated alcohol-induced oxidative/nitrosative stress and glutathione deficiency. It also reversed alcohol-reduced hepatic ALDH activity and accelerated acetaldehyde clearance through modulating ALDH2 cysteine S-nitrosylation, tyrosine nitration and 4-hydroxynonenol adducts formation. MitoQ ameliorated nitric oxide (NO) donor-mediated ADLH2 S-nitrosylation and nitration in Hepa-1c1c7 cells under glutathion depletion condition. In addition, alcohol-increased circulating acetaldehyde levels were accompanied by reduced intestinal ALDH activity and impaired intestinal barrier. In accordance, MitoQ reversed alcohol-increased plasma endotoxin levels and hepatic toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-NF-\u03baB signaling along with subsequent inhibition of inflammatory cell infiltration. MitoQ also reversed alcohol-induced hepatic lipid accumulation through enhancing fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation. Alcohol-induced ER stress and apoptotic cell death signaling were reversed by MitoQ. This study demonstrated that speeding up acetaldehyde clearance by preserving ALDH2 activity critically mediates the beneficial effect of MitoQ on alcohol-induced pathogenesis at the gut-liver axis.",

     "abstract": "Early B cell factor 1 (EBF1) is a transcription factor involved in the differentiation of several stem cell lineages and it is a negative regulator of estrogen receptors. EBF1 is down-regulated in many tumors, and is believed to play suppressive roles in cancer promotion and progression. However, the functional roles of EBF1 in carcinogenesis are unclear. Liver fluke-infection-associated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is an oxidative stress-driven cancer of bile duct epithelium. In this study, we investigated EBF1 expression in tissues from CCA patients, CCA cell lines (KKU-213, KKU-214 and KKU-156), cholangiocyte (MMNK1) and its oxidative stress-resistant (ox-MMNK1-L) cell lines. The formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) was used as an oxidative stress marker. Our results revealed that EBF1 expression was suppressed in cancer cells compared with the individual normal bile duct cells at tumor adjacent areas of CCA tissues. CCA patients with low EBF1 expression and high formation of 8-oxodG were shown to correlate with poor survival. Moreover, EBF1 was suppressed in the oxidative stress-resistant cell line and all of CCA cell lines compared to the cholangiocyte cell line. This suggests that prolonged oxidative stress suppressed EBF1 expression and the reduced EBF1 level may facilitate CCA genesis. To elucidate the significance of EBF1 suppression in CCA genesis, EBF1 expression of the MMNK1 cell line was down-regulated by siRNA technique, and its effects on stem cell properties (CD133 and Oct3/4 expressions), tumorigenic properties (cell proliferation, wound healing and cell migration), estrogen responsive gene (TFF1), estrogen-stimulated wound healing, and cell migration were examined. The results showed that CD133, Oct3/4 and TFF1 expression levels, wound healing, and cell migration of EBF1 knockdown-MMNK1 cells were significantly increased. Also, cell migration of EBF1-knockdown cells was significantly enhanced after 17\u03b2-estradiol treatment. Our findings suggest that EBF1 down-regulation via oxidative stress induces stem cell properties, tumorigenic properties and estrogen responses of cholangiocytes leading to CCA genesis with aggressive clinical outcomes.",

Mechanistically, PDGF-BB-treated VSMCs exhibited higher mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and P70S6K phosphorylation, which was attenuated by CA pretreatment, diphenyleneiodonium chloride (DPI), reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF\u03baB) inhibitor Bay117082.

We identified a single nucleotide polymorphism, rs667897, at the MS4A locus that creates an antioxidant response element and links MS4A6A expression to the stress responsive Cap-n-Collar (CNC) transcription factors NRF1 (encoded by NFE2L1) and NRF2 (encoded by NFE2L2). The risk allele of rs667897 generates a strong CNC binding sequence that is activated by proteostatic stress in an NRF1-dependent manner, and is associated with increased expression of the gene MS4A6A.

Our results show that carnosine treatment (100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) significantly inhibited the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG), and decreased chromosomal abnormalities in the bone marrow cells of mice treated with CTX (20\u00a0mg/kg, i.v., 24\u00a0h). Furthermore, carnosine evidently mitigated CTX-induced G2/M arrest in murine bone marrow cells, accompanied by reduced ratios of p-Chk1/Chk1 and p-p53/p53 as well as decreased p21 expression. In addition, cell apoptosis caused by CTX was also suppressed by carnosine treatment, as assessed by decreased TUNEL-positive cell counts, down-regulated expressions of Bax and Cyt c, and reduced ratios of cleaved Caspase-3/Caspase-3. These results together suggest that carnosine can protect murine bone marrow cells from CTX-induced DNA damage via its antioxidant activity.",

     "abstract": "The human DKC1 gene encodes dyskerin, an evolutionarily conserved nuclear protein whose overexpression represents a common trait of many types of aggressive sporadic cancers. As a crucial component of the nuclear H/ACA snoRNP complexes, dyskerin is involved in a variety of essential processes, including telomere maintenance, splicing efficiency, ribosome biogenesis, snoRNAs stabilization and stress response. Although multiple minor dyskerin splicing isoforms have been identified, their functions remain to be defined. Considering that low-abundance splice variants could contribute to the wide functional repertoire attributed to dyskerin, possibly having more specialized tasks or playing significant roles in changing cell status, we investigated in more detail the biological roles of a truncated dyskerin isoform that lacks the C-terminal nuclear localization signal and shows a prevalent cytoplasmic localization. Here we show that this dyskerin variant can boost energy metabolism and improve respiration, ultimately conferring a ROS adaptive response and a growth advantage to cells. These results reveal an unexpected involvement of DKC1 in energy metabolism, highlighting a previously underscored role in the regulation of metabolic cell homeostasis.",

As a major collagen receptor, platelet-specific glycoprotein (GP)VI is a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, with two extracellular Ig domains, a mucin domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail. GPVI forms a functional complex with the Fc receptor \u03b3-chain (FcR\u03b3) that, following receptor dimerization, signals via an intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM), leading to rapid activation of Src family kinase signaling pathways. Our previous studies demonstrated that an unpaired thiol in the cytoplasmic tail of GPVI undergoes rapid oxidation to form GPVI homodimers in response to ligand binding, indicating an oxidative submembranous environment in platelets after GPVI stimulation. Using a redox-sensitive fluorescent dye (H2DCF-DA) in a flow cytometric assay to measure changes in intracellular ROS, we showed generation of ROS downstream of GPVI consists of two distinct phases: an initial Syk-independent burst followed by additional Syk-dependent generation. In this review, we will discuss recent findings on the regulation of platelet function by ROS, focusing on GPVI-dependent platelet activation and thrombus formation.",

Disturbed homeostasis between overproduction of oxidant species, overcoming redox regulation and a lack of cellular antioxidant defenses, resulting in free radical-mediated pathology and subsequent neurotoxicity contributes to development of depression, schizophrenia and PTSD, their heterogeneous clinical presentation and resistance to treatment. Metabolomics is a discipline that combines different strategies with the aim to extract, detect, identify and quantify all metabolites that are present in a biological sample and might provide mechanistic insights into the etiology of various psychiatric disorders. Therefore, oxidative stress research combined with metabolomics might offer a novel approach in dissecting psychiatric disorders, since these data-driven but not necessarily hypothesis-driven methods might identify new targets, molecules and pathways responsible for development of schizophrenia, depression or PTSD. Findings from the oxidative research in psychiatry together with metabolomics data might facilitate development of specific and validated prognostic, therapeutic and clinical biomarkers. These methods might reveal bio-signatures of individual patients, leading to individualized treatment approach.

Here, quantitative biology concepts are applied to review how H2O2 fulfills a key role in information transmission. Equations described lay the foundation of H2O2 signaling, give new insights on H2O2 signaling mechanisms, and help to learn new information from common redox signaling experiments. A key characteristic of H2O2 signaling is that the ratio between reduction and oxidation of redox switches determines the range of H2O2 concentrations to which they respond. Thus, a redox switch with low H2O2-dependent oxidability and slow reduction rate responds to the same range of H2O2 concentrations as a redox switch with high H2O2-dependent oxidability, but that is rapidly reduced. Yet, in the first case the response time is slow while in the second case is rapid. H2O2 sensing and transmission of information can be done directly or by complex mechanisms in which oxidation is relayed between proteins before oxidizing the final regulatory redox target. In spite of being a very simple molecule, H2O2 has a key role in cellular signaling, with the reliability of the information transmitted depending on the inherent chemical reactivity of redox switches, on the presence of localized H2O2 pools, and on the molecular recognition between redox switches and their partners.",

This report highlights the major achievements of EU-ROS as well as research updates and new perspectives arising from its members. The EU-ROS consortium comprised more than 140 active members who worked together for four years on the topics briefly described below. The formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) is an established hallmark of our aerobic environment and metabolism but RONS also act as messengers via redox regulation of essential cellular processes. The fact that many diseases have been found to be associated with oxidative stress established the theory of oxidative stress as a trigger of diseases that can be corrected by antioxidant therapy. However, while experimental studies support this thesis, clinical studies still generate controversial results, due to complex pathophysiology of oxidative stress in humans. For future improvement of antioxidant therapy and better understanding of redox-associated disease progression detailed knowledge on the sources and targets of RONS formation and discrimination of their detrimental or beneficial roles is required. In order to advance this important area of biology and medicine, highly synergistic approaches combining a variety of diverse and contrasting disciplines are needed.",

     "abstract": "Liver failure induced by systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) is often associated with mitochondrial dysfunction but the mechanism linking SIRS and mitochondria-mediated liver failure is still a matter of discussion. Current hypotheses suggest that causative events could be a drop in ATP synthesis, opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pore, specific changes in mitochondrial morphology, impaired Ca2+ uptake, generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), turnover of mitochondria and imbalance in electron supply to the respiratory chain. The aim of this review is to critically analyze existing hypotheses, in order to highlight the most promising research lines helping to prevent liver failure induced by SIRS. Evaluation of the literature shows that there is no consistent support that impaired Ca++ metabolism, electron transport chain function and ultrastructure of mitochondria substantially contribute to liver failure. Moreover, our analysis suggests that the drop in ATP levels has protective rather than a deleterious character. Recent data suggest that the most critical mitochondrial event occurring upon SIRS is the release of mtROS in cytoplasm, which can activate two specific intracellular signaling cascades. The first is the mtROS-mediated activation of NADPH-oxidase in liver macrophages and endothelial cells; the second is the acceleration of the expression of inflammatory genes in hepatocytes. The signaling action of mtROS is strictly controlled in mitochondria at three points, (i) at the site of ROS generation at complex I, (ii) the site of mtROS release in cytoplasm via permeability transition pore, and (iii) interaction with specific kinases in cytoplasm. The systems controlling mtROS-signaling include pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators, nitric oxide, Ca2+ and NADPH-oxidase. Analysis of the literature suggests that further research should be focused on the impact of mtROS on organ failure induced by inflammation and simultaneously providing a new theoretical basis for a targeted therapy of overwhelmed inflammatory response.",

Mounting evidence linked the atherosclerosis to endothelium dysfunction; in fact, the endothelium regulates the vascular system with roles in processes such as hemostasis, cell cholesterol, hormone trafficking, signal transduction and inflammation. Several papers shed light the ability of oxysterols to induce apoptosis in different cell lines including endothelial cells. Apoptotic endothelial cell and endothelial denudation may constitute a critical step in the transition to plaque erosion and vessel thrombosis, so preventing the endothelial damaged has garnered considerable attention as a novel means of treating atherosclerosis. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site where the proteins are synthetized and folded and is necessary for most cellular activity; perturbations of ER homeostasis leads to a condition known as endoplasmic reticulum stress. This condition evokes the unfolded protein response (UPR) an adaptive pathway that aims to restore ER homeostasis. Mounting evidence suggests that chronic activation of UPR leads to cell dysfunction and death and recently has been implicated in pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction. Autophagy is an essential catabolic mechanism that delivers misfolded proteins and damaged organelles to the lysosome for degradation, maintaining basal levels of autophagic activity it is critical for cell survival. Several evidence suggests that persistent ER stress often results in stimulation of autophagic activities, likely as a compensatory mechanism to relieve ER stress and consequently cell death.

A genetic deficiency of this cofactor from mutations of biosynthetic or recycling enzymes is a well-recognized factor in the development of childhood neurological disorders characterized by motor impairments, developmental delay, and encephalopathy.

The present study identifies high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a key mediator of intestinal inflammation in NAFLD and outlines a detailed redox signaling mechanism for such a pathway. NAFLD mice showed liver damage and release of elevated HMGB1 in systemic circulation and increased intestinal tyrosine nitration that was dependent on NADPH oxidase. Intestines from NAFLD mice showed higher Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation and proinflammatory cytokine release, an outcome strongly dependent on the existence of NAFLD pathology and NADPH oxidase. Mechanistically intestinal epithelial cells showed the HMGB1 activation of TLR-4 was both NADPH oxidase and peroxynitrite dependent with the latter being formed by the activation of NADPH oxidase. Proinflammatory cytokine production was significantly blocked by the specific peroxynitrite scavenger phenyl boronic acid (FBA), AKT inhibition and NADPH oxidase inhibitor Apocynin suggesting NADPH oxidase-dependent peroxynitrite is a key mediator in TLR-4 activation and cytokine release via an AKT dependent pathway. Studies to ascertain the mechanism of HMGB1-mediated NADPH oxidase activation showed a distinct role of Receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) as the use of inhibitors targeted against RAGE or use of deformed HMGB1 protein prevented NADPH oxidase activation, peroxynitrite formation, TLR4 activation and finally cytokine release. Thus, in conclusion the present study identifies a novel role of HMGB1 mediated inflammatory pathway that is RAGE and redox signaling dependent and helps promote ectopic intestinal inflammation in NAFLD.",

Here, we demonstrated for the first time that neurons have a significant role in protecting astrocytes from ischemic injury. The cultured medium from IP neurons (IPcNCM) induced a remarkable reduction in LDH and an increase in cell viability in ischemic astrocytes in vitro. Selective neuronal loss by kainic acid injection induced a significant increase in apoptotic astrocyte numbers in the brain of ischemic rats in vivo. Furthermore, TUNEL analysis, DNA ladder assay, and the measurements of ROS, GSH, pro- and anti-apoptotic factors, anti-oxidant enzymes and signal molecules in vitro and/or in vivo demonstrated that IP neurons protect astrocytes by an EPO-mediated inhibition of pro-apoptotic signals, activation of anti-apoptotic proteins via the P13K/ERK/STAT5 pathways and activation of anti-oxidant proteins via up-regulation of anti-oxidant enzymes. We demonstrated the existence of astro-protection by IP neurons under ischemia and proposed that the bi-directionally protective communications between cells might be a common activity in the brain or peripheral organs under most if not all pathological conditions.",

     "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of chronic, relapsing, immunological, inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). It has been reported that UC, which is studied using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model, is associated with the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the apoptosis of intestine epithelial cells (IEC). Mitochondrial NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) has been reported as an essential enzyme in the mitochondrial antioxidant system via generation of NADPH. Therefore, we evaluated the role of IDH2 in DSS-induced colitis using IDH2-deficient (IDH2-/-) mice. We observed that DSS-induced colitis in IDH2-/- mice was more severe than that in wild-type IDH2+/+ mice. Our results also suggest that IDH2 deficiency exacerbates PUMA-mediated apoptosis, resulting from NF-\u03baB activation regulated by histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. In addition, DSS-induced colitis is ameliorated by an antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) through attenuation of oxidative stress, resulting from deficiency of the IDH2 gene. In conclusion, deficiency of IDH2 leads to increased mitochondrial ROS levels, which inhibits HDAC activity, and the activation of NF-\u03baB via acetylation is enhanced by attenuated HDAC activity, which causes PUMA-mediated apoptosis of IEC in DSS-induced colitis. The present study supported the rationale for targeting IDH2 as an important cancer chemoprevention strategy, particularly in the prevention of colorectal cancer.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia refers to the involuntary loss of skeletal muscle and is a predictor of physical disability/mortality. Its pathogenesis is poorly understood, although roles for altered hypoxic signaling, oxidative stress, adipokines and inflammatory mediators have been suggested. Sarcopenia also occurs upon exposure to the hypoxia of high altitude. Using data from the Caudwell Xtreme Everest expedition we therefore sought to analyze the extent of hypoxia-induced body composition changes and identify putative pathways associated with fat-free mass (FFM) and fat mass (FM) loss.After baseline testing in London (75\u00a0m), 24 investigators ascended from Kathmandu (1300\u00a0m) to Everest base camp (EBC 5300\u00a0m) over 13 days. Fourteen investigators climbed above EBC, eight of whom reached the summit (8848\u00a0m). Assessments were conducted at baseline, during ascent and after one, six and eight week(s) of arrival at EBC. Changes in body composition (FM, FFM, total body water, intra- and extra-cellular water) were measured by bioelectrical impedance. Biomarkers of nitric oxide and oxidative stress were measured together with adipokines, inflammatory, metabolic and vascular markers.Participants lost a substantial, but variable, amount of body weight (7.3\u00b14.9\u00a0kg by expedition end; p<0.001). A progressive loss of both FM and FFM was observed, and after eight weeks, the proportion of FFM loss was 48% greater than FM loss (p<0.008). Changes in protein carbonyls (p<0.001) were associated with a decline in FM whereas 4-hydroxynonenal (p<0.001) and IL-6 (p<0.001) correlated with FFM loss. GLP-1 (r=\u22120.45, p<0.001) and nitrite (r=\u22120.29, p<0.001) concentration changes were associated with FFM loss. In a multivariate model, GLP-1, insulin and nitrite were significant predictors of FFM loss while protein carbonyls were predicted FM loss.The putative role of GLP-1 and nitrite as mediators of the effects of hypoxia on FFM is an intriguing finding. If confirmed, nutritional and pharmacological interventions targeting these pathways may offer new avenues for prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.",

     "abstract": "Insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II) is a naturally occurring hormone that exerts neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases and ageing. Accumulating evidence suggests that the effects of IGF-II in the brain may be explained by its binding to the specific transmembrane receptor, IGFII/M6P receptor (IGF-IIR). However, relatively little is known regarding the role of IGF-II through IGF-IIR in neuroprotection. Here, using adult cortical neuronal cultures, we investigated whether IGF-II exhibits long-term antioxidant effects and neuroprotection at the synaptic level after oxidative damage induced by high and transient levels of corticosterone (CORT). Furthermore, the involvement of the IGF-IIR was also studied to elucidate its role in the neuroprotective actions of IGF-II. We found that neurons treated with IGF-II after CORT incubation showed reduced oxidative stress damage and recovered antioxidant status (normalized total antioxidant status, lipid hydroperoxides and NAD(P) H:quinone oxidoreductase activity). Similar results were obtained when mitochondria function was analysed (cytochrome c oxidase activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and subcellular mitochondrial distribution). Furthermore, neuronal impairment and degeneration were also assessed (synaptophysin and PSD-95 expression, presynaptic function and FluoroJade B\u00ae stain). IGF-II was also able to recover the long-lasting neuronal cell damage. Finally, the effects of IGF-II were not blocked by an IGF-IR antagonist, suggesting the involvement of IGF-IIR. Altogether these results suggest that, in or model, IGF-II through IGF-IIR is able to revert the oxidative damage induced by CORT. In accordance with the neuroprotective role of the IGF-II/IGF-IIR reported in our study, pharmacotherapy approaches targeting this pathway may be useful for the treatment of diseases associated with cognitive deficits (i.e., neurodegenerative disorders, depression, etc.).",

Absence of the ROS-generating NADPH oxidase NOX2 in chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) patients, predominantly manifests as immune deficiency, but has also been associated with decreased cognition. Here, we investigate the role of NOX enzymes in neuronal homeostasis in adult mouse brain and in neural cells derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). High levels of NOX2 were found in mouse adult neurogenic regions. In NOX2-deficient mice, neurogenic regions showed diminished redox modifications, as well as decrease in neuroprecursor numbers and in expression of genes involved in neural differentiation including NES, BDNF and OTX2. iPSC from healthy subjects and patients with CGD were used to study the role of NOX2 in human in vitro neuronal development. Expression of NOX2 was low in undifferentiated iPSC, upregulated upon neural induction, and disappeared during neuronal differentiation. In human neurospheres, NOX2 protein and ROS generation were polarized within the inner cell layer of rosette structures. NOX2 deficiency in CGD-iPSCs resulted in an abnormal neural induction in vitro, as revealed by a reduced expression of neuroprogenitor markers (NES, BDNF, OTX2, NRSF/REST), and a decreased generation of mature neurons. Vector-mediated NOX2 expression in NOX2-deficient iPSCs rescued neurogenesis. Taken together, our study provides novel evidence for a regulatory role of NOX2 during early stages of neurogenesis in mouse and human.",

Using purified xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), chemiluminescence and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, we found that XOR catalyzes nitric oxide (NO) generation from NDHP under anaerobic conditions, and that thiols are not involved or required in this process. Further mechanistic studies revealed that NDHP could be reduced to NO at both the FAD and the molybdenum sites of XOR, but that the FAD site required an unoccupied molybdenum site. Conversely, the molybdenum site was able to reduce NDHP independently of an active FAD site. Moreover, using isolated vessels in a myograph, we demonstrate that NDHP dilates pre-constricted mesenteric arteries from rats and mice. These effects were diminished when XOR was blocked using the selective inhibitor febuxostat. Finally, we demonstrate that NDHP, in contrast to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), is not subject to development of tolerance in isolated mesenteric arteries.",

     "abstract": "NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) is a redox active, membrane-associated protein that contributes to genomic instability, redox signaling, and radiation sensitivity in human cancers based on its capacity to generate H2O2 constitutively. Most studies of NOX4 in malignancy have focused on the evaluation of a small number of tumor cell lines and not on human tumor specimens themselves; furthermore, these studies have often employed immunological tools that have not been well characterized. To determine the prevalence of NOX4 expression across a broad range of solid tumors, we developed a novel monoclonal antibody that recognizes a specific extracellular region of the human NOX4 protein, and that does not cross-react with any of the other six members of the NOX gene family. Evaluation of 20 sets of epithelial tumors revealed, for the first time, high levels of NOX4 expression in carcinomas of the head and neck (15/19 patients), esophagus (12/18 patients), bladder (10/19 patients), ovary (6/17 patients), and prostate (7/19 patients), as well as malignant melanoma (7/15 patients) when these tumors were compared to histologically-uninvolved specimens from the same organs. Detection of NOX4 protein upregulation by low levels of TGF-\u03b21 demonstrated the sensitivity of this new probe; and immunofluorescence experiments found that high levels of endogenous NOX4 expression in ovarian cancer cells were only demonstrable associated with perinuclear membranes. These studies suggest that NOX4 expression is upregulated, compared to normal tissues, in a well-defined, and specific group of human carcinomas, and that its expression is localized on intracellular membranes in a fashion that could modulate oxidative DNA damage.",

Here, we demonstrated that the glycolysis dominant metabolism of ALDHbr cells is permissive to restore blood flow in an ischemic hind limb model compared with bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMNCs). PCR array analysis showed overtly elevated Aldh2 expression of ALDHbr cells following hypoxic challenge. Notably, ALDHbr cells therapy induced blood flow recovery in this model was reduced in case of ALDH2 deficiency. Moreover, significantly reduced glycolysis flux and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected in ALDHbr cell from Aldh2-/- mice. Compromised effect on blood flow recovery was also noticed post transplanting the human ALDHbr cell from ALDH2 deficient patients (GA or AA genotypes) in this ischemic hindlimb mice model.

     "abstract": "Redox signaling is important for embryogenesis, guiding pathways that govern processes crucial for embryo patterning, including cell polarization, proliferation, and apoptosis. Exposure to pro-oxidants during this period can be deleterious, resulting in altered physiology, teratogenesis, later-life diseases, or lethality. We previously reported that the glutathione antioxidant defense system becomes increasingly robust, including a doubling of total glutathione and dynamic shifts in the glutathione redox potential at specific stages during embryonic development in the zebrafish, Danio rerio. However, the mechanisms underlying these changes are unclear, as is the effectiveness of the glutathione system in ameliorating oxidative insults to the embryo at different stages. Here, we examine how the glutathione system responds to the model pro-oxidants tert-butylhydroperoxide and tert-butylhydroquinone at different developmental stages, and the role of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf) proteins in regulating developmental glutathione redox status. Embryos became increasingly sensitive to pro-oxidants after 72\u00a0h post-fertilization (hpf), after which the duration of the recovery period for the glutathione redox potential was increased. To determine whether the doubling of glutathione or the dynamic changes in glutathione redox potential are mediated by zebrafish paralogs of Nrf transcription factors, morpholino oligonucleotides were used to knock down translation of Nrf1 and Nrf2 (nrf1a, nrf1b, nrf2a, nrf2b). Knockdown of Nrf1a or Nrf1b perturbed glutathione redox state until 72 hpf. Knockdown of Nrf2 paralogs also perturbed glutathione redox state but did not significantly affect the response of glutathione to pro-oxidants. Nrf1b morphants had decreased gene expression of glutathione synthesis enzymes, while hsp70 increased in Nrf2b morphants. This work demonstrates that despite having a more robust glutathione system, embryos become more sensitive to oxidative stress later in development, and that neither Nrf1 nor Nrf2 alone appear to be essential for the response and recovery of glutathione to oxidative insults.",

RITA can induce exclusive apoptosis in cancer cells independently of the p53 pathway; however, the resistance of cancer cells remains a major drawback. Here, we found a novel resistance mechanism of RITA treatment and an effective combined treatment to overcome RITA resistance in head and neck cancer (HNC) cells. The effects of RITA and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were tested in different HNC cell lines, including cisplatin-resistant and acquired RITA-resistant HNC cells. The effects of each drug alone and in combination were assessed by measuring cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, glutathione, reactive oxygen species, protein expression, genetic inhibition of p62 and Nrf2, and a mouse xenograft model of cisplatin-resistant HNC. RITA induced apoptosis of HNC cells at different levels without significantly inhibiting normal cell viability. Following RITA treatment, RITA-resistant HNC cells exhibited a sustained expression of other autophagy-related proteins, overexpressed p62, and displayed activation of the Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant pathway. The autophagy inhibitor 3-MA sensitized resistant HNC cells to RITA treatment via the dual inhibition of molecules related to the autophagy and antioxidant systems. Silencing of the p62 gene augmented the combined effects. The effective antitumor activity of RITA plus 3-MA was also confirmed in vivo in mouse xenograft models transplanted with resistant HNC cells, showing increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. The results indicate that RITA plus 3-MA can help overcome RITA resistance in HNC cells.This study revealed a novel RITA resistant mechanism associated with the sustained induction of autophagy, p62 overexpression, and Keap1-Nrf2 antioxidant system activation.

Because of its similarity to the bacterial one, mitochondrial translation system is an off-target for these compounds. To study the influence of the ribosomal antibiotic linezolid on adipokine production, we analyzed its effects on adipocyte secretome.

It has been suggested that mitochondrial defects in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) underlies AMD pathology. To test this idea, we developed primary cultures of RPE to ask whether RPE from donors with AMD differ in their metabolic profile compared with healthy age-matched donors. Analysis of gene expression, protein content, and RPE function showed that these cultured cells replicated many of the cardinal features of RPE in vivo. Using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer to measure bioenergetics, we observed RPE from donors with AMD exhibited reduced mitochondrial and glycolytic function compared with healthy donors. RPE from AMD donors were also more resistant to oxidative inactivation of these two energy-producing pathways and were less susceptible to oxidation-induced cell death compared with cells from healthy donors. Investigation of the potential mechanism responsible for differences in bioenergetics and resistance to oxidative stress showed RPE from AMD donors had increased PGC1\u03b1 protein as well as differential expression of multiple genes in response to an oxidative challenge. Based on our data, we propose that cultured RPE from donors phenotyped for the presence or absence of AMD provides an excellent model system for studying \u201cAMD in a dish\u201d.

HPW-RX40 inhibited the activity of recombinant PDI family proteins (PDI, ERp57, and ERp5) as well as suppressed cell surface PDI activity of platelets in a reversible manner. Exogenous addition of PDI attenuated the inhibitory effect of HPW-RX40 on GPIIb/IIIa activation. Structure-based molecular docking simulations indicated that HPW-RX40 binds to the active site of PDI by forming hydrogen bonds. In addition, HPW-RX40 neither affected the cell viability nor induced endoplasmic reticulum stress in human cancer A549 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, our results suggest that HPW-RX40 is a reversible and non-cytotoxic PDI inhibitor with antiplatelet effects, and it may have a potential for development of novel antithrombotic agents.",

     "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) compounds target both cysteine (Cys) and selenocysteine (Sec) residues in peptides and proteins. Thus, the components of the two major cellular antioxidant systems \u2013 glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin (Trx) systems \u2013 are likely targets for mercurials. Hg exposure results in GSH depletion and Trx and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) are prime targets for mercury. These systems have a wide-range of common functions and interaction between their components has been reported. However, toxic effects over both systems are normally treated as isolated events.To study how the interaction between the glutathione and thioredoxin systems is affected by Hg, human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells were exposed to 1 and 5\u00a0\u03bcM of inorganic mercury (Hg2+), methylmercury (MeHg) or ethylmercury (EtHg) and examined for TrxR, GSH and Grx levels and activities, as well as for Trx redox state. Phosphorylation of apoptosis signalling kinase 1 (ASK1), caspase-3 activity and the number of apoptotic cells were evaluated to investigate the induction of Trx-mediated apoptotic cell death. Additionally, primary cerebellar neurons from mice depleted of mitochondrial Grx2 (mGrx2D) were used to examine the link between Grx activity and Trx function.Results showed that Trx was affected at higher exposure levels than TrxR, especially for EtHg. GSH levels were only significantly affected by exposure to a high concentration of EtHg. Depletion of GSH with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) severely increased Trx oxidation by Hg. Notably, EtHg-induced oxidation of Trx was significantly enhanced in primary neurons of mGrx2D mice. Our results suggest that GSH/Grx acts as backups for TrxR in neuronal cells to maintain Trx turnover during Hg exposure, thus linking different mechanisms of molecular and cellular toxicity. Finally, Trx oxidation by Hg compounds was associated to apoptotic hallmarks, including increased ASK-1 phosphorylation, caspase-3 activation and increased number of apoptotic cells.",

     "abstract": "Insulin resistance promotes vascular endothelial dysfunction and subsequent development of cardiovascular disease. Previously we found that skeletal muscle arteriolar flow-induced dilation (FID) was reduced following a hyperinsulinemic clamp in healthy adults. Therefore, we hypothesized that hyperinsulinemia, a hallmark of insulin resistance, contributes to microvascular endothelial cell dysfunction via inducing oxidative stress that is mediated by NADPH oxidase (Nox) system. We examined the effect of insulin, at levels that are comparable with human hyperinsulinemia on 1) FID of isolated arterioles from human skeletal muscle tissue in the presence and absence of Nox inhibitors and 2) human adipose microvascular endothelial cell (HAMECs) expression of nitric oxide (NO), endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), and Nox-mediated oxidative stress. In six lean healthy participants (mean age 25.5\u00b11.6 y, BMI 21.8\u00b10.9), reactive oxygen species (ROS) were increased while NO and arteriolar FID were reduced following 60\u00a0min of ex vivo insulin incubation. These changes were reversed after co-incubation with the Nox isoform 2 (Nox2) inhibitor, VAS2870. In HAMECs, insulin-induced time-dependent increases in Nox2 expression and P47phox phosphorylation were echoed by elevations of superoxide production. In contrast, phosphorylation of eNOS and expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD2 and SOD3) isoforms showed a biphasic response with an increased expression at earlier time points followed by a steep reduction phase. Insulin induced eNOS uncoupling that was synchronized with a drop of NO and a surge of ROS production. These effects were reversed by Tempol (SOD mimetic), Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4; eNOS cofactor), and VAS2870. Finally, insulin induced nitrotyrosine formation which was reversed by inhibiting NO or superoxide generation. In conclusions, hyperinsulinemia may reduce FID via inducing Nox2-mediated superoxide production in microvascular endothelial cells which reduce the availability of NO and enhances peroxynitrite formation. Therefore, the Nox2 pathway should be considered as a target for the prevention of oxidative stress-associated endothelial dysfunction during hyperinsulinemia.",

Endothelial cell and monocyte dysfunction with subsequent extravagant inflammation are the main causes of vessel damage in CAD. Thus, strategies that repress cell death and manage unsuitable pro-inflammatory responses in CAD are potential therapeutic strategies for improving the clinical prognosis of patients with CAD. SIRT1 (Sirtuin 1) plays an important role in regulating cellular physiological processes. SIRT1 is also thought to protect the cardiovascular system by means of its antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-apoptosis activities. In the present study, we found that the SIRT1 expression levels were repressed and the acetylated p53 expression levels were enhanced in the monocytes of patients with CAD. LOX-1/oxidative stress was also up-regulated in the monocytes of patients with CAD, thereby increasing pro-apoptotic events and pro-inflammatory responses. We also demonstrated that monocytes from CAD patients caused endothelial adhesion molecule activation and the adherence of monocytes and endothelial cells. Our findings may explain why CAD patients remain at an increased risk of long-term recurrent ischemic events and provide new knowledge regarding the management of clinical CAD patients.",

S-glutathionylation of Cys244 in the AD and Cys 454-458-459 in the NBD inhibited the enzyme and protected cysteines\u2019 thiol groups from irreversible oxidation under hypoxic conditions. In this study mutagenesis approach was used to assess the role these cysteines play in regulation of the Na,K-ATPase hydrolytic and signaling functions. Several constructs of mouse \u03b11 subunit of the Na,K-ATPase were produced in which Cys244, Cys 454-458-459 or Cys 244-454-458-459 were replaced by alanine. These constructs were expressed in human HEK293 cells. Non-transfected cells and those expressing murine \u03b11 subunit were exposed to hypoxia or treated with oxidized glutathione (GSSG). Both conditions induced inhibition of the wild type Na,K-ATPase. Enzymes containing mutated mouse \u03b11 lacking Cys244 or all four cysteines (Cys 244-454-458-459) were insensitive to hypoxia. Inhibitory effect of GSSG was observed for wild type murine Na,K-ATPase, but was less pronounced in Cys454-458-459Ala mutant and completely absent in the Cys244Ala and Cys 244-454-458-459Ala mutants. In cells, expressing wild type enzyme, ouabain induced activation of Src and Erk kinases under normoxic conditions, whereas under hypoxic conditions this effect was inversed. Cys454-458-459Ala substitution abolished Src kinase activation in response to ouabain treatment, uncoupled Src from Erk signaling, and interfered with O2-sensitivity of Na,K-ATPase signaling function. Moreover, modeling predicted that S-glutathionylation of Cys 458 and 459 should prevent inhibitory binding of Src to NBD. Our data indicate for the first time that cysteine residues within the AD and NBD influence hydrolytic as well as receptor function of the Na,K-ATPase and alter responses of the enzyme to hypoxia or upon treatment with cardiotonic steroids.",

Inorganic nitrate can form NO in vivo via NO synthase-independent pathways and may thus provide beneficial effects during IR. Herein we evaluated the effects of dietary nitrate supplementation in a renal IR model. Male mice (C57BL/6J) were fed nitrate-supplemented chow (1.0\u00a0mmol/kg/day) or standard chow for two weeks prior to 30\u00a0min ischemia and during the reperfusion period. Unilateral renal IR caused profound tubular and glomerular damage in the ischemic kidney. Renal function, assessed by plasma creatinine levels, glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow, was also impaired after IR. All these pathologies were significantly improved by nitrate. Mechanistically, nitrate treatment reduced renal superoxide generation, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-12 p70) and macrophage infiltration in the kidney. Moreover, nitrate reduced mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemo attractors, while increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines in the injured kidney. In another cohort of mice, two weeks of nitrate supplementation lowered superoxide generation and IL-6 expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages. Our study demonstrates protective effect of dietary nitrate in renal IR injury that may be mediated via modulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory responses. These novel findings suggest that nitrate supplementation deserve further exploration as a potential treatment in patients at high risk of renal IR injury.",

     "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome has been reported to be activated by atherogenic factors, whereby endothelial injury and consequent atherosclerotic lesions are triggered in the arterial wall. However, the mechanisms activating and regulating NLRP3 inflammasomes remain poorly understood. The present study tested whether acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and ceramide associated membrane raft (MR) signaling platforms contribute to the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes and atherosclerotic lesions during hypercholesterolemia. We found that 7-ketocholesterol (7-Keto) or cholesterol crystal (ChC) markedly increased the formation and activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in mouse carotid arterial endothelial cells (CAECs), as shown by increased colocalization of NLRP3 with ASC or caspase-1, enhanced caspase-1 activity and elevated IL-1\u03b2 levels, which were markedly attenuated by mouse Asm siRNA, ASM inhibitor- amitriptyline, and deletion of mouse Asm gene. In CAECs with NLRP3 inflammasome formation, membrane raft (MR) clustering with NADPH oxidase subunits was found remarkably increased as shown by CTXB (MR marker) and gp91phox aggregation indicating the formation of MR redox signaling platforms. This MR clustering was blocked by MR disruptor (MCD), ROS scavenger (Tempol) and TXNIP inhibitor (verapamil), accompanied by attenuation of 7-Keto or ChC-induced increase in caspase-1 activity. In animal experiments, Western diet fed mice with partially ligated left carotid artery (PLCA) were found to have significantly increased neointimal formation, which was associated with increased NLRP3 inflammasome formation and IL-1\u03b2 production in the intima of Asm+/+ mice but not in Asm-/- mice. These results suggest that Asm gene and ceramide associated MR clustering are essential to endothelial inflammasome activation and dysfunction in the carotid arteries, ultimately determining the extent of atherosclerotic lesions.",

     "abstract": "Recently published in vitro and in vivo findings strongly suggest that BBB impairment and increased risk for stroke by tobacco smoke (TS) closely resemble that of type-2 diabetes (2DM) and develop largely in response to common key modulators such oxidative stress (OS), inflammation and alterations of the endogenous antioxidative response system (ARE) regulated by the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2). Preclinical studies have also shown that nicotine (the principal e-liquid's ingredient used in e-cigarettes) can also cause OS, exacerbation of cerebral ischemia and secondary brain injury. Herein we provide evidence that likewise to TS, chronic e-Cigarette (e-Cig) vaping can be prodromal to the loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity and vascular inflammation as well as act as a promoting factor for the onset of stroke and worsening of post-ischemic brain injury. In addition, recent reports have shown that Metformin (MF) treatment before and after ischemic injury reduces stress and inhibits inflammatory responses. Recent published data by our group revealead that MF promotes the activation of counteractive mechanisms mediated by the activation of Nrf2 which drastically reduce TS toxicity at the brain and cerebrovascular levels and protect BBB integrity. In this study we provide additional in vivo evidence showing that MF can effectively reduce the oxidative and inflammatory risk for stroke and attenuate post-ischemic brain injury promoted by TS and e-Cig vaping. Our data also suggest that MF administration could be extended as prophylactic care during the time window required for the renormalization of the risk levels of stroke following smoking cessation thus further studies in that direction are warrated.",

One promising biomarker is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanosine (8-oxoGuo) that represents intracellular oxidative stress. We investigated the ability of microalbuminuria (MA) and urinary 8-oxoGuo, alone and in combination, to predict mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in patients with type 2 diabetes.We used data from 1381 newly diagnosed diabetes patients, and urinary albumin and 8-oxoGuo were assessed in morning urine collected at the time of diabetes diagnosis and at a follow-up visit 6 years later. Associations between the urinary markers and mortality and CVD were assessed in Cox proportional hazards regression models. Test performance was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value for 10-year mortality and 10-year incidence of CVD.Both 8-oxoGuo and urinary albumin were statistically significantly associated with all-cause mortality at diagnosis as well as at 6-year follow-up. At diagnosis only urinary albumin was associated with CVD. In contrast, only 8-oxoGuo was associated with CVD at 6-year follow-up. When investigating test performance, we found that by combining information from MA and 8-oxoGuo the ability to correctly identify patients at risk could be improved.The findings suggest that measurement of urinary 8-oxoGuo provides additional information about risk to that obtained from urinary albumin, and that the combined use of 8-oxoGuo and urinary albumin could be useful for a better identification of patients at risk of CVD and death.",

     "abstract": "Hyperglycemia associated with inflammation and oxidative stress is a major cause of vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular disease in diabetes. Recent data reports that a selective sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), empagliflozin (Jardiance\u00ae), ameliorates glucotoxicity via excretion of excess glucose in urine (glucosuria) and significantly improves cardiovascular mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The overarching hypothesis is that hyperglycemia and glucotoxicity are upstream of all other complications seen in diabetes. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of empagliflozin on glucotoxicity, \u03b2-cell function, inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Male ZDF rats were used as a model of T2DM (35 diabetic ZDF\u2010Leprfa/fa and 16 ZDF-Lepr+/+ controls). Empagliflozin (10 and 30\u00a0mg/kg/d) was administered via drinking water for 6 weeks. Treatment with empagliflozin restored glycemic control. Empagliflozin improved endothelial function (thoracic aorta) and reduced oxidative stress in the aorta and in blood of diabetic rats. Inflammation and glucotoxicity (AGE/RAGE signaling) were epigenetically prevented by SGLT2i treatment (ChIP). Linear regression analysis revealed a significant inverse correlation of endothelial function with HbA1c, whereas leukocyte-dependent oxidative burst and C-reactive protein (CRP) were positively correlated with HbA1c. Viability of hyperglycemic endothelial cells was pleiotropically improved by SGLT2i. Empagliflozin reduces glucotoxicity and thereby prevents the development of endothelial dysfunction, reduces oxidative stress and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects in ZDF rats, despite persisting hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia. Our preclinical observations provide insights into the mechanisms by which empagliflozin reduces cardiovascular mortality in humans (EMPA-REG trial).",

     "abstract": "Neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) located at the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus participate in the maintenance of synaptic networks that ensure cognitive functions during life. Although it is known that this neurogenic niche losses activity with oxidative stress and ageing, the molecular events involved in its regulation are largely unknown. Here, we studied the role of transcription factor Nuclear Factor-Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (NRF2) in the control of NSPCs destinies in the SGZ. We first describe that NRF2-knockout (Nrf2-/-) mice exhibit impaired long term potentiation, a function that requires integrity of the SGZ, therefore suggesting a cognitive deficit that might be linked to hippocampal neurogenesis. Then, we found a reduction in NSCs from birth to adulthood that was exacerbated in Nrf2-/- vs. Nrf2+/+ mice. The clonogenic and proliferative capacity of SGZ-derived NSPCs from newborn and 3-month-old Nrf2-/- mice was severely reduced as determined in neurosphere cultures. Nrf2-deficiency also impaired neuronal differentiation both the SGZ, and in neurosphere differentiation assays, leading to an abnormal production of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes vs. neurons. Rescue of Nrf2-/- NSPCs by ectopic expression of NRF2 attenuated the alterations in clonogenic, proliferative and differentiating capacity of hippocampal NSPCs. In turn, knockdown of the NRF2 gene in wild type NSPCs reproduced the data obtained with Nrf2-/- NSPCs. Our findings demonstrate the importance of NRF2 in the maintenance of proper proliferation and differentiation rates of hippocampal NSPCs and suggest that interventions to up-regulate NRF2 might provide a mechanism to preserve the neurogenic functionality of the hippocampus.",

     "abstract": "Highly active anti-retrovirus therapy (HAART) has been used to block the progression and symptoms of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Although it decreases morbidity and mortality, clinical use of HAART has also been linked to various adverse effects such as severe cardiomyopathy resulting from compromised mitochondrial functioning. However, the mechanistic basis for these effects remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that a key component of HAART, 3\ua78c-azido-3\ua78c-deoxythymidine (AZT), particularly, its active metabolite AZT-triphosphate (AZT-TP), caused mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to induction of cell death in H9c2 cells derived from rat embryonic myoblasts, which serve as a model for cardiomyopathy. Specifically, treatment with 100\u00a0\u00b5M AZT for 48\u00a0h disrupted the mitochondrial tubular network via accumulation of AZT-TP. The mRNA expression of dynamin-related protein (Drp)1 and the Drp1 receptor mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) was upregulated whereas that of optic atrophy 1 (Opa1) was downregulated following AZT treatment. Increased mitochondrial translocation of Drp1, Mff upregulation, and decreased functional Opa1 expression induced by AZT impaired the balance of mitochondrial fission vs. fusion. These data demonstrate that AZT-TP causes cell death by altering mitochondrial dynamics.",

We previously demonstrated that fatty acid synthase (FASN) induced by hypoxia is a critical lipid metabolic factor determining the therapeutic efficacy of umbilical cord blood-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (UCB-hMSCs). Therefore, we investigated the mechanism of a major mitophagy regulator controlling lipid metabolism and therapeutic potential of UCB-hMSCs. This study revealed that Bcl2/adenovirus E1B 19\u00a0kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3)-dependent mitophagy is important for reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation, anti-apoptosis, and migration under hypoxia. And, BNIP3 expression was regulated by CREB binding protein-mediated transcriptional actions of HIF-1\u03b1 and FOXO3. Silencing of BNIP3 suppressed free fatty acid (FFA) synthesis regulated by SREBP1/FASN pathway, which is involved in UCB-hMSC apoptosis via caspases cleavage and migration via cofilin-1-mediated F-actin reorganization in hypoxia. Moreover, reduced mouse skin wound-healing capacity of UCB-hMSC with hypoxia pretreatment by BNIP3 silencing was recovered by palmitic acid. Collectively, our findings suggest that BNIP3-mediated mitophagy under hypoxia leads to FASN-induced FFA synthesis, which is critical for therapeutic potential of UCB-hMSCs with hypoxia pretreatment.",

We have tested here the relevance of additional homeostatic deviations that result from loss of activity of transcription factor NRF2, a crucial regulator of multiple stress responses whose activity declines with ageing. A transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that NRF2-KO mouse brains reproduce 7 and 10 of the most dysregulated pathways of human ageing and AD brains, respectively. Then, we generated a mouse that combines amyloidopathy and tauopathy with either wild type (AT-NRF2-WT) or NRF2-deficiency (AT-NRF2-KO). AT-NRF2-KO brains presented increased markers of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation as well as higher levels of insoluble phosphorylated-TAU and A\u03b2*56 compared to AT-NRF2-WT mice. Young adult AT-NRF2-KO mice exhibited deficits in spatial learning and memory and reduced long term potentiation in the perforant pathway. This study demonstrates the relevance of normal homeostatic responses that decline with ageing, such as NRF2 activity, in the protection against proteotoxic, inflammatory and oxidative stress and provide a new strategy to fight AD.",

In this study, we carried out a metabolomics profile study on PM2.5-induced inflammation. PM2.5 from Beijing, China, was collected and given to rats through intra-tracheal instillation in vivo. Acute pulmonary injury were observed by pulmonary function assessment and H.E. staining. The lipid metabolic profile was also altered with increased phospholipid and sphingolipid metabolites in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) after PM2.5 instillation. Organic component analysis revealed that benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is one of the most abundant and toxic components in the PM2.5 collected on the fiber filter. In vitro, BaP was used to treat A549 cells, an alveolar type II cell line. BaP (4\u00a0\u03bcM, 24\u00a0h) induced inflammation in the cells. Metabolomics analysis revealed that BaP (4\u00a0\u03bcM, 6\u00a0h) treatment altered the cellular lipid metabolic profile with increased phospholipid metabolites and reduced sphingolipid metabolites and free fatty acids (FFAs). The proportion of \u03c9\u20133 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) was also decreased. Mechanically, BaP (4\u00a0\u03bcM) increased the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity at 4\u00a0h as well as the mRNA level of Pla2g2a at 12\u00a0h. The pro-inflammatory effect of BaP was reversed by the cytosolic PLA2 (cPLA2) inhibitor and chelator of intracellular Ca2+.

The proteasome is one of the targets for cancer therapy, and studies are underway to use proteasome inhibitors as anti-cancer drugs. In this study, we found that HSP90 was cleaved to a 55\u00a0kDa protein after treatment with proteasome inhibitors including MG132 in leukemia cells but was not cleaved in other tissue-derived cells. HSP90 has two major isoforms (HSP90\u03b1 and HSP90\u03b2), and both were cleaved by MG132 treatment. MG132 treatment also induced a decrease in HSP90 client proteins. MG132 treatment generated ROS, and the cleavage of HSP90 was blocked by a ROS scavenger, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). MG132 activated several caspases, and the activation was reduced by pretreatment with NAC. Based on an inhibitor study, the cleavage of HSP90 induced by MG132 was dependent on caspase 10 activation. Furthermore, active recombinant caspase 10 induced HSP90 cleavage in vitro. MG132 upregulated VDUP-1 expression and reduced the GSH levels implying that the regulation of redox-related proteins is involved. Taken all together, our results suggest that the cleavage of HSP90 by MG132 treatment is mediated by ROS generation and caspase 10 activation. HSP90 cleavage may provide an additional mechanism involved in the anti-cancer effects of proteasome inhibitors.",

We previously showed that p66Shc can serve as a biomarker for renal oxidative injury in DN patients and that p66Shc up-regulation is correlated with renal damage in vivo and in vitro. Here, we determined whether probucol ameliorates renal injury in DN by inhibiting p66Shc expression.We found that the expression of SIRT1, Ac-H3 and p66Shc in kidneys of DN patients was altered. Also, probucol reduced the levels of serum creatinine, urine protein and LDL-c and attenuated renal oxidative injury and fibrosis in STZ induced diabetic mice. In addition, probucol reversed p-AMPK, SIRT1, Ac-H3 and p66Shc expression. Correlation analyses showed that p66Shc expression was correlated with p-AMPK and Sirt1 expression and severity of renal injury. In vitro pretreatment of HK-2 cells with p-AMPK and SIRT1 siRNA negated the beneficial effects of probucol. Furthermore, we noted that probucol activates p-AMPK and Sirt1 and inhibits p66shc mRNA transcription by facilitating the binding of Sirt1 to the p66Shc promoter and modulation of Ac-H3 expression in HK-2 cells under HG ambience.Our results suggest for the first time that probucol ameliorates renal damage in DN by epigenetically suppressing p66Shc expression via the AMPK-SIRT1-AcH3 pathway.",

Here, we explored the effect of Ripk3 on mitochondrial apoptosis. Compared with wild-type mice, the infarcted area in Ripk3-deficient (Ripk3-/-) mice had a relatively low abundance of apoptotic cells. Moreover, the loss of Ripk3 protected the mitochondria against IRI and inhibited caspase9 apoptotic pathways. These protective effects of Ripk3 deficiency were relied on mitophagy activation. However, inhibition of mitophagy under Ripk3 deficiency enhanced cardiomyocyte and endothelia apoptosis, augmented infarcted area and induced microvascular dysfunction. Furthermore, ischemia activated mitophagy by modifying FUNDC1 dephosphorylation, which substantively engulfed mitochondria debris and cytochrome-c, thus blocking apoptosis signal. However, reperfusion injury elevated the expression of Ripk3 which disrupted FUNDC1 activation and abated mitophagy, increasing the likelihood of apoptosis. In summary, this study confirms the promotive effect of Ripk3 on mitochondria-mediated apoptosis via inhibition of FUNDC1-dependent mitophagy in cardiac IRI. These findings provide new insight into the roles of Ripk3-related necroptosis, mitochondria-mediated apoptosis and FUNDC1-required mitophagy in cardiac IRI.",

However, the mechanisms underlying aldosterone-promoted liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) defenestration remain unknown. Caveolin 1 (Cav1) displays close links with autophagy and fenestration. Hence, we aim to investigate the role of Cav1-related autophagy in LSECs defenestration. We found the increase of aldosterone/MR (mineralocorticoid receptor) level, oxidation, autophagy, and defenestration in LSECs in the human fibrotic liver, BDL or hyperaldosteronism models; while antagonizing aldosterone or inhibiting autophagy relieved LSECs defenestration in BDL-induced fibrosis or hyperaldosteronism models. In vitro, fenestrae of primary LSECs gradually shrank, along with the down-regulation of the NO-dependent pathway and the augment of the AMPK-dependent autophagy; these effects were aggravated by rapamycin (an autophagy activator) or aldosterone treatment. Additionally, aldosterone increased oxidation mediated by Cav1, reduced ATP generation, and subsequently induced the AMPK-dependent autophagy, leading to the down-regulation of the NO-dependent pathway and LSECs defenestration. These effects were reversed by MR antagonist spironolactone, antioxidants or autophagy inhibitors. Besides, aldosterone enhanced the co-immunoprecipitation of Cav1 with p62 and ubiquitin, and induced Cav1 co-immunofluorescence staining with LC3, ubiquitin, and F-actin in the perinuclear area of LSECs. Furthermore, aldosterone treatment increased the membrane protein level of Cav1, whereas decrease the cytoplasmic protein level of Cav1, indicating that aldosterone induced Cav1-related selective autophagy and F-actin remodeling to promote defenestration. Consequently, Cav1-related selective autophagy initiated by aldosterone-induced oxidation promotes LSECs defenestration via activating the AMPK-ULK1 pathway and inhibiting the NO-dependent pathway.",

The present study was designed to investigate whether L-Cysteine could attenuate the acute brain injury and improve neurobehavioral outcomes following HI brain injury in neonatal mice by releasing endogenous H2S. L-Cysteine treatment significantly attenuated brain edema and decreased infarct volume and neuronal cell death, as shown by a decrease in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, suppression of caspase-3 activation, and reduced phosphorylation of Akt and ERK at 72\u00a0h after HI. Additionally, L-Cysteine substantially up-regulated NF-E2-related factor 2 and heme oxygenase-1 expression. L-Cysteine also decreased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated pro-apoptotic protein expression. Furthermore, L-Cysteine had long-term effects by protecting against the loss of ipsilateral brain tissue and improving neurobehavioral outcomes. Importantly, pre-treatment with a CBS inhibitor significantly attenuated the neuroprotection of L-Cysteine on HI insult. Thus, L-Cysteine exerts neuroprotection against HI-induced injury in neonates via the CBS/H2S pathway, mediated in part by anti-apoptotic effects and reduced oxidative stress and ER stress.

     "abstract": "Deterioration of pancreatic beta-cells plays a critical role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Among the various stressors contributing to these deleterious effects, glucotoxicity and superoxides have been proposed as major players. In this context, the mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP2 is regularly associated with the stress response. In the present study, we tested the effects of UCP2 upregulation in mouse islets with beta-cell specific overexpression of UCP2 (RIP-UCP2). Islets were subjected to both chronic glucotoxicity (7 days at 30\u00a0mM glucose) and acute oxidative stress (200\u00a0\u00b5M H2O2 for 10\u00a0min). Increased UCP2 expression did not alter mitochondrial potential and ATP generation but protected against glucotoxic effects. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was altered by both glucotoxicity and oxidative stress, in particular through higher basal insulin release at non-stimulatory glucose concentrations. The secretory response to glucose stimulation was partially preserved in beta-cells overexpressing UCP2. The higher rate of cell death induced by chronic high glucose exposure was lower in RIP-UCP2 islets. Finally, superoxide production was reduced by high glucose, both under acute and chronic conditions, and not modified by UCP2 overexpression. In conclusion, upregulation of UCP2 conferred protective effects to the stressed beta-cell through mechanisms not directly associated with superoxide production.",

     "abstract": "The nuclear factor erythroid 2 like 2 (Nfe2l2/Nrf2) is a master regulator of antioxidant gene transcription. We recently identified that constitutive activation of Nrf2 (CaNrf2) caused reductive stress (RS) in the myocardium. Here we investigate how chronic Nrf2 activation alters myocardial mRNA transcriptome in the hearts of CaNrf2 transgenic (TG-low and TG-high) mice using an unbiased integrated systems approach and next generation RNA sequencing followed by qRT-PCR methods. A total of 246 and 1031 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the heart of TGL and TGH in relation to NTG littermates at ~ 6 months of age. Notably, the expression and validation of the transcripts were gene-dosage dependent and statistically significant. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified enriched biological processes and canonical pathways associated with myocardial RS in the CaNrf2-TG mice. In addition, an overrepresentation of xenobiotic metabolic signaling, glutathione-mediated detoxification, unfolded protein response, and protein ubiquitination was observed. Other, non-canonical signaling pathways identified include: eNOS, integrin-linked kinase, glucocorticoid receptor, PI3/AKT, actin cytoskeleton, cardiac hypertrophy, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. In conclusion, this mRNA profiling identified a \"biosignature\" for pro-reductive (TGL) and reductive stress (TGH) that can predict the onset, rate of progression, and clinical outcome of Nrf2-dependent myocardial complications. We anticipate that this global sequencing analysis will illuminate the undesirable effect of chronic Nrf2 signaling leading to RS-mediated pathogenesis besides providing important guidance for the application of Nrf2 activation-based cytoprotective strategies.",

     "abstract": "Methotrexate (MTX) is an immunosuppressant commonly used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Recent observations have shown that patients treated with MTX also exhibit a reduced risk for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although MTX reduces systemic inflammation and tissue damage, the mechanisms by which MTX exerts these beneficial effects are not entirely known. We have previously demonstrated that protein adducts formed by the interaction of malondialdehyde (MDA) and acetaldehyde (AA), known as MAA-protein adducts, are present in diseased tissues of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or CVD. In previously reported studies, MAA-adducts were shown to be highly immunogenic, supporting the concept that MAA-adducts not only serve as markers of oxidative stress but may have a direct role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Because MAA-adducts are commonly detected in diseased tissues and are proposed to mitigate disease progression in both RA and CVD, we tested the hypothesis that MTX inhibits the generation of MAA-protein adducts by scavenging reactive oxygen species. Using a cell free system, we found that MTX reduces MAA-adduct formation by approximately 6-fold, and scavenges free radicals produced during MAA-adduct formation. Further investigation revealed that MTX directly scavenges superoxide, but not hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, using the Nrf2/ARE luciferase reporter cell line, which responds to intracellular redox changes, we observed that MTX inhibits the activation of Nrf2 in cells treated with MDA and AA. These studies define previously unrecognized mechanisms by which MTX can reduce inflammation and subsequent tissue damage, namely, scavenging free radicals, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting MAA-adduct formation.",

     "abstract": "During sepsis, the alarmin HMGB1 is released from tissues and promotes systemic inflammation that results in multi-organ damage, with the kidney particularly susceptible to injury. The severity of inflammation and pro-damage signaling mediated by HMGB1 appears to be dependent on the alarmin's redox state. Therefore, we examined HMGB1 redox in kidney cells during sepsis. Using intravital microscopy, CellROX labeling of kidneys in live mice indicated increased ROS generation in the kidney perivascular endothelium and tubules during lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced sepsis. Subsequent CellROX and MitoSOX labeling of LPS-stressed endothelial and kidney proximal tubule cells demonstrated increased ROS generation in these cells as sepsis worsens. Consequently, HMGB1 oxidation increased in the cytoplasm of kidney cells during its translocation from the nucleus to the circulation, with the degree of oxidation dependent on the severity of sepsis, as measured in in vivo mouse samples using a thiol assay and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The greater the oxidation of HMGB1, the greater the ability of the alarmin to stimulate pro-inflammatory cyto-/chemokine release (measured by Luminex Multiplex) and alter mitochondrial ATP generation (Luminescent ATP Detection Assay). Administration of glutathione and thioredoxin inhibitors to cell cultures enhanced HMGB1 oxidation during sepsis in endothelial and proximal tubule cells, respectively. In conclusion, as sepsis worsens, ROS generation and HMGB1 oxidation increases in kidney cells, which enhances HMGB1's pro-inflammatory signaling. Conversely, the glutathione and thioredoxin systems work to maintain the protein in its reduced state.",

     "abstract": "Thioridazine is known to have anti-tumor effects by inhibiting PI3K/Akt signaling, which is an important signaling pathway in cell survival. However, thioridazine alone does not induce apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (AMC-HN4), human breast carcinoma (MDA-MB231), and human glioma (U87MG) cells. Therefore, we investigated whether combined treatment with thioridazine and curcumin induces apoptosis. Combined treatment with thioridazine and curcumin markedly induced apoptosis in cancer cells without inducing apoptosis in human normal mesangial cells and human normal umbilical vein cells (EA.hy926). We found that combined treatment with thioridazine and curcumin had synergistic effects in AMC-HN4 cells. Among apoptosis-related proteins, thioridazine plus curcumin induced down-regulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational levels in a proteasome-dependent manner. Augmentation of proteasome activity was related to the up-regulation of proteasome subunit alpha 5 (PSMA5) expression in curcumin plus thioridazine-treated cells. Combined treatment with curcumin and thioridazine produced intracellular ROS in a NOX4-dependent manner, and ROS-mediated activation of Nrf2/ARE signaling played a critical role in the up-regulation of PSMA5 expression. Furthermore, ectopic expression of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 inhibited apoptosis in thioridazine and curcumin-treated cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that thioridazine plus curcumin induces proteasome activity by up-regulating PSMA5 expression via NOX4-mediated ROS production and that down-regulation of c-FLIP and Mcl-1 expression post-translationally is involved in apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) modified by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) produced by myeloperoxidase (MPO) is present in atherosclerotic lesions, where it is implicated in the propagation of inflammation and acceleration of lesion development by multiple pathways, including the induction of endothelial dysfunction. Thiocyanate (SCN-) ions are utilised by MPO to produce the oxidant hypothiocyanous acid (HOSCN), which reacts with LDL in a different manner to HOCl. Whilst the reactivity of HOCl-modified LDL has been previously studied, the role of HOSCN in the modification of LDL in vivo is poorly defined, although emerging evidence suggests that these particles have distinct biological properties. This is important because elevated plasma SCN- is linked with both the propagation and prevention of atherosclerosis. In this study, we demonstrate that both HOSCN- and HOCl-modified LDL inhibit endothelium-mediated vasorelaxation ex vivo in rat aortic ring segments. In vitro experiments with human coronary artery endothelial cells show that HOSCN-modified LDL decreases in the production of nitric oxide (NO\u2022) and induces the loss of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. This occurs to a similar extent to that seen with HOCl-modified LDL. In each case, these effects are related to eNOS uncoupling, rather than altered expression, phosphorylation or cellular localisation. Together, these data provide new insights into role of MPO and LDL modification in the induction of endothelial dysfunction, which has implications for both the therapeutic use of SCN- within the setting of atherosclerosis and for smokers, who have elevated plasma levels of SCN-, and are more at risk of developing cardiovascular disease.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) generated continuously under physiological conditions have recently emerged as critical players in the regulation of immune signaling pathways. In this study we have investigated the regulation of antiviral signaling by increased mtROS production in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which, as major producers of type I interferons (IFN), are the key coordinators of antiviral immunity. The early phase of type I IFN production in pDCs is mediated by endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), whereas the late phase of IFN response can also be triggered by cytosolic retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), expression of which is induced upon TLR stimulation. Therefore, pDCs provide an ideal model to study the impact of elevated mtROS on the antiviral signaling pathways initiated by receptors with distinct subcellular localization. We found that elevated level of mtROS alone did not change the phenotype and the baseline cytokine profile of resting pDCs. Nevertheless increased mtROS levels in pDCs lowered the TLR9-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators slightly, whereas reduced type I IFN production markedly via blocking phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), the key transcription factor of the TLR9 signaling pathway. The TLR9-induced expression of RIG-I in pDCs was also negatively regulated by enhanced mtROS production. On the contrary, elevated mtROS significantly augmented the RIG-I-stimulated expression of type I IFNs, as well as the expression of mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein and the phosphorylation of Akt and IRF3 that are essential components of RIG-I signaling. Collectively, our data suggest that increased mtROS exert diverse immunoregulatory functions in pDCs both in the early and late phase of type I IFN responses depending on which type of viral sensing pathway is stimulated.",

The exact mechanism by which GBM evades TMZ toxicity is not always related to the expression of the DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), and so remains unclear. In this study, TMZ-resistant variants derived from MGMT-negative GBM clinical samples and cell lines were studied, revealing there to be increased specificity protein 1 (Sp1) expression associated with reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation following TMZ treatment. Analysis of gene expression databases along with cell studies identified the ROS scavenger superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) as being disease-related. SOD2 expression was also increased, and it was found to be co-expressed with Sp1 in TMZ-resistant cells. Investigation of the SOD2 promoter revealed Sp1 as a critical transcriptional activator that enhances SOD2 gene expression. Co-treatment with an Sp1 inhibitor restored the inhibitory effects of TMZ, and decreased SOD2 levels in TMZ-resistant cells. This treatment strategy restored susceptibility to TMZ in xenograft animals, leading to prolonged survival in an orthotopic model. Thus, our results suggest that Sp1 modulates ROS scavengers as a novel mechanism to increase cancer malignancy and resistance to chemotherapy. Inhibition of this pathway may represent a potential therapeutic target for restoring treatment susceptibility in GBM.",

Wip1 deficiency increases migratory and phagocytic activities of the macrophage under stress conditions. Enhanced migration of Wip1-/- macrophages is mediated by Rac1-GTPase and PI3K/AKT signalling pathways. Elevated phagocytic ability of Wip1-/- macrophages is linked to CD36 plasma membrane recruitment that is regulated by AMPK activity. Our study identifies Wip1 as an intrinsic negative regulator of macrophage chemotaxis. We propose that Wip1-dependent control of macrophage function may provide avenues for preventing or eliminating plaque formation in atherosclerosis.",

It remains unclear how cells can adapt to elevated energy flux accompanied by accumulating harmful by-products without taking any damage. Therefore, effects of a sudden rise in glucose concentrations were studied in yeast cells. This revealed a feedback mechanism initiated by the reactive dicarbonyl methylglyoxal, which is formed non-enzymatically during glycolysis. Low levels of methylglyoxal activate a multi-layered defence response against toxic metabolites composed of prevention, detoxification and damage remission. The latter is mediated by the protein quality control system and requires inducible Hsp70 and Btn2, the aggregase that sequesters misfolded proteins. This glycohormetic mechanism enables cells to pre-adapt to rising energy flux and directly links metabolic to proteotoxic stress. Further data suggest the existence of a similar response in endothelial cells.",

     "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic condition caused by the triplication of chromosome 21. Persons with DS exhibit pronounced muscle weakness, which also occurs in the Ts65Dn mouse model of DS. Oxidative stress is thought to be an underlying factor in the development of DS-related pathologies including muscle dysfunction. High-levels of oxidative stress have been attributed to triplication and elevated expression of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1); a gene located on chromosome 21. The elevated expression of SOD1 is postulated to increase production of hydrogen peroxide and cause oxidative injury and cell death. However, it is unknown whether SOD1 protein expression is associated with greater oxidant production in skeletal muscle from Ts65Dn mice. Thus, our objective was to assess levels of SOD1 expression and oxidant production in skeletal myofibers from the flexor digitorum brevis obtained from Ts65Dn and control mice. Measurements of oxidant production were obtained from myofibers loaded with 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH2-DA) in the basal state and following 15\u00a0min of stimulated unloaded contraction. Ts65Dn myofibers exhibited a significant decrease in basal DCF emissions (p < 0.05) that was associated with an approximate 3-fold increase in SOD1 (p < 0.05). DCF emissions were not affected by stimulating contraction of Ts65Dn or wild-type myofibers (p > 0.05). Myofibers from Ts65Dn mice tended to be smaller and myonuclear domain was lower (p < 0.05). In summary, myofibers from Ts65Dn mice exhibited decreased basal DCF emissions that were coupled with elevated protein expression of SOD1. Stimulated contraction in isolated myofibers did not affect DCF emissions in either group. These findings suggest the skeletal muscle dysfunction in the adult Ts65Dn mouse is not associated with skeletal muscle oxidative stress.",

Male Wistar rats were exercise trained or remained sedentary for ten weeks; then, blood samples were collected, and the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated. The assembly of mitochondrial SCs and the lipid peroxidation of the mitochondrial and plasmatic fractions were assessed. Our results demonstrate that exercise induced the assembly of CI into SCs in the gastrocnemius and induced a systemic decrease in lipid peroxidation. We also found an inverse association between the superassembly of CIs and mitochondrial lipid peroxidation (p < 0.01) and protein carbonyls (p < 0.05). We conclude that exercise induces the chronic assembly of CIs into SCs, which provide mitochondrial protection against oxidative damage, at least in the studied muscle.

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress is considered a central pathophysiological event in cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. Early age reduction in renal mass is associated with hypertension and oxidative stress in later life, which is aggravated by increased salt intake. The aim of the present study was to examine if renal sympathetic denervation can exert blood pressure lowering effects in uninephrectomized (UNX) rats (3-week old) fed with high salt (HS, 4%; w/w) diet for 4 weeks. Moreover, we investigated if renal denervation is associated with changes in NADPH and xanthine oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species.Rats with UNX + HS had reduced renal function, elevated systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, which was accompanied by increased heart weight, and cardiac superoxide production compared to sham operated Controls. UNX + HS was also associated with higher expression and activity of NADPH and xanthine oxidase in the kidney. Renal denervation in rats with UNX + HS attenuated the development of hypertension and cardiac hypertrophy, but also improved glomerular filtration rate and reduced proteinuria. Mechanistically, renal denervation was associated with lower expression and activity of both NADPH oxidase and xanthine oxidase in the kidney, but also reduced superoxide production in the heart.In conclusion, our study shows for the first time that renal denervation has anti-hypertensive, cardio- and reno-protective effects in the UNX + HS model, which can be associated with decreased NADPH oxidase- and xanthine oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species (i.e., superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) in the kidney.",

Accumulating evidence from the past few decades provides strong support for the existence of interruptions in oxygen availability in fatty livers.

     "abstract": "Cells adapt to an exposure to xenobiotics by upregulating the biosynthesis of proteins involved in xenobiotic metabolism. This is achieved largely via activation of cellular xenosensors that modulate gene expression. Biotransformation of xenobiotics frequently comes with the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS, in turn, are known modulators of signal transduction processes. FOXO (forkhead box, class O) transcription factors are among the proteins deeply involved in the cellular response to stress, including oxidative stress elicited by the formation of ROS. On the one hand, FOXO activity is modulated by ROS, while on the other, FOXO target genes include many that encode antioxidant proteins \u2013 thereby establishing a regulatory circuit. Here, the role of ROS and of FOXOs in the regulation of xenosensor transcriptional activities will be discussed. Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) all interact with FOXOs and/or ROS. The two latter not only fine-tune the activities of xenosensors but also mediate interactions between them. As a consequence, the emerging picture of an interplay between xenosensors, ROS and FOXO transcription factors suggests a modulatory role of ROS and FOXOs in the cellular adaptive response to xenobiotics.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS such as H2O2, nitric oxide) confer redox regulation of essential cellular functions (e.g. differentiation, proliferation, migration, apoptosis), initiate and catalyze adaptive stress responses. In contrast, excessive formation of RONS caused by impaired break-down by cellular antioxidant systems and/or insufficient repair of the resulting oxidative damage of biomolecules may lead to appreciable impairment of cellular function and in the worst case to cell death, organ dysfunction and severe disease phenotypes of the entire organism. Therefore, the knowledge of the severity of oxidative stress and tissue specific localization is of great biological and clinical importance. However, at this level of investigation quantitative information may be enough. For the development of specific drugs, the cellular and subcellular localization of the sources of RONS or even the nature of the reactive species may be of great importance, and accordingly, more qualitative information is required. These two different philosophies currently compete with each other and their different needs (also reflected by different detection assays) often lead to controversial discussions within the redox research community. With the present review we want to shed some light on these different philosophies and needs (based on our personal views), but also to defend some of the traditional assays for the detection of RONS that work very well in our hands and to provide some guidelines how to use and interpret the results of these assays. We will also provide an overview on the \u201cnew assays\u201d with a brief discussion on their strengths but also weaknesses and limitations.",

     "abstract": "Energy metabolism and redox state are intrinsically linked. In order to mount an adequate immune response, cells must have an adequate and rapidly available energy resource to migrate to the inflammatory site, to generate reactive oxygen species using NADPH as a cofactor and to engulf bacteria or damaged tissue. The first responder cells of the innate immune response, neutrophils, are largely dependent on glycolysis. Neutrophils are relatively short-lived, dying via apoptosis in the process of bacterial killing through production of hypochlorous acid and release of extracellular NETs. Later on, the most prevalent recruited innate immune cells are monocytes. Their role is to complete a damage limitation exercise initiated by neutrophils and then, as re-programmed M2 macrophages, to resolve the inflammatory event. Almost twenty five years ago, it was noted that macrophages lose their glycolytic capacity and become anti-inflammatory after treatment with corticosteroids. In support of this we now understand that, in contrast to early responders, M2 macrophages are predominantly dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy.During early inflammation, polarisation towards M1 macrophages is dependent on NOX2 activation which, via protein tyrosine phosphatase oxidation and AKT activation, increases trafficking of glucose transporters to the membrane and consequently increases glucose uptake for glycolysis. In parallel, mitochondrial efficiency is likely to be compromised via nitrosylation of the electron transport chain.Resolution of inflammation is triggered by encounter with apoptotic membranes exposing oxidised phosphatidylserine that interact with the scavenger receptor, CD36. Downstream of CD36, activation of AMPK and PPAR\u03b3 elicits mitochondrial biogenesis, arginase expression and a switch towards oxidative phosphorylation in the M2 macrophage. Proinflammatory cytokine production by M2 cells decreases, but anti-inflammatory and wound healing growth factor production is maintained to support restoration of normal function.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes are a major public health issue worldwide. These diseases are often linked to a dysfunctional adipose tissue. Fat is a large, heterogenic, pleiotropic and rather complex tissue. It is found in virtually all cavities of the human body, shows unique plasticity among tissues, and harbors many cell types in addition to its main functional unit \u2013 the adipocyte. Adipose tissue function varies depending on the localization of the fat depot, the cell composition of the tissue and the energy status of the organism. While the white adipose tissue (WAT) serves as the main site for triglyceride storage and acts as an important endocrine organ, the brown adipose tissue (BAT) is responsible for thermogenesis. Beige adipocytes can also appear in WAT depots to sustain heat production upon certain conditions, and it is becoming clear that adipose tissue depots can switch phenotypes depending on cell autonomous and non-autonomous stimuli. To maintain such degree of plasticity and respond adequately to changes in the energy balance, three basic processes need to be properly functioning in the adipose tissue: i) adipogenesis and adipocyte turnover, ii) metabolism, and iii) signaling. Here we review the fundamental role of small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) in these processes, with focus on microRNAs, and demonstrate their importance in adipose tissue function and whole body metabolic control in mammals.",

The reasons for adipose tissue dysfunction are incompletely understood, but one potential contributing factor is adipose tissue mitochondrial dysfunction. Derangements of adipose tissue mitochondrial biogenesis and pathways associate with obesity and metabolic diseases. Mitochondria are central organelles in energy metabolism through their role in energy derivation through catabolic oxidative reactions. The mitochondrial processes are dependent on the proper NAD+/NADH redox balance and NAD+ is essential for reactions catalyzed by the key regulators of mitochondrial metabolism, sirtuins (SIRTs) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). Notably, obesity is associated with disturbed adipose tissue NAD+ homeostasis and the balance of SIRT and PARP activities. In this review we aim to summarize existing literature on the maintenance of intracellular NAD+ pools and the function of SIRTs and PARPs in adipose tissue during normal and obese conditions, with the purpose of comprehending their potential role in mitochondrial derangements and obesity associated metabolic complications. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that are the root cause of the adipose tissue mitochondrial derangements is crucial for developing new effective strategies to reverse obesity associated metabolic complications.",

Changes in the oxygen content in utero caused by conditions such as pre-eclampsia or type I diabetes or by oxygen supplementation to the mother lead to increased free radical production and correlate with perinatal outcomes.In the fetal-to-neonatal transition asphyxia is characterized by intermittent periods of hypoxia ischemia that may evolve to hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy associated with neurocognitive, motor, and neurosensorial impairment. Free radicals generated upon reoxygenation may notably increase brain damage. Hence, clinical trials have shown that the use of 100% oxygen given with positive pressure in the airways of the newborn infant during resuscitation causes more oxidative stress than using air, and increases mortality.Preterm infants are endowed with an immature lung and antioxidant system. Clinical stabilization of preterm infants after birth frequently requires positive pressure ventilation with a gas admixture that contains oxygen to achieve a normal heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation. In randomized controlled trials the use high oxygen concentrations (90% to 100%) has caused more oxidative stress and clinical complications that the use of lower oxygen concentrations (30\u201360%). A correlation between the amount of oxygen received during resuscitation and the level of biomarkers of oxidative stress and clinical outcomes was established. Thus, based on clinical outcomes and analytical results of oxidative stress biomarkers relevant changes were introduced in the resuscitation policies. However, it should be underscored that analysis of oxidative stress biomarkers in biofluids has only been used in experimental and clinical research but not in clinical routine. The complexity of the technical procedures, lack of automation, and cost of these determinations have hindered the routine use of biomarkers in the clinical setting. Overcoming these technical and economical difficulties constitutes a challenge for the immediate future since accurate evaluation of oxidative stress would contribute to improve the quality of care of our neonatal patients.",

The main mechanism activated due to exposure of the cell to these reactive species is the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. Although Nrf2 was firstly perceived as a tumor suppressor that inhibits tumor initiation and cancer metastasis, more recent data reveal its role also as a pro-oncogenic factor. Discovery of the upregulation of Nrf2 in different types of cancer supports such undesirable pathophysiological roles of Nrf2. The upregulation of Nrf2 leads to activation of cytoprotective genes thus helping malignant cells to withstand high levels of ROS and to avoid apoptosis, eventually becoming resistant to conventional anticancer therapy. Therefore, new treatment strategies are needed for eradication of cancer and in this review, we will explore two opposing approaches for modulation of Nrf2 in cancer treatments.",

     "abstract": "Activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult humans increase glucose and fatty acid clearance as well as resting metabolic rate, whereas a prolonged elevation of BAT activity improves insulin sensitivity. However, substantial reductions in body weight following BAT activation has not yet been shown in humans. This observation raise the possibility for feedback mechanisms in adult humans in terms of a brown fat-brain crosstalk, possibly mediated by batokines, factors produced by and secreted from brown fat. Batokines also seems to be involved in BAT recruitment by stimulating proliferation and differentiation of brown fat progenitors. Increasing human BAT capacity could thus include inducing brown fat biogenesis as well as identifying novel batokines. Another attractive approach would be to induce a brown fat phenotype, the so-called brite or beige fat, within the white fat depots. In adult humans, white fat tissue transformation into beige has been observed in patients with pheochromocytoma, a norepinephrine-producing tumor. Interestingly, human beige fat is predominantly induced in regions that were BAT during early childhood, possibly reflecting that a presence of human beige progenitors is depot specific and originating from BAT. In conclusion, to utilize the anti-obesity potential of human BAT focus should be directed towards identifying novel regulators of brown and beige fat progenitor cells, as well as feedback mechanisms of BAT activation. This would allow for identification of novel anti-obesity targets.",

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterized by severe ischemic conditions in the periphery leading to intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia (end stage). It is well known that redox biology and oxidative stress play an important role in this setting. We here discuss the major pathways of oxidative stress and redox signaling underlying the disease progression with special emphasis on the contribution of inflammatory processes. We also highlight therapeutic strategies comprising pharmacological (e.g. statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, phosphodiesterase inhibition) and non-pharmacological (e.g. exercise) interventions. Both of these strategies induce potent indirect antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms that may contribute to an improvement of PAD associated complications and disease progression by removing excess formation of ROS and RNS (e.g. by ameliorating primary complications such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension) as well as the normalization of the inflammatory phenotype suppressing the progression of atherosclerosis.",

The most common functional subunits of adipose tissue, white and brown adipocytes, regulate and respond to endocrine processes, which then determine metabolic rate as well as adipose tissue functions. While the molecular aspects of white and brown adipose biology have become clearer in the recent past, much less is known about sex-specific differences in regulation and deposition of adipose tissue, and the specific role of the so-called pink adipocytes during lactation in females. This review summarises the current understanding of adipose tissue dynamics with a focus on sex-specific differences in adipose tissue energy metabolism and endocrine functions, focussing on mammalian model organisms as well as human-derived data. In females, pink adipocytes trans-differentiate during pregnancy from subcutaneous white adipocytes and are responsible for milk-secretion in mammary glands. Overlooking biological sex variation may ultimately hamper clinical treatments of many aspects of metabolic disorders.",

Upon exposure to acute hypoxia, inhibition of K+ channels is the signal that triggers cell depolarization, transmitter release and activation of sensory fibers that stimulate the brainstem respiratory center to produce hyperventilation. The molecular mechanisms underlying O2 sensing by glomus cells have, however, remained elusive. Here we discuss recent data demonstrating that ablation of mitochondrial Ndufs2 gene selectively abolishes sensitivity of glomus cells to hypoxia, maintaining responsiveness to hypercapnia or hypoglycemia. These data suggest that reactive oxygen species and NADH generated in mitochondrial complex I during hypoxia are signaling molecules that modulate membrane K+ channels.

The redox imbalance causes oxidative stress, resulting in lipid peroxidation, and alterations in lipid metabolism and homeostasis. Some lipid classes such as oxidized fatty acids, 4-hydroxyalkenal species, and plasmalogen are sensitive to oxidative stress or generated corresponding to redox imbalance.

This review focuses on the advances of MDMS-SL in analysis of these lipid classes and molecular species, and summarizes their recent representative applications in biomedical/biological research.

Genetic modulation of the enzymatic source of oxidants or components of the antioxidant system reveal that physiological levels of oxidants are essential to promote the process of arteriogenesis and angiogenesis after femoral artery occlusion, although mice with diabetes or atherosclerosis may have higher deleterious levels of oxidants. Therefore, fine control of oxidants is required to stimulate vascularization in the limb muscle. Oxidants transduce cellular signaling through oxidative modifications of redox sensitive cysteine thiols. Of particular importance, the reversible modification with abundant glutathione, called S-glutathionylation (or GSH adducts), is relatively stable and alters protein function including signaling, transcription, and cytoskeletal arrangement. Glutaredoxin-1 (Glrx) is an enzyme which catalyzes reversal of GSH adducts, and does not scavenge oxidants itself. Glrx may control redox signaling under fluctuation of oxidants levels. In ischemic muscle increased GSH adducts through Glrx deletion improves in vivo limb revascularization, indicating endogenous Glrx has anti-angiogenic roles. In accordance, Glrx overexpression attenuates VEGF signaling in vitro and ischemic vascularization in vivo. There are several Glrx targets including HIF-1\u03b1 which may contribute to inhibition of vascularization by reducing GSH adducts. These animal studies provide a caution that excess antioxidants may be counter-productive for treatment of ischemic limbs, and highlights Glrx as a potential therapeutic target to improve ischemic limb vascularization.",

The most successful intervention for the treatment of moderate to severe HIE is moderate whole body hypothermia initiated within 6\u00a0h from birth. The objective and prompt identification of infants who are at risk of developing moderate to severe HIE in the critical first hours still remains a challenge. This work proposes a metabolite score calculated based on the relative intensities of three metabolites (choline, 6,8-dihydroxypurine and hypoxanthine) that showed maximum correlation with hypoxia time in a consolidated piglet model for neonatal hypoxia-ischemia. The metabolite score's performance as a biomarker for perinatal hypoxia and its usefulness for clinical grading and decision making have been assessed and compared to the performance of lactate which is currently considered the gold standard. For plasma samples withdrawn before and directly after a hypoxic insult, the metabolite score performed similar to lactate. However, it provided an enhanced predictive capacity at 2\u00a0h after resuscitation. The present study evidences the usefulness of the metabolite score for improving the early assessment of the severity of the hypoxic insult based on serial determinations in a minimally invasive biofluid. The applicability of the metabolite score for clinical diagnosis and patient stratification for hypothermia treatment has to be confirmed in multicenter trials involving newborns suffering from HIE.",

Ferroptosis, a newly identified oxidative cell death mechanism triggered by massive lipid peroxidation, is implicated in the degeneration of neurons populations such as spinal motor neurons and midbrain neurons. Here, we investigated whether neurons in forebrain regions (cerebral cortex and hippocampus) that are severely afflicted in AD patients might be vulnerable to ferroptosis. To this end, we generated Gpx4BIKO mouse, a mouse model with conditional deletion in forebrain neurons of glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4), a key regulator of ferroptosis, and showed that treatment with tamoxifen led to deletion of Gpx4 primarily in forebrain neurons of adult Gpx4BIKO mice. Starting at 12 weeks after tamoxifen treatment, Gpx4BIKO mice exhibited significant deficits in spatial learning and memory function versus Control mice as determined by the Morris water maze task. Further examinations revealed that the cognitively impaired Gpx4BIKO mice exhibited hippocampal neurodegeneration. Notably, markers associated with ferroptosis, such as elevated lipid peroxidation, ERK activation and augmented neuroinflammation, were observed in Gpx4BIKO mice. We also showed that Gpx4BIKO mice fed a diet deficient in vitamin E, a lipid soluble antioxidant with anti-ferroptosis activity, had an expedited rate of hippocampal neurodegeneration and behavior dysfunction, and that treatment with a small-molecule ferroptosis inhibitor ameliorated neurodegeneration in those mice. Taken together, our results indicate that forebrain neurons are susceptible to ferroptosis, suggesting that ferroptosis may be an important neurodegenerative mechanism in diseases such as AD.",

An increase in HIF-1\u03b1, NOX-4, HO-1, iNOS, CBS and CSE expression was observed only in unstable plaques. 78% of patients under simvastatin were diagnosed with stable plaques whereas 23% of those not receiving simvastatin exhibited unstable plaques. Simvastatin decreased iNOS, HO-1, HIF-1\u03b1 and CSE whilst it increased eNOS phosphorylation. In conclusion, enhanced eNOS and reduced iNOS and NOX-4 were observed in stable plaques; CBS and CSE positively correlated with plaque vulnerability. Simvastatin, besides its known effect on eNOS upregulation, reduced the HIF-1\u03b1 and its downstream targets. The observed changes might be useful in developing biomarkers of plaque stability or could be targets for pharmacothepary against plaque vulnerability.",

     "abstract": "Most of the in vitro studies using liver cell lines have been performed under atmospheric oxygen partial pressure (21% O2). However, the oxygen concentrations in the liver and cancer cells are far from this value. In the present study, we have evaluated the influence of oxygen on 1) the tumor cell lines features (growth, steady-state ROS levels, GSH content, activities of antioxidant enzymes, p66 Shc and SOD expressions, metalloproteinases secretion, migration, invasion, and adhesion) of human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, and b) the response of the cells to an oxidant stimulus (aqueous leaf extract of the V. baccifera plant species). For this purpose, three hepatocarcinoma cell lines with different p53 status, HepG2 (wild-type), Huh7 (mutated), and Hep3B (deleted), were cultured (6\u201330 days) under atmospheric (21%) and more physiological (8%) pO2. Results showed that after long-term culturing at 8% versus 21% O2, the cellular proliferation rate and the steady-state levels of mitochondrial O2- were unaffected. However, the intracellular basal ROS levels were higher independently of the characteristics of the cell line. Moreover, the lower pO2 was associated with lower glutathione content, the induction of p66 Shc and Mn-SOD proteins, and increased SOD activity only in HepG2. This cell line also showed a higher migration rate, secretion of active metalloproteinases, and a faster invasion. HepG2 cells were more resistant to the oxidative stress induced by V. baccifera. Results suggest that the long-term culturing of human hepatoma cells at a low, more physiological pO2 induces antioxidant adaptations that could be mediated by p53, and may alter the cellular response to a subsequent oxidant challenge. Data support the necessity of validating outcomes from studies performed with hepatoma cell cultures under ambient O2.",

Upon hemolysis and when free in circulation, Hb can be involved in a range of radical generating reactions and may thereby attack several different biomolecules. In this study, we have examined the potential damaging effects of cell-free Hb on plasmid DNA (pDNA). Hb induced cleavage of supercoiled pDNA (sc pDNA) which was proportional to the concentration of Hb applied. Almost 70% of sc pDNA was converted to open circular or linear DNA using 10\u00a0\u00b5M of Hb in 12\u00a0h. Hb can be present in several different forms. The oxy (HbO2) and met forms are most reactive, while the carboxy-protein shows only low hydrolytic activity. Hemoglobin A (HbA) could easily induce complete pDNA cleavage while fetal hemoglobin (HbF) was three-fold less reactive. By inserting, a redox active cysteine residue on the surface of the alpha chain of HbF by site-directed mutagenesis, the DNA cleavage reaction was enhanced by 82%. Reactive oxygen species were not directly involved in the reaction since addition of superoxide dismutase and catalase did not prevent pDNA cleavage. The reactivity of Hb with pDNA can rather be associated with the formation of protein based radicals.",

Importantly, giving MnTnBuOE-2-PyP5+(MnP), a redox- active MnSOD mimetic, to mouse primary bone marrow cells or to C57B/L6 mice significantly enhances the number of HSPCs.

Its use has been associated with ROS generation and neurotoxicity. Physiological and metabolomic alterations, and genetics leading to the clinically observed adverse effects have not been temporally characterized. To study alterations that may lead to these undesirable effects, Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown on aerobic carbon sources to stationary phase was assessed over 6\u00a0h. Exposure of an LC50 dose of lidocaine, increased mitochondrial depolarization and ROS/RNS generation assessed using JC-1, ROS/RNS specific probes, and FACS. Intracellular calcium also increased, assessed by ICP-MS. Measurement of the relative ATP and ADP concentrations indicates an initial 3-fold depletion of ATP suggesting an alteration in the ATP:ADP ratio. At the 6\u00a0h time point the lidocaine exposed population contained ATP concentrations roughly 85% that of the negative control suggesting the surviving population adapted its metabolic pathways to, at least partially restore cellular bioenergetics. Metabolite analysis indicates an increase of intermediates in the pentose phosphate pathway, the preparatory phase of glycolysis, and NADPH. Oxidative stress produced by lidocaine exposure targets aconitase decreasing its activity with an observed decrease in isocitrate and an increase citrate. Similarly, increases in \u03b1-ketoglutarate, malate, and oxaloacetate imply activation of anaplerotic reactions. Antioxidant molecule glutathione and its precursor amino acids, cysteine and glutamate were greatly increased at later time points. Phosphatidylserine externalization suggestive of early phase apoptosis was also observed. Genetic studies using metacaspase null strains showed resistance to lidocaine induced cell death. These data suggest lidocaine induces perpetual mitochondrial depolarization, ROS/RNS generation along with increased glutathione to combat the oxidative cellular environment, glycolytic to PPP cycling of carbon generating NADPH, obstruction of carbon flow through the TCA cycle, decreased ATP generation, and metacaspase dependent apoptotic cell death.",

Intracellular DNA damage, detected by \u03b3H2AX and the COMET assay, however, is not linked to direct Mn-Oda free radical generation, but is instead mediated through the promotion of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to autophagic vacuole formation and downstream nuclear degradation. To elucidate the cytotoxic profile of Mn-Oda, a wide range of biomarkers specific to apoptosis and autophagy including caspase release, mitochondrial membrane integrity, fluorogenic probe localisation, and cell cycle analysis were employed. Through these techniques, the activity of Mn-Oda was compared directly to i.) the pro-apoptotic clinical anticancer drug doxorubicin, ii.) the multimodal histone deacetylase inhibitor suberoyanilide hydroxamic acid, and iii.) the autophagy inducer rapamycin.

     "abstract": "Astrogliosis has long been recognized in Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. However, the mechanisms of how astroglia become activated remain unclear. Reciprocal interactions between microglia and astroglia play a pivotal role in regulating the activities of astroglia. The purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism by which microglia regulate astrogliosis by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse PD models. We found that the activation of microglia preceded astroglia in the substantia nigra of mice treated with either LPS or MPTP. Furthermore, suppression of microglial activation by pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of NADPH oxidase (NOX2) in mice attenuated astrogliosis. The important role of NOX2 in microglial regulation of astrogliosis was further mirrored in a mixed-glia culture system. Mechanistically, H2O2, a product of microglial NOX2 activation, serves as a direct signal to regulate astrogliosis. Astrogliosis was induced by H2O2 through a process in which extracellularly generated H2O2 diffused into the cytoplasm and subsequently stimulated activation of transcription factors, STAT1 and STAT3. STAT1/3 activation regulated the immunological functions of H2O2-induced astrogliosis since AG490, an inhibitor of STAT1/3, attenuated the gene expressions of both proinflammatory and neurotrophic factors in H2O2-treated astrocyte. Our findings indicate that microglial NOX2-generated H2O2 is able to regulate the immunological functions of astroglia via a STAT1/3-dependent manner, providing additional evidence for the immune pathogenesis and therapeutic studies of PD.",

     "abstract": "Pepper fruit is one of the highest vitamin C sources of plant origin for our diet. In plants, ascorbic acid is mainly synthesized through the L-galactose pathway, being the L-galactono-1,4-lactone dehydrogenase (GalLDH) the last step. Using pepper fruits, the full GalLDH gene was cloned and the protein molecular characterization accomplished. GalLDH protein sequence (586 residues) showed a 37 amino acids signal peptide at the N-terminus, characteristic of mitochondria. The hydrophobic analysis of the mature protein displayed one transmembrane helix comprising 20 amino acids at the N-terminus. By using a polyclonal antibody raised against a GalLDH internal sequence and immunoblotting analysis, a 56\u00a0kDa polypeptide cross-reacted with pepper fruit samples. Using leaves, flowers, stems and fruits, the expression of GalLDH by qRT-PCR and the enzyme activity were analyzed, and results indicate that GalLDH is a key player in the physiology of pepper plants, being possibly involved in the processes which undertake the transport of ascorbate among different organs.We also report that an NO (nitric oxide)-enriched atmosphere enhanced ascorbate content in pepper fruits about 40% parallel to increased GalLDH gene expression and enzyme activity. This is the first report on the stimulating effect of NO treatment on the vitamin C concentration in plants. Accordingly, the modulation by NO of GalLDH was addressed. In vitro enzymatic assays of GalLDH were performed in the presence of SIN-1 (peroxynitrite donor) and S-nitrosoglutahione (NO donor). Combined results of in vivo NO treatment and in vitro assays showed that NO provoked the regulation of GalLDH at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, but not post-translational modifications through nitration or S-nitrosylation events promoted by reactive nitrogen species (RNS) took place. These results suggest that this modulation point of the ascorbate biosynthesis could be potentially used for biotechnological purposes to increase the vitamin C levels in pepper fruits.",

Alkynyl lanosterol (a-Lan) was synthesized and studied in Neuro2a cells, Dhcr7-deficient Neuro2a cells and human fibroblasts.

In parallel experiments with a-Lan and a-7-DHC in Dhcr7-deficient Neuro2a cells, a-7-DHC was found to adduct to a larger set of proteins (799) than a-Lan (457) with most of the a-Lan protein adducts (423) being common to the larger a-7-DHC set. Of the 423 proteins found common to both experiments, those formed from a-7-DHC were more highly enriched compared to a DMSO control than were those derived from a-Lan.

     "abstract": "The diverse responses of different cancers to treatments such as photodynamic therapy of cancer (PDT) have fueled a growing need for reliable predictive markers for treatment outcome. In the present work we have studied the differential response of two phenotypically and genotypically different breast adenocarcinoma cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB-231, to hypericin PDT (HYP-PDT). MDA-MB-231 cells were 70% more sensitive to HYP PDT than MCF7 cells at LD50. MCF7 were found to express a substantially higher level of glutathione peroxidase (GPX4) than MDA-MB-231, while MDA-MB-231 differentially expressed glutathione-S-transferase (GSTP1), mainly used for xenobiotic detoxification. Eighty % reduction of intracellular glutathione (GSH) by buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), largely enhanced the sensitivity of the GSTP1 expressing MDA-MB-231 cells to HYP-PDT, but not in MCF7 cells. Further inhibition of the GSH reduction however by carmustine (BCNU) resulted in an enhanced sensitivity of MCF7 to HYP-PDT. HYP loading studies suggested that HYP can be a substrate of GSTP for GSH conjugation as BSO enhanced the cellular HYP accumulation by 20% in MDA-MB-231 cells, but not in MCF7 cells. Studies in solutions showed that L-cysteine can bind the GSTP substrate CDNB in the absence of GSTP. This means that the GSTP-lacking MCF7 may use L-cysteine for xenobiotic detoxification, especially during GSH synthesis inhibition, which leads to L-cysteine build-up. This was confirmed by the lowered accumulation of HYP in both cell lines in the presence of BSO and the L-cysteine source NAC. NAC reduced the sensitivity of MCF7, but not MDA-MB-231, cells to HYP PDT which is in accordance with the antioxidant effects of L-cysteine and its potential as a GSTP substrate. As a conclusion we have herein shown that the different GSH based cell defense mechanisms can be utilized as predictive markers for the outcome of PDT and as a guide for selecting optimal combination strategies.",

We further examined the molecular mechanisms and found that physapubescin B enhanced the autophagic flux through promotion of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated suppression of mammalian target of rapamycin complex I (mTORC1), the key negative regulator of autophagy. Additionally, excessive ROS caused by physapubescin B also induced p53-dependent apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, we provided evidence that inhibition of autophagy either by a chemical inhibitor or gene silencing promoted physapubescin B-induced apoptotic cell death, indicating that autophagy serves as a cell survival mechanism to protect cell death. Thus, our data provide a clue that inhibition of autophagy would serve as a novel strategy for enhancing the anti-cancer potential of physapubescin B.",

     "abstract": "Acute hypoxia increases the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the brain. However, the effect of reoxygenation, unavoidable to achieve full recovery of the hypoxic organ, has not been clearly established. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of exposition to acute severe respiratory hypoxia followed by reoxygenation on the evolution of oxidative stress and apoptosis in the brain. We investigated the effect of in vivo acute severe normobaric hypoxia (rats exposed to 7% O2 for 6\u00a0h) and reoxygenation in normoxia (21% O2 for 24\u00a0h or 48\u00a0h) on oxidative stress markers, the antioxidant system and apoptosis in the brain. After respiratory hypoxia we found increased levels of HIF-1\u03b1 expression, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and nitric oxide in brain extracts. Antioxidant defence systems such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and the reduced/oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) ratio were significantly decreased in the brain. After 24\u00a0h of reoxygenation, oxidative stress parameters and the anti-oxidant system returned to control values. Regarding the apoptosis parameters, acute hypoxia increased cytochrome c, AIF and caspase 3 activity in the brain. The apoptotic effect is greatest after 24\u00a0h of reoxygenation. Immunohistochemistry suggests that CA3 and dentate gyrus in the hippocampus seem more susceptible to hypoxia than the cortex. Severe acute hypoxia increases oxidative damage, which in turn could activate apoptotic mechanisms. Our work is the first to demonstrate that after 24\u00a0h of reoxygenation oxidative stress is attenuated, while apoptosis is maintained mainly in the hippocampus, which may, in fact, be the cause of impaired brain function.",

Our previous study demonstrated that VPO1 plays a critical role in endothelial dysfunction through dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase2 (DDAH2)/asymmetric Dimethylarginine (ADMA) pathway. Hereby we describe the regulatory role of VPO1 on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression and activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In HUVECs AngiotensinII (100\u00a0nM) treatment reduced Nitric Oxide (NO) production, decreased eNOS expression and activity, which were reversed by VPO1 siRNA. Knockdown of VPO1 also attenuated ADMA production and eNOS uncoupling while enhancing phosphorylated ser1177 eNOS expression level. Furthermore, HOCl stimulation was shown to directly induce ADMA production and eNOS uncoupling, decrease phosphorylated ser1177 eNOS expression. It also significantly suppressed eNOS expression and activity together with NO production. Therefore, VPO1 plays a vital role in regulating eNOS expression and activity via hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-VPO1-HOCl pathway.",

     "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a key signaling agent. Its best characterized signaling actions in mammalian cells involve the early oxidation of thiols in cytoplasmic phosphatases, kinases and transcription factors. However, these redox targets are orders of magnitude less H2O2-reactive and abundant than cytoplasmic peroxiredoxins. How can they be oxidized in a signaling time frame? Here we investigate this question using computational reaction-diffusion models of H2O2 signaling. The results show that at H2O2 supply rates commensurate with mitogenic signaling a H2O2 concentration gradient with a length scale of a few tenths of \u03bcm is established. Even near the supply sites H2O2 concentrations are far too low to oxidize typical targets in an early mitogenic signaling time frame. Furthermore, any inhibition of the peroxiredoxin or increase in H2O2 supply able to drastically increase the local H2O2 concentration would collapse the concentration gradient and/or cause an extensive oxidation of the peroxiredoxins I and II, inconsistent with experimental observations. In turn, the local concentrations of peroxiredoxin sulfenate and disulfide forms exceed those of H2O2 by several orders of magnitude. Redox targets reacting with these forms at rate constants much lower than that for, say, thioredoxin could be oxidized within seconds. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the concentrations of these peroxiredoxin forms allows them to reach targets within 1 \u03bcm from the H2O2 sites while maintaining signaling localized. The recruitment of peroxiredoxins to specific sites such as caveolae can dramatically increase the local concentrations of the sulfenic and disulfide forms, thus further helping these species to outcompete H2O2 for the oxidation of redox targets. Altogether, these results suggest that H2O2 signaling is mediated by localized redox relays whereby peroxiredoxins are oxidized to sulfenate and disulfide forms at H2O2 supply sites and these forms in turn oxidize the redox targets near these sites.",

     "abstract": "Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a group of compounds found in various plants and some of them are widely consumed in the world as herbal medicines and food supplements. PAs are potent hepatotoxins that cause irreversible liver injury in animals and humans. However, the mechanisms by which PAs induce liver injury are not clear. In the present study, we determined the hepatotoxicity and molecular mechanisms of senecionine, one of the most common toxic PAs, in primary cultured mouse and human hepatocytes as well as in mice. We found that senecionine administration increased serum alanine aminotransferase levels in mice. H&E and TUNEL staining of liver tissues revealed increased hemorrhage and hepatocyte apoptosis in liver zone 2 areas. Mechanistically, senecionine induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c as well as mitochondrial JNK translocation and activation prior to the increased DNA fragmentation and caspase-3 activation in primary cultured mouse and human hepatocytes. SP600125, a specific JNK inhibitor, and ZVAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor, alleviated senecionine-induced apoptosis in primary hepatocytes. Interestingly, senecionine also caused marked mitochondria fragmentation in hepatocytes. Pharmacological inhibition of dynamin-related protein1 (Drp1), a protein that is critical to regulate mitochondrial fission, blocked senecionine-induced mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial release of cytochrome c and apoptosis. More importantly, hepatocyte-specific Drp1 knockout mice were resistant to senecionine-induced liver injury due to decreased mitochondrial damage and apoptosis. In conclusion, our results uncovered a novel mechanism of Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation in senecionine-induced liver injury. Targeting Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis may be a potential avenue to prevent and treat hepatotoxicity induced by PAs.",

Down-regulation of MLN64 in Niemann-Pick C1 deficient cells decreased mitochondrial cholesterol content, suggesting that MLN64 functions independently of NPC1. However, the role of MLN64 in the maintenance of endosomal cholesterol flow and intracellular cholesterol homeostasis remains unclear. We have previously described that hepatic MLN64 overexpression increases liver cholesterol content and induces liver damage. Here, we studied the function of MLN64 in normal and NPC1-deficient cells and we evaluated whether MLN64 overexpressing cells exhibit alterations in mitochondrial function. We used recombinant-adenovirus-mediated MLN64 gene transfer to overexpress MLN64 in mouse liver and hepatic cells; and RNA interference to down-regulate MLN64 in NPC1-deficient cells. In MLN64-overexpressing cells, we found increased mitochondrial cholesterol content and decreased glutathione (GSH) levels and ATPase activity. Furthermore, we found decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial fragmentation and increased mitochondrial superoxide levels in MLN64-overexpressing cells and in NPC1-deficient cells. Consequently, MLN64 expression was increased in NPC1-deficient cells and reduction of its expression restore mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial superoxide levels. Our findings suggest that MLN64 overexpression induces an increase in mitochondrial cholesterol content and consequently a decrease in mitochondrial GSH content leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. In addition, we demonstrate that MLN64 expression is increased in NPC cells and plays a key role in cholesterol transport into the mitochondria.",

     "abstract": "Nitrite and nitrate restore deficient endogenous nitric oxide (NO) production as they are converted back to NO, and therefore complement the classic enzymatic NO synthesis. Circulating nitrate and nitrite must cross membrane barriers to produce their effects and increased nitrate concentrations may attenuate the nitrite influx into cells, decreasing NO generation from nitrite. Moreover, xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) mediates NO formation from nitrite and nitrate. However, no study has examined whether nitrate attenuates XOR-mediated NO generation from nitrite. We hypothesized that nitrate attenuates the vascular and blood pressure responses to nitrite either by interfering with nitrite influx into vascular tissue, or by competing with nitrite for XOR, thus inhibiting XOR-mediated NO generation. We used two independent vascular function assays in rats (aortic ring preparations and isolated mesenteric arterial bed perfusion) to examine the effects of sodium nitrate on the concentration-dependent responses to sodium nitrite. Both assays showed that nitrate attenuated the vascular responses to nitrite. Conversely, the aortic responses to the NO donor DETANONOate were not affected by sodium nitrate. Further confirming these results, we found that nitrate attenuated the acute blood pressure lowering effects of increasing doses of nitrite infused intravenously in freely moving rats. The possibility that nitrate could compete with nitrite and decrease nitrite influx into cells was tested by measuring the accumulation of nitrogen-15-labeled nitrite (15N-nitrite) by aortic rings using ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Nitrate exerted no effect on aortic accumulation of 15N-nitrite. Next, we used chemiluminescence-based NO detection to examine whether nitrate attenuates XOR-mediated nitrite reductase activity. Nitrate significantly shifted the Michaelis Menten saturation curve to the right, with a 3-fold increase in the Michaelis constant. Together, our results show that nitrate inhibits XOR-mediated NO production from nitrite, and this mechanism may explain how nitrate attenuates the vascular and blood pressure responses to nitrite.",

Moreover, PCB-153 concentration-dependently inhibited insulin-dependent glucose uptake and lipid accumulation in cultured hepatocytes and adipocytes.

Xanthohumol (Xn), a principal prenylflavonoid, possesses anti-inflammation and anti-oxidant activities. However, whether Xn could protect from LPS-induced ALI through inducing AMPK/Nrf2 activation and its downstream signals, are still poorly elucidated. Accordingly, we focused on exploring the protective effect of Xn in the context of ALI and the involvement of underlying molecular mechanisms. Our findings indicated that Xn effectively alleviated lung injury by reduction of lung W/D ratio and protein levels, neutrophil infiltration, MDA and MPO formation, and SOD and GSH depletion. Meanwhile, Xn significantly lessened histopathological changes, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, several cytokines secretion, and iNOS and HMGB1 expression, and inhibited Txnip/NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway activation. Additionally, Xn evidently decreased t-BHP-stimulated cell apoptosis, ROS generation and GSH depletion but increased various anti-oxidative enzymes expression regulated by Keap1-Nrf2/ARE activation, which may be associated with AMPK and GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation. However, Xn-mediated inflammatory cytokines and ROS production, histopathological changes, Txnip/NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in WT mice were remarkably abrogated in Nrf2-/- mice. Our experimental results firstly provided a support that Xn effectively protected LPS-induced ALI against oxidative stress and inflammation damage which are largely dependent upon upregulation of the Nrf2 pathway via activation of AMPK/GSK3\u03b2, thereby suppressing LPS-activated Txnip/NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

     "abstract": "Catalase is well-known as an antioxidant dismutating H2O2 to O2 and H2O. However, catalases evolved when metabolism was largely sulfur-based, long before O2 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) became abundant, suggesting catalase metabolizes reactive sulfide species (RSS). Here we examine catalase metabolism of H2Sn, the sulfur analog of H2O2, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and other sulfur-bearing molecules using H2S-specific amperometric electrodes and fluorophores to measure polysulfides (H2Sn; SSP4) and ROS (dichlorofluorescein, DCF). Catalase eliminated H2Sn, but did not anaerobically generate H2S, the expected product of dismutation. Instead, catalase concentration- and oxygen-dependently metabolized H2S and in so doing acted as a sulfide oxidase with a P50 of 20\u00a0mmHg. H2O2 had little effect on catalase-mediated H2S metabolism but in the presence of the catalase inhibitor, sodium azide (Az), H2O2 rapidly and efficiently expedited H2S metabolism in both normoxia and hypoxia suggesting H2O2 is an effective electron acceptor in this reaction. Unexpectedly, catalase concentration-dependently generated H2S from dithiothreitol (DTT) in both normoxia and hypoxia, concomitantly oxidizing H2S in the presence of O2. H2S production from DTT was inhibited by carbon monoxide and augmented by NADPH suggesting that catalase heme-iron is the catalytic site and that NADPH provides reducing equivalents. Catalase also generated H2S from garlic oil, diallyltrisulfide, thioredoxin and sulfur dioxide, but not from sulfite, metabisulfite, carbonyl sulfide, cysteine, cystine, glutathione or oxidized glutathione. Oxidase activity was also present in catalase from Aspergillus niger. These results show that catalase can act as either a sulfide oxidase or sulfur reductase and they suggest that these activities likely played a prominent role in sulfur metabolism during evolution and may continue do so in modern cells as well. This also appears to be the first observation of catalase reductase activity independent of peroxide dismutation.",

In this study, the role of miR-22 in butyrate-mediated ROS release and induction of apoptosis was determined in hepatic cells. Intracellular expression of miR-22 was increased when the Huh 7 cells were incubated with sodium butyrate. Over-expression of miR-22 or addition of sodium butyrate inhibited SIRT-1 expression and enhanced the ROS production. Incubation of cells with anti-miR-22 reversed the effects of butyrate. Butyrate induced apoptosis via ROS production, cytochrome c release and activation of caspase-3, whereas addition of N-acetyl cysteine or anti-miR-22 reversed these butyrate-induced effects. Furthermore, sodium butyrate inhibited cell growth and proliferation, whereas anti-miR-22 inhibited these butyrate-mediated changes.

The cysteine biosynthesis pathway of Leishmania may serve as a potential drug target because it is different from human host and regulates downstream components of redox metabolism of the parasites; essential for their survival, pathogenicity and drug resistance. However, despite the apparent dependency of redox metabolism of cysteine biosynthesis pathway, the role of L. donovani cysteine synthase (LdCS) in drug resistance and redox homeostasis has been unexplored. Herein, we report that over-expression of LdCS in Amphotericin B (Amp B) sensitive strain (S1-OE) modulates resistance towards oxidative stress and drug pressure. We observed that antioxidant enzyme activities were up-regulated in S1-OE parasites and these parasites alleviate intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) efficiently by maintaining the reduced thiol pool. In contrast to S1-OE parasites, Amp B sensitive strain (S1) showed higher levels of ROS which was positively correlated with the protein carbonylation levels and negatively correlated with cell viability. Moreover, further investigations showed that LdCS over-expression also augments the ROS-primed induction of LdCS-GFP as well as endogenous LdCS and thiol pathway proteins (LdTryS, LdTryR and LdcTXN) in L. donovani parasites; which probably aids in stress tolerance and drug resistance. In addition, the expression of LdCS was found to be up-regulated in Amp B resistant isolates and during infective stationary stages of growth and consistent with these observations, our ex vivo infectivity studies confirmed that LdCS over-expression enhances the infectivity of L. donovani parasites.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects and underlying mechanisms of carbon monoxide releasing molecule-2 (CORM-2) on Ang II-induced MMP-9 expression and cell migration of HASMCs. Ang II significantly up-regulated MMP-9 expression and cell migration of HASMCs, which was inhibited by transfection with siRNA of p47phox, Nox2, Nox4, p65, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and pretreatment with the inhibitors of NADPH oxidase, ROS, and NF-\u03baB. In addition, Ang II also induced NADPH oxidase/ROS generation and p47phox translocation from the cytosol to the membrane. Moreover, Ang II-induced oxidative stress and MMP-9-dependent cell migration were inhibited by pretreatment with CORM-2. Finally, we observed that Ang II induced IL-6 release in HASMCs via AT1R, but not AT2R, which could further caused MMP-9 secretion and cell migration. Pretreatment with CORM-2 reduced Ang II-induced IL-6 release. In conclusion, CORM-2 inhibits Ang II-induced HASMCs migration through inactivation of suppression of NADPH oxidase/ROS generation, NF-\u03baB inactivation and IL-6/MMP-9 expression. Thus, application of CO, especially CORM-2, is a potential countermeasure to reverse the pathological changes of various cardiovascular diseases. Further effects aimed at identifying novel antioxidant and anti-inflammatory substances protective for heart and blood vessels that targeting CO and establishment of well-designed in vivo models properly evaluating the efficacy of these agents are needed.",

As compared with normal weight subjects matched in age, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMc) of obese patients present a significant reduction of the antioxidant enzyme activities superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as well as a significant increase of the oxidized/reduced glutathione ratio (GSSG/GSH) in these cells. Lipid peroxidation is significantly increased in the patient group as shown by the increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) in PBMc and the amount of F2-Isoprostanes (F2-IsoPs) released in urine. In addition, the DNA damage product 8-oxo-7,8-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) was also observed to be increased in serum and urine of morbid obese patients as compared with the control group. After LSG, an improvement of their ponderal and metabolic profile was accompanied by a progressive recovery of antioxidant enzyme activities and the decline of oxidative byproducts both in PBMc and biological fluids. The observed changes of urinary 8-oxo-dG levels correlate positively with its serum concentration, the lipid peroxidation products MDA and F2-IsoPs, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, HOMA index and body weight and negatively with the percentage of weight and BMI loss and antioxidant activities. We conclude that the analysis of urinary 8-oxo-dG could be validated as a useful marker for the monitoring of ponderal and metabolic status of morbid obese patients.",

The knowledge of how such processes are regulated in 3D spheroids, being well-established tumor models, is limited. To approach this question we stably transfected HCT116 cells with a pTRAF reporter that enabled time- and cell-resolved activity monitoring of three redox-regulated transcription factors Nrf2, HIF and NF-\u03baB in spheroids enriched for cancer stem cells. At the first day of spheroid formation, these transcription factors were activated and thereafter became repressed. After about a week, both HIF and Nrf2 were reactivated within the spheroid cores. Further amplifying HIF activation in spheroids by treatment with DMOG resulted in a dominant quiescent stem-cell-like phenotype, with high resistance to stress-inducing treatments. Auranofin, triggering oxidative stress and Nrf2 activation, had opposite effects with increased differentiation and proliferation. These novel high-resolution insights into spatiotemporal activation patterns demonstrate a striking coordination of redox regulated transcription factors within spheroids not occurring in conventional cell culture models.",

     "abstract": "Tau protein inclusions are a frequent hallmark of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders. The 10+16 intronic mutation in MAPT gene, encoding tau, causes frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), by altering the splicing of the gene and inducing an increase in the production of 4R tau isoforms, which are more prone to aggregation. However, the molecular mechanisms linking increased 4R tau to neurodegeneration are not well understood.Here, we have used iPSC-derived neurons from patients of FTDP-17 carrying the 10+16 mutation to study the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration.We show that mitochondrial function is altered in the neurons of the patients. We found that FTDP-17 neurons present an increased mitochondrial membrane potential, which is partially maintained by the F1Fo ATPase working in reverse mode. The 10+16 MAPT mutation is also associated with lower mitochondrial NADH levels, partially supressed complex I-driven respiration, and lower ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation, with cells relying on glycolysis to maintain ATP levels. Increased mitochondrial membrane potential in FTDP-17 neurons leads to overproduction of the ROS in mitochondria, which in turn causes oxidative stress and cell death. Mitochondrial ROS overproduction in these cells is a major trigger for neuronal cell death and can be prevented by mitochondrial antioxidants",

Although the \u201coxidation-inflammation\u201d theory of aging proposes that phagocytes are the main immune cells contributing to \u201coxi-inflamm-aging\u201d, this idea has not been corroborated. The aim of this work was to characterize the age-related changes in several parameters of oxidative stress and immune function, as well as in lipofuscin accumulation (\u201ca hallmark of aging\u201d), in both total peritoneal leukocyte population and isolated peritoneal macrophages. Adult, mature, old and long-lived mice (7, 13, 18 and 30 months of age, respectively) were used. The xanthine oxidase (XO) activity-expression, basal levels of superoxide anion and ROS, catalase activity, oxidized (GSSG) and reduced (GSH) glutathione content and lipofuscin levels, as well as both phagocytosis and digestion capacity were evaluated. The results showed an age-related increase of oxidative stress and lipofuscin accumulation in murine peritoneal leukocytes, but especially in macrophages. Macrophages from old mice showed lower antioxidant defenses (catalase activity and GSH levels), higher oxidizing compounds (XO activity/expression and superoxide, ROS and GSSG levels) and lipofuscin levels, together with an impaired macrophage functions, in comparison to adults. In contrast, long-lived mice showed in their peritoneal leukocytes, and especially in macrophages, a well-preserved redox state and maintenance of their immune functions, all which could account for their high longevity. Interestingly, macrophages showed higher XO activity and lipofuscin accumulation than lymphocytes in all the ages analyzed. Our results support that macrophages play a central role in the chronic oxidative stress associated with aging, and the fact that phagocytes are key cells contributing to immunosenescence and \u201coxi-inflamm-aging\u201d. Moreover, the determination of oxidative stress and immune function parameters, together with the lipofuscin quantification, in macrophages, can be used as useful markers of the rate of aging and longevity.",

To explore the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of resolvins, we have studied the effects of resolvin D1 (RvD1) on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endothelial barrier disruption as it is linked to propagation of inflammation. We found that LPS induces endothelial cell (EC) barrier disruption via xanthine oxidase (XO)-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 inactivation and Fyn-related kinase (Frk) activation leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of \u03b1-catenin and VE-cadherin and their dissociation from each other affecting adherens junction (AJ) integrity and thereby increasing endothelial barrier permeability. RvD1 attenuated LPS-induced AJ disassembly and endothelial barrier permeability by arresting tyrosine phosphorylation of \u03b1-catenin and VE-cadherin and their dislocation from AJ via blockade of XO-mediated ROS production and thereby suppression of SHP2 inhibition and Frk activation. We have also found that the protective effects of RvD1 on EC barrier function involve ALX/FPR2 and GPR32 as inhibition or neutralization of these receptors negates its protective effects. LPS also increased XO activity, SHP2 cysteine oxidation and its inactivation, Frk activation, \u03b1-catenin and VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation and their dissociation from each other leading to AJ disruption with increased vascular permeability in mice arteries and RvD1 blocked all these effects. Thus, RvD1 protects endothelial AJ and its barrier function from disruption by inflammatory mediators such as LPS via a mechanism involving the suppression of XO-mediated ROS production and blocking SHP2 inactivation.",

     "abstract": "Fluorescent proteins are an important tool that has become omnipresent in life sciences research. They are frequently used for localization of proteins and monitoring of cells [1], [2]. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was the first and has been the most used fluorescent protein. Enhanced GFP (eGFP) was optimized from wild-type GFP for increased fluorescence yield and improved expression in mammalian systems [3]. Many GFP-like fluorescent proteins have been discovered, optimized or created, such as the red fluorescent protein TagRFP [4]. Fluorescent proteins are expressed colorless and immature and, for eGFP, the conversion to the fluorescent form, mature, is known to produce one equivalent of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) per molecule of chromophore [5,6]. Even though it has been proposed that this process is non-catalytic and generates nontoxic levels of H2O2 [6], this study investigates the role of fluorescent proteins in generating free radicals and inducing oxidative stress in biological systems. Immature eGFP and TagRFP catalytically generate the free radical superoxide anion (O2\u2022\u2013) and H2O2 in the presence of NADH. Generation of the free radical O2\u2022\u2013 and H2O2 by eGFP in the presence of NADH affects the gene expression of cells. Many biological pathways are altered, such as a decrease in HIF1\u03b1 stabilization and activity. The biological pathways altered by eGFP are known to be implicated in the pathophysiology of many diseases associated with oxidative stress; therefore, it is critical that such experiments using fluorescent proteins are validated with alternative methodologies and the results are carefully interpreted. Since cells inevitably experience oxidative stress when fluorescent proteins are expressed, the use of this tool for cell labeling and in vivo cell tracing also requires validation using alternative methodologies.",

In the present study, the effects of three plant-derived natural compounds, i.e., sulforaphane (SFN), ursolic acid (UA) and betulinic acid (BA) on nucleolar state were investigated in breast cancer cell lines of different receptor status, namely MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and SK-BR-3 cells. Cytostatic action of phytochemicals against breast cancer cells was observed at low micromolar concentration window (5\u201320\u00a0\u00b5M) and mediated by elevated p21 levels, and cell proliferation of SFN-, UA- and BA-treated normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) was unaffected. Phytochemical-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation was accompanied by increased levels of superoxide and protein carbonylation that lead to disorganization of A- and B-type lamin networks and alterations in the nuclear architecture. Phytochemicals promoted nucleolar stress as judged by the nucleoplasmic translocation of RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3/TIF-IA, inhibition of new rRNA synthesis and decrease in number of nucleoli. Phytochemicals also decreased the levels of NOP2, proliferation-associated nucleolar protein p120, and WDR12 required for maturation of 28S and 5.8S ribosomal RNAs and formation of the 60S ribosome, and phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein that may result in diminished translation and inhibition of cell proliferation.

This study investigated whether impaired adipogenesis of omental (OM) adipose tissues and elevated 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) accumulation contribute to this process, and if combined metformin and insulin treatment in T2DM patients could rescue this phenotype.OM adipose tissues were obtained from forty clinically well characterized obese individuals during weight reduction surgery. Levels of 4-HNE protein adducts, adipocyte size and number of macrophages were determined within these tissues by immunohistochemistry. Adipogenic capacity and gene expression profiles were assessed in preadipocytes derived from these tissues in relation to insulin resistance and in response to 4-HNE, metformin or combined metformin and insulin treatment.Preadipocytes isolated from insulin resistant (IR) and T2DM individuals exhibited lower adipogenesis, marked by upregulation of anti-adipogenic genes, compared to preadipocytes derived from insulin sensitive (IS) individuals. Impaired adipogenesis was also associated with increased 4-HNE levels, smaller adipocytes and greater macrophage presence in the adipose tissues. Within the T2DM group, preadipocytes from combined metformin and insulin treated subset showed better in vitro adipogenesis compared to metformin alone, which was associated with less presence of macrophages and 4-HNE in the adipose tissues. Treatment of preadipocytes in vitro with 4-HNE reduced their adipogenesis and increased proliferation, even in the presence of metformin, which was partially rescued by the presence of insulin.This study reveals involvement of 4-HNE in the impaired OM adipogenesis-associated with insulin resistance and T2DM and provides a proof of concept that this impairment can be reversed by the synergistic action of insulin and metformin. Further studies are needed to evaluate involvement of 4-HNE in metabolically impaired abdominal adipogenesis and to confirm benefits of combined metformin-insulin therapy in T2DM patients.",

While several biochemical mediators have been implicated in RIC's mechanism of action, it remains unclear whether the localization or \u201cdose\u201d of RIC affects the extent of protective signaling. In this randomized crossover study of healthy individuals, we tested whether the number of cycles of RIC and its localization (arm versus thigh) determines biochemical signaling and cytoprotection. Subjects received either arm or thigh RIC and then were crossed over to receive RIC in the other extremity. Blood flow, tissue perfusion, concentrations of the circulating protective mediator nitrite, and platelet mitochondrial function were measured after each RIC cycle. We found that plasma nitrite concentration peaked after the first RIC cycle and remained elevated throughout RIC. This plasma nitrite conferred cytoprotection in an in vitro myocyte model of hypoxia/reoxygenation. Notably, though plasma nitrite returned to baseline at 24\u00a0h, RIC conditioned plasma still mediated protection. Additionally, no difference in endpoints between RIC in thigh versus arm was found. These data demonstrate that localization and \u201cdose\u201d of RIC does not affect cytoprotection and further elucidate the mechanisms by which nitrite contributes to RIC-dependent protection.",

H2S effects on tumors onset and development is scarcely studied, particularly concerning tumor angiogenesis. We previously demonstrated that H2S is proangiogenic for tumoral but not for normal endothelium and this may represent a target for antiangiogenic therapeutical strategies.in this work, we investigate cell viability, migration and tubulogenesis on human EC derived from two different tumors, breast and renal carcinoma (BTEC and RTEC), compared to normal microvascular endothelium (HMEC) under oxidative stress, hypoxia and treatment with exogenous H2S.all EC types are similarly sensitive to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide; chemical hypoxia differentially affects endothelial viability, that results unaltered by real hypoxia. H2S neither affects cell viability nor prevents hypoxia and H2O2-induced damage. Endothelial migration is enhanced by hypoxia, while tubulogenesis is inhibited for all EC types. H2S acts differentially on EC migration and tubulogenesis.these data provide evidence for a great variability of normal and altered endothelium in response to the environmental conditions.",

These physiological effects have been ascertained through in vitro treatment of cells with Na2S or NaHS, both of which are precursors of H2S. Since H2S exists as HS\u2212 in a neutral solution, a disulfide compound such as cystine could react with HS\u2212 in culture medium as well as in the cell.This study demonstrated that after the addition of Na2S solution into culture medium, HS\u2212 was transiently generated and disappeared immediately through the reaction between HS\u2212 and cystine to form cysteine persulfides and polysulfides in the culture medium (bound sulfur mixture: BS-Mix). Furthermore, we found that the addition of Na2S solution resulted in an increase of intracellular cysteine persulfide levels in SH-SY5Y cells. This alteration in intracellular persulfide was also observed in cystine-free medium.Considering this reaction of HS\u2212 as a precursor of BS-Mix, we highlighted the cytoprotective effect of Na2S on human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells against methylglyoxal (MG)-induced toxicity. BS-Mix produced with Na2S in cystine-containing medium provided SH-SY5Y cells significant protective effect against MG-induced toxicity. However, the protective effect was attenuated in cystine-free medium. Moreover, we observed that Na2S or BS-Mix activated the Keap1/Nrf2 system and increased glutathione (GSH) levels in the cell. In addition, the activation of Nrf2 is significantly attenuated in cystine-free medium.These results suggested that Na2S protects SH-SY5Y cells from MG cytotoxicity through the activation of Nrf2, mediated by cysteine persulfides and polysulfides that were generated by Na2S addition.",

A 304\u00a0bp HO-1 promoter region was amplified by PCR from sodium bisulfite-treated DNA, cloned into pGEMT plasmid vector and evaluated by DNA sequencing. Bisulfite sequencing analysis showed similar HO-1 promoter methylation levels in control and UV-B-treated plants (C: 3.4\u00b11.3%; 7.5: 2.6\u00b10.5%; 15: 3.1\u00b11.1%). Interestingly, HO-1 promoter was strongly unmethylated in control plants. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of TFs showed that GmMYB177, GmMYBJ6, GmWRKY21, GmNAC11, GmNAC20 and GmGT2A but not GmWRK13 and GmDREB were induced by UV-B radiation. The expression of several TFs was also enhanced by hemin, a potent and specific HO inducer, inferring that they may mediate HO-1 up-regulation. These results suggest that soybean HO-1 gene expression is not epigenetically regulated. Moreover, the low level of HO-1 promoter methylation suggests that this antioxidant enzyme can rapidly respond to environmental stress. Finally, this study has identified some stress-related TFs involved in HO-1 up-regulation under UV-B radiation.",

     "abstract": "Ferroptosis has been defined as an oxidative and iron-dependent pathway of regulated cell death that is distinct from caspase-dependent apoptosis and established pathways of death receptor-mediated regulated necrosis. While emerging evidence linked features of ferroptosis induced e.g. by erastin-mediated inhibition of the Xc- system or inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) to an increasing number of oxidative cell death paradigms in cancer cells, neurons or kidney cells, the biochemical pathways of oxidative cell death remained largely unclear. In particular, the role of mitochondrial damage in paradigms of ferroptosis needs further investigation.In the present study, we find that erastin-induced ferroptosis in neuronal cells was accompanied by BID transactivation to mitochondria, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation and reduced ATP levels. These hallmarks of mitochondrial demise are also established features of oxytosis, a paradigm of cell death induced by Xc- inhibition by millimolar concentrations of glutamate. Bid knockout using CRISPR/Cas9 approaches preserved mitochondrial integrity and function, and mediated neuroprotective effects against both, ferroptosis and oxytosis. Furthermore, the BID-inhibitor BI-6c9 inhibited erastin-induced ferroptosis, and, in turn, the ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 and liproxstatin-1 prevented mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death in the paradigm of oxytosis. These findings show that mitochondrial transactivation of BID links ferroptosis to mitochondrial damage as the final execution step in this paradigm of oxidative cell death.",

     "abstract": "Antioxidant glutathione (GSH) plays an important role in the regulation of immunity. However, little is known about its effects on humoral immunity, especially its action on effector molecules like antibody and complement. Given that these molecules contain abundant disulfide bonds, we speculated that GSH might influence the action of these proteins via its thiol function. Using a model of a glomerular mesangial cell (MC) lysis induced by antibodies plus complement, we addressed this hypothesis. Exposure of rat MCs to anti-Thy-1 antibody plus complement or anti-MC rabbit serum caused a complement-dependent cell lysis, which was completely blocked by GSH. Moreover, GSH potently prevented the antibody-mediated agglutination of red blood cells and aggregation of antibody-sensitized microspheres. Further analysis revealed that GSH inhibited antibody binding to antigens and promoted the conversion of the antibodies to its reduced forms. GSH also potently inhibited the formation and deposition of C5b-9 in MCs and suppressed both the classic and alternative complement activation pathway. Lastly, GSH attenuated P38 activation, an oxidative sensitive kinase that partially mediated the antibody- and complement-dependent MC lysis. Depletion of GSH via inhibiting gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase or xCT transporter augmented P38 activation and sensitized MCs to the cell lysis. Collectively, our results indicate that GSH protects cells from immunological cell damage via mechanisms involving inhibition of antibody binding to the antigens, suppression of complement activation and augmentation of cellular defense mechanism. Our study provides novel mechanistic insights into the actions of GSH in the regulation of immune responses and suggests that GSH might be used to treat certain immune disorders.",

     "abstract": "The notion that oxidative stress plays a role in virtually every human disease and environmental exposure has become ingrained in everyday knowledge. However, mounting evidence regarding the lack of specificity of biomarkers traditionally used as indicators of oxidative stress in human disease and exposures now necessitates re-evaluation. To prioritize these re-evaluations, published literature was comprehensively analyzed in a meta-analysis to quantitatively classify the levels of systemic oxidative damage across human disease and in response to environmental exposures.In this meta-analysis, the F2-isoprostane, 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1, was specifically chosen as the representative marker of oxidative damage. To combine published values across measurement methods and specimens, the standardized mean differences (Hedges\u2019 g) in 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels between affected and control populations were calculated.The meta-analysis resulted in a classification of oxidative damage levels as measured by 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 across 50 human health outcomes and exposures from 242 distinct publications. Relatively small increases in 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels (g<0.8) were found in the following conditions: hypertension (g=0.4), metabolic syndrome (g=0.5), asthma (g=0.4), and tobacco smoking (g=0.7). In contrast, large increases in 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels were observed in pathologies of the kidney, e.g., chronic renal insufficiency (g=1.9), obstructive sleep apnoea (g=1.1), and pre-eclampsia (g=1.1), as well as respiratory tract disorders, e.g., cystic fibrosis (g=2.3).In conclusion, we have established a quantitative classification for the level of 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 generation in different human pathologies and exposures based on a comprehensive meta-analysis of published data. This analysis provides knowledge on the true involvement of oxidative damage across human health outcomes as well as utilizes past research to prioritize those conditions requiring further scrutiny on the mechanisms of biomarker generation.",

     "abstract": "Ohr and OsmC proteins comprise two subfamilies within a large group of proteins that display Cys-based, thiol dependent peroxidase activity. These proteins were previously thought to be restricted to prokaryotes, but we show here, using iterated sequence searches, that Ohr/OsmC homologs are also present in 217 species of eukaryotes with a massive presence in Fungi (186 species). Many of these eukaryotic Ohr proteins possess an N-terminal extension that is predicted to target them to mitochondria. We obtained recombinant proteins for four eukaryotic members of the Ohr/OsmC family and three of them displayed lipoyl peroxidase activity. Further functional and biochemical characterization of the Ohr homologs from the ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis Mf_1 (MfOhr), the causative agent of Black Sigatoka disease in banana plants, was pursued. Similarly to what has been observed for the bacterial proteins, we found that: (i) the peroxidase activity of MfOhr was supported by DTT or dihydrolipoamide (dithiols), but not by \u03b2-mercaptoethanol or GSH (monothiols), even in large excess; (ii) MfOhr displayed preference for organic hydroperoxides (CuOOH and tBOOH) over hydrogen peroxide; (iii) MfOhr presented extraordinary reactivity towards linoleic acid hydroperoxides (k=3.18 (\u00b12.13)\u00d7108\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0s\u22121). Both Cys87 and Cys154 were essential to the peroxidase activity, since single mutants for each Cys residue presented no activity and no formation of intramolecular disulfide bond upon treatment with hydroperoxides. The pKa value of the Cysp residue was determined as 5.7\u00b10.1 by a monobromobimane alkylation method. Therefore, eukaryotic Ohr peroxidases share several biochemical features with prokaryotic orthologues and are preferentially located in mitochondria.",

Understanding the antioxidant response activated by the transcription factor Nrf2 has become very important in the aging field in order to activate cellular protection. However, the role of Nrf2 inducers during old age has not been completely understood. Our aim was to activate the Nrf2 pathway by pre-treating old rats with a widely used Nrf2-inducer, tert-buthylhydroquinone (tBHQ), prior to 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) insult, in order to evaluate its effects at a behavioral, morphological and biochemical levels. 3-NP has been used to reproduce the biochemical and pathophysiological characteristics of Huntington's disease due to an oxidative effect. Our results suggest that tBHQ confers an important protective effect against 3-NP toxicity; nevertheless, Nrf2 seems not to be the main protective pathway associated to neuroprotection. Hormetic responses include the activation of more than one transcription factor. Nrf2 and NF\u03baB are known to simultaneously initiate different cellular responses against stress by triggering parallel mechanisms, therefore NF\u03baB nuclear accumulation was also evaluated.",

And therefore the elimination of A\u03b2 is regarded as an important strategy for AD treatment. The discovery of drug candidates using culture neuronal cells against A\u03b2 peptide toxicity is believed to be an effective approach to develop drug for the treatment of AD patients. We have previously showed that artemisinin, a FDA-approved anti-malaria drug, has neuroprotective effects recently. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects and potential mechanism of artemisinin in protecting neuronal PC12 cells from toxicity of \u03b2 amyloid peptide. Our studies revealed that artemisinin, in clinical relevant concentration, protected and rescued PC12 cells from A\u03b225\u201335-induced cell death. Further study showed that artemisinin significantly ameliorated cell death due to A\u03b225\u201335 insult by restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology, lactate dehydrogenase, intracellular ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential and activity of apoptotic caspase. Western blotting analysis demonstrated that artemisinin activated extracellular regulated kinase ERK1/2 but not Akt survival signaling. Consistent with the role of ERK1/2, preincubation of cells with ERK1/2 pathway inhibitor PD98059 blocked the effect of artemisinin while PI3K inhibitor LY294002 has no effect. Moreover, A\u03b21-42 also caused cells death of PC12 cells while artemisinin suppressed A\u03b21-42 cytotoxicity in PC12 cells. Taken together, these results, at the first time, suggest that artemisinin is a potential protectant against \u03b2 amyloid insult through activation of the ERK1/2 pathway. Our finding provides a potential application of artemisinin in prevention and treatment of AD.",

     "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that natural bioactive compounds, alone or in combination with traditional chemotherapeutic agents, could be used as potential therapies to fight cancer. In this study, we employed four natural bioactive compounds (curcumin, resveratrol, melatonin, and silibinin) and studied their role in redox control and ability to promote apoptosis in androgen sensitive and insensitive prostate cancer cells. Here is shown that curcumin and resveratrol promote ROS production and induce apoptosis in LNCaP and PC-3. An increase in reactive species is a trigger event in curcumin-induced apoptosis and a consequence of resveratrol effects on other pathways within these cells. Moreover, here we demonstrated that these four compounds affect differently one of the main intracellular redox regulator, the thioredoxin system. Exposure to curcumin and resveratrol promoted TRX1 oxidation and altered its subcellular location. Furthermore, resveratrol diminished TRX1 levels in PC-3 cells and increased the expression of its inhibitor TXNIP. Conversly, melatonin and silibinin only worked as cytostatic agents, reducing ROS levels and showing preventive effects against TRX oxidation. All together, this work explores the effect of compounds currently tested as chemo-preventive agents in prostate cancer therapy, on the TRX1 redox state and function. Our work shows the importance that the TRX system might have within the differences found in their mechanisms of action. These bioactive compounds trigger different responses and affect ROS production and redox systems in prostate cancer cells, suggesting the key role that redox-related pathways might play in processes like differentiation or survival in prostate cancer.",

Excess body fat may therefore exacerbate the bioenergetic dysfunction observed with HIV infection. To determine if body fat is associated with bioenergetic function in HIV, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 42 women with HIV who were virologically suppressed on antiretroviral therapy. Body composition was determined via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of monocytes was sorted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from participants in the fasting state. Differences in bioenergetic function, as measured by OCR, was assessed using Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman correlations adjusted for age, race, and smoking status. Participants were 86% Black, 45.5 years old, 48% current smokers, and 57% were obese (body mass index \u226530). Nearly all women (93%) had >30% total fat mass, while 12% had >50% total fat mass. Elevated levels of total fat mass, trunk fat, and leg fat were inversely correlated with measures of bioenergetic health as evidenced by lower maximal and reserve capacity OCR, and Bioenergetic Health Index. Measures of extracellular acidification (ECAR) in the absence (basal) or maximal (with oligomycin) were positively correlated with measures of bioenergetics, except proton leak, and were negatively correlated with fat mass. Despite virological suppression, women with HIV present with extremely high levels of adiposity that correlate with impaired bioenergetic health. Without effective interventions, this syndemic of HIV infection and obesity will likely have devastating consequences for our patients, potentially mediated through altered mitochondrial and glycolytic function.",

However, it is not clear (i) whether increased PI3K/Akt phosphorylation is a concomitant event or it directly contributes to melatonin's neuroprotective effect, and (ii) how melatonin regulates PI3K/Akt signaling pathway after FCI. In this study, we showed that Akt was intensively phosphorylated at the Thr308 activation loop as compared with Ser473 by melatonin after FCI. Melatonin treatment reduced infarct volume, which was reversed by PI3K/Akt inhibition. However, PI3K/Akt inhibition did not inhibit melatonin's positive effect on brain swelling and IgG extravasation. Additionally, phosphorylation of mTOR, PTEN, AMPK\u03b1, PDK1 and RSK1 were increased, while phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, GSK-3\u03b1/\u03b2, S6 ribosomal protein were decreased in melatonin treated animals. In addition, melatonin decreased apoptosis through reduced p53 phosphorylation by the PI3K/Akt pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrated the activation profiles of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway components in the pathophysiological aspect of ischemic stroke and melatonin's neuroprotective activity. Our data suggest that Akt phosphorylation, preferably at the Thr308 site of the activation loop via PDK1 and PTEN, mediates melatonin's neuroprotective activity and increased Akt phosphorylation leads to reduced apoptosis.",

We found that cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and nuclear factor-\u03baB activity were reduced but p53 activation was increased in PARK2 KO as compared to non-Tg mice. These effects were associated with reduced p53 degradation. Parkin was found to interact with p53; however, this was abolished in Parkin KO mice, which prevented p53 degradation. Treatment of PARK2 KO mice with p53 inhibitor increased Parkin expression as well as inflammation and RA development while decreasing nuclear p53 translocation, demonstrating that PARK2 deficiency inhibits inflammation in RA via suppression of p53 degradation. These results suggest that RA development may be reduced in PD patients.",

Hence, the purpose of present study is to clarify whether H2O2 alters these parameters.Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated with H2O2 (1\u20131000\u00a0\u00b5M) for 24\u00a0h and AChE activity and AChE and cytochrome c levels were evaluated. AChE activity was strongly increased from 1\u00a0\u00b5M to 1000\u00a0\u00b5M of H2O2. The results of the kinetic study showed that H2O2 affected Vmax but not Km; and also that H2O2 changed the sigmoid kinetic observed in control samples to hyperbolic kinetic. Thus, results suggest that H2O2 acts as an allosteric activators.

     "abstract": "Chronic exposure of the skin to solar UV radiation induces a number of biological alterations, including a redox imbalance; therefore, there is an urgent need for skin cells protective compounds. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of natural, previously extensively examined, polyphenol with antioxidant properties \u2013 rutin, on UV-induced skin fibroblasts membrane disruption. Accordingly, fibroblasts exposed to UVA and UVB irradiation were incubated with rutin (12\u00a0h before and/or up to 24\u00a0h after irradiation), and the structural and metabolic changes were examined. Rutin penetration through the fibroblast phospholipid bilayer was aided by UVA-induced bilitranslocase activity 2\u20134\u00a0h after irradiation, while UVB irradiation led to enhanced phospholipid peroxidation and higher membrane permeability to facilitate the interaction of rutin with phospholipids. Lipidomic analysis revealed that 4\u00a0h of rutin treatment also partially prevented UVA/B-induced increase in phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine level, as well as their membrane localization, which resulted in an enhanced zeta potential in the cells and liposomes. Moreover, rutin 2\u00a0h following irradiation, in a various degree, prevented the increased in phospholipase A2 activity and ROS generation, and partially protected against the reduction of arachidonic and linoleic acids level and the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal level increase. Rutin effectively prevented against decrease in glutathione peroxidase, glutathione and vitamins E and C activities/levels, particularly 2\u00a0h following UVA irradiation.In conclusion, highest skin fibroblasts membrane level of rutin occurred in 2\u20134\u00a0h following UVA/B-radiation results in its strongest effect on biomembrane structure and functions and cellular antioxidant system irrespective of the radiation type.",

     "abstract": "Resveratrol (RSV) is a naturally occurring polyphenolic compound endowed with interesting biological properties/functions amongst which are its activity as an antioxidant and as Sirtuin activating compound towards SIRT1 in mammals. Sirtuins comprise a family of NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases that are involved in many physiological and pathological processes including aging and age-related diseases. These enzymes are conserved across species and SIRT1 is the closest mammalian orthologue of Sir2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the field of aging researches, it is well known that Sir2 is a positive regulator of replicative lifespan and, in this context, the RSV effects have been already examined. Here, we analyzed RSV effects during chronological aging, in which Sir2 acts as a negative regulator of chronological lifespan (CLS). Chronological aging refers to quiescent cells in stationary phase; these cells display a survival-based metabolism characterized by an increase in oxidative stress. We found that RSV supplementation at the onset of chronological aging, namely at the diauxic shift, increases oxidative stress and significantly reduces CLS. CLS reduction is dependent on Sir2 presence both in expired medium and in extreme Calorie Restriction. In addition, all data point to an enhancement of Sir2 activity, in particular Sir2-mediated deacetylation of the key gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1). This leads to a reduction in the amount of the acetylated active form of Pck1, whose enzymatic activity is essential for gluconeogenesis and CLS extension.",

     "abstract": "Stem cells are believed to maintain a specific intracellular redox status through a combination of enhanced removal capacity and limited production of ROS. In the present study, we challenge this assumption by developing a quantitative approach for the analysis of the pro- and antioxidant ability of human embryonic stem cells in comparison with their differentiated descendants, as well as adult stem and non-stem cells. Our measurements showed that embryonic stem cells are characterized by low ROS level, low rate of extracellular hydrogen peroxide removal and low threshold for peroxide-induced cytotoxicity. However, biochemical normalization of these parameters to cell volume/protein leads to matching of normalized values in stem and differentiated cells and shows that tested in the present study cells (human embryonic stem cells and their fibroblast-like progenies, adult mesenchymal stem cells, lymphocytes, HeLa) maintain similar intracellular redox status. Based on these observations, we propose to use ROS concentration averaged over the cell volume instead of ROS level as a measure of intracellular redox balance. We show that attempts to use ROS level for comparative analysis of redox status of morphologically different cells could lead to false conclusions. Methods for the assessment of ROS concentration based on flow cytometry analysis with the use of H2DCFDA dye and HyPer, genetically encoded probe for hydrogen peroxide, are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Tobacco smoking and hemodynamic forces are key stimuli in the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. High laminar flow has an atheroprotective effect on the endothelium and leads to a reduced response of endothelial cells to cardiovascular risk factors compared to regions with disturbed or low laminar flow. We hypothesize that the atheroprotective effect of high laminar flow could delay the development of endothelial dysfunction caused by cigarette smoking. Primary human endothelial cells were stimulated with increasing dosages of aqueous cigarette smoke extract (CSEaq). CSEaq reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner. The main mediator of cellular adaption to oxidative stress, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and its target genes heme oxygenase (decycling) 1 (HMOX1) or NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1) were strongly increased by CSEaq in a dose-dependent manner. High laminar flow induced elongation of endothelial cells in the direction of flow, activated the AKT/eNOS pathway, increased eNOS expression, phosphorylation and NO release. These increases were inhibited by CSEaq. Pro-inflammatory adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1), selectin E (SELE) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2/MCP-1) were increased by CSEaq. Low laminar flow induced VCAM1 and SELE compared to high laminar flow. High laminar flow improved endothelial wound healing. This protective effect was inhibited by CSEaq in a dose-dependent manner through the AKT/eNOS pathway. Low as well as high laminar flow decreased adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells. Whereas, monocyte adhesion was increased by CSEaq under low laminar flow, this was not evident under high laminar flow.This study shows the activation of major atherosclerotic key parameters by CSEaq. Within this process, high laminar flow is likely to reduce the harmful effects of CSEaq to a certain degree. The identified molecular mechanisms might be useful for development of alternative therapy concepts.",

Among diabetes-free participants who were not lost during the follow-up (N=1234), 75 developed diabetes over time. The multivariable adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for diabetes prevalence comparing the second and third to the first tertiles of plasma selenium levels were 1.80 (1.03, 3.14) and 1.97 (1.14, 3.41), respectively.

In addition, we observed significant interactions between selenium and polymorphisms in PPARGC1A, and in genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, such as BCS1L and SDHA, and suggestive interactions of selenium with other genes related to selenoproteins and redox metabolism.Plasma selenium was positively associated with prevalent and incident diabetes. While the statistical interactions of selenium with polymorphisms involved in regulation of redox and insulin signaling pathways provide biological plausibility to the positive associations of selenium with diabetes, further research is needed to elucidate the causal pathways underlying these associations.",

No study has tracked the seasonal variation of 25(OH)D and its putative influence on whole body energy metabolism, cellular bioenergetic profiles, inflammatory markers and clinical chemistry.Whole body energy metabolism and substrate utilisation were measured by indirect calorimetry. PBMCs obtained from the same subjects were isolated from whole blood, counted and freshly seeded. Bioenergetic analysis (mitochondrial stress test and glycolysis stress test) was performed using the Seahorse XFe96 flux analyser. 25(OH)D was assessed using the Architect immunoassay method.25(OH)D increased by a median (IQR) of 14.40 (20.13)\u00a0nmol/L (p<0.001) from winter to summer and was accompanied by significant improvements in indices of insulin sensitivity, McAuley's index (p=0.019) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (p=0.028). PBMC mitochondrial parameters basal respiration, non-mitochondrial respiration, ATP production, proton leak, and maximal respiration decreased in summer compared to winter. Similarly, PBMC glycolytic parameters glycolytic activity, glucose response, and glycolytic capacity were all reduced in summer compared to winter. There was also a trend for absolute resting metabolic rate (RMR) to decrease (p=0.066). Markers of systemic inflammation MCP-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12p70 decreased significantly in summer compared to winter. Participants who entered winter with a low 25(OH)D (<50\u00a0nmol/L), had the greatest alteration in bioenergetic parameters in summer, relative to those with winter 25(OH)D concentrations of 50\u201375\u00a0nmol/L or >75\u00a0nmol/L. The absolute change in 25(OH)D was not associated with altered bioenergetics.Seasonal improvements in 25(OH)D was associated with reduced systemic inflammation, PBMC bioenergetic profiles and whole body energy metabolism. These observational changes in PBMC bioenergetics were most pronounced in those who had insufficient 25(OH)D in winter. The data warrants confirmation through cause and effect study designs.",

     "abstract": "There is increasing evidence for the involvement of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an anti-inflammatory transcription factor that regulates the oxidative stress defense. Our previous experiments demonstrated that kavalactones protect neuronal cells against Amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2)-induced oxidative stress in vitro by Nrf2 pathway activation. Here, we tested an in vivo kavalactone treatment in a mouse model of AD.The kavalactone methysticin was administered once a week for a period of 6 months to 6 month old transgenic APP/Psen1 mice by oral gavage. Nrf2 pathway activation was measured by methysticin treatment of ARE-luciferase mice, by qPCR of Nrf2-target genes and immunohistochemical detection of Nrf2. A\u03b2 burden was analyzed by CongoRed staining, immunofluorescent detection and ELISA. Neuroinflammation was assessed by immunohistochemical stainings for microglia and astrocytes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines in the hippocampus was determined by Luminex multi-plex assays. The hippocampal oxidative damage was detected by oxyblot technique and immunohistochemical staining against DT3 and 4-HNE. The cognitive ability of mice was evaluated using Morris water maze.Methysticin treatment activated the Nrf2 pathway in the hippocampus and cortex of mice. The A\u03b2 deposition in brains of methysticin-treated APP/Psen1 mice was not altered compared to untreated mice. However, methysticin treatment significantly reduced microgliosis, astrogliosis and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u03b1 and IL-17A. In addition, the oxidative damage of hippocampi from APP/Psen1 mice was reduced by methysticin treatment. Most importantly, methysticin treatment significantly attenuated the long-term memory decline of APP/Psen1 mice.In summary, these findings show that methysticin administration activates the Nrf2 pathway and reduces neuroinflammation, hippocampal oxidative damage and memory loss in a mouse model of AD. Therefore, kavalactones might be suitable candidates to serve as lead compounds for the development of a new class of neuroprotective drugs.",

Administration of MnBuOE for one week before cranial irradiation and continued for one week afterwards supported production and long-term survival of newborn neurons in the hippocampal dentate gyrus.

A better understanding of how preserved hippocampal neurogenesis correlates with cognitive functions following cranial irradiation will be helpful in designing better MnP-based radioprotection strategies.",

     "abstract": "Myeloperoxidase produces strong oxidants during the immune response to destroy invading pathogens. However, these oxidants can also cause tissue damage, which contributes to the development of numerous inflammatory diseases. Selenium containing compounds, including selenomethionine (SeMet) and 1,4-anhydro-5-seleno-D-talitol (SeTal), react rapidly with different MPO-derived oxidants to form the respective selenoxides (SeMetO and SeTalO). This study investigates the susceptibility of these selenoxides to undergo reduction back to the parent compounds by intracellular reducing systems, including glutathione (GSH) and the glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase systems. GSH is shown to reduce SeMetO and SeTalO, with consequent formation of GSSG with apparent second order rate constants, k2, in the range 103\u2013104\u00a0M\u22121\u00a0s\u22121. Glutathione reductase reduces both SeMetO and SeTalO at the expense of NADPH via formation of GSSG, whereas thioredoxin reductase acts only on SeMetO. The presence of SeMet and SeTal also increased the rate at which NADPH was consumed by the glutathione reductase system in the presence of N-chloramines. In contrast, the presence of SeMet and SeTal reduced the rate of NADPH consumption by the thioredoxin reductase system after addition of N-chloramines, consistent with the rapid formation of selenoxides, but only slow reduction by thioredoxin reductase. These results support a potential role of seleno compounds to act as catalytic scavengers of MPO-derived oxidants, particularly in the presence of glutathione reductase and NADPH, assuming that sufficient plasma levels of the parent selenoether can be achieved in vivo following supplementation.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol use disorders are common both in the United States and globally, and are associated with a variety of co-morbid, inflammation-linked diseases. The pathogenesis of many of these ailments are driven by the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a multi-protein intracellular pattern recognition receptor complex that facilitates the cleavage and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18. We hypothesized that protracted exposure of leukocytes to ethanol would amplify inflammasome activation, which would help to implicate mechanisms involved in diseases associated with both alcoholism and aberrant NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Here we show that long-term ethanol exposure of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a mouse macrophage cell line (J774) amplifies IL-1\u03b2 secretion following stimulation with NLRP3 agonists, but not with AIM2 or NLRP1b agonists. The augmented NRLP3 activation was mediated by increases in iNOS expression and NO production, in conjunction with increases in mitochondrial membrane depolarization, oxygen consumption rate, and ROS generation in J774 cells chronically exposed to ethanol (CE cells), effects that could be inhibited by the iNOS inhibitor SEITU, the NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO, and the mitochondrial ROS scavenger MitoQ. Chronic ethanol exposure did not alter K+ efflux or Zn2+ homeostasis in CE cells, although it did result in a lower intracellular concentration of NAD+. Prolonged administration of acetaldehyde, the product of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) mediated metabolism of ethanol, mimicked chronic ethanol exposure, whereas ADH inhibition prevented ethanol-induced IL-1\u03b2 hypersecretion. Together, these results indicate that increases in iNOS and mitochondrial ROS production are critical for chronic ethanol-induced IL-1\u03b2 hypersecretion, and that protracted exposure to the products of ethanol metabolism are probable mediators of NLRP3 inflammasome hyperactivation.",

Studies with stable isotope tracers have revealed that under the new steady-state metabolic condition, the fluxes of TCA and glycolysis decrease while that of reductive carboxylation increases. Increased [\u03b1-ketoglutarate]/[succinate] ratio in NNT-deficient cells results in decrease in HIF-1\u03b1 level and expression of HIF-1\u03b1 regulated genes. Reduction in NADPH level leads to repression of HDAC1 activity and an increase in p53 acetylation.

MDA is absorbed in the blood system reacts with cell proteins to form adducts resulting in advanced lipid peroxidation end products (ALEs), producing dysfunctional proteins and cellular responses. The pathological consequences of ALEs tissue damage include inflammation and increased risk for many chronic diseases that are associated with a Western-type diet. In earlier studies we used the simulated gastric fluid (SGF) condition to show that the in vitro generation of MDA from red meat closely resembles that in human blood after consumption the same amount of meat. In vivo and in vitro MDA generations were similarly suppressed by polyphenol-rich beverages (red wine and coffee) consumed with the meal. The present study uses the in vitro SGF to assess the capacity of more than 50 foods of plant origin to suppress red meat peroxidation and formation of MDA. The results were calculated as reducing POS index (rPOSI) which represents the capacity in percent of 100\u00a0g of the food used to inhibit lipid peroxidation of 200\u00a0g red-meat a POSI enhancer (ePOSI). The index permitted to extrapolate the need of rPOSI from a food alone or in ensemble such Greek salad, to neutralize an ePOSI in stomach medium, (ePOS\u2013rPOSI=0). The correlation between the rPOSI and polyphenols in the tested foods was R2=0.75.

     "abstract": "Redox homeostasis regulates key cellular signaling pathways in both physiology and pathology. The cell's antioxidant response provides a defense against oxidative stress and establishes a redox tone permissive for cell signaling. The molecular regulation of the well-known Keap1/Nrf2 system acts as sensor responding to changes in redox homeostasis and is poorly studied in the heart. Importantly, it is not yet known whether Nrf2 alone can serve as a master regulator of cellular redox homeostasis without compensation of the transcriptional regulation of antioxidant response element (ARE) genes through alternate mechanisms. Here, we addressed this question using cardiac-specific transgenic expression at two different levels of constitutively active nuclear erythroid related factor 2 (caNrf2) functioning independently of Keap1. The caNrf2 mice showed augmentation of glutathione (GSH), the key regulator of the cellular thiol redox state. The Trans-AM assay for Nrf2-binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) showed a dose-dependent increase associated with upregulation of several major antioxidant genes and proteins. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in dihydroethidium staining and malondialdehyde (MDA) in the caNrf2-TG mice myocardium. Interestingly, caNrf2 gene-dosage dependent redox changes were noted resulting in generation of a multi-stage model of pro-reductive and reductive conditions in the myocardium of TG-low and TG-high mice, respectively. These data clearly show that Nrf2 levels alone are capable of serving as the master regulator of the ARE. These models provide an important platform to investigate the impact of the Nrf2 system independent of the need to regulate the activity of Keap1 and the consequent exposure to pro-oxidants or electrophiles, which have numerous off-target effects.",

A differential expression of microRNAs in the endometriotic tissues from women with endometriosis with pain compared to those without suggested a plausible role for miRNA or epigenetic mechanisms in the etiology of endometriotic pain. The peritoneal milieu is involved in maintenance of endometriotic lesion and nociception. We recently showed the mechanistic role for oxidized-lipoproteins (ox-LDLs) present in peritoneal fluid (PF) in endometriosis and pain. We explored the possibility of ox-LDLs modulating the expression of miRNAs in a manner similar to PF from women with endometriosis. Expression levels of miRNAs and their predicted nociceptive and inflammatory targets were determined in PF and ox-LDL treated human endometrial cell-lines. Samples from IRB-approved and consented patients with and without endometriosis or pain were used. These were compared to endometrial cell-lines treated with various forms of oxidized-lipoproteins. RNA (including miRNAs) were isolated from treated endometrial cells and expression levels were determined using commercial miRNome arrays. Cell lysates were used in immunoblotting for inflammatory proteins using a protein array. Twenty miRNAs including isoforms of miR-29, miR-181 and let-7 were mutually differentially expressed in cells treated with PF from endometriosis patients with pain and those treated with ox-LDL components. The ox-LDLs and endo-PF treatment also produced significant overexpression of microRNA predicted target genes nerve growth factor, interleukin-6 and prostaglandin E synthase and overexpression of their downstream protein targets Mip1\u03b1 and MCP1. This study showed similarities between miRNA regulation in PF from endometriotic women and ox-LDLs present in abundance in the PF of these women. Key miRNAs responsible for targeting nociceptive and inflammatory molecules were downregulated in the presence of ox-LDLs and endo-PF, thus playing a role in the etiology of endometriotic pain. These redox-sensitive miRNAs can be of potential use as targets in the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain.",

Esterified PUFAs in phospholipids exhibited temporal accumulation throughout the course of dauer endurance, followed by sharp reductions prior to termination of diapause. Reductions in esterified PUFAs were accompanied by concomitant increases in unbound PUFAs, as well as their corresponding downstream oxidized derivatives (i.e. eicosanoids).

It is important to determine the pathogenesis of central presbycusis in order to explore a feasible and effective intervention method. Recent work has provided fascinating insight into the beneficial function of H2S on oxidative stress and stress-related disease. In this study, we investigated the pathogenesis of central presbycusis and tried to explore the mechanism of H2S action on different aspects of aging by utilizing a mimetic aging rat and senescent cellular model. Our results indicate that NaHS decreased oxidative stress and apoptosis levels in an aging model via CaMKK\u03b2 and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Moreover, we found that NaHS restored the decreased activity of antioxidants such as GSH, SOD and CAT in the aging model in vivo and in vitro by regulating CaMKK\u03b2 and PI3K/AKT. Mitochondria function was preserved by NaHS, as indicated by the following: DNA POLG and OGG-1, the base excision repair enzymes in mitochondrial, were upregulated; OXPHOS activity was downregulated; mitochondrial membrane potential was restored; ATP production was increased; and mtDNA damage, indicated by the common deletion (CD), declined. These effects were also achieved by activating CaMKK\u03b2/AMPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Lastly, protein homeostasis, indicated by HSP90 alpha, was strengthened by NaHS via CaMKK\u03b2 and PI3K/AKT. Our findings demonstrate that the ability to resist oxidative stress and mitochondria function are both decreased as aging developed; however, NaHS, a novel free radical scavenger and mitochondrial protective agent, precludes the process of oxidative damage by activating CaMKK\u03b2 and PI3K/AKT.

     "abstract": "Sickle cell disease is caused by a mutant form of hemoglobin that polymerizes under hypoxic conditions, increasing rigidity, fragility, calcium influx-mediated dehydration, and adhesivity of red blood cells. Increased red cell fragility results in hemolysis, which reduces nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and induces platelet activation and inflammation leading to adhesion of circulating blood cells. Nitric Oxide inhibits adhesion and platelet activation. Nitrite has emerged as an attractive therapeutic agent that targets delivery of NO activity to areas of hypoxia through bioactivation by deoxygenated red blood cell hemoglobin. In this study, we demonstrate anti-platelet activity of nitrite at doses achievable through dietary interventions with comparison to similar doses with other NO donating agents. Unlike other NO donating agents, nitrite activity is shown to be potentiated in the presence of red blood cells in hypoxic conditions. We also show that nitrite reduces calcium associated loss of phospholipid asymmetry that is associated with increased red cell adhesion, and that red cell deformability is also improved. We show that nitrite inhibits red cell adhesion in a microfluidic flow-channel assay after endothelial cell activation. In further investigations, we show that leukocyte and platelet adhesion is blunted in nitrite-fed wild type mice compared to control after either lipopolysaccharide- or hemolysis-induced inflammation. Moreover, we demonstrate that nitrite treatment results in a reduction in adhesion of circulating blood cells and reduced red blood cell hemolysis in humanized transgenic sickle cell mice subjected to local hypoxia. These data suggest that nitrite is an effective anti-platelet and anti-adhesion agent that is activated by red blood cells, with enhanced potency under physiological hypoxia and in venous blood that may be useful therapeutically.",

Both, molecular oxygen and ROS are powerful regulators of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1-subunit (HIF-\u03b1). While a number of mechanisms in the oxygen-dependent HIF-\u03b1 regulation are quite well known, the view with respect to mitochondria is less clear. Several approaches using pharmacological or genetic tools targeting the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) indicated that ROS, mainly formed at the Rieske cluster of complex III of the ETC, are drivers of HIF-1\u03b1 activation. However, studies investigating non-ETC located mitochondrial defects and their effects on HIF-1\u03b1 regulation are scarce, if at all existing. Thus, in the present study we examined three cell lines with non-ETC mitochondrial defects and focused on HIF-1\u03b1 degradation and transcription, target gene expression, as well as ROS levels. We found that cells lacking the key enzyme 2-enoyl thioester reductase/mitochondrial enoyl-CoA reductase (MECR), and cells lacking manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) showed a reduced induction of HIF-1\u03b1 under long-term (20\u00a0h) hypoxia. By contrast, cells lacking the mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome channel protein Mpv17 displayed enhanced levels of HIF-1\u03b1 already under normoxic conditions. Further, we show that ROS do not exert a uniform pattern when mediating their effects on HIF-1\u03b1, although all mitochondrial defects in the used cell types increased ROS formation. Moreover, all defects caused a different HIF-1\u03b1 regulation via promoting HIF-1\u03b1 degradation as well as via changes in HIF-1\u03b1 transcription. Thereby, MECR- and MnSOD-deficient cells showed a reduction in HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels whereas the Mpv17 lacking cells displayed enhanced HIF-1\u03b1 mRNA levels under normoxia and hypoxia. Altogether, our study shows for the first time that mitochondrial defects which are not related to the ETC and Krebs cycle contribute differently to HIF-1\u03b1 regulation by affecting HIF-1\u03b1 degradation and HIF-1\u03b1 transcription where ROS play not a major role.",

On the other hand, if the antioxidant treatment takes place after the summit of the bell-shaped dose response curve, antioxidant treatment would have beneficial effects on function. We suggest that the effects of antioxidant treatment are dependent on the intensity of exercise, since the adaptive response, which is multi pathway dependent, is strongly influenced by exercise intensity. It is further suggested that levels of ROS concentration are associated with peak physiological function and can be extended by physical fitness level and this could be the basis for exercise pre-conditioning.

     "abstract": "The signaling networks that drive the aging process, associated functional deterioration, and pathologies has captured the scientific community's attention for decades. While many theories exist to explain the aging process, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) provides a signaling link between engagement of cellular senescence and several age-associated pathologies. Cellular senescence has evolved to restrict tumor progression but the accompanying senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) promotes pathogenic pathways. Here, we review known biological theories of aging and how ROS mechanistically control senescence and the aging process. We also describe the redox-regulated signaling networks controlling the SASP and its important role in driving age-related diseases. Finally, we discuss progress in designing therapeutic strategies that manipulate the cellular redox environment to restrict age-associated pathology.",

In eukaryotic cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) has both physiological and toxic effects. Both MAPK cascades and ROS signaling are involved in plant response to various biotic and abiotic stresses. It has been observed that not only can ROS induce MAPK activation, but also that disturbing MAPK cascades can modulate ROS production and responses. This review will discuss the potential mechanisms by which ROS may activate and/or regulate MAPK cascades in plants. The role of MAPK cascades and ROS signaling in regulating gene expression, stomatal function, and programmed cell death (PCD) is also discussed. In addition, the relationship between Rboh-dependent ROS production and MAPK activation in PAMP-triggered immunity will be reviewed.",

In fibrosis, ROS promote activation and proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, activating TGF-\u03b2 pathway in an autocrine manner. In cancer, ROS account for its genomic instability, resistance to apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Importantly, ROS trigger cancer cell invasion through invadopodia formation as well as extravasation into a distant metastasis site. Use of antioxidant supplements, enzymes, and inhibitors for ROS-generating NADPH oxidases (NOX) is a logical therapeutic intervention for fibrosis and cancer. We review such attempts, progress, and challenges. Lastly, we review how nanoparticles with inherent antioxidant activity can also be a promising therapeutic option, considering their additional feature as a delivery platform for drugs, genes, and imaging agents.",

     "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is an endocrine-member of the FGF family. It is synthesized mainly in the liver, but it is also expressed in adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and many other organs. It has a key role in glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as in energy balance. FGF21 concentration in plasma is increased in patients with obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic syndrome. Recent findings suggest that such increment protects tissue from an increased oxidative stress environment. Different types of physical stress, such as strenuous exercising, lactation, diabetic nephropathy, cardiovascular disease, and critical illnesses, also increase FGF21 circulating concentration. FGF21 is now considered a stress-responsive hormone in humans. The discovery of an essential response element in the FGF21 gene, for the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), involved in the regulation of oxidative stress, and its relation with genes such as NRF2, TBP-2, UCP3, SOD2, ERK, and p38, places FGF21 as a key regulator of the oxidative stress cell response. Its role in chronic diseases and its involvement in the treatment and follow-up of these diseases has been recently the target of new studies. The diminished oxidative stress through FGF21 pathways observed with anti-diabetic therapy is another clue of the new insights of this hormone.",

     "abstract": "Rare pleiotropic genetic disorders, Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), Bloom syndrome (BS) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) are characterised by immunodeficiency, extreme radiosensitivity, higher cancer susceptibility, premature aging, neurodegeneration and insulin resistance. Some of these functional abnormalities can be explained by aberrant DNA damage response and chromosomal instability. It has been suggested that one possible common denominator of these conditions could be chronic oxidative stress caused by endogenous ROS overproduction and impairment of mitochondrial homeostasis. Recent studies indicate new, alternative sources of oxidative stress in A-T, BS and NBS cells, including NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), oxidised low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) or Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP). Mitochondrial abnormalities such as changes in the ultrastructure and function of mitochondria, excess mROS production as well as mitochondrial damage have also been reported in A-T, BS and NBS cells. A-T, BS and NBS cells are inextricably linked to high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thereby, chronic oxidative stress may be a major phenotypic hallmark in these diseases. Due to the presence of mitochondrial disturbances, A-T, BS and NBS may be considered mitochondrial diseases. Excess activity of antioxidant enzymes and an insufficient amount of low molecular weight antioxidants indicate new pharmacological strategies for patients suffering from the aforementioned diseases. However, at the current stage of research we are unable to ascertain if antioxidants and free radical scavengers can improve the condition or prolong the survival time of A-T, BS and NBS patients. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct experimental studies in a human model.",

     "abstract": "Aging is a complex phenomenon and its impact is becoming more relevant due to the rising life expectancy and because aging itself is the basis for the development of age-related diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases and type 2 diabetes. Recent years of scientific research have brought up different theories that attempt to explain the aging process. So far, there is no single theory that fully explains all facets of aging. The damage accumulation theory is one of the most accepted theories due to the large body of evidence found over the years. Damage accumulation is thought to be driven, among others, by oxidative stress. This condition results in an excess attack of oxidants on biomolecules, which lead to damage accumulation over time and contribute to the functional involution of cells, tissues and organisms. If oxidative stress persists, cellular senescence is a likely outcome and an important hallmark of aging. Therefore, it becomes crucial to understand how senescent cells function and how they contribute to the aging process. This review will cover cellular senescence features related to the protein pool such as morphological and molecular hallmarks, how oxidative stress promotes protein modifications, how senescent cells cope with them by proteostasis mechanisms, including antioxidant enzymes and proteolytic systems. We will also highlight the nutritional status of senescent cells and aged organisms (including human clinical studies) by exploring trace elements and micronutrients and on their importance to develop strategies that might increase both, life and health span and postpone aging onset.",

In addition to the significant role played by plant peroxisomes in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS), data gathered over the last two decades show that these organelles are an endogenous source of nitric oxide (NO) and related molecules called reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Molecules such as NO and H2O2 act as retrograde signals among the different cellular compartments, thus facilitating integral cellular adaptation to physiological and environmental changes. However, under nitro-oxidative conditions, part of this network can be overloaded, possibly leading to cellular damage and even cell death. This review aims to update our knowledge of the ROS/RNS metabolism, whose important role in plant peroxisomes is still underestimated.

Proteostasis refers to all the processes by which cells control the abundance and folding of the proteome thanks to a wide network that integrates the regulation of signaling pathways, gene expression and protein degradation systems. This review attempts to summarize the most relevant findings about the transcriptional modulation of proteostasis exerted by the transcription factor NRF2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2). NRF2 has been classically considered as the master regulator of the antioxidant cell response, although it is currently emerging as a key component of the transduction machinery to maintain proteostasis. As we will discuss, NRF2 could be envisioned as a hub that compiles emergency signals derived from misfolded protein accumulation in order to build a coordinated and perdurable transcriptional response. This is achieved by functions of NRF2 related to the control of genes involved in the maintenance of the endoplasmic reticulum physiology, the proteasome and autophagy.",

     "abstract": "Recent studies in animal systems have shown that NO can interact with fatty acids to generate nitro-fatty acids (NO2-FAs). They are the product of the reaction between reactive nitrogen species and unsaturated fatty acids, and are considered novel mediators of cell signaling based mainly on a proven anti-inflammatory response. Although these signaling mediators have been described widely in animal systems, NO2-FAs have scarcely been studied in plants. Preliminary data have revealed the endogenous presence of free and protein-adducted NO2-FAs in extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), which appear to be contributing to the cardiovascular benefits associated with the Mediterranean diet. Importantly, new findings have displayed the endogenous occurrence of nitro-linolenic acid (NO2-Ln) in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and the modulation of NO2-Ln levels throughout this plant's development. Furthermore, a transcriptomic analysis by RNA-seq technology established a clear signaling role for this molecule, demonstrating that NO2-Ln was involved in plant-defense response against different abiotic-stress conditions, mainly by inducing the chaperone network and supporting a conserved mechanism of action in both animal and plant defense processes. Thus, NO2-Ln levels significantly rose under several abiotic-stress conditions, highlighting the strong signaling role of these molecules in the plant-protection mechanism. Finally, the potential of NO2-Ln as a NO donor has recently been described both in vitro and in vivo. Jointly, this ability gives NO2-Ln the potential to act as a signaling molecule by the direct release of NO, due to its capacity to induce different changes mediated by NO or NO-related molecules such as nitration and S-nitrosylation, or by the electrophilic capacity of these molecules through a nitroalkylation mechanism. Here, we describe the current state of the art regarding the advances performed in the field of NO2-FAs in plants and their implication in plant physiology.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria play a key role in maintaining cellular metabolic homeostasis. These organelles have a high plasticity and are involved in dynamic processes such as mitochondrial fusion and fission, mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. Type 2 diabetes is characterised by mitochondrial dysfunction, high production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and low levels of ATP. Mitochondrial fusion is modulated by different proteins, including mitofusin-1 (MFN1), mitofusin-2 (MFN2) and optic atrophy (OPA-1), while fission is controlled by mitochondrial fission 1 (FIS1), dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF). PARKIN and (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) participate in the process of mitophagy, for which mitochondrial fission is necessary. In this review, we discuss the molecular pathways of mitochondrial dynamics, their impairment under type 2 diabetes, and pharmaceutical approaches for targeting mitochondrial dynamics, such as mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (mdivi-1), dynasore, P110 and 15-oxospiramilactone. Furthermore, we discuss the pathophysiological implications of impaired mitochondrial dynamics, especially in type 2 diabetes.",

Hormesis is an adaptive mechanism generally activated by mild oxidative stress to protect the cells from further damage. Many phytochemicals have been shown to induce hormesis. This study aims to investigate whether the neuroprotective activity of BBR is mediated by hormesis and the related signaling pathways in 6-OHDA-induced PC12 cells and zebrafish neurotoxic models. Our results demonstrated that BBR induced a typical hormetic response in PC12 cells, i.e. low dose BBR significantly increased the cell viability, while high dose BBR inhibited the cell viability. Moreover, low dose BBR protected the PC12 cells from 6-OHDA-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis, whereas relatively high dose BBR did not show neuroprotective activity. The hormetic and neuroprotective effects of BBR were confirmed to be mediated by up-regulated PI3K/AKT/Bcl-2 cell survival and Nrf2/HO-1 antioxidative signaling pathways. In addition, low dose BBR markedly mitigated the 6-OHDA-induced dopaminergic neuron loss and behavior movement deficiency in zebrafish, while high dose BBR only slightly exhibited neuroprotective activities. These results strongly suggested that the neuroprotection of BBR were attributable to the hormetic mechanisms via activating cell survival and antioxidative signaling pathways.",

     "abstract": "Hyperoxic breathing might lead to redox imbalance and signaling changes that affect cerebral function. Paradoxically, hypoxic breathing is also believed to cause oxidative stress. Our aim is to dissect the cerebral tissue responses to altered O2 fractions in breathed air by assessing the redox imbalance and the recruitment of the hypoxia signaling pathways.Mice were exposed to mild hypoxia (10%O2), normoxia (21%O2) or mild hyperoxia (30%O2) for 28 days, sacrificed and brain tissue excised and analyzed. Although one might expect linear responses to %O2, only few of the examined variables exhibited this pattern, including neuroprotective phospho- protein kinase B and the erythropoietin receptor. The major reactive oxygen species (ROS) source in brain, NADPH oxidase subunit 4 increased in hypoxia but not in hyperoxia, whereas neither affected nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, a transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant proteins. As a result of the delicate equilibrium between ROS generation and antioxidant defense, neuron apoptosis and cerebral tissue hydroperoxides increased in both 10%O2 and 30%O2, as compared with 21%O2. Remarkably, the expression level of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)\u22122\u03b1 (but not HIF-1\u03b1) was higher in both 10%O2 and 30%O2 with respect to 21%O2Comparing the in vivo effects driven by mild hypoxia with those driven by mild hyperoxia helps addressing whether clinically relevant situations of O2 excess and scarcity are toxic for the organism.Prolonged mild hyperoxia leads to persistent cerebral damage, comparable to that inferred by prolonged mild hypoxia. The underlying mechanism appears related to a model whereby the imbalance between ROS generation and anti-ROS defense is similar, but occurs at higher levels in hypoxia than in hyperoxia.",

Vitamin B12 deficiency was found to significantly increase cellular H2O2 and NO content in Caenorhabditis elegans and significantly decrease low molecular antioxidant [reduced glutathione (GSH) and L-ascorbic acid] levels and antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase and catalase) activities, indicating that vitamin B12 deficiency induces severe oxidative stress leading to oxidative damage of various cellular components in worms. An NaCl chemotaxis associative learning assay indicated that vitamin B12 deficiency did not affect learning ability but impaired memory retention ability, which decreased to approximately 58% of the control value. When worms were treated with 1\u00a0mmol/L GSH, L-ascorbic acid, or vitamin E for three generations during vitamin B12 deficiency, cellular malondialdehyde content as an index of oxidative stress decreased to the control level, but the impairment of memory retention ability was not completely reversed (up to approximately 50%).

     "abstract": "In contrast to other mouse models that are deficient in antioxidant enzymes, mice null for Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice) show a major decrease in lifespan and several accelerated aging phenotypes. The goal of this study was to determine if cell senescence might be a contributing factor in the accelerated aging phenotype observed in the Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice. We focused on kidney because it is a tissue that has been shown to a significant increase in senescent cells with age. The Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice are characterized by high levels of DNA oxidation in the kidney, which is attenuated by DR. The kidney of the Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice also have higher levels of double strand DNA breaks than wild type (WT) mice. Expression (mRNA and protein) of p16 and p21, two of the markers of cellular senescence, which increased with age, are increased significantly in the kidney of Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice as is \u03b2-gal staining cells. In addition, the senescence associated secretory phenotype was also increased significantly in the kidney of Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice as measured by the expression of transcripts for IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Dietary restriction of the Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice attenuated the increase in DNA damage, cellular senescence, and expression of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2. Interestingly, the Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed higher levels of circulating cytokines than WT mice, suggesting that the accelerated aging phenotype shown by the Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice could result from increased inflammation arising from an accelerated accumulation of senescent cells. Based on our data with Sod1\u2212/\u2212 mice, we propose that various bouts of increased oxidative stress over the lifespan of an animal leads to the accumulation of senescent cells. The accumulation of senescent cells in turn leads to increased inflammation, which plays a major role in the loss of function and increased pathology that are hallmark features of aging.",

Virus replication and papillomavirus-induced cell transformation require persistent expression of viral oncoproteins E7 and E6 that must retain their functionality in a persistent oxidative environment. Here, we dissected the molecular mechanisms by which E7 oncoprotein can sense and manage the potentially harmful oxidative environment of the papillomavirus-infected cell. The carboxy terminal domain of E7 protein from most of the 79 papillomavirus viral types of alpha genus, which encloses all the tumorigenic viral types, is a cysteine rich domain that contains two classes of cysteines: strictly conserved low reactive Zn+2 binding and degenerate reactive cysteine residues that can sense reactive oxygen species (ROS). Based on experimental data obtained from E7 proteins from the prototypical viral types 16, 18 and 11, we identified a couple of low pKa nucleophilic cysteines that can form a disulfide bridge upon the exposure to ROS and regulate the cytoplasm to nucleus transport. From sequence analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction of redox sensing states we propose that reactive cysteine acquisition through evolution leads to three separate E7s protein families that differ in the ROS sensing mechanism: non ROS-sensitive E7s; ROS-sensitive E7s using only a single or multiple reactive cysteine sensing mechanisms and ROS-sensitive E7s using a reactive-resolutive cysteine couple sensing mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Although the lung is one of the least studied organs in diabetes, increasing evidence indicates that it is an inevitable target of diabetic complications. Nevertheless, the underlying biochemical mechanisms of lung injury in diabetes remain largely unexplored. Given that redox imbalance, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction have been implicated in diabetic tissue injury, we set out to investigate mechanisms of lung injury in diabetes. The objective of this study was to evaluate NADH/NAD+ redox status, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial abnormalities in the diabetic lung. Using STZ induced diabetes in rat as a model, we measured redox-imbalance related parameters including aldose reductase activity, level of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PAPR-1), NAD+ content, NADPH content, reduced form of glutathione (GSH), and glucose 6-phophate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity. For assessment of mitochondrial abnormalities in the diabetic lung, we measured the activities of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I to IV and complex V as well as dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLDH) content and activity. We also measured the protein content of NAD+ dependent enzymes such as sirtuin3 (sirt3) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1). Our results demonstrate that NADH/NAD+ redox imbalance occurs in the diabetic lung. This redox imbalance upregulates the activities of complexes I to IV, but not complex V; and this upregulation is likely the source of increased mitochondrial ROS production, oxidative stress, and cell death in the diabetic lung. These results, together with the findings that the protein contents of DLDH, sirt3, and NQO1 all are decreased in the diabetic lung, demonstrate that redox imbalance, mitochondrial abnormality, and oxidative stress contribute to lung injury in diabetes.",

While the primary biochemical feature of NPC disease is the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol and gangliosides, predominantly in endolysosomes, mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation has also been reported. As accumulation of cholesterol in mitochondria is known to impair the transport of GSH into mitochondria, resulting in mitochondrial GSH (mGSH) depletion, we investigated the impact of mGSH recovery in NPC disease. We show that GSH ethyl ester (GSH-EE), but not N-acetylcysteine (NAC), restored the mGSH pool in liver and brain of Npc1-/- mice and in fibroblasts from NPC patients, while both GSH-EE and NAC increased total GSH levels. GSH-EE but not NAC increased the median survival and maximal life span of Npc1-/- mice. Moreover, intraperitoneal therapy with GSH-EE protected against oxidative stress and oxidant-induced cell death, restored calbindin levels in cerebellar Purkinje cells and reversed locomotor impairment in Npc1-/- mice. High-resolution respirometry analyses revealed that GSH-EE improved oxidative phosphorylation, coupled respiration and maximal electron transfer in cerebellum of Npc1-/- mice. Lipidomic analyses showed that GSH-EE treatment had not effect in the profile of most sphingolipids in liver and brain, except for some particular species in brain of Npc1-/- mice. These findings indicate that the specific replenishment of mGSH may be a potential promising therapy for NPC disease, worth exploring alone or in combination with other options.",

Pharmacological modulators of this pathway have been extensively utilized in a wide range of basic research and pre-clinical studies. Bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine are commonly used compounds that inhibit autophagy by targeting the lysosomes but through distinct mechanisms. Since it is now clear that mitochondrial quality control, particularly in neurons, is dependent on autophagy, it is important to determine whether these compounds modify cellular bioenergetics. To address this, we cultured primary rat cortical neurons from E18 embryos and used the Seahorse XF96 analyzer and a targeted metabolomics approach to measure the effects of bafilomycin A1 and chloroquine on bioenergetics and metabolism. We found that both bafilomycin and chloroquine could significantly increase the autophagosome marker LC3-II and inhibit key parameters of mitochondrial function, and increase mtDNA damage. Furthermore, we observed significant alterations in TCA cycle intermediates, particularly those downstream of citrate synthase and those linked to glutaminolysis. Taken together, these data demonstrate a significant impact of bafilomycin and chloroquine on cellular bioenergetics and metabolism consistent with decreased mitochondrial quality associated with inhibition of autophagy.",

However, it remains unclear if mitochondrial O2\u2022\u2212 is causal in the development of AngII-induced hypertension, or if mitochondrial O2\u2022\u2212 in the absence of elevated AngII is sufficient to increase blood pressure. Further, the tissue specific (i.e. central versus peripheral) redox regulation of AngII hypertension remains elusive. Herein, we hypothesized that increased mitochondrial O2\u2022\u2212 in the absence of pro-hypertensive stimuli, such as AngII, elevates baseline systemic mean arterial pressure (MAP), and that AngII-mediated hypertension is exacerbated in animals with increased mitochondrial O2\u2022\u2212 levels. To address this hypothesis, we generated novel inducible knock-down mouse models of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), the O2\u2022\u2212 scavenging antioxidant enzyme specifically localized to mitochondria, targeted to either the brain subfornical organ (SFO) or peripheral tissues. Contrary to our hypothesis, knock-down of MnSOD either in the SFO or in peripheral tissues was not sufficient to alter baseline systemic MAP. Interestingly, when mice were challenged with chronic, peripheral infusion of AngII, only the MnSOD knock-down confined to the SFO, and not the periphery, demonstrated an increased sensitization and potentiated hypertension. In complementary experiments, over-expressing MnSOD in the SFO significantly decreased blood pressure in response to chronic AngII. Overall, these studies indicate that mitochondrial O2\u2022\u2212 in the brain SFO works in concert with other AngII-dependent factors to drive an increase in MAP, as elevated mitochondrial O2\u2022\u2212 alone, either in the SFO or peripheral tissues, failed to raise baseline blood pressure.",

We demonstrate here that the mitochondria of cultured, human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE-1) cells treated with SFN undergo hyperfusion that is independent of both Nrf2 and its cytoplasmic inhibitor KEAP1. Mitochondrial fusion has been reported to be cytoprotective by inhibiting pore formation in mitochondria during apoptosis, and consistent with this, we show Nrf2-independent, cytoprotection of SFN-treated cells exposed to the apoptosis-inducer, staurosporine. Mechanistically, SFN mitigates the recruitment and/or retention of the soluble fission factor Drp1 to mitochondria and to peroxisomes but does not affect overall Drp1 abundance. These data demonstrate that the beneficial properties of SFN extend beyond activation of the KEAP1-Nrf2-ARE system and warrant further interrogation given the current use of this agent in multiple clinical trials.",

We generated double mutants of hph-1-NOX1, hph-1-NOX2, hph-1-p47phox, and hph-1-NOX4. After two weeks of Ang II infusion, the incidence rate of AAA substantially dropped from 76.5% in Ang II infused hph-1 mice (n=34) to 11.1%, 15.0%, 9.5% and 0% in hph-1-NOX1 (n=27), hph-1-NOX2 (n=40), hph-1-p47phox (n=21), and hph-1-NOX4 (n=33) double mutant mice, respectively. The size of abdominal aortas of the four double mutant mice, determined by ultrasound analyses, was significantly smaller than the hph-1 mice. Aortic nitric oxide and H4B bioavailabilities were markedly improved in the double mutants, while superoxide production and eNOS uncoupling activity were substantially diminished. These effects seemed attributed to an endothelial specific restoration of dihydrofolate reductase expression and activity, deficiency of which has been shown to induce eNOS uncoupling and AAA formation in both Ang II-infused hph-1 and apoE null animals. In addition, over-expression of human NOX4 N129S or T555S mutant newly identified in aneurysm patients increased hydrogen peroxide production, further implicating a relationship between NOX and human aneurysm. Taken together, these data indicate that NOX isoforms 1, 2 or 4 lies upstream of dihydrofolate reductase deficiency and eNOS uncoupling to induce AAA formation. These findings may promote development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of the disease by inhibiting NOX signaling.",

     "abstract": "We recently reported that cluster determinant 36 (CD36), a fatty acid transporter, plays a pivotal role in glucotoxicity-induced \u03b2-cell dysfunction. However, little is known about how glucotoxicity influences CD36 expression. Emerging evidence suggests that the small GTPase Rac1 is involved in the pathogenesis of beta cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes (T2D). The primary objective of the current study was to determine the role of Rac1 in CD36 activation and its impact on \u03b2-cell dysfunction in diabetes mellitus. To address this question, we subjected INS-1 cells and human beta cells (1.1B4) to high glucose conditions (30\u00a0mM) in the presence or absence of Rac1 inhibition either by NSC23766 (Rac1 GTPase inhibitor) or small interfering RNA. High glucose exposure in INS-1 and human beta cells (1.1b4) resulted in the activation of Rac1 and induced cell apoptosis. Rac1 activation mediates NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation leading to elevated ROS production in both cells. Activation of the Rac1-NOX complex by high glucose levels enhanced CD36 expression in INS-1 and human 1.1b4 beta cell membrane fractions. The inhibition of Rac1 by NSC23766 inhibited NADPH oxidase activity and ROS generation induced by high glucose concentrations in INS-1 & human 1.1b4 beta cells. Inhibition of Rac1-NOX complex activation by NSC23766 significantly reduced CD36 expression in INS-1 and human 1.1b4 beta cell membrane fractions. In addition, Rac1 inhibition by NSC23766 significantly reduced high glucose-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, NADPH oxidase inhibition by VAS2870 also attenuated high glucose-induced ROS generation and cell apoptosis. These results suggest that Rac1-NADPH oxidase dependent CD36 expression contributes to high glucose-induced beta cell dysfunction and cell death.",

     "abstract": "After sudden traumatic brain injuries, secondary injuries may occur during the following days or weeks, which leads to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Since ROS exacerbate brain damage, it is important to protect neurons against their activity. Zinc finger protein 179 (Znf179) was shown to act as a neuroprotective factor, but the regulation of gene expression under oxidative stress remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrated an increase in Znf179 protein levels in both in vitro model of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced ROS accumulation and animal models of traumatic brain injury. Additionally, we examined the sub-cellular localization of Znf179, and demonstrated that oxidative stress increases Znf179 nuclear shuttling and its interaction with specificity protein 1 (Sp1). Subsequently, the positive autoregulation of Znf179 expression, which is Sp1-dependent, was further demonstrated using luciferase reporter assay and green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Znf179-expressing cells and transgenic mice. The upregulation of Sp1 transcriptional activity induced by the treatment with nerve growth factor (NGF) led to an increase in Znf179 levels, which further protected cells against H2O2-induced damage. However, Sp1 inhibitor, mithramycin A, was shown to inhibit NGF effects, leading to a decrease in Znf179 expression and lower cellular protection. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study show that Znf179 autoregulation through Sp1-dependent mechanism plays an important role in neuroprotection, and NGF-induced Sp1 signaling may help attenuate more extensive (ROS-induced) damage following brain injury.",

Two members of ROS-generating NADPH oxidase family, NOX1 and DUOX2, are highly inducible in the intestinal epithelium. Previously, we reported that Nox1 deficiency ameliorated the pathology in DKO mice (Nox1-TKO). The role of Duox2 in ileocolitis of the DKO mice is evaluated here in Duoxa-TKO mice by breeding DKO mice with Duoxa-/- mice (Duoxa-TKO), which do not have Duox2 activity. Similar to Nox1-TKO mice, Duoxa-TKO mice no longer have growth retardation, shortened intestine, exfoliation of crypt epithelium, crypt abscesses and depletion of goblet cells manifested in DKO mice by 35 days of age. Unlike Nox1-TKO mice, Duoxa-TKO mice still have rampant crypt apoptosis, elevated proliferation, partial loss of Paneth cells and diminished crypt density. Treating DKO mice with NOX inhibitors (di-2-thienyliodonium/DTI and thioridazine/THZ) and an antioxidant (mitoquinone/MitoQ) significantly reduced gut pathology. Furthermore, in the inflamed human colon, DUOX protein expression is highly elevated in the apical, lateral and perinuclear membrane along the whole length of gland. Taken together, we conclude that exfoliation of crypt epithelium, but not crypt apoptosis, is a major contributor to inflammation. Both Nox1 and Duox2 induce exfoliation of crypt epithelium, but only Nox1 induces apoptosis. NOX1 and DUOX2 may be potential therapeutic targets for treating ileocolitis in human patients suffering inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).",

Most cases are ascribed to a common mutation in the HFE gene, but the extent of clinical expression is greatly influenced by the combined action of yet unidentified genetic and/or environmental modifying factors. In mice, transcription factor NRF2 is a critical determinant of hepatocyte viability during exposure to acute dietary iron overload. We evaluated if the genetic disruption of Nrf2 would prompt the development of liver damage in Hfe-/- mice (an established model of human HFE-hemochromatosis).Wild-type, Nrf2-/-, Hfe-/- and double knockout (Hfe/Nrf2-/-) female mice on C57BL/6 genetic background were sacrificed at the age of 6 (young), 12\u201318 (middle-aged) or 24 months (old) for evaluation of liver pathology.Despite the parenchymal iron accumulation, Hfe-/- mice presented no liver injury. The combination of iron overload (Hfe-/-) and defective antioxidant defences (Nrf2-/-) increased the number of iron-related necroinflammatory lesions (sideronecrosis), possibly due to the accumulation of toxic oxidation products such as 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal-protein adducts. The engulfment of dead hepatocytes led to a gradual accumulation of iron within macrophages, featuring large aggregates. Myofibroblasts recruited towards the injury areas produced substantial amounts of collagen fibers involving the liver parenchyma of double-knockout animals with increased hepatic fibrosis in an age-dependent manner.The genetic disruption of Nrf2 promotes the transition from iron accumulation (siderosis) to liver injury in Hfe-/- mice, representing the first demonstration of spontaneous hepatic fibrosis in the long term in a mouse model of hereditary hemochromatosis displaying mildly elevated liver iron.",

     "publication date": "04-2017",
     "abstract": "Cisplatin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug showing high efficiency in the treatment of primary tumors such as ovarian, testicular and cervical cancers. The major drawback of cisplatin is tumor resistance either acquired or intrinsic. Many mechanisms are involved in the resistance, among them is the Nrf2 pathway which regulates glutathione related enzymes. Caffeic acid, a non-toxic polyphenol which is abundant in many foods modulates glutathione S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GSR) activity, these enzymes were shown to be involved in resistance of cells towards cisplatin. Caffeic acid induces the Nrf2 pathway and can also inhibit the activity of GST and GSR.Our findings demonstrate that the co-treatment of cancer cells with cisplatin and caffeic acid can enhance cisplatin cytotoxicity and increases the amount of platinum bound to nuclear DNA. However, 6\u00a0h of pre incubation with caffeic acid prior to cisplatin treatment led to acquired resistance to cisplatin and reduced DNA binding.In conclusion, the enzyme inhibitory action of caffeic acid is dominant when the two agents are co-administered leading to increased cytotoxicity, and the Nrf2 induction is dominant when the cells are treated with caffeic acid prior to cisplatin treatment leading to resistance.The use of caffeic acid as adjuvant for cisplatin should be carefully examined due to different pharmacokinetic profiles of caffeic acid and cisplatin. Thus, it is questionable if the two agents can reach the tumors at the right time frame in vivo.",

We used a set of loss-of-function models for in vivo and in vitro studies to address this controversy: peripheral neuron specific deletion (SNS-PKG1-/-), inducible deletion in subsets of neurons (SLICK-PKG1-/-) and redox-dead PKG1 mutants. In contrast to inflammatory pain, SNS-PKG1-/- mice developed stronger neuropathic hyperalgesia associated with an impairment of nerve regeneration, suggesting specific repair functions of PKG1. Although PKG1 accumulated at the site of injury, its activity was lost in the proximal nerve due to a reduction of oxidation-dependent dimerization, which was a consequence of mitochondrial damage in injured axons. In vitro, PKG1 deficiency or its redox-insensitivity resulted in enhanced outgrowth and reduction of growth cone collapse in response to redox signals, which presented as oxidative hotspots in growing cones. At the molecular level, PKG1 deficiency caused a depletion of phosphorylated cofilin, which is essential for growth cone collapse and guidance. Hence, redox-mediated guidance required PKG1 and consequently, its deficiency in vivo resulted in defective repair and enhanced neuropathic pain after nerve injury. PKG1-dependent repair functions will outweigh its signaling functions in spinal nociceptive LTP, so that inhibition of PKG1 is no option for neuropathic pain.",

The aim of this study was to investigate shifts in oxylipin and sphingolipid profiles stimulated by a hypercholesterolemic (HC) diet along with the modulating effects of onion introduced as an antioxidant functional ingredient characterized in the diet (HCO). Oxylipin and sphingolipid profiles were determined in plasma and tissues from Wistar rats using LC-MS/MS. Plasma \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 PUFA-derived oxylipins decreased in rats after 7 weeks of HC feeding, but did not evidence a further shift with HCO diet. Onion ingredient supplementation modulated the hepatic concentrations of prostaglandins and enhanced \u03c9-3 oxylipins in the liver of HCO-fed rats relative to the HC group. The HC diet induced shifts in plasma sphingolipids, increasing sphingoid bases, dihydroceramides and ceramides, whilst the sphingomyelin, hexosylceramide and lactosylceramide families decreased. The HCO diet modified some HC diet-induced changes in sphingolipids in liver and spleen tissue. Onion supplementation effected changes in lipid mediator levels in diet-induced hypercholesterolemic Wistar rats. The potential of onion as regulator of pro-inflammatory mediators, and possible enhancer of pro-resolution pathways, warrants further study of the interaction of functional ingredients with bioactive lipid mediators and their potential impact on inflammation, oxidative stress and organ dysfunction.",

Using autophagic bulk degradation cells can clear crosslinked macromolecules and damaged organelles that arise under redox stress. Accumulation of such debris results in cellular dysfunction and is observed in aged tissue and senescent cells. Conversely, promising anti-aging strategies aim at inhibiting the mTOR pathway and thereby activating autophagy, to counteract aging associated damage. We have inactivated autophagy related 7 (Atg7), an essential autophagy gene, in murine keratinocytes (KC) and have found in an earlier study that this resulted in increased baseline oxidative stress and reduced capacity to degrade crosslinked proteins after oxidative ultraviolet stress. To investigate whether autophagy deficiency would promote cellular aging, we studied how Atg7 deficient (KO) and Atg7 bearing cells (WT) would respond to stress induced by paraquat (PQ), an oxidant drug commonly used to induce cellular senescence.Atg7 deficient KC displayed increased prostanoid signaling and a pro- mitotic gene expression signature as compared to the WT. After exposure to PQ, both WT and KO cells showed an inflammatory and stress-related transcriptomic response. However, the Atg7 deficient cells additionally showed drastic DNA damage- and cell cycle arrest signaling. Indeed, DNA fragmentation and \u2013oxidation were strongly increased in the stressed Atg7 deficient cells upon PQ stress but also after oxidizing ultraviolet A irradiation. Damage associated phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) foci were increased in the nuclei, whereas expression of the nuclear lamina protein lamin B1 was strongly decreased. Similarly, in both, PQ treated mouse tail skin explants and in UVA irradiated mouse tail skin, we found a strong increase in \u03b3H2AX positive nuclei within the basal layer of Atg7 deficient epidermis.Atg7 deficiency significantly affected expression of lipid metabolic genes. Therefore we performed lipid profiling of keratinocytes which demonstrated a major dysregulation of cellular lipid metabolism. We found accumulation of autophagy agonisitic free fatty acids, whereas triglyceride levels were strongly decreased. Together, our data show that in absence of Atg7/autophagy the resistance of keratinocytes to intrinsic and environmental oxidative stress was severely impaired and resulted in DNA damage, cell cycle arrest and a disturbed lipid phenotype, all typical for premature cell aging.",

Cu dyshomeostasis has been demonstrated to be involved in some neurological conditions including Menkes and Alzheimer's diseases. We have previously reported localized Cu-rich aggregates in astrocytes of the subventricular zone (SVZ) in rodent brains with Cu concentrations in the hundreds of millimolar. Metallothionein, a cysteine-rich protein critical to metal homeostasis and known to participate in a variety of neuroprotective and neuroregenerative processes, was proposed as a binding protein. Here, we present an analysis of metallothionein(1,2) knockout (MTKO) mice and age-matched controls using X-ray fluorescence microscopy. In large structures such as the corpus callosum, cortex, and striatum, there is no significant difference in Cu, Fe, or Zn concentrations in MTKO mice compared to age-matched controls. In the astrocyte-rich subventricular zone where Cu-rich aggregates reside, approximately 1/3 as many Cu-rich aggregates persist in MTKO mice resulting in a decrease in periventricular Cu concentration. Aggregates in both wild-type and MTKO mice show XANES spectra characteristic of CuxSy multimetallic clusters and have similar [S]/[Cu] ratios. Consistent with assignment as a CuxSy multimetallic cluster, the astrocyte-rich SVZ of both MTKO and wild-type mice exhibit autofluorescent bodies, though MTKO mice exhibit fewer. Furthermore, XRF imaging of Au-labeled lysosomes and ubiquitin demonstrates a lack of co-localization with Cu-rich aggregates suggesting they are not involved in a degradation pathway. Overall, these data suggest that Cu in aggregates is bound by either metallothionein-3 or a yet unknown protein similar to metallothionein.",

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating cancer cell death and the resistance of cells to artesunate remain unclear. We investigated the molecular mechanisms behind the antitumor effects of artesunate and an approach to overcome artesunate resistance in head and neck cancer (HNC). The effects of artesunate and trigonelline were tested in different HNC cell lines, including three cisplatin-resistant HNC cell lines. The effects of these drugs as well as the inhibition of Keap1, Nrf2, and HO-1 were assessed by cell viability, cell death, glutathione (GSH) and ROS production, protein expression, and mouse tumor xenograft models. Artesunate selectively killed HNC cells but not normal cells. The artesunate sensitivity was relatively low in cisplatin-resistant HNC cells. Artesunate induced ferroptosis in HNC cells by decreasing cellular GSH levels and increasing lipid ROS levels. This effect was blocked by co-incubation with ferrostatin-1 and a trolox pretreatment. Artesunate activated the Nrf2\u2013antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway in HNC cells, which contributed to ferroptosis resistance. The silencing of Keap1, a negative regulator of Nrf2, decreased artesunate sensitivity in HNC cells. Nrf2 genetic silencing or trigonelline reversed the ferroptosis resistance of Keap1-silenced and cisplatin-resistant HNC cells to artesunate in vitro and in vivo. Nrf2\u2013ARE pathway activation contributes to the artesunate resistance of HNC cells, and inhibition of this pathway abolishes ferroptosis-resistant HNC.Our results show the effectiveness and molecular mechanism of artesunate treatment on head and neck cancer (HNC). Artesunate selectively killed HNC cells but not normal cells by inducing an iron-dependent, ROS-accumulated ferroptosis. However, this effect may be suboptimal in some cisplatin-resistant HNCs because of Nrf2\u2013antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway activation.

Various structurally diverse stimulators activate the NLRP3 inflammasome through different signaling pathways. We previously reported that ugonin U (UgU), a natural flavonoid isolated from Helminthostachys zeylanica (L) Hook, directly stimulates phospholipase C (PLC) and triggers superoxide release in human neutrophils. In the present study, we showed that UgU induced NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and subsequent caspase-1 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 processing in lipopolysaccharide-primed human monocytes. Moreover, UgU elicited mitochondrial superoxide generation in a dose-dependent manner, and a specific scavenger of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) diminished UgU-induced IL-1\u03b2 and caspase-1 activation. UgU induced Ca2+ mobilization, which was inhibited by treatment with inhibitors of PLC or inositol triphosphate receptor (IP3R). Blocking Ca2+ mobilization, PLC, or IP3R diminished UgU-induced IL-1\u03b2 release, caspase-1 activation, and mitochondrial ROS generation. These data demonstrated that UgU activated the NLPR3 inflammasome activation through Ca2+ mobilization and the production of mitochondrial ROS. We also demonstrated that UgU-dependent NLRP3 inflammasome activation enhanced the bactericidal function of human monocytes. The ability of UgU to stimulate human neutrophils and monocytes, both of which are professional phagocytes, and its capacity to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, which is a promising molecular target for developing anti-infective medicine, indicate that UgU treatment should be considered as a possible novel therapy for treating infectious diseases.",

The receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is involved in the progression of chronic diseases based on persistent inflammatory state and oxidative stress. RAGE is a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) and the inhibition of the interaction with its ligands or of the ligand accumulation have a potential therapeutic effect. The N-terminal domain of RAGE, the V domain, is the major site of AGEs binding and is stabilized by the adjacent C1 domain. In this study, we set up an affinity assay relying on the extremely specific biological interaction AGEs ligands have for the VC1 domain. A glycosylated form of VC1, produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris, was attached to magnetic beads and used as insoluble affinity matrix (VC1-resin). The VC1 interaction assay was employed to isolate specific VC1 binding partners from in vitro generated AGE-albumins and modifications were identified/localized by mass spectrometry analysis. Interestingly, this method also led to the isolation of ALEs produced by malondialdehyde treatment of albumins. Computational studies provided a rational-based interpretation of the contacts established by specific modified residues and amino acids of the V domain. The validation of VC1-resin in capturing AGE-albumins from complex biological mixtures such as plasma and milk, may lead to the identification of new RAGE ligands potentially involved in pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic responses, independently of their structures or physical properties, and without the use of any covalent derivatization process. In addition, the method can be applied to the identification of antagonists of RAGE-ligand interaction.",

     "abstract": "The cardioprotective benefits of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) are well established, although the regulatory role of ALDH2 in vascular remodeling in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is largely unknown. ALDH2 potently regulates the metabolism of aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), the endogenous product of lipid peroxidation. Thus, we hypothesized that ALDH2 ameliorates the proliferation and migration of human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (HPASMCs) by inhibiting 4-HNE accumulation and regulating downstream signaling pathways, thereby ameliorating pulmonary vascular remodeling. We found that low concentrations of 4-HNE (0.1 and 1\u00a0\u03bcM) stimulated cell proliferation by enhancing cyclin D1 and c-Myc expression in primary HPASMCs. Low 4-HNE concentrations also enhanced cell migration by activating the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway, thereby regulating matrix metalloprotein (MMP)-9 and MMP2 expression in vitro. In vivo, Alda-1, an ALDH2 agonist, significantly stimulated ALDH2 activity, reducing elevated 4-HNE and malondialdehyde levels and right ventricular systolic pressure in a monocrotaline-induced PAH animal model to the level of control animals. Our findings indicate that 4-HNE plays an important role in the abnormal proliferation and migration of HPASMCs, and that ALDH2 activation can attenuate 4-HNE-induced PASMC proliferation and migration, possibly by regulating NF-\u03baB activation, in turn ameliorating vascular remodeling in PAH. This mechanism might reflect a new molecular target for treating PAH.",

MitoQ is a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant that exerts protective effects in diabetic mice, but the mechanism underlying these effects is not clear. We demonstrated that mitochondrial abnormalities, such as defective mitophagy, mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) overexpression and mitochondrial fragmentation, occurred in the tubular cells of db/db mice, accompanied by reduced PINK and Parkin expression and increased apoptosis. These changes were partially reversed following an intraperitoneal injection of mitoQ. High glucose (HG) also induces deficient mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in HK-2 cells, changes that were reversed by mitoQ. Moreover, mitoQ restored the expression, activity and translocation of HG-induced NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and inhibited the expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein (Keap1), as well as the interaction between Nrf2 and Keap1. The reduced PINK and Parkin expression noted in HK-2 cells subjected to HG exposure was partially restored by mitoQ. This effect was abolished by Nrf2 siRNA and augmented by Keap1 siRNA. Transfection with Nrf2 siRNA or PINK siRNA in HK-2 cells exposed to HG conditions partially blocked the effects of mitoQ on mitophagy and tubular damage. These results suggest that mitoQ exerts beneficial effects on tubular injury in DKD via mitophagy and that mitochondrial quality control is mediated by Nrf2/PINK.",

     "abstract": "Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant flavanoid in green tea, is currently being evaluated in the clinic due to its benefits in the treatment of amyloid disorders. Its anti-amyloidogenic effect has been attributed to direct interaction of the intact molecule with misfolded polypeptides. In addition, antioxidant activity is also involved in the anti-amyloidogenic role. The detailed molecular mechanism is still unclear and requires further investigation. In the present study, the kinetics of EGCG oxidation and the anti-amyloidogenic effect of the resultant oxidation substances have been examined. The results indicate that EGCG degrades in a medium at pH 8.0 with a half-life less than 2\u00a0h. By utilizing lysozyme as an in vitro model, the oxidized EGCG demonstrates a more potent anti-amyloidogenic capacity than the intact molecule, as shown by ThT and ANS fluorescence, TEM determination, and hemolytic assay. The oxidized EGCG also has a stronger disruptive effect on preformed fibrils than the native form. Ascorbic acid eliminates the disruptive role of native EGCG on the fibrils, suggesting that oxidation is a prerequisite in fibril disruption. The results of this work demonstrate that oxidized EGCG plays a more important role than the intact molecule in anti-amyloidogenic activity. These insights into the action of EGCG may provide a novel route to understand the anti-amyloidogenic activity of natural polyphenols.",

     "abstract": "Activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is a pivotal event in liver fibrosis, characterized by dramatic disappearance of lipid droplets (LDs). Although LD disappearance has long been considered one of the hallmarks of HSC activation, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate the role of autophagy in the process of LD disappearance, and to further examine the underlying mechanisms in this molecular context. We found that LD disappearance during HSC activation was associated with a coordinate increase in autophagy. Inhibition or depletion of autophagy by Atg5 siRNA impaired LD disappearance of quiescent HSCs, and also restored lipocyte phenotype of activated HSCs. In contrast, induction of autophagy by Atg5 plasmid accelerated LD loss of quiescent HSCs. Importantly, our study also identified a crucial role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the facilitation of autophagy activation. Antioxidants, such as glutathione and N-acetyl cysteine, significantly abrogated ROS production, and in turn, prevented autophagosome generation and autophagic flux during HSC activation. Besides, we found that HSC activation triggered Rab25 overexpression, and promoted the combination of Rab25 and PI3KCIII, which direct autophagy to recognize, wrap and degrade LDs. Down-regulation of Rab25 activity, using Rab25 siRNA, blocked the target recognition of autophagy on LDs, and inhibited LD disappearance of quiescent HSCs. Moreover, the scavenging of excessive ROS could disrupt the interaction between autophagy and Rab25, and increase intracellular lipid content. Overall, these results provide novel implications to reveal the molecular mechanism of LD disappearance during HSC activation, and also identify ROS-Rab25-dependent autophagy as a potential target for the treatment of liver fibrosis.",

In addition, CC induce p300 tyrosine phosphorylation and activation in a BTK-dependent manner, which in turn, leads to STAT1 acetylation and its interaction with PPAR\u03b3 in CD36 expression, oxLDL uptake and foam cell formation. Furthermore, p300, STAT1 and PPAR\u03b3 bound to a STAT binding site at \u2212107 nt in CD36 promoter and enhanced its activity in ROS and BTK-dependent manner. Disruption of this STAT binding site by site-directed mutagenesis abolished CC-induced CD36 promoter activity.

Most studies about redox and aging focused on the static status of oxidative stress levels, there has been little research investigating differential responses to redox challenge during aging. In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans and human fibroblasts as models to compare differential responses to oxidative stress challenge in young and old individuals. In response to paraquat stress, young individuals generated more ROS and activated signaling pathways including p-ERK, p-AKT and p-AMPK\u03b1/\u03b2. After the initial response, young individuals then promoted NRF2 translocation and induced additional antioxidant enzymes and higher expression of phase II enzymes, including SOD, CAT, GPX, HO-1, GSTP-1and others, to maintain redox homeostasis. Moreover, young individuals also demonstrated a better ability to degrade damaged proteins by up-regulating the expression of chaperones and improving proteasome activity. Based on these data, we propose a new concept \"Redox-stress Response Capacity (RRC)\", which suggests cells or organisms are capable of generating dynamic redox responses to activate cellular signaling and maintain cellular homeostasis. The decay of RRC is the substantive characteristic of aging, which gives a new understand of the redox theory of aging.",

Bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein inhibitors have been shown to effectively ameliorate pathological fibrotic responses. However, the pharmacological effects and underlying mechanisms of these inhibitors in renal fibrosis remain elusive. In this study, we determined that the inhibition of Brd4, a BET family member, with a selective potent chemical inhibitor, JQ1, could prevent the development of renal fibrosis and block the progression of fibrosis in rats that have undergone unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Inhibiting Brd4 with either JQ1 or genetic knockdown resulted in decreased expression of fibrotic genes such as \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV and fibronectin both in UUO-induced fibrosis and upon TGF-\u03b21 stimulation in HK-2 cells. Brd4 inhibition also suppressed the oxidative stress induced by UUO in vivo or by TGF-\u03b21 in HK-2 cells. Moreover, Nox4, which is constitutively active in renal cells and is involved in the generation of hydrogen peroxide, was up-regulated during UUO-mediated fibrosis and induced by TGF-\u03b21 in HK-2 cells, and this up-regulation could be blunted by Brd4 inhibition. Consistently, Nox4-mediated ROS generation and fibrotic gene expression were attenuated upon Brd4 inhibition. Further, the transcriptional activity of Nox4 was suppressed by JQ1 or siRNA against Brd4. Additionally, Smad3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which are upstream signals of Nox4 expression, were inhibited both in JQ1-administered UUO rats and Brd4-inhibited HK-2 cells. In conclusion, these results indicated that the inhibition of Brd4 might protect against renal fibrosis by blocking the TGF-\u03b2-Nox4-ROS-fibrosis axis, suggesting that Brd4 could be a promising therapeutic target.",

     "abstract": "Human age-related diseases, including obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM), have long been associated to mitochondrial dysfunction; however, the role for adipose tissue mitochondria in these conditions remains unknown. We have tackled the impact of aging and T2DM on adipocyte mitochondria from obese patients by quantitating not only the corresponding abundance changes of proteins, but also the redox alterations undergone by Cys residues thereof. For that, we have resorted to a high-throughput proteomic approach based on isobaric labeling, liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The alterations undergone by the mitochondrial proteome revealed aging- and T2DM-specific hallmarks. Thus, while a global decrease of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) subunits was found in aging, the diabetic patients exhibited a reduction of specific OXPHOS complexes as well as an up-regulation of the anti-oxidant response. Under both conditions, evidence is shown for the first time of a link between increased thiol protein oxidation and decreased protein abundance in adipose tissue mitochondria. This association was stronger in T2DM, where OXPHOS mitochondrial- vs. nuclear-encoded protein modules were found altered, suggesting impaired mitochondrial protein translocation and complex assembly. The marked down-regulation of OXPHOS oxidized proteins and the alteration of oxidized Cys residues related to protein import through the redox-active MIA (Mitochondrial Intermembrane space Assembly) pathway support that defects in protein translocation to the mitochondria may be an important underlying mechanism for mitochondrial dysfunction in T2DM and physiological aging.

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder that is pathologically characterized by intracellular inclusions comprised primarily of alpha-synuclein (\u03b1Syn) that can also be transmitted from neuron to neuron. Several lines of evidence suggest that these inclusions cause neurodegeneration. Thus exploring strategies to improve neuronal survival in neurons with \u03b1Syn aggregates is critical. Previously, exposure to \u03b1Syn pre-formed fibrils (PFFs) has been shown to induce aggregation of endogenous \u03b1Syn resulting in cell death that is exacerbated by either starvation or inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin, both of which are able to induce autophagy, an intracellular protein degradation pathway. Since mTOR inhibition may also inhibit protein synthesis and starvation itself can be detrimental to neuronal survival, we investigated the effects of autophagy induction on neurons with \u03b1Syn inclusions by a starvation and mTOR-independent autophagy induction mechanism. We exposed mouse primary cortical neurons to PFFs to induce inclusion formation in the presence and absence of the disaccharide trehalose, which has been proposed to induce autophagy and stimulate lysosomal biogenesis. As expected, we observed that on exposure to PFFs, there was increased abundance of pS129-\u03b1Syn aggregates and cell death. Trehalose alone increased LC3-II levels, consistent with increased autophagosome levels that remained elevated with PFF exposure. Interestingly, trehalose alone increased cell viability over a 14-d time course. Trehalose was also able to restore cell viability to control levels, but PFFs still exhibited toxic effects on the cells. These data provide essential information regarding effects of trehalose on \u03b1Syn accumulation and neuronal survival on exposure to PFF.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) play an important role in the regulation of cardiac function. Increase in ROS/RNS concentration results in lipid and protein oxidation and is often associated with onset and/or progression of many cardiovascular disorders. However, interplay between lipid and protein modifications has not been simultaneously studied in detail so far. Biomolecule carbonylation is one of the most common biomarkers of oxidative stress. Using a dynamic model of nitroxidative stress we demonstrated rapid changes in biomolecule carbonylation in rat cardiomyocytes. Levels of carbonylated species increased as early as 15\u00a0min upon treatment with the peroxynitrite donor, 3-morpholinosydnonimine (SIN-1), and decreased to values close to control after 16\u00a0h. Total (lipids+proteins) vs. protein-specific carbonylation showed different dynamics, with a significant increase in protein-bound carbonyls at later time points. Treatment with SIN-1 in combination with inhibitors of proteasomal and autophagy/lysosomal degradation pathways allowed confirmation of a significant role of the proteasome in the degradation of carbonylated proteins, whereas lipid carbonylation increased in the presence of autophagy/lysosomal inhibitors. Electrophilic aldehydes and ketones formed by lipid peroxidation were identified and relatively quantified using LC-MS/MS. Molecular identity of reactive species was used for data-driven analysis of their protein targets. Combination of different enrichment strategies with LC-MS/MS analysis allowed identification of more than 167 unique proteins with 332 sites modified by electrophilic lipid peroxidation products. Gene ontology analysis of modified proteins demonstrated enrichment of several functional categories including proteins involved in cytoskeleton, extracellular matrix, ion channels and their regulation. Using calcium mobilization assays, the effect of nitroxidative stress on the activity of several ion channels was further confirmed.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Parkin (which encoded by Park2), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is the most frequently mutated gene that has casually been linked to autosomal recessive early onset familial PD. We tested the effect of Park2 on ethanol-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration in Park2 knockout (KO) transgenic mice after chronic ethanol feeding. Male Park2 wild type (WT) and KO mice (8 weeks old) were fed on a Lieber-DeCarli diet containing 6.6% ethanol for 2 weeks, and compared their responses. We found that knockout of Park2 exacerbates ethanol-induced behavioral impairment as well as dopamine depletion. In the mechanism study, we found that knockout of Park2 increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitophagy formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and expression of pro-apoptotic proteins, but decreased expression of pro-autophagic proteins. Knockout of Park2 also increased ethanol-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase. In addition, ROS production, mitophagy formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and expression of pro-apoptotic proteins were increased, but expression of pro-autophagic proteins were decreased by a treatment of ethanol (100\u00a0\u03bcM) in Park2 siRNA-transfacted PC12 cells (5\u00a0\u03bcM). Moreover, the exacerbating effects of Park2 deletion on ethanol-induced ROS generation, mitophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction as well as cell death were reduced by p38 specific inhibitor (SB203580) in in vitro (10\u00a0\u03bcM) and in vivo 10\u00a0mg/kg).

     "abstract": "Zinc deficiency affects the development of the central nervous system (CNS) through mechanisms only partially understood. We previously showed that zinc deficiency causes CNS oxidative stress, damaging microtubules and impairing protein nuclear shuttling. STAT1 and STAT3 transcription factors, which require nuclear import for their functions, play major roles in CNS development. Thus, we investigated whether zinc deficiency disrupts STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways in the developing fetal CNS, characterizing the involvement of oxidative stress and the cytoskeleton in the adverse effects. Maternal (gestation day 0\u201319) marginal zinc deficiency (MZD) reduced STAT1 and STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation and their nuclear translocation in the embryonic day 19 (E19) rat brain. Similar effects were observed in zinc depleted IMR-32 neuroblastoma cells, with an associated decrease in STAT1- and STAT3-dependent gene transactivation. Zinc deficiency caused oxidative stress (increased 4-hydroxynonenal-protein adducts) in E19 brain and IMR-32 cells, which was prevented in cells by supplementation with 0.5\u00a0mM \u03b1-lipoic acid (LA). In zinc depleted IMR-32 cells, the low tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, but not that of STAT3, recovered upon incubation with LA. STAT1 and STAT3 nuclear transports were also restored by LA. Accordingly, chemical disruption of the cytoskeleton partially reduced STAT1 and STAT3 nuclear levels. In summary, the redox-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, and oxidant-mediated disruption of the cytoskeleton are involved in the deleterious effects of zinc deficit on STAT1 and STAT3 activation and nuclear translocation. Therefore, disruption of the STAT1 and STAT3 signaling pathways may in part explain the deleterious effects of maternal MZD on fetal brain development.",

     "abstract": "The redox environment in cells and organisms is set by low-molecular mass and protein-bound thiols, with glutathione (GSH) representing a major intracellular redox buffer. Subtle thiol oxidation elicits signal transduction processes and adaptive responses to cope with stressors, whereas highly oxidizing conditions may provoke cell death. We here tested how thiol depletion affects life span, stress resistance and stress signaling in the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Diethyl maleate (DEM), an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compound that conjugates to GSH and other thiols, decreased C. elegans life span at a concentration of 1\u00a0mM. In contrast, low and moderate doses of DEM (10\u2013100\u00a0\u00b5M) increased mean and maximum life span and improved resistance against oxidative stress. DEM-induced life span extension was not detectable in worms deficient in either the FoxO orthologue, DAF-16, or the Nrf2 orthologue, SKN-1, pointing to a collaborative role of the two transcription factors in life span extension induced by thiol depletion. Cytoprotective target genes of DAF-16 and SKN-1 were upregulated after at least 3 days of exposure to 100\u00a0\u00b5M DEM, but not 1\u00a0mM DEM, whereas only 1\u00a0mM DEM caused upregulation of egl-1, a gene controlled by a p53-orthologue, CEP-1. In order to test whether depletion of GSH may elicit effects similar to DEM, we suppressed GSH biosynthesis in worms by attenuating \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gcs-1) expression through RNAi. The decline in GSH levels elicited by gcs-1 knockdown starting at young adult stage did not impair viability, but increased both stress resistance and life expectancy of the worms. In contrast, gcs-1 knockdown commencing right after hatching impaired nematode stress resistance and rendered young adult worms prone to vulval ruptures during egg-laying. Thus, modest decrease in GSH levels in young adult worms may promote stress resistance and life span, whereas depletion of GSH is detrimental to freshly hatched and developing worms.",

Extracellular hemoglobin and its degradation products, free heme and iron, are highly toxic due to oxidative stress induction and decrease in nitric oxide availability. We propose an approach that helps to eliminate extracellular hemoglobin toxicity in SCD by employing a bacterial protein system that evolved to extract heme from extracellular hemoglobin. NEAr heme Transporter (NEAT) domains from iron-regulated surface determinant proteins from Staphylococcus aureus specifically bind free heme as well as facilitate its extraction from hemoglobin. We demonstrate that a purified NEAT domain fused with human haptoglobin \u03b2-chain is able to remove heme from hemoglobin and reduce heme content and peroxidase activity of hemoglobin. We further use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to resolve molecular pathway of heme transfer from hemoglobin to NEAT, and to elucidate molecular mechanism of such heme transferring process. Our study is the first of its kind, in which simulations are employed to characterize the process of heme leaving hemoglobin and subsequent rebinding with a NEAT domain. Our MD results highlight important amino acid residues that facilitate heme transfer and will guide further studies for the selection of best NEAT candidate to attenuate free hemoglobin toxicity.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress causes endothelial death while underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, the pro-death effect of tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BHP) was investigated with low concentration (50\u00a0\u03bcM) of t-BHP (t-BHPL) and high concentration (500\u00a0\u03bcM) of t-BHP (t-BHPH). Both t-BHPL and t-BHPH induced endothelial cell death was determined. T-BHPL induced caspase-dependent apoptosis and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which was inhibited by N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Furthermore, NADPH oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), NOX4 siRNA, and NOX4 inhibitor GKT137831 reduced t-BHPL-induced ROS generation while mitochondrial respiratory chain inhibitors rotenone (Rot), 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), and antimycin A (AA) failed to do so. NOX4 overexpression resulted in increased ROS generation and Akt expression but decreased sensitivity to t-BHPL. In contrast, T-BHPH induced LDH release, PI uptake, and cell translucent cytoplasm. RIP1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), MLKL inhibitor necrosulfonamide (NSA) and silencing RIP1, RIP3, and MLKL inhibited t-BHPH-induced cell death while pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK showed no effect. T-BHPH-induced ROS production was inhibited by TTFA, AA and Rot while DPI showed no effect. T-BHPH induced RIP1/RIP3 interaction, which was decreased by Rot, TTFA, and AA. Silence RIP1 and RIP3 but not MLKL inhibited t-BHPH-induced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) decrease and ROS production. Moreover, P38MAPK inhibitor SB203580 reversed both t-BHPL and t-BHPH-induced cell death while inhibitors for ERKs and JNKs showed no obvious effect. These data suggested that t-BHP induced both apoptosis and necroptosis in endothelial cells which was mediated by ROS and p38MAPK.

CBD supplementation during reperfusion rescued OGD/R-induced cell death, attenuated intracellular ROS generation and lipid peroxidation, and simultaneously reversed the abnormal changes in antioxidant biomarkers. Using the Seahorse XFe24 Extracellular Flux Analyzer, we found that CBD significantly improved basal respiration, ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, and the spare respiratory capacity, and augmented glucose consumption in OGD/R-injured neurons. The activation of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and the preservation of the NADPH/NADP+ ratio implies that the pentose-phosphate pathway is stimulated by CBD, thus protecting hippocampal neurons from OGD/R injury. This study is the first to document the neuroprotective effects of CBD against OGD/R insult, which depend in part on attenuating oxidative stress, enhancing mitochondrial bioenergetics, and modulating glucose metabolism via the pentose-phosphate pathway, thus preserving both energy and the redox balance.",

     "abstract": "N-acetyl serotonin (NAS) as a melatonin precursor has neuroprotective actions. Nonetheless, it is not clarified how NAS protects neuronal cells against oxidative stress. Recently, we have reported that N-palmitoyl serotonins possessed properties of antioxidants and neuroprotection. Based on those, we hypothesized that NAS, a N-acyl serotonin, may have similar actions in oxidative stress-induced neuronal cells, and examined the effects of NAS based on in vitro and in vivo tests. NAS dose-dependently inhibited oxidative stress-induced cell death in HT-22 cells. Moreover, NAS suppressed glutamate-induced apoptosis by suppressing expression of AIF, Bax, calpain, cytochrome c and cleaved caspase-3, whereas it enhanced expression of Bcl-2. Additionally, NAS improved phosphorylation of tropomyosin-related kinase receptor B (TrkB) and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) as well as expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), whereas the inclusion of each inhibitor of JNK, p38 or Akt neutralized the neuroprotective effect of NAS, but not that of ERK. Meanwhile, NAS dose-dependently reduced the level of reactive oxygen species, and enhanced the level of glutathione in glutamate-treated HT-22 cells. Moreover, NAS significantly increased expression of heme oxygenase-1, NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase-1 and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit as well as nuclear translocation of NF-E2-related factor-2. Separately, NAS at 30\u00a0mg/kg suppressed scopolamine-induced memory impairment and cell death in CA1 and CA3 regions in mice. In conclusion, NAS shows actions of antioxidant and anti-apoptosis by activating TrkB/CREB/BDNF pathway and expression of antioxidant enzymes in oxidative stress-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, such effects of NAS may provide the information for the application of NAS against neurodegenerative diseases.",

Their lungs were analyzed by PET-CT scanning before radical surgical removal of the cancer. Specific immunohistochemistry for the major bioactive marker of lipid peroxidation, 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), was done for the malignant and surrounding non-malignant lung tissue using genuine monoclonal antibody specific for the HNE-histidine adducts.Both the intensity of the PET-CT analysis and the HNE-immunohistochemistry were in correlation with the size of the tumors analyzed, while primary lung carcinomas were larger than the metastatic tumors. The intensity of the HNE-immunohistochemistry in the surrounding lung tissue was more pronounced in the metastatic than in the primary tumors, but it was negatively correlated with the cancer volume determined by PET-CT. The appearance of HNE was more pronounced in non-malignant surrounding tissue than in cancer or stromal cells, both in case of primary and metastatic tumors.Both PET-CT and HNE-immunohistochemistry reflect the size of the malignant tissue. However, lipid peroxidation of non-malignant lung tissue in the vicinity of cancer is more pronounced in metastatic than in primary malignancies and might represent the mechanism of defense against cancer, as was recently revealed also in case of human liver cancer.",

Many chronic and age-related disorders are associated with down-regulation, or impairment, of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCL). This suggests that \u03b3-GC supply may become limiting for the maintenance of cellular GSH at the normal levels required to effectively protect against oxidative stress and any resulting physiological damage.GSH levels were measured in lymphocytes of healthy, non-fasting participants before and after single oral doses (2 and 4\u00a0g) of \u03b3-GC. Blood samples were immediately processed using high speed fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate 106 lymphocytes that were then assayed for GSH content.A single 2\u00a0g dose of \u03b3-GC increased lymphocyte GSH content above basal levels (53\u00b147%, p<0.01, n=14) within 90\u00a0min of administration. A randomized dosage (2 and 4\u00a0g \u03b3-GC) crossover design was used to explore the pharmacokinetics of this GSH increase. In general, for both dose levels (n=9), GSH increased from initial basal levels over 3\u00a0h (tmax) before reaching maximum GSH concentrations (Cmax) that were near two (2\u00a0g \u03b3-GC) to three (4\u00a0g \u03b3-GC) fold basal levels (0.4 nmol/106 lymphocytes). Beyond tmax, GSH levels progressively declined reaching near basal levels by 5\u00a0h. The GSH half-life was between 2 and 3\u00a0h with exposure (AUC) to increased GSH levels of 0.7 (2\u00a0g \u03b3-GC) and 1.8 (4\u00a0g \u03b3-GC) nmol.h/106 lymphocytes.Oral \u03b3-GC is a non-toxic form of cysteine that can be directly taken up by cells and transiently increase lymphocyte GSH above homeostatic levels. Our findings that \u03b3-GC can increase GSH levels in healthy subjects suggests that it may have potential as an adjunct for treating diseases associated with chronic GSH depletion.

We found that lowering the glucose concentration increased expression of genes coding for inducible nitric oxide syntheas, NOS2 and NOS2A resulting in enhanced production of nitric oxide. Surprisingly, AgNPs decreased the level of nitric oxide accelerated denitration of proteins nitrated by exogenous peroxynitrite in cells grown in the presence of lowered glucose concentration, apparently due to further induction of protective proteins.",

     "abstract": "We recently reported that knockdown of delta-5-desaturase (a key enzyme that converts dihomo-\u03b3-linolenic acid, DGLA, to the downstream \u03c9-6 arachidonic acid) promotes formation of an anti-cancer byproduct 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid from cyclooxygenase (COX)-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation. 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid can exert its growth inhibitory effect on cancer cells (e.g. colon and pancreatic cancer) by serving as a histone deacetylase inhibitor. Since histone deacetylase inhibitors have been well-known to suppress cancer cell migration and invasion, we thus tested whether knockdown of delta-5-desaturase and DGLA treatment could also be used to inhibit cancer migration and invasion of colon cancer and pancreatic cancer cells. Wound healing assay, transwell assay and western blot were used to assess cell migration and invasion as well as the associated molecular mechanisms. Formation of threshold level of 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid was quantified from COX-catalyzed DGLA peroxidation in the cancer cells that overexpress COX-2 and their delta-5-desaturases were knocked down by shRNA transfection. Our results showed that knockdown of delta-5-desaturase along with DGLA supplement not only significantly inhibited cell migration, but also improved the efficacies of 5-flurouracil and gemcitabine, two frontline chemotherapy drugs currently used in the treatment of colon and pancreatic cancer, respectively. The molecular mechanism behind these observations is that 8-hydroxyoctanoic acid inhibits histone deacetylase, resulting in downregulation of cancer metastasis promotors, e.g., MMP-2 and MMP-9 as well as upregulation of cancer metastasis suppressor, e.g. E-cadherin. For the first time, we demonstrated that we could take the advantage of the common phenomenon of COX-2 overexpression in cancers to inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion. With the shifting paradigm of COX-2 cancer biology, our research outcome may provide us a novel cancer treatment strategy.",

These lipids comprise the majority of DXA3 generated by platelets, are formed in ng amounts (24.3\u00b16.1\u00a0ng/2\u00d7108) and remain membrane bound. Pharmacological studies revealed DXA3-PE formation involves cyclooxygenase-1 (COX), protease-activated receptors (PAR) 1 and 4, cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2), phospholipase C and intracellular calcium. They are generated primarily via esterification of newly formed DXA3, but can also be formed in vitro via co-oxidation of PE during COX-1 co-oxidation of arachidonate. All four DXA3-PEs were detected in human clots. Purified platelet DXA3-PE activated neutrophil Mac-1 expression, independently of its hydrolysis to the free eicosanoid. This study demonstrates the structures and cellular synthetic pathway for a family of leukocyte-activating platelet phospholipids generated on acute activation, adding to the growing evidence that enzymatic PE oxidation is a physiological event in innate immune cells.",

The hypothesis exists that mitochondria are involved in the formation of lipofuscin, an autofluorescent protein aggregate that accumulates progressively over time in lysosomes of post-mitotic and senescent cells. To investigate the influence and involvement of mitochondria in lipofuscinogenesis, we analyzed lipofuscin amounts as well as the mitochondrial function in young and senescent cells. In addition we used an aging model and Lon protease deficient HeLa cells to investigate the influence of mitochondrial degradation processes on lipofuscin formation.We were able to show that mitophagy is impaired in senescent cells resulting in an increased mitochondrial mass and superoxide formation. In addition, the inhibition of mitochondrial fission leads to increased lipofuscin formation.Moreover, we observed that Lon protease downregulation is linked to a higher lipofuscinogenesis whereas the application of the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO is able to prevent the accumulation of this protein aggregate.",

     "abstract": "The objective of the present study is to characterize the metabolic and antioxidant profile of white muscle of shi drum in two sites of the body, anterior dorsal (AM) and posterior dorsal (PM) portions. In addition, it will be analyzed the possible effect of starvation and a subsequent refeeding, with two different protocols, pair feeding and ad libitum. Activities of key enzymes of intermediary metabolism and of antioxidant enzymes, as well as lipid peroxidation, as an index of oxidative stress, were evaluated. The results indicate the existence of a regional asymmetry of the metabolic capacities of the white muscle of shi drum, which is likely related to the different contribution to swimming of the body regions examined. Starvation induces a metabolic depression that is more marked in those activities that support burst swimming in PM, while those activities supporting maintenance requirements are conserved. The greatest energy demands during starvation appear to lie in AM, which showed the highest oxidative metabolism rate. The increased use of fatty acids as energy source for AM leads to oxidative stress. A period of more than four weeks of refeeding for full restoration of metabolic capacities in AM is needed, probably related to the higher muscle mass located in this region. On the contrary, all enzyme activities in PM returned to control levels in both refeeding protocols, but pair feeding seems to be advantageous since compensatory growth has been taking place without signs of oxidative stress. This work was addressed to gain knowledge on the physiology of a promising fish species in aquaculture like shi drum. The results displayed here show how the starving and further re-feeding events could generate oxidative stress situations characterized by high lipid peroxidation levels which may influence negatively on the quality of the edible part of the fish. This study opens an interesting field on this fish species which deserves being investigated in the future.",

     "abstract": "Thioredoxins (Trxs), key components of cellular redox regulation, act by controlling the redox status of many target proteins, and have been shown to play an essential role in cell survival and growth. The presence of a Trx system in the nucleus has received little attention in plants, and the nuclear targets of plant Trxs have not been conclusively identified. Thus, very little is known about the function of Trxs in this cellular compartment. Previously, we studied the intracellular localization of PsTrxo1 and confirmed its presence in mitochondria and, interestingly, in the nucleus under standard growth conditions. In investigating the nuclear function of PsTrxo1 we identified proliferating cellular nuclear antigen (PCNA) as a PsTrxo1 target by means of affinity chromatography techniques using purified nuclei from pea leaves. Such protein\u2013protein interaction was corroborated by dot-blot and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays, which showed that both proteins interact in the nucleus. Moreover, PsTrxo1 showed disulfide reductase activity on previously oxidized recombinant PCNA protein. In parallel, we studied the effects of PsTrxo1 overexpression on Tobacco Bright Yellow-2 (TBY-2) cell cultures. Microscopy and flow-cytometry analysis showed that PsTrxo1 overexpression increases the rate of cell proliferation in the transformed lines, with a higher percentage of the S phase of the cell cycle at the beginning of the cell culture (days 1 and 3) and at the G2/M phase after longer times of culture (day 9), coinciding with an upregulation of PCNA protein. Furthermore, in PsTrxo1 overexpressed cells there is a decrease in the total cellular glutathione content but maintained nuclear GSH accumulation, especially at the end of the culture, which is accompanied by a higher mitotic index, unlike non-overexpressing cells. These results suggest that Trxo1 is involved in the cell cycle progression of TBY-2 cultures, possibly through its link with cellular PCNA and glutathione.",

Chronic administration of aspartame increased plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase activities and caused liver injury as well as marked decreased hepatic levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), \u03b3-glutamylcysteine (\u03b3-GC), and most metabolites of the trans-sulphuration pathway, such as cysteine, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). Aspartame also triggered a decrease in mRNA and protein levels of the catalytic subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLc) and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase, and in protein levels of methionine adenosyltransferase 1A and 2A. N-acetylcysteine prevented the aspartame-induced liver injury and the increase in plasma ALT activity as well as the decrease in GSH, \u03b3-GC, cysteine, SAM and SAH levels and GCLc protein levels. In conclusion, chronic administration of aspartame caused marked hepatic GSH depletion, which should be ascribed to GCLc down-regulation and decreased cysteine levels. Aspartame triggered blockade of the trans-sulphuration pathway at two steps, cystathionine \u03b3-lyase and methionine adenosyltransferases. NAC restored glutathione levels as well as the impairment of the trans-sulphuration pathway.",

     "abstract": "H2O2-producing lactobacilli in the vaginal fluid have been suggested to play a potential tumor-preventive role in addition to the control of undesirable microorganisms. As the vaginal fluid also contains a significant concentration of peroxidase that might utilize lactobacilli-derived H2O2 as substrate for HOCl synthesis, a dominant biological role of HOCl in both natural defence systems has been postulated.Our study shows that lactobacillus-derived H2O2 per se is not likely to be beneficial for the vaginal epithelium, as it causes apoptosis nonselectively in nontransformed as well as transformed cells. However, the combination of lactobacilli and peroxidase, i.e. the situation that is actually found in vivo, leads to the conversion of H2O2 to HOCl which does not affect non-malignant cells, as these do not generate extracellular superoxide anions. In contrast, malignant cells, due to their abundant extracellular superoxide anion generation allow the generation of apoptosis-inducing hydroxyl radicals through HOCl/superoxide anion interaction. In total, our data show that the combination of H2O2 -generating lactobacilli and peroxidase causes the selective elimination of malignant cells and thus might contribute to the tumorpreventive potential of lactobacilli. These findings are in good agreement with epidemiological data. The contribution of lactobacilli in this system can be completely mimicked by H2O2-generating glucose oxidase, indicating that it is fully explained by bacterial generation of H2O2.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS), a by-product of aerobic metabolism were initially studied in context to their damaging effect but recent decades witnessed significant advancements in understanding the role of ROS as signaling molecules. Contrary to earlier views, it is becoming evident that ROS production is not necessarily a symptom of cellular dysfunction but it might represent a necessary signal in adjusting the cellular machinery according to the altered conditions. Stomatal movement is controlled by multifaceted signaling network in response to endogenous and environmental signals. Furthermore, the stomatal aperture is regulated by a coordinated action of signaling proteins, ROS-generating enzymes, and downstream executors like transporters, ion pumps, plasma membrane channels, which control the turgor pressure of the guard cell. The earliest hallmarks of stomatal closure are ROS accumulation in the apoplast and chloroplasts and thereafter, there is a successive increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ level which rules the multiple kinases activity that in turn regulates the activity of ROS-generating enzymes and various ion channels. In addition, ROS also regulate the action of multiple proteins directly by oxidative post translational modifications to adjust guard cell signaling. Notwithstanding, an active progress has been made with ROS signaling mechanism but the regulatory action for ROS signaling processes in stomatal movement is still fragmentary. Therefore, keeping in view the above facts, in this mini review the basic concepts and role of ROS signaling in the stomatal movement have been presented comprehensively along with recent highlights.",

     "abstract": "The liver has a multitude of functions which are necessary to maintain whole body homeostasis. This requires that various metabolic pathways can run in parallel in the most efficient manner and that futile cycles are kept to a minimum. To a large extent this is achieved due to a functional specialization of the liver parenchyma known as metabolic zonation which is often lost in liver diseases. Although this phenomenon is known for about 40 years, the underlying regulatory pathways are not yet fully elucidated. The physiologically occurring oxygen gradient was considered to be crucial for the appearance of zonation; however, a number of reports during the last decade indicating that \u03b2-catenin signaling, and the hedgehog (Hh) pathway contribute to metabolic zonation may have shifted this view. In the current review we connect these new observations with the concept that the oxygen gradient within the liver acinus is a regulator of zonation. This is underlined by a number of facts showing that the \u03b2-catenin and the Hh pathway can be modulated by the hypoxia signaling system and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs). Altogether, we provide a view by which the dynamic interplay between all these pathways can drive liver zonation and thus contribute to its physiological function.",

Earlier studies argued for cytochrome P450-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) during APAP metabolism, which resulted in massive lipid peroxidation and subsequent liver injury. However, subsequent studies convincingly challenged this assumption and the current paradigm suggests that mitochondria are the main source of ROS, which impair mitochondrial function and are responsible for cell signaling resulting in cell death. Although immune cells can be a source of ROS in other models, no reliable evidence exists to support a role for immune cell-derived ROS in APAP hepatotoxicity. Recent studies suggest that mitochondrial targeted antioxidants can be viable therapeutic agents against hepatotoxicity induced by APAP overdose, and re-purposing existing drugs to target oxidative stress and other concurrent signaling events can be a promising strategy to increase its potential application in patients with APAP overdose.",

Increasing evidence indicates that Nrf2 signaling plays a key role in how oxidative stress mediates the beneficial effects of exercise. Episodic increases in oxidative stress induced through bouts of acute exercise stimulate Nrf2 activation and when applied repeatedly, as with regular exercise, leads to upregulation of endogenous antioxidant defenses and overall greater ability to counteract the damaging effects of oxidative stress. The evidence of Nrf2 activation in response to exercise across variety of tissues may be an important mechanism of how exercise exerts its well-known systemic effects that are not limited to skeletal muscle and myocardium.

Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), a new family of oxidized protein compounds, have been considered as a novel marker of oxidative stress. However, the role of AOPPs in the mechanism of hyperalgesia remains unknown. Our study aims to investigate whether AOPPs have an effect on hyperalgesia and the possible underlying mechanisms. To identify the AOPPs involved, we induced hyperalgesia in rats by injecting complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant (CFA) in hindpaw. The level of plasma AOPPs in CFA-induced rats was 1.6-fold in comparison with what in normal rats (P<0.05). After intravenous injection of AOPPs-modified rat serum albumin (AOPPs-RSA) in Sprague-Dawley rats, the paw mechanical thresholds, measured by the electronic von Frey system, significantly declined. Immunofluorescence staining indicated that AOPPs increased expressions of NADPH oxidase 1 (Nox1), NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) tissues. In-vitro studies were performed on primary DRG neurons which were obtained from both thoracic and lumbar DRG of rats. Results indicated that AOPPs triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in DRG neurons, which were significantly abolished by ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and small-interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of Nox1 or Nox4. The expressions of Nox1, Nox4, TRPV1 and CGRP were significantly increased in AOPPs-induced DRG neurons. And relevant siRNA or inhibitors notably suppressed the expressions of these proteins and the calcium influxes in AOPPs-induced DRG neurons. In conclusion, AOPPs increased significantly in CFA-induced hyperalgesia rats and they activated Nox1/Nox4-ROS to sensitize TRPV1-dependent Ca2+ influx and CGRP release which led to inducing mechanical hyperalgesia.",

In contrast, \u201calternatively activated\u201d macrophages adopt a metabolic program dominated by fatty acid-fueled OXPHOS. Despite the known importance of these developmental stages on the qualitative aspects of an inflammatory response, relatively little is know regarding the regulation of these metabolic adjustments. Here we provide evidence that the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 defines a metabolic regulatory loop. Our data show for the first time that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced glycolytic flux controls IL-10-production via regulation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and that autocrine IL-10 in turn regulates macrophage nitric oxide (NO) production. Genetic and pharmacological manipulation of IL-10 and nitric oxide (NO) establish that metabolically regulated autocrine IL-10 controls glycolytic commitment by limiting NO-mediated suppression of OXPHOS. Together these data support a model where autocine IL-10 production is controlled by glycolytic flux in turn regulating glycolytic commitment by preserving OXPHOS via suppression of NO. We propose that this IL-10-driven metabolic rheostat maintains metabolic equilibrium during M1 macrophage differentiation and that perturbation of this regulatory loop, either directly by exogenous cellular sources of IL-10 or indirectly via limitations in glucose availability, skews the cellular metabolic program altering the balance between inflammatory and immunosuppressive phenotypes.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a gradually debilitating disease that leads to dementia. The molecular mechanisms underlying AD are still not clear, and at present no reliable biomarkers are available for the early diagnosis. In the last several years, together with oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, altered cholesterol metabolism in the brain has become increasingly implicated in AD progression. A significant body of evidence indicates that oxidized cholesterol, in the form of oxysterols, is one of the main triggers of AD. The oxysterols potentially most closely involved in the pathogenesis of AD are 24-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, respectively deriving from cholesterol oxidation by the enzymes CYP46A1 and CYP27A1. However, the possible involvement of oxysterols resulting from cholesterol autooxidation, including 7-ketocholesterol and 7\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol, is now emerging. In a systematic analysis of oxysterols in post-mortem human AD brains, classified by the Braak staging system of neurofibrillary pathology, alongside the two oxysterols of enzymatic origin, a variety of oxysterols deriving from cholesterol autoxidation were identified; these included 7-ketocholesterol, 7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol, 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol, 5\u03b1,6\u03b1-epoxycholesterol, and 5\u03b2,6\u03b2-epoxycholesterol. Their levels were quantified and compared across the disease stages. Some inflammatory mediators, and the proteolytic enzyme matrix metalloprotease-9, were also found to be enhanced in the brains, depending on disease progression. This highlights the pathogenic association between the trends of inflammatory molecules and oxysterol levels during the evolution of AD. Conversely, sirtuin 1, an enzyme that regulates several pathways involved in the anti-inflammatory response, was reduced markedly with the progression of AD, supporting the hypothesis that the loss of sirtuin 1 might play a key role in AD. Taken together, these results strongly support the association between changes in oxysterol levels and AD progression.",

An LC50 for each age group was established, which showed that aging resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in susceptibility to menadione (LC50 for young: 405\u00a0\u03bcM; LC50 for old: 275\u00a0\u03bcM). Examination of the known Nrf2-regulated pathways associated with menadione detoxification revealed, surprisingly, that NAD(P)H: quinone oxido-reductase 1 (NQO1) protein levels and activity were induced 9-fold and 4-fold with age, respectively (p=0.0019 and p=0.018; N=3), but glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) declined by 70% (p=0.0043; N=3). These results indicate toxicity may stem from vulnerability to lipid peroxidation instead of inadequate reduction of menadione semi-quinone. Lipid peroxidation was 2-fold higher, and GSH declined by a 3-fold greater margin in old versus young rat cells given 300\u00a0\u00b5M menadione (p<0.05 and p\u22640.01 respectively; N=3). We therefore provided 400\u00a0\u00b5M\u00a0N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) to hepatocytes from old rats before menadione exposure to alleviate limits in cysteine substrate availability for GSH synthesis during challenge.

     "abstract": "In the context of global change, there is an urgent need for researchers in conservation physiology to understand the physiological mechanisms leading to the acquisition of stress acclimation phenotypes. Intertidal organisms continuously cope with drastic changes in their environmental conditions, making them outstanding models for the study of physiological acclimation. As the implementation of such processes usually comes at a high bioenergetic cost, a mitochondrial/oxidative stress approach emerges as the most relevant approach when seeking to analyze whole-animal responses. Here we use the intertidal flatworm Macrostomum lignano to analyze the bioenergetics of salinity acclimation and its consequences in terms of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species formation and physiological response to counteract redox imbalance. Measures of water fluxes and body volume suggest that M. lignano is a hyper-/iso-regulator. Higher salinities were revealed to be the most energetically expensive conditions, with an increase in mitochondrial density accompanied by increased respiration rates. Such modifications came at the price of enhanced superoxide anion production, likely associated with a high caspase 3 upregulation. These animals nevertheless managed to live at high levels of environmental salinity through the upregulation of several mitochondrial antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase. Contrarily, animals at low salinities decreased their respiration rates, reduced their activity and increased nitric oxide formation, suggesting a certain degree of metabolic arrest. A contradictory increase in dichlorofluorescein fluorescence and an upregulation of gluthathione-S-transferase pi 1 (GSTP1) expression were observed in these individuals. If animals at low salinity are indeed facing metabolic depression, the return to seawater may result in an oxidative burst. We hypothesize that this increase in GSTP1 could be a \u201cpreparation for oxidative stress\u201d, i.e. a mechanism to counteract the production of free radicals upon returning to seawater.

Monocyte and platelet maximal capacity correlated with maximal oxidative phosphorylation capacity of permeabilized skeletal muscle (R=0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.38\u20130.97; R=0.51, 95%CI: 0.05\u20130.81; respectively), isolated skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiratory control ratio (RCR; R=0.70, 95%CI: 0.35\u20130.89; R=0.64, 95%CI: 0.23\u20130.98; respectively), and isolated cardiac muscle mitochondrial RCR (R=0.55, 95%CI: 0.22\u20130.86; R=0.58, 95%CI: 0.22\u20130.85; respectively).

     "abstract": "Mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) has emerged as a new potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer. Rapamycin and rapamycin analogs are undergoing clinical trials and have produced clinical responses in a subgroup of cancer patients. However, monotherapy with rapamycin at safe dosage fails to induce cell apoptosis and tumor regression which has hampered its clinical application. This has led to the exploration of more effective combinatorial regimens to enhance the effectiveness of rapamycin. In our present study, we have investigated the combination of rapamycin and a reactive oxygen species (ROS) inducer EF24 in gastric cancer. We show that rapamycin increases intracellular ROS levels and displays selective synergistic antitumor activity with EF24 in gastric cancer cells. This activity was mediated through the activation of c-Jun N terminal kinase and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER) pathways in cancer cells. We also show that inhibiting ROS accumulation reverses ER stress and prevents apoptosis induced by the combination of rapamycin and EF24. These mechanisms were confirmed using human gastric cancer xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Taken together, our work provides a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer. The work reveals that ROS generation could be an important target for the development of new combination therapies for cancer treatment.",

The present results showed that ABZ causes oxidative cleavage on calf-thymus DNA suggesting that this compound can break DNA. ABZ treatment decreased MCF-7 cell viability (EC50=44.9 for 24\u00a0h) and inhibited MCF-7 colony formation (~67.5% at 5\u00a0\u03bcM). Intracellular ROS levels increased with ABZ treatment (~123%). The antioxidant NAC is able to revert the cytotoxic effects, ROS generation and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential of MCF-7 cells treated with ABZ. Ehrlich carcinoma growth was inhibited (~32%) and survival time was elongated (~50%) in animals treated with ABZ. Oxidative biomarkers (TBARS and protein carbonyl levels) and activity of antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD and GR) increased, and reduced glutathione (GSH) was depleted in animals treated with ABZ, indicating an oxidative stress condition, leading to a DNA damage causing phosphorylation of histone H2A variant, H2AX, and triggering apoptosis signaling, which was confirmed by increasing Bax/Bcl-xL rate, p53 and Bax expression. We propose that ABZ induces oxidative stress promoting DNA fragmentation and triggering apoptosis and inducing cell death, making this drug a promising leader molecule for development of new antitumor drugs.",

     "abstract": "Damage to renal tubular and mesangial cells is central to the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN), a complication of diabetes which can lead to renal failure. Mitochondria are the site of cellular respiration and produce energy in the form of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in DN. Since the kidney is an organ with high bioenergetic needs, we postulated that hyperglycemia causes damage to renal mitochondria resulting in bioenergetic deficit. The bioenergetic profiles and the effect of hyperglycemia on cellular respiration of human primary mesangial (HMCs) and proximal tubular cells (HK-2) were compared in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions using the seahorse bio-analyzer. In normoglycemia, HK-2 had significantly lower basal, ATP-linked and maximal respiration rates, and lower reserve capacity compared to HMCs. Hyperglycemia caused a down-regulation of all respiratory parameters within 4 days in HK-2 but not in HMCs. After 8 days of hyperglycemia, down-regulation of respiratory parameters persisted in tubular cells with compensatory up-regulated glycolysis. HMCs had reduced maximal respiration and reserve capacity at 8 days, and by 12 days had compromised mitochondrial respiration despite which they did not enhance glycolysis. These data suggest that diabetes is likely to lead to a cellular deficit in ATP production in both cell types, although with different sensitivities, and this mechanism could significantly contribute to the cellular damage seen in the diabetic kidney. Prevention of diabetes induced damage to renal mitochondrial respiration may be a novel therapeutic approach for the prevention/treatment of DN.",

Our previous work found that hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) preconditioning significantly protected rats from SCI after stimulated diving, and in vitro study further testified that HBO protected primary cultured rat spinal neurons from oxidative insult and oxygen glucose deprivation injury via heat shock protein (HSP) 32 induction. In this study, underlying molecular mechanisms were further investigated. The results showed that a single exposure to HBO significantly increased intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) and activated MEK1/2, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, CREB, Bach1 and Nrf2. The induction of HSP32 by HBO was significantly reversed by pretreatment neurons with ROS scavenger N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, p38 MAPK inhibitor or Nrf2 gene knockdown, enhanced by MEK1/2 inhibitors or gene knockdown but not by ERK1/2 inhibitor. CREB knockdown did not change the expression of HSP32 induced by HBO. N-Acetyl-L-cysteine significantly inhibited the activation of MEK1/2, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and Nrf2. Activation of Nrf2 was significantly inhibited by p38 MAPK inhibitor and the nuclear export of Bach1 was significantly enhanced by MEK1/2 inhibitor. The results demonstrated that HBO induces HSP32 expression through a ROS/p38 MAPK/Nrf2 pathway and the MEK1/2/Bach1 pathway contributes to negative regulation in the process. More importantly, as we know, this is the first study to delineate that ERK1/2 is not the only physiological substrates of MEK1/2.",

However, the exact mechanisms are still unclear. Here we investigated the role of S-nitrosation or altered expression of NOX subunits, and the role of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) in nitrite-derived nitric oxide (NO) production.Mouse macrophages were activated with LPS in the presence or absence of nitrite. NOX activity was measured by lucigenin-dependent chemiluminescence. Gene and protein expression of NOX2 subunits and XOR were investigated using qPCR and Western Blot. S-nitrosation of Nox2 and p22phox was studied with a Biotin Switch assay. Uric acid levels in cell culture medium were analyzed as a measure of XOR activity, and NO production was assessed by DAF-FM fluorescence.NOX activity in activated macrophages was significantly reduced by nitrite. Reduced NOX activity was not attributed to decreased NOX gene expression. However, protein levels of p47phox and p67phox subunits were reduced by nitrite in activated macrophages. Protein expression of Nox2 and p22phox was not influenced by this treatment and neither was their S-nitrosation status. Increased uric acid levels after nitrite and diminished NO production during XOR-inhibition with febuxostat suggest that XOR is more active during nitrite-treatment of activated macrophages and plays an important role in the bioactivation of nitrite.Our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding about the therapeutic effects associated with nitrite supplementation in many diseases. We show that nitrite-mediated inhibition of NOX activity cannot be explained by S-nitrosation of the NOX enzyme, but that changes in NOX2 expression and XOR function may contribute.",

     "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is one of the most common retinal degenerative conditions affecting people worldwide, and is currently incurable. It is characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors, in which the death of rod cells leads to the secondary death of cone cells; the cause of eventual blindness. As rod cells die, retinal-oxygen metabolism becomes perturbed, leading to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and thus oxidative stress; a key factor in the secondary death of cones. In this study, norgestrel, an FDA-approved synthetic analog of progesterone, was found to be a powerful neuroprotective antioxidant, preventing light-induced ROS in photoreceptor cells, and subsequent cell death. Norgestrel also prevented light-induced photoreceptor morphological changes that were associated with ROS production, and that are characteristic of RP. Further investigation showed that norgestrel acts via post-translational modulation of the major antioxidant transcription factor Nrf2; bringing about its phosphorylation, subsequent nuclear translocation, and increased levels of its effector protein superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2). In summary, these results demonstrate significant protection of photoreceptor cells from oxidative stress, and underscore the potential of norgestrel as a therapeutic option for RP.",

For this, male Wistar rats (200\u2013350\u00a0g) had their cecum punctured once (non-transfixing hole) with a 14-gauge needle. Performed in this way, a mortality rate around 30% was achieved in the first 72\u00a0h. The survivors, together with age-matched control rats (not subjected to CLP), were maintained in our holding room for 60 days (S60 group) and had the descending thoracic aorta processed for functional, histological, biochemical or molecular analyses. Endothelium-intact aortic rings obtained from sepsis-surviving S60 group displayed increased angiotensin II-induced contraction, accompanied by decreased activity of the endogenous superoxide dismutase, augmented reactive oxygen species generation, and increased levels of tyrosine nitration compared with vessels from control group. The superoxide scavengers superoxide dismutase and tempol, and the antioxidant apocynin, were able to avoid this enhanced contractility to angiotensin II in aortic rings from the S60 group. In addition, aortic rings from the S60 group presented reduced sensitivity to Y-27632, a Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor. Immunoblot analyses revealed augmented RhoA and ROCK II, and high levels of phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 in vessels from S60 rats. In conclusion, aortic rings from sepsis-surviving rats display endothelial dysfunction mediated by the increased production of reactive oxygen species, which in turn reduces the bioavailability of nitric oxide and increases the formation of peroxynitrite, and enhances RhoA-ROCK-mediated calcium sensitization, leading to augmented contractile responses to angiotensin II.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third physiological gasotransmitter, is well recognized as an anti-inflammatory mediator in various inflammatory conditions. Herein, we explored the protective effects of S-propargyl-cysteine (SPRC, also known as ZYZ-802), an endogenous H2S modulator, on RA and determined the underlying mechanisms. In the present study, SPRC concentration-dependently attenuated inflammatory mediator expression, reactive oxidase species generation, and the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 in interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2-induced human rheumatoid fibroblast-like synoviocytes MH7A. In addition, SPRC blocked IL-1\u03b2-mediated migration and invasion of MH7A cells. As expected, the protective effects of SPRC were partially abrogated by DL-propargylglycine (PAG, a H2S biosynthesis inhibitor). In vivo study also demonstrated that SPRC treatment markedly ameliorated the severity of RA in adjuvant-induced arthritis rats, and this effect was associated with the inhibition of inflammatory response. We further identified that SPRC remarkably induced heme oxygenase-1 expression associated with the degradation of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2); this effect was attributed to the sulfhydrylation of the cysteine residue of Keap1.

Biomarkers were validated using aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN) rats at week 24, adenine-induced chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats and CKD patients.

Taurine, a conditionally essential amino acid, possesses multiple roles in the brain as a neuromodulator or antioxidant. In this study, to explore the roles of taurine in PS-induced learning and memory impairment, prenatal restraint stress was set up and Morris water maze (MWM) was employed for testing the cognitive function in the one-month-old rat offspring. The mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) level\uff0cmitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), ATP and cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) activity and apoptosis-related proteins in the hippocampus were detected. The activity of the Akt-cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor\u2013\u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC1\u03b1) pathway in the hippocampus was measured. The results showed that high dosage of taurine administration in the early postnatal period attenuated impairment of spatial learning and memory induced by PS. Meanwhile, taurine administration diminished the increase in mitochondrial ROS, and recovered the reduction of MMP, ATP level and the activities of CcO, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) and catalase induced by PS in the hippocampus. In addition, taurine administration recovered PS-suppressed SOD2 expression level. Taurine administration blocked PS-induced decrease in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and increase in the ratio of cleaved caspase-3/full-length caspase-3. Notably, taurine inhibited PS-decreased phosphorylation of Akt (pAkt) and phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB), which consequently enhanced the mRNA and protein levels of PGC1\u03b1. Taken together, these results suggest that high dosage of taurine administration during the early postnatal period can significantly improve the cognitive function in prenatally stressed juvenile rats via activating the Akt-CREB-PGC1\u03b1 pathway. Therefore, taurine has therapeutic potential for prenatal stressed offspring rats in future.",

     "abstract": "In humans dietary circulating nitrate accumulates rapidly in saliva through active transport in the salivary glands. By this mechanism resulting salivary nitrate concentrations are 10\u201320 times higher than in plasma. In the oral cavity nitrate is reduced by commensal bacteria to nitrite, which is subsequently swallowed and further metabolized to nitric oxide (NO) and other bioactive nitrogen oxides in blood and tissues. This entero-salivary circulation of nitrate is central in the various NO-like effects observed after ingestion of inorganic nitrate. The very same system has also been the focus of toxicologists studying potential carcinogenic effects of nitrite-dependent nitrosamine formation. Whether active transport of nitrate and accumulation in saliva occurs also in rodents is not entirely clear. Here we measured salivary and plasma levels of nitrate and nitrite in humans, rats and mice after administration of a standardized dose of nitrate.After oral (humans) or intraperitoneal (rodents) sodium nitrate administration (0.1\u00a0mmol/kg), plasma nitrate levels increased markedly reaching ~300\u00a0\u00b5M in all three species. In humans ingestion of nitrate was followed by a rapid increase in salivary nitrate to >6000\u00a0\u00b5M, ie 20 times higher than those found in plasma. In contrast, in rats and mice salivary nitrate concentrations never exceeded the levels in plasma. Nitrite levels in saliva and plasma followed a similar pattern, ie marked increases in humans but modest elevations in rodents. In mice there was also no accumulation of nitrate in the salivary glands as measured directly in whole glands obtained after acute administration of nitrate.This study suggests that in contrast to humans, rats and mice do not actively concentrate circulating nitrate in saliva. These apparent species differences should be taken into consideration when studying the nitrate-nitrite-nitric oxide pathway in rodents, when calculating doses, exploring physiological, therapeutic and toxicological effects and comparing with human data.",

     "abstract": "Clinical and experimental observations indicate a critical role for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), secreted by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), in pathological angiogenesis and the development of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). RPE-mediated VEGF expression, leading to angiogenesis, is a major signaling mechanism underlying ocular neovascular disease. Inhibiting this signaling pathway with a therapeutic molecule is a promising anti-angiogenic strategy to treat this disease with potentially fewer side effects. Oxalomalate (OMA) is a competitive inhibitor of NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), which plays an important role in cellular signaling pathways regulated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we have investigated the inhibitory effect of OMA on the expression of VEGF, and the associated underlying mechanism of action, using in vitro and in vivo RPE cell models of AMD. We found that OMA reduced the expression and secretion of VEGF in RPE cells, and consequently inhibited CNV formation. This function of OMA was linked to its capacity to activate the pVHL-mediated HIF-1\u03b1 degradation in these cells, partly via a ROS-dependent ATM signaling axis, through inhibition of IDH enzymes. These findings reveal a novel role for OMA in inhibiting RPE-derived VEGF expression and angiogenesis, and suggest unique therapeutic strategies for treating pathological angiogenesis and AMD development.",

     "abstract": "Selenium participates in the antioxidant defense mainly through a class of selenoproteins, including thioredoxin reductase. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is the most abundant and biologically active catechin in green tea. Depending upon the dose and biological systems, EGCG may function either as an antioxidant or as an inducer of antioxidant defense via its pro-oxidant action or other unidentified mechanisms. By manipulating the selenium status, the present study investigated the interactions of EGCG with antioxidant defense systems including the thioredoxin system comprising of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, the glutathione system comprising of glutathione and glutathione reductase coupled with glutaredoxin, and the Nrf2 system. In selenium-optimal mice, EGCG increased hepatic activities of thioredoxin reductase, glutathione reductase and glutaredoxin. These effects of EGCG appeared to be not due to overt pro-oxidant action because melatonin, a powerful antioxidant, did not influence the increase. However, in selenium-deficient mice, with low basal levels of thioredoxin reductase 1, the same dose of EGCG did not elevate the above-mentioned enzymes; intriguingly EGCG in turn activated hepatic Nrf2 response, leading to increased heme oxygenase 1 and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 protein levels and thioredoxin activity. Overall, the present work reveals that EGCG is a robust inducer of the Nrf2 system only in selenium-deficient conditions. Under normal physiological conditions, in selenium-optimal mice, thioredoxin and glutathione systems serve as the first line defense systems against the stress induced by high doses of EGCG, sparing the activation of the Nrf2 system.",

The aim of this investigation was to elucidate the potential role of ortho-dihydroxy group containing natural compounds in H2O2-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. For this purpose, the main phenolic alcohols of olive oil, namely hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were examined for their ability to protect cultured cells under conditions of oxidative stress. A strong correlation was observed between the ability of hydroxytyrosol to mitigate intracellular labile iron level and the protection offered against H2O2-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. On the other hand, tyrosol, which lacks the ortho-dihydroxy group, was ineffective. Moreover, hydroxytyrosol (but not tyrosol), was able to diminish the late sustained phase of H2O2-induced JNK and p38 phosphorylation. The derangement of intracellular iron homeostasis, following exposure of cells to H2O2, played pivotal role both in the induction of DNA damage and the initiation of apoptotic signaling. The presented results suggest that the protective effects exerted by ortho-dihydroxy group containing dietary compounds against oxidative stress-induced cell damage are linked to their ability to influence changes in the intracellular labile iron homeostasis.",

Oxidative damage is a significant contributor to perturbation of proteostasis and is dealt with by the cell through regulation of antioxidants, protein degradation, and repair of oxidized amino acids. Methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) repairs oxidation of free- and protein-bound methionine residues through enzymatic reduction and is found in both the cytosol and the mitochondria. Previous studies in Drosophila have shown that increasing expression of MsrA can extend longevity. Here we test the effects of increasing MsrA on longevity and healthy aging in two transgenic mouse models. We show that elevated expression of MsrA targeted specifically to the cytosol reduces the rate of age-related death in female mice when assessed by Gompertz analysis. However, neither cytosolic nor mitochondrial MsrA overexpression extends lifespan when measured by log-rank analysis. In mice with MsrA overexpression targeted to the mitochondria, we see evidence for improved insulin sensitivity in aged female mice. With these and our previous data, we conclude that the increasing MsrA expression in mice has differential effects on aging and healthy aging that are dependent on the target of its subcellular localization.",

     "abstract": "Cisplatin-induced ototoxicity remains a primary dose-limiting adverse effect of this highly effective anticancer drug. The clinical utility of cisplatin could be enhanced if the signaling pathways that regulate the toxic side-effects are delineated. In previous studies, we reported cisplatin-induced nitration of cochlear proteins and provided the first evidence for nitration and downregulation of cochlear LIM domain only 4 (LMO4) in cisplatin ototoxicity. Here, we extend these findings to define the critical role of nitrative stress in cisplatin-induced downregulation of LMO4 and its consequent ototoxic effects in UBOC1 cell cultures derived from sensory epithelial cells of the inner ear and in CBA/J mice. Cisplatin treatment increased the levels of nitrotyrosine and active caspase 3 in UBOC1 cells, which was detected by immunocytochemical and flow cytometry analysis, respectively. The cisplatin-induced nitrative stress and apoptosis were attenuated by co-treatment with SRI110, a peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst (PNDC), which also attenuated the cisplatin-induced downregulation of LMO4 in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, transient overexpression of LMO4 in UBOC1 cells prevented cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity while repression of LMO4 exacerbated cisplatin-induced cell death, indicating a direct link between LMO4 protein levels and cisplatin ototoxicity. Finally, auditory brainstem responses (ABR) recorded from CBA/J mice indicated that co-treatment with SRI110 mitigated cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Together, these results suggest that cisplatin-induced nitrative stress leads to a decrease in the levels of LMO4, downregulation of LMO4 is a critical determinant in cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, and targeting peroxynitrite could be a promising strategy for mitigating cisplatin-induced hearing loss.",

Rate constants for removal of H2O2 (kcell) and catalase activities were determined for 15 tumor and 10 normal cell lines of various tissue types. A differential in the capacity of cells to remove H2O2 was revealed, with the average kcell for normal cells being twice that of tumor cells. The ED50 (50% clonogenic survival) of P-AscH\u2212 correlated directly with kcell and catalase activity.

Because of the complex equilibria that exist between components in culture media, the donor compound and NO itself, it is very challenging to predict the dose and duration of NO cells actually experience. To determine the actual level of NO experienced by cells exposed to soluble NO donors, we developed the CellNO Trap, a device that allows continuous, real-time monitoring of the level of NO adherent cells produce and/or experience in culture without the need to alter cell culturing procedures. Herein, we directly measured the level of NO that cells grown in the CellNO Trap experienced when soluble NO donors were added to solutions in culture wells and we characterized environmental conditions that effected the level of NO in in vitro culture conditions. Specifically, the dose and duration of NO generated by the soluble donors S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO) and the diazeniumdiolate diethyltriamine (DETA/NO) were investigated in both phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and cell culture media. Other factors that were studied that potentially affect the ultimate NO level achieved with these donors included pH, presence of transition metals (ion species), redox level, presence of free thiol and relative volume of media. Then murine smooth muscle cell (MOVAS) with different NO donors but with the same effective concentration of available NO were examined and it was demonstrated that the cell proliferation ratio observed does not correlate with the half-lives of NO donors characterized in PBS, but does correlate well with the real-time NO profiles measured under the actual culture conditions. This data demonstrates the dynamic characteristic of the NO and NO donor in different biological systems and clearly illustrates the importance of tracking individual NO profiles under the actual biological conditions.",

Unlike Txnrd1- and Trsp-deficient mice, Gpx4\u2212/\u2212 mice died shortly after birth and presented extensive hepatocyte degeneration. Similar to Txnrd1-deficient livers, Gpx4\u2212/\u2212 livers manifested upregulation of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived)-like 2 (Nrf2) response genes. Remarkably, Gpx4\u2212/\u2212 pups born from mothers fed a vitamin E-enriched diet survived, yet this protection was reversible as subsequent vitamin E deprivation caused death of Gpx4-deficient mice ~4 weeks thereafter. Abrogation of selenoprotein expression in Gpx4\u2212/\u2212 mice did not result in viable mice, indicating that the combined deficiency aggravated the loss of Gpx4 in liver. By contrast, combined Trsp/Txnrd1-deficient mice were born, but had significantly shorter lifespans than either single knockout, suggesting that Txnrd1 plays an important role in supporting liver function of mice lacking Trsp. In sum our study demonstrates that the ferroptosis regulator Gpx4 is critical for hepatocyte survival and proper liver function, and that vitamin E can compensate for its loss by protecting cells against deleterious lipid peroxidation.",

     "abstract": "Simvastatin reduces the blood concentration of cholesterol by inhibiting hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis, and thereby reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, simvastatin treatment leads to a reduction in fluxes in mitochondrial respiratory complexes I and II and might thereby reduce the formation of reactive oxygen species, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis. Therefore, we hypothesized that simvastatin may reduce oxidative stress in humans in vivo.We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study in which subjects were treated with either 40\u00a0mg of simvastatin or placebo for 14 days. The endpoints were six biomarkers for oxidative stress, which represent intracellular oxidative stress to nucleic acids, lipid peroxidation and plasma antioxidants, that were measured in urine and plasma samples.A total of 40 participants were included, of which 39 completed the trial. The observed differences between simvastatin and placebo groups in the primary outcomes, DNA and RNA oxidation, were small and nonsignificant (p=0.68), specifically, 3% in the simvastatin group compared to 7.1% in the placebo group for DNA oxidation and 7.3% in the simvastatin group compared to 3.4% in the placebo group. The differences in biomarkers related to plasma were not statistically significant between the treatments groups, with the exception of total vitamin E levels, which, as expected, were reduced in parallel with the reduction in plasma cholesterol.In healthy young male volunteers, short-term simvastatin treatment, which considerably reduces cholesterol, does not lead to a clinically relevant reduction in a panel of measures of oxidative stress. Whether simvastatin has effects on oxidative stress in diseased populations, such as diabetes or hemochromatosis, where oxidative stress is prominent, is unknown but seems unlikely.",

In our laboratory we used mouse embryonic fibroblasts (undifferentiated cells: CC), which are capable of differentiating into mature adipocytes (differentiated cells: DC) and accumulate lipids, as obesity model. Here we analyzed the role of the well-known antioxidant and glutathione precursor N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in cellular MAPK modulation and lipid accumulation. We evaluated the effect of NAC on the adipogenic differentiation pathway using different doses: 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 5\u00a0mM; no toxic doses in these cells. A dose of 5\u00a0mM NAC [DCN-5] provoked a significant decrease in triglyceride accumulation (72\u00b110 [DCN-5] vs 169\u00b115 [DC], p<0.01), as well in Oil Red O stained neutral lipid content (120\u00b12 [DCN-5] vs 139\u00b112 [DC], p<0.01). Molecular mechanisms responsible for adipogenic differentiation involve increase of the expression of phosphoERK\u00bd and phosphoJNK, 5\u00a0mM NAC treatment inhibited both pERK\u00bd and pJNK protein levels. We also evaluated the mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) which takes place during adipogenesis and observed an increase in DC at a rate of 1.5 cells number compared to CC at day 2, whereas the highest doses of NAC significantly inhibited MCE. Our results suggest that NAC inhibits lipid accumulation and the MAPK phosphorylation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts during adipogenic differentiation and further contribute to probe the importance of cellular redox environment in adipogenesis.",

In this study, we utilized a rapid, simple and reliable method for simultaneous determination of several thiol-containing amino acids in plasma using HPLC with electrochemical detection in kainic acid (KA) and pilocarpine rat models of epilepsy. In contrast to GSH and GSSG levels, the levels of cysteine (Cys) were decreased by 42% and 62% and cystine (Cyss) were increased by 46% and 23% in the plasma of KA- and pilocarpine-injected rats, respectively after 48\u00a0h. In chronically epileptic rats, plasma cysteine was decreased by 40.4% and 37.7%, and plasma GSSG increased by 33.8% and 35.0% following KA and pilocarpine, respectively. Treatment of rats with a catalytic antioxidant, 60\u00a0min after KA or pilocarpine significant attenuated the decrease of plasma Cys/Cyss ratios at the 48\u00a0h time point in both models.

Further study showed that Artemisinin significantly suppressed H2O2\u2212 induced D407 cell death by restoring abnormal changes in nuclear morphology, intracellular ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic biomarkers.

     "abstract": "Metabolic control of cellular function is significant in the context of inflammation-induced metabolic dysregulation in immune cells. Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide are one of the critical events that modulate the immune response in neutrophils. When activated, neutrophil NADPH oxidases consume large quantities of oxygen to rapidly generate ROS, a process that is referred to as the oxidative burst. These ROS are required for the efficient removal of phagocytized cellular debris and pathogens. In chronic inflammatory diseases, neutrophils are exposed to increased levels of oxidants and pro-inflammatory cytokines that can further prime oxidative burst responses and generate lipid oxidation products such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). In this study we hypothesized that since 4-HNE can target glycolysis then this could modify the oxidative burst. To address this the oxidative burst was determined in freshly isolated healthy subject neutrophils using 13-phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and the extracellular flux analyzer. Neutrophils pretreated with 4-HNE exhibited a significant decrease in the oxidative burst response and phagocytosis. Mass spectrometric analysis of alkyne-HNE treated neutrophils followed by click chemistry detected modification of a number of cytoskeletal, metabolic, redox and signaling proteins that are critical for the NADPH oxidase mediated oxidative burst. These modifications were confirmed using a candidate immunoblot approach for critical proteins of the active NADPH oxidase enzyme complex (Nox2 gp91phox subunit and Rac1 of the NADPH oxidase) and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase, a critical enzyme in the metabolic regulation of oxidative burst. Taken together, these data suggest that 4-HNE-induces a pleiotropic mechanism to inhibit neutrophil function. These mechanisms may contribute to the immune dysregulation associated with chronic pathological conditions where 4-HNE is generated.",

Therefore the impact of TNF-\u03b1 on basal control of redox signaling events needs to be understand in more depth. This is particularly important for the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in the heart and in the present study we hypothesized that inhibition of a low level of TNF-\u03b1 signaling attenuates the TNF-\u03b1 dependent activation of this cytoprotective pathway. HL-1 cardiomyocytes and TNF receptor1/2 (TNFR1/2) double knockout mice (DKO) were used as experimental models. TNF-\u03b1 (2\u20135\u00a0ng/ml, for 2\u00a0h) evoked significant nuclear translocation of Nrf2 with increased DNA/promoter binding and transactivation of Nrf2 targets. Additionally, this was associated with a 1.5 fold increase in intracellular glutathione (GSH). Higher concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 (>10\u201350\u00a0ng/ml) were markedly suppressive of the Keap1/Nrf2 response and associated with cardiomyocyte death marked by an increase in cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP. In vivo experiments with TNFR1/2-DKO demonstrates that the expression of Nrf2-regulated proteins (NQO1, HO-1, G6PD) were significantly downregulated in hearts of the DKO when compared to WT mice indicating a weakened antioxidant system under basal conditions. Overall, these results indicate that TNF-\u03b1 exposure has a bimodal effect on the Keap1/Nrf2 system and while an intense inflammatory activation suppresses expression of antioxidant proteins a low level appears to be protective.",

Characterization of this pathway has extended to fish, most notably zebrafish (Danio rerio), in which two paralogs of the transcription factor exist: Nrf2a, an activator, and Nrf2b, a negative regulator during embryogenesis. Only one ARE target has been thoroughly delineated in zebrafish, and this deviated from the canonical sequence derived from studies in mammals. In general, the mechanistic pathway has not been characterized in non-model aquatic organisms that are commonly exposed to environmental pollutants. The current study compares the zebrafish paralogs to those found in a non-model teleost, the ecologically important salmonid, Oncorhnychus kisutch (coho salmon). Two salmon paralogs, Nrf2A and -2B, described here were found to possess only slightly greater identity between one another (84% of amino acids) than to the singleton ortholog of the esocid Esox lucius (80\u201382%), the nearest non-salmonid outgroup. Unlike one of the zebrafish forms, each is a strong activating factor based on sequence homology and in vitro testing. To uncover functional target AREs in coho, promoter flanking sequences were isolated for five genes that protect cells against oxidative stress: heme oxygenase 1, peroxiredoxin 1, glutamate-cysteine ligase, and the glutathione S-transferases pi and rho (hmox1, prdx1, gclc, gstp, and gstr). All except gstr had functional elements and all fit the standard mammalian-derived canonical sequence, unlike the motif found in zebrafish gstp. Expression studies demonstrate the presence of both Nrf2 paralogs in multiple organs, although in differing ratios. Collectively, our findings extend the conservation of Nrf2 and the ARE to salmonids, and should help inform future work in teleosts on mechanisms of redox control, as well as responsiveness of this pathway and its downstream antioxidant gene targets to chemical exposures in the environment.",

Thus, cells are constantly exposed to diverse types of genotoxic insults that challenge genome stability, including those that induce oxidative DNA damage. However, most in vitro studies that model cellular response to oxidative stressors employ short exposures and/or acute stress models. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that chronic and repeated exposure to a micromolar concentration of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) could activate DNA damage responses, resulting in cellular adaptations. For this purpose, we developed an in vitro model in which we incubated mouse myoblast cells with a steady concentration of ~50\u00a0\u03bcM H2O2 for one hour daily for seven days, followed by a final challenge of a 10 or 20X higher dose of H2O2 (0.5 or 1\u00a0mM). We report that intermittent long-term exposure to this oxidative stimulus nearly eliminated cell toxicity and significantly decreased genotoxicity (in particular, a >5-fold decreased in double-strand breaks) resulting from subsequent acute exposure to oxidative stress. This protection was associated with cell cycle arrest in G2/M and induction of expression of nine DNA repair genes. Together, this evidence supports an adaptive response to chronic, low-level oxidative stress that results in genomic protection and up-regulated maintenance of cellular homeostasis.",

While PPIs increase asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels and inhibit nitric oxide production, it is unknown whether impaired vascular redox biology resulting of increased xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) activity mediates PPIs-induced endothelial dysfunction (ED). We examined whether increased XOR activity impairs vascular redox biology and causes ED in rats treated with omeprazole. We also examined whether omeprazole aggravates the ED found in hypertension. Treatment with omeprazole reduced endothelium-dependent aortic responses to acetylcholine without causing hypertension. However, omeprazole did not aggravate two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) hypertension, nor hypertension-induced ED. Omeprazole and 2K1C increased vascular oxidative stress as assessed with dihydroethidium (DHE), which reacts with superoxide, and by the lucigenin chemiluminescence assay. The selective XOR inhibitor febuxostat blunted both effects induced by omeprazole. Treatment with omeprazole increased plasma ADMA concentrations, XOR activity and systemic markers of oxidative stress. Incubation of aortic rings with ADMA increased XOR activity, DHE fluorescence and lucigenin chemiluminescence signals, and febuxostat blunted these effects. Providing functional evidence that omeprazole causes ED by XOR-mediated mechanisms, we found that febuxostat blunted the ED caused by omeprazole treatment. This study shows that treatment with omeprazole impairs the vascular redox biology by XOR-mediated mechanisms leading to ED. While omeprazole did not further impair hypertension-induced ED, further studies in less severe animal models are warranted.

In vitro permeability was evaluated using albumin flux and transendothelial electrical resistance. Different H2S donors were used to examine the effects of exogenous H2S. To evaluate the role of endogenous H2S, mouse aortic endothelial cells (MAECs) were isolated from wild type mice and mice lacking cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE), a predominant source of H2S in endothelial cells. In vivo permeability was evaluated using the Miles assay. We observed that polysulfide donors induced rapid albumin flux across endothelium. Comparatively, free sulfide donors increased permeability only with higher concentrations and at later time points. Increased solute permeability was associated with disruption of endothelial junction proteins claudin 5 and VE-cadherin, along with enhanced actin stress fiber formation. Importantly, sulfide donors that increase permeability elicited a preferential increase in polysulfide levels within endothelium. Similarly, CSE deficient MAECs showed enhanced solute barrier function along with reduced endogenous bound sulfane sulfur. CSE siRNA knockdown also enhanced endothelial junction structures with increased claudin 5 protein expression. In vivo, CSE genetic deficiency significantly blunted VEGF induced hyperpermeability revealing an important role of the enzyme for barrier function. In summary, endothelial solute permeability is critically regulated via exogenous and endogenous sulfide bioavailability with a prominent role of polysulfides.",

     "abstract": "Cell-free heme (CFH) and hemoglobin (Hb) have emerged as distinct mediators of acute injury characterized by inflammation and microcirculatory dysfunction in hemolytic conditions and critical illness. Several reports have shown changes in Hb and CFH in specific pathophysiological settings. Using PBS, plasma from patients with sickle cell disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients and supernatants from red cells units, we found that commonly used assays and commercially available kits do not distinguish between CFH and Hb. Furthermore, they suffer from a variety of false-positive interferences and limitations (including from bilirubin) that lead to either over- or underestimation of CFH and/or Hb. Moreover, commonly used protocols to separate CFH and Hb based on molecular weight (MWt) are inefficient due to CFH hydrophobicity. In this study, we developed and validated a new approach based on absorbance spectrum deconvolution with least square fitting analyses that overcomes these limitations and simultaneously measures CFH and Hb in simple aqueous buffers, plasma or when associated with red cell derived microvesicles. We show how incorporating other plasma factors that absorb light over the visible wavelength range (specifically bilirubin), coupled with truncating the wavelength range analyzed, or addition of mild detergent significantly improves fits allowing measurement of oxyHb, CFH and metHb with >90% accuracy. When this approach was applied to samples from SCD patients, we observed that CFH levels are higher than previously reported and of similar magnitude to Hb.",

However, the function of UCP2 in astrocytes and the contribution of astrocytic UCP2 to depression remain undefined. Herein, we demonstrated that UCP2 knockout (KO) mice displayed aggravated depressive-like behaviors, impaired neurogenesis, and enhanced loss of astrocytes in the chronic mild stress (CMS)-induced anhedonia model of depression. We further found that UCP2 ablation significantly enhanced the activation of the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the hippocampus and in astrocytes. Furthermore, UCP2 deficiency promoted the injury of mitochondria, the generation of ROS and the physical association between thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) and NLRP3 in astrocytes. Moreover, transiently expressing exogenous UCP2 partially rescued the deleterious effects of UCP2 ablation on the astrocytes. These data indicate that UCP2 negatively regulates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and inhibited the ROS-TXNIP-NLRP3 pathway in astrocytes. Collectively, our findings reveal that UCP2 regulates inflammation responses in astrocytes and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression and that UCP2 may be a promising therapeutic target for depression.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and bioenergetic stress play an important role in the etiology of alcoholic liver disease. Previous studies from our laboratory show that the primary methyl donor S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM) minimizes alcohol-induced disruptions in several mitochondrial functions in the liver. Herein, we expand on these earlier observations to determine whether the beneficial actions of SAM against alcohol toxicity extend to changes in the responsiveness of mitochondrial respiration to inhibition by nitric oxide (NO), induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) pore, and the hypoxic state of the liver.For this, male Sprague-Dawley rats were pair-fed control and alcohol-containing liquid diets with and without SAM for 5 weeks and liver hypoxia, mitochondrial respiration, MPT pore induction, and NO-dependent control of respiration were examined.Chronic alcohol feeding significantly enhanced liver hypoxia, whereas SAM supplementation attenuated hypoxia in livers of alcohol-fed rats. SAM supplementation prevented alcohol-mediated decreases in mitochondrial state 3 respiration and cytochrome c oxidase activity. Mitochondria isolated from livers of alcohol-fed rats were more sensitive to calcium-mediated MPT pore induction (i.e., mitochondrial swelling) than mitochondria from pair-fed controls, whereas SAM treatment normalized sensitivity for calcium-induced swelling in mitochondria from alcohol-fed rats. Liver mitochondria from alcohol-fed rats showed increased sensitivity to NO-dependent inhibition of respiration compared with pair-fed controls. In contrast, mitochondria isolated from the livers of SAM treated alcohol-fed rats showed no change in the sensitivity to NO-mediated inhibition of respiration.Collectively, these findings indicate that the hepato-protective effects of SAM against alcohol toxicity are mediated, in part, through a mitochondrial mechanism involving preservation of key mitochondrial bioenergetic parameters and the attenuation of hypoxic stress.",

     "abstract": "Connexin (Cx) hemichannels regulate many cellular processes with little information available regarding their mechanisms. Given that many pathological factors that activate hemichannels also disrupts the integrity of cellular junctions, we speculated a potential participation of hemichannels in the regulation of cell junctions. Here we tested this hypothesis. Exposure of renal tubular epithelial cells to Ca2+-free medium led to disassembly of tight and adherens junctions, as indicated by the reduced level of ZO-1 and cadherin, disorganization of F-actin, and severe drop in transepithelial electric resistance. These changes were preceded by an activation of Cx43 hemichannels, as revealed by extracellular efflux of ATP and intracellular influx of Lucifer Yellow. Inhibition of hemichannels with chemical inhibitors or Cx43 siRNA greatly attenuated the disassembly of cell junctions. Further analysis using fetal fibroblasts derived from Cx43 wide-type (Cx43+/+), heterozygous (Cx43+/-) and knockout (Cx43-/-) littermates showed that Cx43-positive cells (Cx43+/+) exhibited more dramatic changes in cell shape, F-actin, and cadherin in response to Ca2+ depletion, as compared to Cx43-null cells (Cx43-/-). Consistently, these cells had higher level of protein carbonyl modification and phosphorylation, and much stronger activation of P38 and JNK. Hemichannel opening led to extracellular loss of the major antioxidant glutathione (GSH). Supplement of cells with exogenous GSH or inhibition of oxidative sensitive kinases largely prevented the above-mentioned changes. Taken together, our study indicates that Cx43 hemichannels promote the disassembly of cell junctions through regulation of intracellular oxidative status.",

Of particular interest are lipid peroxidation products, which are involved in the activation of Nrf2 and endocannabinoids that affect cancer progression.In lung cancer tissues (squamous cell lung carcinoma - SCC and adenocarcinoma - AC), the glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity and glutathione level, together with the expression of Nrf2 and its activators/inhibitors were estimated. The oxidative modifications of DNA (8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine and N7-methylguanine), endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2- arachidonylglyceriol), their receptors (CB1/2, TRV1, GPR55), phospholipid fatty acids (arachidonic, linoleic and docosahexaenoic), and reactive aldehydes (4-hydroxynonenal, 4-oxononenal and malondialdehyde) were determined.Tumour tissues showed lower antioxidant capacity than healthy tissues, which was accompanied by lower levels of fatty acids and higher levels of reactive aldehydes. Disturbances in antioxidant capacity and enhanced DNA oxidative modifications were observed in 88% of AC patients and 81% of SCC patients. The 4-hydroxynonenal-Histidine adducts were detected in the necrotic and stromal cells in all tumours. These findings were associated with the enhanced Nrf2 activity, especially in AC. The strong difference between the cancer subtypes was evident in the levels of endocannabinoids, with an increase in 89% of SCC and a decrease in 85% of AC patients being observed. Additionally, the increase in the expression of CB1/2 receptors was observed only in 82% of AC, while the expression of VR1 and GPR55 was enhanced in 79% of SCC and 82% of AC patients.This study shows significant differences in the redox status, Nrf2 pathway and endocannabinoid system between SCC and AC tissues.

     "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction due to vascular inflammation and oxidative stress critically contributes to the etiology of atherosclerosis. The intracellular redox environment plays a key role in regulating endothelial cell function and is intimately linked to cellular thiol status, including and foremost glutathione (GSH). In the present study we investigated whether and how the dietary flavonoid, quercetin, affects GSH status of human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) and their response to oxidative stress. We found that treating cells with buthionine sulfoximine to deplete cellular GSH levels significantly reduced the capacity of quercetin to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced oxidant production. Furthermore, incubation of HAEC with quercetin caused a transient decrease and then full recovery of cellular GSH concentrations. The initial decline in GSH was not accompanied by a corresponding increase in glutathione disulfide (GSSG). To the contrary, GSSG levels, which were less than 0.5% of GSH levels at baseline (0.26\u00b10.01 vs. 64.7\u00b11.9\u00a0nmol/mg protein, respectively), decreased by about 25% during incubation with quercetin. As a result, the GSH: GSSG ratio increased by about 70%, from 253\u00b17 to 372\u00b123. These quercetin-induced changes in GSH and GSSG levels were not affected by treating HAEC with 500\u00a0\u00b5M ascorbic acid phosphate for 24\u00a0h to increase intracellular ascorbate levels. Incubation of HAEC with quercetin also led to the appearance of extracellular quercetin-glutathione conjugates, which was paralleled by upregulation of the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1). Furthermore, quercetin slightly but significantly increased mRNA and protein levels of glutamate-cysteine ligase (GCL) catalytic and modifier subunits. Taken together, our results suggest that quercetin causes loss of GSH in HAEC, not because of oxidation but due to formation and cellular export of quercetin-glutathione conjugates. Induction by quercetin of GCL subsequently restores GSH levels, thereby suppressing LPS-induced oxidant production.",

     "abstract": "Studying rats fed high cholesterol diet and a pancreatic \u03b2-cell line (Min6), we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which quercetin protects against cholesterol-induced pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction and impairments in glycemic control. Quercetin prevented the increase in total plasma cholesterol, but only partially prevented the high cholesterol diet-induced alterations in lipid profile. Quercetin prevented cholesterol-induced decreases in pancreatic ATP levels and mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction in Min6 cells, including decreases in mitochondrial membrane potentials and coupling efficiency in the mitochondrial respiration (basal and maximal oxygen consumption rate (OCR), ATP-linked OCR and reserve capacity). Quercetin protected against cholesterol-induced apoptosis of Min6 cells by inhibiting caspase-3 and -9 activation and cytochrome c release. Quercetin prevented the cholesterol-induced decrease in antioxidant defence enzymes from pancreas (cytosolic and mitochondrial homogenates) and Min6 cells and the cholesterol-induced increase of cellular and mitochondrial oxidative status and lipid peroxidation. Quercetin counteracted the cholesterol-induced activation of the NF\u03baB pathway in the pancreas and Min6 cells, normalizing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Quercetin inhibited the cholesterol-induced decrease in sirtuin 1 expression in the pancreas and pancreatic \u03b2-cells. Taken together, the anti-apoptotic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of quercetin, and its ability to protect and improve mitochondrial bioenergetic function are likely to contribute to its protective action against cholesterol-induced pancreatic \u03b2-cell dysfunction, thereby preserving glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) and glycemic control. Specifically, the improvement of ATP-linked OCR and the reserve capacity are important mechanisms for protection of quercetin. In addition, the inhibition of the NF\u03baB pathway is an important mechanism for the protection of quercetin against cytokine mediated cholesterol-induced glycemic control impairment. In summary, our data highlight cellular, molecular and bioenergetic mechanisms underlying quercetin's protective effects on \u03b2-cells in vitro and in vivo, and provide a scientifically tested foundation upon which quercetin can be developed as a nutraceutical to preserve \u03b2-cell function.",

     "abstract": "Anthocyanins are a class of phytochemicals that have generated considerable interest due to their reported health benefits. It has been proposed that commonly consumed anthocyanins, such as cyandin-3-O-\u03b2-glucoside (C3G), confer cellular protection by stimulating biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH), an endogenous antioxidant. Currently, it is unknown whether the health effects of dietary anthocyanins are genetically determined. We therefore tested the hypothesis that anthocyanin-induced alterations in GSH homeostasis vary by genetic background. Mice representing five genetically diverse inbred strains (A/J, 129S1/SvImJ, CAST/EiJ, C57BL/6J, and NOD/ShiLtJ) were assigned to a control or 100\u00a0mg/kg C3G diet (n=5/diet/strain) for six weeks. GSH and GSSG levels were quantified in liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, and brain samples using HPLC. The C3G diet promoted an increase in renal GSH concentrations, hepatic GSH/GSSG, and cardiac GSH/GSSG in CAST/EiJ mice. C3G treatment also induced an increase in pancreatic GSH/GSSG in C57BL/6J mice. In contrast, C3G did not affect GSH homeostasis in NOD/ShiLtJ mice. Surprisingly, the C3G-diet caused a decrease in hepatic GSH/GSSG in A/J and 129S1/SvImJ mice compared to controls; C3G-treated 129S1/SvImJ mice also exhibited lower total glutathione in the heart. Overall, we discovered that C3G modulates the GSH system in a strain- and tissue-specific manner. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show that the redox effects of anthocyanins are determined by genetic background.",

     "abstract": "Inhalation of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) during their manufacture or incorporation into various commercial products may cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress in exposed workers. Some workers may be more susceptible to these effects because of differences in their ability to synthesize the major antioxidant and immune system modulator glutathione (GSH). Accordingly, in this study we examined the influence of GSH synthesis and gender on MWCNT-induced lung inflammation in C57BL/6 mice. GSH synthesis was impaired through genetic manipulation of Gclm, the modifier subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase, the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis. Twenty-four hours after aspirating 25\u00a0\u00b5g of MWCNTs, all male mice developed neutrophilia in their lungs, regardless of Gclm genotype. However, female mice with moderate (Gclm heterozygous) and severe (Gclm null) GSH deficiencies developed significantly less neutrophilia. We found no indications of MWCNT-induced oxidative stress as reflected in the GSH content of lung tissue and epithelial lining fluid, 3-nitrotyrosine formation, or altered mRNA or protein expression of several redox-responsive enzymes. Our results indicate that GSH-deficient female mice are rendered uniquely susceptible to an attenuated neutrophil response. If the same effects occur in humans, GSH-deficient women manufacturing MWCNTs may be at greater risk for impaired neutrophil-dependent clearance of MWCNTs from the lung. In contrast, men may have effective neutrophil-dependent clearance, but may be at risk for lung neutrophilia regardless of their GSH levels.",

     "abstract": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal skeletal muscle wasting disease presenting with excessive myofibre necrosis and increased inflammation and oxidative stress. In the mdx mouse model of DMD, homeostasis of the amino acid taurine is altered, and taurine administration drastically decreases muscle necrosis, dystropathology, inflammation and protein thiol oxidation. Since the severe pathology of the Golden Retriever Muscular Dystrophy (GRMD) dog model more closely resembles the human DMD condition, we aimed to assess the generation of oxidants by inflammatory cells and taurine metabolism in this species. In muscles of 8 month GRMD dogs there was an increase in the content of neutrophils and macrophages, and an associated increase in elevated myeloperoxidase, a protein secreted by neutrophils that catalyses production of the highly reactive hypochlorous acid (HOCl). There was also increased chlorination of tyrosines, a marker of HOCl generation, increased thiol oxidation of many proteins and irreversible oxidative protein damage. Taurine, which functions as an antioxidant by trapping HOCl, was reduced in GRMD plasma; however taurine was increased in GRMD muscle tissue, potentially due to increased muscle taurine transport and synthesis.

     "abstract": "The NADPH oxidases are important transmembrane proteins producing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Within the Nox family, different modes of activation can be discriminated. Nox1-3 are dependent on different cytosolic subunits, Nox4 seems to be constitutively active and Nox5 is directly activated by calcium. With the exception of Nox5, all Nox family members are thought to depend on the small transmembrane protein p22phox. With the discovery of the CRISPR/Cas9-system, a tool to alter genomic DNA sequences has become available. So far, this method has not been widely used in the redox community. On such basis, we decided to study the requirement of p22phox in the Nox complex using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout. Knockout of the gene of p22phox, CYBA, led to an ablation of activity of Nox4 and Nox1 but not of Nox5. Production of hydrogen peroxide or superoxide after knockout could be rescued with either human or rat p22phox, but not with the DUOX-maturation factors DUOXA1/A2. Furthermore, different mutations of p22phox were studied regarding the influence on Nox4-dependent H2O2 production. P22phox Q130* and Y121H affected maturation and activity of Nox4. Hence, Nox5-dependent O2\u2022\u2212 production is independent of p22phox, but native p22phox is needed for maturation of Nox4 and production of H2O2.",

Previous findings indicate that during oxidative stress conditions excess cholesterol autoxidizes to oxysterols. To date, the role of oxysterols and their potential interaction with fatty acids accumulation in NASH pathogenesis remains little investigated.We used the nutritional model of high fatty acids (HFA), high cholesterol (HCh) or high fat and high cholesterol (HFA+FCh) diets and explored by a lipidomic approach, the blood and liver distribution of fatty acids and oxysterols in response to dietary manipulation. We observed that HFA or HCh diets induced fatty liver without inflammation, which was otherwise observed only after supplementation of HFA+HCh. Very interestingly, the combination model was associated with a specific oxysterol fingerprint.The present work provides a complete analysis of the change in lipids and oxysterols profile induced by different lipid dietary model and their association with histological alteration of the liver. This study allows the generation of interesting hypotheses on the role of interaction of lipid and cholesterol metabolites in the liver injury during NAFLD development and progression. Moreover, the changes in the concentration and quality of oxysterols induced by a combination diet suggest a novel potential pathogenic mechanism in the progression from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress is implicated in increased vascular permeability associated with metabolic disorders, but the underlying redox mechanism is poorly defined. S-glutathionylation, a stable adduct of glutathione with protein sulfhydryl, is a reversible oxidative modification of protein and is emerging as an important redox signaling paradigm in cardiovascular physiopathology. The present study determines the role of protein S-glutathionylation in metabolic stress-induced endothelial cell permeability.In endothelial cells isolated from patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus, protein S-glutathionylation level was increased. This change was also observed in aortic endothelium in ApoE deficient (ApoE-/-) mice fed on Western diet. Metabolic stress-induced protein S-glutathionylation in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC) was positively correlated with elevated endothelial cell permeability, as reflected by disassembly of cell-cell adherens junctions and cortical actin structures. These impairments were reversed by adenoviral overexpression of a specific de-glutathionylation enzyme, glutaredoxin-1 in cultured HAECs. Consistently, transgenic overexpression of human Glrx-1 in ApoE-/- mice fed the Western diet attenuated endothelial protein S-glutathionylation, actin cytoskeletal disorganization, and vascular permeability in the aorta. Mechanistically, glutathionylation and inactivation of Rac1, a small RhoGPase, were associated with endothelial hyperpermeability caused by metabolic stress. Glutathionylation of Rac1 on cysteine 81 and 157 located adjacent to guanine nucleotide binding site was required for the metabolic stress to inhibit Rac1 activity and promote endothelial hyperpermeability.Glutathionylation and inactivation of Rac1 in endothelial cells represent a novel redox mechanism of vascular barrier dysfunction associated with metabolic disorders.",

     "abstract": "The accurate and sensitive detection of biological free radicals in a reliable manner is required to define the mechanistic roles of such species in biochemistry, medicine and toxicology. Most of the techniques currently available are either not appropriate to detect free radicals in cells and tissues due to sensitivity limitations (electron spin resonance, ESR) or subject to artifacts that make the validity of the results questionable (fluorescent probe-based analysis). The development of the immuno-spin trapping technique overcomes all these difficulties. This technique is based on the reaction of amino acid- and DNA base-derived radicals with the spin trap 5, 5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO) to form protein- and DNA-DMPO nitroxide radical adducts, respectively. These adducts have limited stability and decay to produce the very stable macromolecule-DMPO-nitrone product. This stable product can be detected by mass spectrometry, NMR or immunochemistry by the use of anti-DMPO nitrone antibodies. The formation of macromolecule-DMPO-nitrone adducts is based on the selective reaction of free radical addition to the spin trap and is thus not subject to artifacts frequently encountered with other methods for free radical detection. The selectivity of spin trapping for free radicals in biological systems has been proven by ESR. Immuno-spin trapping is proving to be a potent, sensitive (a million times higher sensitivity than ESR), and easy (not quantum mechanical) method to detect low levels of macromolecule-derived radicals produced in vitro and in vivo. Anti-DMPO antibodies have been used to determine the distribution of free radicals in cells and tissues and even in living animals. In summary, the invention of the immuno-spin trapping technique has had a major impact on the ability to accurately and sensitively detect biological free radicals and, subsequently, on our understanding of the role of free radicals in biochemistry, medicine and toxicology.",

     "abstract": "Peroxiredoxin (PRDX) is a ubiquitous oxidoreductase protein with a conserved ionised thiol that permits catalysis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) up to a million times faster than any thiol-containing signalling protein. The increased production of H2O2 within active tissues during exercise is thought to oxidise conserved cysteine thiols, which may in turn facilitate a wide variety of physiological adaptations. The precise mechanisms linking H2O2 with the oxidation of signalling thiol proteins (phosphates, kinases and transcription factors) are unclear due to these proteins' low reactivity with H2O2 relative to abundant thiol peroxidases such as PRDX. Recent work has shown that following exposure to H2O2 in vitro, the sulfenic acid of the PRDX cysteine can form mixed disulphides with transcription factors associated with cell survival. This implicates PRDX as an \u2018active\u2019 redox relay in transmitting the oxidising equivalent of H2O2 to downstream proteins. Furthermore, under oxidative stress, PRDX can form stable oxidised dimers that can be secreted into the extracellular space, potentially acting as an extracellular \u2018stress\u2019 signal. There is extensive literature assessing non-specific markers of oxidative stress in response to exercise, however the PRDX catalytic cycle may offer a more robust approach for measuring changes in redox balance following exercise. This review discusses studies assessing PRDX-mediated cellular signalling and integrates the recent advances in redox biology with investigations that have examined the role of PRDX during exercise in humans and animals. Future studies should explore the role of PRDX as a key regulator of peroxide mediated-signal transduction during exercise in humans.",

It was hypothesized that NO2-FA would impact mitochondrial redox reactions to induce tissue-protective metabolic shifts in cells. Nitro-oleic acid (OA-NO2) reversibly inhibited complex II-linked respiration in isolated rat heart mitochondria in a pH-dependent manner and suppressed superoxide formation. Nitroalkylation of Fp subunit was determined by BME capture and the site of modification by OA-NO2 defined by mass spectrometric analysis. These effects translated into reduced basal and maximal respiration and favored glycolytic metabolism in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts as assessed by extracellular H+ and O2 flux analysis. The perfusion of NO2-FA induced acute cardioprotection in an isolated perfused heart ischemia/reperfusion (IR) model as evidenced by significantly higher rate-pressure products. Together these findings indicate that NO2-FA can promote cardioprotection by inducing a shift from respiration to glycolysis and suppressing reactive species formation in the post-ischemic interval.",

We hypothesized that the correction of redox potential of glutathione by adding glutathione in PN protects the MAT activity.To investigate whether the addition of glutathione to PN can reverse the inhibition of MAT observed in animal on PN.Three days old guinea pigs received through a jugular vein catheter 2 series of solutions.

The slope of the linear relation between MAT activity and redox potential was two fold lower in animal infused with PN than in others groups.The present study suggests that prevention of peroxide generation in PN and/or correction of the redox potential by adding glutathione in PN are not sufficient, at least in newborn guinea pigs, to restore normal MAT activity.",

     "abstract": "Metabolic and bioenergetic dysfunction are associated with oxidative stress and thought to be a common underlying mechanism of chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Recent findings support an emerging concept that circulating leukocytes and platelets can act as sensors or biomarkers of mitochondrial function in patients subjected to metabolic diseases. It is proposed that systemic stress-induced alterations in leukocyte bioenergetics are the consequence of several factors including reactive oxygen species. This suggests that oxidative stress mediated changes in leukocyte mitochondrial function could be used as an indicator of bioenergetic health in individuals. To test this concept, we investigated the effect of the redox cycling agent, 2,3 dimethoxynaphthoquinone (DMNQ) on the bioenergetic profiles of monocytes isolated from healthy human subjects using the extracellular flux analyzer. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that the bioenergetic health index (BHI), a single value that represents the bioenergetic health of individuals, is dynamically sensitive to oxidative stress in human monocytes. DMNQ decreased monocyte ATP-linked respiration, maximal respiration, and reserve capacity and caused an increase in proton leak and non-mitochondrial respiration compared to monocytes not treated with DMNQ. The BHI was a more sensitive indicator of the DMNQ-dependent changes in bioenergetics than any individual parameter. These data suggest that monocytes are susceptible to oxidative stress mediated by DMNQ and this can be accurately assessed by the BHI. Taken together, our findings suggest that the BHI has the potential to act as a functional biomarker of the impact of systemic oxidative stress in patients with metabolic disorders.",

At 24\u00a0h post-injury, spinal cord tissue homogenate and mitochondrial fractions were isolated concurrently and assessed for glutathione (GSH) content and production of nitric oxide (NO\u2022), in addition to the presence of oxidative stress markers 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), protein carbonyl (PC), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Moreover, we assessed production of superoxide ( O 2 \u2022 - ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in mitochondrial fractions. Quantitative biochemical analyses showed that compared to sham, SCI significantly lowered GSH content accompanied by increased NO\u2022 production in both cellular and mitochondrial fractions. SCI also resulted in increased O 2 \u2022 - and H2O2 levels in mitochondrial fractions. Western blot analysis further showed that reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) mediated PC and 3-NT production were significantly higher in both fractions after SCI. Conversely, neither 4-HNE levels nor LPO formation were increased at 24\u00a0h after injury in either tissue homogenate or mitochondrial fractions. These results indicate that by 24\u00a0h post-injury ROS-induced protein oxidation is more prominent compared to lipid oxidation, indicating a critical temporal distinction in secondary pathophysiology that is critical in designing therapeutic approaches to mitigate consequences of oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Metastasis is the most life threatening aspect of breast cancer. It is a multi-step process involving invasion and migration of primary tumor cells with a subsequent colonization of these cells at a secondary location. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of thioredoxin (Trx1) in the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells and to assess the strength of the association between high levels of Trx1 and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR1) expression with breast cancer patient survival. Our results indicate that the expression of both Trx1 and TrxR1 are statistically significantly increased in breast cancer patient cells compared with paired normal breast tissue from the same patient. Over-expression of Trx1 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines enhanced cell invasion in in vitro assays while expression of a redox inactive mutant form of Trx1 (designated 1SS) or the antisense mRNA inhibited cell invasion. Addition of exogenous Trx1 also enhanced cell invasion, while addition of a specific monoclonal antibody that inhibits Trx1 redox function decreased cell invasion. Over-expression of intracellular Trx1 did not increase cell migration but expression of intracellular 1SS inhibited migration. Addition of exogenous Trx1 enhanced cell migration while 1SS had no effect. Treatment with auranofin inhibited TrxR activity, cell migration and clonogenic activity of MDA-MB-231 cells, while increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Analysis of 25 independent cohorts with 5910 patients showed that Trx1 and TrxR1 were both associated with a poor patient prognosis in terms of overall survival, distant metastasis free survival and disease free survival. Therefore, targeting the Trx system with auranofin or other specific inhibitors may provide improved breast cancer patient outcomes through inhibition of cancer invasion and migration.",

In this study, we investigated whether genetic silencing of Nrf2, regulating the transcription of antioxidant genes, affected melanogenesis in primary human epidermal melanocytes (HEMn) and B16F10 melanoma cells subjected to UVA (8\u00a0J/cm2) exposure. Then, we explored the antimelanogenic actions of phenolics; caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA) providing partial UVA protection; quercetin (QU) and rutin (RU) providing strong UVA protection and; avobenzone (AV), an efficient UVA filter, in association with modulation of Nrf2-mediated antioxidant defenses in response to UVA insults in B16F10 cells. Upon oxidative insults, Nrf2 silencing promoted melanogenesis in both HEMn and B16F10 cells irradiated with UVA. Stimulation of melanogenesis by UVA correlated with increased ROS and oxidative DNA damage (8-OHdG), GSH depletion as well as a transient downregulation of Nrf2 nuclear translocation and of Nrf2-ARE signaling in B16F10 cells. All test compounds exerted antimelanogenic effects with respect to their abilities to reverse UVA-mediated oxidative damage as well as downregulation of Nrf2 activity and its target antioxidants (GCLC, GST and NQO1) in B16F10 cells. In conclusion, defective Nrf2 may promote melanogenesis under UVA irradiation through oxidative stress mechanisms.

Antioxidant was shown to protect telomerase activity in normal cells but inhibit that in cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism is elusive. Here we found that 7721 hepatoma cells held a higher redox homeostasis threshold than L02 normal liver cells which caused 7721 cells to have a higher demand for ROS; MnSOD over-expression in 7721 decreased endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibited telomerase activity; Akt phosphorylation inhibitor and NAC both inhibited 7721 telomerase activity. The over-elimination of ROS by NAC resulted in the inhibition of Akt pathway. Our results suggest that ROS is involved in the regulation of cancer telomerase activity through Akt pathway. The different intracellular redox homeostasis and antioxidant system in normal cells and tumor cells may be the cause of the opposite effect on telomerase activity in response to NAC treatment. Our results provide a theoretical base of using antioxidants selectively inhibit cancer telomerase activity.

This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of RTA 408 in cultured RPE cells during oxidative stress and to determine the effects of RTA 408 on Nrf2 and its downstream target genes. Primary human RPE cells were pretreated with RTA 408 and then incubated in 200\u00a0\u03bcM H2O2 for 6\u00a0h. Cell viability was measured with the WST-8 assay. Apoptosis was quantitatively measured by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining and Hoechst 33342 fluorescent staining. Reduced (GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) were measured using colorimetric assays. Nrf2 activation and its downstream effects on phase II enzymes were examined by Western blot. Treatment of RPE cells with nanomolar ranges (10 and 100\u00a0nM) of RTA 408 markedly attenuated H2O2-induced viability loss and apoptosis. RTA 408 pretreatment significantly protected cells from oxidative stress-induced GSH loss, GSSG formation and decreased ROS production. RTA 408 activated Nrf2 and increased the expression of its downstream genes, such as HO-1, NQO1, SOD2, catalase, Grx1, and Trx1. Consequently, the enzyme activities of NQO1, Grx1, and Trx1 were fully protected by RTA 408 pretreatment under oxidative stress. Moreover, knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA significantly reduced the cytoprotective effects of RTA 408. In conclusion, our data suggest that RTA 408 protect primary human RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced damage by activating Nrf2 and its downstream genes.",

     "abstract": "At its core mitochondrial function relies on redox reactions. Electrons stripped from nutrients are used to form NADH and NADPH, electron carriers that are similar in structure but support different functions. NADH supports ATP production but also generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide ( O 2 \u00b7 - ) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). NADH-driven ROS production is counterbalanced by NADPH which maintains antioxidants in an active state. Mitochondria rely on a redox buffering network composed of reduced glutathione (GSH) and peroxiredoxins (Prx) to quench ROS generated by nutrient metabolism. As H2O2 is quenched, NADPH is expended to reactivate antioxidant networks and reset the redox environment. Thus, the mitochondrial redox environment is in a constant state of flux reflecting changes in nutrient and ROS metabolism. Changes in redox environment can modulate protein function through oxidation of protein cysteine thiols. Typically cysteine oxidation is considered to be mediated by H2O2 which oxidizes protein thiols (SH) forming sulfenic acid (SOH). However, problems begin to emerge when one critically evaluates the regulatory function of SOH. Indeed SOH formation is slow, non-specific, and once formed SOH reacts rapidly with a variety of molecules. By contrast, protein S-glutathionylation (PGlu) reactions involve the conjugation and removal of glutathione moieties from modifiable cysteine residues. PGlu reactions are driven by fluctuations in the availability of GSH and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and thus should be exquisitely sensitive to changes ROS flux due to shifts in the glutathione pool in response to varying H2O2 availability. Here, we propose that energy metabolism-linked redox signals originating from mitochondria are mediated indirectly by H2O2 through the GSH redox buffering network in and outside mitochondria. This proposal is based on several observations that have shown that unlike other redox modifications PGlu reactions fulfill the requisite criteria to serve as an effective posttranslational modification that controls protein function.",

The isoflavone prunetin was recently identified to improve intestinal epithelial barrier function in vitro and to ameliorate general survival and overall health state in vivo in male Drosophila melanogaster. However, the prunetin-mediated health benefits in the fruit fly were ascertained under standard living conditions. As the loss of intestinal integrity is closely related to a reduction in Drosophila lifespan and barrier dysfunction increases with age, effects on prunetin-modulated gut health under oxidative or pathogenic stress provocation remain to be elucidated. In this study, male adult D. melanogaster were administered either a prunetin or a control diet. Gut-derived junction protein expression and pathogen-induced antimicrobial peptide expressions as well as the stem cell proliferation in the gut were evaluated. Furthermore, survival following exposure to hydrogen peroxide was assessed. Prunetin ingestion did not attenuate bacterial infection and did not protect flies from oxidative stress. Intestinal mRNA expression levels of adherence and septate junction proteins as well as the stem cell proliferation were not altered by prunetin intake. Prunetin does not improve the resistance of flies against severe injuring, exogenous stress and therefore seems to function in a preventive rather than a therapeutic approach since the health-promoting benefits appear to be exclusively restricted to normal living circumstances.",

DPPP itself is not fluorescent, but it reacts with lipid hydroperoxides stochiometrically to give highly fluorescent DPPP oxide and lipid hydroxides. The production of lipid hydroperoxides could be followed continuously in the oxidation of plasma induced by peroxynitrite, hypochlorite, 15-lipoxygenase, and peroxyl radicals with a microplate reader. A clear lag phase was observed in the plasma oxidation mediated by aqueous peroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite, but not in the oxidation induced by hypochlorite and lipoxygenase.

     "abstract": "Many cancer cells follow an aberrant metabolic program to maintain energy for rapid cell proliferation. Metabolic reprogramming often involves the upregulation of glutaminolysis to generate reducing equivalents for the electron transport chain and amino acids for protein synthesis. Critical enzymes involved in metabolism possess a reactive thiolate group, which can be modified by certain oxidants. In the current study, we show that modification of mitochondrial protein thiols by a model compound, iodobutyl triphenylphosphonium (IBTP), decreased mitochondrial metabolism and ATP in MDA-MB 231 (MB231) breast adenocarcinoma cells up to 6 days after an initial 24\u00a0h treatment. Mitochondrial thiol modification also depressed oxygen consumption rates (OCR) in a dose-dependent manner to a greater extent than a non-thiol modifying analog, suggesting that thiol reactivity is an important factor in the inhibition of cancer cell metabolism. In non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells, IBTP also decreased OCR; however the extracellular acidification rate was significantly increased at all but the highest concentration (10\u00a0\u00b5M) of IBTP indicating that thiol modification can have significantly different effects on bioenergetics in tumorigenic versus non-tumorigenic cells. ATP and other adenonucleotide levels were also decreased by thiol modification up to 6 days post-treatment, indicating a decreased overall energetic state in MB231 cells. Cellular proliferation of MB231 cells was also inhibited up to 6 days post-treatment with little change to cell viability. Targeted metabolomic analyses revealed that thiol modification caused depletion of both Krebs cycle and glutaminolysis intermediates. Further experiments revealed that the activity of the Krebs cycle enzyme, aconitase, was attenuated in response to thiol modification.

     "abstract": "A number of age-related diseases have a low incidence in females, which is attributed to a protective effect of sex hormones. For instance, the female sex hormone estrogen (E2) has a well established cytoprotective effect against oxidative stress, which strongly contributes to ageing. However, the mechanism by which E2 exerts its protective activity remains elusive.In this study we address the question whether the E2-induced protective effect against hyperoxia is mediated by the Nrf-2/Keap-1 signaling pathway. In particular, we investigate the E2-induced expression and cellular distribution of DPP III monozinc exopeptidase, a member of the Nrf-2/Keap-1 pathway, upon hyperoxia treatment.We find that DPP III accumulates in the nucleus in response to hyperoxia. Further, we show that combined induction of hyperoxia and E2 administration have an additive effect on the nuclear accumulation of DPP III. The level of nuclear accumulation of DPP III is comparable to nuclear accumulation of Nrf-2 in healthy female mice exposed to hyperoxia. In ovariectomized females exposed to hyperoxia, supplementation of E2 induced upregulation of DPP III, Ho-1, Sirt-1 and downregulation of Ppar-\u03b3. While other cytoprotective mechanisms cannot be excluded, these findings demonstrate a prominent role of DPP III, along with Sirt-1, in the E2-mediated protection against hyperoxia.",

The involvement of oxidative stress in the development of cholestasis has been demonstrated in different experimental models. However, its role in the morbidity of human cholestasis is far to be elucidated. The aim of the study was the evaluation of oxidative stress markers in blood from patients with OJ and its relation to complications and benign/malignant evolution of cholestasis. Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study of 105 patients with OJ and 34 control subjects were included. Several markers of liver function and oxidative stress, such as lipoperoxides (LPO), as well as reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities were assessed. Results: The patients with OJ showed a marked increase in plasma levels of LPO, SOD and GSH, while GSH-Px levels were decreased. The increase in lipid peroxidation products and the depletion of SOD activity in blood were also related to renal dysfunction. The highest level of LPO was associated with malignant etiology of the disease. The logistic regression analysis showed that the age of the patient and the levels of LPO in blood were predictors of renal dysfunction in OJ patients. Conclusions: This study demonstrates a correlation between oxidative stress and renal dysfunction patients with OJ.",

     "abstract": "We hypothesized that vitamin E (\u03b1-tocopherol) is required by the developing embryonic brain to prevent depletion of highly polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6), the loss of which we predicted would underlie abnormal morphological and behavioral outcomes. Therefore, we fed adult 5D zebrafish (Danio rerio) defined diets without (E\u2212) or with added \u03b1-tocopherol (E+, 500\u00a0mg RRR-\u03b1-tocopheryl acetate/kg diet) for a minimum of 80 days, and then spawned them to obtain E\u2212 and E+ embryos. The E\u2212 compared with E+ embryos were 82% less responsive (p<0.01) to a light/dark stimulus at 96\u00a0h post-fertilization (hpf), demonstrating impaired locomotor behavior, even in the absence of gross morphological defects. Evaluation of phospholipid (PL) and lysophospholipid (lyso-PL) composition using untargeted lipidomics in E\u2212 compared with E+ embryos at 24, 48, 72, and 120\u00a0hpf showed that four PLs and three lyso-PLs containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), including lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC 22:6, required for transport of DHA into the brain, p<0.001), were at lower concentrations in E\u2212 at all time-points. Additionally, H218O labeling experiments revealed enhanced turnover of LPC 22:6 (p<0.001) and three other DHA-containing PLs in the E\u2212 compared with the E+ embryos, suggesting that increased membrane remodeling is a result of PL depletion. Together, these data indicate that \u03b1-tocopherol deficiency in the zebrafish embryo causes the specific depletion and increased turnover of DHA-containing PL and lyso-PLs, which may compromise DHA delivery to the brain and thereby contribute to the functional impairments observed in E\u2212 embryos.",

     "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by an accumulation of abnormal clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Despite recent advancements in anti-myeloma therapies, MM remains an incurable disease. Antioxidant molecules are upregulated in many cancers, correlating with tumor proliferation, survival, and chemoresistance and therefore, have been suggested as potential therapeutic targets. This study investigated the cross-talk between two antioxidant molecules, thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and their therapeutic implications in MM. We found that although auranofin, a TrxR inhibitor, significantly inhibited TrxR activity by more than 50% at lower concentrations, myeloma cell proliferation was only inhibited at higher concentrations of auranofin. Inhibition of TrxR using lower auranofin concentrations induced HO-1 protein expression in myeloma cells. Using a sub-lethal concentration of auranofin to inhibit TrxR activity in conjunction with HO-1 inhibition significantly decreased myeloma cell growth and induced apoptosis. TrxR was shown to regulate HO-1 via the Nrf2 signaling pathway in a ROS-dependent manner. Increased HO-1 mRNA levels were observed in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells compared to parent cells and HO-1 inhibition restored the sensitivity to bortezomib in bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells. These findings indicate that concurrent inhibition of HO-1 with either a TrxR inhibitor or with bortezomib would improve therapeutic outcomes in MM patients. Hence, our findings further support the need to target multiple antioxidant systems alone or in combination with other therapeutics to improve therapeutic outcomes in MM patients.",

     "abstract": "It has been reported that reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, take part in osteoclast differentiation as intra-cellular signaling molecules. The current assumed signaling cascade from RANK to ROS production is RANK, TRAF6, Rac1, and then Nox. The target molecules of ROS in RANKL signaling remain unclear; however, several reports support the theory that NF-\u03baB signaling could be the crucial downstream signaling molecule of RANKL-mediated ROS signaling. Furthermore, ROS exert cytotoxic effects such as peroxidation of lipids and phospholipids and oxidative damage to proteins and DNA. Therefore, cells have several protective mechanisms against oxidative stressors that mainly induce cytoprotective enzymes and ROS scavenging. Three well-known mechanisms regulate cytoprotective enzymes including Nrf2-, FOXO-, and sirtuin-dependent mechanisms. Several reports have indicated a crosslink between FOXO- and sirtuin-dependent regulatory mechanisms. The agonists against the regulatory mechanisms are reported to induce these cytoprotective enzymes successfully. Some of them inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone destruction via attenuation of intracellular ROS signaling. In this review article, we discuss the above topics and summarize the current information available on the relationship between cytoprotective enzymes and osteoclastogenesis.",

Diabetes induced with high fat diet (for 8 weeks) and multipl low doses intraperitoneal injection of STZ (twice, 30\u00a0mg/kg/d i.p). The diabetic animals were randomly assigned to one of the experimental groups as follows: Control group (C), high fat diet (HFD), STZ-induced diabetic group (HFD+STZ) , HFD+STZ diabetic group received melatonin (10\u00a0mg/kg/d i.p), HFD+STZ diabetic group received L-carnitine (0.6\u00a0g/kg/d i.p), and HFD+STZ diabetic group received glibenclamide (5\u00a0mg/kg/d, oral). The serum fasting blood glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, HDL- cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were tested. Acetylcholine induced endothelium-dependent relaxation and sodium nitroprusside induced endothelium-independent relaxation were measured in aortas for estimating endothelial function. Also, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and nitric oxide (NO) levels activities were determined in rat liver. According to our results melatonin and L-carnitine treatment decreased fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, and LDL levels. MDA levels significantly decreased with the melatonin treatment whereas SOD levels were not significantly changed between the groups. The results suggest that especially melatonin restores the vascular responses and endothelial dysfunction in diabetes.",

     "abstract": "The notion that electrophiles serve as messengers in cell signaling is now widely accepted. Nonetheless, major issues restrain acceptance of redox homeostasis and redox signaling as components of maintenance of a normal physiological steady state. The first is that redox signaling requires sudden switching on of oxidant production and bypassing of antioxidant mechanisms rather than a continuous process that, like other signaling mechanisms, can be smoothly turned up or down. The second is the misperception that reactions in redox signaling involve \u201creactive oxygen species\u201d rather than reaction of specific electrophiles with specific protein thiolates. The third is that hormesis provides protection against oxidants by increasing cellular defense or repair mechanisms rather than by specifically addressing the offset of redox homeostasis. Instead, we propose that both oxidant and antioxidant signaling are main features of redox homeostasis. As the redox shift is rapidly reversed by feedback reactions, homeostasis is maintained by continuous signaling for production and elimination of electrophiles and nucleophiles. Redox homeostasis, which is the maintenance of nucleophilic tone, accounts for a healthy physiological steady state. Electrophiles and nucleophiles are not intrinsically harmful or protective, and redox homeostasis is an essential feature of both the response to challenges and subsequent feedback. While the balance between oxidants and nucleophiles is preserved in redox homeostasis, oxidative stress provokes the establishment of a new radically altered redox steady state. The popular belief that scavenging free radicals by antioxidants has a beneficial effect is wishful thinking. We propose, instead, that continuous feedback preserves nucleophilic tone and that this is supported by redox active nutritional phytochemicals. These nonessential compounds, by activating Nrf2, mimic the effect of endogenously produced electrophiles (parahormesis). In summary, while hormesis, although globally protective, results in setting up of a new phenotype, parahormesis contributes to health by favoring maintenance of homeostasis.",

The accumulated data demonstrated that oxidative DNA damage and chronic liver inflammation are involved in the transformation of normal hepatocytes and their evolution towards hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the levels of 8-oxy-2\u2032-deoxy-guanosine (8-oxodG), a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage, were overestimated and underestimated in previous reports due to various technical limitations. The current techniques are not suitable to analyze the 8-oxodG levels in the non-malignant liver tissues and tumors of hepatocellular carcinoma patients unless they are modified. Therefore, in this study, the protocols for extraction and hydrolysis of DNA were optimized using 54 samples from hepatocellular carcinoma patients with various risk factors, and the 8-oxodG and 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (dG) levels were measured. The patients enrolled in the study include 23 from The Princess Alexandra Hospital and The Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospitals, Brisbane, Australia, and 31 from South Africa. This study revealed that the 8-oxodG/dG ratios tended to be higher in most non-malignant liver tissues compared to hepatocellular carcinoma tissue (p=0.2887).

Here we report that diluted enzymes from lysed human leukocytes produce extracellular energy. Our findings involve two pathways: the purine nucleotide catabolic pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway, which function together to generate energy as NADPH. Glucose6P fuel for NADPH production is generated from structural ribose of purine ribonucleoside monophosphates, ADP, and ADP-ribose. NADPH drives glutathione reductase to reduce an oxidized glutathione disulfide-glutathione redox couple. Acid phosphatases initiate ribose5P salvage from purine ribonucleoside monophosphates, and transaldolase controls the direction of carbon chain flow through the nonoxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway. These metabolic control points are regulated by pH. Biologically, this energy conserving metabolism could function in perturbed extracellular spaces.",

Although S-glutathionylation is required to protect Ogdh from irreversible oxidation while simultaneously modulating its activity it remains unknown if glutathione can also modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by the complex. We report that reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione control O 2 \u2219 - /H2O2 formation by Ogdh through protein S-glutathionylation reactions. GSSG (1\u00a0mM) induced a modest decrease in Ogdh activity which was associated with a significant decrease in O 2 \u2219 - /H2O2 formation. GSH had the opposite effect, amplifying O 2 \u2219 - /H2O2 formation by Ogdh. Incubation of purified Ogdh in 2.5\u00a0mM GSH led to significant increase in O 2 \u2219 - /H2O2 formation which also lowered NADH production. Inclusion of enzymatically active glutaredoxin-2 (Grx2) in reaction mixtures reversed the GSH-mediated amplification of O 2 \u2219 - /H2O2 formation. Similarly pre-incubation of permeabilized liver mitochondria from mouse depleted of GSH showed an approximately ~3.5-fold increase in Ogdh-mediated O 2 \u2219 - /H2O2 production that was matched by a significant decrease in NADH formation which could be reversed by Grx2. Taken together, our results demonstrate GSH and GSSG modulate ROS production by Ogdh through S-glutathionylation of different subunits. This is also the first demonstration that GSH can work in the opposite direction in mitochondria-amplifying ROS formation instead of quenching it. We propose that this regulatory mechanism is required to modulate ROS emission from Ogdh in response to variations in glutathione redox buffering capacity.",

     "abstract": "Pulmonary fibrosis affects millions worldwide and, even though there has been a significant investment in understanding the processes involved in wound healing and maladaptive repair, a complete understanding of the mechanisms responsible for lung fibrogenesis eludes us, and interventions capable of reversing or halting disease progression are not available. Pulmonary fibrosis is characterized by the excessive expression and uncontrolled deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins resulting in erosion of the tissue structure. Initially considered an \u2018end-stage\u2019 process elicited after injury, these events are now considered pathogenic and are believed to contribute to the course of the disease. By interacting with integrins capable of signal transduction and by influencing tissue mechanics, ECM proteins modulate processes ranging from cell adhesion and migration to differentiation and growth factor expression. In doing so, ECM proteins help orchestrate complex developmental processes and maintain tissue homeostasis. However, poorly controlled deposition of ECM proteins promotes inflammation, fibroproliferation, and aberrant differentiation of cells, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis, atherosclerosis and cancer. Considering their vital functions, ECM proteins are the target of investigation, and oxidation\u2013reduction (redox) reactions have emerged as important regulators of the ECM. Oxidative stress invariably accompanies lung disease and promotes ECM expression directly or through the overproduction of pro-fibrotic growth factors, while affecting integrin binding and activation. In vitro and in vivo investigations point to redox reactions as targets for intervention in pulmonary fibrosis and related disorders, but studies in humans have been disappointing probably due to the narrow impact of the interventions tested, and our poor understanding of the factors that regulate these complex reactions. This review is not meant to provide a comprehensive review of this field, but rather to highlight what has been learned and to raise interest in this area in need of much attention.",

Knocking down of HO-1 by transfection of HO-1 siRNA significantly attenuated RAR.

Functional glyoxalases in the host-parasite unit might therefore be crucial for parasite survival. Here, we determined the antimalarial and hemolytic activity of two tight-binding glyoxalase inhibitors using infected and uninfected erythrocytes. In addition, we synthesized and analyzed a set of diester derivates of both tight-binding inhibitors resulting in up to threefold lower IC50 values and an altered methemoglobin formation and hemolytic activity depending on the type of ester. Inhibitor treatments of uninfected erythrocytes revealed an extremely slow inactivation of the host cell glyoxalase, irrespective of inhibitor modifications, and a potential dispensability of the host cell enzyme for parasite survival.

The current study assessed the functional roles of PARP-1 within human lens cells in response to oxidative stress. The human lens epithelial cell line FHL124 and whole human lens cultures were used as experimental systems. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) was employed to induce oxidative stress and cell death was assessed by LDH release. The functional influence of PARP-1 was assessed using targeted siRNA and chemical inhibition (by AG14361). Immunocytochemistry and western blotting were used to assess PARP-1 expression and the alkaline comet assay determined the levels of DNA strand breaks. PARP-1 was generally observed in the cell nucleus in both the FHL124 cell line and whole human lenses. PARP-1 inhibition rendered FHL124 cells more susceptible to H2O2-induced DNA strand breaks. Interestingly, reduction of PARP-1 activity significantly inhibited H2O2-induced cell death relative to control cells. Inhibition of PARP-1 in whole human lenses resulted in a reduced level of lens opacity and cell death following exposure to H2O2 relative to matched pair controls. Thus, we show that PARP-1 could play a role in the fate of human lens cells, and these first observations in human lenses suggest that it could impact on lens opacity.

We have found that although both HbA and HbE autoxidize at initially comparable rates, HbE loses heme at a rate almost 2 fold higher than HbA due to unfolding of the protein. Using mass spectrometry and the spin trap, DMPO, we were able to quantify irreversible oxidization of \u03b2Cys93 to reflect oxidative instability of \u03b2 subunits. In the presence of free \u03b1 subunits and H2O2, both HbA and HbE showed \u03b2Cys93 oxidation which increased with higher H2O2 concentrations.

The NF-\u03baB pathway is regulated by oxidant-induced post-translational modifications. Protein S-glutathionylation, or the conjugation of the antioxidant molecule, glutathione to reactive cysteines inhibits the activity of inhibitory kappa B kinase beta (IKK\u03b2), among other NF-\u03baB proteins. Glutathione S-transferase Pi (GSTP) is an enzyme that has been shown to catalyze protein S-glutathionylation (PSSG) under conditions of oxidative stress. The objective of the present study was to determine whether GSTP regulates NF-\u03baB signaling, S-glutathionylation of IKK, and subsequent pro-inflammatory signaling. We demonstrated that, in unstimulated cells, GSTP associated with the inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, I\u03baB\u03b1. However, exposure to LPS resulted in a rapid loss of association between I\u03baB\u03b1 and GSTP, and instead led to a protracted association between IKK\u03b2 and GSTP. LPS exposure also led to increases in the S-glutathionylation of IKK\u03b2. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of GSTP decreased IKK\u03b2-SSG, and enhanced NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation, transcriptional activity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLK117, an isotype-selective inhibitor of GSTP, also enhanced LPS-induced NF-\u03baB transcriptional activity and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, suggesting that the catalytic activity of GSTP is important in repressing NF-\u03baB activation. Expression of both wild-type and catalytically-inactive Y7F mutant GSTP significantly attenuated LPS- or IKK\u03b2-induced production of GM-CSF. These studies indicate a complex role for GSTP in modulating NF-\u03baB, which may involve S-glutathionylation of IKK proteins, and interaction with NF-\u03baB family members. Our findings suggest that targeting GSTP is a potential avenue for regulating the activity of this prominent pro-inflammatory and immunomodulatory transcription factor.",

It regulates various biological responses in both physiological and pathological conditions, often time producing seemingly contradictory results. The details of the effects of NO are highly dependent on the level of NO that cells experience and the temporal aspect of when and how long cells are exposed to NO. Herein, we present a novel measurement system (CellNO trap) that allows real-time NO measurement via chemiluminescence detection from general adhesive cultured cells using standard cell culture media and reagents that does not perturb the cells under investigation. Highly controlled light-initiated NO releasing polymer SNAP-PDMS was used to characterize and validate the quantitative data nature of the device. The NO generation profile from the macrophage cell-line RAW264.7 stimulated by 100\u00a0ng/ml LPS and 10\u00a0ng/ml IFN-\u03b3 was recorded. Measured maximum NO flux from RAW264.7 varied between around 2.5\u20139\u00a0pmol/106\u00a0cell/s under 100\u00a0ng/ml LPS and 10\u00a0ng/ml IFN-\u03b3 stimulation, and 24\u00a0h cumulative NO varied between 157 and 406 nmol/106cell depending on different culture conditions, indicating the conventional report of an average flux or maximum flux is not sufficient to represent the dynamic characters of NO. LPS and IFN-\u03b3\u2019s synergistic effect to RAW264.7 NO generation was also directly observed with the CellNO trap. The real-time effect on the NO generation from RAW264.7 following the addition of arginine, nor-NOHA and L-NAME to the cultured cells is presented. There is great potential to further our understanding of the role NO plays in normal and pathological conditions clearly understanding the dynamic production of NO in response to different stimuli and conditions; use of CellNO trap makes it possible to quantitatively determine the precise NO release profile generated from cells in a continuous and real-time manner with chemiluminescence detection.",

Blood pressure was assessed weekly in two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) and control rats. After six weeks of hypertension, the relaxing responses to nitrite were assessed in aortic rings in the presence of the XOR inhibitor oxypurinol (or vehicle), either in the absence or in the presence of tempol. Moreover, in vivo hypotensive responses to nitrite were also examined in the presence of oxypurinol (or vehicle) and tempol (or vehicle). Aortic XOR activity and expression were evaluated by fluorescence and Western blot, respectively. Vascular ROS production was assessed by the dihydroethidium assay. 2K1C hypertensive rats showed increased aortic XOR activity and vascular ROS production compared with control rats. Oxypurinol shifted the nitrite concentration\u2013response curve to the right in aortic rings from 2K1C rats (but not in controls). Oxypurinol also attenuated the hypotensive responses to nitrite in 2K1C rats (but not in controls). These functional findings agree with increased aortic and plasma XOR activity found in 2K1C rats. Tempol treatment enhanced oxypurinol-induced shift of the nitrite concentration\u2013response curve to the right. However, antioxidant treatment did not affect XOR-mediated hypotensive effects of nitrite. Our results show that XOR is important to the cardiovascular responses to nitrite in 2K1C hypertension, and XOR inhibitors commonly used by patients may cancel this effect. This finding suggests that nitrite treatment may not be effective in patients being treated with XOR inhibitors. Moreover, while tempol may improve the vascular responses to nitrite, antihypertensive responses are not affected.",

     "abstract": "Dietary nitrate is now recognized as an alternative substrate for nitric oxide (\u2022NO) production in the gut. This novel pathway implies the sequential reduction of nitrate to nitrite, \u2022NO and other bioactive nitrogen oxides but the physiological relevance of these oxidants has remained elusive. We have previously shown that dietary nitrite fuels an hitherto unrecognized nitrating pathway at acidic gastric pH, through which pepsinogen is nitrated in the gastric mucosa, yielding a less active form of pepsin in vitro. Here, we demonstrate that pepsin is nitrated in vivo and explore the functional impact of protein nitration by means of peptic ulcer development. Upon administration of pentagastrin and human nitrite-rich saliva or sodium nitrite to rats, nitrated pepsin was detected in the animal's stomach by immunoprecipitation. \u2022NO was measured in the gastric headspace before and after nitrite instillation by chemiluminescence. At the end of each procedure, the stomach's lesions, ranging from gastric erosions to haemorrhagic ulcers, were scored. Nitrite increased gastric \u2022NO by 200-fold (p<0.05) and nitrated pepsin was detected both in the gastric juice and the mucosa (p<0.05). Exogenous urate, a scavenger of nitrogen dioxide radical, blunted \u2022NO detection and inhibited pepsin nitration, suggesting an underlining free radical-dependent mechanism for nitration. Functionally, pepsin nitration prevented the development of gastric ulcers, as the lesions were only apparent when pepsin nitration was inhibited by urate. In sum, this work unravels a novel dietary-dependent nitrating pathway in which pepsin is nitrated and inactivated in the stomach, preventing the progression of gastric ulcers.",

     "abstract": "Previous work has shown that red blood cells (RBCs) reduce nitrite to NO under conditions of low oxygen. Strong support for the ability of red blood cells to promote nitrite bioactivation comes from using platelet activation as a NO-sensitive process. Whereas addition of nitrite to platelet rich plasma in the absence of RBCs has no effect on inhibition of platelet activation, when RBCs are present platelet activation is inhibited by an NO-dependent mechanism that is potentiated under hypoxia. In this paper, we demonstrate that nitrite bioactivation by RBCs is blunted by physiologically-relevant concentrations of nutrients including glucose and the important signaling amino acid leucine. Our mechanistic investigations demonstrate that RBC mediated nitrite bioactivation is largely dependent on nitrosation of RBC surface proteins. These data suggest a new expanded paradigm where RBC mediated nitrite bioactivation not only directs blood flow to areas of low oxygen but also to areas of low nutrients. Our findings could have profound implications for normal physiology as well as pathophysiology in a variety of diseases including diabetes, sickle cell disease, and arteriosclerosis.",

We hypothesized that the upregulation of proteins associated with the UPRMT in response to reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity in Surf1\u2212/\u2212 mice might contribute to increased stress resistance. To test this hypothesis we asked whether primary cultures of fibroblasts from Surf1\u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit enhanced resistance to stressors compared to wild-type fibroblasts. Here we show that primary dermal fibroblasts isolated from Surf1\u2212/\u2212 mice have increased expression of UPRMT components ClpP and Hsp60, and increased expression of Lon protease. Fibroblasts from Surf1\u2212/\u2212 mice are significantly more resistant to cell death caused by oxidative stress induced by paraquat or tert-Butyl hydroperoxide compared to cells from wild-type mice. In contrast, Surf1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts show no difference in sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide stress. The enhanced cell survival in response to paraquat or tert-Butyl hydroperoxide in Surf1\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts compared to wild-type fibroblasts is associated with induced expression of Lon, ClpP, and Hsp60, increased maximal respiration, and increased reserve capacity as measured using the Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Overall these data support a protective role for the activation of the UPRMT in cell survival.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a hallmark of many liver diseases including viral and drug-induced hepatitis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. One of the consequences of oxidative stress in the liver is deregulation of Ca2+ homeostasis, resulting in a sustained elevation of the free cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) in hepatocytes, which leads to irreversible cellular damage. Recently it has been shown that liver damage induced by paracetamol and subsequent oxidative stress is, in large part, mediated by Ca2+ entry through Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channels. Involvement of TRPM2 channels in hepatocellular damage induced by oxidative stress makes TRPM2 a potential therapeutic target for treatment of a range of oxidative stress-related liver diseases. We report here the identification of curcumin ((1E,6E)-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,6-heptadiene-3,5-dione), a natural plant-derived polyphenol in turmeric spice, as a novel inhibitor of TRPM2 channel. Presence of 5\u00a0\u00b5M curcumin in the incubation medium prevented the H2O2- and paracetamol-induced [Ca2+]c rise in rat hepatocytes. Furthermore, in patch clamping experiments incubation of hepatocytes with curcumin inhibited activation of TRPM2 current by intracellular ADPR with IC50 of approximately 50\u00a0nM. These findings enhance understanding of the actions of curcumin and suggest that the known hepatoprotective properties of curcumin are, at least in part, mediated through inhibition of TRPM2 channels.",

In this study, bioavailability of the oxidized form of vitamin C (l-dehydroascorbic acid or DHA)\u2014commonly found in vitamin C containing food products prone to oxidation\u2014was studied. Our aim was to compare tissue accumulation of vitamin C in guinea pigs receiving different oral doses of either ascorbate or DHA. In all tissues tested (plasma, liver, spleen, lung, adrenal glands, kidney, muscle, heart, and brain), only sporadic differences in vitamin C accumulation from ascorbate or DHA were observed except for the lowest dose of DHA (0.25\u00a0mg/ml in the drinking water), where approximately half of the tissues had slightly yet significantly less vitamin C accumulation than from the ascorbate source. As these results contradicted data from rats, we continued to explore the ability to recycle DHA in blood, liver and intestine in guinea pigs, rats and mice. These investigations revealed that guinea pigs have similar recycling capacity in red blood cells as observed in humans, while rats and mice do not have near the same ability to reduce DHA in erythrocytes. In liver and intestinal homogenates, guinea pigs also showed a significantly higher ability to recycle DHA compared to rats and mice. These data demonstrate that DHA in guinea pigs\u2014as in humans\u2014is almost as effective as ascorbate as vitamin C source when it comes to taking up and storing vitamin C and further suggest that the guinea pig is superior to other rodents in modeling human vitamin C homeostasis.",

Besides four catalytic cysteines (Cys94, Cys99, Cys394, Cys397), Ero1\u03b1 harbors four regulatory cysteines (Cys104, Cys131, Cys208, Cys241). These cysteines mediate the formation of inhibitory intramolecular disulfide bonds, which adapt the activation state of the enzyme to the redox environment in the ER through feedback signaling. Accordingly, disulfide production by Ero1\u03b1 is accelerated by reducing conditions, which minimize the formation of inhibitory disulfides, or by mutations of regulatory cysteines. Here we report that reductive stimulation enhances Ero1\u03b1 activity more potently than the mutation of cysteines. Specifically, mutation of Cys208/Cys241 does not mechanistically mimic reductive stimulation, as it lowers the turnover rate of Ero1\u03b1 in presence of a reducing agent. The Cys208/Cys241 pair therefore fulfills a function during catalysis that reaches beyond negative regulation. In agreement, we identify a reciprocal crosstalk between the stabilities of the Cys208\u2013Cys241 disulfide and the inhibitory disulfide bonds involving Cys104 and Cys131, which also controls the recruitment of the H2O2 scavenger GPx8 to Ero1\u03b1. Two possible mechanisms by which thiol\u2013disulfide exchange at the Cys208/Cys241 pair stimulates the catalytic turnover under reducing conditions are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Malaria is a major health burden in tropical and subtropical countries. The antimalarial drug primaquine is extremely useful for killing the transmissible gametocyte forms of Plasmodium falciparum and the hepatic quiescent forms of P. vivax. Yet its mechanism of action is still poorly understood. In this study, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae model to help uncover the mode of action of primaquine. We found that the growth inhibitory effect of primaquine was restricted to cells that relied on respiratory function to proliferate and that deletion of SOD2 encoding the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase severely increased its effect, which can be countered by the overexpression of AIM32 and MCR1 encoding mitochondrial enzymes involved in the response to oxidative stress. This indicated that ROS produced by respiratory activity had a key role in primaquine-induced growth defect. We observed that \u0394sod2 cells treated with primaquine displayed a severely decreased activity of aconitase that contains a Fe\u2013S cluster notoriously sensitive to oxidative damage. We also showed that in vitro exposure to primaquine impaired the activity of purified aconitase and accelerated the turnover of the Fe\u2013S cluster of the essential protein Rli1. It is suggested that ROS-labile Fe\u2013S groups are the primary targets of primaquine. Aconitase activity is known to be essential at certain life-cycle stages of the malaria parasite. Thus primaquine-induced damage of its labile Fe\u2013S cluster \u2013 and of other ROS-sensitive enzymes \u2013 could inhibit parasite development.",

Previous data showed that at nanomolar fluxes of peroxynitrite, nitration of these phenolic compounds was outcompeted by dimerization (e.g. biphenols or dityrosine). Using 3-morpholino sydnonimine (Sin-1), we created low fluxes of peroxynitrite in our reaction set-up to demonstrate that salicylaldehyde displays unique features in the detection of physiological fluxes of peroxynitrite, yielding detectable nitration but only minor dimerization products.By means of HPLC analysis and detection at 380\u00a0nm we could identify the expected nitration products 3- and 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde, but also novel nitrated products. Using mass spectrometry, we also identified 2-nitrophenol and a not fully characterized nitrated dimerization product. The formation of 2-nitrophenol could proceed either by primary generation of a phenoxy radical, followed by addition of the NO2-radical to the various resonance structures, or by addition of the peroxynitrite anion to the polarized carbonyl group with subsequent fragmentation of the adduct (as seen with carbon dioxide). Interestingly, we observed almost no 3- and 5-nitrosalicylic acid products and only minor dimerization reaction.Our results disagree with the previous general assumption that nitration of low molecular weight phenolic compounds is always outcompeted by dimerization at nanomolar peroxynitrite fluxes and highlight unique features of salicylaldehyde as a probe for physiological concentrations of peroxynitrite.",

Sildenafil therapy can improve functional capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics in PAH patients. Nowadays, it is increasingly recognized that the effects of sildenafil are pleiotropic and may also involve changes of the pro-/antioxidant balance, lipid peroxidation and autonomic control. In present study we aimed to assess the effects of sildenafil on the fatty acids (FAs) status, level of hydroxynonenal (HNE) and heart rate variability (HRV) in PAH patients. Patients with PAH were characterized by an increase in HNE and changes in the FAs composition with elevation of linoleic, oleic, docosahexanoic acids in phospholipids as well as reduced HRV with sympathetic predominance. Sildenafil therapy improved exercise capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics and reduced NT-proBNP level in PAH. Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of sildenafil were noted from the significant lowering of HNE level and reduction of the phopholipid derived oleic, linoleic, docosahexanoic, docosapentanoic FAs. That was also associated with some improvement of HRV on account of the activation of the neurohumoral regulatory component. Incomplete recovery of the functional metabolic disorders in PAH patients may be assumed from the persistent increase in free FAs, reduced HRV with the sympathetic predominance in the spectral structure after treatment comparing to control group. The possibilities to improve PAH treatment efficacy through mild stimulation of free radical reactions and formation of hormetic reaction in the context of improved NO signaling are discussed.",

A primary mechanism of reactive aldehyde detoxification by hepatocytes is through GSTA4-driven enzymatic conjugation with GSH. Given reports that oxidative stress initiates GSTA4 translocation to the mitochondria, we hypothesized that increased hepatocellular damage in ethanol (EtOH)-fed GSTA4\u2212/\u2212 mice is due to enhanced mitochondrial protein modification by reactive aldehydes. Chronic ingestion of EtOH increased hepatic protein carbonylation in GSTA4\u2212/\u2212 mice as evidenced by increased 4-HNE and MDA immunostaining in the hepatic periportal region. Using mass spectrometric analysis of biotin hydrazide conjugated carbonylated proteins, a total of 829 proteins were identified in microsomal, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. Of these, 417 were novel to EtOH models. Focusing on mitochondrial fractions, 1.61-fold more carbonylated proteins were identified in EtOH-fed GSTA4\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to their respective WT mice ingesting EtOH. Bioinformatic KEGG pathway analysis of carbonylated proteins from the mitochondrial fractions revealed an increased propensity for modification of proteins regulating oxidative phosphorylation, glucose, fatty acid, glutathione and amino acid metabolic processes in GSTA4\u2212/\u2212 mice. Additional analysis revealed sites of reactive aldehyde protein modification on 26 novel peptides/proteins isolated from either SV/GSTA4\u2212/\u2212 PF or EtOH fed mice. Among the peptides/proteins identified, ACSL, ACOX2, MTP, and THIKB contribute to regulation of fatty acid metabolism and ARG1, ARLY, and OAT, which regulate nitrogen and ammonia metabolism having direct relevance to ethanol-induced liver injury.

Stress-induced premature cellular senescence (SIPS) is postulated to contribute to this condition. In this study, we hypothesized that oxidative damage, promoted by endogenous or exogenous sources, could elicit a senescence response in RPE cells, which would in turn dysregulate the expression of major players in AMD pathogenic mechanisms. We showed that exposure of a human RPE cell line (ARPE-19) to a cigarette smoke concentrate (CSC), not only enhanced Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels, but also induced 8-Hydroxydeoxyguanosine-immunoreactive (8-OHdG) DNA lesions and phosphorylated-Histone 2AX-immunoreactive (p-H2AX) nuclear foci. CSC-nuclear damage was followed by premature senescence as shown by positive senescence associated-\u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) staining, and p16INK4a and p21Waf-Cip1 protein upregulation. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) treatment, a ROS scavenger, decreased senescence markers, thus supporting the role of oxidative damage in CSC-induced senescence activation. ARPE-19 senescent cultures were also established by exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which is an endogenous stress source produced in the retina under photo-oxidation conditions. Senescent cells upregulated the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, the main markers of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Most important, we show for the first time that senescent ARPE-19 cells upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and simultaneously downregulated complement factor H (CFH) expression. Since both phenomena are involved in AMD pathogenesis, our results support the hypothesis that SIPS could be a principal player in the induction and progression of AMD.

This was accompanied by an increase in MitoSOX and DCFH2 oxidation that could be indicative of increased steady-state levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as O2\u2022\u2212 and H2O2, which correlated with increased levels of MnSOD activity and immuno-reactive protein. Furthermore PEG-catalase inhibited the DCFH2 oxidation signal to a greater extent in the ATRA-treated cells (relative to controls) at 96\u00a0h indicating that as the cells became more differentiated, steady-state levels of H2O2 increased in the absence of increases in peroxide-scavenging antioxidants (i.e., glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase). In addition, ATRA-induced stimulation of NF-M at 48 and 72\u00a0h was enhanced by decreasing SOD activity using siRNA directed at MnSOD. Finally, treatment with ATRA for 96\u00a0h in the presence of MnSOD siRNA or PEG-catalase inhibited ATRA induced increases in NF-M expression.

The dysfunctional fat tissue in obesity characterizes a failure to safely store metabolic substrates into existing hypertrophied adipocytes and/or into new preadipocytes recruited for differentiation. In this review we briefly summarize the potential of redox imbalance in fat tissue as an instigator of adipocyte dysfunction in obesity.

     "abstract": "Transcription factors of the forkhead box, class O (FoxO) family are important regulators of the cellular stress response and promote the cellular antioxidant defense. On one hand, FoxOs stimulate the transcription of genes coding for antioxidant proteins located in different subcellular compartments, such as in mitochondria (i.e. superoxide dismutase-2, peroxiredoxins 3 and 5) and peroxisomes (catalase), as well as for antioxidant proteins found extracellularly in plasma (e.g., selenoprotein P and ceruloplasmin). On the other hand, reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as other stressful stimuli that elicit the formation of ROS, may modulate FoxO activity at multiple levels, including posttranslational modifications of FoxOs (such as phosphorylation and acetylation), interaction with coregulators, alterations in FoxO subcellular localization, protein synthesis and stability. Moreover, transcriptional and posttranscriptional control of the expression of genes coding for FoxOs is sensitive to ROS. Here, we review these aspects of FoxO biology focusing on redox regulation of FoxO signaling, and with emphasis on the interplay between ROS and FoxOs under various physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Of particular interest are the dual role played by FoxOs in cancer development and their key role in whole body nutrient homeostasis, modulating metabolic adaptations and/or disturbances in response to low vs. high nutrient intake. Examples discussed here include calorie restriction and starvation as well as adipogenesis, obesity and type 2 diabetes.",

Disturbances such as continuously elevated ROS levels will result in oxidative stress and development of disease, but likewise, insufficient ROS production will be detrimental to health. Reduced or even complete loss of ROS generation originates mainly from inactivating variants in genes encoding for NADPH oxidase complexes. In particular, deficiency in phagocyte Nox2 oxidase function due to genetic variants (CYBB, CYBA, NCF1, NCF2, NCF4) has been recognized as a direct cause of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), an inherited immune disorder. More recently, additional diseases have been linked to functionally altered variants in genes encoding for other NADPH oxidases, such as for DUOX2/DUOXA2 in congenital hypothyroidism, or for the Nox2 complex, NOX1 and DUOX2 as risk factors for inflammatory bowel disease. A comprehensive overview of novel developments in terms of Nox/Duox-deficiency disorders is presented, combined with insights gained from structure\u2013function studies that will aid in predicting functional defects of clinical variants.",

We discuss the importance of the Nrf2-Keap1 pathway as an example of a transcriptional antioxidant response and we summarize transcriptional routes related to redox activation. As examples of pathophysiological cellular and tissular settings where antioxidant responses are major players we highlight endoplasmic reticulum stress and ischemia reperfusion. Topologically confined redox-mediated post-translational modifications of thiols are considered important molecular mechanisms mediating many antioxidant responses, whereas redox-sensitive microRNAs have emerged as key players in the posttranscriptional regulation of redox-mediated gene expression.

Study of their functionalities has intensified thanks to the development of various analytical strategies, with particular contribution from differential alkylation-based proteomics methods. Presented here is a critical evaluation of differential alkylation-based strategies for the analysis of S-nitrosylation and S-sulfenylation. The aim is to assess the current status and to provide insights for future directions in the dynamically evolving field of redox proteomics.

The Ca2+ signaling network works in many different ways to regulate cellular processes that function over a wide dynamic range due to the action of buffers, pumps and exchangers on the plasma membrane as well as in internal stores. Calcium signaling pathways interact with other cellular signaling systems such as reactive oxygen species (ROS). Although initially considered to be potentially detrimental byproducts of aerobic metabolism, it is now clear that ROS generated in sub-toxic levels by different intracellular systems act as signaling molecules involved in various cellular processes including growth and cell death. Increasing evidence suggests a mutual interplay between calcium and ROS signaling systems which seems to have important implications for fine tuning cellular signaling networks. However, dysfunction in either of the systems might affect the other system thus potentiating harmful effects which might contribute to the pathogenesis of various disorders.",

LOX enzymes are expressed in immune, epithelial, and tumor cells that display a variety of physiological functions, including inflammation, skin disorder, and tumorigenesis. In the humans and mice, six LOX isoforms have been known. 15-LOX, a prototypical enzyme originally found in reticulocytes shares the similarity of amino acid sequence as well as the biochemical property to plant LOX enzymes. 15-LOX-2, which is expressed in epithelial cells and leukocytes, has different substrate specificity in the humans and mice, therefore, the role of them in mammals has not been established. 12-LOX is an isoform expressed in epithelial cells and myeloid cells including platelets. Many mutations in this isoform are found in epithelial cancers, suggesting a potential link between 12-LOX and tumorigenesis. 12R-LOX can be found in the epithelial cells of the skin. Defects in this gene result in ichthyosis, a cutaneous disorder characterized by pathophysiologically dried skin due to abnormal loss of water from its epithelial cell layer. Similarly, eLOX-3, which is also expressed in the skin epithelial cells acting downstream 12R-LOX, is another causative factor for ichthyosis. 5-LOX is a distinct isoform playing an important role in asthma and inflammation. This isoform causes the constriction of bronchioles in response to cysteinyl leukotrienes such as LTC4, thus leading to asthma. It also induces neutrophilic inflammation by its recruitment in response to LTB4. Importantly, 5-LOX activity is strictly regulated by 5-LOX activating protein (FLAP) though the distribution of 5-LOX in the nucleus. Currently, pharmacological drugs targeting FLAP are actively developing. This review summarized these functions of LOX enzymes under pathophysiological conditions in mammals.",

ROS function as anti-microbial effector molecules and as signaling molecules that regulate such processes as NF-kB transcriptional activity, the production of DNA-based neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and autophagy. The main sources of cellular ROS are mitochondria and NADPH oxidases (NOXs). In contrast to NOX-generated ROS, ROS produced in the mitochondria (mtROS) were initially considered to be unwanted by-products of oxidative metabolism. Increasing evidence indicates that mtROS have been incorporated into signaling pathways including those regulating immune responses and autophagy. As metabolic hubs, mitochondria facilitate crosstalk between the metabolic state of the cell with these pathways. Mitochondria and ROS are thus a nexus of multiple pathways that determine the response of cells to disruptions in cellular homeostasis such as infection, sterile damage, and metabolic imbalance.

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a central role in the pathogenesis of diverse chronic inflammatory disorders including diabetic complications, cardiovascular disease, aging, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patients with moderate to advanced CKD have markedly increased levels of oxidative stress and inflammation that likely contribute to the unacceptable high rates of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. Oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance of the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in excess of the capacity of cells/tissues to detoxify or scavenge them. Such a state of oxidative stress may alter the structure/function of cellular macromolecules and tissues that eventually leads to organ dysfunction. The harmful effects of ROS have been largely attributed to its indiscriminate, stochastic effects on the oxidation of protein, lipids, or DNA but in many instances the oxidants target particular amino acid residues or lipid moieties. Oxidant mechanisms are intimately involved in cell signaling and are linked to several key redox-sensitive signaling pathways in fibrogenesis. Dysregulation of antioxidant mechanisms and overproduction of ROS not only promotes a fibrotic milieu but leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and further exacerbates kidney injury. Our studies support the hypothesis that unique reactive intermediates generated in localized microenvironments of vulnerable tissues such as the kidney activate fibrogenic pathways and promote end-organ damage. The ability to quantify these changes and assess response to therapies will be pivotal in understanding disease mechanisms and monitoring efficacy of therapy.",

Although signaling through Smad pathway is believed to play a central role in TGF-\u03b2's fibrogenesis, emerging evidence indicates that reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate TGF-\u03b2's signaling through different pathways including Smad pathway. TGF-\u03b21 increases ROS production and suppresses antioxidant enzymes, leading to a redox imbalance. ROS, in turn, induce/activate TGF-\u03b21 and mediate many of TGF-\u03b2's fibrogenic effects, forming a vicious cycle (see graphic flow chart on the right). Here, we review the current knowledge on the feed-forward mechanisms between TGF-\u03b21 and ROS in the development of fibrosis. Therapeutics targeting TGF-\u03b2-induced and ROS-dependent cellular signaling represents a novel approach in the treatment of fibrotic disorders.",

     "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is the pathological consequence of chronic liver diseases, where an excessive deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins occurs, concomitantly with the processes of repair and regeneration. It is characterized by increased production of matrix proteins, in particular collagens, and decreased matrix remodelling. The principal source of ECM accumulation is myofibroblasts (MFB). Most fibrogenic MFB are endogenous to the liver, coming from hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and portal fibroblasts. Dysregulated inflammatory responses have been associated with most (if not all) hepatotoxic insults and chronic oxidative stress play a role during the initial liver inflammatory phase and its progression to fibrosis. Redox-regulated processes are responsible for activation of HSC to MFB, as well as maintenance of the MFB function. Increased oxidative stress also induces hepatocyte apoptosis, which contributes to increase the liver injury and to transdifferentiate HSC to MFB, favouring the fibrogenic process. Mitochondria and other redox-active enzymes can generate superoxide and hydrogen peroxide as a by-product in liver cells. Moreover, accumulating evidence indicates that NADPH oxidases (NOXs), which play a critical role in the inflammatory response, may contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production during liver fibrosis, being important players in HSC activation and hepatocyte apoptosis. Based on the knowledge of the pathogenic role of ROS, different strategies to prevent or reverse the oxidative damage have been developed to be used as therapeutic tools in liver fibrosis. This review will update all these concepts, highlighting the relevance of redox biology in chronic fibrogenic liver pathologies.",

However, the underlying mode of action for its role as a radiosensitizer \u2013 while not entirely understood \u2013 is believed to arise from increased tumor blood flow, effects on cellular respiration, on cell signaling, and on the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS), that can act as radiosensitizers in their own right. NO activity is surprisingly long-lived and more potent in comparison to oxygen. Reports of the effects of NO with radiation have often been contradictory leading to confusion about the true radiosensitizing nature of NO. Whether increasing or decreasing tumor blood flow, acting as radiosensitizer or radioprotector, the effects of NO have been controversial. Key to understanding the role of NO as a radiosensitizer is to recognize the importance of biological context. With a very short half-life and potent activity, the local effects of NO need to be carefully considered and understood when using NO as a radiosensitizer. The systemic effects of NO donors can cause extensive side effects, and also affect the local tumor microenvironment, both directly and indirectly. To minimize systemic effects and maximize effects on tumors, agents that deliver NO on demand selectively to tumors using hypoxia as a trigger may be of greater interest as radiosensitizers. Herein we discuss the multiple effects of NO and focus on the clinical molecule RRx-001, a hypoxia-activated NO donor currently being investigated as a radiosensitizer in the clinic.",

The appropriate usage of redox-modulating compounds is limited by the lack of knowledge of their impact on specific molecular pathways. Increased levels of the IKK\u03b5 kinase, as a result of gene amplification or aberrant expression, are observed in a substantial number of breast carcinomas. IKK\u03b5 not only plays a key role in cell transformation and invasiveness, but also in the development of resistance to tamoxifen. Here, we studied the effect of in vitro treatment with the redox-modulating triphenylmethane dyes, Gentian Violet and Brilliant Green, and nitroxide Tempol on IKK\u03b5 expression and cell proliferation in the human breast cancer epithelial cell lines exhibiting amplification of IKK\u03b5, MCF-7 and ZR75.1. We show that Gentian Violet, Brilliant Green and Tempol significantly decrease intracellular superoxide anion levels and inhibit IKK\u03b5 expression and cell viability. Treatment with Gentian Violet and Brilliant Green was associated with a reduced cyclin D1 expression and activation of caspase 3 and/or 7. Tempol decreased cyclin D1 expression in both cell lines, while activation of caspase 7 was only observed in MCF-7 cells. Silencing of the superoxide-generating NOX2 NADPH oxidase expressed in breast cancer cells resulted in the significant reduction of IKK\u03b5 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that redox-modulating compounds targeting NOX2 could present a particular therapeutic interest in combination therapy against breast carcinomas exhibiting IKK\u03b5 amplification.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we present the novel findings that chronic ethanol consumption induces mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation in the kidney and correlates with significantly increased renal oxidative stress. A major proteomic footprint of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is an increase in hepatic mitochondrial protein acetylation. Protein hyperacetylation has been shown to alter enzymatic function of numerous proteins and plays a role in regulating metabolic processes. Renal mitochondrial targets of hyperacetylation include numerous metabolic and antioxidant pathways, such as lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and amino acid metabolism, as well as glutathione and thioredoxin pathways. Disruption of protein lysine acetylation has the potential to impair renal function through metabolic dysregulation and decreased antioxidant capacity. Due to a significant elevation in ethanol-mediated renal oxidative stress, we highlight the acetylation of superoxide dismutase, peroxiredoxins, glutathione reductase, and glutathione transferase enzymes. Since oxidative stress is a known factor in ethanol-induced nephrotoxicity, we examined biochemical markers of protein hyperacetylation and oxidative stress. Our results demonstrate increased protein acetylation concurrent with depleted glutathione, altered Cys redox potential, and the presence of 4-HNE protein modifications in our 6-week model of early-stage alcoholic nephrotoxicity. These findings support the hypothesis that ethanol metabolism causes an influx of mitochondrial metabolic substrate, resulting in mitochondrial protein hyperacetylation with the potential to impact mitochondrial metabolic and antioxidant processes.",

Recent studies have reported that GSNO regulates the activities of STAT3 and NF-\u03baB via S-nitrosylation dependent mechanisms. Since STAT3 and NF-\u03baB are key transcription factors involved in tumor progression, chemoresistance, and metastasis of head and neck cancer, we investigated the effect of GSNO in cell culture and mouse xenograft models of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). For the cell culture studies, three HNSCC cell lines were tested (SCC1, SCC14a and SCC22a). All three cell lines had constitutively activated (phosphorylated) STAT3 (Tyr705). GSNO treatment of these cell lines reversibly decreased the STAT3 phosphorylation in a concentration dependent manner. GSNO treatment also decreased the basal and cytokine-stimulated activation of NF-\u03baB in SCC14a cells and reduced the basal low degree of nitrotyrosine by inhibition of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression. The reduced STAT3/NF-\u03baB activity by GSNO treatment was correlated with the decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis of HNSCC cells. In HNSCC mouse xenograft model, the tumor growth was reduced by systemic treatment with GSNO and was further reduced when the treatment was combined with radiation and cisplatin. Accordingly, GSNO treatment also resulted in decreased levels of phosphorylated STAT3. In summary, these studies demonstrate that GSNO treatment blocks the NF-\u03baB and STAT3 pathways which are responsible for cell survival, proliferation and that GSNO mediated mechanisms complement cispaltin and radiation therapy, and thus could potentiate the therapeutic effect in HNSCC.",

We synthesized phosphine\u2013borane complexes that reduce disulfide bonds and had previously been shown to interfere with redox-mediated signaling of cell death. We hypothesized that this class of drugs could interfere with the downstream effects of oxidative stress after irradiation and rescue endothelial cells from radiation damage. Cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells were plated for clonogenic assay prior to exposure to varying doses of irradiation from a 137Cs irradiator and treated with various concentrations of bis(3-propionic acid methyl ester)phenylphosphine borane complex (PB1) at different time points. The clone-forming ability of the irradiated cells was assessed seven days after irradiation. We compared the radioprotective effects of PB1 with the aminothiol radioprotectant WR1065 and known superoxide scavengers. PB1 significantly protected bovine aortic endothelial cells from radiation damage, particularly when treated both before and after radiation. The radioprotection with 1\u00a0\u00b5M PB1 corresponded to a dose-reduction factor of 1.24. Radioprotection by PB1 was comparable to the aminothiol WR1065, but was significantly less toxic and required much lower concentrations of drug (1\u00a0\u00b5M vs. 4\u00a0mM, respectively). Superoxide scavengers were not radioprotective in this paradigm, indicating the mechanisms for both loss of clonogenicity and PB1 radioprotection are independent of superoxide signaling. These data demonstrate that PB1 is an effective redox-active radioprotectant for endothelial cells in vitro, and is radioprotective at a concentration approximately 4 orders of magnitude lower than the aminothiol WR1065 with less toxicity.",

Isoniazid treatment generates reactive oxygen species and induces apoptosis in Hep3B cells. It induces antioxidative and apoptotic genes leading to increase in mRNA expression and protein levels in Hep3B cells. Whole genome expression analysis of Hep3B cells treated with Isoniazid has resulted in differential expression of various genes playing prime role in regulation of apoptotic, antioxidative, DNA damage, cell signaling, cell proliferation and differentiation pathways. Isoniazid increased cytosolic Nrf2 protein level while decreased nuclear Nrf2 protein level. It also decreased ERK1 phosphorylation and treatment of Hep3B cells with ERK inhibitor followed by Isoniazid resulting in increased apoptosis in these cells. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis results have also shown differential expression of various protein species including heat shock proteins, proteins playing important role in oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis, cell proliferation and differentiation. Results suggest that Isoniazid induces apoptosis through oxidative stress and also prevents Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus by reducing ERK1 phosphorylation thus preventing cytoprotective effect.",

White blood cells were incubated with dihydrorhodamine (DHR) in order to study H2O2 synthesis and E. coli-FITC to study phagocytosis. Flow cytometry revealed increased synthesis of H2O2 in polymorphonuclears which incorporated E. coli-FITC. The blocking of H2O2 synthesis by specific inhibitors, N-ethylmaleimide (\u039d\u0395\u039c) for NADPH oxidase and diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC) for superoxide dismutase (SOD), decreased E. coli phagocytosis, as well. Immunoblot analysis of white blood cell protein extracts revealed that the blocking of NADPH oxidase and SOD decreased ERK-1/2 phosphorylation, while it had no effect on JNK and p38. Confocal microscopy showed that phosphorylation of MAPKs and phagocytosis solely occur in the polymorphonuclear and not in mononuclear cells. The use of specific MAPKs inhibitors showed that all of them are necessary for phagocytosis, but only phospho-p38 affects H2O2 synthesis. The blocking of JNK phosphorylation, in the presence of E. coli, evoked a further decrease of cytoplasmic p47 thus increasing its translocation onto the plasma membrane for the assembly of NADPH oxidase. It appears that newly synthesised H2O2 invigorates the phosphorylation and action of ERK-1/2 in E. coli phagocytosis, while phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 appear to regulate H2O2 production.",

Both these processes were found to be nitric oxide (NO) dependent. Further analysis demonstrated that the NO-dependent increase in iron deposition was mediated through increased transferrin receptor expression and a decrease in ferritin expression. This was correlated with a reduction in aconitase activity. Both NO inhibition and iron scavenging, using deferoxamine administration, reduced hydroxyl radical levels and neuronal cell death. In conclusion, our results suggest that increased NO generation leads to neuronal cell death during neonatal HI, at least in part, by altering iron homeostasis and hydroxyl radical generation.",

The action of NO occurs mainly through redox changes in target proteins, particularly by S-nitrosylation of reactive cysteine residues. Thioredoxin (Trx) and glutaredoxin (Grx) systems are the main cellular controllers of the thiolic redox state of proteins exerting controversial effects on apoptosis with consequences for the resistance to or the development of cancer.The aim of this study was to ascertain whether Trx and/or Grx systems mediate the antiproliferative effect of NO on hepatoblastoma cells by modulating the redox-state of key proteins.Proliferation decreased and apoptosis increased in HepG2 cells overexpressing Nitric Oxide Synthase-3 (NOS-3) as a result of multilevel cellular responses to the oxidative environment generated by NO. Enzyme levels and cysteine redox state at several metabolic checkpoints were consistent with prominence of the pentose phosphate pathway to direct the metabolic flux toward NADPH for antioxidant defense and lowering of nucleotide biosynthesis and hence proliferation. Proteins involved in cell survival pathways, proteins of the redoxin systems and phosphorylation of MAPK were all significantly increased accompanied by a shift of the thiolic redox state of Akt1, Trx1 and Grx1 to more oxidized.Silencing of Trx1 and Grx1 neutralized the increases in CD95, Akt1 and pAkt levels induced by NO and produced a marked increase in caspase-3 and -8 activities in both control and NOS-3 overexpressing cells concomitant with a decrease in the number of cells.These results demonstrate that the antiproliferative effect of NO is actually hampered by Trx1 and Grx1 and support the strategy of weakening the thiolic antioxidant defenses when designing new antitumoral therapies.",

In contrast, extracellular singlet oxygen generation caused apoptosis induction selectively in tumor cells through singlet oxygen-mediated inactivation of tumor cell protective catalase and subsequent reactivation of intercellular ROS-mediated apoptosis signaling through the HOCl and the NO/peroxynitrite signaling pathway. Singlet oxygen generation by extracellular photofrin alone was, however, not sufficient for optimal direct inactivation of catalase, but needed to trigger the generation of cell-derived extracellular singlet oxygen through the interaction between H2O2 and peroxynitrite. Thereby, formation of peroxynitrous acid, generation of hydroxyl radicals and formation of perhydroxyl radicals (HO2.) through hydroxyl radical/H2O2 interaction seemed to be required as intermediate steps. This amplificatory mechanism led to the formation of singlet oxygen at a sufficiently high concentration for optimal inactivation of membrane-associated catalase. At low initial concentrations of singlet oxygen, an additional amplification step needed to be activated. It depended on singlet oxygen-dependent activation of the FAS receptor and caspase-8, followed by caspase-8-mediated enhancement of NOX activity.

SIRT1 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in HF with more robust decrease in dHF (p=0.002, control vs cHF; p<0.001, control vs dHF). Markedly increased oxidative stress defined as elevated TOS, OSI and low TAS levels were detected in HF patients comparing with the controls (TAS; p=0.010, control vs cHF, p=0.045 control vs dHF, TOS; p=0.004 control vs cHF; p<0.001 control vs dHF, OSI; p<0.001 for both comparisons, respectively). With SIRT1 expression levels, TAS, TOS, OSI, and high density lipoprotein levels in cHF and dHF were determined correlated. SIRT1 expression were significantly reduced in both HF subtypes, particularly in dHF. SIRT1 expression was correlated with the oxidant levels and antioxidant capacity. Data suggest that SIRT1 may have a significant contribution in regulation of oxidant/antioxidant balance in HF etiology and compensation status.",

     "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) plays a relevant role during cell death regulation in tumor cells. The overexpression of nitric oxide synthase type III (NOS-3) induces oxidative and nitrosative stress, p53 and cell death receptor expression and apoptosis in hepatoblastoma cells. S-nitrosylation of cell death receptor modulates apoptosis. Sorafenib is the unique recommended molecular-targeted drug for the treatment of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. The present study was addressed to elucidate the potential role of NO during Sorafenib-induced cell death in HepG2 cells. We determined the intra- and extracellular NO concentration, cell death receptor expression and their S-nitrosylation modifications, and apoptotic signaling in Sorafenib-treated HepG2 cells. The effect of NO donors on above parameters has also been determined. Sorafenib induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. However, low concentration of the drug (10\u00a0nM) increased cell death receptor expression, as well as caspase-8 and -9 activation, but without activation of downstream apoptotic markers. In contrast, Sorafenib (10\u00a0\u00b5M) reduced upstream apoptotic parameters but increased caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation in HepG2 cells. The shift of cell death signaling pathway was associated with a reduction of S-nitrosylation of cell death receptors in Sorafenib-treated cells. The administration of NO donors increased S-nitrosylation of cell death receptors and overall induction of cell death markers in control and Sorafenib-treated cells. In conclusion, Sorafenib induced alteration of cell death receptor S-nitrosylation status which may have a relevant repercussion on cell death signaling in hepatoblastoma cells.",

Antioxidant therapy might be a useful strategy for type 2 diabetes and other insulin-resistant states. The combination of vitamin C (Vc) and vitamin E has synthetic scavenging effect on free radicals and inhibition effect on lipid peroxidation. However, there are few studies about how to define the best combination of more than three anti-oxidants as it is difficult or impossible to test the anti-oxidant effect of the combination of every concentration of each ingredient experimentally. Here we present a math model, which is based on the classical Hill equation to determine the best combination, called Fixed Dose Combination (FDC), of several natural anti-oxidants, including Vc, green tea polyphenols (GTP) and grape seed extract proanthocyanidin (GSEP). Then we investigated the effects of FDC on oxidative stress, blood glucose and serum lipid levels in cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes, high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats which serve as obesity model, and KK-ay mice as diabetic model. The level of serum malondialdehyde (MDA) in the treated rats was studied and Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining or Oil red slices of liver and adipose tissue in the rats were examined as well. FDC shows excellent antioxidant and anti-glycation activity by attenuating lipid peroxidation. FDC determined in this investigation can become a potential solution to reduce obesity, to improve insulin sensitivity and be beneficial for the treatment of fat and diabetic patients. It is the first time to use the math model to determine the best ratio of three anti-oxidants, which can save much more time and chemical materials than traditional experimental method. This quantitative method represents a potentially new and useful strategy to screen all possible combinations of many natural anti-oxidants, therefore may help develop novel therapeutics with the potential to ameliorate the worldwide metabolic abnormalities.",

     "abstract": "Control of colorectal cancer needs to be tailored to its etiology. Tumor promotion mechanisms in colitis-associated colon cancer differ somewhat from the mechanisms involved in hereditary and sporadic colorectal cancer. Unlike sporadic or inherited tumors, some experimental models show that colitis-associated colon tumors do not require cyclooxygenase (COX) expression for progression, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) which prevent sporadic or inherited colon cancer do not prevent colitis-associated colon cancer. We report that myeloperoxidase (MPO), an ancestor of the COX isoenzymes, is a determinant of colitis-associated colon tumors in ApcMin/+ mice. During experimentally induced colitis, inhibition of MPO by resorcinol dampened colon tumor development. Conversely, in the bowels of ApcMin/+ mice without colitis, resorcinol administration or \u2018knockout\u2019 of MPO gene coincided with a slight, but discernible increase in colon tumor incidence. Acrolein, a by-product of MPO catalysis, formed a covalent adduct with the phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor and enhanced the activity of the Akt kinase proto-oncogene in vitro and in vivo. Thus, MPO may be an important determinant of diet and inflammation on colon cancer risk via its effect on endogenous exposure to oxidants and acrolein. We propose a hypothetical model to explain an apparent dichotomy between colon tumor occurrence and MPO inhibition in inflamed versus non-inflamed colons.",

An increase was also seen in superoxide in response to treatment with TNF-\u03b1, which was localised to the mitochondria and this was also associated with activation of NF-\u03baB. The changes in superoxide, activation of NF-kB and release of myokines were attenuated following pre-treatment with SS-31 peptide indicating that the ability of TNF-\u03b1 to induce myokine release may be mediated through mitochondrial superoxide, which is, at least in part, associated with activation of the redox sensitive transcription factor NF-kB.",

High-risk non-muscle invasive bladder-cancer (NMIBC)-patients failing to respond to BCG-treatment have worse prognosis than those undergoing immediate radical cystectomy and identification of patients at risk for BCG-failure is of high priority. Several studies indicate a role for nitric oxide (NO) in the cytotoxic effect that BCG exerts on bladder cancer cells. In this study we investigated whether NO-synthase (NOS)-gene polymorphisms, NOS2-promoter microsatellite (CCTTT)n, and the NOS3-polymorphisms-786T>C (rs2070744) and Glu298Asp (rs1799983), can serve as possible molecular markers for outcome after BCG-treatment for NMIBC.All NMIBC-patients from a well-characterized population based cohort were analyzed (n=88). Polymorphism data were combined with information from 15-years of clinical follow-up. The effect of BCG-treatment on cancer-specific death (CSD), recurrence and progression in patients with varying NOS-genotypes were studied using Cox proportional hazard-models and log rank tests.BCG-treatment resulted in significantly better survival in patients without (Log rank: p=0.006; HR: 0.12, p=0.048), but not in patients with a long version ((CCTTT)n \u226713 repeats) of the NOS2-promoter microsatellite.

However, mitochondrial dysfunction is now being recognized as an important contributing factor in the development cardiovascular diseases, such as pulmonary hypertension (PH). In PH there is a metabolic change from oxidative phosphorylation to mainly glycolysis for energy production. However, the mechanisms underlying this glycolytic switch are only poorly understood. In particular the role of the respiratory Complexes in the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with PH is unresolved and was the focus of our investigations. We report that smooth muscle cells isolated from the pulmonary vessels of rats with PH (PH-PASMC), induced by a single injection of monocrotaline, have attenuated mitochondrial function and enhanced glycolysis. Further, utilizing a novel live cell assay, we were able to demonstrate that the mitochondrial dysfunction in PH-PASMC correlates with deficiencies in the activities of Complexes I\u2013III. Further, we observed that there was an increase in mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation and mitochondrial membrane potential in the PASMC isolated from rats with PH. We further found that the defect in Complex I activity was due to a loss of Complex I assembly, although the assembly of Complexes II and III were both maintained. Thus, we conclude that loss of Complex I assembly may be involved in the switch of energy metabolism in smooth muscle cells to glycolysis and that maintaining Complex I activity may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of PH.",

Here we compare the gastrointestinal safety, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-pyretic, anti-platelet, and anti-cancer properties of sulindac and NOSH-sulindac administered orally to rats at equimolar doses. Gastrointestinal safety: 6\u00a0h post-administration, number/size of hemorrhagic lesions in stomachs were counted. Tissue samples were frozen for PGE2, SOD, and MDA determination. Anti-inflammatory: 1\u00a0h after drug administration, the volume of carrageenan-induced rat paw edemas was measured for 5\u00a0h. Anti-pyretic: fever was induced by LPS (ip) an hour before administration of the test drugs, core body temperature was measured hourly for 5\u00a0h. Analgesic: time-dependent analgesic effects were evaluated by carrageenan-induced hyperalgesia. Antiplatelet: anti-aggregatory effects were studied on collagen-induced platelet aggregation of human platelet-rich plasma. Anti-cancer: We examined the effects of NOSH-sulindac on the growth properties of 12 human cancer cell lines of six different tissue origins. Both agents reduced PGE2 levels in stomach tissue; however, NOSH-sulindac did not cause any stomach ulcers, whereas sulindac caused significant bleeding. Lipid peroxidation induced by sulindac was higher than that from NOSH-sulindac. SOD activity was significantly lowered by sulindac but increased by NOSH-sulindac. Both agents showed similar anti-inflammatory, analgesic, anti-pyretic, and anti-platelet activities. Sulindac increased plasma TNF\u03b1 whereas this rise was lower in the NOSH-sulindac-treated animals. NOSH-sulindac inhibited the growth of all cancer cell lines studied, with potencies of 1000- to 9000-fold greater than that of sulindac. NOSH-sulindac inhibited cell proliferation, induced apoptosis, and caused G2/M cell cycle block.

     "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) against cancer has gained attention due to the successful outcome in some cancers, particularly those on the skin. However, there have been limitations to PDT applications in deep cancers and, occasionally, PDT treatment resulted in tumor recurrence. A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of PDT-induced cytotoxicity and cytoprotection should facilitate the development of better approaches to inhibit the cytoprotective effects and also augment PDT-mediated cytotoxicity. PDT treatment results in the induction of iNOS/NO in both the tumor and the microenvironment. The role of NO in cytotoxicity and cytoprotection was examined. The findings revealed that NO mediates its effects by interfering with a dysregulated pro-survival/anti-apoptotic NF-\u03baB/Snail/YY1/RKIP loop which is often expressed in cancer cells. The cytoprotective effect of PDT-induced NO was the result of low levels of NO that activates the pro-survival/anti-apoptotic NF-\u03baB, Snail, and YY1 and inhibits the anti-survival/pro-apoptotic and metastasis suppressor RKIP. In contrast, PDT-induced high levels of NO result in the inhibition of NF-kB, Snail, and YY1 and the induction of RKIP, all of which result in significant anti-tumor cytotoxicity. The direct role of PDT-induced NO effects was corroborated by the use of the NO inhibitor, l-NAME, which reversed the PDT-mediated cytotoxic and cytoprotective effects. In addition, the combination of the NO donor, DETANONOate, and PDT potentiated the PDT-mediated cytotoxic effects. These findings revealed a new mechanism of PDT-induced NO effects and suggested the potential therapeutic application of the combination of NO donors/iNOS inducers and PDT in the treatment of various cancers. In addition, the study suggested that the combination of PDT with subtoxic cytotoxic drugs will result in significant synergy since NO has been shown to be a significant chemo-immunosensitizing agent to apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "We recently reported the synthesis of NOSH-aspirin, a novel hybrid that releases both nitric oxide (NO) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). In NOSH-aspirin, the two moieties that release NO and H2S are covalently linked at the 1, 2 positions of acetyl salicylic acid, i.e. ortho-NOSH-aspirin (o-NOSH-aspirin). In the present study, we compared the effects of the positional isomers of NOSH-ASA (o-NOSH-aspirin, m-NOSH-aspirin and p-NOSH-aspirin) to that of aspirin on growth of HT-29 and HCT 15 colon cancer cells, belonging to the same histological subtype, but with different expression of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes; HT-29 express both COX-1 and COX-2, whereas HCT 15 is COX-null. We also analyzed the effect of these compounds on proliferation and apoptosis in HT-29 cells. Since the parent compound aspirin, inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2, we also evaluated the effects of these compounds on COX-1 and COX-2 enzyme activities and also performed modeling of the interactions between the positional isomers of NOSH-aspirin and COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes. We observed that the three positional isomers of NOSH aspirin inhibited the growth of both colon cancer cell lines with IC50s in the nano-molar range. In particular in HT-29 cells the IC50s for growth inhibition were: o-NOSH-ASA, 0.04\u00b10.011\u00a0\u00b5M; m-NOSH-ASA, 0.24\u00b10.11\u00a0\u00b5M; p-NOSH-ASA, 0.46\u00b10.17\u00a0\u00b5M; and in HCT 15 cells the IC50s for o-NOSH-ASA, m-NOSH-ASA, and p-NOSH-ASA were 0.062 \u00b10.006\u00a0\u00b5M, 0.092\u00b10.004\u00a0\u00b5M, and 0.37\u00b10.04\u00a0\u00b5M, respectively. The IC50 for aspirin in both cell lines was >5\u00a0mM at 24\u00a0h. The reduction of cell growth appeared to be mediated through inhibition of proliferation, and induction of apoptosis. All 3 positional isomers of NOSH-aspirin preferentially inhibited COX-1 over COX-2. These results suggest that the three positional isomers of NOSH-aspirin have the same biological actions, but that o-NOSH-ASA displayed the strongest anti-neoplastic potential.",

Although hyperoxidation restricts the antioxidant physiological role of these enzymes, it also allows the enzyme to become an efficient chaperone holdase.

How hyperoxidation promotes HMW assembly is not well understood and Prx mutants allowing disentangling its peroxidase and chaperone functions are lacking. To begin addressing the link between enzyme hyperoxidation and HMW structures formation, we have evaluated the in vivo 2-Cys Prxs quaternary structure changes induced by H2O2 by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on crude lysates, using wild type (Wt) untagged and Myc-tagged S. cerevisiae 2-Cys Prx Tsa1 and derivative Tsa1 mutants or genetic conditions known to inactivate peroxidase or chaperone activity or altering the enzyme sensitivity to hyperoxidation.

The regulatory potential of catalase at the crosspoint of ROS and RNS chemical biology, as well as its high local concentration on the outside of the cell membrane of tumor cells, establish tight control of intercellular signaling and thus prevent tumor cell apoptosis. Therefore, inhibition of catalase or its inactivation by singlet oxygen reactivate intercellular apoptosis-inducing signaling. Nitric oxide and peroxynitrite are connected with catalase in multiple and meaningful ways, as (i) NO can be oxidated by compound I of catalase, (ii) NO can reversibly inhibit catalase, (iii) peroxynitrite can be decomposed by catalase and (iv) the interaction between peroxynitrite and H2O2 leads to the generation of singlet oxygen that inactivates catalase. Therefore, modulation of the concentration of free NO through addition of arginine, inhibition of arginase, induction of NOS expression or inhibition of NO dioxygenase triggers an autoamplificatory biochemical cascade that is based on initial formation of singlet oxygen, amplification of superoxide anion/H2O2 and NO generation through singlet oxygen dependent stimulation of the FAS receptor and caspase-8. Finally, singlet oxygen is generated at sufficiently high concentration to inactivate protective catalase and to reactivate intercellular apoptosis-inducing ROS signaling. This regulatory network allows to establish several pathways for synergistic interactions, like the combination of modulators of NO metabolism with enhancers of superoxide anion generation, modulators of NO metabolism that act at different targets and between modulators of NO metabolism and direct catalase inhibitors. The latter aspect is explicitely studied for the interaction between catalase inhibiting acetylsalicylic acid and an NO donor. It is also shown that hybrid molecules like NO-aspirin utilize this synergistic potential. Our data open novel approaches for rational tumor therapy based on specific ROS signaling and its control in tumor cells.",

Atorvastatin and sildenafil exert antioxidant and pleiotropic effects that may result in cardiovascular protection. We hypothesized that atorvastatin and sildenafil alone or in association exert antiproliferative effects by down-regulating MMP-2 and TGF-\u03b2, thus reducing the vascular hypertrophy induced by two kidney, one clip (2K1C) hypertension.Sham and 2K1C rats were treated with oral atorvastatin 50\u00a0mg/kg, sildenafil 45\u00a0mg/kg, or both, daily for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was monitored weekly. Morphologic changes in the aortas were studied. TGF-\u03b2 levels were determined by immunofluorescence. MMP-2 activity and expression were determined by in situ zymography, gel zymography, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The effects of both drugs on proliferative responses of aortic smooth muscle cells to PDGF and on on MMP-2 activity in vitro were determined. Atorvastatin, sildenafil, or both drugs exerted antiproliferative effects in vitro. All treatments attenuated 2K1C-induced hypertension and prevented the increases in the aortic cross-sectional area and media/lumen ratio in 2K1C rats. Aortas from 2K1C rats showed higher collagen deposition, TGF-\u03b2 levels and MMP-2 activity and expression when compared with Sham-operated animals. Treatment with atorvastatin and/or sildenafil was associated with attenuation of 2K1C hypertension-induced increases in these pro-fibrotic factors. However, these drugs had no in vitro effects on hr-MMP-2 activity.Atorvastatin and sildenafil was associated with decreased vascular TGF-\u03b2 levels and MMP-2 activity in renovascular hypertensive rats, thus ameliorating the vascular remodeling.

     "abstract": "Cells that are not irradiated but are affected by \u201cstress signal factors\u201d released from irradiated cells are called bystander cells. These cells, as well as directly irradiated ones, express DNA damage-related proteins and display excess DNA damage, chromosome aberrations, mutations, and malignant transformation. This phenomenon has been studied widely in the past 20 years, since its first description by Nagasawa and Little in 1992, and is known as the radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE). Several factors have been identified as playing a role in the bystander response. This review will focus on one of them, nitric oxide (NO), and its role in the stimulation and propagation of RIBE. The hydrophobic properties of NO, which permit its diffusion through the cytoplasm and plasma membranes, allow this signaling molecule to easily spread from irradiated cells to bystander cells without the involvement of gap junction intercellular communication. NO produced in irradiated tissues mediates cellular regulation through posttranslational modification of a number of regulatory proteins. The best studied of these modifications are S-nitrosylation (reversible oxidation of cysteine) and tyrosine nitration. These modifications can up- or down-regulate the functions of many proteins modulating different NO-dependent effects. These NO-dependent effects include the stimulation of genomic instability (GI) and the accumulation of DNA errors in bystander cells without direct DNA damage.",

There is emerging evidence supporting differential roles for visceral and subcutaneous white adipose tissue in maintaining health, although how these roles are modulated by the aging process is not clear. However, the proposed beneficial effects of subcutaneous fat suggest that targeting maintenance of this tissue could lead to healthier aging. In this study, we tested whether alterations in adipose function with age might be associated with changes in oxidative stress. Using visceral and subcutaneous adipose from C57BL/6 mice, we discovered effects of both age and depot location on markers of lipolysis and adipogenesis. Conversely, accumulation of oxidative damage and changes in enzymatic antioxidant expression with age were largely similar between these two depots. The activation of each of the stress signaling pathways JNK and MAPK/ERK was relatively suppressed in subcutaneous adipose tissue suggesting reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress. Similarly, pre-adipocytes from subcutaneous adipose were significantly more resistant than visceral-derived cells to cell death caused by oxidative stress. Cellular respiration in visceral-derived cells was dramatically higher than in cells derived from subcutaneous adipose despite little evidence for differences in mitochondrial density. Together, our data identify molecular mechanisms by which visceral and subcutaneous adipose differ with age and suggest potential targetable means to preserve healthy adipose aging.",

     "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) are overexpressed in the majority of renal cell carcinomas. This characteristic has supported the rationale of targeting VEGF-driven tumour vascularization, especially in clear cell RCC. VEGF-inhibiting strategies include the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, axitinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib) and neutralizing antibodies such as bevacizumab.Hypertension (HTN) is one of the most common adverse effects of angiogenesis inhibitors. HTN observed in clinical trials appears to correlate with the potency of VEGF kinase inhibitor against VEGFR-2: agents with higher potency are associated with a higher incidence of HTN. Although the exact mechanism by tyrosine kinase inhibitors induce HTN has not yet been completely clarified, two key hypotheses have been postulated. First, some studies have pointed to a VEGF inhibitors-induced decrease in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, that can result in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. VEGF, mediated by PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathway, upregulates the endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme leading to up-regulation of NO production. So inhibition of signaling through the VEGF pathway would lead to a decrease in NO production, resulting in an increase in vascular resistance and blood pressure. Secondly a decrease in the number of microvascular endothelial cells and subsequent depletion of normal microvessel density (rarefaction) occurs upon VEGF signaling inhibition.NO donors could be successfully used not only for the treatment of developed angiogenesis-inhibitor-induced hypertension but also for preventive effects.",

Since MB is redox-active, we investigated its effect on the NAD/NADH ratio in IMR90 cells. The transient increase in NAD/NADH observed in MB-treated cells triggered an investigation of the energy regulator AMPK. MB induced AMPK phosphorylation in a transient pattern, which was followed by the induction of PGC1\u03b1 and SURF1: both are inducers of mitochondrial and complex-IV biogenesis. Subsequently MB-treated cells exhibited >100% increase in complex-IV activity and a 28% decline in cellular oxidants. The telomeres erosion rate was also significantly lower in MB-treated cells. A previous research suggested that the pattern of AMPK activation (i.e., chronic or transient) determines the AMPK effect on cell senescence. We identified that the anti-senescence activity of MB (transient activator) was 8-times higher than that of AICAR (chronic activator). Since MB lacked an effect on cell cycle, an MB-dependent change to cell cycle is unlikely to contribute to the anti-senescence activity. The current findings in conjunction with the activation of Keap1/Nrf2 suggest a synchronized activation of the energy and cellular defense pathways as a possible key factor in MB's potent anti-senescence activity.",

     "abstract": "Nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) is marked by low T3 and high reverse T3 levels. The physiopathology is poorly understood but involves oxidative stress-induced disruption of the iodothyronine deiodinases, which activate or inactivate thyroid hormones. Selenium, an essential trace element, exerts antioxidant function mainly through the thioredoxin reductase (TRx) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) redox-regulating systems. We evaluated the effect of sodium selenite on IL6-induced disruption on deiodinase function. Cell lines expressing endogenous deiodinases type 1(D1), 2(D2) or 3(D3) (HepG2, MSTO, and MCF-7 cells, respectively) were used in an intact cell model that mimics the deiodination process under physiological conditions of substrate and cofactor, in the presence or not of IL6, with or without selenite. Deiodinase activity was quantified by the amount of iodine-125 in the medium (D1 and D2) or by ion-exchange chromatography (D3). Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring reactive species (RS), carbonyl content as well as enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defenses. Results: IL6 induced ROS and carbonyl content in all 3 cell lines (all P<0.001). Increased ROS was paralleled by D1 and D2-decreased T3-production (P<0.01) and increased D3-catalyzed T3-inactivation (P<0.001). Selenite decreases the IL6-induced ROS and carbonyl content, while enhances Gpx and Trx activities. Nevertheless, it failed on restoring D1 or D2 function and only attenuates D3 activation (P<0.05). In conclusion, although sodium selenite reduces IL6-induced redox imbalance it does not fully repair deiodinase function. These results shed light on NTIS physiopathology and might explain why low T3 levels are unaffected by selenium supplementation in sick patients.",

     "abstract": "The generation of NO by the various NO synthases in normal and malignant tissues is manifested by various biological effects that are involved in the regulation of cell survival, differentiation and cell death. The role of NO in the cytotoxic immune response was first revealed by demonstrating the induction of iNOS in target cells by immune cytokines (e.g. IFN-\u03b3, IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, etc.) and resulting in the sensitization of resistant tumor cells to death ligands-induced apoptosis. Endogenous/exogenous NO mediated its immune sensitizing effect by inhibiting NF-\u03ba\u0392 activity and downstream, inactivating the repressor transcription factor YY1, which inhibited both Fas and DR5 expressions. In addition, NO-mediated inhibition of NF-\u03ba\u0392 activity and inhibition downstream of its anti-apoptotic gene targets sensitized the tumor cells to apoptosis by chemotherapeutic drugs. We have identified in tumor cells a dysregulated pro-survival/anti-apoptotic loop consisting of NF-\u03baB/Snail/YY1/RKIP/PTEN and its modification by NO was responsible, in large, for the reversal of chemo and immune resistance and sensitization to apoptotic mechanisms by cytotoxic agents. Moreover, tumor cells treated with exogenous NO donors resulted in the inhibition of NF-\u03ba\u0392 activity via S-nitrosylation of p50 and p65, inhibition of Snail (NF-\u03ba\u0392 target gene), inhibition of transcription repression by S-nitrosylation of YY1 and subsequent inhibition of epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), induction of RKIP (inhibition of the transcription repressor Snail), and induction of PTEN (inhibition of the repressors Snail and YY1). Further, each gene product modified by NO in the loop was involved in chemo-immunosensitization. These above findings demonstrated that NO donors interference in the regulatory circuitry result in chemo-immunosensitization and inhibition of EMT. Overall, these observations suggest the potential anti-tumor therapeutic effect of NO donors in combination with subtoxic chemo-immuno drugs. This combination acts on multiple facets including reversal of chemo-immune resistance, and inhibition of both EMT and metastasis.",

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine if ROS is involved in the activation of autophagy in HI-mediated neonatal brain injury and to determine if this is a protective or deleterious pathway. Initial electron microscopy data demonstrated that autophagosome formation is elevated in P7 hippocampal slice cultures exposed to oxygen\u2013glucose deprivation (OGD). This corresponded with increased levels of LC3II mRNA and protein. The autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA) effectively reduced LC3II levels and autophagosome formation in hippocampal slice cultures exposed to OGD. Neuronal cell death was significantly attenuated. Finally, we found that the pharmacologic inhibition of NADPH oxidase using apocynin or gp91ds-tat decreased autophagy in hippocampal slice cultures and the rat brain respectively.

     "abstract": "Reperfusion injury, the paradoxical tissue response that is manifested by blood flow-deprived and oxygen-starved organs following the restoration of blood flow and tissue oxygenation, has been a focus of basic and clinical research for over 4-decades. While a variety of molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) continues to receive much attention as a critical factor in the genesis of reperfusion injury. As a consequence, considerable effort has been devoted to identifying the dominant cellular and enzymatic sources of excess ROS production following ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). Of the potential ROS sources described to date, xanthine oxidase, NADPH oxidase (Nox), mitochondria, and uncoupled nitric oxide synthase have gained a status as the most likely contributors to reperfusion-induced oxidative stress and represent priority targets for therapeutic intervention against reperfusion-induced organ dysfunction and tissue damage. Although all four enzymatic sources are present in most tissues and are likely to play some role in reperfusion injury, priority and emphasis has been given to specific ROS sources that are enriched in certain tissues, such as xanthine oxidase in the gastrointestinal tract and mitochondria in the metabolically active heart and brain. The possibility that multiple ROS sources contribute to reperfusion injury in most tissues is supported by evidence demonstrating that redox-signaling enables ROS produced by one enzymatic source (e.g., Nox) to activate and enhance ROS production by a second source (e.g., mitochondria). This review provides a synopsis of the evidence implicating ROS in reperfusion injury, the clinical implications of this phenomenon, and summarizes current understanding of the four most frequently invoked enzymatic sources of ROS production in post-ischemic tissue.",

     "abstract": "The mechanism by which c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) promotes tissue injury is poorly understood. Thus we aimed at studying the roles of JNK and its phospho-target proteins in mouse models of acute liver injury. Young male mice were exposed to a single dose of CCl4 (50\u00a0mg/kg, IP) and euthanized at different time points. Liver histology, blood alanine aminotransferase, and other enzyme activities were measured in CCl4-exposed mice without or with the highly-specific JNK inhibitors. Phosphoproteins were purified from control or CCl4-exposed mice and analyzed by differential mass-spectrometry followed by further characterizations of immunoprecipitation and activity measurements. JNK was activated within 1\u00a0h while liver damage was maximal at 24\u00a0h post-CCl4 injection. Markedly increased phosphorylation of many mitochondrial proteins was observed between 1 and 8\u00a0h following CCl4 exposure. Pretreatment with the selective JNK inhibitor SU3327 or the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant mito-TEMPO markedly reduced the levels of p-JNK, mitochondrial phosphoproteins and liver damage in CCl4-exposed mice. Differential proteomic analysis identified many phosphorylated mitochondrial proteins involved in anti-oxidant defense, electron transfer, energy supply, fatty acid oxidation, etc. Aldehyde dehydrogenase, NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase were phosphorylated in CCl4-exposed mice but dephosphorylated after SU3327 pretreatment. Consistently, the suppressed activities of these enzymes were restored by SU3327 pretreatment in CCl4-exposed mice. These data provide a novel mechanism by which JNK, rapidly activated by CCl4, promotes mitochondrial dysfunction and acute hepatotoxicity through robust phosphorylation of numerous mitochondrial proteins.",

To find a clue for early detection and prevention of ovarian endometriosis-associated cancer, it is mandatory to evaluate catalytic (labile) ferrous iron (catalytic Fe(II)) and to study iron manipulation in ovarian endometriotic lesions. By the use of tissues from women of ovarian endometriosis as well as endometrial tissue from women with and without endometriosis, we for the first time performed histological analysis and cellular detection of catalytic Fe(II) with a specific fluorescent probe (HMRhoNox-M), and further evaluated iron transport proteins in the human specimens and in co-culture experiments using immortalized human eutopic/ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) in the presence or absence of epithelial cells (EpCs). The amounts of catalytic Fe(II) were higher in ectopic endometrial stromal cells (ecESCs) than in normal eutopic endometrial stromal cells (n-euESCs) both in the tissues and in the corresponding immortalized ESCs. ecESCs exhibited higher transferrin receptor 1 expression both in vivo and in vitro and lower ferroportin expression in vivo than n-euESCs, leading to sustained iron uptake. In co-culture experiments of ESCs with iron-loaded EpCs, ecESCs received catalytic ferrous iron from EpCs, but n-euESCs did not. These data suggest that ecESC play a protective role for cancer-target epithelial cells by collecting excess iron, and that these characteristics are retained in the immortalized ecESCs.",

     "abstract": "Recent advances indicate a possible role of phytochemicals as modulatory factors in signaling pathways. We have previously demonstrated PHLPP2-mediated suppression of Nrf2 responses during oxidant attack. The present study was designed to explore Nrf2-potentiating mechanism of morin, a flavonol, via its possible role in intervening PHLPP2-regulated Akt/GSK3\u03b2/Fyn kinase axis. Efficacy of morin was evaluated against oxidative stress-mediated damage to primary hepatocytes by tert-butyl hydroperoxide (tBHP) and acetaminophen. The anti-cytotoxic effects of morin were found to be a consequence of fortification of Nrf2-regulated antioxidant defenses since morin failed to sustain activities of redox enzyme in Nrf2 silenced hepatocytes. Morin promoted Nrf2 stability and its nuclear retention by possibly modulating PHLPP2 activity which subdues cellular Nrf2 responses by activating Fyn kinase. Pull-down assay using morin-conjugated beads indicated the binding affinity of morin towards PHLPP2. Molecular docking also revealed the propensity of morin to occupy the active site of PHLPP2 enzyme. Thus, dietary phytochemical morin was observed to counteract oxidant-induced hepatocellular damage by promoting Nrf2-regulated transcriptional induction. The findings support the novel role of morin in potentiating Nrf2 responses by limiting PHLPP2 and hence Fyn kinase activation. Therefore, morin may be exploited in developing novel therapeutic strategy aimed at enhancing Nrf2 responses.",

Planarian genomic databases have led to the identification of genes that are required for regeneration, with implications for their roles in its underlying mechanism. Coenzyme Q (CoQ) is a fundamental lipophilic molecule that is synthesized and expressed in every cell of every organism. Furthermore, CoQ levels affect development, life span, disease and aging in nematodes and mice. Because CoQ can be ingested in food, it has been used in preventive nutrition. In this study, we investigated the role of CoQ in planarian regeneration. Planarians synthesize both CoQ9 and rhodoquinone 9 (RQ9). Knockdown of Smed-dlp1, a trans-prenyltransferase gene that encodes an enzyme that synthesizes the CoQ side chain, led to a decrease in CoQ9 and RQ9 levels. However, ATP levels did not consistently decrease in these animals. Knockdown animals exhibited tissue regression and curling. The number of mitotic cells decreased in Smed-dlp1 (RNAi) animals. These results suggested a failure in physiological cell turnover and stem cell function. Accordingly, regenerating planarians died from lysis or exhibited delayed regeneration. Interestingly, the observed phenotypes were partially rescued by ingesting food supplemented with \u03b1-tocopherol. Taken together, our results suggest that oxidative stress induced by reduced CoQ9 levels affects planarian regeneration and tissue homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "Inhibitor studies with isolated mitochondria demonstrated that complex I (CI) and III (CIII) of the electron transport chain (ETC) can act as relevant sources of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here we studied ROS generation and oxidative stress induction during chronic (24\u00a0h) inhibition of CI and CIII using rotenone (ROT) and antimycin A (AA), respectively, in intact HEK293 cells. Both inhibitors stimulated oxidation of the ROS sensor hydroethidine (HEt) and increased mitochondrial NAD(P)H levels without major effects on cell viability. Integrated analysis of cells stably expressing cytosolic- or mitochondria-targeted variants of the reporter molecules HyPer (H2O2-sensitive and pH-sensitive) and SypHer (H2O2-insensitive and pH-sensitive), revealed that CI- and CIII inhibition increased cytosolic but not mitochondrial H2O2 levels. Total and mitochondria-specific lipid peroxidation was not increased in the inhibited cells as reported by the C11-BODIPY581/591 and MitoPerOx biosensors. Also expression of the superoxide-detoxifying enzymes CuZnSOD (cytosolic) and MnSOD (mitochondrial) was not affected. Oxyblot analysis revealed that protein carbonylation was not stimulated by CI and CIII inhibition. Our findings suggest that chronic inhibition of CI and CIII: (i) increases the levels of HEt-oxidizing ROS and (ii) specifically elevates cytosolic but not mitochondrial H2O2 levels, (iii) does not induce oxidative stress or substantial cell death. We conclude that the increased ROS levels are below the stress-inducing level and might play a role in redox signaling.",

Upon ligation of platelet receptors through subendothelial matrix proteins, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated, further amplifying the platelet activation response. Thrombin, a potent platelet activator, can signal through GPIb\u03b1 and protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 and PAR4 on human platelets, and recently has been implicated in the generation of ROS. While ROS are known to have key roles in intra-platelet signalling and subsequent platelet activation, the precise receptors and signalling pathways involved in thrombin-induced ROS generation have yet to be fully elucidated.To investigate the relative contribution of platelet GPIb\u03b1 and PARs to thrombin-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.Highly specific antagonists targeting PAR1 and PAR4, and the GPIb\u03b1-cleaving enzyme, Naja kaouthia (Nk) protease, were used in quantitative flow cytometry assays of thrombin-induced ROS production. Antagonists of PAR4 but not PAR1, inhibited thrombin-derived ROS generation. Removal of the GPIb\u03b1 ligand binding region attenuated PAR4-induced and completely inhibited thrombin-induced ROS formation. Similarly, PAR4 deficiency in mice abolished thrombin-induced ROS generation. Additionally, GPIb\u03b1 and PAR4-dependent ROS formation were shown to be mediated through focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1) proteins.Both GPIb\u03b1 and PAR4 are required for thrombin-induced ROS formation, suggesting a novel functional cooperation between GPIb\u03b1 and PAR4.

As the dose was increased, acute developmental abnormalities, including cerebral hemorrhaging and jaw malformation, were observed. To determine whether transient disruption of redox homeostasis during development could have long-term consequences, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a low dose of auranofin from 6\u201324\u00a0hours post fertilization, and then raised to adulthood. The adult fish were outwardly normal in their appearance with no gross physical differences compared to the control group.

Due to their remarkable stability we have predominantly explored Mn porphyrins, aiming initially at mimicking kinetics and thermodynamics of the catalysis of O2\u2212 dismutation by SOD enzymes. Several MnPs are of potency similar to SOD enzymes. The in vivo bioavailability and toxicity of MnPs have been addressed also. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies indicate their impressive therapeutic efficacy. Increasing insight into complex cellular redox biology has been accompanied by increasing awareness of complex redox chemistry of MnPs. During O2\u2212 dismutation process, the most powerful Mn porphyrin-based SOD mimics reduce and oxidize O2\u2212 with close to identical rate constants. MnPs reduce and oxidize other reactive species also (none of them specific to MnPs), acting as reductants (antioxidant) and pro-oxidants. Distinction must be made between the type of reactions of MnPs and the favorable therapeutic effects we observe; the latter may be of either anti- or pro-oxidative nature. H2O2/MnP mediated oxidation of protein thiols and its impact on cellular transcription seems to dominate redox biology of MnPs. It has been thus far demonstrated that the ability of MnPs to catalyze O2\u2212 dismutation parallels all other reactivities (such as ONOO\u2212 reduction) and in turn their therapeutic efficacies. Assuming that all diseases have in common the perturbation of cellular redox environment, developing SOD mimics still seems to be the appropriate strategy for the design of potent redox-active therapeutics.",

The network structure decreases flexibility from conception onward due to differentiation and cumulative responses to environment (exposome). The redox theory of aging is that aging is a decline in plasticity of genome\u2013exposome interaction that occurs as a consequence of execution of differentiation and exposure memory systems. This includes compromised mitochondrial and bioenergetic flexibility, impaired food utilization and metabolic homeostasis, decreased barrier and defense capabilities and loss of reproductive fidelity and fecundity. This theory accounts for hallmarks of aging, including failure to maintain oxidative or xenobiotic defenses, mitochondrial integrity, proteostasis, barrier structures, DNA repair, telomeres, immune function, metabolic regulation and regenerative capacity.",

     "abstract": "Enzymatic and non-enzymatic lipid metabolism can give rise to reactive species that may covalently modify cellular or plasma proteins through a process known as lipoxidation. Under basal conditions, protein lipoxidation can contribute to normal cell homeostasis and participate in signaling or adaptive mechanisms, as exemplified by lipoxidation of Ras proteins or of the cytoskeletal protein vimentin, both of which behave as sensors of electrophilic species. Nevertheless, increased lipoxidation under pathological conditions may lead to deleterious effects on protein structure or aggregation. This can result in impaired degradation and accumulation of abnormally folded proteins contributing to pathophysiology, as may occur in neurodegenerative diseases. Identification of the protein targets of lipoxidation and its functional consequences under pathophysiological situations can unveil the modification patterns associated with the various outcomes, as well as preventive strategies or potential therapeutic targets. Given the wide structural variability of lipid moieties involved in lipoxidation, highly sensitive and specific methods for its detection are required. Derivatization of reactive carbonyl species is instrumental in the detection of adducts retaining carbonyl groups. In addition, use of tagged derivatives of electrophilic lipids enables enrichment of lipoxidized proteins or peptides. Ultimate confirmation of lipoxidation requires high resolution mass spectrometry approaches to unequivocally identify the adduct and the targeted residue. Moreover, rigorous validation of the targets identified and assessment of the functional consequences of these modifications are essential. Here we present an update on methods to approach the complex field of lipoxidation along with validation strategies and functional assays illustrated with well-studied lipoxidation targets.",

When SW 620 and HCT 116 human colon cancer cells were treated with 5\u00a0\u00b5M 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, cell viability, growth, and clonogenic survival were significantly decreased. Consistent with TAK1 inhibition being causally related to thiol-mediated oxidative stress, 10\u00a0mM N-acetylcysteine (NAC) partially reversed the growth inhibitory effects of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol. In addition, 5Z-7-oxozeaenol also increased steady-state levels of H2DCFDA oxidation as well as increased levels of total glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide (GSSG). Interestingly, depletion of GSH using buthionine sulfoximine did not significantly potentiate 5Z-7-oxozeaenol toxicity in either cell line. In contrast, pre-treatment of cells with auranofin (Au) to inhibit thioredoxin reductase activity significantly increased levels of oxidized thioredoxin as well as sensitized cells to 5Z-7-oxozeaenol-induced growth inhibition and clonogenic cell killing. These results were confirmed in SW 620 murine xenografts, where treatment with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol or with Au plus 5Z-7-oxozeaenol significantly inhibited growth, with Au plus 5Z-7-oxozeaenol trending toward greater growth inhibition compared to 5Z-7-oxozeaenol alone. These results support the hypothesis that thiol-mediated oxidative stress is causally related to TAK1-induced colon cancer cell killing. In addition, these results support the hypothesis that thioredoxin metabolism is a critical target for enhancing colon cancer cell killing via TAK1 inhibition and could represent an effective therapeutic strategy in patients with these highly resistant tumors.",

Nox-derived ROS are essential modulators of signal transduction pathways that control key physiological activities such as cell growth, proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis, immune responses, and biochemical pathways. Enhanced formation of Nox-derived ROS, which is generally associated with the up-regulation of different Nox subtypes, has been established in various pathologies, namely cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, cancer, and neurodegeneration. The detrimental effects of Nox-derived ROS are related to alterations in cell signalling and/or direct irreversible oxidative damage of nucleic acids, proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. Thus, understanding of transcriptional regulation mechanisms of Nox enzymes have been extensively investigated in an attempt to find ways to counteract the excessive formation of Nox-derived ROS in various pathological states. Despite the numerous existing data, the molecular pathways responsible for Nox up-regulation are not completely understood. This review article summarizes some of the recent advances and concepts related to the regulation of Nox expression in the vascular pathophysiology. It highlights the role of transcription factors and epigenetic mechanisms in this process. Identification of the signalling molecules involved in Nox up-regulation, which is associated with the onset and development of cardiovascular dysfunction may contribute to the development of novel strategies for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.",

A sophisticated network of intrinsic and extrinsic cues, integrated in the tumor niche, drives tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Critical mutations and distorted redox signaling pathways orchestrate pathologic events inside cancer cells, resulting in resistance to stress and death signals, aberrant proliferation and efficient repair mechanisms. Additionally, the complex inter-cellular crosstalk within the tumor niche, mediated by cytokines, redox-sensitive danger signals (HMGB1) and exosomes, under the pressure of multiple stresses (oxidative, inflammatory, metabolic), greatly contributes to the malignant phenotype. The tumor-associated inflammatory stress and its suppressive action on the anti-tumor immune response are highlighted. We further emphasize that ROS may act either as supporter or enemy of cancer cells, depending on the context. Oxidative stress-based therapies, such as radiotherapy and photodynamic therapy, take advantage of the cytotoxic face of ROS for killing tumor cells by a non-physiologically sudden, localized and intense oxidative burst. The type of tumor cell death elicited by these therapies is discussed. Therapy outcome depends on the differential sensitivity to oxidative stress of particular tumor cells, such as cancer stem cells, and therefore co-therapies that transiently down-regulate their intrinsic antioxidant system hold great promise. We draw attention on the consequences of the damage signals delivered by oxidative stress-injured cells to neighboring and distant cells, and emphasize the benefits of therapeutically triggered immunologic cell death in metastatic cancer. An integrative approach should be applied when designing therapeutic strategies in cancer, taking into consideration the mutational, metabolic, inflammatory and oxidative status of tumor cells, cellular heterogeneity and the hypoxia map in the tumor niche, along with the adjoining and systemic effects of oxidative stress-based therapies.",

Increasing average maternal and paternal age in developed countries over the past 40\u00a0years has raised the question of how aging affects reproductive success of males and females. Since oxidative stress in the male reproductive tract increases with age, we investigated the impact of advanced paternal age on the integrity of sperm nucleus and reproductive success of males by using a Prdx6\u2212/\u2212 mouse model. We compared sperm motility, cytoplasmic droplet retention sperm chromatin quality and reproductive outcomes of young (2-month-old), adult (8-month-old), and old (20-month-old) Prdx6\u2212/\u2212 males with their age-matched wild type (WT) controls. Absence of PRDX6 caused age-dependent impairment of sperm motility and sperm maturation and increased sperm DNA fragmentation and oxidation as well as decreased sperm DNA compaction and protamination. Litter size, total number of litters and total number of pups per male were significantly lower in Prdx6\u2212/\u2212 males compared to WT controls. These abnormal reproductive outcomes were severely affected by age in Prdx6\u2212/\u2212 males.

     "abstract": "Exposure to the space radiation environment poses risks for a range of deleterious health effects due to the unique types of radiation encountered. Galactic cosmic rays are comprised of a spectrum of highly energetic nuclei that deposit densely ionizing tracks of damage along the particle trajectory. These tracks are distinct from those generated by the more sparsely ionizing terrestrial radiations, and define the geometric distribution of the complex cellular damage that results when charged particles traverse the tissues of the body. The exquisite radiosensitivity of multipotent neural stem and progenitor cells found within the neurogenic regions of the brain predispose the central nervous system to elevated risks for radiation induced sequelae. Here we show that human neural stem cells (hNSC) exposed to different charged particles at space relevant fluences exhibit significant and persistent oxidative stress. Radiation induced oxidative stress was found to be most dependent on total dose rather than on the linear energy transfer of the incident particle. The use of redox sensitive fluorogenic dyes possessing relative specificity for hydroxyl radicals, peroxynitrite, nitric oxide (NO) and mitochondrial superoxide confirmed that most irradiation paradigms elevated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS, respectively) in hNSC over a 1 week interval following exposure. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) was not the major source of elevated nitric oxides, as the use of NOS inhibitors had little effect on NO dependent fluorescence. Our data provide extensive evidence for the capability of low doses of charged particles to elicit marked changes in the metabolic profile of irradiated hNSC. Radiation induced changes in redox state may render the brain more susceptible to the development of neurocognitive deficits that could affect an astronaut\u2019s ability to perform complex tasks during extended missions in deep space.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells adapt to high levels of oxidative stress in order to survive and proliferate by activating key transcription factors. One such master regulator, the redox sensitive transcription factor NF E2 Related Factor 2 (NRF2), controls the expression of cellular defense genes including those encoding intracellular redox-balancing proteins involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Under basal conditions, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) targets NRF2 for ubiquitination. In response to oxidative stress, NRF2 dissociates from KEAP1, entering the nucleus and binding to the antioxidant response element (ARE) in the promoter of its target genes. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production may deplete GSH levels within cancer cells. System xc\u2212, an antiporter that exports glutamate while importing cystine to be converted into cysteine for GSH synthesis, is upregulated in cancer cells in response to oxidative stress. Here, we provided evidence that the expression of xCT, the light chain subunit of system xc\u2212, is regulated by NRF2 in representative human breast cancer cells. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment increased nuclear translocation of NRF2, also increasing levels of xCT mRNA and protein and extracellular glutamate release. Overexpression of NRF2 up-regulated the activity of the xCT promoter, which contains a proximal ARE. In contrast, overexpression of KEAP1 repressed promoter activity and decreased xCT protein levels, while siRNA knockdown of KEAP1 up-regulated xCT protein levels and transporter activity. These results demonstrate the importance of the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway in balancing oxidative stress in breast cancer cells through system xc\u2212. We have previously shown that xCT is upregulated in various cancer cell lines under oxidative stress. In the current investigation, we focused on MCF-7 cells as a model for mechanistic studies.",

Clinical manifestation of the disease can lead to heart conditions, neurological disorders, and inflammatory disorders. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many human diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of oxidative stress and intracellular communication in Lyme borreliosis patients. Mitochondrial superoxide and cytosolic ionized calcium was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of Lyme borreliosis patients and healthy controls. Mitochondrial superoxide levels were significantly higher (p<0.0001) in Lyme borreliosis patients (n=32) as compared to healthy controls (n=30). Significantly low (p<0.0001) levels of cytosolic ionized calcium were also observed in Lyme borreliosis patients (n=11) when compared to healthy controls (n=11). These results indicate that there is an imbalance of reactive oxygen species and cytosolic calcium in Lyme borreliosis patients. The results further suggest that oxidative stress and interrupted intracellular communication may ultimately contribute to a condition of mitochondrial dysfunction in the immune cells of Lyme borreliosis patients.",

     "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that in normal glucose (5\u00a0mM), methylglyoxal (MG, a model of carbonyl stress) induced brain microvascular endothelial cell (IHEC) dysfunction that was associated with occludin glycation and prevented by N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Herein, we investigated the impact of high glucose and low GSH, conditions that mimicked the diabetic state, on MG-induced IHEC dysfunction. MG-induced loss of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) was potentiated in IHECs cultured for 7 or 12\u00a0days in 25\u00a0mM glucose (hyperglycemia); moreover, barrier function remained disrupted 6\u00a0h after cell transfer to normal glucose media (acute glycemic fluctuation). Notably, basal occludin glycation was elevated under these glycemic states. TEER loss was exaggerated by inhibition of glutathione (GSH) synthesis and abrogated by NAC, which corresponded to GSH decreases and increases, respectively. Significantly, glyoxalase II activity was attenuated in hyperglycemic cells. Moreover, hyperglycemia and GSH inhibition increased MG accumulation, consistent with a compromised capacity for MG elimination. \u03b1-Oxoaldehydes (MG plus glyoxal) levels were elevated in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat plasma. Immunohistochemistry revealed a prevalence of MG-positive, but fewer occludin-positive microvessels in the diabetic brain in vivo, and Western analysis confirmed an increase in MG\u2013occludin adducts. These results provide the first evidence that hyperglycemia and acute glucose fluctuation promote MG\u2013occludin formation and exacerbate brain microvascular endothelial dysfunction. Low occludin expression and high glycated-occludin contents in diabetic brain in vivo are factors that would contribute to the dysfunction of the cerebral microvasculature during diabetes.",

     "abstract": "Excessive ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure of the skin is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. Although both exogenous sunscreens and endogenous tissue components (including melanins and tryptophan-derived compounds) reduce UVR penetration, the role of endogenous proteins in absorbing environmental UV wavelengths is poorly defined. Having previously demonstrated that proteins which are rich in UVR-absorbing amino acid residues are readily degraded by broadband UVB-radiation (containing UVA, UVB and UVC wavelengths) here we hypothesised that UV chromophore (Cys, Trp and Tyr) content can predict the susceptibility of structural proteins in skin and the eye to damage by physiologically relevant doses (up to 15.4\u00a0J/cm2) of solar UVR (95% UVA, 5% UVB). We show that: i) purified suspensions of UV-chromophore-rich fibronectin dimers, fibrillin microfibrils and \u03b2- and \u03b3-lens crystallins undergo solar simulated radiation (SSR)-induced aggregation and/or decomposition and ii) exposure to identical doses of SSR has minimal effect on the size or ultrastructure of UV chromophore-poor tropoelastin, collagen I, collagen VI microfibrils and \u03b1-crystallin. If UV chromophore content is a factor in determining protein stability in vivo, we would expect that the tissue distribution of Cys, Trp and Tyr-rich proteins would correlate with regional UVR exposure. From bioinformatic analysis of 244 key structural proteins we identified several biochemically distinct, yet UV chromophore-rich, protein families. The majority of these putative UV-absorbing proteins (including the late cornified envelope proteins, keratin associated proteins, elastic fibre-associated components and \u03b2- and \u03b3-crystallins) are localised and/or particularly abundant in tissues that are exposed to the highest doses of environmental UVR, specifically the stratum corneum, hair, papillary dermis and lens. We therefore propose that UV chromophore-rich proteins are localised in regions of high UVR exposure as a consequence of an evolutionary pressure to express sacrificial protein sunscreens which reduce UVR penetration and hence mitigate tissue damage.",

A clustering of pregnancies coursing with higher and lower PI values was shown, which correlated strongly with placental bed NOX activity, but less consistently with placental tissue.The study provides evidence favoring that placental bed NOX activity parallels UtA PI enhancement and suggests that an excess in oxidation underlies the development of pregnancy disorders coursing with enhanced UtA impedance.",

We have further shown that loss of CuZnSOD targeted to skeletal muscle alone results in only mild weakness and no muscle atrophy. In this study, we targeted deletion of CuZnSOD specifically to neurons (nSod1KO mice) and determined the effect on muscle mass and weakness. The nSod1KO mice show a significant loss of CuZnSOD activity and protein level in brain and spinal cord but not in muscle tissue. The masses of the gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were not reduced in nSod1KO compared to wild type mice, even at 20\u00a0months of age, although the quadriceps and soleus muscles showed small but statistically significant reductions in mass in the nSod1KO mice. Maximum isometric specific force was reduced by 8\u201310% in the gastrocnemius and EDL muscle of nSod1KO mice, while soleus was not affected. Muscle mitochondrial ROS generation and oxidative stress measured by levels of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (RONS) regulatory enzymes, protein nitration and F2-isoprostane levels were not increased in muscle from the nSod1KO mice. Although we did not find evidence of denervation in the nSod1KO mice, neuromuscular junction morphology was altered and the expression of genes associated with denervation acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha (AChR\u03b1), the transcription factor, Runx1 and GADD45\u03b1) was increased, supporting a role for neuronal loss of CuZnSOD initiating alterations at the neuromuscular junction. These results and our previous studies support the concept that CuZnSOD deficits in either the motor neuron or muscle alone are not sufficient to initiate a full sarcopenic phenotype and that deficits in both tissues are required to recapitulate the loss of muscle observed in Sod1KO mice.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the in-vitro pro-oxidative activity of apigenin, a plant based flavone against colorectal cancer cell lines and investigate cumulative effect on long term exposure. In the present study, treatment of colorectal cell lines HT-29 and HCT-15 with apigenin resulted in anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects characterized by biochemical and morphological changes, including loss of mitochondrial membrane potential which aided in reversing the impaired apoptotic machinery leading to negative implications in cancer pathogenesis. Apigenin induces rapid free radical species production and the level of oxidative damage was assessed by qualitative and quantitative estimation of biochemical markers of oxidative stress. Increased level of mitochondrial superoxide suggested dose dependent mitochondrial oxidative damage which was generated by disruption in anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic protein balance. Continuous and persistent oxidative stress induced by apigenin at growth suppressive doses over extended treatment time period was observed to induce senescence which is a natural cellular mechanism to attenuate tumor formation. Senescence phenotype inducted by apigenin was attributed to changes in key molecules involved in p16-Rb and p53 independent p21 signaling pathways. Phosphorylation of retinoblastoma was inhibited and significant up-regulation of p21 led to simultaneous suppression of cyclins D1 and E which indicated the onset of senescence. Pro-oxidative stress induced premature senescence mediated by apigenin makes this treatment regimen a potential chemopreventive strategy and an in vitro model for aging research.",

Here we assessed whether the mitochondria targeted antioxidant MitoQ could decrease oxidative damage during IR injury and thereby protect kidney function. To do this we exposed kidneys in mice to in vivo ischemia by bilaterally occluding the renal vessels followed by reperfusion for up to 24\u00a0h. This caused renal dysfunction, measured by decreased creatinine clearance, and increased markers of oxidative damage. Administering MitoQ to the mice intravenously 15\u00a0min prior to ischemia protected the kidney from damage and dysfunction. These data indicate that mitochondrial oxidative damage contributes to kidney IR injury and that mitochondria targeted antioxidants such as MitoQ are potential therapies for renal dysfunction due to IR injury.",

Here, we examine metabolic alterations in oligodendrocytes treated with dimethyl fumarate by using a global metabolomic platform that employs both hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry and shotgun lipidomics. Prolonged treatment of oligodendrocytes with dimethyl fumarate induces changes in citric acid cycle intermediates, glutathione, and lipids, indicating that this compound can directly impact oligodendrocyte metabolism. These metabolic alterations are also associated with protection from oxidant challenge.

Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase is activated by nuclear DNA double strand breaks and delays hyperoxia-induced cell death through downstream targets p53 and p21. Evidence for its role in regulating mitochondrial function is emerging, yet it has not been determined if mitochondrial dysfunction or ROS activates ATM. Because ATM maintains mitochondrial homeostasis, we hypothesized that hyperoxia induces both mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS that activate ATM. In A549 lung epithelial cells, hyperoxia decreased mitochondrial respiratory reserve capacity at 12\u00a0h and basal respiration by 48\u00a0h. ROS were significantly increased at 24\u00a0h, yet mitochondrial DNA double strand breaks were not detected. ATM was not required for activating p53 when mitochondrial respiration was inhibited by chronic exposure to antimycin A. Also, ATM was not further activated by mitochondrial ROS, which were enhanced by depleting manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2). In contrast, ATM dampened the accumulation of mitochondrial ROS during exposure to hyperoxia. Our findings suggest that hyperoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS do not activate ATM. ATM more likely carries out its canonical response to nuclear DNA damage and may function to attenuate mitochondrial ROS that contribute to oxygen toxicity.",

Here, we report coumarin-hydrazide, a fluorescent chemical probe for time- and cost-efficient labeling of cellular carbonyls followed by fluorescence microscopy to evaluate their intracellular formation both in time and space.

Both techniques stained carbonylated species accumulated in cytoplasm with strong perinuclear clustering.

In line with these findings we noted that Hexapeptide-11 conferred significant protection in fibroblasts against oxidative-stress-mediated premature cellular senescence, while at in vivo skin deformation assays in human subjects it improved skin elasticity.

[1]) based on the balance between production and the consumption of H2O2, the later of which is a function of [H2O2] and follows first order kinetics. Here we test the hypothesis that isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria, from the rat, are able to modulate [H2O2] based upon the interaction between the production of ROS, as superoxide/H2O2, and the H2O2 decomposition capacity. The compartmentalization of detection systems for H2O2 and the intramitochondrial metabolism of H2O2 leads to spacial separation between these two components of the assay system. This results in an underestimation of rates when relying solely on extramitochondrial H2O2 detection. We find that differentiating between these apparent rates found when using extramitochondrial H2O2 detection and the actual rates of metabolism is important to determining the rate constant for H2O2 consumption by mitochondria in kinetic experiments. Using the high rate of ROS production by mitochondria respiring on succinate, we demonstrate that net H2O2 metabolism by mitochondria can approach a stable steady-state of extramitochondrial [H2O2]. Importantly, the rate constant determined by extrapolation of kinetic experiments is similar to the rate constant determined as the [H2O2] approaches a steady state.",

     "abstract": "Despite recent advances, the role of ROS in mediating hypertrophic and apoptotic responses in cardiac myocytes elicited by norepinephrine (NE) is rather poorly understood. We demonstrate through our experiments that H9c2 cardiac myoblasts treated with 2\u00a0\u00b5M NE (hypertrophic dose) generate DCFH-DA positive ROS only for 2\u00a0h; while those treated with 100\u00a0\u00b5M NE (apoptotic dose) sustains generation for 48\u00a0h, followed by apoptosis. Though the levels of DCFH fluorescence were comparable at early time points in the two treatment sets, its quenching by DPI, catalase and MnTmPyP suggested the existence of a different repertoire of ROS. Both doses of NE also induced moderate levels of H2O2 but with different kinetics. Sustained but intermittent generation of highly reactive species detectable by HPF was seen in both treatment sets but no peroxynitrite was generated in either conditions. Sustained generation of hydroxyl radicals with no appreciable differences were noticed in both treatment sets. Nevertheless, despite similar profile of ROS generation between the two conditions, extensive DNA damage as evident from the increase in 8-OH-dG content, formation of \u03b3-H2AX and PARP cleavage was seen only in cells treated with the higher dose of NE. We therefore conclude that hypertrophic and apoptotic doses of NE generate distinct but comparable repertoire of ROS/RNS leading to two very distinct downstream responses.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia corresponds to the degenerative loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and strength associated with ageing and leads to a progressive impairment of mobility and quality of life. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in this process are not completely understood. A hallmark of cellular and tissular ageing is the accumulation of oxidatively modified (carbonylated) proteins, leading to a decreased quality of the cellular proteome that could directly impact on normal cellular functions. Although increased oxidative stress has been reported during skeletal muscle ageing, the oxidized protein targets, also referred as to the \u2018oxi-proteome\u2019 or \u2018carbonylome\u2019, have not been characterized yet. To better understand the mechanisms by which these damaged proteins build up and potentially affect muscle function, proteins targeted by these modifications have been identified in human rectus abdominis muscle obtained from young and old healthy donors using a bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomic approach coupled with immunodetection of carbonylated proteins. Among evidenced protein spots, 17 were found as increased carbonylated in biopsies from old donors comparing to young counterparts. These proteins are involved in key cellular functions such as cellular morphology and transport, muscle contraction and energy metabolism. Importantly, impairment of these pathways has been described in skeletal muscle during ageing. Functional decline of these proteins due to irreversible oxidation may therefore impact directly on the above-mentioned pathways, hence contributing to the generation of the sarcopenic phenotype.",

Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the function of regulatory systems of internal organs and may sensitively indicate early metabolic disturbances. We hypothesize that quantitative and qualitative changes of HRV in young subjects may reflect early metabolic derangements responsible for further development of clinically significant disease.The aim of our study was to determine whether the parameters of carbohydrate metabolism (fasting blood glucose, HBA1c and surrogate insulin sensitivity/resistance indices) correlate with anthropometric data and HRV.The study group consisted of 30 healthy sedentary male subjects aged 20\u201340, nonsmokers, mainly office and research employees, medical staff and students. Athletes, actively training more than one hour per week, severely obese and men of physical work were excluded from the study. HRV parameters were derived from short term ECG records (five minutes intervals) in supine position and during orthostatic test. Anthropometric data included height, weight, body mass index (BMI), age and body composition (estimation by bioelectric impedance method). The fasting blood glucose, insulin and C-peptide, homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR) index and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were evaluated. Linear correlation coefficient (r) was calculated using Statistica 10.0 software.HOMA-IR index correlated positively with body weight, visceral fat and BMI (p=0.047, 0.027 and 0.017 respectively). In supine position pNN50 positively correlated with glucose/insulin ratio (p=0.011) and heart rate with HOMA-IR (p=0.006). In orthostatic test negative correlations of HBA1c with standard deviation, total and low frequency power were determined (p=0.034, 0.400 and 0.403 respectively), which indicates a gradual worsening of functional capacity of cardiovascular system with low-grade increase (under the conventional threshold) of HBA1c.In apparently healthy sedentary subjects HRV reduction correlates with the age advancement, subclinical deteriorations of carbohydrate metabolism and excessive fat accumulation.",

In the following study we compared the effects of such diets on redox regulation pathways during development of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) larvae. Cod larvae were fed a control diet of copepods or the typical rotifer/Artemia diet commonly used in commercial marine fish hatcheries, from first feeding until after metamorphosis. The oxidised and reduced glutathione levels, the redox potential, and the mRNA expression of 100 genes in redox system pathways were then compared between treatments during larval development. We found that rotifer/Artemia-fed cod larvae had lower levels of oxidised glutathione, a more reduced redox potential, and altered expression of approximately half of the redox system genes when compared to copepod-fed larvae. This rotifer/Artemia diet-induced differential regulation of the redox system was greatest during periods of suboptimal growth. Upregulation of the oxidative stress response transcription factor, nrf2, and NRF2 target genes in rotifer/Artemia fed larvae suggest this diet induced an NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response. Overall, the data demonstrate that nutritional intake plays a role in regulating the redox system in developing fish larvae. This may be a factor in dietary-induced differences observed in larval growth.",

In addition, VCM and VCD may be found as by-products of VCH oxidation in the environment. Recently, we reported the involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of VCH in Drosophila melanogaster. However, it was not possible to determine the individual contributions of VCM and VCD in VCH toxicity. Hence, we investigated the toxicity of VCM and VCD (10\u20131000\u00a0\u00b5M) in flies after 5\u00a0days of exposure via the diet. Our results indicated impairments in climbing behaviour and disruptions in antioxidant balance and redox status evidenced by an increase in DCFH oxidation, decreases in total thiol content and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in the flies exposed to VCM and VCD (p<0.05). These effects were accompanied by disruptions in the transcription of the genes encoding the proteins superoxide dismutase (SOD1), kelch-like erythroid-derived cap-n-collar (CNC) homology (ECH)-associated protein 1 (Keap-1), mitogen activated protein kinase 2 (MAPK-2), catalase, Cyp18a1, JAFRAC 1 (thioredoxin peroxidase 1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR-1) (p<0.05). VCM and VCD inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (\u03b4-ALA D) activities in the flies (p<0.05). Indeed, here, we demonstrated that different target enzymes and genes were modified by the electrophiles VCM and VCD in the flies. Thus, D. melanogaster has provided further lessons on the toxicity of VCM and VCD which suggest that the reported toxicity of VCH may be mediated by its transformation to VCM and VCD.",

     "abstract": "Hypertension is a common disease that includes oxidative stress as a major feature, and oxidative stress impairs physiological nitric oxide (NO) activity promoting cardiovascular pathophysiological mechanisms. While inorganic nitrite and nitrate are now recognized as relevant sources of NO after their bioactivation by enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways, thus lowering blood pressure, mounting evidence suggests that sodium nitrite also exerts antioxidant effects. Here we show for the first time that sodium nitrite exerts consistent systemic and vascular antioxidant and antihypertensive effects in the deoxycorticosterone-salt (DOCA-salt) hypertension model. This is particularly important because increased oxidative stress plays a major role in the DOCA-salt hypertension model, which is less dependent on activation of the renin-angiotensin system than other hypertension models. Indeed, antihypertensive effects of oral nitrite were associated with increased plasma nitrite and nitrate concentrations, and completely blunted hypertension-induced increases in plasma 8-isoprostane and lipid peroxide levels, in vascular reactive oxygen species, in vascular NADPH oxidase activity, and in vascular xanthine oxidoreductase activity. Together, these findings provide evidence that the oral administration of sodium nitrite consistently decreases the blood pressure in association with major antioxidant effects in experimental hypertension.",

Erythrocytes were incubated with 5, 45 or 100\u00a0mM glucose for up to 72\u00a0h. High glucose concentrations intensified lipid peroxidation and loss of activities of erythrocyte enzymes (glutathione S-transferase and glutathione reductase). On the other hand, hemolysis, eryptosis, calcium accumulation, loss of glutathione and increase in the GSSG/GSH ratio were attenuated by high glucose apparently due to maintenance of energy supply to the cells. Loss of plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase activity and decrease in superoxide production were not affected by glucose concentration, being seemingly determined by processes independent of both glycoxidation and energy depletion.

The results show that DEXA administration increased the basal levels of gamma-H2AX foci, keeping them higher 4\u00a0h after irradiation (IR) of the cells, compared to untreated cells. This means that DEXA might cause increased radiosensitivity in these cell lines. On the other hand, DEXA did not have an apparent effect on the formation and disappearance of the 53BP1 foci. Furthermore, it was found that DEXA administered 2\u00a0h before IR led to a radical change in DNA repair kinetics, even DEXA does not affect cell cycle. It is important to highlight that DEXA produced cell death in these cell lines compared to untreated cells. Finally and most important, the high levels of gamma-H2AX could be reversed by administration of ascorbic acid, a potent blocker of reactive oxygen species, suggesting that DEXA acts by causing DNA damage via oxidative stress.

     "abstract": "It has been previously shown that bilirubin prevents the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in response to LPS. The present study examines whether this effect is exerted through modulation of Toll-Like Receptor-4 (TLR4) signaling. LPS-stimulated iNOS and NADPH oxidase (Nox) activity in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages was assessed by measuring cellular nitrate and superoxide ( O 2 \u2212 ) production, respectively. The generation of both nitrate and O 2 \u2212 in response to LPS was suppressed by TLR4 inhibitors, indicating that activation of iNOS and Nox is TLR4-dependent. While treatment with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and bilirubin effectively abolished LPS-mediated O 2 \u2212 production, hydrogen peroxide and nitrate release were inhibited by bilirubin and PEG-catalase, but not SOD, supporting that iNOS activation is primarily dependent upon intracellular H2O2. LPS treatment increased nuclear translocation of the redox-sensitive transcription factor Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), an effect that was abolished by bilirubin. Cells transfected with murine iNOS reporter constructs in which the HIF-1\u03b1-specific hypoxia response element was disrupted exhibited a blunted response to LPS, supporting that HIF-1\u03b1 mediates Nox-dependent iNOS expression. Bilirubin, but not SOD, blocked the cellular production of interferon-\u03b2, while interleukin-6 production remained unaffected. These data support that bilirubin inhibits the TLR4-mediated up-regulation of iNOS by preventing activation of HIF-1\u03b1 through scavenging of Nox-derived reactive oxygen species. Bilirubin also suppresses interferon-\u03b2 release via a ROS-independent mechanism. These findings characterize potential mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory effects of bilirubin.",

An interesting interaction occurs between NO\u2022 and p53 tumor suppressor, in which NO\u2022-induced DNA damage causes the stabilization and accumulation of p53, which in turn, transrepresses inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) in a negative feedback loop. In chronic inflammatory diseases, for example ulcerative colitis, NO\u2022 induces p53 stabilization and the initiation of DNA-damage response pathway, and also generation of p53 mutation and subsequent clonal selection of p53 mutant cells. Genetic deletion of NOS2 in p53-deficient mice can either suppress or enhance lymphomagenesis depending on the inflammatory microenvironment.

Furthermore 46 genes, of which 23 were associated with basal like breast cancer, were elevated when iNOS high. In vitro studies using ER(-) cell lines showed that fluxes of nitric oxide (NO) delivered by NO donors surprising mimic this relationship in the patient cohort.

In addition, we show that tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 and PP2A are inhibited by these NO levels. Similarly other studies show that these concentrations of NO increase immunosuppressive proteins TGF-\u03b2 and IL-10 in leukocytes to decrease efficacy of some anticancer therapies further contributing to pro-tumorigenic environment.

     "abstract": "Regardless of etiology, inflammatory conditions are characterized by overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and overproduction of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen species (NO/RNS) in epithelial and inflammatory cells at the site of carcinogenesis.NO/RNS produced in inflamed tissues can contribute to the process of carcinogenesis by different mechanisms. One of these mechanisms is NO-dependent stimulation of genomic instability by inhibiting of Breast Cancer type 1 Susceptibility protein (BRCA1) expression. Block of BRCA1 expression shifts DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) repair from error-free high-fidelity homologous recombination repair (HRR) to error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ).BRCA1 epigenetically block miRNA-155 expression via its association with HDAC2, which deacetylates histones H2A and H3 on the miRNA-155 promoter. The miRNA-155 is responsible for post-translational silencing of essential members of mismatch repair (MMR) core: MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1 proteins. They epigenetic inactivation induces DNA microsatellite instability (MSI). Recently, we demonstrated NO-dependent downregulation of MMR core proteins (MSH2, MSH6, and MLH1) through the \u2193BRCA1/\u2191miRNA-155 signaling pathway. Hence, another NO-dependent mechanism of genomic instability is downregulation of MMR core proteins and stimulation of the DNA MSI.Loss or inhibition of Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) activity results in accumulation of DNA single-strand breaks, which are subsequently converted to DSB by the transcription machinery. In BRCA-positive cells, DSB are repaired by HRR, but they cannot be properly repaired in BRCA1-deficient cells, leading to genomic instability, chromosomal rearrangements, and cell death. Our data demonstrated that combination of NO-donors with PARP inhibitors significantly sensitized the BRCA1-positive cancer cells to DNA-damaging agents.",

Beyond oncogenic KRAS, redox-dependent reactions have been implicated in the activation of the remaining wild-type RAS proteins in pancreatic cancer cell lines. These results suggest a possible involvement of wild-type RAS proteins in pancreatic cancer.To evaluate the impact of genetically suppressing wild-type RAS expression on pancreatic cancer.Hras homozygous null mice (Hras-/-) were crossed into a Pdx-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D/+ (KC) murine background in which oncogenic Kras is activated in the pancreas to promote preinvasive pancreatic cancer. Tumor burden was then measured at different stages of disease.HRas-/-;KC mice exhibited more precancerous lesions in the pancreas and more off-target skin papillomas compared to their wild-type counterparts, suggesting that Hras suppresses early oncogenic Kras-driven tumorigenesis, possibly at the time of initiation. Loss of Hras also reduced the survival of mice engineered to develop aggressive pancreatic cancer by the additional disruption of one allele of the tumor suppressor p53 (Trp53R172H/+). However, this survival advantage was lost when both alleles of Trp53 were mutated, suggesting that wild-type Hras inhibits tumorigenesis in a p53-dependent fashion.Loss of wild-type Hras promotes the earliest stages of pancreatic tumorigenesis, and moreover results in more rapid progression of the disease. As such, mechanisms leading to activation of wild-type Ras proteins, including but not limited to redox-dependent reactions, may influence the development of pancreatic cancer.",

When bound to GTP, Ras engages and activates a number of effectors that mediate proliferative and survival signals. Ras is mutated in over 30% of human cancers, usually at codons 12, 13, or 61, to remain in this active, GTP-bound state, which promotes tumorigenesis. One of these oncogenic mutations that commonly occurs in lung cancer is G12C. Recently, it was shown that alkylating agents that react with the thiol functional group of this mutant amino acid can inactivate oncogenic RasG12C.Given that Cys12 of RasG12C is accessible to thiol alkylating agents and forms interactions within the electrostatic phosphoryl-binding loop of Ras, we postulated that Cys12 may possess an altered pKa, potentially allowing this residue to be modified by NO and other cellular oxidants.We conducted several biochemical analyses to determine whether nitrosylation of RasG12C alters its activity and structure in vitro. We also determined the biological effects of increasing NO production on the tumorigenic growth of cells transformed by RasG12C.We found that Cys12 has a depressed pKa of 7.4, which increases the susceptibility of the thiol to modification by oxidation or nitrosylation at physiological pH. We also found that coexpressing active eNOSS1177D and RasG12C accelerated tumorigenic growth of human and murine cell line xenografts.Modification of Cys12 in mutant, oncogenic RasG12C may promote its tumorigenic activity.",

     "abstract": "Tumor cells develop several mechanisms to avoid cell death by various unrelated cytotoxic agents. We have identified one such gene regulatory mechanism that inhibits, in large part, the cell death apoptotic pathways. This dysregulated mechanism is the result of several inter-related gene products that form a loop and consist of the NF-\u03baB/Snail/YY1/RKIP/PTEN. The gene product expressions in this loop regulate the resistance to both chemotherapeutic drugs and cytotoxic immune lymphocytes/ligands. Briefly, the expressions and activities of NF-\u03baB, Snail and YY1 are upregulated whereas the expressions and the activities of RKIP and PTEN are downregulated. The upregulated gene products are involved in the cell survival and growth and the expression of anti-apoptotic gene products; however, the downregulated gene products are involved in the inhibition of cell survival and anti-apoptotic gene products. The modulation of each of the gene products in the loop is sufficient to reverse resistance. We have found that treatment of tumor cells with high levels of NO donors resulted in the downregulation of the expression of NF-\u03baB, Snail and YY1 while upregulation of RKIP and PTEN. Treatment with NO inhibited NF-\u03baB, Snail and YY1 via s-nitrosylation. As repressors, their inhibition resulted in the upregulation of RKIP and PTEN. Subsequently, several anti-apoptotic gene products are inhibited by NO treatment as well as modifying the integrity of the mitochondria. Hence, treatment of resistant tumor cells with NO resulted in both the chemo and immunosensitization of tumor cells to apoptosis, in vitro and in vivo. The findings suggested the important role of NO donors as potential therapeutic sensitizing agents to reverse resistance.",

     "abstract": "One of the key features of tumour cells is the acquisition of resistance to apoptosis. Thus, determining therapeutic strategies that circumvent apoptotic resistance and result in tumor regression is a challenge. One strategy to induce apoptosis is to activate death receptor signalling pathways. Members of the Tumor Necrosis Factor TNF-family death receptors ligand (TRAIL, FasL and TNF-\u03b1) can originate from immune and non-immune cells. Death receptors, engaged by cognate ligands, can initiate multiple signaling pathways, which can generate diverse outcomes, including non-apoptosis-related signal. Knowledge on the molecular mechanisms (that determine death or survival of tumour cells) following exposure to the TNF-family death receptors ligands have demonstrated that post-translational modifications of the signaling pathway components play a critical role in determining cell fate. Cell death can be sensed by nitric oxide (NO) in a wide variety of tumour cells. S-nitrosylation, the covalent modification of a protein cysteine thiol by an NO moiety, has emerged as an important post-translational regulation for the TNF-family death receptor signaling pathways. It has been demonstrated that death receptor DR4 (TRAIL-R1) becomes S-nitrosylated and promotes apoptosis following a specific NO donor treatment (Tang et al., 2006). Then, our group has shown that S-nitrosylation of Fas, following glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) exposure, promotes redistribution of the receptor to lipid rafts, formation of the death-inducing signal complex (DISC), and induction of cell death. Finally, I will discuss our recent efforts to decipher regulatory mechanism of the TNF-\u03b1/TNFR1 signalling cell death pathway by S-nitrosylation following GTN treatment.",

The resultant extracellular superoxide anions control the proliferation of malignant cells, but they also drive two intercellular signaling pathways that cause selective apoptosis induction in malignant cells, i. e. the HOCl and the NO/peroxynitrite pathway. Tumor progression requires the establishment of resistance against these apoptosis-inducing pathways through expression of membrane-associated catalase that interferes with HOCl signaling through decomposition of H2O2 and with NO/peroxynitrite through oxidation of NO and decomposition of peroxynitrite.We aimed to establish the biochemical basis for novel therapeutic approaches that target tumor cell protective catalase and thus cause reactivation of intercellular reactive oxygen/nitrogen species-dependent apoptotic signaling of tumor cells.We used cells from defined stages of multistep oncogenesis, i. e. nontransformed, transformed and bona vide tumor cells. Intercellular apoptosis-inducing ROS/RNS signaling was studied using defined inhibitors/scavengers, reconstitution experiments and small interfering RNA directed against relevant targets.Direct inhibition of tumor cell catalase by neutralizing antibodies or its direct inactivation by extracellular singlet oxygen caused efficient reactivation of apoptosis-inducing signaling. Interestingly, the increase in cell-derived NO through addition of arginine, inhibition of arginase, inhibition of NO dioxygenase or induction of NO synthase by interferon led to the generation of extracellular singlet oxygen that triggered a complex self-amplificatory system. As a result, high concentrations of cell-derived singlet oxygen inactivated catalase and reactivated apoptosis inducing intercellular signaling.Modulation of the cellular NO concentration causes extracellular singlet oxygen generation and inactivation of tumor cell protective catalase.",

The aim of this study was to develop a method that allows stabilizing apoptotic cells for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. We were able by using a cocktail composed of taxol (a microtubule stabilizer), Zn2+ (a caspase inhibitor) and coenzyme Q10 (a lipid antioxidant) to stabilize H460 apoptotic cells in cell cultures for at least 72\u00a0hours preventing secondary necrosis. Stabilized apoptotic cells maintain many apoptotic cells characteristics such as the presence of apoptotic microtubules, plasma membrane integrity, low intracellular calcium levels, plasma membrane potential, PS externalization and ability of being phagocytosed.Stabilized apoptotic cells can be considered as dying cells in which the cellular cortex and plasma membrane are maintained intact or alive.

     "abstract": "In this study, we assessed S-nitrosylation-based regulation of Janus-activated kinase 2/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2/STAT3) pathway. Our studies show that STAT3 in stimulated microglia underwent two distinct redox-dependent modifications, S-nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation. STAT3 S-nitrosylation was associated with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-produced nitric oxide (NO) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), whereas S-glutathionylation of STAT3 was associated with cellular oxidative stress. NO produced by iNOS or treatment of microglia with exogenous GSNO inhibited STAT3 activation via inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation (Tyr705). Consequently, the interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced microglial proliferation and associated gene expressions were also reduced. In cell-free kinase assay using purified JAK2 and STAT3, STAT3 phosphorylation was inhibited by its selective preincubation with GSNO, but not by preincubation of JAK2 with GSNO, indicating that GSNO-mediated mechanisms inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation through S-nitrosylation of STAT3 rather than JAK2. In this study, we identified that Cys259 was the target Cys residue of GSNO-mediated S-nitrosylation of STAT3. The replacement of Cys259 residue with Ala abolished the inhibitory role of GSNO in IL-6-induced STAT3 phosphorylation and transactivation, suggesting the role of Cys259S-nitrosylation in STAT3phosphorylation.Since STAT3 activation is involved in tumor progression and metastasis, we investigated the effect of GSNO in cell culture and mouse xenograft model of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). GSNO treatment of HNSCCN cell lines reversibly decreases the activation (phosphorylation) of STAT3 in a concentration dependent manner. The reduced STAT3/NF-kB activity by GSNO correlated with decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptosis of HNSCC cells. In HNSCC mouse xenograft model, the tumor growth was reduced by systemic treatment with GSNO and was further reduced when the treatment combined with radiation and cisplatin. Accordingly, GSNO treatment also resulted in decreased levels of pSTAT3 and tumor growth regulators (ie. cyclin D2, VEGF and Bcl-2) in tumor tissue. In summary, these findings have implications for the development of new therapeutics targeting of STAT3 for treating diseases associated with inflammatory/immune responses and abnormal cell proliferation, including cancer.",

     "abstract": "The acquired ability of tumour cells to avoid destruction by immune effector mechanisms (immune escape) is important for malignant progression. Also associated with malignant progression is tumour hypoxia, which induces aggressive phenotypes such as invasion, metastasis and drug resistance in cancer cells. Our studies revealed that hypoxia contributes to escape from innate immunity by increasing tumour cell expression of the metalloproteinase ADAM10 in a manner dependent on accumulation of the alpha subunit of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1\u03b1). Increased ADAM10 expression leads to shedding of the NK cell-activating ligand, MICA, from the surface of tumour cells, thereby resulting in resistance to NK cell-mediated lysis. Our more recent studies demonstrated that hypoxia, also via HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation, increases the expression of the inhibitory co-stimulatory ligand PD-L1 on tumour cells. Elevated PD-L1 expression leads to escape from adaptive immunity via increased apoptosis of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Accumulating evidence indicates that hypoxia-induced acquisition of malignant phenotypes, including immune escape, is in part due to impaired nitric oxide (NO)-mediated activation of cGMP signalling and that restoration of cGMP signalling prevents such hypoxic responses. We have shown that NO/cGMP signalling inhibits hypoxia-induced malignant phenotypes likely in part by interfering with HIF-1\u03b1 accumulation via a mechanism involving calpain. These findings indicate that activation of NO/cGMP signalling may have useful applications in cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "We previously reported that oncogenic KRAS activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway stimulates the remaining wild-type HRAS and NRAS proteins in a manner dependent upon both eNOS expression and C118 in HRAS and NRAS, which promoted tumor growth. Interestingly however, we recently found that loss of wild-type HRAS, NRAS, and even more potently, loss of both of these genes actually enhanced oncogenic KRAS-driven early tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results indicate that wild-type RAS proteins are tumor suppressing early in tumorigenesis, but tumor promoting in more malignant settings. Knock-in of a C118S mutation into an endogenous wild-type RAS gene did not, however, hamper oncogenic KRAS-driven tumor initiation. As such, redox-dependent reactions with C118 of wild-type RAS proteins are unlikely to be responsible for the tumor suppressive role of wild-type RAS proteins. This suggests that the redox-dependent reactions with C118 of wild-type RAS proteins are more important in more malignant settings. Given this, it stands to reason that inhibiting redox-dependent reactions like S-nitrosylation of wild-type RAS proteins may be more effective in established cancer settings. Indeed, we find that in three different models of KRAS-driven cancers-skin, pancreatic and lung- the general NOS inhibitor l-NAME reduced tumor burden and/or extended the lifespan of mice. Since oncogenic RAS has so far proven refractory to pharmacologic inhibition, targeting NOS activity may be an actionable approach to inhibiting RAS signaling for the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers.",

The shift from a tumor-attacking to a tumor-supportive macrophage phenotype is based on an educational program that, at least in part, is initiated by apoptotic tumor cells.We explored the macrophage phenotype shift during tumor progression by analyzing the macrophage NO-output system and examining potential NO targets.Biochemical and Molecular Biology-orientated cell culture experiments, in part using 3d-tumor spheroid models as well as animal experiments were used.Apoptotic cells polarize macrophages towards a healing, tumor-supportive phenotype. Soluble mediators released from apoptotic cells, among them the lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), cause expression of arginase 2 in macrophages, thereby lowering citrulline/NO formation but enhancing ornithine production. Mechanistically, this is achieved via the S1P2 receptor and the CRE (cAMP-response element) binding site in the arginase 2 promoter. Reduced NO-formation is also seen in ex vivo macrophages from a xenograft model allowing restricted vs. unrestricted tumor growth based on tumor-associated S1P-formation. The theoretical ability of NO to target hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and jumonji histone demethylases (JHDMs) in cells of the tumor microenvironment will be discussed in light of the iNOS/arginase balance. Moreover, data on the importance of HIF-1 in macrophages for their interaction with tumor cells, polarization, and angiogenic potential will be presented.We hypothesize that apoptotic death of tumor cells and associated macrophage activation facilitates the progression of malignant disease.

Patients homozygous for longer repeats (LL) had decreased risk of highly aggressive (Gleason \u22657;PSA>20;T3+) tumours (OR:0.40;CI:0.14-1.08;p=0.071), but, once ill they showed a threefold increased risk of dying in prostate cancer (HR:3.31;CI:0.85-12.85;p=0.084), compared to SS-homozygotes. The SNP-alleles that co-varied with the (CCTTT)l-allele also had lower risk of aggressive tumours, as well as, once ill, a 2-4 times higher risk of dying (p=0.009). Also the proportion of patients with lymph node metastases increased with length of the (CCTTT)n-alleles of the patients (SS<SM<SL<MM<ML <LL)(trend analysis; p=0.033).Nitric oxide can induce proliferation as well as apoptosis depending on cellular context. Our results suggest that NOS2 polymorphisms may influence the risk of aggressive prostate cancer and that these polymorphisms could have an impact on disease pathogenesis, possibly by affecting intracellular nitric oxide levels.",

We developed NOSH-aspirin a safer, nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide releasing hybrid.Here we report on NOSH-aspirin as an anti-inflammatory and its effects on human cancer cell kinetics and various cancer xenografts.Anti-inflammatory: Carageenan rat paw edema model. Cancer cell lines: Colon, HT-29, HCT 15, SW 480; breast, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231; pancreas, MIA PaCa2, BxPC3. Normal cell lines: human mammary, HMEpC; pancreatic epithelial, ACBRI 515. Xenografts: nude mice implanted with HT-29, MDA-MB-231, MIA PaCa2 cells, were treated with NOSH-aspirin (100\u00a0mg/kg/d) or vehicle. After 3 weeks, mice were sacrificed, tumors excised, weighed, and fixed for IHC studies.NOSH-aspirin significantly reduced paw edema as function of time. NOSH-aspirin\u2019s IC50 in nM at 24\u00a0h for cell growth inhibition ranged from 50\u00b12 to 250\u00b110 in the cancer cell lines and about 400-fold higher in the normal cell lines. The cell growth inhibitory effects were due to a dose-dependent induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (G0/G1), leading to reductions in cell proliferation. In xenografts, NOSH-aspirin had no effect on the weight of the mice. Tumor volume was reduced as a function of treatment time. At sacrifice, tumor mass reductions were colon: 89%, P=0.005; breast: 91%, P=0.006; pancreas: 75%, P=0.0031. Growth inhibition was due to reduced proliferation (decreased PCNA expression), and induction of apoptosis (increased TUNEL positive cells).NOSH-aspirin is a potent anti-inflammatory, preferentially affecting cancer cells and targets parameters important in determining cellular mass.",

Therefore, the new cancer treatment strategies are being developed. Among many agents that have been studied for their potential anti-cancer activity, the most promising are the nitric oxide (NO) donors-syntethic compounds that release NO in vivo and/or in vitro.We have evaluated the effect of NO donors on the SK-OV-3 and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell lines. We assessed some of the cancer cells\u2019 specific features: the uncontrolled proliferation, over-activation of particular signaling proteins, high resistance to therapeutics and elevated expression and secretion of invasiveness/metastatic factors.Two members of NONOates family were used: SPER/NO and DETA/NO. Cancer cell lines were cultured with different concentrations of NO donors. The cytotoxic, pro-apoptotic activity of NO donors and their impact on the phosphorylation status of STAT-3 and AKT in cells were determined. The expression of VEGF-A, MMPs and TGF-\u03b2 was also evaluated.NO donors inhibited ovarian cancer cells growth making them also more susceptible to the cisplatin cytotoxic activity. Moreover, both NO donors induced apoptosis of cells and decreased activity of signaling proteins (STAT3 and AKT). Similarly, SPER/NO and DETA/NO lowered the secretion of pro-metastatic factors, responsible for cancer cells invasiveness.The obtained results show that both NO donors demonstrated a wide range of action on both ovarian cancer cell lines. Therefore, they have a high potential of being a supporting compounds in the cancer therapies.",

     "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) inhibits cell respiration reversibly and in competition with O2 through the inhibition of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV). At concentrations lower than those required to inhibit respiration, endogenous NO enhances the reduction of the electron transport chain, thus enabling cells to maintain their O2 consumption. This however facilitates the release of superoxide anion, which initiates the transcriptional activation of NF-kB as an early signal of a stress response. Through free radical formation, long-term inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by NO leads to persistent inhibition of Complex I. This is dependent on the S-nitrosylation of a specific thiol in the active form of this protein. S-nitrosylation of Complex I might indicate the early stages of a pathological process.Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by low concentrations of NO at critical O2 concentrations also leads to prevention of the stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) due to the redistribution of O2 towards non-respiratory O2-dependent targets. This prevents the cell from registering a state of hypoxia at low O2 concentrations. On the other hand, at higher concentrations such as those generated in certain forms of cancer, NO increases the expression of HIF-1\u03b1 by an action most probably involving a free radical mechanism.It is likely that the interactions between oxygen and NO, either at the mitochondria or in the cell in general, play a role in the initiation and development of neoplastic transformation and spreading. The ways in which these interactions operate remain unclear and are likely to vary from cancer to cancer.",

     "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptor (VEGFR) are overexpressed in the majority of renal cell carcinomas (RCC). This characteristic has supported the rationale of targeting VEGF-driven tumour vascularization, especially in clear cell RCC. VEGF-inhibiting strategies include the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, axitinib, pazopanib, and sorafenib) and neutralizing antibodies such as bevacizumab.Hypertension (HT) is one of the most common adverse effects of angiogenesis inhibitors. Hypertension observed in clinical trials appears to correlate with the potency of VEGF kinase inhibitor against VEGFR-2: agents with higher potency are associated with a higher incidence of hypertension. Although the exact mechanism by TKIs induce hypertension has not yet been completely clarified, two key hypotheses have been postulated. First, some studies have pointed to a VEGF inhibitors-induced decrease in nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and nitric oxide (NO) production, that can result in vasoconstriction and increased blood pressure. VEGF, mediated by PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathway, upregulates the endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme leading to up-regulation of NO production. So inhibition of signaling through the VEGF pathway would lead to a decrease in NO production, resulting in an increase in vascular resistance and blood pressure. Secondly a decrease in the number of microvascular endothelial cells and subsequent depletion of normal microvessel density (rarefaction) occurs upon VEGF signaling inhibition.",

The present study has examined the response of the PC3 human metastatic prostate cancer cell line, following repeated low-dose pheophorbide a treatments, mimicking non-optimal PDT treatment. The analysis was focused on the NF-kB/YY1/RKIP circuitry as it is (i) dysregulated in cancer cells (ii) modulated by NO and (iii) correlated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). We hypothesized that a repeated treatment of non-optimal PDT induces low levels of NO that lead to cell growth and EMT via regulation of the above circuitry. The expressions of gene products involved in the circuitry and in EMT were analyzed by western blot. The findings demonstrate the cytoprotective role of NO following non-optimal PDT treatments that was corroborated by the use of l-NAME, an inhibitor of NOS.",

Recent evidence indicates that stimuli or stressors evoked during the course of vascular disease can regulate autophagic activity, resulting in modulation of VSMC phenotype and viability. In particular, certain growth factors and cytokines, oxygen tension, and pharmacological drugs have been shown to trigger autophagy in smooth muscle cells. Importantly, each of these stimuli has a redox component, typically associated with changes in the abundance of reactive oxygen, nitrogen, or lipid species.

This feature makes CoQ10 the bona fide cellular electron transfer molecule within the mitochondrial respiratory chain and also makes it a potent cellular antioxidant. These activities serve as justification for its popular use as food supplement. Another quinone with similarities to the naturally occurring CoQ10 is idebenone, which shares its quinone moiety with CoQ10, but at the same time differs from CoQ10 by the presence of a much shorter, less lipophilic tail. However, despite its similarity to CoQ10, idebenone cannot be isolated from any natural sources but instead was synthesized and selected as a pharmacologically active compound in the 1980s by Takeda Pharmaceuticals purely based on its pharmacological properties. Several recent clinical trials demonstrated some therapeutic efficacy of idebenone in different indications and as a consequence, many practitioners question if the freely available CoQ10 could not be used instead.

     "abstract": "Autophagy, a cellular pathway for the degradation of damaged organelles and proteins, has gained increasing importance in human pulmonary diseases, both as a modulator of pathogenesis and as a potential therapeutic target. In this pathway, cytosolic cargos are sequestered into autophagosomes, which are delivered to the lysosomes where they are enzymatically degraded and then recycled as metabolic precursors. Autophagy exerts an important effector function in the regulation of inflammation, and immune system functions. Selective pathways for autophagic degradation of cargoes may have variable significance in disease pathogenesis. Among these, the autophagic clearance of bacteria (xenophagy) may represent a crucial host defense mechanism in the pathogenesis of sepsis and inflammatory diseases. Our recent studies indicate that the autophagic clearance of mitochondria, a potentially protective program, may aggravate the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by activating cell death programs. We report similar findings with respect to the autophagic clearance of cilia components, which can contribute to airways dysfunction in chronic lung disease. In certain diseases such as pulmonary hypertension, autophagy may confer protection by modulating proliferation and cell death. In other disorders, such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cystic fibrosis, impaired autophagy may contribute to pathogenesis.

Under conditions in which cells exhibit stress-induced imbalances of photosynthetic reactions, or light absorption exceeds the ability of the cell to use photoexcitation energy in synthesis reactions, redox imbalance can occur in photosynthetic cells. Such conditions can lead to the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) associated with alterations in tetrapyrrole homeostasis. ROS accumulation can result in cellular damage and detrimental effects on organismal fitness, or ROS molecules can serve as signals to induce a protective or damage-mitigating oxidative stress signaling response in cells. Induced oxidative stress responses include tetrapyrrole-dependent and -independent mechanisms for mitigating ROS generation and/or accumulation. Thus, tetrapyrroles can be contributors to oxidative stress, but are also essential in the oxidative stress response to protect cells by contributing to detoxification of ROS. In this review, we highlight the interconnection and interdependence of tetrapyrrole metabolism with the occurrence of oxidative stress and protective oxidative stress signaling responses in photosynthetic organisms.",

However, relatively recent meta-analyses of clinical studies show that supplementation of antioxidants does not result in the presumed health benefit, but is associated with increased mortality. The dilemma that still needs to be solved is: what are antioxidants in the end, healthy or toxic? We have evaluated this dilemma by examining the presumed health effects of two individual antioxidants with opposite images i.e. the \u201cpoisonous\u201d \u03b2-carotene and the \u201cwholesome\u201d vitamin E and focused on one aspect, namely their role in inducing BPDE-DNA adducts. It appears that both antioxidants promote DNA adduct formation indirectly by inhibition of the protective enzyme glutathione-S-transferase \u03c0 (GST \u03c0). Despite their opposite image, both antioxidants display a similar type of toxicity. It is concluded that, in the appreciation of antioxidants, first their benefits should be identified and substantiated by elucidating their molecular mechanism. Subsequently, the risks should be identified including the molecular mechanism. The optimal benefit\u2013risk ratio has to be determined for each antioxidant and each individual separately, also considering the dose.",

Different inflammasome complexes have been described to date.While all inflammasomes recognize certain pathogens, it is the distinctive feature of NLRP3 inflammasome to be activated by many and diverse stimuli making NLRP3 the most versatile, and importantly also the most clinically implicated inflammasome. However, NLRP3 activation has remained the most enigmatic. It is not plausible that the intracellular NLRP3 receptor is able to detect all of its many and diverse triggers through direct interactions; instead, it is discussed that NLRP3 is responding to certain generic cellular stress-signals induced by the multitude of molecules that trigger its activation.An ever increasing number of studies link the sensing of cellular stress signals to a direct pathophysiological role of NLRP3 activation in a wide range of autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders, and thus provide a novel mechanistic rational, on how molecules trigger and support sterile inflammatory diseases. A vast interest has created to unravel how NLRP3 becomes activated, since mechanistic insight is the prerequisite for a knowledge-based development of therapeutic intervention strategies that specifically target the NLRP3 triggered IL-1\u03b2 production. In this review, we have updated knowledge on NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and activation and on the pyrin domain in NLRP3 that could represent a drug target to treat sterile inflammatory diseases. We have reported mutations in NLRP3 that were found to be associated with certain diseases. In addition, we have reviewed the functional link between NLRP3 inflammasome, the regulator of cellular redox status Trx/TXNIP complex, endoplasmic reticulum stress and the pathogenesis of diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Finally, we have provided data on NLRP3 inflammasome, as a critical regulator involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and cardiovascular diseases.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria fulfill a number of biological functions which inherently depend on ATP and O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 production. Both ATP and O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 are generated by electron transfer reactions. ATP is the product of oxidative phosphorylation whereas O2\u2212\u2022 is generated by singlet electron reduction of di-oxygen (O2). O2\u2212\u2022 is then rapidly dismutated by superoxide dismutase (SOD) producing H2O2. O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 were once viewed as unfortunately by-products of aerobic respiration. This characterization is fitting considering over production of O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 by mitochondria is associated with range of pathological conditions and aging. However, O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 are only dangerous in large quantities. If produced in a controlled fashion and maintained at a low concentration, cells can benefit greatly from the redox properties of O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2. Indeed, low rates of O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 production are required for intrinsic mitochondrial signaling (e.g. modulation of mitochondrial processes) and communication with the rest of the cell. O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 levels are kept in check by anti-oxidant defense systems that sequester O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 with extreme efficiency. Given the importance of O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 in cellular function, it is imperative to consider how mitochondria produce O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 and how O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 genesis is regulated in conjunction with fluctuations in nutritional and redox states. Here, I discuss the fundamentals of electron transfer reactions in mitochondria and emerging knowledge on the 11 potential sources of mitochondrial O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 in tandem with their significance in contributing to overall O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 emission in health and disease. The potential for classifying these different sites in isopotential groups, which is essentially defined by the redox properties of electron donator involved in O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 production, as originally suggested by Brand and colleagues is also surveyed in detail. In addition, redox signaling mechanisms that control O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 genesis from these sites are discussed. Finally, the current methodologies utilized for measuring O2\u2212\u2022/H2O2 in isolated mitochondria, cell culture and in vivo are reviewed.",

Among the merits is the notion, elicited by the combined two terms of (i) aerobic metabolism as a steady-state redox balance and (ii) the associated potential strains in the balance as denoted by the term, stress, evoking biological stress responses. Current research on molecular redox switches governing oxidative stress responses is in full bloom. The fundamental importance of linking redox shifts to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation signaling is being more fully appreciated, thanks to major advances in methodology. Among the pitfalls is the fact that the underlying molecular details are to be worked out in each particular case, which is bvious for a global concept, but which is sometimes overlooked. This can lead to indiscriminate use of the term, oxidative stress, without clear relation to redox chemistry. The major role in antioxidant defense is fulfilled by antioxidant enzymes, not by small-molecule antioxidant compounds.

We have recently shown that palmitate-induced loss of INS-1E insulinoma cells is related to increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production as both toxic effects are prevented by palmitoleate. Here we show that palmitate-induced ROS are mostly mitochondrial: oxidation of MitoSOX, a mitochondria-targeted superoxide probe, is increased by palmitate, whilst oxidation of the equivalent non-targeted probe is unaffected. Moreover, mitochondrial respiratory inhibition with antimycin A stimulates palmitate-induced MitoSOX oxidation. We also show that palmitate does not change the level of mitochondrial uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2) and that UCP2 knockdown does not affect palmitate-induced MitoSOX oxidation. Palmitoleate does not influence MitoSOX oxidation in INS-1E cells \u00b1UCP2 and largely prevents the palmitate-induced effects. Importantly, UCP2 knockdown amplifies the preventive effect of palmitoleate on palmitate-induced ROS. Consistently, viability effects of palmitate and palmitoleate are similar between cells \u00b1UCP2, but UCP2 knockdown significantly augments the palmitoleate protection against palmitate-induced cell loss at high glucose.

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) is a frontline MM drug; however, intrinsic or acquired resistance to BTZ remains a clinical hurdle. As BTZ induces oxidative stress in MM cells, we queried if altered redox homeostasis promotes BTZ resistance. In primary human MM samples, increased gene expression of copper\u2013zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD or SOD1) correlated with cancer progression, high-risk disease, and adverse overall and event-free survival outcomes. As an in vitro model, human MM cell lines (MM.1S, 8226, U266) and the BTZ-resistant (BR) lines (MM.1SBR, 8226BR) were utilized to determine the role of antioxidants in intrinsic or acquired BTZ-resistance. An up-regulation of CuZnSOD, glutathione peroxidase-1 (GPx-1), and glutathione (GSH) were associated with BTZ resistance and attenuated prooxidant production by BTZ. Enforced overexpression of SOD1 induced BTZ resistance and pharmacological inhibition of CuZnSOD with disulfiram (DSF) augmented BTZ cytotoxicity in both BTZ-sensitive and BTZ-resistant cell lines.

A LOX-derived oxidized phospholipid, 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid-phosphatidylethanolamine (12-HETE-PE) was found to be a preferred substrate for yeast Atg8 lipidation, versus native PE, while both native and oxidized PE were effective substrates for LC3 lipidation. Last, phospholipidomics demonstrated altered levels of several phospholipid classes. Thus, we show that oxidized phospholipids generated by 12/15-LOX can act as substrates for key proteins required for effective autophagy and that cells deficient in this enzyme show evidence of autophagic dysfunction.

     "abstract": "In recent years, numerous studies have demonstrated the health benefits of polyphenols. A major portion of polyphenols in western diet are derived from coffee, which is one of the most consumed beverages in the world.It has been shown that many polyphenols gain their beneficial properties (e.g. cancer prevention) through the activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway as well as their direct antioxidant activity. However, activation of Nrf2 in cancer cells might lead to resistance towards therapy through induction of phase II enzymes.In the present work we hypothesize that caffeic acid (CA), a coffee polyphenol, might act as an electrophile in addition to its nucleophilic properties and is capable of inducing the Nrf2/EpRE pathway in cancer cells.The results indicate that CA induces Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus and consequently its transcription. It has been demonstrated that generated hydrogen peroxide is involved in the induction process. It has also been found that this process is induced predominantly via the double bond in CA (Michael acceptor). However, surprisingly the presence of both nucleophilic and electrophilic moieties in CA resulted in a synergetic activation of Nrf2 and phase II enzymes.We also found that CA possesses a dual activity, although inducing GSTP1 and GSR, it inhibiting their enzymatic activity.In conclusion, the mechanism of induction of Nrf2 pathway and phase II enzymes by CA has been elucidated. The electrophilic moiety in CA is essential for the oxidation of the Keap1 protein. It should be noted that while the nucleophilic moiety (the catechol/quinone moiety) can provide scavenging ability, it cannot contribute directly to Nrf2 induction. It was found that this process may be induced by H2O2 produced by the catechol group.On the whole, it appears that CA might play a major role in the cancer cells by enhancing their resistance to treatment.",

     "abstract": "The cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidase enzymes play a major role in the metabolism of important endogenous substrates as well as in the biotransformation of xenobiotics. The liver P450 system is the most active in metabolism of exogenous substrates. This review briefly describes the liver P450 (CYP) mixed function oxidase system with respect to its enzymatic components and functions. Electron transfer by the NADPH-P450 oxidoreductase is required for reduction of the heme of P450, necessary for binding of molecular oxygen. Binding of substrates to P450 produce substrate binding spectra. The P450 catalytic cycle is complex and rate-limiting steps are not clear. Many types of chemical reactions can be catalyzed by P450 enzymes, making this family among the most diverse catalysts known. There are multiple forms of P450s arranged into families based on structural homology. The major drug metabolizing CYPs are discussed with respect to typical substrates, inducers and inhibitors and their polymorphic forms. The composition of CYPs in humans varies considerably among individuals because of sex and age differences, the influence of diet, liver disease, presence of potential inducers and/or inhibitors. Because of such factors and CYP polymorphisms, and overlapping drug specificity, there is a large variability in the content and composition of P450 enzymes among individuals. This can result in large variations in drug metabolism by humans and often can contribute to drug\u2013drug interactions and adverse drug reactions. Because of many of the above factors, especially CYP polymorphisms, there has been much interest in personalized medicine especially with respect to which CYPs and which of their polymorphic forms are present in order to attempt to determine what drug therapy and what dosage would reflect the best therapeutic strategy in treating individual patients.",

     "abstract": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) is rapidly expressed by various stimuli and plays a key role in conversion of free arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. We have previously identified 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), a lipid peroxidation-derived electrophile, as the potent Cox-2 inducer in rat epithelial RL34 cells and revealed that the HNE-induced Cox-2 expression resulted from the stabilization of Cox-2 mRNA that is mediated by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In the present study, we investigated an alternative regulatory mechanism of Cox-2 expression mediated by a transcription factor p53. In addition, to characterize the causal role for Cox-2, we examined the effects of Cox-2 overexpression in RL34 cells. To examine whether the HNE-induced Cox-2 expression was mechanistically linked to the p53 expression, we analyzed changes in Cox-2 and p53 expression levels in response to HNE and observed that the Cox-2 levels were inversely correlated with the p53 levels. Down-regulation of p53 followed by the activation of a transcription factor Sp1 was suggested to be involved in the HNE-induced Cox-2 gene expression. To characterize the effect of Cox-2 expression in the cells, we established the Cox-2-overexpressing derivatives of RL34 cells by stable transfection with Cox-2 cDNA. An oligonucleotide microarray analysis revealed a dramatic down-regulation of the proteasome subunit RC1 in the Cox-2 overexpressed cells compared to the empty-vector transfected control cells. Consistent with the Cox-2-mediated down-regulation of proteasome, a moderate reduction of the proteasome activities was observed. This proteasome dysfunction mediated by the Cox-2 overproduction was associated with the enhanced accumulation of p53 and ubiquitinated proteins, leading to the enhanced sensitivity toward electrophiles. These results suggest the existence of a causal link between Cox-2 and p53, which may represent a toxic mechanism of electrophilic lipid peroxidation products.",

     "abstract": "Epalrestat (EPS) is the only aldose reductase inhibitor that is currently available for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. Recently, we found that EPS at near-plasma concentration increases the intracellular levels of glutathione (GSH) in rat Schwann cells. GSH plays a crucial role in protecting endothelial cells from oxidative stress, thereby preventing vascular diseases. Here we show that EPS increases GSH levels in not only Schwann cells but also endothelial cells. Treatment of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs), an in vitro model of the vascular endothelium, with EPS caused a dramatic increase in intracellular GSH levels. This was concomitant with the up-regulation of glutamate cysteine ligase, an enzyme catalyzing the first and rate-limiting step in de novo GSH synthesis. Moreover, EPS stimulated the expression of thioredoxin and heme oxygenase-1, which have important redox regulatory functions in endothelial cells. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor that regulates the expression of antioxidant genes. EPS increased nuclear Nrf2 levels in BAECs. Nrf2 knockdown by siRNA suppressed the EPS-induced glutamate cysteine ligase, thioredoxin-1, and heme oxygenase-1 expression. Interestingly, LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, abolished the EPS-stimulated GSH synthesis, suggesting that the kinase is associated with Nrf2 activation induced by EPS. Furthermore, EPS reduced the cytotoxicity induced by H2O2 and tert-butylhydroperoxide, indicating that EPS plays a role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Taken together, the results provide evidence that EPS exerts new beneficial effects on endothelial cells by increasing GSH, thioredoxin, and heme oxygenase-1 levels through the activation of Nrf2. We suggest that EPS has the potential to prevent several vascular diseases caused by oxidative stress.",

     "abstract": "Vascular aging is associated with structural and functional modifications of the arteries, and by an increase in arterial wall thickening in the intima and the media, mainly resulting from structural modifications of the extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Among the factors known to accumulate with aging, advanced lipid peroxidation end products (ALEs) are a hallmark of oxidative stress-associated diseases such as atherosclerosis. Aldehydes generated from the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), (4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde, acrolein), form adducts on cellular proteins, leading to a progressive protein dysfunction with consequences in the pathophysiology of vascular aging. The contribution of these aldehydes to ECM modification is not known. This study was carried out to investigate whether aldehyde-adducts are detected in the intima and media in human aorta, whether their level is increased in vascular aging, and whether elastin fibers are a target of aldehyde-adduct formation. Immunohistological and confocal immunofluorescence studies indicate that 4-HNE-histidine-adducts accumulate in an age-related manner in the intima, media and adventitia layers of human aortas, and are mainly expressed in smooth muscle cells. In contrast, even if the structure of elastin fiber is strongly altered in the aged vessels, our results show that elastin is not or very poorly modified by 4-HNE. These data indicate a complex role for lipid peroxidation and in particular for 4-HNE in elastin homeostasis, in the vascular wall remodeling during aging and atherosclerosis development.",

The role of nSMase2 in apoptosis is debated, and apparently contradictory results have been observed on fibroblasts isolated from nSMase2-deficient fragilitas ossium (homozygous fro/fro) mice. These mice exhibit a severe neonatal dysplasia, a lack of long bone mineralization and delayed apoptosis patterns of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate. We hypothesized that apoptosis induced by nutrient deprivation, which mimics the environmental modifications of the growth plate, requires nSMase2 activation. In this study, we have compared the resistance of fro/fro fibroblasts to different death inducers (oxidized LDL, hydrogen peroxide and nutrient starvation). The data show that nSMase2-deficient fro/fro cells resist to apoptosis evoked by nutrient starvation (fetal calf serum/glucose/pyruvate-free DMEM), whereas wt fibroblasts die after 48\u00a0h incubation in this medium. In contrast, oxidized LDL and hydrogen peroxide are similarly toxic to fro/fro and wt fibroblasts, indicating that nSMase2 is not involved in the mechanism of toxicity evoked by these agents. Interestingly, wt fibroblasts treated with the SMase inhibitor GW4869 were more resistant to starvation-induced apoptosis.The resistance of fro/fro cells to starvation-induced apoptosis is associated with an increased expression of hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) mRNAs and protein, which is inhibited by ceramide. In wt fibroblasts, this HAS2 rise and its protective effect did not occur, but exogenously added HA exhibited a protective effect against starvation-induced apoptosis.The protective mechanism of HAS2 involves an increased expression of the heat-shock protein Hsp72, a chaperone with antiapoptotic activity. Taken together, these results highlight the role of nSMase2 in apoptosis evoked by nutrient starvation that could contribute to the delayed apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plate, and emphasize the antiapoptotic properties of HAS2.",

Furthermore, enhanced clonogenic cell killing seen with the combination of DHEA+Au was nearly completely inhibited using the thiol antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 20\u00a0mM). Redox Western blot analysis of PC-3 cells also supported the conclusion that thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) oxidation was enhanced by treatment DHEA+Au and inhibited by NAC. Importantly, normal human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC) were not as sensitive to 2DG, DHEA, and Au combinations as their cancer cell counterparts (MDA-MB-231).

Several studies have evidenced that we are exposed through food to significant concentrations of HNE that could pose a toxicological concern. It is then of importance to known how HNE is metabolized after oral administration. Although its metabolism has been studied after intravenous administration in order to mimick endogenous formation, its in vivo fate after oral administration had never been studied.In order to identify and quantify urinary HNE metabolites after oral administration in rats, radioactive and stable isotopes of HNE were used and urine was analyzed by radio-chromatography (radio-HPLC) and chromatography coupled with High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (HPLC\u2013HRMS).Radioactivity distribution revealed that 48% of the administered radioactivity was excreted into urine and 15% into feces after 24\u00a0h, while 3% were measured in intestinal contents and 2% in major organs, mostly in the liver. Urinary radio-HPLC profiles revealed 22 major peaks accounting for 88% of the urinary radioactivity. For identification purpose, HNE and its stable isotope [1,2-13C]-HNE were given at equimolar dose to be able to univocally identify HNE metabolites by tracking twin peaks on HPLC\u2013HRMS spectra. The major peak was identified as 9-hydroxy-nonenoic acid (27% of the urinary radioactivity) followed by classical HNE mercapturic acid derivatives (the mercapturic acid conjugate of di-hydroxynonane (DHN-MA), the mercapturic acid conjugate of 4-hydroxynonenoic acid (HNA-MA) in its opened and lactone form) and by metabolites that are oxidized in the terminal position. New urinary metabolites as thiomethyl and glucuronide conjugates were also evidenced. Some analyses were also performed on feces and gastro-intestinal contents, revealing the presence of tritiated water that could originate from beta-oxidation reactions.",

A previous study had described orders of magnitude variance that existed when protein carbonyls were analysed in a single laboratory by ELISA using different commercial kits. We have further explored the potential causes of variance in carbonyl analysis in a ring study. A soluble protein fraction was prepared from rat liver and exposed to 0, 5 and 15\u00a0min of UV irradiation. Lyophilised preparations were distributed to six different laboratories that routinely undertook protein carbonyl analysis across Europe. ELISA and Western blotting techniques detected an increase in protein carbonyl formation between 0 and 5\u00a0min of UV irradiation irrespective of method used. After irradiation for 15\u00a0min, less oxidation was detected by half of the laboratories than after 5\u00a0min irradiation. Three of the four ELISA carbonyl results fell within 95% confidence intervals. Likely errors in calculating absolute carbonyl values may be attributed to differences in standardisation. Out of up to 88 proteins identified as containing carbonyl groups after tryptic cleavage of irradiated and control liver proteins, only seven were common in all three liver preparations. Lysine and arginine residues modified by carbonyls are likely to be resistant to tryptic proteolysis. Use of a cocktail of proteases may increase the recovery of oxidised peptides. In conclusion, standardisation is critical for carbonyl analysis and heavily oxidised proteins may not be effectively analysed by any existing technique.",

Accumulation of intracellular lipids was significantly increased in HepG2 cells incubated with fatty acid (FA) complex (1\u00a0mM, 2:1 oleic and palmitic acids). In FA-treated cells, lipid droplets were localized around the nucleus and seemed to induce mechanical force, leading to the disruption of the nucleus morphology. Level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly increased in FA-loaded cells and was further augmented by treatment with moderate stressor (CoCl2). Increased ROS resulted in formation of reactive carbonyls (aldehydes and ketones, derived from lipid peroxidation) with a strong perinuclear accumulation. Mass-spectroscopy analysis indicated that lipid accumulation per-se can results in modification of nuclear protein by reactive lipid peroxidation products (oxoLPP). 235 Modified proteins involved in transcription regulation, splicing, protein synthesis and degradation, DNA repair and lipid metabolism were identified uniquely in FA-treated cells.

The aim of this work was to investigate whether this system plays a role in actin remodeling induced by H2O2.Low H2O2 dose (5\u00a0\u00b5M) rapidly triggered a signaling cascade leading to nSMase2 activation, src and annexin 2 (AnxA2) phosphorylation, and actin remodeling, in fibroblasts and SMC. These events were blocked by pharmacological inhibitors of MMPs (Ro28-2653) and p38MAPK (SB203580), and were lacking in MMP2\u2212/\u2212 and in nSMase2-mutant (fro) fibroblasts. Likewise, H2O2 was unable to induce actin remodeling in fro and MMP2\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts or in cells pretreated with p38MAPK, or MMP inhibitors. Finally we show that nSMase2 activation by H2O2, depends on MMP2 and p38MAPK, and is required for the src-dependent phosphorylation of AnxA2, and actin remodeling.Taken together, these findings indicate for the first time that AnxA2 phosphorylation and actin remodeling evoked by oxidative stress depend on the sphingolipid pathway, via MMP2 and p38MAPK.",

Still, the dissection of causal relationships has turned out to be remarkably difficult. Here, we have analyzed global protein oxidation in terms of carbonylation of membrane proteins and cytoplasmic proteins in three different mammalian species: aged human cortex and cerebellum from patients with or without Alzheimer's disease, mouse cortex and cerebellum from young and old animals, and adult rat hippocampus and cortex subjected or not subjected to cerebral ischemia. Most tissues showed relatively similar levels of protein oxidation. However, human cortex was affected by severe membrane protein oxidation, while exhibiting lower than average cytoplasmic protein oxidation. In contrast, ex vivo autooxidation of murine cortical tissue primarily induced aqueous protein oxidation, while in vivo biological aging or cerebral ischemia had no major effect on brain protein oxidation. The unusually high levels of membrane protein oxidation in the human cortex were also not predicted by lipid peroxidation, as the levels of isoprostane immunoreactivity in human samples were considerably lower than in rodent tissues. Our results indicate that the aged human cortex is under steady pressure from specific and potentially detrimental membrane protein oxidation. The pronounced difference between humans, mice and rats regarding the primary site of cortical oxidation might have contributed to the unresolved difficulties in translating into therapies the wealth of data describing successful antioxidant neuroprotection in rodents.",

If untreated over time, end stage renal disease (ESRD) is an inevitable outcome. Acute and chronic kidney diseases occur partly due to imbalance between the molecular mechanisms that govern oxidative stress, inflammation, autophagy and cell death. Oxidative stress refers to the cumulative effects of highly reactive oxidizing molecules that cause cellular damage. Autophagy removes damaged organelles, protein aggregates and pathogens by recruiting these substrates into double membrane vesicles called autophagosomes which subsequently fuse with lysosomes. Mounting evidence suggests that both oxidative stress and autophagy are significantly involved in kidney health and disease. However, very little is known about the signaling processes that link them. This review is focused on understanding the role of oxidative stress and autophagy in kidney diseases. In this review, we also discuss the potential relationships between oxidative stress and autophagy that may enable the development of better therapeutic intervention to halt the progression of kidney disease and promote its repair and resolution.",

Herein we investigated the modulation of the activity of the cerebral transmembrane electrogenic enzyme in Fe2+-mediated in vitro oxidative stress model. The results show that Fe2+ inhibited the transmembrane enzyme in a concentration dependent manner and this effect was accompanied by a biphasic generation of aldehydic product of lipid peroxidation. While dithiothreitol prevented both Fe2+ inhibitory effect on the pump and lipid peroxidation, vitamin E prevented only lipid peroxidation but not inhibition of the pump. Besides, malondialdehyde (MDA) inhibited the pump by a mechanism not related to oxidation of its critical thiols. Apparently, the low activity of the pump in degenerative diseases mediated by Fe2+ may involve complex multi-component mechanisms which may partly involve an initial oxidation of the critical thiols of the enzyme directly mediated by Fe2+ and during severe progression of such diseases; aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation such as MDA may further exacerbate this inhibitory effect by a mechanism that is likely not related to the oxidation of the catalytically essential thiols of the ouabain-sensitive cerebral electrogenic pump.",

     "abstract": "Respiratory complex I inhibition by drugs and other chemicals has been implicated as a frequent mode of mitochondria-mediated cell injury. However, the exact mechanisms leading to the activation of cell death pathways are incompletely understood. This study was designed to explore the relative contributions to cell injury of three distinct consequences of complex I inhibition, i.e., impairment of ATP biosynthesis, increased formation of superoxide and, hence, peroxynitrite, and inhibition of the mitochondrial protein deacetylase, Sirt3, due to imbalance of the NADH/NAD+ ratio. We used the antiviral drug efavirenz (EFV) to model drug-induced complex I inhibition. Exposure of cultured mouse hepatocytes to EFV resulted in a rapid onset of cell injury, featuring a no-effect level at 30\u00a0\u00b5M EFV and submaximal effects at 50\u00a0\u00b5M EFV. EFV caused a concentration-dependent decrease in cellular ATP levels. Furthermore, EFV resulted in increased formation of peroxynitrite and oxidation of mitochondrial protein thiols, including cyclophilin D (CypD). This was prevented by the superoxide scavenger, Fe-TCP, or the peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst, Fe-TMPyP. Both ferroporphyrins completely protected from EFV-induced cell injury, suggesting that peroxynitrite contributed to the cell injury. Finally, EFV increased the NADH/NAD+ ratio, inhibited Sirt3 activity, and led to hyperacetylated lysine residues, including those in CypD. However, hepatocytes isolated from Sirt3-null mice were protected against 40\u00a0\u00b5M EFV as compared to their wild-type controls. In conclusion, these data are compatible with the concept that chemical inhibition of complex I activates multiple pathways leading to cell injury; among these, peroxynitrite formation may be the most critical.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a major part in the pathogenesis of drug-induced liver injury. Yet, overcoming it with other xenobiotics impose additional risks. In this study, we consider the use of natural-occurring and purified Vitamin E analogs as hepatoprotective agents. Vitamin E is well-known for its intrinsic antioxidant property even though the differential effect of specific analogs of tocopherol (TP) and tocotrienol (T3) is still not ascertained. This study investigates the protective effect of T3 analogs (\u03b1-, \u03b4-, \u03b3\u2212) in comparison with \u03b1-TP followed by assessing the underlying mechanisms of the cytoprotective T3 analog(s) in two xenobiotics-induced liver injury models using (1) acetaminophen (APAP)- and (2) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Both \u03b1-TP and \u03b1-T3 exerted cytoprotective effects while only lower concentration of \u03b3-T3 was effective in inhibiting both toxicants induced injury. \u03b1-TP/\u03b1-T3 protected hepatocytes from APAP and H2O2-induced liver injury through arresting free radicals and inhibiting oxidative stress (inhibition of reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial permeability transition). There was also demonstrable inhibition of the apoptotic pathway (inhibition of caspse-3 activity and overexpression of Bcl-XL), accompanied with an induction of liver regeneration (PCNA and NF-kB). The cellular uptake of \u03b1-T3 was higher than \u03b1-TP at the same treatment dosage after 24\u00a0h. Overall, \u03b1-T3 seems to be a more potent hepatoprotective analog among the tocotrienols and \u03b1-TP at the same in vitro treatment dosage. In summary, these results suggest that \u03b1-TP/\u03b1-T3 elicit hepatoprotective effects against toxicants-induced damage mainly through activation of antioxidant responses at an early stage to prevent the exacerbation of injury.",

Activation of NOX2 requires the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity of peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6). Therefore, we evaluated whether blocking Prdx6 PLA2 activity using the inhibitor MJ33 would be protective in a mouse model of acute lung injury resulting from hyperoxic exposure. Mice were treated with an intraperitoneal injection of MJ33 (2.5\u00a0nmol/g body weight) at the start of exposure (zero time) and at 48\u00a0h during continuous exposure to 100% O2 for 80\u00a0h. Treatment with MJ33 reduced the number of neutrophils and the protein content in the fluid obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, inhibited the increase in lipid peroxidation products in lung tissue, decreased the number of apoptotic cells in the lung, and decreased the perivascular edema associated with the 80\u00a0h exposure to hyperoxia. Thus, blocking Prdx6 PLA2 activity by MJ33 significantly protected lungs against damage from hyperoxia, presumably by preventing the activation of NOX2 and the amplification of lung injury associated with inflammation. These findings demonstrate that MJ33, a potent inhibitor of Prdx6 PLA2 activity, can protect mouse lungs against the manifestations of acute lung injury due to oxidative stress.",

We studied the early stages of M.abs infection of macrophages, with emphasis on the role of heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in this infection. THP-1 cells were activated using TPA into macrophage-like cells and infected with M.abs for different time points. M.abs infection robustly induced HO-1 expression in the THP-1 cells. Production of HO-1 was p38 MAPK-dependent, as p38 inhibitors suppressed HO-1 induction. Pretreatment with HO-1 inhibitors tin-protoporphyrin (SnPP) significantly inhibited M.abs growth inside macrophages. Furthermore, inhibiting HO-1 using HO-1 siRNA or the HO-1 upstream signaling molecule; Nrf2 using Nrf2 siRNA resulted in similar inhibition of M.abs. In contrast, inducing HO-1 did not increase M.abs intracellular growth above control. Products of HO-1 metabolism of heme are bilirubin, biliverdin, carbon monoxide (CO) and iron. The addition of either bilirubin or biliverdin, but not CO, completely restored the SnPP inhibitory effect and partially that with HO-1 siRNA. To understand the mechanisms, we used Syto-62 labeled M.abs to infect macrophages. Interestingly, HO-1 inhibition promoted M.abs-containing phagosome fusion with lysosomes, which should enhance M.abs killing. M.abs infection enhanced THP-1 ROS production as demonstrated by increased DHE, DCF fluorescence, and EPR signal. HO-1 inhibition further increased ROS production in infected macrophages. Our results indicate that HO-1 induction is important for M.abs growth during the early stages of infection, and that the HO-1 products bilirubin and biliverdin, perhaps through modulation of intracellular ROS levels, may be involved.",

     "abstract": "Vascular endothelial cells (ECs) are important for maintaining vascular homeostasis. Dysfunction of ECs contributes to cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, and can impair the healing process during vascular injury. An important mediator of EC response to stress is the GTPase Rac1. Rac1 responds to extracellular signals and is involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement, reactive oxygen species generation and cell cycle progression. Rac1 interacts with effector proteins to elicit EC spreading and formation of cell-to-cell junctions. Rac1 activity has recently been shown to be modulated by glutathiolation or S-nitrosation via an active site cysteine residue. However, it is not known whether other redox signaling compounds can modulate Rac1 activity. An important redox signaling mediator is the electrophilic lipid, 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2). This compound is a downstream product of cyclooxygenase and forms covalent adducts with specific cysteine residues, and induces cellular signaling in a pleiotropic manner. In this study, we demonstrate that a biotin-tagged analog of 15d-PGJ2 (bt-15d-PGJ2) forms an adduct with Rac1 in vitro at the C157 residue, and an additional adduct was detected on the tryptic peptide associated with C178. Rac1 modification in addition to modulation of Rac1 activity by bt-15d-PGJ2 was observed in cultured ECs. In addition, decreased EC migration and cell spreading were observed in response to the electrophile. These results demonstrate for the first time that Rac1 is a target for 15d-PGJ2 in ECs, and suggest that Rac1 modification by electrophiles such as 15d-PGJ2 may alter redox signaling and EC function.",

Mitochondria-targeted superoxide scavenger mitoTEMPO reduces blood pressure; however, the structure\u2013functional relationships in antihypertensive effect of mitochondria-targeted nitroxides remain unclear. The nitroxides are known to undergo bioreduction into hydroxylamine derivatives which reacts with O 2 - \u2022 with much lower rate. The nitroxides of pyrrolidine series (proxyls) are much more resistant to bioreduction compared to TEMPOL derivatives suggesting that mitochondria-targeted proxyls can be effective antioxidants with antihypertensive activity. In this work we have designed and studied two new pyrrolidine mitochondria targeted nitroxides: 3-[2-(triphenyphosphonio)acetamido]- and 3-[2-(triphenyphosphonio) acetamidomethyl]-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidine-1-oxyl (mCP2) and (mCP1). These new mitochondria targeted nitroxides have 3- to 7-fold lower rate constants of the reaction with O 2 - \u2022 compared with mitoTEMPO; however, the cellular bioreduction of mCP1 and mCP2 was 3- and 2-fold slower. As a consequence incubation with cells afforded much higher intracellular concentration of mCP1 and mCP2 nitroxides compared to mitoTEMPO nitroxide. This has compensated for the difference in the rate of O 2 - \u2022 scavenging and all nitroxides similarly protected mitochondrial respiration in H2O2 treated endothelial cells. Treatment of hypertensive mice with mCP1 and mCP2 (1.4\u00a0mg/kg/day) after onset of angiotensin II-induced hypertension significantly reduced blood pressure to 133\u00b15\u00a0mmHg and 129\u00b16\u00a0mmHg compared to 163\u00b15\u00a0mmHg in mice infused with angiotensin II alone. mCP1 and mCP2 reduced vascular O 2 - \u2022 and prevented decrease of endothelial nitric oxide production. These data indicate that resistance to bioreduction play significant role in antioxidant activity of nitroxides. Studies of nitroxide analogs such as mCP1 and mCP2 may help in optimization of chemical structure of mitochondria-targeted nitroxides for improved efficacy and pharmacokinetics of these drugs in treatment of hypertension and many other conditions including atherosclerosis, diabetes and degenerative neurological disorders in which mitochondrial oxidative stress seems to play a role.",

     "abstract": "Enhanced mitochondrial generation of oxidants, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), is related to a large number of pathological conditions, including diet-induced obesity and steatohepatosis. Indeed, we have previously shown that high fat diets increase the generation of H2O2 in liver mitochondria energized by activated fatty acids. Here, we further study fatty-acid induced H2O2 release in liver mitochondria, and determine the characteristics that regulate it. We find that this production of H2O2 is independent of mitochondrial inner membrane integrity and insensitive to purine nucleotides. On the other hand, palmitate-induced H2O2 production is strongly enhanced by high fat diets and is pH-sensitive, with a peak at a matrix pH of ~8.5. Using recombinantly expressed human very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, we are able to demonstrate that palmitate-induced H2O2 release may be ascribed to the activity of this enzyme alone, acting as an oxidase. Our results add to a number of findings indicating that sources outside of the electron transport chain can generate significant, physiopathologically relevant, amounts of oxidants in mitochondria.",

Although ROS can induce cell damage through direct effects on cellular macromolecules, the injurious effects of ROS are mediated largely through changes in signal transduction pathways such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In response to alcohol, hepatocytes have increased levels of the enzyme cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) which generates an oxidant stress that promotes the development of alcoholic steatosis and liver injury. These effects are mediated in large part through overactivation of JNK that alters cell death pathways. Targeting the JNK pathway or its downstream effectors may be a useful therapeutic approach to the oxidative stress generated by CYP2E1 in alcoholic liver disease.",

These hydrolytic systems are not unique to liver cells; they exist in all eukaryotic tissues and cells. However, because the liver is the principal site of ethanol metabolism, it sustains the greatest damage from heavy drinking. Thus, the focus of this review is to specifically describe how ethanol oxidation modulates the activities of the UPS and autophagy and the mechanisms by which these changes contribute to the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury. Here, we describe the history and the importance of cellular hydrolytic systems, followed by a description of each catabolic pathway and the differential modulation of each by ethanol exposure. Overall, the evidence for an involvement of these catabolic systems in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease is quite strong. It underscores their importance, not only as effective means of cellular recycling and eventual energy generation, but also as essential components of cellular defense.",

     "abstract": "Chronic alcohol use can result in many pathological effects including alcoholic liver disease (ALD). While alcohol is necessary for the development of ALD, only 20\u201330% of alcoholics develop alcoholic steatohepatitis (ASH) with progressive liver disease leading to cirrhosis and liver failure (ALD). This suggests that while chronic alcohol consumption is necessary it is not sufficient to induce clinically relevant liver damage in the absence of a secondary risk factor. Studies in rodent models and alcoholic patients show that increased intestinal permeability to microbial products like endotoxin play a critical role in promoting liver inflammation in ALD pathogenesis. Therefore identifying mechanisms of alcohol-induced intestinal permeability is important in identifying mechanisms of ALD and for designing new avenues for therapy. Cyp2e1 is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that metabolizes alcohol has been shown to be upregulated by chronic alcohol use and to be a major source of oxidative stress and liver injury in alcoholics and in animal and in vitro models of chronic alcohol use. Because Cyp2e1 is also expressed in the intestine and is upregulated by chronic alcohol use, we hypothesized it could play a role in alcohol-induced intestinal hyperpermeability. Our in vitro studies with intestinal Caco-2 cells and in mice fed alcohol showed that circadian clock proteins CLOCK and PER2 are required for alcohol-induced permeability. We also showed that alcohol increases Cyp2e1 protein and activity but not mRNA in Caco-2 cells and that an inhibitor of oxidative stress or siRNA knockdown of Cyp2e1 prevents the increase in CLOCK or PER2 proteins and prevents alcohol-induced hyperpermeability. With our collaborators we have also shown that Cyp2e1 knockout mice are resistant to alcohol-induced gut leakiness and liver inflammation. Taken together our data support a novel Cyp2e1-circadian clock protein mechanism for alcohol-induced gut leakiness that could provide new avenues for therapy of ALD.",

In these latter the presence of anti-CYP2E1 auto-antibodies is an independent predictor of extensive necro-inflammation and fibrosis and worsens the recurrence of hepatitis following liver transplantation, indicating that CYP2E1-directed autoimmunity can contribute to hepatic injury. The molecular characterization of the antigens recognized by anti-CYP2E1 auto-antibodies in ALD and CHC has shown that the targeted conformational epitopes are located in close proximity on the molecular surface. Furthermore, these epitopes can be recognized on CYP2E1 expressed on hepatocyte plasma membranes where they can trigger antibody-mediated cytotoxicity. This does not exclude that T cell-mediated responses against CYP2E1 might also be involved in causing hepatocyte damage. CYP2E1 structural modifications by reactive metabolites and molecular mimicry represent important factors in the breaking of self-tolerance against CYP2E1 in, respectively, ALD and CHC. However, genetic or acquired interferences with the mechanisms controlling the homeostasis of the immune system are also likely to contribute. More studies are needed to better characterize the impact of anti-CYP2E1 autoimmunity in liver diseases particularly in relation to the fact that common metabolic alterations such as obesity and diabetes stimulates hepatic CYP2E1 expression.",

LPO products are generated either via inflammation driven oxidative stress or via the induction of cytochrome P-450 2E1 (CYP2E1). In the liver CYP2E1 is induced by various compounds including free fatty acids, acetone and ethanol. Increased levels of CYP2E1 and thus, oxidative stress are observed in the liver of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as in the chronic alcoholic. In addition, chronic ethanol ingestion also increases CYP2E1 in the mucosa of the oesophagus and colon. In all these tissues CYP2E1 correlates significantly with the levels of carcinogenic etheno-DNA adducts. In contrast, in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) hepatic etheno-DNA adducts do not correlate with CYP2E1 indicating that in NASH etheno-DNA adducts formation is predominately driven by inflammation rather than by CYP2E1 induction. Since etheno-DNA adducts are strong mutagens producing various types of base pair substitution mutations as well as other types of genetic damage, it is strongly believed that they are involved in ethanol mediated carcinogenesis primarily driven by the induction of CYP2E1.",

Our aim was to investigate the influence of cholesterol on the activation process of NADPH oxidase. Our results clearly show that, in a cell-free system, cholesterol is not an efficient activator of NADPH oxidase like arachidonic acid (AA), however it triggers a basal low superoxide production at concentrations similar to what found in neutrophile. A higher concentration, if present during the assembly process of the enzyme, has an inhibitory role on the production of O2\u2022\u2212. Added cholesterol acts on both cytosolic and membrane components, leading to imperfect assembly and decreasing the affinity of cytosolic subunits to the membrane ones.

Our previous research shows NLRP3 inflammasome activation signal originates from defects in autophagy. Yet how the fatty acid related to mitophagy alteration leads to the activation of NLRP3-ASC inflammasome has not been considered. Here we demonstrated that palmitate (PA) induced mitophagy deficiency, leading to damaged mitochondrion as characterized by mito-ROS production and loss of membrane potential. Antioxidant APDC or Ca2+ signaling inhibitor Nifedipine blocked PA-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Further, we provided evidences that PA reduced the expression of Ras homolog enriched in brain (Rheb) and disrupted Rheb recruitment to the mitochondrial outer membrane. In addition, sustained PA caused disassociation of kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) from binding with mitochondria via Ca2+-dependent effects. Disruption of Rheb and KIF5B interaction with mitochondria blocked mitochondrial degradation along with IL-1\u03b2 dependent insulin resistance, which was majorly attenuated by Rheb/KIF5B overexpression. In a consequence, defective mitophagy led to the accumulation of damaged-ROS-generating mitochondria, down pathway of NLRP3-ASC-Caspase 1 activation, and subsequently, insulin resistance.

Mitochondrial oxidants are produced in excess in cancer cells due to oncogenic transformation and metabolic reorganization, and signals through FOXM1 and other redox-responsive factors to support a hyper-proliferative state. Over-expression of PRX3 in cancer cells has been shown to counteract oncogene-induced senescence and support tumor cell growth and survival making PRX3 a credible therapeutic target. Using malignant mesothelioma (MM) cells stably expressing shRNAs to PRX3 we show that decreased expression of PRX3 alters mitochondrial structure, function and cell cycle kinetics. As compared to control cells, knockdown of PRX3 expression increased mitochondrial membrane potential, basal ATP production, oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates. shPRX3 MM cells failed to progress through the cell cycle compared to wild type controls, with increased numbers of cells in G2/M phase. Diminished PRX3 expression also induced mitochondrial hyperfusion similar to the DRP1 inhibitor mdivi-1. Cell cycle progression and changes in mitochondrial networking were rescued by transient expression of either catalase or mitochondrial-targeted catalase, indicating high levels of hydrogen peroxide contribute to perturbations in mitochondrial structure and function in shPRX3 MM cells.

In this study, we found that estradiol (E2) treatment significantly increases the expression of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (SOD2) in mice and in vitro in human aorta endothelial cells. Further investigation shows that E2 up-regulates SOD2 through tethering of estrogen receptor (ER) to Sp1 and the increased binding of Sp1 to GC-box on the SOD2 promoter, where ER\u03b1 responses E2-mediated gene activation, and ER\u03b2 maintains basal gene expression level. The E2/ER-mediated SOD2 up-regulation results in minimized ROS generation, which highly favors healthy cardiovascular function. Gene therapy through lentivirus-carried endothelium-specific delivery to the vascular wall in high-fat diet (HFT) mice shows that the SOD2 expression in endothelial cells normalizes E2 deficiency-induced ROS generation with ameliorated mitochondrial dysfunction and vascular damage, while SOD2 knockdown worsens the problem despite the presence of E2, indicating that E2-induced SOD2 expression plays an important vasculoprotective role. To our knowledge, this is the first report for the mechanism by which E2 improves cardiovascular function through up-regulation of SOD2 in endothelial cells. In turn, this suggests a novel gene therapy through lentivirus-carried gene delivery to vascular wall for E2 deficiency-induced cardiovascular damage in postmenopausal women.",

While the pathogenesis of ALD is poorly characterized key players identified in experimental models and patients, such as perturbations in mitochondrial structure and function, selective loss of antioxidant defense and susceptibility to inflammatory cytokines, contribute to ALD progression. Both oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction compromise essential cellular functions and energy generation and hence are important pathogenic mechanisms of ALD. An important process mediating the mitochondrial disruption induced by alcohol intake is the trafficking of cholesterol to mitochondria, mediated by acid sphingomyelinase-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, which contributes to increased cholesterol synthesis and StARD1upregulation. Mitochondrial cholesterol accumulation not only sensitizes to oxidative stress but it can contribute to the metabolic reprogramming in ALD, manifested by activation of the hypoxia inducible transcription factor 1 and stimulation of glycolysis and lactate secretion. Thus, a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying alcohol-mediated mitochondrial impairment and oxidative stress may lead to the identification of novel treatments for ALD.

Under elevated nitroxidative stress, cellular macromolecules proteins, DNA, and lipids can undergo different oxidative modifications, leading to disruption of their normal, sometimes critical, physiological functions. Recent reports also indicated that many mitochondrial proteins are modified via various post-translation modifications (PTMs) and primarily inactivated. Because of the recently-emerging information, in this review, we specifically focus on the mechanisms and roles of five major PTMs (namely oxidation, nitration, phosphorylation, acetylation, and adduct formation with lipid-peroxides, reactive metabolites, or advanced glycation end products) in experimental models of alcoholic and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as well as acute hepatic injury caused by toxic compounds.

Further characterization of the downstream signaling pathway(s) involved in TGF-\u03b2-mediated fibrosis may lead to discovery of novel treatment strategies for fibrotic disorders. Accumulating evidence suggests that Nox4 NADPH oxidase may be an important downstream effector in mediating TGF-\u03b2-induced fibrosis, while NADPH oxidase-dependent redox signaling may in turn regulate TGF-\u03b2/Smad signaling in a feed-forward manner.

Despite promising anti-atherogenic features in vitro, vitamin E failed to be atheroprotective in clinical trials in humans.

Increased expression of CYP2E1 in response to high concentrations of ethanol leads to greater production of cytotoxic ethanol metabolites, which in turn contribute to production of reactive oxygen species, oxidative stress, and ultimately, cell death. Necroptotic hepatocyte cell death in response to ethanol is mediated via a CYP2E1-dependent expression of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3), a key component of the necroptosome. In response to alarmins released during ethanol-induced necroptosis, the innate immune response is activated. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a pro-inflammatory multikine involved in many disease processes, is an essential component to this response to injury. MIF expression is increased during ethanol exposure via a CYP2E1-dependent pathway, likely contributing to an exacerbated innate immune response and chronic inflammation after chronic ethanol. This review will discuss the complex interactions between CYP2E1-dependent expression of RIP3 and MIF in the pathophysiology of chronic ethanol-induced liver injury.",

     "abstract": "The proteasome is a multimeric and multicatalytic intracellular protease responsible for the degradation of proteins involved in cell cycle control, various signaling processes, antigen presentation, and control of protein synthesis. The central catalytic complex of the proteasome is called the 20S core particle. The majority of these are flanked on one or both sides by regulatory units. Most common among these units is the 19S regulatory unit. When coupled to the 19S unit, the complex is termed the asymmetric or symmetric 26S proteasome depending on whether one or both sides are coupled to the 19S unit, respectively. The 26S proteasome recognizes poly-ubiquitinylated substrates targeted for proteolysis. Targeted proteins interact with the 19S unit where they are deubiquitinylated, unfolded, and translocated to the 20S catalytic chamber for degradation. The 26S proteasome is responsible for the degradation of major proteins involved in the regulation of the cellular cycle, antigen presentation and control of protein synthesis. Alternatively, the proteasome is also active when dissociated from regulatory units. This free pool of 20S proteasome is described in yeast to mammalian cells. The free 20S proteasome degrades proteins by a process independent of poly-ubiquitinylation and ATP consumption. Oxidatively modified proteins and other substrates are degraded in this manner. The 20S proteasome comprises two central heptamers (\u03b2-rings) where the catalytic sites are located and two external heptamers (\u03b1-rings) that are responsible for proteasomal gating. Because the 20S proteasome lacks regulatory units, it is unclear what mechanisms regulate the gating of \u03b1-rings between open and closed forms. In the present review, we discuss 20S proteasomal gating modulation through a redox mechanism, namely, S-glutathionylation of cysteine residues located in the \u03b1-rings, and the consequence of this post-translational modification on 20S proteasomal function.",

Importantly, oxidative protein damage contributes to age-dependent accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria or protein aggregates. In addition, environmental toxins such as rotenone and paraquat, which are risk factors for the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, also promote protein oxidation. The obvious approach of supplementing the primary antioxidant systems designed to suppress the initiation of oxidative stress has been tested in animal models and positive results were obtained. However, these findings have not been effectively translated to treating human patients, and clinical trials for antioxidant therapies using radical scavenging molecules such as \u03b1-tocopherol, ascorbate and coenzyme Q have met with limited success, highlighting several limitations to this approach. These could include: (1) radical scavenging antioxidants cannot reverse established damage to proteins and organelles; (2) radical scavenging antioxidants are oxidant specific, and can only be effective if the specific mechanism for neurodegeneration involves the reactive species to which they are targeted and (3) since reactive species play an important role in physiological signaling, suppression of endogenous oxidants maybe deleterious. Therefore, alternative approaches that can circumvent these limitations are needed. While not previously considered an antioxidant system we propose that the autophagy-lysosomal activities, may serve this essential function in neurodegenerative diseases by removing damaged or dysfunctional proteins and organelles.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria have a myriad of essential functions including metabolism and apoptosis. These chief functions are reliant on electron transfer reactions and the production of ATP and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The production of ATP and ROS are intimately linked to the electron transport chain (ETC). Electrons from nutrients are passed through the ETC via a series of acceptor and donor molecules to the terminal electron acceptor molecular oxygen (O2) which ultimately drives the synthesis of ATP. Electron transfer through the respiratory chain and nutrient oxidation also produces ROS. At high enough concentrations ROS can activate mitochondrial apoptotic machinery which ultimately leads to cell death. However, if maintained at low enough concentrations ROS can serve as important signaling molecules. Various regulatory mechanisms converge upon mitochondria to modulate ATP synthesis and ROS production. Given that mitochondrial function depends on redox reactions, it is important to consider how redox signals modulate mitochondrial processes. Here, we provide the first comprehensive review on how redox signals mediated through cysteine oxidation, namely S-oxidation (sulfenylation, sulfinylation), S-glutathionylation, and S-nitrosylation, regulate key mitochondrial functions including nutrient oxidation, oxidative phosphorylation, ROS production, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), apoptosis, and mitochondrial fission and fusion. We also consider the chemistry behind these reactions and how they are modulated in mitochondria. In addition, we also discuss emerging knowledge on disorders and disease states that are associated with deregulated redox signaling in mitochondria and how mitochondria-targeted medicines can be utilized to restore mitochondrial redox signaling.",

It is an outcome of oxidative stress caused by interactions of reactive metabolites (RMs) interactions with lipids, proteins and other mechanisms of human body. Production of RMs mainly superoxide ( O 2 \u2212 ) has been found in a variety of predominating cellular enzyme systems including NAD(P)H oxidase, xanthine oxidase (XO), cyclooxygenase (COX), uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). The four main RM related molecular mechanisms are: increased polyol pathway flux; increased advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation; activation of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and increased hexosamine pathway flux which have been implicated in glucose-mediated vascular damage. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) are antioxidant enzymes involved in scavenging RMs in normal individuals. Functional polymorphisms of these antioxidant enzymes have been reported to be involved in pathogenesis of T2DM individuals. The low levels of antioxidant enzymes or their non-functionality results in excessive RMs which initiate stress related pathways thereby leading to insulin resistance and T2DM. An attempt has been made to review the role of RMs and antioxidant enzymes in oxidative stress resulting in T2DM.",

     "abstract": "Free radicals originate from both exogenous environmental sources and as by-products of the respiratory chain and cellular oxygen metabolism. Sustained accumulation of free radicals, beyond a physiological level, induces oxidative stress that is harmful for the cellular homeodynamics as it promotes the oxidative damage and stochastic modification of all cellular biomolecules including proteins. In relation to proteome stability and maintenance, the increased concentration of oxidants disrupts the functionality of cellular protein machines resulting eventually in proteotoxic stress and the deregulation of the proteostasis (homeostasis of the proteome) network (PN). PN curates the proteome in the various cellular compartments and the extracellular milieu by modulating protein synthesis and protein machines assembly, protein recycling and stress responses, as well as refolding or degradation of damaged proteins. Molecular chaperones are key players of the PN since they facilitate folding of nascent polypeptides, as well as holding, folding, and/or degradation of unfolded, misfolded, or non-native proteins. Therefore, the expression and the activity of the molecular chaperones are tightly regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational level at organismal states of increased oxidative and, consequently, proteotoxic stress, including ageing and various age-related diseases (e.g. degenerative diseases and cancer). In the current review we present a synopsis of the various classes of intra- and extracellular chaperones, the effects of oxidants on cellular homeodynamics and diseases and the redox regulation of chaperones.",

The Ubiquitin\u2013Proteasome System (UPS)1 is one of the main proteolytic systems that orchestrate protein degradation. Given that up- and down- regulation of the UPS system has been shown to occur in various normal (such as ageing) and pathological (such as neurodegenerative diseases) processes, the exogenous modulation of the UPS function and activity holds promise of (a) developing new therapeutic interventions against various diseases and (b) establishing strategies to maintain cellular homeostasis. Since the proteasome genes are evolutionarily conserved, their role can be dissected in simple model organisms, such as the nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. In this review, we survey findings on the redox regulation of the UPS in C. elegans showing that the nematode is an instrumental tool in the identification of major players in the UPS pathway. Moreover, we specifically discuss UPS-related genes that have been modulated in the nematode and in human cells and have resulted in similar effects thus further exhibiting the value of this model in the study of the UPS.",

     "abstract": "Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) are known to cause oxidative damage to DNA, proteins and lipids. In addition, recent evidence suggests that ROS can also initiate signaling cascades that respond to stress and modify specific redox-sensitive moieties as a regulatory mechanism. This suggests that ROS are physiologically-relevant signaling molecules. However, these sensor/effector molecules are not uniformly distributed throughout the cell. Moreover, localized ROS damage may elicit site-specific compensatory measures. Thus, the impact of ROS can be likened to that of calcium, a ubiquitous second messenger, leading to the prediction that their effects are exquisitely dependent upon their location, quantity and even the timing of generation. Despite this prediction, ROS signaling is most commonly intuited through the global administration of chemicals that produce ROS or by ROS quenching through global application of antioxidants. Optogenetics, which uses light to control the activity of genetically-encoded effector proteins, provides a means of circumventing this limitation. Photo-inducible genetically-encoded ROS-generating proteins (RGPs) were originally employed for their phototoxic effects and cell ablation. However, reducing irradiance and/or fluence can achieve sub-lethal levels of ROS that may mediate subtle signaling effects. Hence, transgenic expression of RGPs as fusions to native proteins gives researchers a new tool to exert spatial and temporal control over ROS production. This review will focus on the new frontier defined by the experimental use of RGPs to study ROS signaling.",

In early studies, the proteins most frequently analysed for damage were those which were more abundant in plasma (e.g. albumin and immunoglobulins) which exist at up to 10 orders of magnitude higher concentrations than other plasma proteins e.g. cytokines. However, advances in analytical techniques using mass spectrometry and immuno-affinity purification methods, have facilitated analysis of less abundant, modified proteins and the nature of modifications at specific sites is now being characterised. The damaging reactive species that cause protein modifications in plasma principally arise from reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NADPH oxidases (NOX), nitric oxide synthases (NOS) and oxygenase activities; reactive nitrogen species (RNS) from myeloperoxidase (MPO) and NOS activities; and hypochlorous acid from MPO. Secondary damage to proteins may be caused by oxidized lipids and glucose autooxidation.In this review, we focus on redox regulatory control of those enzymes and processes which control protein maturation during synthesis, produce reactive species, repair and remove damaged plasma proteins. We have highlighted the potential for alterations in the extracellular redox compartment to regulate intracellular redox state and, conversely, for intracellular oxidative stress to alter the cellular secretome and composition of extracellular vesicles.

The complexity of regulatory networks increases throughout the phylogenetic tree, reaching a high level of complexity in mammalians. Multiple H2O2 sensors and pathways are triggered converging in the regulation of transcription factors at several levels: (1) synthesis of the transcription factor by upregulating transcription or increasing both mRNA stability and translation; (ii) stability of the transcription factor by decreasing its association with the ubiquitin E3 ligase complex or by inhibiting this complex; (iii) cytoplasm\u2013nuclear traffic by exposing/masking nuclear localization signals, or by releasing the transcription factor from partners or from membrane anchors; and (iv) DNA binding and nuclear transactivation by modulating transcription factor affinity towards DNA, co-activators or repressors, and by targeting specific regions of chromatin to activate individual genes. We also discuss how H2O2 biological specificity results from diverse thiol protein sensors, with different reactivity of their sulfhydryl groups towards H2O2, being activated by different concentrations and times of exposure to H2O2. The specific regulation of local H2O2 concentrations is also crucial and results from H2O2 localized production and removal controlled by signals. Finally, we formulate equations to extract from typical experiments quantitative data concerning H2O2 reactivity with sensor molecules.

     "abstract": "Reductions in the blood supply produce considerable injury if the duration of ischemia is prolonged. Paradoxically, restoration of perfusion to ischemic organs can exacerbate tissue damage and extend the size of an evolving infarct. Being highly metabolic organs, the heart and brain are particularly vulnerable to the deleterious effects of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). While the pathogenetic mechanisms contributing to I/R-induced tissue injury and infarction are multifactorial, the relative importance of each contributing factor remains unclear. However, an emerging body of evidence indicates that the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria plays a critical role in damaging cellular components and initiating cell death. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the mechanisms whereby mitochondrial ROS generation occurs in I/R and contributes to myocardial infarction and stroke. In addition, mitochondrial ROS have been shown to participate in preconditioning by several pharmacologic agents that target potassium channels (e.g., ATP-sensitive potassium (mKATP) channels or large conductance, calcium-activated potassium (mBKCa) channels) to activate cell survival programs that render tissues and organs more resistant to the deleterious effects of I/R. Finally, we review novel therapeutic approaches that selectively target mROS production to reduce postischemic tissue injury, which may prove efficacious in limiting myocardial dysfunction and infarction and abrogating neurocognitive deficits and neuronal cell death in stroke.",

     "abstract": "Mitophagy (mitochondrial autophagy), which removes damaged, effete and superfluous mitochondria, has several distinct variants. In Type 1 mitophagy occurring during nutrient deprivation, preautophagic structures (PAS) grow into cup-shaped phagophores that surround and sequester individual mitochondria into mitophagosomes, a process requiring phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) and often occurring in coordination with mitochondrial fission. After sequestration, the outer compartment of the mitophagosome acidifies, followed by mitochondrial depolarization and ultimately hydrolytic digestion in lysosomes. Mitochondrial damage stimulates Type 2 mitophagy. After photodamage to single mitochondria, depolarization occurs followed by decoration and then coalescence of autophagic LC3-containing structures on mitochondrial surfaces. Vesicular acidification then occurs. By contrast to Type 1 mitophagy, PI3K inhibition does not block Type 2 mitophagy. Further, Type 2 mitophagy is not associated with phagophore formation or mitochondrial fission. A third form of self-eating of mitochondria is formation of mitochondria-derived vesicles (MDVs) enriched in oxidized mitochondrial proteins that bud off and transit into multivesicular bodies. Topologically, the internalization of MDV by invagination of the surface of multivesicular bodies followed by vesicle scission into the lumen is a form of microautophagy, or micromitophagy (Type 3 mitophagy). Cell biological distinctions are the basis for these three types of mitophagy. Future studies are needed to better characterize the molecular and biochemical differences between Types 1, 2 and 3 mitophagy.",

Wine\u05f3s beneficial effect has been attributed principally to its non-alcoholic portion, which has antioxidant properties, and contains a wide variety of phenolics, generally called polyphenols. Wine phenolics may prevent or delay the progression of intestinal diseases characterized by oxidative stress and inflammation, especially because they reach higher concentrations in the gut than in other tissues. They act as both free radical scavengers and modulators of specific inflammation-related genes involved in cellular redox signaling. In addition, the importance of wine polyphenols has recently been stressed for their ability to act as prebiotics and antimicrobial agents.Wine components have been proposed as an alternative natural approach to prevent or treat inflammatory bowel diseases. The difficulty remains to distinguish whether these positive properties are due only to polyphenols in wine or also to the alcohol intake, since many studies have reported ethanol to possess various beneficial effects. Our knowledge of the use of wine components in managing human intestinal inflammatory diseases is still quite limited, and further clinical studies may afford more solid evidence of their beneficial effects.",

The damage is also caused by direct ionization of biomolecules. The type of radiation injuries is dependent on the absorbed radiation dose. Sub-lethal IR dose produces more of DNA base damages, whereas higher doses produce more DNA single strand break (SSBs), and double strand breaks (DSBs). The Nrf2-ARE pathway is an important oxidative stress regulating pathway. The DNA DSBs repair regulated by MRN complex, immunomodulation and inflammation regulated by HMGB1 and various types of cytokines are some of the key pathways which interact with each other in a complex manner and modify the radiation response. Because the majority of radiation damage is via oxidative stress, it is essential to gain in depth understanding of the mechanisms of Nrf2-ARE pathway and understand its interactions with MRN complex, HMGB1 and cytokines to increase our understanding on the radiation responses. Such information is of tremendous help in development of medical radiation countermeasures, radioprotective drugs and therapeutics.

In addition, mitochondria play a key role in cell signaling through production of reactive oxygen species that modulate redox signaling. Recent findings support an additional mechanism for control of cellular and tissue function by mitochondria through complex mitochondrial\u2013nuclear communication mechanisms and potentially through extracellular release of mitochondrial components that can act as signaling molecules. The activation of stress responses including mitophagy, mitochondrial number, fission and fusion events, and the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRMT) requires mitochondrial\u2013nuclear communication for the transcriptional activation of nuclear genes involved in mitochondrial quality control and metabolism. The induction of these signaling pathways is a shared feature in long-lived organisms spanning from yeast to mice. As a result, the role of mitochondrial stress signaling in longevity has been expansively studied. Current and exciting studies provide evidence that mitochondria can also signal among tissues to up-regulate cytoprotective activities to promote healthy aging. Alternatively, mitochondria release signals to modulate innate immunity and systemic inflammatory responses and could consequently promote inflammation during aging. In this review, established and emerging models of mitochondrial stress response pathways and their potential role in modulating longevity are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells, relative to normal cells, demonstrate significant alterations in metabolism that are proposed to result in increased steady-state levels of mitochondrial-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as O2\u2022\u2212and H2O2. It has also been proposed that cancer cells increase glucose and hydroperoxide metabolism to compensate for increased levels of ROS. Given this theoretical construct, it is reasonable to propose that forcing cancer cells to use mitochondrial oxidative metabolism by feeding ketogenic diets that are high in fats and low in glucose and other carbohydrates, would selectively cause metabolic oxidative stress in cancer versus normal cells. Increased metabolic oxidative stress in cancer cells would in turn be predicted to selectively sensitize cancer cells to conventional radiation and chemotherapies. This review summarizes the evidence supporting the hypothesis that ketogenic diets may be safely used as an adjuvant therapy to conventional radiation and chemotherapies and discusses the proposed mechanisms by which ketogenic diets may enhance cancer cell therapeutic responses.",

Here in this review, I term this moderate level of oxidative stress as positive oxidative stress, which usually involves imprinting molecular signatures on lipids and proteins via formation of lipid peroxidation by-products and protein oxidation adducts. As ROS/RNS are short-lived molecules, these molecular signatures can thus execute the ultimate function of ROS/RNS.

However, treatment of cells with EGCG results in production of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals in the presence of Fe (III). Thus, EGCG functions as a pro-oxidant in some cellular contexts. Recent investigations have revealed many other direct actions of EGCG that are independent from anti-oxidative mechanisms. In this review, we discuss these novel molecular mechanisms of action for EGCG.

In this paper, we focus on how free radicals and\u00a0related chemical\u00a0species generated in inflammatory environments modulate the antigenicity of self-proteins, resulting in immune responses which involve the generation of autoantibodies against key autoantigens in autoimmune diseases. As examples, we will focus on Ro-60 and C1q in systemic lupus erythematosus, along with\u00a0type-II collagen in rheumatoid arthritis. This review also covers some of the emerging literature which demonstrates that neo-epitopes generated by oxidation are conserved, as exemplified by the evolutionarily conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs).

However, standard culture techniques maintain mammalian cells in vitro under an artificial physicochemical environment such as ambient air and 5% CO2. Oxidative stress is caused by the rapid oxidation of cysteine to cystine in culture media catalyzed by transition metals, leading to diminished intracellular cysteine and glutathione (GSH) pools. Some cells, such as fibroblasts and macrophages, express cystine transport activity, designated as system x c \u2212 , which enables cells to maintain these pools to counteract oxidative stress. Additionally, many cells have the ability to activate the redox sensitive transcription factor Nrf2, a master regulator of cellular defenses against oxidative stress, and to upregulate xCT, the subunit of the x c \u2212 transport system leading to increases in cellular GSH. In contrast, some cells, including lymphoid cells, embryonic stem cells and iPS cells, express relatively low levels of xCT and cannot maintain cellular cysteine and GSH pools. Thus, fibroblasts have been used as feeder cells for the latter cell types based on their ability to supply cysteine. Other key Nrf2 regulated gene products include heme oxygenase 1, peroxiredoxin 1 and sequestosome1. In macrophages, oxidized LDL activates Nrf2 and upregulates the scavenger receptor CD36 forming a positive feedback loop to facilitate removal of the oxidant from the vascular microenvironment. This review describes cell type specific responses to oxygen derived stress, and the key roles that activation of Nrf2 and membrane transport of cystine and cysteine play in the maintenance and proliferation of mammalian cells in culture.",

     "abstract": "According to the CDC, the most common type of heart disease is coronary artery disease, which commonly leads to myocardial infarction (MI). Therapeutic approaches to lessen the resulting cardiovascular injury associated with MI are limited. Recently, MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to act as negative regulators of gene expression by inhibiting mRNA translation and/or stimulating mRNA degradation. A single miRNA can modulate physiological or disease phenotypes by regulating whole functional systems. Importantly, miRNAs can regulate cardiac function, thereby modulating heart muscle contraction, heart growth and morphogenesis. MicroRNA-499 (miRNA-499) is a cardiac-specific miRNA that when elevated causes cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, in turn preventing cardiac dysfunction during MI. Previous studies revealed that combination treatment with conjugated linoleic acid (cLA) and nitrite preserved cardiovascular function in mice. Therefore, it was hypothesized that cLA and nitrite may regulate miRNA-499, thus providing cardiac protection during MI. To test this hypothesis, 12-week old mice were treated with cLA (10\u00a0mg/kg/d-via osmotic mini-pump) or cLA and nitrite (50\u00a0ppm-drinking water) 3 days prior to MI (ligation of the left anterior descending artery). Echocardiography and pressure\u2013volume (PV)-loop analysis revealed that cLA and nitrite-treated MI mice had improved heart function (10 days following MI) compared to untreated MI mice. Treatment with cLA and nitrite significantly induced levels of miRNA-499 compared to untreated MI mice. In addition, treatment with cLA and nitrite abolished MI-induced protein expression of p53 and dynamin-related protein-1 (DRP-1). Moreover, the antioxidant enzyme expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was elevated in MI mice treated with cLA and nitrite compared to untreated MI mice. Confocal imaging on heart tissue confirmed expression the levels of HO-1 and p53. Taken together, these results suggest that therapeutic treatment with cLA and nitrite may provide significant protection during MI through regulation of both cardiac specific miRNA-499 and upregulation of phase 2 antioxidant enzyme expression.",

AngII intra-neuronal signaling is mediated, at least in part, by reactive oxygen species, particularly superoxide (O2\u2212). Recently, it has been discovered that mitochondria are a major subcellular source of AngII-induced O2\u2212. We have previously reported that over-expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial matrix-localized O2\u2212 scavenging enzyme, inhibits AngII intra-neuronal signaling. Interestingly, over-expression of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD), which is believed to be primarily localized to the cytoplasm, similarly inhibits AngII intra-neuronal signaling and provides protection against AngII-mediated neurogenic hypertension. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that CuZnSOD over-expression in central neurons localizes to mitochondria and inhibits AngII intra-neuronal signaling by scavenging mitochondrial O2\u2212. Using a neuronal cell culture model (CATH.a neurons), we demonstrate that both endogenous and adenovirus-mediated over-expressed CuZnSOD (AdCuZnSOD) are present in mitochondria. Furthermore, we show that over-expression of CuZnSOD attenuates the AngII-mediated increase in mitochondrial O2\u2212 levels and the AngII-induced inhibition of neuronal potassium current. Taken together, these data clearly show that over-expressed CuZnSOD in neurons localizes in mitochondria, scavenges AngII-induced mitochondrial O2\u2212, and inhibits AngII intra-neuronal signaling.",

Treatment of Schwann cells with EPS caused a dramatic increase in intracellular GSH levels.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key transcription factor that plays a central role in regulating the expression of \u03b3-GCS. ELISA revealed that EPS increased nuclear Nrf2 levels. Knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA suppressed the EPS-induced GSH biosynthesis. Furthermore, pretreatment with EPS reduced the cytotoxicity induced by H2O2, tert-butylhydroperoxide, 2,2'-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride, and menadione, indicating that EPS plays a role in protecting against oxidative stress.

Two cancer treatments where labile iron may contribute to their mechanism of action are pharmacological ascorbate and ionizing radiation (IR). Pharmacological ascorbate has been shown to have tumor-specific toxic effects due to the formation of hydrogen peroxide. By catalyzing the oxidation of ascorbate, labile iron can enhance the rate of formation of hydrogen peroxide; labile iron can also react with hydrogen peroxide. Here we have investigated the magnitude of the labile iron pool in tumor and normal tissue. We also examined the ability of pharmacological ascorbate and IR to change the size of the labile iron pool. Although a significant amount of labile iron was seen in tumors (MIA PaCa-2 cells in athymic nude mice), higher levels were seen in murine tissues that were not susceptible to pharmacological ascorbate. Pharmacological ascorbate and irradiation were shown to increase the labile iron in tumor homogenates from this murine model of pancreatic cancer. As both IR and pharmacological ascorbate may rely on labile iron for their effects on tumor tissues, our data suggest that pharmacological ascorbate could be used as a radio-sensitizing agent for some radio-resistant tumors.",

In this study, we evaluated adaptive responses induced by brain-specific oxysterol 24SOHC in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Cells treated with 24SOHC at sub-lethal concentrations showed significant reduction in cell death induced by subsequent treatment with 7-ketocholesterol (7KC) in both undifferentiated and retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. These adaptive responses were also induced by other oxysterols such as 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol which are known to be ligands of liver X receptor (LXR). Co-treatment of 24SOHC with 9-cis retinoic acid, a retinoid X receptor ligand, enhanced the adaptive responses. Knockdown of LXR\u03b2 by siRNA diminished the adaptive responses induced by 24SOHC almost completely. The treatment with 24SOHC induced the expression of LXR target genes, such as ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and G1 (ABCG1). The 24SOHC-induced adaptive responses were significantly attenuated by siRNA for ABCG1 but not by siRNA for ABCA1. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that 24SOHC at sub-lethal concentrations induces adaptive responses via transcriptional activation of LXR signaling pathway, thereby protecting neuronal cells from subsequent 7KC-induced cytotoxicity.",

Oxidative stress is an important mediator of inflammatory repair. The androgen metabolite 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is an effective biomarker of oxidative stress and healing.6 Cell-lines of HGF and HPF established in confluent monolayer culture were incubated in Eagle's MEM using 14C-testosterone and 14C-4-androstendione as substrate; in conjunction with effective concentrations of N, G and H2O2 established at N250, G3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 3%H2O2 w/w, 0.5\u00a0\u03bcl/ml. Combinations of H2O2G and H2O2GN were used in order to compare the oxidative effects of N/H2O2 and their responses to glutathione. At 24\u00a0h, the medium was solvent extracted, evaporated to dryness and subjected to TLC in a benzene/acetone solvent system 4:1 v/v for the separation of metabolites. The separated metabolites were quantified using a radioisotope scanner.The mean trends of 6 cell-lines for both substrates and each cell type demonstrated that the yield of the main metabolite DHT was significantly reduced by N and H2O2 alone (2-fold, n=6; p<0.01). The inhibition caused by H2O2 was overcome by the antioxidant glutathione in the combination H2O2G, to values similar to those of controls (n=6; p<0.01). It is relevant that when N was added to this neutralized combination, the decrease in yields of DHT triggered by N were comparable to those induced by H2O2; and retaining the positive effect of G.Oxidative stress mediated by H2O2 was overcome by glutathione and recurred when nicotine was added, suggestive of a pro- oxidant role for nicotine.

     "abstract": "Ozone (O3) is a serious public health concern. Recent findings indicate that the damaging health effects of O3 extend to multiple systemic organ systems. Herein, we hypothesize that O3 inhalation will cause downstream alterations to the liver. To test this, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to 0.5\u00a0ppm O3 for 8\u00a0h/day for 5 days. Plasma liver enzyme measurements showed that 5 day O3 exposure did not cause liver cell death. Proteomic and mass spectrometry analysis identified 10 proteins in the liver that were significantly altered in abundance following short-term O3 exposure and these included several stress responsive proteins. Glucose-regulated protein 78 and protein disulfide isomerase increased, whereas glutathione S-transferase M1 was significantly decreased by O3 inhalation. In contrast, no significant changes were detected for the stress response protein heme oxygenase-1 or cytochrome P450 2E1 and 2B in liver of O3 exposed rats compared to controls. In summary, these results show that an environmentally-relevant exposure to inhaled O3 can alter the expression of select proteins in the liver. We propose that O3 inhalation may represent an important unrecognized factor that can modulate hepatic metabolic functions.",

     "abstract": "Abnormal vascular responsiveness in diabetes has been attributed to a number of changes in contractile pathways, affected in part by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It has been reported that NADPH oxidase (NOX) is increased in diabetic (streptozotocin treated; STZ) rat arteries; however the pharmacological agents used to inhibit NOX activity are known to be unsuitable for in vitro studies and have a high level of non-selectivity. Here we have used the highly selective NOX inhibitor VAS2870 in diabetic rat aorta and compared its effects with apocynin, SOD, and allopurinol on phenylephrine and U46619 induced contraction.Male Wistar rats were injected intraperitoneally with 65\u00a0mg/kg STZ and development of diabetes was confirmed by testing blood glucose levels. Rats were killed by CO2 asphyxiation, and the thoracic aorta removed and mounted in an organ bath under a tension of 1\u00a0g. Diabetic rat aortas exhibit a greatly increased response to phenylephrine, which was reduced to a level consistent with control rat aorta by 10\u22125\u00a0M VAS2870 and 150\u00a0U/ml SOD. Incubation with VAS2870 led to an increase in normal rat aorta contraction, but led to a significant reduction in phenylephrine and U46619 induced tone in diabetic rat aorta, which indicates that ROS in diabetic rats directly contributes to these contractile responses. Apocynin and allopurinol had no effect on contraction in diabetic or normal rat aorta. This data is the first to show that selective inhibition of NOX reduces diabetic arterial contraction in direct comparison with inhibition of other known contributors of ROS.",

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the impact of EMRT on oxidative stress biomarkers induced in old people (70\u201375 years) by a single bout of acute, intense exercise. Sixteen subjects randomly assigned to either a control, not exercising group (n=8) or a trained group performing EMRT protocol for 12-weeks (n=8), were submitted to a graded maximal exercise stress test (GXT) at baseline and after the 12-weeks of EMRT protocol, with blood samples collected before, immediately after, 1 and 24\u00a0h post-GXT test. Blood glutathione (GSH, GSSG, GSH/GSSG), plasma malonaldehyde (MDA), protein carbonyls and creatine kinase (CK) levels, as well as PBMCs cellular damage (Comet assay, apoptosis) and stress\u2013protein response (Hsp70 and Hsp27 expression) were evaluated. The use of multiple biomarkers allowed us to confirm that EMRT per se neither affected redox homeostasis nor induced any cellular and oxidative damage. Following the GXT, the EMRT group displayed a higher GSH/GSSG ratio and a less pronounced increase in MDA, protein carbonyls and CK levels compared to control group. Moreover, we found that Hsp70 and Hsp27 proteins were induced after GXT only in EMRT group, while any significant modification within 24\u00a0h was detected in untrained group. Apoptosis rates and DNA damage did not show any significant variation in relation to EMRT and/or GXT.In conclusion, the adherence to an EMRT protocol is able to induce a cellular adaptation allowing healthy elderly trained subjects to cope with the oxidative stress induced by an acute exercise more effectively than the aged-matched sedentary subjects.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the preventive and therapeutic effects of nitrate and nitrite in a model of experimental colitis.Colitis was induced in mice by administrating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) with concurrent administration of nitrite (1\u00a0mM) or nitrate (10\u00a0mM) in the drinking water for 7 days. A therapeutic approach was also investigated by initiating nitrite treatment 3 days after DSS-induced colitis. Clinical and inflammatory markers were assessed and the colonic mucus thickness was measured in vivo. The effect of nitrite on wound healing was evaluated using colon epithelial cells.Concurrent administration of DSS and nitrite (1\u00a0mM) alleviated inflammation as determined by reduced disease activity index score (DAI) and increased colon length, while nitrate (10\u00a0mM) only reduced the DAI-score. Nitrite also displayed therapeutic effects by ameliorating established colonic inflammation with reduced colonic expression of iNOS and improving histopathology. DSS-induced decrease in colonic mucus thickness was completely prevented by nitrite administration. In addition, goblet cell abundance was lower by DSS treatment, but was increased by addition of nitrite. Further studies using colon epithelial cells revealed an NO-dependent improvement in wound healing with nitrite administration.Nitrite exerts both preventive and therapeutic effects in colonic inflammation. The protective effects involve preservation of an intact adherent mucus layer and regulation of epithelial cell restitution.",

The results showed that both singlet oxygen (O2\u22121) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) content increased in CO, NOx and SO2 treated strawberry leaves. A drastic reduction of primary metabolism of plants (photosynthesis), with the closure of stomata, resulted in a reduction of protein, carbohydrate and sucrose content due to production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under prolonged exposure of gas stress. The resulting antioxidant enzymes were increased under a low dose of gas stress, whereas they were decreased due to a high dose of gas stress. Our results indicate that increased ROS may act as a signal to induce defense responses to CO, NOx and SO2 gas stress. The increased level of antioxidant enzymes plays a significant role in plant protection due to which strawberry plants can be used as a hyperaccumulator to maintain environmental pollution, however, the defense capacity cannot sufficiently alleviate oxidative damage under prolonged exposure of CO, NOx and SO2 stress.",

A solid phase extraction method was developed to separate the analyte classes, using a mixed mode cartridge (reverse phase, \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 bonding, strong anion exchange), then \u03b1-tocopherol and cholesterol were measured using standard techniques, while the fatty acids were quantitated using a novel, reverse phase liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) approach. We also determined if \u03b1-tocopherol status alters embryonic lipid peroxidation products by analyzing 24 different oxidized products of arachidonic or docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids in embryos using LC with hybrid quadrupole-time of flight MS. Adult zebrafish were fed E\u2212 or E+ diets for 4 months, and then were spawned to obtain E\u2212 and E+ embryos.

At 36\u00a0hpf, E\u2212 embryos contained double the 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids and 7-hydroxy-DHA concentrations, while other hydroxy-lipids remained unchanged.

A contribution of NADPH oxidase to reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation after cell exposure to micromolar concentrations of hIAPP aggregates has been suggested. However, little is known about \u03b2-cells exposure to lower amounts of hIAPP aggregates, similar to those found in human pancreas. Thus, we aimed to investigate the events resulting from RIN-5F cells exposure to nanomolar concentrations of toxic hIAPP aggregates. We found an early and transient rise of NADPH oxidase activity resulting from increased Nox1 expression following the engagement of receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) by hIAPP aggregates. Unexpectedly, NADPH oxidase activation was not accompanied by a significant ROS increase and the lipoperoxidation level was significantly reduced. Indeed, cell exposure to hIAPP aggregates affected the antioxidant defences, inducing a significant increase of the expression and activity of catalase and glutathione peroxidase. We conclude that exposure of pancreatic \u03b2-cells to nanomolar concentrations of hIAPP aggregates for a short time induces an hormetic response via the RAGE-Nox1 axis; the latter stimulates the enzymatic antioxidant defences that preserve the cells against oxidative stress damage.",

This study aimed at testing the hypothesis that circulating levels of the lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal bound to thiol proteins (4HNE-P) are strongly associated with those of its potential precursors, namely n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).Circulating levels of 4HNE-P were evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 71 control subjects and 61 ambulatory symptomatic HF patients along with various other clinically- and biochemically-relevant parameters, including other oxidative stress markers, and total levels of fatty acids from all classes, which reflect both free and bound to cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides. All HF patients had severe systolic functional impairment despite receiving optimal evidence-based therapies. Compared to controls, HF patients displayed markedly lower circulating levels of HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, which are major PUFA carriers, as well as of PUFA of the n-6 series, specifically linoleic acid (LA; P=0.001). Circulating 4HNE-P in HF patients was similar to controls, albeit multiple regression analysis revealed that LA was the only factor that was significantly associated with circulating 4HNE-P in the entire population (R2=0.086; P=0.02). In HF patients only, 4HNE-P was even more strongly associated with LA (P=0.003) and HDL-cholesterol (p<0.0002). Our results demonstrate that 4HNE-P levels, expressed relative to HDL-cholesterol, increase as HDL-cholesterol plasma levels decrease in the HF group only.Results from this study emphasize the importance of considering changes in lipids and lipoproteins in the interpretation of measurements of lipid peroxidation products. Further studies appear warranted to explore the possibility that HDL-cholesterol particles may be a carrier of 4HNE adducts.",

Due to its high sensitivity to oxidants this cluster is responsible for eNOS dimer destabilization during periods of redox stress. In this work we utilized site directed mutagenesis to replace the redox sensitive cysteine residues in the ZnS4 cluster with redox stable tetra-arginines. Our data indicate that this C94R/C99R eNOS mutant is active. In addition, this mutant protein is insensitive to dimer disruption and inhibition when challenged with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Further, the overexpression of the C94R/C99R mutant preserved the angiogenic response in endothelial cells challenged with H2O2. The over-expression of the C94R/C99R mutant preserved the ability of endothelial cells to migrate towards vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and preserved the endothelial monolayer in a scratch wound assay.

Using a pharmacological inhibitor specific for Nox1, 2-acetylphenothiazine (ML171), and Nox2 deficient mice, we show that Nox1 is the key Nox homolog regulating GPVI-dependent ROS production. Nox1, but not Nox2, was essential for CRP-dependent thromboxane (Tx)A2 production, which was mediated in part through p38 MAPK signaling; while neither Nox1 nor Nox2 was significantly involved in regulating CRP-induced platelet aggregation/integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation, platelet spreading, or dense granule and \u03b1-granule release (ATP release and P-selectin surface expression, respectively). Ex-vivo perfusion analysis of mouse whole blood revealed that both Nox1 and Nox2 were involved in collagen-mediated thrombus formation at arterial shear.Together these results demonstrate a novel role for Nox1 in regulating GPVI-induced ROS production, which is essential for optimal p38 activation and subsequent TxA2 production, providing an explanation for reduced thrombus formation following Nox1 inhibition.",

In our preliminary data, GlxI was identified as a substrate of transglutaminase 2 (TG2), a ubiquitous enzyme with multiple functions. According to the catalytic properties of TG2, protein cross-linking, polyamine conjugation, and/or deamidation are potential post-translational modifications. In this article, we have demonstrated that TG2 catalyzes either polyamine conjugation or deamidation to GlxI depending on the presence of polyamines or not. Deamidation leads to activation of GlxI while polyamine conjugation results in activation of GlxI as well as stabilization of GlxI against denaturation treatment. In cultured HeLa cells, methylglyoxal challenge causes increase in intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and calcium leading to TG2 activation and subsequent transamidation and activation of GlxI. The inhibition of TG2 significantly weakens the cell resistance to the methylglyoxal challenge. Thus, GlxI is a novel substrate of TG2 and is activated by TG2 in vitro and in cellulo. Exposure to methylglyoxal elicits a negative feedback loop entailing ROS, calcium, TG2 and GlxI, thus leading to attenuation of the increase in the methylglyoxal level. The results imply that cancer cells highly express TG2 or GlxI can endure the oxidative stress derived from higher glycolytic flux and may gain extra growth advantage from the aerobic glycolysis.",

These include conversion of the biconcave disc morphology to a spherical one, decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, varied mean corpuscular volume, reduced integrity of the erythrocyte membrane with formation of microparticles, and increased cell-free hemoglobin. We studied the extent that older stored red blood cells scavenge nitric oxide (NO) faster than fresher stored red blood cells. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and stopped-flow absorption spectroscopy to measure the rate of NO uptake and reaction with hemoglobin in red cells, we found that older stored red blood cells scavenge NO about 1.8 times faster than fresher ones. Based on these experimental data, we simulated NO scavenging by fresher or older stored red blood cells with a biconcave or spherical geometry, respectively, in order to explore the mechanism of NO scavenging related to changes that occur during blood storage. We found that red blood cells with a spherical geometry scavenges NO about 2 times slower than ones with a biconcave geometry, and a smaller RBC hemoglobin concentration or volume increases NO scavenging by red blood cells. Our simulations demonstrate that even the most extreme possible changes in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and mean corpuscular volume that favor increased NO scavenging are insufficient to account for what is observed experimentally. Therefore, RBC membrane permeability must increase during storage and we find that the permeability is likely to increase between 5 and 70 fold. Simulations using a two-dimensional blood vessel show that even a 5-fold increase in membrane permeability to NO can reduce NO bioavailability at the smooth muscle.Transfusion of older stored blood may be harmful.Older stored red blood cells scavenge nitric oxide more than fresher cells.As stored red blood cells age, structural and biochemical changes occur that lead to faster scavenging.Increased nitric oxide scavenging by red blood cells as a function of storage age contributes to deleterious effects upon transfusion.",

     "abstract": "Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is a mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme that is down-regulated in a majority of cancers. Due to this observation, as well as MnSOD\u2032s potent antioxidant enzymatic activity, MnSOD has been suggested as a tumor suppressor for over 30 years. However, testing this postulate has proven difficult due to the early post-natal lethality of the MnSOD constitutive knock-out mouse. We have previously used a conditional tissue-specific MnSOD knock-out mouse to study the effects of MnSOD loss on the development of various cell types, but long-term cancer development studies have not been performed. We hypothesized the complete loss of MnSOD would significantly increase the rate of tumor formation in a tissue-specific manner.Utilizing a hematopoietic stem cell specific Cre-recombinase mouse model, we created pan-hematopoietic cell MnSOD knock-out mice. Additionally, we combined this MnSOD knock-out with two well established models of lymphoma development: B-lymphocyte specific Myc over-expression and conditional pan-hematopoietic cell p53 knock-out. Mice were allowed to age unchallenged until illness or death had occurred. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the loss of MnSOD alone was insufficient in causing an increase in tumor formation, but did cause significant life-shortening skin pathology in a strain-dependent manner. Moreover, the loss of MnSOD in conjunction with either Myc overexpression or p53 knock-out did not accelerate tumor formation, and in fact delayed lymphomagenesis in the p53 knock-out model.Our findings strongly suggest that MnSOD does not act as a classical tumor suppressor in hematological tissues. Additionally, the complete loss of MnSOD may actually protect from tumor development by the creation of an unfavorable redox environment for tumor progression. In summary, these results in combination with our previous work suggest that MnSOD needs to be tightly regulated for proper cellular homeostasis, and altering the activity in either direction may lead to cellular dysfunction, oncogenesis, or death.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial toxicity is increasingly being implicated as a contributing factor to many xenobiotic-induced organ toxicities, including skeletal muscle toxicity. This has necessitated the need for predictive in vitro models that are able to sensitively detect mitochondrial toxicity of chemical entities early in the research and development process. One such cell model involves substituting galactose for glucose in the culture media. Since cells cultured in galactose are unable to generate sufficient ATP from glycolysis they are forced to rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation for ATP generation and consequently are more sensitive to mitochondrial perturbation than cells grown in glucose. The aim of this study was to characterise cellular growth, bioenergetics and mitochondrial toxicity of the L6 rat skeletal muscle cell line cultured in either high glucose or galactose media. L6 myoblasts proliferated more slowly when cultured in galactose media, although they maintained similar levels of ATP. Galactose cultured L6 cells were significantly more sensitive to classical mitochondrial toxicants than glucose-cultured cells, confirming the cells had adapted to galactose media. Analysis of bioenergetic function with the XF Seahorse extracellular flux analyser demonstrated that oxygen consumption rate (OCR) was significantly increased whereas extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), a measure of glycolysis, was decreased in cells grown in galactose. Mitochondria operated closer to state 3 respiration and had a lower mitochondrial membrane potential and basal mitochondrial O2\u2013 level compared to cells in the glucose model. An antimycin A (AA) dose response revealed that there was no difference in the sensitivity of OCR to AA inhibition between glucose and galactose cells.

     "abstract": "Sulfide salts are known to promote the release of nitric oxide (NO) from S-nitrosothiols and potentiate their vasorelaxant activity, but much of the cross-talk between hydrogen sulfide and NO is believed to occur via functional interactions of cell regulatory elements such as phosphodiesterases. Using RFL-6 cells as an NO reporter system we sought to investigate whether sulfide can also modulate nitrosothiol-mediated soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activation following direct chemical interaction. We find a U-shaped dose response relationship where low sulfide concentrations attenuate sGC stimulation by S-nitrosopenicillamine (SNAP) and cyclic GMP levels are restored at equimolar ratios. Similar results are observed when intracellular sulfide levels are raised by pre-incubation with the sulfide donor, GYY4137. The outcome of direct sulfide/nitrosothiol interactions also critically depends on molar reactant ratios and is accompanied by oxygen consumption. With sulfide in excess, a \u2018yellow compound\u2019 accumulates that is indistinguishable from the product of solid-phase transnitrosation of either hydrosulfide or hydrodisulfide and assigned to be nitrosopersulfide (perthionitrite, SSNO\u2212; \u03bbmax 412\u00a0nm in aqueous buffers, pH 7.4; 448\u00a0nm in DMF). Time-resolved chemiluminescence and UV\u2013visible spectroscopy analyses suggest that its generation is preceded by formation of the short-lived NO-donor, thionitrite (SNO\u2212). In contrast to the latter, SSNO\u2212 is rather stable at physiological pH and generates both NO and polysulfides on decomposition, resulting in sustained potentiation of SNAP-induced sGC stimulation. Thus, sulfide reacts with nitrosothiols to form multiple bioactive products; SSNO\u2212 rather than SNO\u2212 may account for some of the longer-lived effects of nitrosothiols and contribute to sulfide and NO signaling.",

     "abstract": "Shifts in intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) have been shown to contribute to carcinogenesis and to tumor progression. In addition to DNA and cell damage by surges in ROS, sub-lethal increases in ROS are implicated in regulating cellular signaling that enhances pro-metastatic behavior. We previously showed that subtle increases in endogenous H2O2 regulate migratory and invasive behavior of metastatic bladder cancer cells through phosphatase inhibition and consequential phosphorylation of p130cas, an adapter of the FAK signaling pathway. We further showed that enhanced redox status contributed to enhanced localization of p130cas to the membrane of metastatic cells. Here we show that this signaling complex can similarly be induced in a redox-engineered cell culture model that enables regulation of intracellular steady state H2O2 level by enforced expression of superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) and catalase. Expression of Sod2 leads to enhanced p130cas phosphorylation in HT-1080 fibrosarcoma and UM-UC-6 bladder cancer cells. These changes are mediated by H2O2, as co-expression of Catalase abrogates p130cas phosphorylation and its interaction with the adapter protein Crk. Importantly, we establish that the redox environment influence the localization of the tumor suppressor and phosphatase PTEN, in both redox-engineered and metastatic bladder cancer cells that display endogenous increases in H2O2. Importantly, PTEN oxidation leads to its dissociation from the plasma membrane. This indicates that oxidation of PTEN not only influences its activity, but also regulates its cellular localization, effectively removing it from its primary site of lipid phosphatase activity. These data introduce hitherto unappreciated paradigms whereby ROS can reciprocally regulate the cellular localization of pro- and anti-migratory signaling molecules, p130cas and PTEN, respectively. These data further confirm that altering antioxidant status and the intracellular ROS environment can have profound effects on pro-metastatic signaling pathways.",

The goal of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism by which UA prevents monocyte dysfunction induced by metabolic stress.Metabolic stress sensitizes or \u201cprimes\u201d human THP-1 monocytes and murine peritoneal macrophages to the chemoattractant MCP-1, converting these cells into a hyper-chemotactic phenotype. UA protected THP-1 monocytes and peritoneal macrophages against metabolic priming and prevented their hyper-reactivity to MCP-1. UA blocked the metabolic stress-induced increase in global protein-S-glutathionylation, a measure of cellular thiol oxidative stress, and normalized actin-S-glutathionylation. UA also restored MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP1) protein expression and phosphatase activity, decreased by metabolic priming, and normalized p38 MAPK activation. Neither metabolic stress nor UA supplementation altered mRNA or protein levels of glutaredoxin-1, the principal enzyme responsible for the reduction of mixed disulfides between glutathione and protein thiols in these cells. However, the induction of Nox4 by metabolic stress, required for metabolic priming, was inhibited by UA in both THP-1 monocytes and peritoneal macrophages.UA protects THP-1 monocytes against dysfunction by suppressing metabolic stress-induced Nox4 expression, thereby preventing the Nox4-dependent dysregulation of redox-sensitive processes, including actin turnover and MAPK-signaling, two key processes that control monocyte migration and adhesion. This study provides a novel mechanism for the anti-inflammatory and athero- and renoprotective properties of UA and suggests that dysfunctional blood monocytes may be primary targets of UA and related compounds.",

In this study we show that induced expression of HO-1 by subjecting macrophage RAW-264.7 cells to chemical or physiological hypoxia resulted in significant translocation of HO-1 protein to mitochondria. Transient transfection of COS-7 cells with cloned cDNA also resulted in mitochondrial translocation of HO-1. Deletion of N-terminal ER targeting domain increased mitochondrial translocation under the transient transfection conditions. Mitochondrial localization of both intact HO-1 and N-terminal truncated HO-1 caused loss of heme aa-3 and cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) activity in COS-7 cells. The truncated protein, which localizes to mitochondria at higher levels, induced substantially steeper loss of CcO activity and reduced heme aa3 content. Furthermore, cells expressing mitochondria targeted HO-1 also induced higher ROS production. Consistent with dysfunctional state of mitochondria induced by HO-1, the mitochondrial recruitment of autophagy markers LC-3 and Drp-1 was also increased in these cells. Chronic ethanol feeding in rats also caused an increase in mitochondrial HO-1 and decrease in CcO activity. These results show that as opposed to the protective effect of the ER associated HO-1, mitochondria targeted HO-1 under normoxic conditions induces mitochondrial dysfunction.",

In this mechanism, exogenously added lithocholic bile acid enters yeast cells, accumulates mainly in the inner mitochondrial membrane, and elicits an age-related remodeling of phospholipid synthesis and movement within both mitochondrial membranes. Such remodeling of mitochondrial phospholipid dynamics progresses with the chronological age of a yeast cell and ultimately causes significant changes in mitochondrial membrane lipidome. These changes in the composition of membrane phospholipids alter mitochondrial abundance and morphology, thereby triggering changes in the age-related chronology of such longevity-defining redox processes as mitochondrial respiration, the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential, the preservation of cellular homeostasis of mitochondrially produced reactive oxygen species, and the coupling of electron transport to ATP synthesis.",

     "abstract": "Catalases are efficient scavengers of H2O2 and protect cells against H2O2 stress. Examination of the H2O2 stimulon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that the cytosolic catalase T (Ctt1) protein level increases 15-fold on H2O2 challenge in synthetic complete media although previous work revealed that deletion of the CCT1 or CTA1 genes (encoding peroxisomal/mitochondrial catalase A) does not increase the H2O2 sensitivity of yeast challenged in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). This we attributed to our observation that catalase activity is depressed when yeast are challenged with H2O2 in nutrient-poor media. Hence, we performed a systematic comparison of catalase activity and cell viability of wild-type yeast and of the single catalase knockouts, ctt1\u2206 and cta1\u2206, following H2O2 challenge in nutrient-rich medium (YPD) and in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Ctt1 but not Cta1 activity is strongly induced by H2O2 when cells are challenged in YPD but suppressed when cells are challenged in buffer. Consistent with the activity results, exponentially growing ctt1\u2206 cells in YPD are more sensitive to H2O2 than wild-type or cta1\u2206 cells, whereas in buffer all three strains exhibit comparable H2O2 hypersensitivity. Furthermore, catalase activity is increased during adaptation to sublethal H2O2 concentrations in YPD but not in buffer. We conclude that induction of cytosolic Ctt1 activity is vital in protecting yeast against exogenous H2O2 but this activity is inhibited by H2O2 when cells are challenged in nutrient-free media.",

     "abstract": "Prolonged exposure to hyperoxia results in acute lung injury (ALI), accompanied by a significant elevation in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and leukocyte infiltration in the lungs. However, the mechanisms underlying hyperoxia-induced proinflammatory ALI remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of the proinflammatory cytokine high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) in hyperoxic inflammatory lung injury, using an adult mouse model. The exposure of C57BL/6 mice to \u226599% O2 (hyperoxia) significantly increased the accumulation of HMGB1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) prior to the onset of severe inflammatory lung injury. In the airways of hyperoxic mice, HMGB1 was hyperacetylated and existed in various redox forms. Intratracheal administration of recombinant HMGB1 (rHMGB1) caused a significant increase in leukocyte infiltration into the lungs compared to animal treated with a non-specific peptide. Neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibodies, administrated before hyperoxia significantly attenuated pulmonary edema and inflammatory responses, as indicated by decreased total protein content, wet/dry weight ratio, and numbers of leukocytes in the airways. This protection was also observed when HMGB1 inhibitors were administered after the onset of the hyperoxic exposure. The aliphatic antioxidant, ethyl pyruvate (EP), inhibited HMGB1 secretion from hyperoxic macrophages and attenuated hyperoxic lung injury. Overall, our data suggest that HMGB1 plays a critical role in mediating hyperoxic ALI through the recruitment of leukocytes into the lungs. If these results can be translated to humans, they suggest that HMGB1 inhibitors provide treatment regimens for oxidative inflammatory lung injury in patients receiving hyperoxia through mechanical ventilation.",

     "abstract": "Superoxide is widely regarded as the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS) which initiates downstream oxidative stress. Increased oxidative stress contributes, in part, to many disease conditions such as cancer, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, diabetes, aging, and neurodegeneration. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into hydrogen peroxide which can then be further detoxified by other antioxidant enzymes. MnSOD is critical in maintaining the normal function of mitochondria, thus its inactivation is thought to lead to compromised mitochondria. Previously, our laboratory observed increased mitochondrial biogenesis in a novel kidney-specific MnSOD knockout mouse. The current study used transient siRNA mediated MnSOD knockdown of normal rat kidney (NRK) cells as the in vitro model, and confirmed functional mitochondrial biogenesis evidenced by increased PGC1\u03b1 expression, mitochondrial DNA copy numbers and integrity, electron transport chain protein CORE II, mitochondrial mass, oxygen consumption rate, and overall ATP production. Further mechanistic studies using mitoquinone (MitoQ), a mitochondria-targeted antioxidant and L-NAME, a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor demonstrated that peroxynitrite (at low micromolar levels) induced mitochondrial biogenesis. These findings provide the first evidence that low levels of peroxynitrite can initiate a protective signaling cascade involving mitochondrial biogenesis which may help to restore mitochondrial function following transient MnSOD inactivation.",

In the present study, we investigated the developmental pattern and effect of VitC deficiency on antioxidants, vitamin E and superoxide dismutase (SOD), assessed oxidative damage by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA), hydroxynonenal (HNE) and nitrotyrosine (NT) and analysed gene and protein expression of apoptosis marker caspase-3 in the guinea pig foetal brain at two gestational (GD) time points, GD 45/pre-term and GD 56/near term following either a VitC sufficient (CTRL) or deficient (DEF) maternal dietary regime. We show that except for SOD, antioxidants and oxidative damage markers are differentially expressed between the two GDs, with high VitC (p<0.0001), NT modified proteins (p<0.0001) and active caspase-3 levels (p<0.05) at pre-term and high vitamin E levels (p<0.0001), HNE (p<0.0001) and MDA (p<0.0001) at near term. VitC deficiency significantly increased SOD activity (p<0.0001) compared to CTRLs at both GDs indicating a compensatory response, however, low levels of VitC significantly elevated MDA levels (p<0.05) in DEF at near term.

Furthermore, we use mice that are either heterozygous (HZ) or null (KO) for glutamate cysteine ligase modifier subunit (Gclm), in order to titrate the toxicity relative to wild-type (WT) mice. Gclm is important for efficient de novo synthesis of glutathione (GSH). APAP (300\u00a0mg/kg, ip) or saline was administered and mice were collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 6, 12, and 24\u00a0h. Male mice showed marked elevation in serum alanine aminotransferase by 6\u00a0h. In contrast, female WT and HZ mice showed minimal toxicity at all time points. Female KO mice, however, showed AILD comparable to male mice. Genotype-matched male and female mice showed comparable APAP\u2013protein adducts, with Gclm KO mice sustaining significantly greater adducts. ATP was depleted in mice showing toxicity, suggesting impaired mitochondria function. Indeed, peroxiredoxin-6, a GSH-dependent peroxiredoxin, was preferentially adducted by APAP in mitochondria of male mice but rarely adducted in female mice. These results support parallel mechanisms of toxicity where APAP adduction of peroxiredoxin-6 and sustained GSH depletion results in the collapse of mitochondria function and hepatocyte death. We conclude that adduction of peroxiredoxin-6 sensitizes male C57BL/6 mice to toxicity by acetaminophen.",

The aim of the present study was to survey the involvement of DUOX1 in cellular redox signaling by protein S-glutathionylation, a major mode of reversible redox signaling. Using human airway epithelial H292 cells and stable transfection with DUOX1-targeted shRNA as well as primary tracheal epithelial cells from either wild-type or DUOX1-deficient mice, DUOX1 was found to be critical in ATP-stimulated transient production of H2O2 and increased protein S-glutathionylation. Using cell pre-labeling with biotin-tagged GSH and analysis of avidin-purified proteins by global proteomics, 61 S-glutathionylated proteins were identified in ATP-stimulated cells compared to 19 in untreated cells. Based on a previously established role of DUOX1 in cell migration, various redox-sensitive proteins with established roles in cytoskeletal dynamics and/or cell migration were evaluated for S-glutathionylation, indicating a critical role for DUOX1 in ATP-stimulated S-glutathionylation of \u03b2-actin, peroxiredoxin 1, the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src, and MAPK phosphatase 1. Overall, our studies demonstrate the importance of DUOX1 in epithelial redox signaling through reversible S-glutathionylation of a range of proteins, including proteins involved in cytoskeletal regulation and MAPK signaling pathways involved in cell migration.",

High glucose may be a risk factor for dementia even among persons without diabetes, and in transgenic animals it has been shown to cause a potentiation of indices that are pre-symptomatic of Alzheimer\u2032s disease. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms linking inflammatory events elicited in the brain during oxidative stress and diabetes, we monitored the activation of mitogen-activated kinsase (MAPKs), c-jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 MAP kinases (p38MAPK), and extracellular activating kinsae1/2 (ERK1/2) and the anti-inflammatory effects of the thioredoxin mimetic (TxM) peptides, Ac-Cys-Pro-Cys-amide (CB3) and Ac-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-amide (CB4) in the brain of male leptin-receptor-deficient Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats and human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Daily i.p. injection of CB3 to ZDF rats inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK and p38MAPK, and prevented the expression of thioredoxin-interacting-protein (TXNIP/TBP-2) in ZDF rat brain. Although plasma glucose/insulin remained high, CB3 also increased the phosphorylation of AMP-ribose activating kinase (AMPK) and inhibited p70S6K kinase in the brain. Both CB3 and CB4 reversed apoptosis induced by inhibiting thioredoxin reductase as monitored by decreasing caspase 3 cleavage and PARP dissociation in SH-SY5Y cells. The decrease in JNK and p38MAPK activity in the absence of a change in plasma glucose implies a decrease in oxidative or neuroinflammatory stress in the ZDF rat brain. CB3 not only attenuated MAPK phosphorylation and activated AMPK in the brain, but it also diminished apoptotic markers, most likely acting via the MAPK\u2013AMPK\u2013mTOR pathway. These results were correlated with CB3 and CB4 inhibiting inflammation progression and protection from oxidative stress induced apoptosis in human neuronal cells. We suggest that by attenuating neuro-inflammatory processes in the brain Trx1 mimetic peptides could become beneficial for preventing neurological disorders associated with diabetes.",

     "abstract": "Reactive species such as free radicals are constantly generated in vivo and DNA is the most important target of oxidative stress. Oxidative DNA damage is used as a predictive biomarker to monitor the risk of development of many diseases. The comet assay is widely used for measuring oxidative DNA damage at a single cell level. The analysis of comet assay output images, however, poses considerable challenges. Commercial software is costly and restrictive, while free software generally requires laborious manual tagging of cells. This paper presents OpenComet, an open-source software tool providing automated analysis of comet assay images. It uses a novel and robust method for finding comets based on geometric shape attributes and segmenting the comet heads through image intensity profile analysis. Due to automation, OpenComet is more accurate, less prone to human bias, and faster than manual analysis. A live analysis functionality also allows users to analyze images captured directly from a microscope. We have validated OpenComet on both alkaline and neutral comet assay images as well as sample images from existing software packages. Our results show that OpenComet achieves high accuracy with significantly reduced analysis time.",

Quadriceps weakness and inflammatory cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of knee OA, and both of which, increase with vitamin D deficiency. Other micronutrients, such as vitamins C and E and \u03b2-carotene, modulate inflammatory cytokines and decrease during inflammation. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency associates with quadriceps weakness, an increase in serum cytokines, and a decrease in circulating micronutrients in subjects with knee OA. Subjects (age, 48\u00b11\u00a0y; serum 25(OH)D, 25.8\u00b11.1\u00a0ng/mL) with knee OA were categorized as vitamin D deficient (n=17; serum 25(OH)D\u226420\u00a0ng/mL), insufficient (n=21; serum 25(OH)D 20\u201329\u00a0ng/mL), or sufficient (n=18; serum 25(OH)D\u226530\u00a0ng/mL).

Quadriceps peak torque, average power, total work, and deceleration were significantly (all p<0.05) impaired with vitamin D deficiency. Serum \u03b3-tocopherol concentrations were significantly (p<0.05) increased with vitamin D deficiency. In the vitamin D sufficient group, \u03b3-tocopherol inversely correlated (r=\u22120.47, p<0.05) with TNF-\u03b1, suggesting a pro-inflammatory increase with a \u03b3-tocopherol decrease despite a sufficient serum 25(OH)D concentration. We conclude that vitamin D deficiency is detrimental to quadriceps function, and in subjects with vitamin D sufficiency, \u03b3-tocopherol could have an important anti-inflammatory role in a pathophysiological condition mediated by inflammation.",

     "abstract": "Thioredoxin reductase (TR) catalyzes the reduction of thioredoxin (TRX), which in turn reduces mammalian typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (PRXs 1\u20134), thiol peroxidases implicated in redox homeostasis and cell signaling. Typical 2-Cys PRXs are inactivated by hyperoxidation of the peroxidatic cysteine to cysteine-sulfinic acid, and regenerated in a two-step process involving retro-reduction by sulfiredoxin (SRX) and reduction by TRX. Here transient exposure to menadione and glucose oxidase was used to examine the dynamics of oxidative inactivation and reactivation of PRXs in mouse C10 cells expressing various isoforms of TR, including wild type cytoplasmic TR1 (Sec-TR1) and mitochondrial TR2 (Sec-TR2) that encode selenocysteine, as well as mutants of TR1 and TR2 in which the selenocysteine codon was changed to encode cysteine (Cys-TR1 or Cys-TR2). In C10 cells endogenous TR activity was insensitive to levels of hydrogen peroxide that hyperoxidize PRXs. Expression of Sec-TR1 increased TR activity, reduced the basal cytoplasmic redox state, and increased the rate of reduction of a redox-responsive cytoplasmic GFP probe (roGFP), but did not influence either the rate of inactivation or the rate of retro-reduction of PRXs. In comparison to roGFP, which was reduced within minutes once oxidants were removed reduction of 2-Cys PRXs occurred over many hours. Expression of wild type Sec-TR1 or Sec-TR2, but not Cys-TR1 or TR2, increased the rate of reduction of PRXs and improved cell survival after menadione exposure. These results indicate that expression levels of TR do not reduce the severity of initial oxidative insults, but rather govern the rate of reduction of cellular factors required for cell viability. Because Sec-TR is completely insensitive to cytotoxic levels of hydrogen peroxide, we suggest TR functions at the top of a redox pyramid that governs the oxidation state of peroxiredoxins and other protein factors, thereby dictating a hierarchy of phenotypic responses to oxidative insults.",

     "abstract": "The effectiveness of current treatment for age related macular degeneration (AMD) by targeting one molecule is limited due to its multifactorial nature and heterogeneous pathologies. Treatment strategy to target multiple signaling pathways or pathological components in AMD pathogenesis is under investigation for better clinical outcome. Inhibition of the redox function of apurinic endonuclease 1/redox factor-1 (APE1) was found to suppress endothelial angiogenesis and promote neuronal cell recovery, thereby may serve as a potential treatment for AMD. In the current study, we for the first time have found that a specific inhibitor of APE1 redox function by a small molecule compound E3330 regulates retinal pigment epithelium (RPEs) cell response to oxidative stress. E3330 significantly blocked sub-lethal doses of oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) induced proliferation decline and senescence advancement of RPEs. At the same time, E3330 remarkably decreased the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and down-regulated the productions of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as attenuated the level of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) p65 in RPEs. A panel of stress and toxicity responsive transcription factors that were significantly upregulated by oxLDL was restored by E3330, including Nrf2/Nrf1, p53, NF-\u03baB, HIF1, CBF/NF-Y/YY1, and MTF-1. Further, a single intravitreal injection of E3330 effectively reduced the progression of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in mouse eyes. These data revealed that E3330 effectively rescued RPEs from oxidative stress induced senescence and dysfunctions in multiple aspects in vitro, and attenuated laser-induced damages to RPE\u2013Bruch\u05f3s membrane complex in vivo. Together with its previously established anti-angiogenic and neuroprotection benefits, E3330 is implicated for potential use for AMD treatment.",

In the tert-butylhydroperoxide (t-BHP)-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line, desoxyrhapontigenin was the most potent component that reduced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and peroxynitrite. In response to desoxyrhapontigenin, the mRNA expression levels of antioxidant enzymes were up-regulated. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) confirmed that desoxyrhapontigenin promoted the DNA binding of Nrf2 and increased the expression of antioxidant proteins and enzymes regulated by Nrf2. Further investigation utilizing specific inhibitors of Akt, p38, JNK and ERK demonstrated that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway mediates HO-1 expression. Moreover, the increase in Nrf2 expression mediated by treatment with desoxyrhapontigenin was reversed by Nrf2 or Akt gene knock-down. In the LPS-induced in vivo lung inflammation model, pretreatment with desoxyrhapontigenin markedly ameliorated LPS-induced lung inflammation and histological changes. Immunohistochemical analysis of Nrf2, HO-1 and p65 was conducted and confirmed that treatment with desoxyrhapontigenin induced Nrf2 and HO-1 expression but reduced p65 expression. These findings suggest that desoxyrhapontigenin may be a potential therapeutic candidate as an antioxidant or an anti-inflammatory agent.",

     "abstract": "Exercise has been consistently used as an oxidant stimulus in redox biology studies. However, previous studies have focused on group differences and did not examine individual differences. As a result, it remains untested whether all individuals experience oxidative stress after acute exercise. Therefore, the main aim of the present study was to investigate whether some individuals exhibit unexpected responses after an acute eccentric (i.e., muscle-damaging) exercise session. Ninety eight (N\u00a0=\u00a098) young men performed an isokinetic eccentric exercise bout with the knee extensors. Plasma, erythrocytes and urine samples were collected immediately before and 2\u00a0days post-exercise. Three commonly used redox biomarkers (F2-isoprostanes, protein carbonyls and glutathione) were assayed. As expected, the two oxidant biomarkers (F2-isoprostanes and protein carbonyls) significantly increased 2\u00a0days after exercise (46% and 61%, respectively); whereas a significant decrease in glutathione levels (by \u221221%) was observed after exercise. A considerable number of the participants exhibited changes in the levels of biomarkers in the opposite, unexpected direction than the group average. More specifically, 13% of the participants exhibited a decrease in F2-isoprostanes and protein carbonyls and 10% of the participants exhibited an increase in glutathione levels. Furthermore, more than 1 out of 3 individuals exhibited either unexpected or negligible (from 0% to \u00b1\u00a05%) responses to exercise in at least one redox biomarker. It was also observed that the initial values of redox biomarkers are important predictors of the responses to exercise. In conclusion, although exercise induces oxidative stress in the majority of individuals, it can induce reductive stress or negligible stress in a considerable number of people. The data presented herein emphasize that the mean response to a redox stimulus can be very misleading. We believe that the wide variability (including the cases of reductive stress) described is not limited to the oxidant stimulus used and the biomarkers selected.",

Silencing NOX5 using NOX5-siRNA decreased NADPH oxidase activity (\u221245.1\u00b13.2% vs. mock-siRNA, n=6\u20138) in HT. D1-like receptor stimulation decreased NADPH oxidase activity to a greater extent in NT (\u221232.5\u00b11.8%) than HT (\u221214.8\u00b11.8). In contrast to the marked increase in expression and activity of NOX5 in HT, NOX1 mRNA and protein were minimally increased in HT, relative to NT; total NOX2 and NOX4 proteins were not different between HT and NT, while the increase in apical RPT cell membrane NOX1, NOX2, and NOX4 proteins in HT, relative to NT, was much less than those observed with NOX5. Thus, we demonstrate, for the first time, that NOX5 is expressed in human RPT cells and to greater extent than the other Nox isoforms in HT than NT. We suggest that the increased expression of NOX5, which may be responsible for the increased oxidative stress in RPT cells in human essential hypertension, is caused, in part, by a defective renal dopaminergic system.",

Treatment of MCF7 human breast adenocarcinoma cells with i6A or with three synthetic analogs (allyl6A, benzyl6A, and butyl6A) inhibited growth and altered gene expression. About 60% of the genes that were differentially expressed in response to i6A treatment were also modulated by the analogs, and pathway enrichment analysis identified the NRF2-mediated oxidative stress response as being significantly modulated by all four compounds. Luciferase reporter gene assays in transfected MCF7 cells confirmed that i6A activates the transcription factor NRF2. Assays for cellular production of reactive oxygen species indicated that i6A and analogs had antioxidant effects, reducing basal levels and inhibiting the H2O2- or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced production in MCF7 or dHL-60 (HL-60 cells induced to differentiate along the neutrophilic lineage) cell lines, respectively. In vivo, topical application of i6A or benzyl6A to mouse ears prior to TPA stimulation lessened the inflammatory response and significantly reduced the number of infiltrating neutrophils. These results suggest that i6A and analogs trigger a cellular response against oxidative stress and open the possibility of i6A and benzyl6A being used as topical anti-inflammatory drugs.",

     "abstract": "Many carbonyl species from either lipid peroxidation or glycoxidation are extremely reactive and can disrupt the function of proteins and enzymes. 4-hydroxynonenal and methylglyoxal are the most abundant and toxic lipid-derived reactive carbonyl species. The presence of these toxics leads to carbonyl stress and cause a significant amount of macromolecular damages in several diseases. Much evidence indicates trapping of reactive carbonyl intermediates may be a useful strategy for inhibiting or decreasing carbonyl stress-associated pathologies. There is no rapid and convenient analytical method available for the assessment of direct carbonyl scavenging capacity, and a very limited number of carbonyl scavengers have been identified to date, their therapeutic potential being highlighted only recently. In this context, we have developed a new and rapid sensitive fluorimetric method for the assessment of reactive carbonyl scavengers without involvement glycoxidation systems. Efficacy of various thiol- and non-thiol-carbonyl scavenger pharmacophores was tested both using this screening assay adapted to 96-well microplates and in cultured cells. The scavenging effects on the formation of Advanced Glycation End-product of Bovine Serum Albumin formed with methylglyoxal, 4-hydroxynonenal and glucose-glycated as molecular models were also examined. Low molecular mass thiols with an \u03b1-amino-\u03b2-mercaptoethane structure showed the highest degree of inhibitory activity toward both \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes and dicarbonyls. Cysteine and cysteamine have the best scavenging ability toward methylglyoxal. WR-1065 which is currently approved for clinical use as a protective agent against radiation and renal toxicity was identified as the best inhibitor of 4-hydroxynonenal.",

     "abstract": "Efavirenz (EFV) is an anti-retroviral drug frequently combined with isoniazid (INH) to treat HIV-1/tuberculosis co-infected patients. Both drugs have been associated with idiosyncratic liver injury (DILI), but combined anti-retroviral and anti-tubercular therapy can increase the risk for DILI as compared to either drug class alone. Because both EFV and INH have been implicated in targeting mitochondria, we aimed at exploring whether the two drugs might cause synergistic effects on the electron transport chain. We found that EFV inhibited complex I activity in isolated mouse liver mitochondria (IC50\u00a0\u02dc30\u00a0\u03bcM), whereas hydrazine, a major metabolite of INH generated by acylamidase-mediated hydrolytic cleavage, inhibited complex II activity (IC50\u00a0\u02dc30\u00a0\u03bcM). Neither INH alone (\u22641000\u00a0\u03bcM) nor EFV alone (\u226430\u00a0\u03bcM) was able to induce cell injury in cultured mouse hepatocytes. However, combined EFV/INH exposure resulted in increased superoxide formation and peroxynitrite stress, leading to the opening of the cyclosporine A-insensitive mode of the mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), and necrotic cell death. The peroxynitrite scavengers, CBA or Fe-TMPyP, protected against mPT induction and alleviated cell injury. The acylamidase inhibitor bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate prevented cell injury, suggesting that hydrazine greatly contributed to the toxicity. Methylene blue, a redox-active alternative electron acceptor/donor that bypasses complex I/II, effectively protected against EFV/INH-induced toxicity. These data demonstrate that, in murine hepatocytes, the mitochondrial electron transport chain is a critical target of combined EFV/INH exposure, and that this drug combination can lead to peroxynitrite stress-induced mPT and hepatocellular necrosis. These results are compatible with the concept that underlying silent mitochondrial dysfunction may be a key susceptibility factor contributing to idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury.",

Evidence shows that, via COX-mediated peroxidation, DGLA and its metabolites (1-series prostaglandins) are associated with anti-tumor activity, while AA and its metabolites (2-series prostaglandins) could be tightly implicated in various cancer diseases. However, it still remains a mystery why DGLA and AA possess contrasting bioactivities. Our previous studies showed that DGLA could go through an exclusive C-8 oxygenation pathway during COX-catalyzed lipid peroxidation in addition to a C-15 oxygenation pathway shared by both DGLA and AA, and that the exclusive C-8 oxygenation could lead to the production of distinct DGLA\u05f3s free radical derivatives that may be correlated with DGLA\u05f3s anti-proliferation activity. In the present work, we further investigate the anti-cancer effect of DGLA\u05f3s free radical derivatives and their associated molecular mechanisms. Our study shows that the exclusive DGLA\u05f3s free radical derivatives from C-8 oxygenation lead to cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in the human colon cancer cell line HCA-7 colony 29, probably by up-regulating the cancer suppressor p53 and the cell cycle inhibitor p27. In addition, these exclusive radical derivatives were also able to enhance the efficacy of 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), a widely used chemo-drug for colon cancer. For the first time, we show how DGLA\u05f3s radical pathway and metabolites are associated with DGLA\u05f3s anti-cancer activities and able to sensitize colon cancer cells to chemo-drugs such as 5-FU.

     "abstract": "Misfolding and aggregation of copper\u2013zinc superoxide dismutase (Sod1) are observed in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutations in Sod1 lead to familial ALS (FALS), which is a late-onset disease. Since oxidative damage to proteins increases with age, it had been proposed that oxidation of Sod1 mutants may trigger their misfolding and aggregation in FALS. However, over 90% of ALS cases are sporadic (SALS) with no obvious genetic component. We hypothesized that oxidation could also trigger the misfolding and aggregation of wild-type Sod1 and sought to confirm this in a cellular environment. Using quiescent, stationary-phase yeast cells as a model for non-dividing motor neurons, we probed for post-translational modification (PTM) and aggregation of wild-type Sod1 extracted from these cells. By size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), we isolated two populations of Sod1 from yeast: a low-molecular weight (LMW) fraction that is catalytically active and a catalytically inactive, high-molecular weight (HMW) fraction. High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis revealed that LMW Sod1 displays no PTMs but HMW Sod1 is oxidized at Cys146 and His71, two critical residues for the stability and folding of the enzyme. HMW Sod1 is also oxidized at His120, a copper ligand, which will promote loss of this catalytic metal cofactor essential for SOD activity. Monitoring the fluorescence of a Sod1-green-fluorescent-protein fusion (Sod1-GFP) extracted from yeast chromosomally expressing this fusion, we find that HMW Sod1-GFP levels increase up to 40-fold in old cells. Thus, we speculate that increased misfolding and inclusion into soluble aggregates is a consequence of elevated oxidative modifications of wild-type Sod1 as cells age. Our observations argue that oxidative damage to wild-type Sod1 initiates the protein misfolding mechanisms that give rise to SALS.",

     "abstract": "Plaque instability associated with acute coronary syndromes results in part from apoptosis and senescence of cells within the atherosclerotic (AS) lesion. Increased cellular oxidative stress has been proposed to contribute to plaque progression and changes in composition, leading to plaque instability. Our objective was to examine the role of NADPH oxidase in smooth muscle cell (SMC) phenotypes associated with an unstable plaque. Aortae were isolated from pre-lesion (8\u00a0weeks of age) and post-lesion (35\u00a0weeks of age) hypercholesterolemic mice (ApoE\u2212/\u2212/LDLR\u2212/\u2212, AS), and age-matched normal C57BL/6J mice. We observed an age-dependent increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) in aorta from AS mice, with evidence for elevated ROS prior to lesion development. Whereas macrophage infiltration was restricted to the lesion, oxidized lipids extended beyond the plaque and into the vessel wall. Consistent with these findings, we observed dynamic changes in the expression of NADPH oxidases in AS vessels. Specifically, Nox1 expression was increased early and decreased with lesion progression, while induction of Nox4 was a late event. Nox2 and p22phox were elevated throughout lesion development. Similar to observations in aortae, SMCs isolated from the lesion of AS aortae had decreased Nox1 and increased Nox4 levels as compared to SMCs from normal mice. AS SMCs demonstrated increased generation of ROS, cell cycle arrest, evidence of senescence, and increased susceptibility to apoptosis. Overexpression of Nox4 in normal SMCs recapitulated the phenotypes of the AS SMCs. We conclude that increased expression of Nox4 in AS may drive SMC phenotypes that lead to the plaque instability and rupture responsible for myocardial infarction and stroke.",

     "abstract": "Mutations in the DJ-1 gene have been shown to cause a rare autosomal-recessive genetic form of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). The function of DJ-1 and its role in PD development has been linked to multiple pathways, however its exact role in the development of PD has remained elusive. It is thought that DJ-1 may play a role in regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and overall oxidative stress in cells through directly scavenging ROS itself, or through the regulation of ROS scavenging systems such as glutathione (GSH) or thioredoxin (Trx) or ROS producing complexes such as complex I of the electron transport chain. Previous work in this laboratory has demonstrated that isolated brain mitochondria consume H2O2 predominantly by the Trx/Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR)/Peroxiredoxin (Prx) system in a respiration dependent manner (Drechsel et al., Journal of Biological Chemistry, 2010). Therefore we wanted to determine if mitochondrial H2O2 consumption was altered in brains from DJ-1 deficient mice (DJ-1\u2212/\u2212). Surprisingly, DJ-1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed an increase in mitochondrial respiration-dependent H2O2 consumption compared to controls. To determine the basis of the increased H2O2 consumption in DJ1\u2212/\u2212 mice, the activities of Trx, Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR), GSH, glutathione disulfide (GSSG) and glutathione reductase (GR) were measured. Compared to control mice, brains from DJ-1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed an increase in (1) mitochondrial Trx activity, (2) GSH and GSSG levels and (3) mitochondrial glutaredoxin (GRX) activity. Brains from DJ-1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a decrease in mitochondrial GR activity compared to controls. The increase in the enzymatic activities of mitochondrial Trx and total\u00a0GSH levels may account for the increased H2O2 consumption observed in the brain mitochondria in DJ-1\u2212/\u2212 mice perhaps as an adaptive response to chronic DJ-1 deficiency.",

Here, we describe that glutaredoxin 2 is also required for successful heart formation. Knock-down of glutaredoxin 2 in zebrafish embryos inhibits the invasion of cardiac neural crest cells into the primary heart field. This leads to impaired heart looping and subsequent obstructed blood flow. Glutaredoxin 2 specificity of the observed phenotype was confirmed by rescue experiments.

In this report, we demonstrate that this kind of abnormal mitochondrial respiratory chain-induced chronic oxidative stress affects fertility, pregnancy and delivery rates as well as causes recurrent abortions, occasionally resulting in maternal death. Despite this, spermatogenesis and early embryogenesis are completely normal, indicating the mutation's effects to be rather subtle. Female Tet-mev-1 mice exhibit thrombocytosis and splenomegaly in both non-pregnant and pregnant mice as well as placental angiodysplasia with reduced Flt-1 protein leading to hypoxic conditions, which could contribute to placental inflammation and fetal abnormal angiogenesis.

     "abstract": "Blood\u2013brain barrier disruption represents a key feature in hyperglycaemia-aggravated cerebral damage after an ischaemic stroke. Although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is thought to play a critical role. This study examined whether apoptosis of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC) might contribute to hyperglycaemia-evoked barrier damage and assessed the specific role of PKC in this phenomenon. Treatments with hyperglycaemia (25\u00a0mM) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, a protein kinase C activator, 100\u00a0nM) significantly increased NADPH oxidase activity, O2\u2022\u2212 generation, proapoptotic protein Bax expression, TUNEL-positive staining and caspase-3/7 activities. Pharmacological inhibition of NADPH oxidase, PKC-\u03b1, PKC-\u03b2 or PKC-\u03b2I via their specific inhibitors and neutralisation of O2\u2022\u2212 by a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic, MnTBAP normalised all the aforementioned increases induced by hyperglycaemia. Suppression of these PKC isoforms also negated the stimulatory effects of hyperglycaemia on the protein expression of NADPH oxidase membrane-bound components, Nox2 and p22-phox which determine the overall enzymatic activity. Silencing of PKC-\u03b2I gene through use of specific siRNAs abolished the effects of both hyperglycaemia and PMA on endothelial cell NADPH oxidase activity, O2\u2022\u2212 production and apoptosis and consequently improved the integrity and function of an in vitro model of human cerebral barrier comprising HBMEC, astrocytes and pericytes. Hyperglycaemia-mediated apoptosis of HBMEC contributes to cerebral barrier dysfunction and is modulated by sequential activations of PKC-\u03b2I and NADPH oxidase.",

     "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia is one of the main complications associated with extreme prematurity. Oxidative stress is suspected to be a trigger event of this lung disease, which is characterized by impaired alveolar development. Peroxides, mainly ascorbylperoxide and H2O2, are known contaminant of parenteral nutrition. We hypothesize that these oxidant molecules induce bronchopulmonary dysplasia development. The aim was to determine if the infusion of ascorbylperoxide, whether in presence or absence of H2O2, is associated with oxidative stress, apoptosis and loss of alveoli in the lungs of newborn guinea pigs.Three-day-old guinea pigs received parenteral solutions containing 0, 20, 60 or 180 \u00b5M ascorbylperoxide in the presence or not of 350\u00a0\u00b5M H2O2 (concentrations similar to those measured in parenteral nutrition). After 4\u00a0days, the lungs were collected for determination of glutathione's redox potential, caspase-3 activation (an apoptosis marker), alveolarization index (by histology), activation of Nrf2\u00a0and NF\u03baB (biological markers of oxidative stress), and IL-6\u00a0and PGJ2 levels (markers of NF\u03baB activation). Groups were compared by ANOVA, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.Loss of alveoli was associated with ascorbylperoxide in a dose-dependent manner, without an influence of H2O2. The dose-dependent activation of caspase-3 by ascorbylperoxide was lower in the presence of H2O2. Ascorbylperoxide induced an increase of redox potential in a dose-dependent manner, which reached a plateau in presence of H2O2. Nrf2 and NF\u03baB were activated by H2O2 but not by ascorbylperoxide.Results suggest that ascorbylperoxide, generated in parenteral nutrition, is involved in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, independently of the increase of the redox potential. This study underlines the importance of developing a safer formulation of parenteral nutrition.",

     "abstract": "Atherosclerosis and its complications are major causes of\u00a0death all over the world. One of the major risks\u00a0of atherosclerosis is hypercholesterolemia. During atherosclerosis, oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) regulates CD36-mediated activation of c-jun amino terminal kinase-1 (JNK1) and modulates matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) induction which stimulates inflammation with an invasion of monocytes. Additionally, inhibition of proteasome leads to an accumulation of c-jun and phosphorylated c-jun and activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1) related increase of MMP expression. We have previously reported a significant increase in cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) mRNA levels in hypercholesterolemic rabbits and shown that vitamin E treatment prevented the cholesterol induced increase in CD36 mRNA expression. In the present study, our aim is to identify the signaling molecules/transcription factors involved in the progression of atherosclerosis following CD36 activation in an in vivo model of hypercholesterolemic (induced by 2% cholesterol containing diet) rabbits. In this direction, proteasomal activities by fluorometry and c-jun, phospo c-jun, JNK1, MMP-9 expressions by quantitative RT-PCR and immunoblotting were tested in aortic tissues. The effects of vitamin E on these changes were also investigated in this model. As a result, c-jun was phosphorylated following decreased proteasomal degradation in hypercholesterolemic group. MMP-9 expression was also increased in cholesterol group rabbits contributing to the development of atherosclerosis. In addition, vitamin E showed its effect by decreasing MMP-9 levels and phosphorylation of c-jun.",

     "abstract": "Acyloxydiene\u2013Fe(CO)3 complexes can act as enzyme-triggered CO-releasing molecules (ET-CORMs). Their biological activity strongly depends on the mother compound from which they are derived, i.e. cyclohexenone or cyclohexanedione, and on the position of the ester functionality they harbour. The present study addresses if the latter characteristic affects CO release, if cytotoxicity of ET-CORMs is mediated through iron release or inhibition of cell respiration and to what extent cyclohexenone and cyclohexanedione derived ET-CORMs differ in their ability to counteract TNF-\u03b1 mediated inflammation. Irrespective of the formulation (DMSO or cyclodextrin), toxicity in HUVEC was significantly higher for ET-CORMs bearing the ester functionality at the outer (rac-4), as compared to the inner (rac-1) position of the cyclohexenone moiety. This was paralleled by an increased CO release from the former ET-CORM. Toxicity was not mediated via iron as EC50 values for rac-4 were significantly lower than for FeCl2 or FeCl3 and were not influenced by iron chelation. ATP depletion preceded toxicity suggesting impaired cell respiration as putative cause for cell death. In long-term HUVEC cultures inhibition of VCAM-1 expression by rac-1 waned in time, while for the cyclohexanedione derived rac-8 inhibition seems to increase. NF\u03baB was inhibited by both rac-1 and rac-8 independent of I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. Both ET-CORMs activated Nrf-2 and consequently induced the expression of HO-1.This study further provides a rational framework for designing acyloxydiene\u2013Fe(CO)3 complexes as ET-CORMs with differential CO release and biological activities. We also provide a better understanding of how these complexes affect cell-biology in mechanistic terms.",

     "abstract": "4-Hydroxy-2-(E)-nonenal (4-HNE) is one of the major lipid peroxidation product formed during oxidative stress. At high concentrations, 4-HNE is cytotoxic and exerts deleterious effects that are often associated with the pathology of oxidative stress-driven disease. Alternatively, at low concentrations it functions as a signaling molecule that can activate protective pathways including the antioxidant Nrf2-Keap1 pathway. Although these biphasic signaling properties have been enumerated in many diseases and pathways, it has yet to be addressed whether 4-HNE has the capacity to modulate oxidative stress-driven lipid peroxidation. Here we report an auto-regulatory mechanism of 4-HNE via modulation of the biological oxidant nitric oxide (NO). Utilizing LPS-activated macrophages to induce biological oxidant production, we demonstrate that 4-HNE modulates NO levels via inhibition of iNOS expression. We illustrate a proposed model of control of NO formation whereby at low concentrations of 4-HNE a negative feedback loop maintains a constant level of NO production with an observed inflection at approximately 1\u00a0\u00b5M, while at higher 4-HNE concentrations positive feedback is observed. Further, we demonstrate that this negative feedback loop of NO production control is dependent on the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway. Taken together, the careful regulation of NO production by 4-HNE argues for a more fundamental role of this lipid peroxidation product in normal physiology.",

     "abstract": "In skeletal muscle cells, GLUT1 is responsible for a large portion of basal uptake of glucose and dehydroascorbic acid, both of which play roles in antioxidant defense. We hypothesized that conditions that would decrease GLUT1-mediated transport would cause increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in L6 myoblasts, while conditions that would increase GLUT1-mediated transport would result in decreased ROS levels. We found that the GLUT1 inhibitors fasentin and phloretin increased the ROS levels induced by antimycin A and the superoxide generator pyrogallol. However, indinavir, which inhibits GLUT4 but not GLUT1, had no effect on ROS levels. Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) inhibitors and activators, previously shown to inhibit and augment GLUT1-mediated transport, increased and decreased ROS levels, respectively. Mutation of an ATM target site on GLUT1 (GLUT1-S490A) increased ROS levels and prevented the ROS-lowering effect of the ATM activator doxorubicin. In contrast, expression of GLUT1-S490D lowered ROS levels during challenge with pyrogallol, prevented an increase in ROS when ATM was inhibited, and prevented the pyrogallol-induced decrease in insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Taken together, the data suggest that GLUT1 plays a role in regulation of ROS and could contribute to maintenance of insulin action in the presence of ROS.",

     "abstract": "Fish are exposed to many kinds of environmental stressors and the chances of succumbing to infectious diseases may be increased a result. For example, an acute increase in temperature can induce numerous physiological changes in the body. In the present study, we examined the redox state in response to a severe acute stress resulting from heat shock in teleost coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). The plasma lipid peroxides levels in fish gradually increased after heat shock treatment. By 2.5\u2009h post-heat stress, plasma glutathione (GSH) levels had decreased, but they had returned to basal levels by 17.5\u2009h post-stress. Plasma superoxide dismutase activities in stressed fish were significantly increased compared with those in control fish at 17.5\u2009h post-stress, but had returned to basal levels by 48\u2009h post-stress. Expression levels of hepatic GSH and heat shock protein 70 gradually increased after heat shock treatment. These results concerning the changing patterns of multiple important redox-related biomarkers suggest that severe thermal stressors can affect the redox state and induce oxidative stress in ectothermal animals, such as fish, in vivo. Hence, manipulation of appropriate thermal treatment may possibly be useful to control fish fitness.",

     "abstract": "Acute anemia increases the risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients who experience blood loss and fluid resuscitation (hemodilution). Animal models of acute anemia suggest that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-derived nitric oxide (NO) is adaptive and protects against anemia-induced mortality. During acute anemia, we have observed a small but consistent increase in methemoglobin (MetHb) levels that is inversely proportional to the acute reduction in Hb observed during hemodilution in animals and humans. We hypothesize that this increase in MetHb may be a biomarker of anemia-induced tissue hypoxia. The increase in MetHb may occur by at least two mechanisms: (1) direct hemoglobin oxidation by increased nNOS-derived NO within the perivascular tissue and (2) by increased deoxyhemoglobin (DeoxyHb) nitrite reductase activity within the vascular compartment. Both mechanisms reflect a potential increase in NO signaling from the tissue and vascular compartments during anemia. These responses are thought to be adaptive; as deletion of nNOS results in increased mortality in a model of acute anemia. Finally, it is possible that prolonged activation of these mechanisms may lead to maladaptive changes in redox signaling. We hypothesize, increased MetHb in the vascular compartment during acute anemia may reflect activation of adaptive mechanisms which augment NO signaling. Understanding the link between anemia, MetHb and its treatments (transfusion of stored blood) may help us to develop novel treatment strategies to reduce the risk of anemia-induced morbidity and mortality.",

Because of the diverse mitochondrial changes found, some authors proposed that the affected gene should codify for a mitochondrial protein. Later, the CFTR cloning and the demonstration of its chloride channel activity turned the mitochondrial, lysosomal and cytosolic hypotheses obsolete. However, in recent years, using new approaches, several investigators reported similar or new alterations of mitochondrial functions in Cystic Fibrosis, thus rediscovering a possible role of mitochondria in this disease. Here, we review these CFTR-driven mitochondrial defects, including differential gene expression, alterations in oxidative phosphorylation, calcium homeostasis, oxidative stress, apoptosis and innate immune response, which might explain some characteristics of the complex CF phenotype and reveals potential new targets for therapy.",

     "abstract": "The elimination of oxidatively modified proteins is a crucial process in maintaining cellular homeostasis, especially during stress. Mitochondria are protein-dense, high traffic compartments, whose polypeptides are constantly exposed to superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, and other reactive species, generated by \u2018electron leakage\u2019 from the respiratory chain. The level of oxidative stress to mitochondrial proteins is not constant, but instead varies greatly with numerous metabolic and environmental factors. Oxidized mitochondrial proteins must be removed rapidly (by proteolytic degradation) or they will aggregate, cross-link, and cause toxicity. The Lon Protease is a key enzyme in the degradation of oxidized proteins within the mitochondrial matrix. Under conditions of acute stress Lon is highly inducible, possibly with the oxidant acting as the signal inducer, thereby providing increased protection. It seems that under chronic stress conditions, however, Lon levels actually decline. Lon levels also decline with age and with senescence, and senescent cells even lose the ability to induce Lon during acute stress. We propose that the regulation of Lon is biphasic, in that it is up-regulated during transient stress and down-regulated during chronic stress and aging, and we suggest that the loss of Lon responsiveness may be a significant factor in aging, and in age-related diseases.",

Electron and confocal microscopy analysis of liver tissues revealed that APAP overdose triggers unique biochemical and pathological zonated changes in the mouse liver, which includes necrosis (zone 1), mitochondrial spheroid formation (zone 2), autophagy (zone 3) and mitochondrial biogenesis (zone 4). In this graphic review, we discuss the role of autophagy/mitophagy in limiting the expansion of necrosis and promoting mitochondrial biogenesis and liver regeneration for the recovery of APAP-induced liver injury.

     "abstract": "For years, there have been studies based on the use of natural compounds plant-derived as potential therapeutic agents for various diseases in humans. Curcumin is a phenolic compound extracted from Curcuma longa rhizome commonly used in Asia as a spice, pigment and additive. In traditional medicine of India and China, curcumin is considered as a therapeutic agent used in several foods. Numerous studies have shown that curcumin has broad biological functions particularly antioxidant and antiinflammatory. In fact, it has been established that curcumin is a bifunctional antioxidant; it exerts antioxidant activity in a direct and an indirect way by scavenging reactive oxygen species and inducing an antioxidant response, respectively. The renoprotective effect of curcumin has been evaluated in several experimental models including diabetic nephropathy, chronic renal failure, ischemia and reperfusion and nephrotoxicity induced by compounds such as gentamicin, adriamycin, chloroquine, iron nitrilotriacetate, sodium fluoride, hexavalent chromium and cisplatin. It has been shown recently in a model of chronic renal failure that curcumin exerts a therapeutic effect; in fact it reverts not only systemic alterations but also glomerular hemodynamic changes. Another recent finding shows that the renoprotective effect of curcumin is associated to preservation of function and redox balance of mitochondria. Taking together, these studies attribute the protective effect of curcumin in the kidney to the induction of the master regulator of antioxidant response nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2 (Nrf2), inhibition of mitochondrial dysfunction, attenuation of inflammatory response, preservation of antioxidant enzymes and prevention of oxidative stress. The information presented in this paper identifies curcumin as a promising renoprotective molecule against renal injury.",

MnPs can produce both pro-oxidative and antioxidative effects depending upon the cellular redox environment that they encounter. Previously we reported (Free Radic. Res. 39: 81\u20138, 2005) that when the treatment started at the onset of diabetes, Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-methylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTM-2-PyP5+ suppressed diabetes-induced oxidative stress. Diabetes, however, is rarely diagnosed at its onset. The aim of this study was to investigate if MnTM-2-PyP5+ can suppress oxidative damage and prevent diabetic complications when administered more than a week after the onset of diabetes. Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. The MnP-based treatment started 8 days after the onset of diabetes and continued for 2 months. The effect of the treatment on activities of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and glyoxalases I and II as well as malondialdehyde and GSH/GSSG ratio were determined in kidneys. Kidney function was assessed by measuring lysozyme and total protein in urine and blood urea nitrogen. Vascular damage was evaluated by assessing vascular reactivity. Our data showed that delayed administration of MnTM-2-PyP5+ did not protect against oxidative damage and did not prevent diabetic complications. Moreover, MnTM-2-PyP5+ contributed to the kidney damage, which seems to be a consequence of its pro-oxidative action. Such outcome can be explained by advanced oxidative damage which already existed at the moment the therapy with MnP started. The data support the concept that the overall biological effect of a redox-active MnP is determined by (i) the relative concentrations of oxidants and reductants, i.e. the cellular redox environment and (ii) MnP biodistribution.",

Furthermore, it likely mediates effects of emerging, less well-defined variables that contribute to residual risk not explained by traditional factors. Functional oxidative modifications of cellular proteins, both reversible and irreversible, are a causal step in cellular dysfunction. Identifying markers of oxidative stress has been the focus of many researchers as they have the potential to act as an \u201cintegrator\u201d of a multitude of processes that drive cardiovascular pathobiology. One of the major challenges is the accurate quantification of reactive oxygen species with very short half-life. Redox-sensitive proteins with important cellular functions are confined to signalling microdomains in cardiovascular cells and are not readily available for quantification. A popular approach is the measurement of stable by-products modified under conditions of oxidative stress that have entered the circulation. However, these may not accurately reflect redox stress at the cell/tissue level. Many of these modifications are \u201cfunctionally silent\u201d. Functional significance of the oxidative modifications enhances their validity as a proposed biological marker of cardiovascular disease, and is the strength of the redox cysteine modifications such as glutathionylation.

     "abstract": "4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) is one of the most studied products of phospholipid peroxidation, owing to its reactivity and cytotoxicity. It can be formed by several radical-dependent oxidative routes involving the formation of hydroperoxides, alkoxyl radicals, epoxides, and fatty acyl cross-linking reactions. Cleavage of the oxidized fatty acyl chain results in formation of HNE from the methyl end, and 9-oxo-nonanoic acid from the carboxylate or esterified end of the chain, although many other products are also possible. HNE can be metabolized in tissues by a variety of pathways, leading to detoxification and excretion. HNE-adducts to proteins have been detected in inflammatory situations such as atherosclerotic lesions using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, which have also been applied in ELISAs and western blotting. However, in order to identify the proteins modified and the exact sites and nature of the modifications, mass spectrometry approaches are required. Combinations of enrichment strategies with targetted mass spectrometry routines such as neutral loss scanning are now facilitating detection of HNE-modified proteins in complex biological samples. This is important for characterizing the interactions of HNE with redox sensitive cell signalling proteins and understanding how it may modulate their activities either physiologically or in disease.",

     "abstract": "The reversible redox conversion of nitrite and nitric oxide (NO) in a physiological setting is now widely accepted. Nitrite has long been identified as a stable intermediate of NO oxidation but several lines of evidence support the reduction of nitrite to nitric oxide in vivo. In the gut, this notion implies that nitrate from dietary sources fuels the longstanding production of nitrite in the oral cavity followed by univalent reduction to NO in the stomach. Once formed, NO boosts a network of reactions, including the production of higher nitrogen oxides that may have a physiological impact via the post-translational modification of proteins and lipids. Dietary compounds, such as polyphenols, and different prandial states (secreting specific gastric mediators) modulate the outcome of these reactions. The gut has unusual characteristics that modulate nitrite and NO redox interplay: (1) wide range of pH (neutral vs acidic) and oxygen tension (c.a. 70\u00a0Torr in the stomach and nearly anoxic in the colon), (2) variable lumen content and (3) highly developed enteric nervous system (sensitive to NO and dietary compounds, such as glutamate). The redox interplay of nitrite and NO might also participate in the regulation of brain homeostasis upon neuronal glutamatergic stimulation in a process facilitated by ascorbate and a localized and transient decrease of oxygen tension. In a way reminiscent of that occurring in the stomach, a nitrite/NO/ascorbate redox interplay in the brain at glutamatergic synapses, contributing to local NO increase, may impact on NO-mediated process.We here discuss the implications of the redox conversion of nitrite to NO in the gut, how nitrite-derived NO may signal from the digestive to the central nervous system, influencing brain function, as well as a putative ascorbate-driven nitrite/NO pathway occurring in the brain.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that the abnormal regulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, essential components of the UPS, contributes to uncontrolled proliferation, genomic instability and cancer, since these ligases and their substrates are involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression, gene transcription, signal transduction, DNA replication and others. Through selective degradation of specific substrates, E3 ligases regulate different biological processes. Cullins are a family of proteins that confer substrate specificity to multimeric complex of E3 ligases acting as scaffold proteins. So far, seven members of the cullin family of proteins have been identified. Interestingly, the data generated by several groups indicate that cullin 3 (Cul3) has begun to emerge as a protein involved in the etiopathology of multiple diseases. In this paper we examine the latest advances in basic research on the biology of Cul3 and how it could help to direct drug discovery efforts on this target.",

Beyond canonical nitric oxide signaling pathways, nitric oxide production results in the post-translational modification of protein thiols, termed S-nitrosation. The potential interplay between S-nitrosation and ROS remains poorly understood and is the focus of the current study. The effects of the S-nitrosating agent S-nitrosocysteine (CysNO) in combination with redox-cycling agents was examined in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). CysNO significantly impairs mitochondrial function and depletes the NADH/NAD+ pool; however, these changes do not result in cell death. When faced with the additional stressor of a redox-cycling agent used to generate ROS, further loss of NAD+ occurs, and cellular ATP pools are depleted. Cellular S-nitrosothiols also accumulate, and cell death is triggered. These data demonstrate that CysNO sensitizes endothelial cells to redox-cycling agent-dependent mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death and identify attenuated degradation of S-nitrosothiols as one potential mechanism for the enhanced cytotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "Aging and age-related diseases are associated with cellular senescence that results in variable apoptosis susceptibility to oxidative stress. Although fibroblast senescence has been associated with apoptosis resistance, mechanisms for this have not been well defined. In this report, we studied epigenetic mechanisms involving histone modifications that confer apoptosis resistance to senescent human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs). HDFs that undergo replicative senescence display typical morphological features, express senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase, and increased levels of the tumor suppressor genes, p16, p21, and caveolin-1. Senescent HDFs are more resistant to oxidative stress (exogenous H2O2)-induced apoptosis in comparison to non-senescent (control) HDFs; this is associated with constitutively high levels of the anti-apoptotic gene, Bcl-2, and low expression of the pro-apoptotic gene, Bax. Cellular senescence is characterized by global increases in H4K20 trimethylation and decreases in H4K16 acetylation in association with increased activity of Suv420h2 histone methyltransferase (which targets H4K20), decreased activity of the histone acetyltransferase, Mof (which targets H4K16), as well as decreased total histone acetyltransferase activity. In contrast to Bax gene, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrate marked enrichment of the Bcl-2 gene with H4K16Ac, and depletion with H4K20Me3, predicting active transcription of this gene in senescent HDFs. These data indicate that both global and locus-specific histone modifications of chromatin regulate altered Bcl-2:Bax gene expression in senescent fibroblasts, contributing to its apoptosis-resistant phenotype.",

     "abstract": "Excessive production of unsaturated aldehydes from oxidized lipoproteins and membrane lipids is a characteristic feature of cardiovascular disease. Our previous studies show that unsaturated lipid peroxidation-derived aldehydes such as 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) promote autophagy in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMC). In this study, we examined the mechanism by which HNE induces autophagy. Exposure of RASMC to HNE led to the modification of several proteins, most of which were identified by mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). HNE stimulated the phosphorylation of PKR-like ER kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 and increased heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) abundance. HNE treatment also increased LC3-II formation and the phosphorylation of JNK and p38. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK, but not p38, prevented HNE-induced HO-1 expression and LC3-II formation. Inhibition of JNK increased cell death in HNE-treated cells. Pretreatment with the chemical chaperone phenylbutryic acid prevented LC3-II formation as well as JNK phosphorylation and HO-1 induction. Taken together, these data suggest that autophagic responses triggered by unsaturated aldehydes could be attributed, in part, to ER stress, which stimulates autophagy by a JNK-dependent mechanism and promotes cell survival during oxidative stress.",

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists have antineoplastic properties which present new redox-dependent targets for glioma anticancer therapies.

In contrast, these same agonists had no effect on catalase expression and activity in malignant rat glioma cells. The increase in steady-state catalase mRNA observed in normal rat astrocytes was due, in part, to de novo mRNA synthesis as opposed to increased catalase mRNA stability. Moreover, pioglitazone-mediated induction of catalase activity in normal rat astrocytes was completely blocked by transfection with a PPAR\u03b3-dominant negative plasmid. These data suggest that defects in PPAR-mediated signaling and gene expression may represent a block to normal catalase expression and induction in malignant glioma.

One of the approaches employed to target molecules to the mitochondrion is to conjugate a delocalized cation such as triphenylphosphonium (TPP+) to various redox active compounds. Mitochondrially targeted antioxidants have also been used in numerous cell culture based studies as probes of the contribution of the mitochondrial generation of reactive oxygen species on cell signaling events. However, concentrations used in vitro are typically 10\u2013100 times greater than those generated from oral dosing in a wide range of animal models and in humans. In the present study, we determined the effects of mitochondrial targeted antioxidants, MitoQ, MitoTempol, and MitoE on cellular bioenergetics of mesangial cells in culture and compared these to TPP+ conjugated compounds which lack the antioxidant functional group. We found that all TPP+ compounds inhibited oxidative phosphorylation to different extents independent of the antioxidant functional groups. These findings show that the TPP+ moiety can disrupt mitochondrial function at concentrations frequently observed in cell culture and this behavior is dependent on the linker group and independent of antioxidant properties. Moreover, the TPP+ moiety alone is unlikely to achieve the concentrations needed to contribute to the protective mechanisms of the mitochondrially targeted compounds that have been reported in vivo.",

     "abstract": "JS-K is a nitric oxide (NO)-releasing prodrug of the O2-arylated diazeniumdiolate family that has demonstrated pronounced cytotoxicity and antitumor properties in a variety of cancer models both in vitro and in vivo. The current study of the metabolic actions of JS-K was undertaken to investigate mechanisms of its cytotoxicity. Consistent with model chemical reactions, the activating step in the metabolism of JS-K in the cell is the dearylation of the diazeniumdiolate by glutathione (GSH) via a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction. The resulting product (CEP/NO anion) spontaneously hydrolyzes, releasing two equivalents of NO. The GSH/GSSG redox couple is considered to be the major redox buffer of the cell, helping maintain a reducing environment under basal conditions. We have quantified the effects of JS-K on cellular GSH content, and show that JS-K markedly depletes GSH, due to JS-K's rapid uptake and cascading release of NO and reactive nitrogen species. The depletion of GSH results in alterations in the redox potential of the cellular environment, initiating MAPK stress signaling pathways, and inducing apoptosis. Microarray analysis confirmed signaling gene changes at the transcriptional level and revealed alteration in the expression of several genes crucial for maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis, as well as cell proliferation and survival, including MYC. Pre-treating cells with the known GSH precursor and nucleophilic reducing agent N-acetylcysteine prevented the signaling events that lead to apoptosis. These data indicate that multiplicative depletion of the reduced glutathione pool and deregulation of intracellular redox balance are important initial steps in the mechanism of JS-K's cytotoxic action.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress-induced decrease in tissue or systemic glutathione (GSH) and damage to the vascular endothelium of the blood-brain barrier such as occurs in diabetes or stroke will have important implications for brain homeostasis. Endothelial proliferation or repair is crucial to preserving barrier function. Cell proliferation has been associated with increased intracellular GSH, but the kinetic and distribution of GSH during cell cycle is poorly understood. Here, we determined the influence of cellular GSH status on the early dynamics of nuclear-to-cytosol (N-to-C) GSH distribution (6-h interval) during proliferation in a human brain microvascular endothelial cell line (IHEC). Control IHECs exhibited two peak S-phases of the cell cycle at 48 and 60\u00a0h post seeding that temporally corresponded to peak nuclear GSH levels and expression of cdk1, the S-to-G2-to-M checkpoint controller, suggesting a link between cell cycle progression and nuclear GSH. Sustained inhibition of GSH synthesis delayed S-to-G2/M cell transition; cell arrest in the S-phase was correlated with decreased total nuclear GSH and increased nuclear expressions of chk2/phospho-chk2 and GADPH. The temporal correspondence of nuclear chk2 activation and GAPDH expression with S-phase prolongation is consistent with enhanced DNA damage response and extended time for DNA repair. Strikingly, when GSH synthesis was restored, cell transit time through S-phase remained delayed. Significantly, total nuclear GSH remained depressed, indicating a time lag between restored cellular GSH synthetic capacity and recovery of the nuclear GSH status. Interestingly, despite a delay in cell cycle recovery, nuclear expressions of chk2/phospho-chk2 and GAPDH resembled those of control cells. This means that restoration of nuclear DNA integrity preceded normalization of the cell cycle. The current results provide important insights into GSH control of endothelial proliferation with implications for cell repair or wound healing in recovery post-oxidative damage.",

     "abstract": "Past work has shown that exposure to gamma rays and protons elicit a persistent oxidative stress in rodent and human neural stem cells (hNSCs). We have now adapted these studies to more realistic exposure scenarios in space, using lower doses and dose rates of these radiation modalities, to further elucidate the role of radiation-induced oxidative stress in these cells. Rodent neural stem and precursor cells grown as neurospheres and human neural stem cells grown as monolayers were subjected to acute and multi-dosing paradigms at differing dose rates and analyzed for changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), nitric oxide and superoxide for 2 days after irradiation. While acute exposures led to significant changes in both cell types, hNSCs in particular, exhibited marked and significant elevations in radiation-induced oxidative stress. Elevated oxidative stress was more significant in hNSCs as opposed to their rodent counterparts, and hNSCs were significantly more sensitive to low dose exposures in terms of survival. Combinations of protons and \u03b3-rays delivered as lower priming or higher challenge doses elicited radioadaptive changes that were associated with improved survival, but in general, only under conditions where the levels of reactive species were suppressed compared to cells irradiated acutely. Protective radioadaptive effects on survival were eliminated in the presence of the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, suggesting further that radiation-induced oxidative stress could activate pro-survival signaling pathways that were sensitive to redox state. Data corroborates much of our past work and shows that low dose and dose rate exposures elicit significant changes in oxidative stress that have functional consequences on survival.",

Though ascribed for impairment in endothelial cell function, molecular mechanisms of these significant adverse pulmonary outcomes remains poorly understood. As preliminary studies conducted in past have failed to demonstrate a cause-effect relationship between isocyanate toxicity and compromised pulmonary endothelial cell function, we hypothesized that direct exposure to isocyanate may disrupt endothelial structural lining, resulting in cellular damage. Based on this premise, we comprehensively evaluated the molecular repercussions of methyl isocyanate (MIC) exposure on human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (HPAE-26). We examined MIC-induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokine response, oxidative DNA damage response and apoptotic index. Our results demonstrate that exposure to MIC, augment mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production, depletion in antioxidant defense enzymes, elevated pro-inflammatory cytokine response and induced endothelial cell apoptosis via affecting the balance of mitochondrial-nuclear cross talk. We herein delineate the first and direct molecular cascade of isocyanate-induced pulmonary endothelial cell dysfunction. The results of our study might portray a connective link between associated respiratory morbidities with isocyanate exposure, and indeed facilitate to discern the exposure-phenotype relationship in observed deficits of pulmonary endothelial cell function. Further, understanding of inter- and intra-cellular signaling pathways involved in isocyanate-induced endothelial damage would not only aid in biomarker identification but also provide potential new avenues to target specific therapeutic interventions.",

Mice born with constitutive genetic knockout of Sod2 do not survive the neonatal stage, which renders the longitudinal study of the biochemical and metabolic effects of Sod2 loss difficult. However, multiple studies have demonstrated that tissue-specific knockout of Sod2 in murine liver yields no observable gross pathology or injury to the mouse. We hypothesized that Sod2 loss may have sub-pathologic effects on liver biology, including the acquisition of reactive oxygen species-mediated mitochondrial DNA mutations. To evaluate this, we established and verified a hepatocyte-specific knockout of Sod2 in C57/B6 mice using Cre-LoxP recombination technology. We utilized deep sequencing to identify possible mutations in Sod2\u2212/\u2212 mitochondrial DNA as compared to wt, and both RT-PCR and traditional biochemical assays to evaluate baseline differences in redox-sensitive pathways in Sod2\u2212/\u2212 hepatocytes. Surprisingly, no mutations in Sod2\u2212/\u2212 mitochondrial DNA were detected despite measurable increases in dihydroethidium staining in situ and concomitant decreases in complex II activity indicative of elevated superoxide in the Sod2\u2212/\u2212 hepatocytes. In contrast, numerous compensatory alterations in gene expression were identified that suggest hepatocytes have a remarkable capacity to adapt and overcome the loss of Sod2 through transcriptional means. Taken together, these results suggest that murine hepatocytes have a large reserve capacity to cope with the presence of additional mitochondrial reactive oxygen species.",

Due to either proteolysis or alternative translation, Nrf1 has been found as proteins of varying size, p120, p95, and p65, which have been described as either activators of EpRE or competitive inhibitors of Nrf2. We investigated the effect of Nrf1 on EpRE-regulated gene expression using the catalytic and modifier subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLC and GCLM) as models and explored the potential role of Nrf1 in altering their expression in aging and upon chronic exposure to airborne nano-sized particulate matter (nPM). Nrf1 knockout resulted in the increased expression of GCLC and GCLM in human bronchial epithelial (HBE1) cells. Overexpression Nrf2 in combination with either p120 or p65 diminished or failed to further increase the GCLC- and GLCM-EpRE luciferase activity. All known forms of Nrf1 protein, remained unchanged in the lungs of mice with age or in response to nPM. Our study shows that Nrf1 could inhibit EpRE activity in vitro, whereas the precise role of Nrf1 in vivo requires further investigations. We conclude that Nrf1 may not be directly responsible for the loss of Nrf2-dependent inducibility of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes observed in aged animals.",

     "abstract": "Nitric oxide (NO) is a biologically important short-lived free radical signaling molecule. Both the enzymatic synthesis and the predominant forms of cellular metabolism of NO are oxygen-dependent. For these reasons, changes in local oxygen concentrations can have a profound influence on steady-state NO concentrations. Many proteins are regulated by NO in a concentration-dependent manner, but their responses are elicited at different thresholds. Using soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and p53 as model NO-sensitive proteins, we demonstrate that their concentration-dependent responses to NO are a function of the O2 concentration. p53 requires relatively high steady-state NO concentrations (>600\u00a0nM) to induce its phosphorylation (P-ser-15), whereas sGC responds to low NO concentrations (<100\u00a0nM). At a constant rate of NO production (liberation from NO-donors), decreasing the O2 concentration (1%) lowers the rate of NO metabolism. This raises steady-state NO concentrations and allows p53 activation at lower doses of the NO donor. Enzymatic NO production, however, requires O2 as a substrate such that decreasing the O2 concentration below the Km for O2 for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) will decrease the production of NO. We demonstrate that the amount of NO produced by RAW 264.7 macrophages is a function of the O2 concentration. Differences in rates of NO production and NO metabolism result in differential sGC activation that is not linear with respect to O2. There is an optimal O2 concentration (\u22485\u20138%) where a balance between the synthesis and metabolism of NO is established such that both the NO concentration and sGC activation are maximal.",

In the present study, we establish that expression and nuclear localization of IL-1\u03b1 are redox-dependent. Shifts in steady-state H2O2 concentrations (SS-[H2O2]) resulting from enforced expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) drive IL-1\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression. The redox-dependent expression of IL-1\u03b1 is accompanied by its increased nuclear localization. Both IL-1\u03b1 expression and its nuclear residency are abrogated by catalase co-expression. Sub-lethal doses of H2O2 also cause IL-1\u03b1 nuclear localization. Mutagenesis revealed IL-1\u03b1 nuclear localization does not involve oxidation of cysteines within its N terminal domain. Inhibition of the processing enzyme calpain prevents IL-1\u03b1 nuclear localization even in the presence of H2O2. H2O2 treatment caused extracellular Ca2+ influx suggesting oxidants may influence calpain activity indirectly through extracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Functionally, as a result of its nuclear activity, IL-1\u03b1 overexpression promotes NF-kB activity, but also interacts with the histone acetyl transferase (HAT) p300. Together, these findings demonstrate a mechanism by which oxidants impact inflammation through IL-1\u03b1 and suggest that antioxidant-based therapies may prove useful in limiting inflammatory disease progression.",

     "abstract": "Cigarette smoking remains a major health concern worldwide, and many of the adverse effects of cigarette smoke (CS) can be attributed to its abundant electrophilic aldehydes, such as acrolein (2-propenal). Previous studies indicate that acrolein readily reacts with thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1), a critical enzyme involved in regulation of thioredoxin (Trx)-mediated redox signaling, by alkylation at its selenocysteine (Sec) residue. Because alkylation of Sec within TrxR1 has significant implications for its enzymatic function, we explored the potential importance of TrxR1 alkylation in acrolein-induced activation or injury of bronchial epithelial cells. Exposure of human bronchial epithelial HBE1 cells to acrolein (1\u201330\u00a0\u03bcM) resulted in dose-dependent loss of TrxR thioredoxin reductase activity, which coincided with its alkylation, as determined by biotin hydrazide labeling, and was independent of initial GSH status. To test the involvement of TrxR1 in acrolein responses in HBE1 cells, we suppressed TrxR1 using siRNA silencing or augmented TrxR1 by cell supplementation with sodium selenite. Acrolein exposure of HBE1 cells induced dose-dependent activation of the MAP kinases, extracellular regulated1 kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38, and activation of JNK was markedly enhanced after selenite-mediated induction of TrxR1, and was associated with increased alkylation of TrxR1. Conversely, siRNA silencing of TrxR1 significantly suppressed the ability of acrolein to activate JNK, and also appeared to attenuate acrolein-dependent activation of ERK and p38. Alteration of initial TrxR1 levels by siRNA or selenite supplementation also affected initial Trx1 redox status and acrolein-mediated alkylation of Trx1, but did not significantly affect acrolein-mediated activation of HO-1 or cytotoxicity. Collectively, our findings indicate that alkylation of TrxR1 and/or Trx1 may contribute directly to acrolein-mediated activation of MAP kinases such as JNK, and may therefore be important in acrolein-induced alterations in airway epithelial function, as a contributing mechanism in tobacco-related respiratory disease.",

Certain anticancer agents (e.g. anthracyclines and cisplatin) generate damaging reactive oxygen species as by-products of their mechanism of action. Drug effectiveness can therefore depend upon the presence of cellular redox buffering systems that are often deregulated in cancer. The expression of the redox protein, thioredoxin interacting protein, was assessed in gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinomas. Thioredoxin interacting protein expression was assessed using conventional immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray of 140 adenocarcinoma patients treated by primary surgery alone and 88 operable cases treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the primary surgery cases, high thioredoxin interacting protein expression associated with a lack of lymph node involvement (p=0.005), no perineural invasion (p=0.030) and well/moderate tumour differentiation (p=0.033). In the neoadjuvant tumours, high thioredoxin interacting protein expression was an independent marker for improved disease specific survival (p=0.002) especially in cases with anthracycline-based regimes (p=0.008). This study highlights the potential of thioredoxin interacting protein as a biomarker for response in neoadjuvant treated gastro-oesophageal adenocarcinoma and may represent a useful therapeutic target due to its association with tumour progression.",

Reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione and its precursors [\u03b3-glutamyl cysteine (\u03b3-GC) and L-cysteine (CySH)] content and expression of several redox-sensitive genes were evaluated in newborn lung and brain tissue 1 (P1) and 7 (P7) days after birth.As compared with control animals, the GSH/GSSG ratio was increased in the hypoxic group at P1 and P7 in the lung, and at P7 in the brain. In the hypoxic group a significant increase in the mRNA levels of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (noq1), Sulfiredoxin 1 (srnx1) and Glutathione Peroxidase 1 (gpx) was found in lung tissue at P1, as well as a significant increase in gpx in brain tissue at P7.Delaying the increase in tissue oxygenation to occur after birth reduces short-and-long-term oxidative stress in the lung. Similar yet more subtle effects were found in the brain. Apparently, the fetal-to-neonatal transition under hypoxic conditions appears to have protective qualities.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial radical production is important in redox signaling, aging and disease, but the relative contributions of different production sites are poorly understood. We analyzed the rates of superoxide/H2O2 production from different defined sites in rat skeletal muscle mitochondria oxidizing a variety of conventional substrates in the absence of added inhibitors: succinate; glycerol 3-phosphate; palmitoylcarnitine plus carnitine; or glutamate plus malate. In all cases, the sum of the estimated rates accounted fully for the measured overall rates. There were two striking results. First, the overall rates differed by an order of magnitude between substrates. Second, the relative contribution of each site was very different with different substrates. During succinate oxidation, most of the superoxide production was from the site of quinone reduction in complex I (site IQ), with small contributions from the flavin site in complex I (site IF) and the quinol oxidation site in complex III (site IIIQo). However, with glutamate plus malate as substrate, site IQ made little or no contribution, and production was shared between site IF, site IIIQo and 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. With palmitoylcarnitine as substrate, the flavin site in complex II (site IIF) was a major contributor (together with sites IF and IIIQo), and with glycerol 3-phosphate as substrate, five different sites all contributed, including glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Thus, the relative and absolute contributions of specific sites to the production of reactive oxygen species in isolated mitochondria depend very strongly on the substrates being oxidized, and the same is likely true in cells and in vivo.",

Nitric oxide is a highly reactive free radical gas that is difficult to deliver with precise control over the level and timing that cells actually experience. We describe and characterize a device that allows tunable fluxes and patterns of NO to be generated across the surface upon which cells are cultured. The system is based on a quartz microscope slide that allows for controlled light levels to be applied to a previously described photosensitive NO-releasing polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Cells are cultured in separate wells that are either NO-releasing or a chemically similar PDMS that does not release NO. Both wells are then top coated with DowCorning RTV-3140 PDMS and a polydopamine/gelatin layer to allow cells to grow in the culture wells. When the waveguide is illuminated, the surface of the quartz slide propagates light such that the photosensitive polymer is evenly irradiated and generates NO across the surface of the cell culture well and no light penetrates into the volume of the wells where cells are growing. Mouse smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) were grown in the system in a proof of principle experiment, whereby 60% of the cells were present in the NO-releasing well compared to control wells after 17\u00a0h. The compelling advantage of illuminating the NO-releasing polymers with the waveguide system is that light can be used to tunably control NO release while avoiding exposing cells to optical radiation. This device provides means to quantitatively control the surface flux, timing and duration of NO cells experience and allows for systematic study of cellular response to NO generated at the cell/surface interface in a wide variety of studies.",

We hypothesized that estrogens may also influence circulating redox balance by regulating activity of the cellular antioxidative enzyme system. We aimed to explore the impact of surgical estrogen deprivation and replacement (ERT) on the glutathione balance and antioxidant enzymes expression in fertile women.Nineteen healthy premenopausal women who underwent total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were evaluated at baseline, 30 days after surgery without ERT and 30 days after ERT. Redox balance was determined by measuring blood reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione, as well as the GSSG/GSH ratio. Antioxidant status was evaluated by measuring serum estrogen (E2) levels and mRNA expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Serum E2 significantly lowered after surgery, and increased in 12 out of 19 patients after 30 days of ERT (Responders). In such patients, an increase in oxidative stress was observed after surgery that resolved after ERT. Oxidative stress was sustained by reduction in the mRNA expression of both SOD and GSH-Px, that recovered after 30 days of therapy in responders. CAT and GST mRNA expression were not modified by surgery and replacement therapy.Menopause is associated with significant change in antioxidant gene expression that in turn affects circulating redox state. Estrogens replacement therapy is able to prevent and counteract such modifications by acting as regulators of key antioxidant gene expression. These findings suggest that antioxidant genes are, almost in part, under the control of sex hormones, and that pathophysiology of the difference in gender disease may depend on the redox biology.",

Here, we address how H2O2 achieves this molecular specificity. HeLa and MCF-7 cells were exposed to steady-state H2O2 and/or TNF-\u03b1 and levels of c-Rel, p65, I\u03baB-\u03b1, I\u03baB-\u03b2 and I\u03baB-\u03b5 were determined. For an extracellular concentration of 25\u00a0\u00b5M H2O2, the intracellular H2O2 concentration is 3.7\u00a0\u00b5M and 12.5\u00a0\u00b5M for respectively HeLa and MCF-7 cells. The higher cytosolic H2O2 concentration present in MCF-7 cells may be a contributing factor for the higher activation of NF-\u03baB caused by H2O2 in this cell line, when compared to HeLa cells. In both cells lines, H2O2 precludes the recovery of TNF-\u03b1-dependent I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation, which may explain the observed synergism between H2O2 and TNF-\u03b1 concerning p65 nuclear translocation. In MCF-7 cells, H2O2, in the presence of TNF-\u03b1, tripled the induction of c-Rel triggered either by TNF-\u03b1 or H2O2. Conversely, in HeLa cells, H2O2 had a small antagonistic effect on TNF-\u03b1-induced c-Rel nuclear levels, concomitantly with a 50 % induction of I\u03baB-\u03b5, the preferential inhibitor protein of c-Rel dimers. The 6-fold higher c-Rel/I\u03baB-\u03b5 ratio found in MCF-7 cells when compared with HeLa cells, may be a contributing factor for the cell-type dependent modulation of c-Rel by H2O2.Our results suggest that H2O2 might have an important cell-type specific role in the regulation of c-Rel-dependent processes, e.g. cancer or wound healing.",

It is unresolved whether the cytoprotective and metabolic responses mediated by Nrf2 are connected or separable events in non-malignant cells. In this study we show that activation of Nrf2, either by the small molecule sulforaphane or knockout of the Nrf2 inhibitor Keap1, leads to increased cellular glucose uptake and increased glucose addiction in fibroblasts. Upon Nrf2 activation glucose is preferentially metabolized through the pentose phosphate pathway with increased production of NADPH. Interference with the supply of glucose or the pentose phosphate pathway and NADPH generation not only hampers Nrf2-mediated detoxification of reactive oxygen species on the enzyme level but also Nrf2-initiated expression of antioxidant defense proteins, such as glutathione reductase and heme-oxygenase1. We conclude that the Nrf2-dependent protection against oxidative stress relies on an intact pentose phosphate pathway and that there is crosstalk between metabolism and detoxification already at the level of gene expression in mammalian cells.",

     "abstract": "Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is an abundant protein primarily found in the endoplasmic reticulum and also secreted into the blood by a variety of vascular cells. The evidence obtained here, suggests that PDI could directly participate in the efflux of NO+ from red blood cells (RBC). PDI was detected both in RBC membranes and in the cytosol. PDI was S-nitrosylated when RBCs were exposed to nitrite under \u223c50% oxygen saturation but not under \u223c100% oxygen saturation. Furthermore, it was observed that hemoglobin (Hb) could promote PDI S-nitrosylation in the presence of \u223c600\u00a0nM nitrite. In addition, three lines of evidence were obtained for PDI\u2013Hb interactions: (1) Hb co-immunoprecipitated with PDI; (2) Hb quenched the intrinsic PDI fluorescence in a saturable manner; and (3) Hb\u2013Fe(II)\u2013NO absorption spectrum decreased in a [PDI]-dependent manner. Finally, PDI was detected on the surface RBC under \u223c100% oxygen saturation and released as soluble under \u223c50% oxygen saturation. The soluble PDI detected under \u223c50% oxygen saturation was S-nitrosylated. Based on these data it is proposed that PDI is taken up by RBC and forms a complex with Hb. Hb\u2013Fe(II)\u2013NO that is formed from nitrite reduction under \u223c50% O2, then transfers NO+ to either Hb\u2013Cys \u03b293 or directly to PDI resulting in S-nitroso-PDI which transverses the RBC membrane and attaches to the RBC surface. When RBCs enter tissues the S-nitroso-PDI is released from the RBC-surface into the blood where its NO+ is transferred into the endothelium thereby inducing vasodilation, suggesting local oxygen-dependent dynamic interplays between nitrite, NO and S-nitrosylation.",

Alteration in these plasma redox nodes significantly affects cellular physiology, and oxidation of the plasma Cys/CySS redox potential (EhCySS) is associated with aging and disease risk in humans. The purpose of this study was to determine age-related changes in plasma redox metabolites and corresponding redox potentials (Eh) to further validate the marmoset as a nonhuman primate model of aging. We measured plasma thiol redox states in marmosets and used existing human data with multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) to model the relationships between age and redox metabolites. A classification accuracy of 70.2% and an AUC of 0.703 were achieved using the MARS model built from the marmoset redox data to classify the human samples as young or old.

     "abstract": "Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive, inherited neuro- and cardio-degenerative disorder characterized by progressive ataxia of all four limbs, dysarthria, areflexia, sensory loss, skeletal deformities, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Most disease alleles have a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first intron of the FXN gene, which decreases expression of the encoded protein frataxin. Frataxin is involved in iron\u2013sulfur-cluster (ISC) assembly in the mitochondrial matrix, and decreased frataxin is associated with ISC-enzyme and mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial iron accumulation, and increased oxidative stress. To assess the role of oxidative stress in lipid peroxidation in Friedreich ataxia we used the novel approach of treating Friedreich ataxia cell models with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) deuterated at bis-allylic sites. In ROS-driven oxidation of PUFAs, the rate-limiting step is hydrogen abstraction from a bis-allylic site; isotopic reinforcement (deuteration) of bis-allylic sites slows down their peroxidation. We show that linoleic and \u03b1-linolenic acids deuterated at the peroxidation-prone bis-allylic positions actively rescue oxidative-stress-challenged Friedreich ataxia cells. The protective effect of the deuterated PUFAs is additive in our models with the protective effect of the CoQ10 analog idebenone, which is thought to decrease the production of free radicals. Moreover, the administration of deuterated PUFAs resulted in decreased lipid peroxidation as measured by the fluorescence of the fatty acid analog C11-BODIPY (581/591) probe. Our results are consistent with a role for lipid peroxidation in Friedreich ataxia pathology, and suggest that the novel approach of oral delivery of isotope-reinforced PUFAs may have therapeutic potential in Friedreich ataxia and other disorders involving oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are a major source of cellular oxidants and have been implicated in aging and associated pathologies, notably cardiovascular diseases. Vascular cell senescence is observed in experimental and human cardiovascular pathologies. Our previous data highlighted a role for angiotensin II in the induction of telomere-dependent and -independent premature senescence of human vascular smooth muscle cells and suggested this was due to production of superoxide by NADPH oxidase. However, since a role for mitochondrial oxidants was not ruled out we hypothesise that angiotensin II mediates senescence by mitochondrial superoxide generation and suggest that inhibition of superoxide may prevent vascular smooth muscle cell aging in vitro. Cellular senescence was induced using a stress-induced premature senescence protocol consisting of three successive once-daily exposure of cells to 1\u00d710\u22128\u00a0mol/L angiotensin II and was dependent upon the type-1 angiotensin II receptor. Angiotensin stimulated NADPH-dependent superoxide production as estimated using lucigenin chemiluminescence in cell lysates and this was attenuated by the mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibitor, rotenone. Angiotensin also resulted in an increase in mitoSOX fluorescence indicating stimulation of mitochondrial superoxide. Significantly, the induction of senescence by angiotensin II was abrogated by rotenone and by the mitochondria-targeted superoxide dismutase mimetic, mitoTEMPO. These data suggest that mitochondrial superoxide is necessary for the induction of stress-induced premature senescence by angiotensin II and taken together with other data suggest that mitochondrial cross-talk with NADPH oxidases, via as yet unidentified signalling pathways, is likely to play a key role.",

Here we explore of the hypothesis that Nrf2 activation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species modulates cytotoxicity during hypoxia (H) with and without reoxygenation (H/R) in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts. Using MnTBap as a cell permeable superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic and peroxynitrite scavenger and L-NAME as an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), we have shown that MnTBap inhibited the cytotoxic effects of hypoxic stress with and without reoxygenation. However, L-NAME only afforded protection during H. Under reoxygenation, conditions, cytotoxicity was increased by the presence of L-NAME. Nrf2 activation was inhibited independently by MnTBap and L-NAME under H and H/R. The increased cytotoxicity and inhibition of Nrf2 activation by the presence of L-NAME during reoxygenation suggests that NOS activity plays an important role in cell survival at least in part via Nrf2-independent pathways. In contrast, O2\u2212\u2022 scavenging by MnTBap prevented both toxicity and Nrf2 activation during H and H/R implying that toxicity is largely dependent on O2\u2212.To confirm the importance of Nrf2 for myoblast metabolism, Nrf2 knockdown with siRNA reduced cell survival by 50% during 4\u00a0h hypoxia with and without 2\u00a0h of reoxygenation and although cellular glutathione (GSH) was depleted during H and H/R, GSH loss was not exacerbated by Nrf2 knockdown. These data support distinctive roles for ROS and RNS during H and H/R for Nrf2 induction which are important for survival independently of GSH salvage.",

     "abstract": "Mouse cytochrome P450 2A5 (CYP2A5) is upregulated in various liver diseases and a putative common feature for all of these conditions is altered cellular redox status. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that is post-translationally regulated by oxidative stress and controls the transcription of protective target genes. In the present study, we have characterized the regulation of CYP2A5 by Nrf2 and evaluated gene expression, protein content and activity of anti-oxidant enzymes in the Nrf2+/+ and Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice model of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). After eight weeks of feeding on a high-fat diet, livers from Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice showed a substantial increase in macro and microvesicular steatosis and a massive increase in the number of neutrophil polymorphs, compared to livers from wild-type mice treated similarly. Livers of Nrf2\u2212/\u2212 mice on the high-fat diet exhibited more oxidative stress than their wild-type counterparts as assessed by a significant depletion of reduced glutathione that was coupled with increases in malondialdehyde. Furthermore, results in Nrf2-deficient mice showed that CYP2A5 expression was significantly attenuated in the absence of Nrf2, as was found with the conventional target genes of Nrf2. The treatment of wild-type mice with high-fat diet leaded to nuclear accumulation of Nrf2, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Nrf2 was bound to Cyp2a5. These findings suggest that the high-fat diet induced alteration in cellular redox status and induction of CYP2A5 was modulated through the redox-sensitive transcription Nrf2.",

     "abstract": "Neurons rely on the release and subsequent cleavage of GSH to cysteinylglycine (CysGly) by astrocytes in order to maintain optimal intracellular GSH levels. In neurodegenerative diseases characterised by oxidative stress, neurons need an optimal GSH supply to defend themselves against free radicals released from activated microglia and astroglia. The rate of GSH synthesis is controlled largely by the activity of \u03b3-glutamyl cysteine ligase. Expression of \u03b3-glutamyl cysteine ligase and of the Xc- system, which facilitates cystine uptake, is regulated by the redox-sensitive transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Compounds that can activate the Nrf2-ARE pathway, referred to as \u2018Nrf2 activators\u2019 are receiving growing attention due to their potential as GSH-boosting drugs.This study compares four known Nrf2 activators, R-\u03b1-Lipoic acid (LA), tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), sulforaphane (SFN) and Polygonum cuspidatum extract containing 50% resveratrol (PC-Res) for their effects on astroglial release of GSH and CysGly. GSH levels increased dose-dependently in response to all four drugs. Sulforaphane produced the most potent effect, increasing GSH by up to 2.4-fold. PC-Res increased GSH up to 1.6-fold, followed by TBHQ (1.5-fold) and LA (1.4-fold). GSH is processed by the ectoenzyme, \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, to form CysGly. Once again, SFN produced the most potent effect, increasing CysGly by up to 1.7-fold, compared to control cells. TBHQ and PC-Res both induced fold increases of 1.3, followed by LA with a fold increase of 1.2. The results from the present study showed that sulforaphane, followed by lipoic acid, resveratrol and Polygonum multiflorum were all identified as potent \u201cGSH and Cys-Gly boosters\u201d.",

We hypothesized that the cellular response in presence of high oxygen concentration might be particularly important in studies comparing energetic function or oxidative stress in cells isolated from young versus old animals. To test this, we asked whether oxygen tension plays a role in mitochondrial bioenergetics (oxygen consumption, glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation) or oxidative damage to proteins (protein disulfides, carbonyls and aggregates) in myoblast precursor cells (MPCs) isolated from young (3\u20134\u00a0m) and old (29\u201330\u00a0m) C57BL/6 mice. MPCs were grown under physiological (3%) or ambient (21%) O2 for two weeks prior to exposure to an acute oxidative insult (H2O2). Our results show significantly higher basal mitochondrial respiration in young versus old MPCs, an increase in basal respiration in young MPCs maintained at 3% O2 compared to cells maintained at 21% O2, and a shift toward glycolytic metabolism in old MPCs grown at 21% O2. H2O2 treatment significantly reduced respiration in old MPCs grown at 3% O2 but did not further repress respiration at 21% O2 in old MPCs. Oxidative damage to protein was higher in cells maintained at 21% O2 and increased in response to H2O2 in old MPCs. These data underscore the importance of understanding the effect of ambient oxygen tension in cell culture studies, in particular studies measuring oxidative damage and mitochondrial function.",

The most studied product of DNA oxidation is 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG). While 8-oxodG determination in blood and tissue cells is prone to artifacts, its measurement in urine employing liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) has gained more and more interest for increased reliability. LC-MS/MS can be affected by matrix effects and this is particularly true when ion trap is used as MS analyzer, due to ion accumulation in the trap and related space charge effect. In the present work, we have developed a LC-MS/MS method where the combination of cation exchange and reverse phase solid phases resulted in LC separation optimization. This together with the employment of an isotopically labeled internal standard, allowed the usage of ion trap LC-MS/MS, typically not employed for quantitative measurement in biological samples, for the measurement of 8-oxodG in urine samples from control populations.Four different urine matrices were employed for method validation. Limit of quantitation was set at least at 0.5\u00a0ng/ml. While analyzing urine samples from healthy volunteers, 8-oxodG levels reported as ng/ml were statistically different comparing males with females (p<0.05, Mann Whitney test); while comparing results normalized for creatinine no statistical significant difference was found. Mean urinary 8-oxodG level found in healthy volunteers was 1.16\u00b10.46\u00a0nmol/mmol creatinine.The present method by enhancing at best the chromatographic performances allows the usage of ion trap LC-MS/MS for the measurement of 8-oxodG in urine samples from control populations.",

We previously reported that Immp2l mutation in mice causes excessive mitochondrial superoxide generation, which causes infertility and early signs of aging. In our present study, reduced food intake in mutant mice resulted in significantly reduced body weight and fat composition while energy expenditure remained unchanged.

Muscle biopsies from calf soleus and hip vastus lateralis were harvested at start (Pre) and at end (End) from a bed rest disuse control group (CTR, n=9) and two bed rest resistive exercise groups either without (RE, n=7) or with superimposed vibration stimuli (RVE, n=7). At subcellular compartments, strong anti-SNO-Cys immunofluorescence patterns in control muscle fibers after bed rest returned to baseline following vibration exercise. Total SNO-protein levels, Nrf-2 gene expression and nucleocytoplasmic shuttling were changed to varying degrees in all groups. Excess SNO-protein levels of specific calcium release/uptake proteins (SNO-RyR1, \u2013SERCA1 and \u2013PMCA) and of contractile myosin heavy chains seen in biopsy samples of chronically disused skeletal muscle were largely reduced by vibration exercise. We also identified NOS1 as a novel NO target in human skeletal muscle controlled by activity driven auto-nitrosylation mechanisms. Our findings suggest that aberrant levels of functional SNO-proteins represent signatures of uncontrolled nitrosative stress management in disused human skeletal muscle that can be offset by exercise as countermeasure.",

Oxidative stress and inflammation in CKD are associated with and, in part, due to impaired activity of the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2. RTA dh404 is a synthetic oleanane triterpenoid compound which potently activates Nrf2 and inhibits the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-\u03baB. This study was designed to test the effects of RTA dh404 on endothelial function, inflammation, and the Nrf2-mediated antioxidative system in the aorta of rats with CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy. Sham-operated rats served as controls. Subgroups of CKD rats were treated orally with RTA dh404 (2\u00a0mg/kg/day) or vehicle for 12 weeks. The aortic rings from untreated CKD rats exhibited a significant reduction in the acetylcholine-induced relaxation response which was restored by RTA dh404 administration. Impaired endothelial function in the untreated CKD rats was accompanied by significant reduction of Nrf2 activity (nuclear translocation) and expression of its cytoprotective target genes, as well as accumulation of nitrotyrosine and upregulation of NAD(P)H oxidases, 12-lipoxygenase, MCP-1, and angiotensin II receptors in the aorta. These abnormalities were ameliorated by RTA dh404 administration, as demonstrated by the full or partial restoration of the expression of all the above analytes to sham control levels. Collectively, the data demonstrate that endothelial dysfunction in rats with CKD induced by 5/6 nephrectomy is associated with impaired Nrf2 activity in arterial tissue, which can be reversed with long term administration of RTA dh404.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation is a causative factor in skin photocarcinogenesis and photoaging, and an urgent need exists for improved strategies for skin photoprotection. The redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2 (nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2), a master regulator of the cellular antioxidant defense against environmental electrophilic insult, has recently emerged as an important determinant of cutaneous damage from solar UV, and the concept of pharmacological activation of Nrf2 has attracted considerable attention as a novel approach to skin photoprotection. In this study, we examined feasibility of using tanshinones, a novel class of phenanthrenequinone-based cytoprotective Nrf2 inducers derived from the medicinal plant Salvia miltiorrhiza, for protection of cultured human skin cells and reconstructed human skin against solar simulated UV. Using a dual luciferase reporter assay in human Hs27 dermal fibroblasts pronounced transcriptional activation of Nrf2 by four major tanshinones [tanshinone I (T-I), dihydrotanshinone (DHT), tanshinone IIA (T-II-A) and cryptotanshinone (CT)] was detected. In fibroblasts, the more potent tanshinones T-I and DHT caused a significant increase in Nrf2 protein half-life via blockage of ubiquitination, ultimately resulting in upregulated expression of cytoprotective Nrf2 target genes (GCLC, NQO1) with the elevation of cellular glutathione levels. Similar tanshinone-induced changes were also observed in HaCaT keratinocytes. T-I and DHT pretreatment caused significant suppression of skin cell death induced by solar simulated UV and riboflavin-sensitized UVA. Moreover, feasibility of tanshinone-based cutaneous photoprotection was tested employing a human skin reconstruct exposed to solar simulated UV (80\u00a0mJ/cm2 UVB; 1.53\u00a0J/cm2 UVA). The occurrence of markers of epidermal solar insult (cleaved procaspase 3, pycnotic nuclei, eosinophilic cytoplasm, acellular cavities) was significantly attenuated in DHT-treated reconstructs that displayed increased immunohistochemical staining for Nrf2 and \u03b3-GCS together with the elevation of total glutathione levels. Taken together, our data suggest the feasibility of achieving tanshinone-based cutaneous Nrf2-activation and photoprotection.",

     "abstract": "Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) develop a highly proliferative and synthetic phenotype in arterial diseases. Because such phenotypic changes are likely integrated with the energetic state of the cell, we hypothesized that changes in cellular metabolism regulate VSMC plasticity. VSMCs were exposed to platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) and changes in mitochondrial morphology, proliferation, contractile protein expression, and mitochondrial metabolism were examined. Exposure of VSMCs to PDGF resulted in mitochondrial fragmentation and a 50% decrease in the abundance of mitofusin 2. Synthetic VSMCs demonstrated a 20% decrease in glucose oxidation, which was accompanied by an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Results of mitochondrial function assays in permeabilized cells showed few changes due to PDGF treatment in mitochondrial respiratory chain capacity and coupling. Treatment of VSMCs with Mdivi-1\u2014an inhibitor of mitochondrial fission\u2014inhibited PDGF-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by 50% and abolished increases in cell proliferation; however, it failed to prevent PDGF-mediated activation of autophagy and removal of contractile proteins. In addition, treatment with Mdivi-1 reversed changes in fatty acid and glucose oxidation associated with the synthetic phenotype. These results suggest that changes in mitochondrial morphology and bioenergetics underlie the hyperproliferative features of the synthetic VSMC phenotype, but do not affect the degradation of contractile proteins. Mitochondrial fragmentation occurring during the transition to the synthetic phenotype could be a therapeutic target for hyperproliferative vascular disorders.",

     "abstract": "Autophagy has been shown to be protective against drug and alcohol-induced liver injury. CYP2E1 plays a role in the toxicity of ethanol, carcinogens and certain drugs. Inhibition of autophagy increased ethanol-toxicity and accumulation of fat in wild type and CYP2E1 knockin mice but not in CYP2E1 knockout mice as well as in HepG2 cells expressing CYP2E1 (E47 cells) but not HepG2 cells lacking CYP2E1 (C34 cells). The goal of the current study was to evaluate whether modulation of autophagy can affect CYP2E1-dependent cytotoxicity in the E47 cells. The agents used to promote CYP2E1 \u2013dependent toxicity were a polyunsaturated fatty acid, arachidonic acid (AA), buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), which depletes GSH, and CCl4, which is metabolized to the CCl3 radical. These three agents produced a decrease in E47 cell viability which was enhanced upon inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or Atg 7 siRNA. Toxicity was lowered by rapamycin which increased autophagy and was much lower to the C34 cells which do not express CYP2E1. Toxicity was mainly necrotic and was associated with an increase in reactive oxygen production and oxidative stress; 3-MA increased while rapamycin blunted the oxidative stress. The enhanced toxicity and ROS formation produced when autophagy was inhibited was prevented by the antioxidant N-Acetyl cysteine. AA, BSO and CCl4 produced mitochondrial dysfunction, lowered cellular ATP levels and elevated mitochondrial production of ROS. This mitochondrial dysfunction was enhanced by inhibition of autophagy with 3-MA but decreased when autophagy was increased by rapamycin. The mitogen activated protein kinases p38 MAPK and JNK were activated by AA especially when autophagy was inhibited and chemical inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JNK lowered the elevated toxicity of AA produced by 3-MA. These results show that autophagy was protective against the toxicity produced by several agents known to be activated by CYP2E1. Since CYP2E1 plays an important role in the toxicity of ethanol, drugs and carcinogens and is activated under various pathophysiological conditions such as diabetes, NASH and obesity, attempts to stimulate autophagy may be beneficial in preventing/lowering CYP2E1/ethanol liver injury.",

     "abstract": "Mammalian lipoxygenases play a role in normal cell development and differentiation but they have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular, hyperproliferative and neurodegenerative diseases. As lipid peroxidizing enzymes they are involved in the regulation of cellular redox homeostasis since they produce lipid hydroperoxides, which serve as an efficient source for free radicals. There are various epidemiological correlation studies relating naturally occurring variations in the six human lipoxygenase genes (SNPs or rare mutations) to the frequency for various diseases in these individuals, but for most of the described variations no functional data are available. Employing a combined bioinformatical and enzymological strategy, which included structural modeling and experimental site-directed mutagenesis, we systematically explored the structural and functional consequences of non-synonymous genetic variations in four different human lipoxygenase genes (ALOX5, ALOX12, ALOX15, and ALOX15B) that have been identified in the human 1000 genome project. Due to a lack of a functional expression system we resigned to analyze the functionality of genetic variations in the hALOX12B and hALOXE3 gene. We found that most of the frequent non-synonymous coding SNPs are located at the enzyme surface and hardly alter the enzyme functionality. In contrast, genetic variations which affect functional important amino acid residues or lead to truncated enzyme variations (nonsense mutations) are usually rare with a global allele frequency<0.1%. This data suggest that there appears to be an evolutionary pressure on the coding regions of the lipoxygenase genes preventing the accumulation of loss-of-function variations in the human population.",

While nitrite is as a major vascular storage pool and source of NO, little is known about drugs that increase tissue nitrite concentrations. This study examined the effects of atorvastatin or sildenafil, or the combination, on vascular nitrite concentrations and on endothelial dysfunction in the 2 kidney-1 clip (2K1C) hypertension model. Sham-operated or 2K1C hypertensive rats were treated with vehicle, atorvastatin (50\u00a0mg/Kg), sildenafil (45\u00a0mg/Kg), or both for 8 weeks. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored weekly. Nitrite concentrations were assessed in the aortas and in plasma samples by ozone-based reductive chemiluminescence assay. Aortic rings were isolated to assess endothelium-dependent and independent relaxation. Aortic NADPH activity and ROS production were evaluated by luminescence and dihydroethidium, respectively, and plasma TBARS levels were measured. Aortic nitrotyrosine staining was evaluated to assess peroxynitrite formation. Atorvastatin and sildenafil, alone or combined, significantly lowered SBP by approximately 40\u00a0mmHg. Atorvastatin significantly increased vascular nitrite levels by 70% in hypertensive rats, whereas sildenafil had no effects. Both drugs significantly improved the vascular function, and decreased vascular NADPH activity, ROS, and nitrotyrosine levels. Lower plasma TBARS concentrations were found with both treatments. The combination of drugs showed no improved responses compared to each drug alone. These findings show evidence that atorvastatin, but not sildenafil, increases vascular NO stores, although both drugs exert antioxidant effects, improve endothelial function, and lower blood pressure in 2K1C hypertension.",

     "abstract": "Clinical and animal studies have documented that hearts of the elderly are more susceptible to ischemia/reperfusion damage compared to young adults. Recently we found that aging-dependent increase in susceptibility of cardiomyocytes to apoptosis was attributable to decrease in cytosolic glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1) and concomitant decrease in NF-\u03baB-mediated expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Besides primary localization in the cytosol, Grx1 also exists in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS). In contrast, Grx2 is confined to the mitochondrial matrix. Here we report that Grx1 is decreased by 50\u201360% in the IMS, but Grx2 is increased by 1.4\u20132.6 fold in the matrix of heart mitochondria from elderly rats. Determination of in situ activities of the Grx isozymes from both subsarcolemmal (SSM) and interfibrillar (IFM) mitochondria revealed that Grx1 was fully active in the IMS. However, Grx2 was mostly in an inactive form in the matrix, consistent with reversible sequestration of the active-site cysteines of two Grx2 molecules in complex with an iron\u2013sulfur cluster. Our quantitative evaluations of the active/inactive ratio for Grx2 suggest that levels of dimeric Grx2 complex with iron\u2013sulfur clusters are increased in SSM and IFM in the hearts of elderly rats. We found that the inactive Grx2 can be fully reactivated by sodium dithionite or exogenous superoxide production mediated by xanthine oxidase. However, treatment with rotenone, which generates intramitochondrial superoxide through inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory chain Complex I, did not lead to Grx2 activation. These findings suggest that insufficient ROS accumulates in the vicinity of dimeric Grx2 to activate it in situ.",

Several Mn(III) porphyrin-based superoxide dismutase mimics have been synthesized and successfully evaluated in preclinical models as radioprotectants. Here we report for the first time the remarkable rectal radioprotection of frequently explored Mn(III) meso-tetrakis(N-ethylpyridinium-2-yl)porphyrin, MnTE-2-PyP5+. A batch prepared in compliance with good manufacturing practice (GMP), which has good safety/toxicity profile, was used for this study. MnTE-2-PyP5+ was given subcutaneously at 5\u00a0mg/kg, either 1\u00a0h before or 1\u00a0h after irradiation, with additional drug administered at weekly intervals thereafter. MnTE-2-PyP5+ ameliorated both acute and chronic radiation proctitis in male Sprague-Dawley rats irradiated with 20\u201330\u00a0Gy protons delivered to 2.5\u00a0cm span of rectum using spread-out Bragg peak of a proton treatment beam. Focal irradiation of the rectum produced acute proctitis, which healed, followed by chronic rectal dilation and symptomatic proctitis. MnTE-2-PyP5+ protected rectal mucosa from radiation-induced crypt loss measured 10 days post-irradiation. Significant effects were observed with both pre- and post-treatment regimens. However, only MnTE-2-PyP5+ pre-treatment, but not post-treatment, prevented the development of rectal dilation, indicating that proper dosing regimen is critical for radioprotection. The pre-treatment also prevented or delayed the development of chronic proctitis depending on the radiation dose. Further work aimed at developing MnTE-2-PyP5+ and similar drugs as adjunctive agents for radiotherapy of pelvic tumors is warranted. The present study substantiates the prospects of employing this and similar analogs in preserving normal tissue during cancer radiation as well as any other radiation exposure.",

In addition, the enzyme reacts with hydrogen peroxide in a peroxidase reaction which is known to disrupt enzymatic activity.

Analyses by peptide mapping and mass spectrometry shows that oxidation of Pro112 supports the cleavage of the Pro112\u2013His113 peptide bond. Substitution of Ala for Pro112 did not inhibit fragmentation, indicating that the oxidative fragmentation at this position is dictated by spatial organization and not by side-chain specificity. The major part of EC-SOD inhibited by the peroxidase reaction was not fragmented but found to encompass oxidations of histidine residues involved in the coordination of copper (His98 and His163). These oxidations are likely to support the dissociation of copper from the active site and thus loss of enzymatic activity. Homologous modifications have also been described for the intracellular isozyme, Cu/Zn-SOD, reflecting the almost identical structures of the active site within these enzymes. We speculate that the inactivation of EC-SOD by peroxidase activity plays a role in regulating SOD activity in vivo, as even low levels of superoxide will allow for the peroxidase reaction to occur.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of three pathological hallmarks: synapse loss, extracellular senile plaques (SP) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The major component of SP is amyloid \u03b2-peptide (A\u03b2), which has been shown to induce oxidative stress. The AD brain shows increased levels of lipid peroxidation products, including 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE). HNE can react covalently with Cys, His, or Lys residues on proteins, altering structure and function of the latter. In the present study we measured the levels of the HNE-modified lipoic acid in brain of subjects with AD and age-matched controls. Lipoic acid is a key co-factor for a number of proteins including pyruvate dehydrogenase and \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, key complexes for cellular energetics. We observed a significant decrease in the levels of HNE-lipoic acid in the AD brain compared to that of age-matched controls. To investigate this phenomenon further, the levels and activity of lipoamide dehydrogenase (LADH) were measured in AD and control brains. Additionally, LADH activities were measured after in-vitro HNE-treatment to mice brains. Both LADH levels and activities were found to be significantly reduced in AD brain compared to age-matched control. HNE-treatment also reduced the LADH activity in mice brain. These data are consistent with a two-hit hypothesis of AD: oxidative stress leads to lipid peroxidation that, in turn, causes oxidative dysfunction of key energy-related complexes in mitochondria, triggering neurodegeneration. This study is consonant with the notion that lipoic acid supplementation could be a potential treatment for the observed loss of cellular energetics in AD and potentiate the antioxidant defense system to prevent or delay the oxidative stress in and progression of this devastating dementing disorder.",
