     "abstract": "Frailty has been identified as a risk factor for mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the association between frailty and all-cause mortality outcome in patients with ACS.Pubmed and Embase databases were searched up to September 26, 2018 for the observational studies evaluating the association between frailty and all-cause mortality in elderly ACS patients. Outcome measures were in-hospital death, short-term all-cause mortality (\u22646 months),and long-term all-cause mortality (\u226512 months).The impact of frailty on all-cause mortality was summarized as hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the frail versus nonfrail patients.A total of 9 cohort studies involving 2475 elderly ACS patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that ACS patients with frailty had an increased risk of in-hospital death (HR 5.49; 95% CI 2.19\u201313.77), short-term all-cause mortality (HR 3.56; 95% CI 1.96\u20136.48), and long-term all-cause mortality (HR 2.44; 95% CI 1.92\u20133.12) after adjustment for confounding factors. In addition, prefrailty was also associated with an increased all-cause mortality (HR 1.65; 95% CI 1.01\u20132.69).This meta-analysis demonstrates that frailty independently predicts all-cause mortality in elderly ACS patients. Elderly ACS patients should be assessed the frailty status for improving risk stratification.",

     "abstract": "There is growing evidence that loneliness is associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. However, the extent of this association remains unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies examining this association was conducted. Six electronic databases were searched from inception to November 15th 2018. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed to obtain pooled estimates and 95% CIs. Studies were also assessed for heterogeneity, methodological quality and publication bias. A total of 4270 hits were retrieved based on the initial search strategy and ten studies met the eligibility criteria involving 37339 individuals (mean age from 64.9 to 83.1 years). Variation between studies was present for the measurement of loneliness as well as for the case ascertainment of MCI and dementia. Loneliness was positively associated with increased risk of dementia (overall RR\u2009=\u20091.26; 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.14, 1.40; n\u2009=\u20098). Due to lack of sufficient data, we could not explore the association between loneliness and risk of MCI through a meta-analysis, but limited evidence suggests a potential effect of loneliness on MCI. A further understanding of the deleterious effects of loneliness on MCI and dementia may assist the design of environmental and psychological interventions to prevent or delay the onset of these neuropsychiatric conditions.",

     "abstract": "Fibrosis is universally observed in multiple aging-related diseases and progressions and is characterized by excess accumulation of the extracellular matrix. Fibrosis occurs in various human organs and eventually results in organ failure. Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as essential regulators of cellular signaling and relevant human diseases. In particular, the enigmatic class of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is a kind of noncoding RNA that is longer than 200 nucleotides and does not possess protein coding ability. LncRNAs have been identified to exert both promotive and inhibitory effects on the multifaceted processes of fibrosis. A growing body of studies has revealed that lncRNAs are involved in fibrosis in various organs, including the liver, heart, lung, and kidney. As lncRNAs have been increasingly identified, they have become promising targets for anti-fibrosis therapies. This review systematically highlights the recent advances regarding the roles of lncRNAs in fibrosis and sheds light on the use of lncRNAs as a potential treatment for fibrosis.",

     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to map and grade evidence for the relationships between telomere length with a diverse range of health outcomes, using an umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analyses. We searched for meta-analyses of observational studies reporting on the association of telomere length with any health outcome (clinical disease outcomes and intermediate traits). For each association, random-effects summary effect size, 95% confidence interval (CI), and 95% prediction interval were calculated. To evaluate the credibility of the identified evidence, we assessed also heterogeneity, evidence for small-study effect and evidence for excess significance bias. Twenty-one relevant meta-analyses were identified reporting on 50 different outcomes. The level of evidence was high only for the association of short telomeres with higher risk of gastric cancer in the general population (relative risk, RR\u2009=\u20091.95, 95%CI: 1.68\u20132.26), and moderate for the association of shorter telomeres with diabetes or with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, even if limited to meta-analyses of case-control studies. There was weak evidence for twenty outcomes and not significant association for 27 health outcomes. The present umbrella review demonstrates that shorter telomere length may have an important role in incidence gastric cancer and, probably, diabetes and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. At the same time, conversely to general assumptions, it does not find strong evidence supporting the notion that shorter telomere length plays an important role in many health outcomes that have been studied thus far.",

     "abstract": "A healthy functioning immune system is critical to stave off infectious diseases, but as humans and other organisms age, their immune systems decline. As a result, diseases that were readily thwarted in early life pose nontrivial harm and can even be deadly in late life. Immunosenescence is defined as the general deterioration of the immune system with age, and it is characterized by functional changes in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and specific blood cell types as well as changes in levels of numerous factors, particularly those involved in inflammation. Potential mechanisms underlying immunosenescence include epigenetic changes such as changes in DNA methylation (DNAm) and DNA hydroxymethylation (DNAhm) that occur with age. The purpose of this review is to describe what is currently known about the relationship between immunosenescence and the age-related changes to DNAm and DNAhm, and to discuss experimental approaches best suited to fill gaps in our understanding.",

     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "An appraisal of recent data highlighting aspects inspired by the new Geroscience perspective are here discussed. The main findings are summarized as follows: i) liver has to be considered an immunological organ, and new studies suggest a role for the recently described cells named telocytes; ii) the liver-gut axis represents a crucial connection with environment and life style habits and may influence liver diseases onset; iii) the physiological aging of liver shows relatively modest alterations. Nevertheless, several molecular changes appear to be relevant: a) an increase of microRNA-31-5p; -141-3p; -200c-3p expressions after 60 years of age; b) a remodeling of genome-wide DNA methylation profile evident until 60 years of age and then plateauing; c) changes in transcriptome including the metabolic zones of hepatocyte lobules; d) liver undergoes an accelerated aging in presence of chronic inflammation/liver diseases in a sort of continuum, largely as a consequence of unhealthy life styles and exposure to environmental noxious agents. We argue that chronic liver inflammation has all the major characteristics of \u201cinflammaging\u201d and likely sustains the onset and progression of liver diseases. Finally, we propose to use a combination of parameters, mostly obtained by omics such as transcriptomics and epigenomics, to evaluate in deep both the biological age of liver (in comparison with the chronological age) and the effects of donor-recipient age-mismatches in the context of liver transplant.",

To determine if cognitive activity is a precursor for WM plasticity, the available literature was systematically searched for Region of Interest (ROI) and whole-brain studies assessing the efficacy of cognitive training (CT) on WM microstructure using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) in healthy adults (> 40 years). Seven studies were identified and included in this review. Results suggest there are beneficial effects to WM microstructure after CT in frontal and medial brain regions, with some studies showing improved performance in cognitive outcomes. Benefits of CT were shown to be protective against age-related WM microstructure decline by either maintaining or improving WM after training. These results have implications for determining the capacity for training-dependent WM plasticity in older adults and whether CT can be utilised to prevent age-associated cognitive decline. Additional studies with standardised training and imaging protocols are needed to confirm these outcomes.",

     "abstract": "Malnutrition plays a role in the development of poor physical performance, frailty and sarcopenia. The use of nutritional supplementations for improving physical performance and muscle strength parameters in older people is unclear. We therefore aimed to summarize the effect of nutritional supplementations compared to placebo on physical performance (i.e. tests more investigating physical function, utilising aerobic capacity & muscle power) and muscle strength (i.e. tests depending on muscle power) outcomes in older people in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A literature search in major databases was undertaken until the 01st September 2018. Eligible studies were RCTs investigating the effect of nutritional supplementations vs. placebo in older people (people having an age >60 years). Standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used through a random effect model. Over 4007 potentially eligible articles, 32 RCTs for a total of 4137 older participants (2097 treated and 2040 placebo) (mean age: 76.3 years; 65% females) were included. Compared to placebo, multi-nutrient supplementations significantly improved chair rise time (n\u2009=\u20093; SMD=-0.90; 95%CI: -1.46 to -0.33; I2\u2009=\u200987%). Multi-nutrients significantly improved handgrip strength when compared to placebo (n\u2009=\u20096; 780 participants; SMD\u2009=\u20090.41; 95%CI: 0.06 to 0.76; I2\u2009=\u200979%), as did nutritional supplementations including protein (n\u2009=\u20097; 535 participants; SMD\u2009=\u20090.24; 95%CI: 0.07 to 0.41; I2\u2009=\u200916%).Nutritional supplementations also led to a significant improvement in chair rise time and in handgrip strength in participants affected by frailty/sarcopenia and in those affected by medical conditions. In conclusion, nutritional supplementation can improve a number of physical performance outcomes in older people, particularly when they include multi-nutrients and in people already affected by specific medical conditions, or by frailty/sarcopenia.",

Pooled relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted. The dose-response meta-analyses were conducted to assess potential linear and non-linear dose-response relations. Summary RRs and 95% CIs were calculated using a random- or fixed-effects model.Twenty-eight prospective cohort studies were eligible in this meta-analysis. During average follow-up periods ranging from 2.7 to 35 years there were 2557 cases (1035 all-cause dementia, 530 Alzheimer\u2019s disease, 92 vascular dementia and > 900 CIND) among 28,257 participants. There was a clear linear dose-response relationship between blood homocysteine concentration and risk of Alzheimer-type dementia (P\u2009>\u20090.05 for non-linearity). The pooled RR of Alzheimer-type dementia was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.26; I2\u2009=\u200956.6%, n\u2009=\u20095) for every 5\u2009\u03bcmol/L increase in blood homocysteine.

Due to the presence of publication bias and low statistical power, elevated levels of blood homocysteine were not appreciably associated with risk of all-cause, vascular dementia and CIND.Every 5\u2009\u03bcmol/L increase in blood homocysteine is linearly associated with a 15% increase in relative risk of Alzheimer-type dementia. This meta-analysis provides further evidence that a higher concentration of blood homocysteine is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer-type dementia.",

Given that protein aggregation is sufficient to activate stress-response and inflammation, impairing protein synthesis and quality control mechanisms, the former is assumed to negatively affect cellular metabolism and behaviour. In this review the state of the art in protein aggregation research is discussed, namely the relationship between pathology and proteostasis. The role of pathology and ageing in overriding protein quality-control mechanisms, and consequently, the effect of these faulty cellular processes on pathological and healthy ageing, are also addressed.",

     "abstract": "Population ageing is escalating rapidly now worldwide. This is an important time to determine if ageism or discrimination against older people is of concern, such as it being prevalent and/or increasing in prevalence. Over the years, many ageism measurement tools have been developed, with research findings from their use of prime consideration then for determining the prevalence of ageism and any prevalence trends. All print and open access English-language research articles published in 1953+ that used one or more ageism measurement tools in a study were sought using the Directory of Open Access Journals and EBSCO Discovery Service. A total of 25 ageism measurement tools were identified. However, only six had been used one or more times to measure the prevalence of ageism. The identified prevalence levels varied considerably, but most investigations using small convenience samples, with limited generalizability of findings. This paper highlights the need to continue developing ageism measurement tools to estimate ageism or use other measures, such as census and population-representative polling, to assess the extent and impact of ageism. This foundational measurement is needed, as ageism could be prevalent and growing in effect.",

     "abstract": "It\u2019s widely acknowledged that, as a neurodegenerative aging disease representing an intermediate stage between cognitive intactness and Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) poses an excessive burden on patients\u2019 well-being, family members, health-care providers as well as the whole society. This study focuses on three cognitive interventions proposed by Clare and Woods, which are, Cognitive stimulation (CS), Cognitive training (CT) and Cognitive rehabilitation (CR). Our Network meta-analysis (NMA) aims to compar them with one another to determine the optimal cognitive intervention for elderly adults with MCI in improving their cognitive function. We applied extensive strategies to preliminary literature retrieval to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which scrupulously compared any two of the three cognitive interventions with one another or any one of the three with a control group as the placebo or non-active group in treating elder patients with MCI in accordance with Petersen\u2019s criteria. Our NMA of cognitive interventions for patients diagnosed with MCI appraised the relative effectiveness of cognitive interventions across trials simultaneously. Our study attempts to summarize available data to suggest that CS (Mean difference [MD]\u2009=\u20090.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.27, 1.70) and CT (MD\u2009=\u20090.70, [CI]:0.11,1.30) were significantly beneficial to MCI patients for improving their cognition status while CR (MD\u2009=\u20090.59, [CI]:-0.30,1.50) scored lowest.

Standardised mean differences (SMDs) were calculated and results meta-analysed using random-effects models.

Compared to HCs, AD participants had increased TSPO levels throughout the brain (SMD range: 0.43\u20131.76), especially within fronto-temporal regions. MCI subjects also had increased TSPO levels, mainly within the neocortex, with more modest effects (SMD range: 0.46 - 0.90).

Here, we review previous work examining the role of physical activity in modulating levels of AD pathological hallmarks, beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) and tau (in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and blood). Robust evidence from transgenic animal studies suggests that physical activity (voluntary wheel running) and exercise (forced wheel running) are implicated in lowering levels of brain A\u03b2 and tau. Nevertheless, evidence from human studies, utilising measurements from positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, is less consistent.

Among them, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which are long transcripts without apparent protein-coding capacity, have received increasing interest for their involvement in a wide range of biological processes as regulatory molecules. Recent studies have suggested that lncRNAs play a role in AD pathogenesis, although their specific influences in the disorder remain to be largely unknown.Herein, we will summarize the biology and mechanisms of action of the best characterized dysregulated lncRNAs in AD, focusing the attention on their potential role in the disease pathogenesis. A deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the complex network of interactions in which they are implicated should open the doors to new research considering lncRNAs as novel therapeutic targets and prognostic/diagnostic biomarkers.",

     "abstract": "Telomeres, the terminal nucleoprotein structures of eukaryotic chromosomes, play pleiotropic functions in cellular and organismal aging. Telomere length (TL) varies throughout life due to the influence of genetic factors and to a complex balancing between \u201cshortening\u201d and \u201celongation\u201d signals. Telomerase, the only enzyme that can elongate a telomeric DNA chain, and telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), a long non-coding RNA involved in looping maintenance, play key roles in TL during life. Despite recent advances in the knowledge of TL, TERRA and telomerase activity (TA) biology and their measurement techniques, the experimental and theoretical issues involved raise a number of problems that should carefully be considered by researchers approaching the \u201ctelomere world\u201d. The increasing use of such parameters \u2013 hailed as promising clinically relevant biomarkers \u2013 has failed to be paralleled by the development of automated and standardized measurement technology. Consequently, associating given TL values to specific pathological conditions involves on the one hand technological issues and on the other clinical-biological issues related to the planning of clinically relevant association studies. Addressing these issues would help avoid major biases in association studies involving TL and a number of outcomes, especially those focusing on psychological and bio-behavioral variables. The main challenge in telomere research is the development of accurate and reliable measurement methods to achieve simple and sensitive TL, TERRA, and TA detection. The discovery of the localization of telomeres and TERRA in cellular and extracellular compartments had added an additional layer of complexity to the measurement of these age-related biomarkers. Since combined analysis of TL, TERRA and TA may well provide more exhaustive clinical information than a single parameter, we feel it is important for researchers in the various fields to become familiar with their most common measurement techniques and to be aware of the respective merits and drawbacks of these approaches.",

Defective efferocytosis is associated with several disease states, including cardiovascular disease and impaired immune surveillance, as occurs in cancer and autoimmune disease. A major cause of defective efferocytosis is non-functionality of surface receptors on either the phagocytic cells or the ACs, such as TAM family tyrosine kinase, which turns to a soluble form by cleavage/shedding or alternative splicing. Recently, soluble forms have featured prominently as potential biomarkers, indicative of prognosis and enabling targeted therapy using several commonly employed drugs and inhibitors, such as bleomycin, dexamethasone, statins and some matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors such as TAPI-1 and BB3103. Importantly, to design drug carriers with enhanced circulatory durability, the adaptation of soluble forms of physiological receptors/ligands has been purported. Research has shown that soluble forms are more effective than antibody forms in enabling targeted treatment of certain conditions, such as autoimmune diseases.

     "abstract": "A widely appreciated conclusion from evolutionary theory is that senescence (aging) is of no adaptive value to the individual that it afflicts. Yet studies of Caenorhabditis elegans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are increasingly revealing the presence of processes which actively cause senescence and death, leading some biogerontologists to wonder about the established theory. Here we argue that programmed death that increases fitness could occur in C. elegans and S. cerevisiae, and that this is consistent with the classic evolutionary theory of aging. This is because of the special conditions under which these organisms have evolved, particularly the existence of clonal populations with limited dispersal and, in the case of C. elegans, the brevity of the reproductive period caused by protandrous hermaphroditism. Under these conditions, death-promoting mechanisms could promote worm fitness by enhancing inclusive fitness, or worm colony fitness through group selection. Such altruistic, adaptive death is not expected to evolve in organisms with outbred, dispersed populations (e.g. most vertebrate species). The plausibility of adaptive death in C. elegans is supported by computer modelling studies, and new knowledge about the ecology of this species. To support these arguments we also review the biology of adaptive death, and distinguish three forms: consumer sacrifice, biomass sacrifice and defensive sacrifice.",

Longitudinal cohort studies were identified through a systematic search of major electronic databases from inception to May 2018. A random effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate survival time and relative risk of death.Overall, 11 studies were identified including 22,952 patients with dementia: 2029 with DLB (mean diagnosis age 76.3; 47% female) compared with 20,923 with AD (mean diagnosis age 77.2; 65.1% female). Average survival time in DLB from diagnosis was 4.11 years (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20094.10) and in AD 5.66 (SD\u2009\u00b1\u20095.32) years, equating to a 1.60 (95% CI: -2.44 to -0.77) years shorter survival in DLB (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Relative risk of death was increased by 1.35 (95%CI: 1.17\u20131.55) in DLB compared to AD (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Differences in survival were not explained by follow-up time, age at diagnosis, gender, or cognitive score.There is consistent evidence for higher and earlier mortality in DLB compared to AD. This is important for all stakeholders and underlines the importance of expanding research into DLB.",

     "abstract": "Frailty is a well-established risk factor for adverse health outcomes. However, comparatively little is known about the dynamic nature of frailty and the extent to which it can improve. The purposes of this study were to systematically search for studies examining frailty transitions over time among community-dwelling older people, and to synthesise pooled frailty transitions rates. Four electronic databases (Medline, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL) were searched in July 2018. Inclusion criteria were: prospective design, community-dwelling older people with mean age > 60, using 5-item frailty phenotype criteria to define three states: robust, prefrail and frail and the numbers of participants with 9 frailty transition patterns based on frailty status at baseline and follow-up. Exclusion criteria were: selected populations, using fewer than 5 frailty phenotype criteria. Two investigators independently screened 504 studies for eligibility and identified 16 studies for this review. Data were extracted by the two investigators independently. Pooled rates of frailty transition patterns were calculated by random-effects meta-analysis. Among 42,775 community-dwelling older people from 16 studies with a mean follow-up of 3.9 years (range: 1\u201310 years), 13.7% (95%CI\u2009=\u200911.7\u201315.8%) improved, 29.1% (95%CI\u2009=\u200925.9\u201332.5%) worsened and 56.5% (95%CI\u2009=\u200954.2\u201358.8%) maintained the same frailty status. Among those who were robust at baseline, pooled rates of remaining robust or transitioning to prefrail and frail were 54.0% (95%CI\u2009=\u200948.8\u201359.1%), 40.6% (95%CI\u2009=\u200936.7\u201344.7%) and 4.5% (95%CI\u2009=\u20093.2\u20136.1%), respectively. Among those who were prefrail at baseline, corresponding rates to robust, prefrail and frail were 23.1% (95%CI\u2009=\u200918.8\u201327.6%), 58.2% (95%CI\u2009=\u200955.6\u201360.7%) and 18.2% (95%CI\u2009=\u200914.9\u201321.7%), respectively. Among those who were frail at baseline, pooled rates of transitioning to robust, prefrail and remaining frail were 3.3% (95%CI\u2009=\u20091.6\u20135.5%), 40.3% (95%CI\u2009=\u200934.6\u201346.1%) and 54.5% (95%CI\u2009=\u200947.6\u201361.3%), respectively. Stratified and meta-regression analyses showed age, gender and follow-up period were associated with frailty transition patterns. Older people make dynamic changes in their frailty status. Given that while one quarter of prefrail older people improved to robust only 3% of frail older people did, early interventions should be considered.",

Pathological aggregated forms of the synaptic protein, \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn), are involved in the generation and progression of PD. In PD brains, \u03b1-syn accumulates inside neurons and propagates from cell-to-cell in a prion-like manner. In this review, we discuss the in vitro and in vivo models used to study the prion-like properties of \u03b1-syn and related findings. In particular, we focus on the different mechanisms of \u03b1-syn spreading, which could be relevant for the development of alternative therapeutic approaches for PD treatment.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the impact of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of \u2018real-world\u2019 interventions on the cognitive abilities of healthy older adults. Database searches were performed between October 2016 and September 2018. Forty-three RCTs were eligible for inclusion with 2826 intervention participants and 2234 controls. Interventions to enhance cognitive ability consisted of participation in activities that were physical (25 studies), cognitive (9 studies), or mixed (i.e., physical and cognitive; 7 studies), and two studies used other interventions that included older adults assisting schoolchildren and engagement via social network sites. Meta-analysis revealed that Trail Making Test (TMT) A, p\u2009=\u2009 0.05, M\u2009=\u20090.43, 95% CI [-0.00, 0.86], digit symbol substitution, p\u2009=\u2009 0.05, M\u2009=\u20090.30, 95% CI [0.00, 0.59], and verbal fluency, p\u2009=\u2009 0.04, M\u2009=\u20090.31, 95% CI [0.02, 0.61], improved after specific types of interventions versus the control groups (which were either active, wait-list or passive controls). When comparing physical activity interventions against all control groups, TMT A, p\u2009=\u2009 0.04, M\u2009=\u20090.25, 95% CI [0.01, 0.48], and digit span forward, p\u2009=\u2009 0.05, M\u2009=\u20090.91, 95% CI [-0.00, 1.82], significantly improved. Results remained non-significant for all outcomes when comparing cognitive activity interventions against all control groups. Results therefore suggest that healthy older adults are more likely to see cognitive improvements when involved in physical activity interventions. In addition, TMT A was the only measure that consistently showed significant improvements following physical activity interventions. Visuospatial abilities (as measured by TMT A) may be more susceptible to improvement following physical activity-based interventions, and TMT A may be a useful tool for detecting differences in that domain.",

     "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is usually described as an intermediate phase between normal cognition and dementia. Identifying the subjects at a higher risk of progressing from MCI to AD is essential to manage this condition. The diagnosis of MCI is mainly clinical. Several biomarkers have been proposed, but mostly for research purposes, as they are based on an invasive procedure to obtain the sample, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As a consequence, rapid and non-invasive biomarkers are needed to improve diagnosis. The objective of this systematic review is to summarize available evidence on the use of miRNAs as biomarkers in subjects with MCI.Relevant literature published up to June 2018 was retrieved searching the databases PubMed, ISI Web of Knowledge and the Cochrane Database. Only studies considering microRNAs (miRNAs) and a diagnosis of MCI were included. Data were extracted using a specifically-designed standardized form, and their methodological quality was assessed using QUADAS-2 and QUIPS.Twenty-one studies of 153 retrieved articles met the predefined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Studies included participants ranging from 6 to 330. More than 40 miRNAs resulted as dysregulated, and miR-206 was the only miRNA that was found as differentially expressed in patients with MCI by more than two studies. However, these results have either not yet been confirmed in other independent cohorts, or data are still inconsistent. Inconsistencies among included studies could be due to several issues including the selection of participants, pre-analytical and analytical procedures, and statistical analyses.",

     "abstract": "The Mediterranean diet (MD) is a gold standard for nutrition and the most evidence-based diet to delay the onset of age-associated pathologies. Telomeres are the heterochromatic repeat regions found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, whose length is considered a reliable hallmark of biological ageing. Telomere shortening is, at least in part, a modifiable factor and there is evidence that adherence to the MD is associated with longer telomeres. Data from several studies indicate an association between \u201cinflammatory/oxidative status\u201d and telomere length (TL). The MD, as a complex exposome with thousands of nutrients and phytochemicals, may positively influence telomere attrition by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress. However, it is unclear whether the protective effects on TL provided by the MD result from its individual constituents or some combination of these. Furthermore, these properties of the MD and its components are not yet fully validated by clinical endpoints in randomized trials or observational studies. Here, we summarize the data from experimental and population-based studies on the effects of the MD on TL maintenance. We will both highlight the possible role of the MD in the prevention of age-associated diseases, and attempt to identify certain aspects of the diet that are particularly important for telomere maintenance.",

Expansions above 40 polyglutamine repeats are invariably fatal, following a symptomatic period characterised by choreiform movements, behavioural abnormalities, and cognitive decline. While mutant huntingtin (mHtt) is widely expressed from early life, most patients with HD present in mid-adulthood, highlighting the role of ageing in disease pathogenesis. mHtt undergoes proteolytic cleavage, misfolding, accumulation, and aggregation into inclusion bodies. The emerging model of HD pathogenesis proposes that the chronic production of misfolded mHtt overwhelms the chaperone machinery, diverting other misfolded clients to the proteasome and the autophagy pathways, ultimately leading to a global collapse of the proteostasis network. Multiple converging hypotheses also implicate ageing and its impact in the dysfunction of organelles as additional contributing factors to the collapse of proteostasis in HD. In particular, mitochondrial function is required to sustain the activity of ATP-dependent chaperones and proteolytic machinery. Recent studies elucidating mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum interactions and uncovering a dedicated proteostasis machinery in mitochondria, suggest that mitochondria play a more active role in the maintenance of cellular proteostasis than previously thought. The enhancement of cytosolic proteostasis pathways shows promise for HD treatment, protecting cells from the detrimental effects of mHtt accumulation. In this review, we consider how mHtt and its post translational modifications interfere with protein quality control pathways, and how the pharmacological and genetic modulation of components of the proteostasis network impact disease phenotypes in cellular and in vivo HD models.",

These changes are often irreversible, as organisms, humans included, evolved fully differentiated, irreplaceable cells (e.g. neurons) and structures (e.g. skeleton). Hence, deterioration or loss of at least some cells and structures should lead to inevitable aging of these organisms. Yet, some cells may escape this fate: adult somatic cells may be converted to partially reprogrammed cells or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). By their nature, iPSCs are the cells representing the early stages of life, indicating a possibility of reversing the age of cells within the organism. Reprogramming strategies may be accomplished both in vitro and in vivo, offering opportunities for rejuvenation in the context of whole organisms. Similarly, older organs may be replaced with the younger ones prepared ex vivo, or grown within other organisms or even other species. How could the irreversibility of aging of some parts of the organism be reconciled with the putative reversal of aging of the other parts of the same organism? Resolution of this question holds promise for dramatically extending lifespan, which is currently not possible with traditional genetic, dietary and pharmacological approaches. Critical issues in this challenge are the nature of aging, relationship between aging of an organism and aging of its parts, relationship between cell dedifferentiation and rejuvenation, and increased risk of cancer that goes hand in hand with rejuvenation approaches.",

     "abstract": "There are numerous theories of aging, a process which still seems inevitable. Aging leads to cancer and multi-systemic disorders as well as chronic diseases. Decline in age- associated cellular functions leads to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline that affect the quality of life. Accumulation of damage, mutations, metabolic changes, failure in cellular energy production and clearance of altered proteins over the lifetime, and hyperhomocysteinemia, ultimately result in tissue degeneration. The decline in renal functions, nutritional deficiencies, deregulation of methionine cycle and deficiencies of homocysteine remethylation and transsulfuration cofactors cause elevation of homocysteine with advancing age. Abnormal accumulation of homocysteine is a risk factor of cardiovascular, neurodegenerative and chronic kidney disease. Moreover, approximately 50% of people, aged 65 years and older develop hypertension and are at a high risk of developing cardiovascular insufficiency and incurable neurodegenerative disorders. Increasing evidence suggests inverse relation between cognitive impairment, cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events and renal function. Oxidative stress, inactivation of nitric oxide synthase pathway and mitochondria dysfunction associated with impaired homocysteine metabolism lead to aging tissue degeneration.

     "abstract": "A chronic low-grade inflammation is one of the hallmarks of the aging process. This gradually augmenting inflammatory state has been termed inflammaging. Inflammaging is associated with increased myelopoiesis in the bone marrow. This myelopoiesis-biased process increases the generation not only of mature myeloid cells, e.g. monocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils, but also immature myeloid progenitors and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). It is known that the aging process is associated with a significant increase in the presence of MDSCs in the bone marrow, blood, spleen, and peripheral lymph nodes. Consequently, MDSCs will become recruited into inflamed tissues where they suppress acute inflammatory responses and trigger the resolution of inflammation. However, if the perpetrator cannot be eliminated, the long-term presence of MDSCs suppresses the host\u2019s immune defence and increases the susceptibility to infections and tumorigenesis. Chronic immunosuppression also impairs the clearance of waste products and dead cells, impairs energy metabolism, and disturbs tissue proteostasis. This immunosuppressive state is reminiscent of the immunosenescence observed in inflammaging. It seems that proinflammatory changes in tissues with aging stimulate the myelopoietic production of MDSCs which subsequently induces immunosenescence and maintains the chronic inflammaging process. We will briefly describe the functions of MDSCs and then examine in detail how inflammaging enhances the generation MDSCs and how MDSCs are involved in the control of immunosenescence occurring in inflammaging.",

     "abstract": "A number of independent studies have shown the contribution of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. Indeed, GAPDH aggregates have been found in many post-mortem samples of brains of patients diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson disease. Currently, it is accepted that GAPDH-mediated cell death pathways in the neurodegenerative processes are associated with apoptosis caused by GAPDH nuclear translocation and excessive aggregation under oxidative stress conditions. Also the role of GAPDH in neurodegenerative diseases is linked to it directly binding to specific amyloidogenic proteins and petides such as \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein, \u03b2-amyloid peptide and tau protein in Alzheimer\u2019s disease, huntingtin in Huntington\u2019s disease and \u03b1-synuclein in Parkinson disease. One of the latest studies indicated that GAPDH aggregates significantly accelerate amyloidogenesis of the \u03b2-amyloid peptide, which implies that aggregates of GAPDH may act as a specific aggregation \u201cseed\u201d in vitro.Previous detailed studies revealed that the active-site cysteine (Cys152) of GAPDH plays an essential role in the oxidative stress-induced aggregation of GAPDH associated with cell death. Furthermore, oxidative modification of this cysteine residue initiates the translocation of the enzyme to the nucleus, subsequently leading to apoptosis. The crystallographic structure of GAPDH shows that the Cys152 residue is located close to the surface of the molecule in a hydrophilic environment, which means that it can react with low molecular weight compounds such as hydroxynonenal or piceatannol. Therefore, it is highly possible that GAPDH may serve as a target for small molecule compounds with the potential to slow down or prevent the progression of neurodegenerative disorders.Recently appearing new evidence has highlighted the significance of low molecular weight compounds in counteracting the oxidation of GAPDH and consequently its aggregation and other unfavourable pathological processes. Hence, this review aims to present all recent findings concerning molecules that are able to interact with GAPDH and counteract its aggregation and translocation to the nucleus.",

The long-term health consequences of physical trauma are well known in the medical community, how trauma effects the ageing process at a molecular level is not. It has long been difficult to assess ageing trajectories due to the absence of a biomarker of biological rather than chronological age. Recent advances in epigenetics have helped by identifying specific DNA methylation sites as good indicators of biological age. Recent investigations into the impact of psychological trauma and the associated physical stress on accelerating ageing as measured by epigenetic drift are promising. The physical and metabolic stress which is synonymous with physical trauma may also accelerate the ageing process. We suggest that long term epigenetic profiling is required to understand to what degree the ageing trajectory is altered by trauma, which will in turn add support for the development of novel therapies to improve health outcomes for survivors of traumatic injury.",

Whilst these alterations are intrinsic to the cardiac myocytes, they are modulated by the cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) and consequently, ageing of the cardiac ANS is fundamental to the development of arrhythmias. A systems-based approach that incorporates the influence of the cardiac ANS could lead to better mechanistic understanding of how arrhythmogenic triggers and substrates interact spatially and temporally to produce sustained arrhythmia and why its incidence increases with age. Despite the existence of physiological oscillations of ANS activity on the heart, pathological oscillations can lead to defective activation and recovery properties of the myocardium. Such changes can be attributable to the decrease in functionality and structural alterations to ANS specific receptors in the myocardium with age. These altered ANS adaptive responses can occur either as a normal ageing process or accelerated in the presence of specific cardiac pathologies, such as genetic mutations or neurodegenerative conditions. Targeted intervention that seek to manipulate the ageing ANS influence on the myocardium may prove to be an efficacious approach for the management of arrhythmia in the ageing population.",

Several disease-modifying agents, including lifestyle intervention, antidiabetic drugs and antiplatelet agents besides aspirin have been shown to reduce TX biosynthesis. Taken together, these aspects may contribute to the development of promising mechanism-based therapeutic strategies to reduce the progression of atherothrombosis.We intended to critically review current knowledge on both the pathophysiological significance of urinary TXM excretion in clinical settings related to ageing and atherothrombosis, as well as its prognostic value as a biomarker of vascular events.",

Data from post-hoc WHI analyses and newer clinical trials consistently show reductions in coronary heart disease and mortality when estrogen therapy is initiated soon after menopause, whereas administration in later years and/or in combination with progesterone carries increased risks. However, no validated primary preventive strategies are available for younger postmenopausal women (<60 years), highlighting the need to re-evaluate the use of estrogen alone for which the risk\u2013benefit balance appears positive. In contrast, in older women (>60 years), risks associated with oral HT exceed benefits; however transdermal estrogen may offer a safer alternative and should be further evaluated.

Continuously emerging epidemiological data and experimental models are showing additional protective effects of metformin against a number of age-related diseases (ARDs), e.g., cardiovascular diseases and cancer.

However, a unifying or prevailing mechanism of action of metformin is still debated. Here, we summarize the epidemiological data linking metformin to ARD prevention. Then, we dissect the deeply studied mechanisms of action explaining its antihyperglycemic effect and the putative mechanisms supporting its anti-ageing properties, focusing on studies using clinically pertinent doses. We hypothesize that the molecular observations obtained in different models with metformin could be indirectly mediated by its effect on gut flora. Novel evidence suggests that metformin reshapes the human microbiota, promoting the growth of beneficial bacterial species and counteracting the expansion of detrimental bacterial species. In turn, this action would influence the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory circulating factors, thereby promoting glycaemic control and healthy ageing. This framework may reconcile diverse observations, providing information for designing further studies to elucidate the complex interplay between metformin and the metabiome harboured in mammalian body compartments, thereby paving the way for innovative, bacterial-based therapeutics to manage type 2 diabetes and foster a longer healthspan.",

Expansion size correlates with age-at-onset (AO) and severity, and shows a critical threshold for each polyQ disease. Although an expanded CAG tract is sufficient to trigger disease, not all variation in AO is explained by (CAG)n length, which suggests the contribution of other modifying factors. Methods used to identify genetic modifiers in polyQ diseases have progressed from candidate genes to unbiased genome-wide searches. Inconsistency of results from candidate-genes studies are partly explained by sample size, study design and variable population frequency of \u201cpolymorphisms\u201d; a genome-wide search may help elucidating more precise disease mechanisms underlying specific interaction networks. We review known genetic modifiers for polyQ diseases, and discuss developing strategies to find modulation, from common variants to networks disclosing small cumulative effects of key genes and modifying pathways. This may lead to a better understanding of genotype-phenotype correlation and the proposal of new potential targets for therapeutical interventions.",

     "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that moderate intensity aerobic exercise is positively correlated with cognitive function and memory. However, the exact mechanisms underlying such improvements remain unclear. Recent research in animal models allows proposition of a pathway in which brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a key mediator. This perspective draws upon evidence from animal and human studies to highlight such a mechanism whereby exercise drives synthesis and accumulation of neuroactive metabolites such as myokines and ketone bodies in the periphery and in the hippocampus to enhance BDNF expression. BDNF is a neurotrophin with well-established properties of promoting neuronal survival and synaptic integrity, while its influence on energy transduction may provide the crucial link between inherent vascular and metabolic benefits of exercise with enhanced brain function. Indeed, BDNF mRNA and protein is robustly elevated in rats following periods of voluntary exercise. This was also correlated with improved spatial memory, while such benefits were abolished upon inhibition of BDNF signaling. Similarly, both BDNF and cardiovascular fitness arising from aerobic exercise have been positively associated with hippocampal volume and function in humans. We postulate that exercise will attenuate cortical atrophy and synaptic loss inherent to neurodegenerative disorders - many of which also exhibit aberrant down-regulation of BDNF. Thus, the proposed link between BDNF, exercise and cognition may have critical therapeutic implications for the prevention and amelioration of memory loss and cognitive impairment in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and associated dementias.",

In living organisms, a careful balance between NAD production and degradation serves to regulate NAD levels. Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated that NAD levels decrease with age, and the deterioration of NAD metabolism promotes several aging-associated diseases, including metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases and various cancers. Conversely, the upregulation of NAD metabolism, including dietary supplementation with NAD precursors, has been shown to prevent the decline of NAD and exhibits beneficial effects against aging and aging-associated diseases. In addition, many studies have demonstrated that genetic and/or nutritional activation of NAD metabolism can extend the lifespan of diverse organisms. Collectively, it is clear that NAD metabolism plays important roles in aging and longevity. In this review, we summarize the basic functions of the enzymes involved in NAD synthesis and degradation, as well as the outcomes of their dysregulation in various aging processes.

For the sample of 105 articles, we summarized methods and findings by type of social stressor (socioeconomic stressors, stressful life events, work-related stressors, and neighborhood stressors) and by age of the study population (infants/children, middle-aged adults, older adults, and mixed samples of middle-aged and older adults). We found more variation in TL measurement methodology in studies of infants/children and older adults than in studies focusing on middle-aged adults. The most consistent finding was a relationship between early-life stressors and shorter TL. Work and neighborhood stressors, and older populations, are currently understudied. Across all stressors, limited evidence suggests that the stress-TL relationship may be moderated by characteristics such as age, sex, and race/ethnicity.

     "abstract": "Age-related loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, sarcopenia, is associated with physical frailty and increased risk of morbidity (chronic diseases), in addition to all-cause mortality. The loss of muscle mass occurs incipiently from middle-age (\u223c1%/year), and in severe instances can lead to a loss of \u223c50% by the 8\u20139th decade of life. This review will focus on muscle deterioration with ageing and highlight the two underpinning mechanisms regulating declines in muscle mass and function: muscle fibre atrophy and muscle fibre loss (hypoplasia) \u2013 and their measurement. The mechanisms of muscle fibre atrophy in humans relate to imbalances in muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and breakdown (MPB); however, since there is limited evidence for basal alterations in muscle protein turnover, it would appear that \u201canabolic resistance\u201d to fundamental environmental cues regulating diurnal muscle homeostasis (namely physical activity and nutrition), underlie age-related catabolic perturbations in muscle proteostasis. While the \u2018upstream\u2019 drivers of the desensitization of aged muscle to anabolic stimuli are poorly defined, they most likely relate to impaired efficiency of the conversion of nutritional/exercise stimuli into signalling impacting mRNA translation and proteolysis. Additionally, loss of muscle fibres has been shown in cadaveric studies using anatomical fibre counts, and from iEMG studies demonstrating motor unit loss, albeit with few molecular investigations of this in humans. We suggest that defining countermeasures against sarcopenia requires improved understandings of the co-ordinated regulation of muscle fibre atrophy and fibre loss, which are likely to be inextricably linked.",

     "abstract": "Evolution by natural selection eliminates maladaptive traits from a species, and yet Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD) persists with rapidly increasing prevalence globally. This apparent paradox begs an explanation within the framework of evolutionary sciences. Here, I summarize and critique previously proposed theories to explain human susceptibility to AD, grouped into 8 distinct hypotheses based on the concepts of novel extension of the lifespan; lack of selective pressure during the post-reproductive phase; antagonistic pleiotropy; rapid brain evolution; delayed neuropathy by selection for grandmothering; novel alleles selected to delay neuropathy; by-product of selection against cardiovascular disease; and thrifty genotype. Subsequently, I describe a new hypothesis inspired by the concept of mismatched environments. Many of the factors that enhance AD risk today may have been absent or functioned differently before the modern era, potentially making AD a less common affliction for age-matched individuals before industrialization and for the majority of human history. Future research is needed to further explore whether changes in environments and lifestyles across human history moderate risk factors and susceptibility to AD.",

Physical exercise is suggested to have a protective effect on global cognition with aging. However, whether it influences executive function in people living with Alzheimer\u2019s-type dementia specifically is unknown. The current systematic review examined the efficacy of physical exercise on executive function performance in community-dwelling older adults living with Alzheimer\u2019s-type dementia. An electronic search of databases retrieved randomized and non-randomized controlled trials of community-dwelling older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s-type dementia who completed a physical exercise intervention and who were assessed using an executive function outcome measure. Methodological quality of six studies meeting the inclusion criteria published between 2009 and 2016 was scored independently by two raters using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database and a Cochrane informed domain-based assessment of risk of bias. Trends toward improvement in executive function scores were seen across all six studies, and significant improvement was seen in four of the eligible studies. Future studies should explore the benefits of the American College of Sports Medicine recommended 150\u2009min of physical exercise per week with select measures of executive function.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria and lysosomes undergo the most marked senescence-related alterations among all cellular organelles. Whereas mitochondria undergo gradual structural changes associated with reduced function, lysosomes exhibit progressively deteriorated function along with the accumulation of lipofuscins. Lysosomal dysfunction induces the deterioration of mitochondrial turnover, resulting in the generation of more reactive oxygen species (ROS), with the increased ROS levels in turn targeting lysosomes. This vicious feedback loop between lysosomes and mitochondria thus aggravates senescence phenotypes. Based on findings that lysosomal activity is diminished in senescent cells and that the resultant oxidative stress correlates with mitochondrial damage, the existence of a lysosomal\u2013mitochondrial axis with a functional role in senescence has been proposed. In this review, we interrogate the interplay between lysosomes and mitochondria during senescence and propose the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis to serve a potential function as an inducer of senescence alleviation. Thus, learning how to control the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis should represent an important research directive for developing therapeutics toward ageing-related disease as well as the aging process itself. Further research focusing on the lysosomal-mitochondrial axis will add to our knowledge regarding aging and age-related pathologies, as well as provide new strategies for anti-aging intervention.",

     "abstract": "Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation process and protective housekeeping mechanism to eliminate damaged organelles, long-lived misfolded proteins and invading pathogens. Autophagy functions to recycle building blocks and energy for cellular renovation and homeostasis, allowing cells to adapt to stress. Modulation of autophagy is a potential therapeutic target for a diverse range of diseases, including metabolic conditions, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers and infectious diseases. Traditionally, food deprivation and calorie restriction (CR) have been considered to slow aging and increase longevity. Since autophagy inhibition attenuates the anti-aging effects of CR, it has been proposed that autophagy plays a substantive role in CR-mediated longevity. Among several stress stimuli inducers of autophagy, fasting and CR are the most potent non-genetic autophagy stimulators, and lack the undesirable side effects associated with alternative interventions. Despite the importance of autophagy, the evidence connecting fasting or CR with autophagy promotion has not previously been reviewed. Therefore, our objective was to weigh the evidence relating the effect of CR or fasting on autophagy promotion. We conclude that both fasting and CR have a role in the upregulation of autophagy, the evidence overwhelmingly suggesting that autophagy is induced in a wide variety of tissues and organs in response to food deprivation.",

     "abstract": "Biological ageing is generally accompanied by a gradual loss of cellular functions and physiological integrity of organ systems, the consequential enhancement of vulnerability, senescence and finally death. Mechanisms which underlie ageing are primarily attributed to an array of diverse but related factors including free radical-induced damage, dysfunction of mitochondria, disruption of circadian rhythms, inflammaging, genomic instability, telomere attrition, loss of proteostasis, deregulated sensing of nutrients, epigenetic alterations, altered intercellular communication, and decreased capacity for tissue repair. Melatonin, a prime regulator of human chronobiological and endocrine physiology, is highly reputed as an antioxidant, immunomodulatory, antiproliferative, oncostatic, and endocrine-modulatory molecule. Interestingly, several recent reports support melatonin as an anti-ageing agent whose multifaceted functions may lessen the consequences of ageing. This review depicts four categories of melatonin\u2019s protective effects on ageing-induced molecular and structural alterations.

However, complementary molecular frailty biomarkers or ideally biomarker panels have not yet been identified. We conducted a systematic search to identify biomarker candidates for a frailty biomarker panel.Gene expression databases were searched (http://genomics.senescence.info/genes including GenAge, AnAge, LongevityMap, CellAge, DrugAge, Digital Aging Atlas) to identify genes regulated in aging, longevity, and age-related diseases with a focus on secreted factors or molecules detectable in body fluids as potential frailty biomarkers. Factors broadly expressed, related to several \u201challmark of aging\u201d pathways as well as used or predicted as biomarkers in other disease settings, particularly age-related pathologies, were identified. This set of biomarkers was further expanded according to the expertise and experience of the authors. In the next step, biomarkers were assigned to six \u201challmark of aging\u201d pathways, namely (1) inflammation, (2) mitochondria and apoptosis, (3) calcium homeostasis, (4) fibrosis, (5) NMJ (neuromuscular junction) and neurons, (6) cytoskeleton and hormones, or (7) other principles and an extensive literature search was performed for each candidate to explore their potential and priority as frailty biomarkers.A total of 44 markers were evaluated in the seven categories listed above, and 19 were awarded a high priority score, 22 identified as medium priority and three were low priority. In each category high and medium priority markers were identified.Biomarker panels for frailty would be of high value and better than single markers. Based on our search we would propose a core panel of frailty biomarkers consisting of (1) CXCL10 (C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10), IL-6 (interleukin 6), CX3CL1 (C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1), (2) GDF15 (growth differentiation factor 15), FNDC5 (fibronectin type III domain containing 5), vimentin (VIM), (3) regucalcin (RGN/SMP30), calreticulin, (4) PLAU (plasminogen activator, urokinase), AGT (angiotensinogen), (5) BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor), progranulin (PGRN), (6) \u03b1-klotho (KL), FGF23 (fibroblast growth factor 23), FGF21, leptin (LEP), (7) miRNA (micro Ribonucleic acid) panel (to be further defined), AHCY (adenosylhomocysteinase) and KRT18 (keratin 18). An expanded panel would also include (1) pentraxin (PTX3), sVCAM/ICAM (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1/Intercellular adhesion molecule 1), defensin \u03b1, (2) APP (amyloid beta precursor protein), LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), (3) S100B (S100 calcium binding protein B), (4) TGF\u03b2 (transforming growth factor beta), PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1), TGM2 (transglutaminase 2), (5) sRAGE (soluble receptor for advanced glycosylation end products), HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1), C3/C1Q (complement factor 3/1Q), ST2 (Interleukin 1 receptor like 1), agrin (AGRN), (6) IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), resistin (RETN), adiponectin (ADIPOQ), ghrelin (GHRL), growth hormone (GH), (7) microparticle panel (to be further defined), GpnmB (glycoprotein nonmetastatic melanoma protein B) and lactoferrin (LTF).

Evidence suggests that the sarcopenic process and its structural and functional effects would be limited and/or reversed through NMES training using excito-motor currents (or direct currents). From a structural viewpoint, NMES helps reduce muscle atrophy. From a functional viewpoint, NMES enables the improvement of motor output (i.e., muscle strength), gait, balance and activities of daily living which enhances the quality of life of aged subjects. Muscle plasticity of aged subjects in response to NMES training turns out to be undeniable, although many mechanisms are not yet explained and deserve to be explore further. Mechanistic explanations as well as conceptual models are proposed to explain how muscle plasticity operates in aged subjects through NMES training. NMES could be seen as a clinically applicable training technique, safe and efficient among aged subjects and could be used more often as part of prevention of sarcopenia. Therapists and physical conditioners/trainers could exploit this new knowledge in their professional practice to improve life conditions (including the risk of fall) of frail and/or aged subjects.",

However, the increasing life expectancy experienced by populations in developed countries also involves a significantly increased incidence of the most common age-related diseases (ARDs). Senescent cells (SCs) have been identified as culprits of organismal aging. Their number rises with age and their senescence-associated secretory phenotype fuels the chronic, pro-inflammatory systemic state (inflammaging) that characterizes aging, impairing the regenerative ability of stem cells and increasing the risk of developing ARDs. A variegated class of molecules, including synthetic senolytic compounds and natural compounds contained in food, have been suggested to possess anti-senescence activity. Senolytics are attracting growing interest, and their safety and reliability as anti-senescence drugs are being assessed in human clinical trials. Notably, since SCs spread inflammation at the systemic level through pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory signals, foods rich in polyphenols, which exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, have the potential to be harnessed as \u201canti-senescence foods\u201d in a nutraceutical approach to healthier aging.

In this sense, in the last decades, the post-translational modification O-linked \u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) has emerged as a potential causative link between hampered brain glucose metabolism and AD pathology. This is not surprising taking into account that this dynamic post-translational modification acts as a metabolic sensor that links glucose metabolism to normal neuronal functioning. Within this scenario, the present review aims to summarize the current understanding on the role of O-GlcNAcylation in neuronal physiology and AD pathology, emphasizing the close association of this post-translational modification with the emergence of AD-related hallmarks and its potential as a therapeutic target.",

Some biological and pharmaceutical compounds may reduce systemic inflammation and potentially avert functional decline occurring with aging. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to examine the association of pre-selected interventions on two established biomarkers of inflammation, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in middle-age and older adults with chronic LGI.We reviewed the literature on potential anti-inflammatory compounds, selecting them based on safety, tolerability, acceptability, innovation, affordability, and evidence from randomized controlled trials. Six compounds met all five inclusion criteria for our systematic review and meta-analysis: angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), metformin, omega-3, probiotics, resveratrol and vitamin D. We searched in MEDLINE, PubMed and EMBASE database until January 2017. A total of 49 articles fulfilled the selection criteria. Effect size of each study and pooled effect size for each compound were measured by the standardized mean difference. I2 was computed to measure heterogeneity of effects across studies.The following compounds showed a significant small to large effect in reducing IL-6 levels: probiotics (\u22120.68\u202fpg/ml), ARBs (\u22120.37\u202fpg/ml) and omega-3 (\u22120.19\u202fpg/ml). For CRP, a significant small to medium effect was observed with probiotics (\u22120.43\u202fmg/L), ARBs (\u22120.2\u202fmg/L), omega-3 (\u22120.17\u202fmg/L) and metformin (\u22120.16\u202fmg/L). Resveratrol and vitamin D were not associated with any significant reductions in either biomarker.These results suggest that nutritional and pharmaceutical compounds can significantly reduce established biomarkers of systemic inflammation in middle-age and older adults.

In humans, these neurons are only formed a few weeks after fertilization. Therefore, prenatal exposure to pesticides or industrial chemicals during crucial steps of brain development might also alter their proliferation and differentiation.Oxidative phosphorylation is one of the metabolic pathways sensitive to environmental toxicants and it is crucial for neuronal differentiation.

In this review, we examined the available clinical and epidemiological evidence for cognitive frailty. Despite its low prevalence (1.0\u20131.8%) in the community setting, cognitive frailty has been associated with a high risk of disability, poor quality of life, and death; while cognitive frailty appears to be associated with a high risk of dementia, there is no clear evidence for this association.

In this review we discuss peroxiredoxins, a class of proteinaceous antioxidants with redox signaling and chaperone functions, and their involvement in regulating longevity and stress resistance. Peroxiredoxins have a clear role in the regulation of lifespan and survival of many model organisms, including the mouse, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. Recent research on peroxiredoxins \u2212 in these models and beyond \u2212 has revealed surprising new insights regarding the interplay between peroxiredoxins and longevity signaling, which will be discussed here in detail.

Developing a greater understanding of auditory dysfunction in early AD may shed light on the mechanisms of disease progression and carry diagnostic and therapeutic importance. Herein, we review the literature on hearing abilities in AD and its prodromal stages investigated through methods such as pure-tone audiometry, dichotic listening tasks, and evoked response potentials.

     "abstract": "In response to persistent DNA damage, induction into cell senescence promotes an immunogenic program which facilitates immune clearance of these damaged cells. Under physiological conditions, senescent cells can activate both innate and adaptive immune responses, functioning to maintain tissue homeostasis. In addition, emerging findings suggest that programmed induction of cell senescence may be important for regulating reproductive processes, partly facilitated by immune clearance. However, likely owing to ageing of the immune system, a failure to eliminate senescent cells can contribute to their persistence in tissues, leading to the development and progression of age-related diseases. Such immune failure may in part be due to activation of the senescence program in immune cells, leading to their dysfunction. Furthermore, senescent cells under certain biological contexts have been shown to instead promote immune suppression, a response that may reflect differences between an acute verses chronic senescent phenotype. In this review, we provide an overview of the research to date concerning senescence immunosurviellance, including a focused discussion on the mechanisms by which macrophages may recognise senescent cells. Senescence immunotherapy strategies as an alternative to senolytics for the removal of senescent cells will also be discussed.",

     "abstract": "Since its discovery, G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 2, GIT2, and its family member, GIT1, have received considerable interest concerning their potential key roles in regulating multiple inter-connected physiological and pathophysiological processes. GIT2 was first identified as a multifunctional protein that is recruited to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) during the process of receptor internalization. Recent findings have demonstrated that perhaps one of the most important effects of GIT2 in physiology concerns its role in controlling multiple aspects of the complex ageing process. Ageing can be considered the most prevalent pathophysiological condition in humans, affecting all tissue systems and acting as a driving force for many common and intractable disorders. The ageing process involves a complex interplay among various deleterious activities that profoundly disrupt the body\u2019s ability to cope with damage, thus increasing susceptibility to pathophysiologies such as neurodegeneration, central obesity, osteoporosis, type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerosis. The biological systems that control ageing appear to function as a series of interconnected complex networks. The inter-communication among multiple lower-complexity signaling systems within the global ageing networks is likely coordinated internally by keystones or hubs, which regulate responses to dynamic molecular events through protein-protein interactions with multiple distinct partners. Multiple lines of research have suggested that GIT2 may act as one of these network coordinators in the ageing process. Identifying and targeting keystones, such as GIT2, is thus an important approach in our understanding of, and eventual ability to, medically ameliorate or interdict age-related progressive cellular and tissue damage.",

     "abstract": "Regulatory role of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), one of the most extensively studied members of its kind in histone deacetylase family in governing multiple cellular fates, is predominantly linked to p53 activity. SIRT1 deacetylates p53 in a NAD+-dependent manner to inhibit transcription activity of p53, in turn modulate pathways that are implicated in regulation of tissue homoeostasis and many disease states. In this review, we discuss the role of SIRT1-p53 pathway and its regulatory axis in the cellular events which are implicated in cellular aging, cancer and reprogramming. It is noteworthy that these cellular events share few common regulatory pathways, including SIRT1-p53-LDHA-Myc, miR-34a,-Let7 regulatory network, which forms a positive feedback loop that controls cell cycle, metabolism, proliferation, differentiation, epigenetics and many others. In the context of aging, SIRT1 expression is reduced as a protective mechanism against oncogenesis and for maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Interestingly, its activation in aged cells is evidenced in response to DNA damage to protect the cells from p53-dependent apoptosis or senescence, predispose these cells to neoplastic transformation. Importantly, the dual roles of SIRT1-p53 axis in aging and tumourigenesis, either as tumour suppressor or tumour promoter are determined by SIRT1 localisation and type of cells. Conceptualising the distinct similarity between tumorigenesis and cellular reprogramming, this review provides a perspective discussion on involvement of SIRT1 in improving efficiency in the induction and maintenance of pluripotent state. Further research in understanding the role of SIRT1-p53 pathway and their associated regulators and strategies to manipulate this regulatory axis very likely foster the development of therapeutics and strategies for treating cancer and aging-associated degenerative diseases.",

Monoamines (serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline) were most commonly investigated. A variety of methods were used to investigate the neurochemistry underlying agitation in AD and, although there were several conflicting findings, there was evidence of serotonergic deficit, relatively preserved dopaminergic function and compensatory overactivity of postsynaptic noradrenergic neurons in agitation in AD.Disruption of the dynamic balance between multiple neurotransmitter systems could impair functional neural networks involved in affective regulation and executive function. Differences in study design and methodology may have contributed to conflicting findings.

Downstream of LMNA or ZMPSTE24 mutations, the lamin A precursor, prelamin A, is accumulated in cells and affects chromatin dynamics and stress response. A new form of mandibuloacral dysplasia has been recently associated with mutations in POLD1 gene, encoding DNA polymerase delta, a major player in DNA replication.

Here, we review current knowledge on MAD clinical and pathogenetic aspects and highlight aspects typical of physiological ageing.",

Recent findings suggest IGF-1 is essential for neurogenesis in the adult brain, and this reduction of IGF-1 with ageing may contribute to age-related cognitive decline. Experimental studies have shown manipulation of the GH/GF-1 axis can slow rates of cognitive decline in animals, making IGF-1 a potential biomarker of cognition, and/or its signaling pathway a possible therapeutic target to prevent or slow age-related cognitive decline. A systematic literature review and qualitative narrative summary of current evidence for IGF-1 as a biomarker of cognitive decline in the ageing brain was undertaken. Results indicate IGF-1 concentrations do not confer additional diagnostic information for those with cognitive decline, and routine clinical measurement of IGF-1 is not currently justified. In cases of established cognitive impairment, it remains unclear whether increasing circulating or brain IGF-1 may reverse or slow down the rate of further decline. Advances in neuroimaging, genetics, neuroscience and the availability of large well characterized biobanks will facilitate research exploring the role of IGF-1 in both normal ageing and age-related cognitive decline.",

Neurons exhibit hyperactivity in response to hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and neurotoxic factors and release potential microglial activators. Microglial activation is also regulated by proinflammatory factors, caspase-3 activity, P2X7 receptor, interferon regulatory factor-8, and glucocorticoids. Modulation of microglia in diabetic encephalopathy may involve CX3CL1, p38 MAPK, purinergic, and CD200/CD200R signaling pathways, and pattern recognition receptors.

The triggers of normal brain ageing are not well understood, even less so the factors which initiate and steer the neuronal degeneration, which underpin disorders such as dementia. A wealth of data on how nutrients and diets may support cognitive function and preserve brain health are available, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying their biological action in both normal ageing, age-related cognitive decline, and in the development of neurodegenerative disorders have not been clearly elucidated.This review aims to summarise the current state of knowledge of vulnerabilities that predispose towards dysfunctional brain ageing, highlight potential protective mechanisms, and discuss dietary interventions that may be used as therapies. A special focus of this paper is on the impact of nutrition on neuroprotection and the underlying molecular mechanisms, and this focus reflects the discussions held during the 2nd workshop \u2018Nutrition for the Ageing Brain: Functional Aspects and Mechanisms\u2019 in Copenhagen in June 2016. The present review is the most recent in a series produced by the Nutrition and Mental Performance Task Force under the auspice of the International Life Sciences Institute Europe (ILSI Europe).Coupling studies of cognitive ageing with studies investigating the effect of nutrition and dietary interventions as strategies targeting specific mechanisms, such as neurogenesis, protein clearance, inflammation, and non-coding and microRNAs is of high value. Future research on the impact of nutrition on cognitive ageing will need to adopt a longitudinal approach and multimodal nutritional interventions will likely need to be imposed in early-life to observe significant impact in older age.",

     "abstract": "Ageing processes play a major contributing role for the development of Osteoarthritis (OA). This prototypic degenerative condition of ageing is the most common form of arthritis and is accompanied by a general decline, chronic pain and mobility deficits. The disease is primarily characterized by articular cartilage degradation, followed by subchondral bone thickening, osteophyte formation, synovial inflammation and joint degeneration. In the early stages, osteoarthritic chondrocytes undergo phenotypic changes that increase cell proliferation and cluster formation and enhance the production of matrix-remodelling enzymes. In fact, chondrocytes exhibit differentiation plasticity and undergo phenotypic changes during the healing process. Current studies are focusing on unravelling whether OA is a consequence of an abnormal wound healing response. Recent investigations suggest that alterations in different proteins, such as TGF-\u00df/BMPs, NF-K\u00df, Wnt, and Cx43, or SASP factors involved in signalling pathways in wound healing response, could be directly implicated in the initiation of OA. Several findings suggest that osteoarthritic chondrocytes remain in an immature state expressing stemness-associated cell surface markers. In fact, the efficacy of new disease-modifying OA drugs that promote chondrogenic differentiation in animal models indicates that this may be a drug-sensible state. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge regarding cellular plasticity in chondrocytes and OA. A better comprehension of the mechanisms involved in these processes may enable us to understand the molecular pathways that promote abnormal repair and cartilage degradation in OA. This understanding would be advantageous in identifying novel targets and designing therapies to promote effective cartilage repair and successful joint ageing by preventing functional limitations and disability.",

Cognitive abilities tend to decline as we get older. This age-related cognitive decline is mainly attributed to aberrant changes in synaptic plasticity and neuronal connections. Recent studies show that alterations in Ca2+ homeostasis underlie the increased vulnerability of neurons to age-related processes like cognitive decline and synaptic dysfunctions. Dysregulation of Ca2+ can lead to dramatic changes in neuronal functions. We discuss in this review, the recent advances on the potential role of dysregulated Ca2+ homeostasis through altered function of L-type voltage gated Ca2+ channels (LTCC) in ageing, with an emphasis on cognitive decline. This review therefore focuses on age-related changes mainly in the hippocampus, and with mention of other brain areas, that are important for learning and memory. This review also highlights age-related memory deficits via synaptic alterations and neuroinflammation. An understanding of these mechanisms will help us formulate strategies to reverse or ameliorate age-related disorders like cognitive decline.",

We propose that executive function is a key mediator of psychological therapies on autobiographical memory. We also highlight that interventions that alleviate stress and improve mood, including in major depression, can enhance autobiographical memory. Future research employing more longitudinal approaches and examining moderating factors such as gender and education level will deepen our understanding of changes in AM in later life, enhance our theoretical understanding of the neuroscience of AM and ageing, and help to develop better targeted interventions for preserving AM in older adults.",

Metaflammation resembles ageing-induced low-grade inflammation, previously referred to as inflammageing, in terms of clinical presentation and the molecular profile, pointing to a common aetiology for both conditions. Along with the mechanisms proposed to fuel inflammageing, here we dissect a plethora of pathological cascades triggered by gluco- and lipotoxicity, converging on candidate phenomena possibly explaining the enduring pro-inflammatory program observed in diabetic tissues, i.e. persistent immune-system stimulation, accumulation of senescent cells, epigenetic rearrangements, and alterations in microbiota composition. We discuss the possibility of harnessing these recent discoveries in future therapies for T2DM. Moreover, we review recent evidence regarding the ability of diets and physical exercise to modulate selected inflammatory pathways relevant for the diabetic pathology. Finally, we examine the latest findings showing putative anti-inflammatory mechanisms of anti-hyperglycaemic agents with proven efficacy against T2DM-induced cardiovascular complications, in order to gain insights into quickly translatable therapeutic approaches.",

For that purpose, we utilized robust Koch-like logical criteria, based on the assumption that some quantitative relationships between the accumulation of senescent cells and aging rate should exist.

Deficient protein degradation alters cellular proteostasis and activates signaling pathways that culminate in the induction of cellular senescence, whose accumulation is a typical feature of ageing.

The human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) and the corresponding animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are strongly governed by immunological events that primarily involve the adaptive arm of the immune response. MS and EAE are frequently characterised by a chronic pathology and a protracted disease course which thereby creates the potential for exposure to the inherent, on-going effects and consequences of ISC. Collective evidence is presented to confirm the occurrence of established and unendorsed biological markers of ISC during the development of both diseases. Moreover, results are discussed from studies during the course of MS and EAE that reveal a premature upregulation of ISC-related biomarkers which indicates untimely alterations to the adaptive immune system. The effects of ISC and a prematurely aged immune system on autoimmune-associated neurodegenerative conditions such as MS and EAE are largely unknown but current evaluation of data justifies and encourages further investigation.",

An epigenome consists of chemical modifications to the DNA and histone proteins without the changes in the DNA sequence. These modifications strongly depend on the environment, could be reversible and are potentially transmittable to daughter cells. Epigenetics includes DNA methylation, noncoding RNA interference, and modifications of histone proteins.

Metformin users also had reduced cancer compared to non-diabetics (rate ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.94, 95%CI 0.92\u20130.97) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to diabetics receiving non-metformin therapies (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.76, 95%CI 0.66\u20130.87) or insulin (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.78, 95%CI 0.73\u20130.83). Differences in baseline characteristics were observed which had the potential to bias findings, although statistical adjustments were made. The apparent reductions in all-cause mortality and diseases of ageing associated with metformin use suggest that metformin could be extending life and healthspans by acting as a geroprotective agent.",

     "abstract": "Neurons are highly energy demanding cells dependent on the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system. Mitochondria generate energy via respiratory complexes that constitute the electron transport chain. Adenosine triphosphate depletion or glucose starvation act as a trigger for the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK is an evolutionarily conserved protein that plays an important role in cell survival and organismal longevity through modulation of energy homeostasis and autophagy. Several studies suggest that AMPK activation may improve energy metabolism and protein clearance in the brains of patients with vascular injury or neurodegenerative disease. Mild mitochondrial dysfunction leads to activated AMPK signaling, but severe endoplasmic reticulum stress and mitochondrial dysfunction may lead to a shift from autophagy towards apoptosis and perturbed AMPK signaling. Hence, controlling mitochondrial dynamics and autophagic flux via AMPK activation might be a useful therapeutic strategy in neurodegenerative diseases to reinstate energy homeostasis and degrade misfolded proteins. In this review article, we discuss briefly the role of AMPK signaling in energy homeostasis, the structure of AMPK, activation mechanisms of AMPK, regulation of AMPK, the role of AMPK in autophagy, the role of AMPK in neurodegenerative diseases, and finally the role of autophagic flux in prion diseases.",

Ageing is characterized by an increase in the concentration of inflammatory markers in the bloodstream, a phenomenon that has been termed \u201cinflammageing\u201d. The inflammatory response is beneficial as an acute, transient reaction to harmful conditions, facilitating the defense, repair, turnover and adaptation of many tissues. However, chronic and low grade inflammation is likely to be detrimental for many tissues and for normal functions. We provide an overview of low grade inflammation (LGI) and determine the potential drivers and the effects of the \u201cinflamed\u201d phenotype observed in the elderly. We discuss the role of gut microbiota and immune system crosstalk and the gut-brain axis. Then, we focus on major health complications associated with LGI in the elderly, including mental health and wellbeing, metabolic abnormalities and infections. Finally, we discuss the possibility of manipulating LGI in the elderly by nutritional interventions. We provide an overview of the evidence that exists in the elderly for omega-3 fatty acid, probiotic, prebiotic, antioxidant and polyphenol interventions as a means to influence LGI. We conclude that slowing, controlling or reversing LGI is likely to be an important way to prevent, or reduce the severity of, age-related functional decline and the onset of conditions affecting health and well-being; that there is evidence to support specific dietary interventions as a strategy to control LGI; and that a continued research focus on this field is warranted.",

Thus, any attempt that influences CS, may be undertaken to reverse or inhibit senescence, whereby could prolong healthy life span. Until now, two main proposes are epigenetic and genetic modifications of cell fate. The first one concerns rejuvenation through effective reprogramming in cells undergoing senescence, or derived from very old or progeroid patients, by which is effective in vitro in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The second approach concerns modification of senescence signaling pathways like as IGF-induced agents. However, senescence research has experienced an unprecedented advance over recent years, particularly with the discovery that the rate of senescence is controlled, at least to some extent, by epigenetic pathways and biochemical processes conserved in evolution. In this review we try to concentrate on very specific pathways (DNA damage response, DDR, and epigenetic modifiers) and very specific determinants (senescence-associated secretory phenotype, SASP-miRNAs) of human premature aging. A major challenge is to dissect the interconnectedness between the candidate elements and their relative contributions to aging, with the final goal of identifying new opportunities for design of novel anti-aging treatments or avoidance of age-associated manifestations. While knowing that aging is unavoidable and we cannot expect its elimination, but prolonging healthy life span is a goal worth serious consideration.",

Over the past two decades, much effort has been done to understand the mechanisms of inflammaging in disease models such as type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and others. However, despite being the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, the number one communication disorder, and one of the top three chronic medical conditions of our aged population; little research has been conducted on the potential role of inflammation in age-related hearing loss (ARHL). Recently, it has been suggested that there is an inflammatory presence in the cochlea, perhaps involving diffusion processes of the blood-brain barrier as it relates to the inner ear. Recent research has found correlations between hearing loss and markers such as C-reactive protein, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 indicating inflammatory status in human case-cohort studies. However, there have been very few reports of in vivo research investigating the role of chronic inflammation\u2019s in hearing loss in the aging cochlea. Future research directed at better understanding the mechanisms of inflammation in the cochlea as well as the natural changes acquired with aging may provide a better understanding of how this process can accelerate presbycusis. Animal model experimentation and pre-clinical studies designed to recognize and characterize cochlear inflammatory mechanisms may suggest novel treatment strategies for preventing or treating ARHL. In this review, we seek to summarize key research in chronic inflammation, discuss its implications for possible roles in ARHL, and finally suggest directions for future investigations.",

Although motor symptoms respond to dopamine replacement therapies, the underlying disease process remains. This review details some features of the progressive molecular pathology and proposes deployment of a combination of nutrients: R-lipoic acid, acetyl-l-carnitine, ubiquinol, melatonin (or receptor agonists) and vitamin D3, with the collective potential to slow progression of these features. The main nutrient targets include impaired mitochondria and the associated oxidative/nitrosative stress, calcium stress and impaired gene transcription induced by pathogenic forms of alpha- synuclein. Benefits may be achieved via nutrient influence on epigenetic signaling pathways governing transcription factors for mitochondrial biogenesis, antioxidant defences and the autophagy-lysosomal pathway, via regulation of the metabolic energy sensor AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR. Nutrients also benefit expression of the transcription factor for neuronal survival (NR4A2), trophic factors GDNF and BDNF, and age-related calcium signals. In addition a number of non-motor related dysfunctions in circadian control, clock genes and associated metabolic, endocrine and sleep-wake activity are briefly addressed, as are late-stage complications in respect of cognitive decline and osteoporosis. Analysis of the network of nutrient effects reveals how beneficial synergies may counter the accumulation and promote clearance of pathogenic alpha-synuclein.",

In particular, cell reprogramming technologies have ushered in the era of personalized therapies that not only show a significant potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases but also promise to make biological rejuvenation feasible. We will first review recent evidence supporting the emerging view that aging is a reversible epigenetic phenomenon. Next, we will describe novel reprogramming approaches that overcome some of the intrinsic limitations of conventional induced-pluripotent-stem-cell technology. One of the alternative approaches, lineage reprogramming, consists of the direct conversion of one adult cell type into another by transgenic expression of multiple lineage-specific transcription factors (TF). Another strategy, termed pluripotency factor-mediated direct reprogramming, uses universal TF to generate epigenetically unstable intermediates able to differentiate into somatic cell types in response to specific differentiation factors. In the third part we will review studies showing the potential relevance of the above approaches for the treatment of AD and PD.",

In the current review of the rodent literature, we present arguments that question the robustness of the paradigm to increase lifespan and healthspan. Specifically, there are several questions to consider as follows: (1) At what age does CR no longer produce benefits? (2) Does CR attenuate cognitive decline? (3) Are there negative effects of CR, including effects on bone health, wound healing, and response to infection? (4) How important is schedule of feeding? (5) How long does CR need to be imposed to be effective? (6) How do genotype and gender influence CR? (7) What role does dietary composition play?

Accumulating data from observational and randomized clinical trials indicate that CR in humans results in some of the same metabolic and molecular adaptations that have been shown to improve health and retard the accumulation of molecular damage in animal models of longevity. In particular, moderate CR in humans ameliorates multiple metabolic and hormonal factors that are implicated in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer, the leading causes of morbidity, disability and mortality. In this paper, we will discuss the effects of CR in non-obese humans on these physiological parameters. Special emphasis is committed to recent clinical intervention trials that have investigated the feasibility and effects of CR in young and middle-aged men and women on parameters of energy metabolism and metabolic risk factors of age-associated disease in great detail. Additionally, data from individuals who are either naturally exposed to CR or those who are self-practicing this dietary intervention allows us to speculate on longer-term effects of more severe CR in humans.",

     "abstract": "Humans in modern societies typically consume food at least three times daily, while laboratory animals are fed ad libitum. Overconsumption of food with such eating patterns often leads to metabolic morbidities (insulin resistance, excessive accumulation of visceral fat, etc.), particularly when associated with a sedentary lifestyle. Because animals, including humans, evolved in environments where food was relatively scarce, they developed numerous adaptations that enabled them to function at a high level, both physically and cognitively, when in a food-deprived/fasted state. Intermittent fasting (IF) encompasses eating patterns in which individuals go extended time periods (e.g., 16\u201348\u00a0h) with little or no energy intake, with intervening periods of normal food intake, on a recurring basis. We use the term periodic fasting (PF) to refer to IF with periods of fasting or fasting mimicking diets lasting from 2 to as many as 21 or more days. In laboratory rats and mice IF and PF have profound beneficial effects on many different indices of health and, importantly, can counteract disease processes and improve functional outcome in experimental models of a wide range of age-related disorders including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease Parkinson\u2019s disease and stroke. Studies of IF (e.g., 60% energy restriction on 2\u00a0days per week or every other day), PF (e.g., a 5\u00a0day diet providing 750\u20131100\u00a0kcal) and time-restricted feeding (TRF; limiting the daily period of food intake to 8\u00a0h or less) in normal and overweight human subjects have demonstrated efficacy for weight loss and improvements in multiple health indicators including insulin resistance and reductions in risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The cellular and molecular mechanisms by which IF improves health and counteracts disease processes involve activation of adaptive cellular stress response signaling pathways that enhance mitochondrial health, DNA repair and autophagy. PF also promotes stem cell-based regeneration as well as long-lasting metabolic effects. Randomized controlled clinical trials of IF versus PF and isoenergetic continuous energy restriction in human subjects will be required to establish the efficacy of IF in improving general health, and preventing and managing major diseases of aging.",

However, sustaining a robust feeding-fasting cycle, even without altering nutrition quality or quantity, can prevent or reverse these chronic diseases in experimental models. In humans, epidemiological studies have shown erratic eating patterns increase the risk of disease, whereas sustained feeding-fasting cycles, or prolonged overnight fasting, is correlated with protection from breast cancer.

     "abstract": "Nearly a century of research has shown that nutritional interventions can delay aging and age- related diseases in many animal models and possibly humans. The most robust and widely studied intervention is caloric restriction, while protein restriction and restriction of various amino acids (methionine, tryptophan) have also been shown to delay aging. However, there is still debate over whether the major impact on aging is secondary to caloric intake, protein intake or specific amino acids. Nutritional geometry provides new perspectives on the relationship between nutrition and aging by focusing on calories, macronutrients and their interactions across a landscape of diets, and taking into account compensatory feeding in ad libitum-fed experiments. Nutritional geometry is a state-space modelling approach that explores how animals respond to and balance changes in nutrient availability. Such studies in insects and mice have shown that low protein, high carbohydrate diets are associated with longest lifespan in ad libitum fed animals suggesting that the interaction between macronutrients may be as important as their total intake.",

     "abstract": "With few exceptions, nutritional and dietary interventions generally impact upon both old-age quality of life and longevity. The life prolonging effects, commonly observed with dietary restriction reportedly are linked to alterations in protein intake and specifically limiting the dietary intake of certain essential amino acids. There is however a paucity of data methodically evaluating the various essential amino acids on health- and lifespan and the mechanisms involved. Rodent diets containing either lower methionine content, or tryptophan, than that found in commercially available chow, appear to elicit beneficial effects. It is unclear whether all of these favorable effects associated with restricted intake of methionine and tryptophan are due to their specific unique properties or if restriction of other essential amino acids, or proteins in general, may produce similar results. Considerably more work remains to be done to elucidate the mechanisms by which limiting these vital molecules may delay the onset of age-associated diseases and improve quality of life at older ages.",

Physical activity (PA) can influence the ageing process but the specific relationship with healthy ageing (HA) is unclear.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal studies examining the associations of PA with HA. Studies were identified from a systematic search across major electronic databases from inception as January 2017. Random-effect meta-analysis was performed to calculate a pooled effect size (ES) and 95% CIs. Studies were assessed for methodological quality.Overall, 23 studies were identified including 174,114 participants (30% men) with age ranges from 20 to 87 years old. There was considerable heterogeneity in the definition and measurement of HA and PA. Most of the identified studies reported a significant positive association of PA with HA, six reported a non-significant. Meta-analysis revealed that PA is positively associated with HA (ES: 1.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.23\u20131.57, n\u00a0=\u00a017) even if adjusted for publication bias (ES: 1.27, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.11\u20131.45, n\u00a0=\u00a020).There is consistent evidence from longitudinal observational studies that PA is positively associated with HA, regardless of definition and measurement.

Thus far only a limited number of robust longevity loci have been detected in either candidate or genome wide association studies. One of the issues in these genetic studies is the definition of the trait being either lifespan, including any age at death or longevity, i.e. survival above a diverse series of thresholds. Likewise heritability and segregation research have conflated lifespan with longevity. The heritability of lifespan estimated across most studies has been rather low. Environmental factors have not been sufficiently investigated and the total amount of genetic variance contributing to longevity has not been estimated in sufficiently well-defined and powered studies. Up to now, genetic longevity studies lack the required insights into the nature and size of the genetic component and the optimal strategies for meta-analysis and subject selection for Next Generation Sequencing efforts. Historical demographic data containing deep genealogical information may help in estimating the best definition and heritability for longevity, its transmission patterns in multi-generational datasets and may allow relevant additive and modifying environmental factors such as socio-economic status, geographical background, exposure to environmental effects, birth order, and number of children to be included.

The development of neuroimaging techniques in the past two decades has considerably increased our understanding of the brain mechanisms that might underlie cognitive performance and resulting changes due to normal aging. Beside traditional metabolic neuroimaging techniques, such as Positron Emission Tomography and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), an optical imaging technique allowing to monitor real-time cerebral blood oxygenation, has gained recent interest in this field. The aim of the present review paper, after briefly presenting the NIRS technique, is to review and to summarize the recent results of neuroimaging studies using this technique in the field of cognitive aging. The reviewed literature shows that, despite low spatial resolution and cerebral depth penetration, this technique provides consistent findings on the reduced hemodynamic activity as a function of chronological age, mainly in the prefrontal cortex. Important moderators of brain hemodynamics, such as cognitive load, subjects\u2019 characteristics and experimental conditions, for which the NIRS technique is sensitive, are discussed. Strengths and weaknesses of functional NIRS in the field of cognitive aging are presented and finally, novel perspectives of research are proposed.",

The only study which addressed the possible relationship between DNA repair modulations and frailty status also failed in finding association. Despite the large number of cellular alterations known to be associated with frailty, studies on this issue are still very scarce and limited to some of the possible cellular targets.

Four groups of risk factors and eight multimorbidity associated outcomes were explored by five and six studies, respectively. Nine studies evaluated interventions, which could be categorized into either organizational or patient-oriented, the effects of these interventions were varied. Self-management process, priority setting and decision making in multimorbidity were synthesised by evidence from 4 qualitative systematic reviews.

FGF21 also controls stress responses and metabolism by modulating the functions of somatotropic axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) pathway. FGF21 is a potent longevity factor coordinating interactions between energy metabolism and stress responses. Recent studies have revealed that FGF21 treatment can alleviate many age-related metabolic disorders, e.g. atherosclerosis, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and some cardiovascular diseases.

First, we will describe the role of FGF21 in interorgan energy metabolism and explain how its functions as a stress hormone can improve healthspan.

Its equivalent in flying insects \u2212 apolipophorin-III \u2212 shares structural and functional commonalities with APOE, suggesting the possibility of an evolutionary relationship between the proteins. In contrast to all other known species, human APOE is functionally polymorphic and possesses three major allelic variants (\u03b54, \u03b53 and \u03b52). The present review examines the current knowledge on APOE gene structure, phylogeny and APOE protein topology as well as its human isoforms. The \u03b54 allele is associated with an increased age-related disease risk but is also the ancestral form. Despite increased mortality in the elderly, \u03b54 has not become extinct and is the second-most common allele worldwide after \u03b53.

     "abstract": "Frailty is a common negative consequence of ageing. Sarcopenia, the syndrome of loss of muscle mass, quality and strength, is more common in older adults and has been considered a precursor syndrome or the physical manifestation of frailty. The pathophysiology of both syndromes is incompletely described with multiple causes, inter-relationships and complex pathways proposed. Age-associated changes to the immune system (both immunesenescence, the decline in immune function with ageing, and inflammageing, a state of chronic inflammation) have been suggested as contributors to sarcopenia and frailty but a direct causative role remains to be established. Frailty, sarcopenia and immunesenescence are commonly described in older adults but are not ubiquitous to ageing. There is evidence that all three conditions are reversible and all three appear to share common inflammatory drivers. It is unclear whether frailty, sarcopenia and immunesenescence are separate entities that co-occur due to coincidental or potentially confounding factors, or whether they are more intimately linked by the same underlying cellular mechanisms. This review explores these possibilities focusing on innate immunity, and in particular associations with neutrophil dysfunction, inflammation and known mechanisms described to date. Furthermore, we consider whether the age-related decline in immune cell function (such as neutrophil migration), increased inflammation and the dysregulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway in neutrophils could contribute pathogenically to sarcopenia and frailty.",

     "abstract": "A wide array of cell signaling mediators and their interactions play vital roles in neuroinflammation associated with ischemia, brain trauma, developmental disorders and age-related neurodegeneration. Along with neurons, microglia and astrocytes are also affected by the inflammatory cascade by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen species. The release of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to neural dysfunction may be helpful, neutral or even deleterious to normal cellular survival. Moreover, the important role of NF-\u03baB factors in the central nervous system (CNS) through toll-like receptor (TLR) activation has been well established. This review demonstrates recent findings regarding therapeutic aspects of polyphenolic compounds for the treatment of neuroinflammation, with the aim of regulating TLR4. Polyphenols including flavonoids, phenolic acids, phenolic alcohols, stilbenes and lignans, can target TLR4 signaling pathways in multiple ways. Toll interacting protein expression could be modulated by epigallocatechin-3-gallate. Resveratrol may also exert neuroprotective effects via the TLR4/NF-\u03baB/STAT signaling cascade. Its role in activation of cascade via interfering with TLR4 oligomerization upon receptor stimulation has also been reported. Curcumin, another polyphenol, can suppress overexpression of inflammatory mediators via inhibiting the TLR4-MAPK/NF-\u03baB pathway. It can also reduce neuronal apoptosis via a mechanism concerning the TLR4/MyD88/NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in microglia/macrophages. Despite a symphony of in vivo and in vitro studies, many molecular and pharmacological aspects of neuroinflammation remain unclear. It is proposed that natural compounds targeting TLR4 may serve as important pharmacophores for the development of potent drugs for the treatment of neurological disorders.",

     "abstract": "In addition to the deposition of \u03b2-amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles composed of aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau are one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Until now, our understanding about the natural history and topography of tau deposition has only been based on post-mortem and cerebrospinal fluid studies, and evidence continues to implicate tau as a central driver of downstream neurodegenerative processes and cognitive decline. Recently, it has become possible to assess the regional distribution and severity of tau burden in vivo with the development of novel radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In this article, we provide a comprehensive discussion of tau pathophysiology, its quantification with novel PET radiotracers, as well as a systematic review of tau PET imaging in normal aging and various dementia conditions: mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, and Lewy body dementia. We discuss the main findings in relation to group differences, clinical-cognitive correlations of tau PET, and multi-modal relationships among tau PET and other pathological markers. Collectively, the small but growing literature of tau PET has yielded consistent anatomical patterns of tau accumulation that recapitulate post-mortem distribution of neurofibrillary tangles which correlate with cognitive functions and other markers of pathology. In general, AD is characterised by increased tracer retention in the inferior temporal lobe, extending into the frontal and parietal regions in more severe cases. It is also noted that the spatial topography of tau accumulation is markedly distinct to that of amyloid burden in aging and AD. Tau PET imaging has also revealed characteristic spatial patterns among various non-AD tauopathies, supporting its potential role for differential diagnosis. Finally, we propose novel directions for future tau research, including (a) longitudinal imaging in preclinical dementia, (b) multi-modal mapping of tau pathology onto other pathological processes such as neuroinflammation, and (c) the need for more validation studies against post-mortem samples of the same subjects.",

This degenerative disease is a major and increasing cause of vision loss in the elderly in developed countries, primarily due to the profound accumulation of intra- and extracellular waste: lipofuscin and drusen. An abundance of reactive oxygen species is produced in the retina since this tissue has a high oxygen demand and contains mitochondria-rich cells. The retina is exposed to light and it also houses many photoactive molecules. These factors are clearly reflected in both the autophagy and DNA damage rates, and in both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the associations between depression and frailty.Two authors searched major electronic databases from inception until November-2016 for cross-sectional/longitudinal studies investigating depression and frailty. The strength of the reciprocal associations between frailty and depression was assessed through odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for potential confounders.From 2306 non duplicated hits, 24 studies were included. The overall prevalence of depression in 8023 people with frailty was 38.60% (95% CI 30.07\u201347.10, I2\u00a0=\u00a094%). Those with frailty were at increased odds of having depression (OR adjusted for publication bias 4.42, 95%CI 2.66\u20137.35, k\u00a0=\u00a011), also after adjusting for potential confounders (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.64; 95%CI: 1.59\u20134.37, I2\u00a0=\u00a055%, k\u00a0=\u00a04).

     "abstract": "It is well established that the neurodegenerative process of Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins many years before symptom onset. This preclinical phase provides a crucial time-window for therapeutic intervention, though this requires biomarkers that could evaluate the efficacy of future disease-modification treatments in asymptomatic individuals. The last decade has witnessed a proliferation of studies characterizing the temporal sequence of the earliest functional and structural brain imaging changes in AD. These efforts have focused on studying individuals who are highly vulnerable to develop AD, such as those with familial genetic mutations, susceptibility genes (i.e. apolipoprotein epsilon-4 allele), and/or a positive family history of AD. In this paper, we review the rapidly growing literature of functional imaging changes in cognitively intact individuals who are middle-aged: positron emission tomography (PET) studies of amyloid deposition, glucose metabolism, as well as arterial spin labeling (ASL), task-dependent, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies. The prevailing evidence points to early brain functional changes in the relative absence of cognitive impairment and structural atrophy, although there is marked variability in the directionality of the changes, which could, in turn, be related to antagonistic pleiotropy early in life. A common theme across studies relates to the spatial extent of these changes, most of which overlap with brain regions that are implicated in established AD. Notwithstanding several methodological caveats, functional imaging techniques could be preferentially sensitive to the earliest events of AD pathology prior to macroscopic grey matter loss and clinical manifestations of AD. We conclude that while these techniques have great potential to serve as biomarkers to identify at-risk individuals, more longitudinal studies with greater sample size and robust correction for multiple comparisons are still warranted to establish their utility.",

     "abstract": "Impaired immune function has been implicated in the declining health and higher incidence of cancer in the elderly. However, age-related changes to immunity are not completely understood. Neutrophils and macrophages represent the first line of defence yet their ability to phagocytose pathogens decrease with aging. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are critical in eliminating tumors, but T cell function is also compromised with aging. T cell responses can be regulated by macrophages and may depend on the functional phenotype macrophages adopt in response to microenvironmental signals. This can range from pro-inflammatory, anti-tumorigenic M1 to anti-inflammatory, pro-tumorigenic M2 macrophages. Macrophages in healthy elderly adipose and hepatic tissue exhibit a more pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype compared to young hosts whilst immunosuppressive M2 macrophages increase in elderly lymphoid tissues, lung and muscle. These M2-like macrophages demonstrate altered responses to stimuli. Recent studies suggest that neutrophils also regulate T cell function and, like macrophages, neutrophil function is modulated with aging. It is possible that age-modified tissue-specific macrophages and neutrophils contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation that is associated with dysregulated macrophage-mediated immunosuppression, which together are responsible for development of multiple pathologies, including cancer. This review discusses recent advances in macrophage and neutrophil biology in healthy aging and cancer.",

One possible contributor to this accelerated aging is cellular senescence, an age-associated response that can occur prematurely in response to stress, and that is emerging as a contributor to disease and aging. HIV patients experience several stressors such as the virus itself, antiretroviral drugs and to a lesser extent, substance abuse that can induce cellular senescence.

     "abstract": "Ageing is a complex process characterized by a general decline in physiological functions with increasing morbidity and mortality. The most important aspect of ageing is the chronic inflammatory status, named \u201cinflamm-ageing\u201d, strictly associated with the deterioration of the immune function, termed \u201cimmunosenescence\u201d. Both are causes of increased susceptibility of elderly to infectious diseases, cancer, dementia, cardiovascular diseases and autoimmunity, and of a decreased response to vaccination. It has been widely demonstrated that ageing has a strong impact on the remodelling of the B cell branch of immune system. The first evident effect is the significant decrease in circulating B cells, primarily due to the reduction of new B cell coming from bone marrow (BM) progenitors, as inflammation directly impacts on B lymphopoiesis. Besides, in aged individuals, there is a shift from na\u00efve to memory immunoglobulins production, accompanied by the impaired ability to produce high affinity protective antibodies against newly encountered antigens. This is accompanied by the increase of expanded clones of B cells, which correlates with poor health status. Age-related modifications also occur in na\u00efve/memory B cells subsets. Indeed, in the elderly, there is a reduction of na\u00efve B cells, accompanied by the expansion of memory B cells that show a senescence-associated phenotype. Finally, elderly show the impaired ability of memory B cells to differentiate into plasma cells. It can be concluded that inflammation is the leading cause of the age-related impairment of B cell compartment, which play certainly a key role in the development of age-related diseases. This makes study of B cells in the aged an important tool for monitoring immunosenescence, chronic inflammatory disorders and the effectiveness of vaccines or pharmacological therapies.",

     "abstract": "The primary causative event in the development of prion diseases is the misfolding of the normal prion protein (PrPC) into an ensemble of altered conformers (herein collectively denoted as PrPSc) that accumulate in the brain. Prominent amongst currently unresolved key aspects underpinning prion disease pathogenesis is whether transmission and toxicity are sub-served by different molecular species of PrPSc, which may directly impact on the development of effective targeted treatments. The use of murine models of prion disease has been of fundamental importance for probing the relationship between hypothesised \u201cneurotoxic\u201d and \u201ctransmissible\u201d PrPSc and the associated kinetic profiles of their production during disease evolution, but unfortunately consensus has not been achieved. Recent in vivo studies have led to formulation of the \u201ctwo-phase\u201d hypothesis, which postulates that there is first an exponential increase in transmitting PrPSc species followed by an abrupt transition to propagation of neurotoxic PrPSc species. Such observations however, appear inconsistent with previous in vivo murine studies employing detailed time-course behavioural testing, wherein evidence of neurotoxicity could be detected early in disease progression. This review analyses the contributions of in vivo murine models attempting to provide insights into the relationship between transmitting and neurotoxic PrPSc species and explores possible refinements to the \u201ctwo-phase hypothesis\u201d, that better accommodate the available historical and recent evidence.",

     "abstract": "Alternative splicing is a co-transcriptional process, which allows for the production of multiple transcripts from a single gene and is emerging as an important control point for gene expression. Alternatively expressed isoforms often have antagonistic function and differential temporal or spatial expression patterns, yielding enormous plasticity and adaptability to cells and increasing their ability to respond to environmental challenge. The regulation of alternative splicing is critical for numerous cellular functions in both pathological and physiological conditions, and deregulated alternative splicing is a key feature of common chronic diseases. Isoform choice is controlled by a battery of splicing regulatory proteins, which include the serine arginine rich (SRSF) proteins and the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) classes of genes. These important splicing regulators have been implicated in age-related disease, and in the ageing process itself. This review will outline the important contribution of splicing regulator proteins to ageing and age-related disease.",

However, the effect of pharmacological treatment is not satisfying. Therefore, we analyzed the efficacy of music therapy in elderly dementia patients, and if so, whether music therapy can be used as first-line non-pharmacological treatment. A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed, EMbase and the Cochrane Library from inception to September 2016. A total of 34 studies (42 analyses, 1757 subjects) were included; all of them had an acceptable quality based on the PEDro and CASP scale scores. Studies based on any type of dementia patient were combined and analyzed by subgroup. The standardized mean difference was \u22120.42 (-0.74 to \u22120.11) for disruptive behavior and 0.20 (-0.09 to 0.49) for cognitive function as primary outcomes in random effect models using controls as the comparator; the secondary outcomes were depressive score, anxiety and quality of life. No evidence of publication bias was found based on Begg\u2019s and Egger\u2019s test. The meta-analysis confirmed that the baseline differences between the two groups were balanced. Subgroup analyses showed that disease sub-type, intervention method, comparator, subject location, trial design, trial period and outcome measure instrument made little difference in outcomes. The meta-regression may have identified the causes of heterogeneity as the intervention method, comparator and trial design. Music therapy was effective when patients received interactive therapy with a compared group. There was positive evidence to support the use of music therapy to treat disruptive behavior and anxiety; there were positive trends supporting the use of music therapy for the treatment of cognitive function, depression and quality of life.

However, the conclusions have been inconsistent. A meta-analysis of whole-brain rs-fMRI studies that measured differences in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) between aMCI patients and healthy controls was conducted using the Seed-based d Mapping software package. Twelve studies reporting 14 datasets were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to healthy controls, patients with aMCI showed decreased ALFFs in the bilateral precuneus/posterior cingulate cortices, bilateral frontoinsular cortices, left occipitotemporal cortex, and right supramarginal gyrus and increased ALFFs in the right lingual gyrus, left middle occipital gyrus, left hippocampus, and left inferior temporal gyrus. A meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the increased severity of cognitive impairment in aMCI patients was associated with greater decreases in ALFFs in the cuneus/precuneus cortices. Our comprehensive meta-analysis suggests that aMCI is associated with widespread aberrant regional spontaneous brain activity, predominantly involving the default mode, salience, and visual networks, which contributes to understanding its pathophysiology.",

     "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by a general decline in the physiological functions of the body with the deteriorating organ systems. Brain is no exception to this and deficits in cognitive functions are quite common in advanced aging. Though a variety of age-related alterations are observed in the structure and function throughout the brain, certain regions show selective vulnerability. Medial temporal lobe, especially the hippocampus, is one such preferentially vulnerable region and is a crucial structure involved in the learning and long-term memory functions. Hippocampal synaptic plasticity, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression (LTD), are candidate cellular correlates of learning and memory and alterations in these properties have been well documented in aging. A related phenomenon called synaptic tagging and capture (STC) has been proposed as a mechanism for cellular memory consolidation and to account for temporal association of memories. Mounting evidences from behavioral settings suggest that STC could be a physiological phenomenon. In this article, we review the recent data concerning STC and provide a framework for how alterations in STC-related mechanisms could contribute to the age-associated memory impairments. The enormity of impairment in learning and memory functions demands an understanding of age-associated memory deficits at the fundamental level given its impact in the everyday tasks, thereby in the quality of life. Such an understanding is also crucial for designing interventions and preventive measures for successful brain aging.",

Since the execution process lacks the nuclear and mitochondrial events in apoptosis, it has been referred to as quasi-apoptosis or eryptosis. Several studies on molecular mechanisms underlying death of erythrocytes have been reported. The data has generated a non-cohesive sketch of the process. The lacunae in the present knowledge need to be filled to gain deeper insight into the mechanism of physiological ageing and death of erythrocytes, as well as the effect of age of organism on RBCs survival.

We thus aimed to meta-analytically evaluate the evidence of frailty and pre-frailty as risk factors for CVD. Two reviewers selected all studies comparing data about CVD prevalence or incidence rates between frail/pre-frail vs. robust. The association between frailty status and CVD in cross-sectional studies was explored by calculating and pooling crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) \u00b195% confidence intervals (CIs); the data from longitudinal studies were pooled using the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Eighteen cohorts with a total of 31,343 participants were meta-analyzed. Using estimates from 10 cross-sectional cohorts, both frailty and pre-frailty were associated with higher odds of CVD than robust participants. Longitudinal data were obtained from 6 prospective cohort studies. After a median follow-up of 4.4 years, we identified an increased risk for faster onset of any-type CVD in the frail (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.70 [95%CI, 1.18\u20132.45]; I2\u00a0=\u00a066%) and pre-frail (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.23 [95%CI, 1.07\u20131.36]; I2\u00a0=\u00a067%) vs. robust groups. Similar results were apparent for time to CVD mortality in the frail and pre-frail groups.

The vascular phenotype of Klotho deficiency features medial calcification, intima hyperplasia, endothelial dysfunction, arterial stiffening, hypertension, and impaired angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, with characteristics similar to aged human arteries.Klotho-deficient phenotypes can be prevented and rescued by Klotho gene expression or protein supplementation. High phosphate levels are likely to be directly pathogenic and are a prerequisite for medial calcification, but more important determinants are pathways that regulate cellular senescence, suggesting that deficiency of Klotho renders cells susceptible to phosphate toxicity. Overexpression of Klotho is shown to ameliorate medial calcification, endothelial dysfunction, and hypertension.Endogenous vascular Klotho expression is a controversial subject and, currently, no compelling evidence exists that supports the existence of vascular membrane-bound Klotho expression, as expressed in kidney. In vitro, Klotho has been shown to decrease oxidative stress and apoptosis in both SMCs and ECs, to reduce SMC calcification, to maintain the contractile SMC phenotype, and to prevent \u03bc-calpain overactivation in ECs.Klotho has many protective effects with regard to the vasculature and constitutes a very promising therapeutic target.

A large number of neurodegenerative diseases in humans, including Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s, Huntington\u2019s, and prion diseases, are primarily caused by protein misfolding and aggregation. Notably, the cellular system is equipped with a protein quality control system encompassing chaperones, ubiquitin proteasome system, and autophagy, as a defense mechanism that monitors protein folding and eliminates inappropriately folded proteins. As the intrinsic molecular mechanisms of protein misfolding become more clearly understood, the novel therapeutic approaches in this arena are gaining considerable interest. The present review will describe the chaperones network and different approaches as the therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases.

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia, an age-associated decline in skeletal muscle mass coupled with functional deterioration, may be exacerbated by obesity leading to higher disability, frailty, morbidity and mortality rates. In the combination of sarcopenia and obesity, the state called sarcopenic obesity (SOB), some key age- and obesity-mediated factors and pathways may aggravate sarcopenia. This review will analyze the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of SOB. In obese adipose tissue (AT), adipocytes undergo hypertrophy, hyperplasia and activation resulted in accumulation of pro-inflammatory macrophages and other immune cells as well as dysregulated production of various adipokines that together with senescent cells and the immune cell-released cytokines and chemokines create a local pro-inflammatory status. In addition, obese AT is characterized by excessive production and disturbed capacity to store lipids, which accumulate ectopically in skeletal muscle. These intramuscular lipids and their derivatives induce mitochondrial dysfunction characterized by impaired \u03b2-oxidation capacity and increased reactive oxygen species formation providing lipotoxic environment and insulin resistance as well as enhanced secretion of some pro-inflammatory myokines capable of inducing muscle dysfunction by auto/paracrine manner. In turn, by endocrine manner, these myokines may exacerbate AT inflammation and also support chronic low grade systemic inflammation (inflammaging), overall establishing a detrimental vicious circle maintaining AT and skeletal muscle inflammation, thus triggering and supporting SOB development. Under these circumstances, we believe that AT inflammation dominates over skeletal muscle inflammation.

The precise cause of the neuronal degeneration underlying these disorders, and indeed normal brain ageing remains however elusive. Considering the limits of existing preventive methods, there is a desire to develop effective and safe strategies. Growing preclinical and clinical research in healthy individuals or at the early stage of cognitive decline has demonstrated the beneficial impact of nutrition on cognitive functions. The present review is the most recent in a series produced by the Nutrition and Mental Performance Task Force under the auspice of the International Life Sciences Institute Europe (ILSI Europe). The latest scientific advances specific to how dietary nutrients and non-nutrient may affect cognitive ageing are presented. Furthermore, several key points related to mechanisms contributing to brain ageing, pathological conditions affecting brain function, and brain biomarkers are also discussed. Overall, findings are inconsistent and fragmented and more research is warranted to determine the underlying mechanisms and to establish dose-response relationships for optimal brain maintenance in different population subgroups. Such approaches are likely to provide the necessary evidence to develop research portfolios that will inform about new dietary recommendations on how to prevent cognitive decline.",

In its wake is a robust pipeline of therapeutic interventions that have been demonstrated to extend lifespan or healthspan of preclinical models, including rapalogs, antioxidants, anti-inflammatory agents, and senolytics. This ensures that if the TAME trial is successful, numerous additional clinical trials are apt to follow. But a significant impediment to these trials remains the question of what endpoints should be measured? The design of the TAME trial very cleverly skirts around this based on the fact that there are decades of data on metformin in humans, providing unequaled clarity of what endpoints are most likely to yield a positive outcome. But for a new chemical entity, knowing what endpoints to measure remains a formidable challenge. For economy\u2019s sake, and to achieve results in a reasonable time frame, surrogate markers of lifespan and healthy aging are desperately needed.

     "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed a proliferation of neuroimaging studies characterising brain changes associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), where both widespread atrophy and \u2018signature\u2019 brain regions have been implicated. In parallel, a prolonged latency period has been established in AD, with abnormal cerebral changes beginning many years before symptom onset. This raises the possibility of early therapeutic intervention, even before symptoms, when treatments could have the greatest effect on disease-course modification. Two important prerequisites of this endeavour are (1) accurate characterisation or risk stratification and (2) monitoring of progression using neuroimaging outcomes as a surrogate biomarker in those without symptoms but who will develop AD, here referred to as preclinical AD. Structural neuroimaging modalities have been used to identify brain changes related to risk factors for AD, such as familial genetic mutations, risk genes (for example apolipoprotein epsilon-4 allele), and/or family history. In this review, we summarise structural imaging findings in preclinical AD. Overall, the literature suggests early vulnerability in characteristic regions, such as the medial temporal lobe structures and the precuneus, as well as white matter tracts in the fornix, cingulum and corpus callosum. We conclude that while structural markers are promising, more research and validation studies are needed before future secondary prevention trials can adopt structural imaging biomarkers as either stratification or surrogate biomarkers.",

Although the mechanisms of AD development are still being debated, a series of evidence supports the idea that metals, such as copper, iron, zinc, magnesium and aluminium, are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. In particular, the processes of A\u03b2 deposition in senile plaques (SP) and the inclusion of phosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are markedly influenced by alterations in the homeostasis of the aforementioned metal ions. Moreover, the mechanisms of oxidative stress, synaptic plasticity, neurotoxicity, autophagy and apoptosis mediate the effects of metal ions-induced the aggregation state of A\u03b2 and phosphorylated tau on AD development. More importantly, imbalance of these mechanisms finally caused cognitive decline in different experiment models. Collectively, reconstructing the signaling network that regulates AD progression by metal ions may provide novel insights for developing chelators specific for metal ions to combat AD.",

In this regard, the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) line is a particularly good model for studying the effects of aging on cardiovascular health. Accumulating evidence suggests that this model may shed light on age-associated cardiac and vascular dysfunction and disease. These animals manifest evidence of inflammation, oxidative stress and adverse cardiac remodeling that may recapitulate processes involved in human disease. Early alterations in oxidative damage promote endoplasmic reticulum stress to trigger apoptosis and cytokine production in this genetically susceptible mouse strain. Conversely, pharmacological treatments that reduce inflammation and oxidative stress improve cardiac function in these animals. Therefore, the SAMP8 mouse model provides an exciting opportunity to expand our knowledge of aging in cardiovascular disease and the potential identification of novel targets of treatment. Herein, we review the previous studies performed in SAMP8 mice that provide insight into age-related cardiovascular alterations.",

Indeed, SIRT6 improves longevity, similarly to the founding yeast member, silent information regulator-2 (Sir2), and modulates genome stability, telomere integrity, transcription, and DNA repair. Its deficiency is associated with chronic inflammation, diabetes, cardiac hypertrophy, obesity, liver dysfunction, muscle/adipocyte disorders, and cancer. Besides, pieces of evidence showed that SIRT6 is a promoter of specific oncogenic pathways, thus disclosing its dual role regarding cancer development. Collectively, these findings suggest that multiple mechanisms, to date not entirely known, underlie the intriguing roles of SIRT6.

Previous literature showed inconsistent findings of the effect of age on the variability of force and hence a systematic review was performed. Twenty studies were included in this systematic review, of which twelve provided sufficient data to determine effect sizes for the effect of age. After determining the pooled effect size, the effect of sample size on dichotomized effect sizes (significant vs. non-significant) was determined. Also, the effect of possible determinants, age difference between age groups, dominance of investigated limb, muscle group, muscle location (proximal vs. distal and upper vs. lower extremity) and target force level on effect size (categorized as small, medium, or large) were investigated. A large pooled effect size of age was found (rtotal\u00a0=\u00a00.67, 95% CI [0.61; 0.72]). No relation between sample size and effect size significance was found, indicative of no lack of power in the studies reviewed. No relations were found of associations between age difference, upper vs. lower extremity muscle location, and dominance and effect size. Significant relations of effect size with muscle group, proximal vs. distal muscle location and target force level were found. Also, an interaction effect of muscle group and target force level was suggested. The meta-analysis results are in line with motor unit loss as the main cause of the effect of ageing on force steadiness and this effect can partially explain decreased motor performance associated with ageing.",

     "abstract": "Immunosenescence is thought to result from cellular aging and to reflect exposure to environmental stressors and antigens, including cytomegalovirus (CMV). However, not all of the features of immunosenescence are consistent with this view, and this has led to the emergence of the sister theory of \u201cinflammaging\u201d. The recently discovered diffuse tissue distribution of resident memory T cells (TRM) which don't recirculate, calls these theories into question. These cells account for most T cells residing in barrier epithelia which sit in and travel through the extracellular matrix (ECM). With almost all studies to date carried out on peripheral blood, the age-related changes of the ECM and their consequences for T cell mobility, which is crucial for the function of these cells, have been largely ignored. We propose an update of the theoretical framework of immunosenescence, based on a novel hypothesis: the increasing stiffness and cross-linking of the senescent ECM lead to a progressive immunodeficiency due to an age-related decrease in T cell mobility and eventually the death of these cells. A key element of this mechanism is the mechanical stress to which the cell cytoplasm and nucleus are subjected during passage through the ECM. This hypothesis is based on an \u201cevo-devo\u201d perspective bringing together some major characteristics of aging, to create a single interpretive framework for immunosenescence.",

The role of diet in prevention of various disorders is a well-established factor, which has an even more important role in the geriatric population. Melatonin, an indoleamine with multiple actions including antioxidant properties, has been identified in a very large number of plant species, including edible plant products and medical herbs. Among products where melatonin has been identified include wine, olive oil, tomato, beer, and others. Interestingly, consumed melatonin in plant foods or melatonin supplementation may promote health benefits by virtue of its multiple properties and it may counteract pathological conditions also related to cardiovascular disorders, carcinogenesis, neurological diseases and aging. In the present review, we summarized melatonin effects against age-related cardiac alterations and abnormalities with a special focus on heart ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and myocardial infarction.",

Healthy aging can delay onset of all age-related diseases. Genetics and epigenetics are reported to play large roles in accelerating and/or delaying the onset of age-related diseases. Cellular mechanisms of aging and age-related diseases are not completely understood. However, recent molecular biology discoveries have revealed that microRNAs (miRNAs) are potential sensors of aging and cellular senescence. Due to miRNAs capability to bind to the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of mRNA of specific genes, miRNAs can prevent the translation of specific genes. The purpose of our article is to highlight recent advancements in miRNAs and their involvement in cellular changes in aging and senescence.

Newly emerged research indicates that altered autophagy flux functionality is involved in neurodegeneration of the aged brain, chronic neurological diseases, and after traumatic and ischemic brain injuries. In search to identify neuroprotective agents that may reduce oxidative stress and stimulate autophagy, one particular neuroprotective agent docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) presents unique functions in reducing ER and oxidative stress and modulating autophagy.

UPP dysfunction occurs with normal aging and is associated with abnormal accumulation of protein aggregates within neurons in neurodegenerative diseases. Ischemia disrupts UPP function and thus may contribute to UPP dysfunction seen in the aging brain and in neurodegenerative diseases. Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), an important component of the UPP in the neuron, is covalently modified and its activity inhibited by reactive lipids produced after ischemia. As a result, degradation of toxic proteins is impaired which may exacerbate neuronal function and cell death in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. Preserving or restoring UCHL1 activity may be an effective therapeutic strategy in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases.",

In addition to gray matter dysfunction, the plasticity and repair capacity of white matter also decrease with aging and contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Aging not only renders patients more susceptible to these disorders, but also attenuates their self-repair capabilities.

     "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI), advanced age, and cerebral vascular disease are factors conferring increased risk for late onset Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). These conditions are also related pathologically through multiple interacting mechanisms. The hallmark pathology of AD consists of pathological aggregates of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides and tau proteins. These molecules are also involved in neuropathology of several other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, and are under intense investigation in the aftermath of TBI as potential contributors to the risk for developing AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The pathology of TBI is complex and dependent on injury severity, age-at-injury, and length of time between injury and neuropathological evaluation. In addition, the mechanisms influencing pathology and recovery after TBI likely involve genetic/epigenetic factors as well as additional disorders or comorbid states related to age and central and peripheral vascular health. In this regard, dysfunction of the aging neurovascular system could be an important link between TBI and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, either as a precipitating event or related to accumulation of AD-like pathology which is amplified in the context of aging. Thus with advanced age and vascular dysfunction, TBI can trigger self-propagating cycles of neuronal injury, pathological protein aggregation, and synaptic loss resulting in chronic neurodegenerative disease. In this review we discuss evidence supporting TBI and aging as dual, interacting risk factors for AD, and the role of A\u03b2 and cerebral vascular dysfunction in this relationship. Evidence is discussed that A\u03b2 is involved in cyto- and synapto-toxicity after severe TBI, and that its chronic effects are potentiated by aging and impaired cerebral vascular function. From a therapeutic perspective, we emphasize that in the fields of TBI- and aging-related neurodegeneration protective strategies should include preservation of neurovascular function.",

It is an autosomal recessive disorder, with a prevalence of approximately 2.5 per million. There are several phenotypes (1\u20133) and two complementation groups (CSA and CSB), and CS overlaps with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). It has been considered a progeria, and many of the clinical features resemble accelerated aging. As such, the study of CS affords an opportunity to better understand the underlying mechanisms of aging. The molecular basis of CS has traditionally been ascribed to defects in transcription and transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER). However, recent work suggests that defects in base excision DNA repair and mitochondrial functions may also play key roles. This opens up the possibility for molecular interventions in CS, and by extrapolation, possibly in aging.",

Alterations in lamin A and C that disrupt the integrity of the nuclear lamina affect a whole repertoire of nuclear functions, causing cellular decline. In humans, hundreds of mutations in the LMNA gene have been identified and correlated with over a dozen degenerative disorders, referred to as laminopathies. These diseases include neuropathies, muscular dystrophies, lipodystrophies, and premature aging diseases. This review focuses on one of the most severe laminopathies, Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), which is caused by aberrant splicing of the LMNA gene and expression of a mutant product called progerin. Here, we discuss current views about the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the pathophysiology of this devastating disease, as well as the strategies being tested in vitro and in vivo to counteract progerin toxicity. In particular, progerin accumulation elicits nuclear morphological abnormalities, misregulated gene expression, defects in DNA repair, telomere shortening, and genomic instability, all of which limit cellular proliferative capacity. In patients harboring this mutation, a severe premature aging disease develops during childhood. Interestingly, progerin is also produced in senescent cells and cells from old individuals, suggesting that progerin accumulation might be a factor in physiological aging. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms whereby progerin expression leads to HGPS is an emergent area of research, which could bring us closer to understanding the pathology of aging.",

The excessive homologous recombination drives the development in BS of the many types of cancers that affect persons in the normal population.

Changes in the expression and secretion of CysC in the brain have been described in various neurological disorders and in animal models of neurodegeneration, underscoring a role for CysC in these conditions. In the brain, multiple in vitro and in vivo findings have demonstrated that CysC plays protective roles via pathways that depend upon the inhibition of endosomal-lysosomal pathway cysteine proteases, such as cathepsin B (Cat B), via the induction of cellular autophagy, via the induction of cell proliferation, or via the inhibition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) aggregation.

     "abstract": "Microglia, the main phagocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), are involved in the surveillance and maintenance of nervous tissue. During normal tissue homeostasis, microglia migrates within the CNS, phagocytose dead cells and tissue debris, and modulate synapse pruning and spine formation via controlled phagocytosis. In the event of an invasion by a foreign body, microglia are able to phagocytose the invading pathogen and process it proteolytically for antigen presentation. Internalized substrates are incorporated and sorted within the endocytic pathway and thereafter transported via complex vesicular routes. When targeted for degradation, substrates are delivered to acidic late endosomes and lysosomes. In these, the enzymatic degradation relies on pH and enzyme content. Endocytosis, sorting, transport, compartment acidification and degradation are regulated by complex signaling mechanisms, and these may be altered during aging and pathology. In this review, we discuss the endocytic pathway in microglia, with insight into the mechanisms controlling lysosomal biogenesis and pH regulation. We also discuss microglial lysosome function associated with Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and the mechanisms of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) internalization and degradation. Finally, we explore some therapies currently being investigated to treat AD and their effects on microglial response to A\u03b2, with insight in those involving enhancement of lysosomal function.",

     "abstract": "Lysosomal storage diseases and diseases of ageing share many features both at the physiological level and with respect to the mechanisms that underlie disease pathogenesis. Although the exact pathophysiology is not exactly the same, it is astounding how many similar pathways are altered in all of these diseases. The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the shared disease mechanisms, outlining the similarities and differences and how genetics, insight into rare diseases and functional research has changed our perspective on the causes underlying common diseases of ageing. The lysosome should no longer be considered as just the stomach of the cell or as a suicide bag, it has an emerging role in cellular signalling, nutrient sensing and recycling. The lysosome is of fundamental importance in the pathophysiology of diseases of ageing and by comparing against the LSDs we not only identify common pathways but also therapeutic targets so that ultimately more effective treatments can be developed for all neurodegenerative diseases.",

     "abstract": "Impaired protein degradation has been discussed as a cause or consequence of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. More recently, evidence accumulated that dysfunctional protein degradation may play a role in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Since in almost all neurodegenerative diseases, protein aggregates are disease-defining hallmarks, it is most likely that impaired protein degradation contributes to disease onset and progression. In the majority of FTD cases, the pathological protein aggregates contain either microtubuleassociated protein tau or TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP)-43. Aggregates are also positive for ubiquitin and p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) indicating that these aggregates are targeted for degradation. FTD-linked mutations in genes encoding three autophagy adaptor proteins, p62/SQSTM1, ubiquilin 2 and optineurin, indicate that impaired autophagy might cause FTD. Furthermore, the strongest evidence for lysosomal impairment in FTD is provided by the progranulin (GRN) gene, which is linked to FTD and neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. In this review, we summarize the observations that have been made during the last years linking the accumulation of disease-associated proteins in FTD to impaired protein degradation pathways. In addition, we take resent findings for nucleocytoplasmic transport defects of TDP-43, as discussed for hexanucleotide repeat expansions in C9orf72 into account and provide a hypothesis how the interplay of altered nuclear transport and protein degradation leads to the accumulation of protein deposits.",

     "abstract": "Neurons are highly specialized post-mitotic cells, so their homeostasis and survival depend on the tightly-regulated, continuous protein degradation, synthesis, and turnover. In neurons, autophagy is indispensable to facilitate recycling of long-lived, damaged proteins and organelles in a lysosome-dependent manner. Since lysosomal proteolysis under basal conditions performs an essential housekeeping function, inhibition of the proteolysis exacerbates level of neurodegeneration. The latter is characterized by an accumulation of abnormal proteins or organelles within autophagic vacuoles which reveal as \u2018granulo-vacuolar degenerations\u2019 on microscopy. Heat-shock protein70.1 (Hsp70.1), as a means of molecular chaperone and lysosomal stabilizer, is a potent survival protein that confers neuroprotection against diverse stimuli, but its depletion induces neurodegeneration via autophagy failure. In response to hydroxynonenal generated from linoleic or arachidonic acids by the reactive oxygen species, a specific oxidative injury \u2018carbonylation' occurs at the key site Arg469 of Hsp70.1. Oxidative stress-induced carbonylation of Hsp70.1, in coordination with the calpain-mediated cleavage, leads to lysosomal destabilization/rupture and release of cathepsins with the resultant neuronal death. Hsp70.1 carbonylation which occurs anywhere in the brain is indispensable for neuronal death, but extent of calpain activation should be more crucial for determining the cell death fate. Importantly, not only acute ischemia during stroke but also chronic ischemia due to ageing may cause calpain activation. Here, role of Hsp70.1-mediated lysosomal rupture is discussed by comparing ischemic and Alzheimer neuronal death. A common neuronal death cascade may exist between cerebral ischemia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

Eligible studies were controlled trials examining the effects of combined intervention on cognition in older adults without known cognitive impairment. Twenty interventional studies comprising 2667 participants were included. Results showed that the overall effect size for combined intervention versus control group was 0.29 (random effects model, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Compared to physical exercise, combined intervention produced greater effects on overall effect size (0.22, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), while no significant difference was found between combined intervention and cognitive intervention. Effects of combined intervention were moderated by age of participants, intervention frequency and setting.

During recent decades there have been major advances in understanding the biology of aging, and the development of nutritional interventions that delay aging including calorie restriction (CR) and intermittent fasting (IF), and chemicals that influence pathways linking nutrition and aging processes. CR influences brain aging in many animal models and recent findings suggest that dietary interventions can influence brain health and dementia in older humans. The role of individual macronutrients in brain aging also has been studied, with conflicting results about the effects of dietary protein and carbohydrates. A new approach known as the Geometric Framework (GF) has been used to unravel the complex interactions between macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) and total energy on outcomes such as aging. These studies have shown that low-protein, high-carbohydrate (LPHC) diets are optimal for lifespan in ad libitum fed animals, while total calories have minimal effect once macronutrients are taken into account. One of the primary purposes of this review is to explore the notion that macronutrients may have a more translational potential than CR and IF in humans, and therefore there is a pressing need to use GF to study the impact of diet on brain aging. Furthermore, given the growing recognition of the role of aging biology in dementia, such studies might provide a new approach for dietary interventions for optimizing brain health and preventing dementia in older people.",

Major progresses in the field concern the segmentation of the hippocampus with novel manual and automatic segmentation approaches, which might soon enable to assess also hippocampal subfields. Advancements in quantification of hippocampal volumetry might pave the way to its broader use as outcome marker in AD clinical trials. Patterns of cortical atrophy have been shown to accurately track disease progression and seem promising in distinguishing among AD subtypes. Disease progression has also been associated with changes in white matter tracts.

Studies in another framework where age-related neural alteration is considered adaptation to the environmental change are recently burgeoning and appear largely categorized into three domains. The age-related increase in activation of the sensorimotor network may reflect the alteration of the peripheral sensorimotor systems. The increased susceptibility of the network for the mental-state inference to the socioemotional significance may be explained by the age-related motivational shift due to the altered social perception. The age-related change in activation of the self-referential network may be relevant to the focused positive self-concept of elderly driven by a similar motivational shift.

     "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to present a selective and concise summary of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) in dementia imaging. FDG PET is used to visualize a downstream topographical marker that indicates the distribution of neural injury or synaptic dysfunction, and can identify distinct phenotypes of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD), Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. AD dementia shows hypometabolism in the parietotemporal association area, posterior cingulate, and precuneus. Hypometabolism in the inferior parietal lobe and posterior cingulate/precuneus is a predictor of cognitive decline from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD dementia. FDG PET may also predict conversion of cognitively normal individuals to those with MCI. Age-related hypometabolism is observed mainly in the anterior cingulate and anterior temporal lobe, along with regional atrophy. Voxel-based statistical analyses, such as statistical parametric mapping or three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection, improve the diagnostic performance of imaging of dementias. The potential of FDG PET in future clinical and methodological studies should be exploited further.",

     "abstract": "The formation of senile plaques followed by the deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 is the earliest pathological change in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Thus, the detection of senile plaques remains the most important early diagnostic indicator of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Amyloid imaging is a noninvasive technique for visualizing senile plaques in the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients using positron emission tomography (PET) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because fluorine-19 (19F) displays an intense nuclear magnetic resonance signal and is almost non-existent in the body, targets are detected with a higher signal-to-noise ratio using appropriate fluorinated contrast agents. The recent introduction of high-field MRI allows us to detect amyloid depositions in the brain of living mouse using 19F-MRI. So far, at least three probes have been reported to detect amyloid deposition in the brain of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer\u2019s disease; (E,E)-1-fluoro-2,5-bis-(3-hydroxycarbonyl-4-hydroxy)styrylbenzene (FSB), 1,7-bis(4\u2032-hydroxy-3\u2032-trifluoromethoxyphenyl)-4-methoxycarbonylethyl-1,6-heptadiene3,5-dione (FMeC1, Shiga-Y5) and 6-(3\u2032,6\u2032,9\u2032,15\u2032,18\u2032,21\u2032-heptaoxa-23\u2032,23\u2032,23\u2032-trifluorotricosanyloxy)-2-(4\u2032-dimethylaminostyryl)benzoxazole (XP7, Shiga-X22).

These cells can negatively affect neighbouring cells through an altered secretory phenotype: the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). The SASP induces senescence in healthy cells, promotes tumour formation and progression, and contributes to other age-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, immune-senescence and neurodegeneration. Removal of senescent cells was recently demonstrated to delay age-related degeneration and extend lifespan.To better understand cell aging and to reap the benefits of senescent cell removal, it is necessary to have a reliable biomarker to identify these cells. Following an introduction to cellular senescence, we discuss several classes of biomarkers in the context of their utility in identifying and/or removing senescent cells from tissues. Although senescence can be induced by a variety of stimuli, senescent cells share some characteristics that enable their identification both in vitro and in vivo. Nevertheless, it may prove difficult to identify a single biomarker capable of distinguishing senescence in all cell types. Therefore, this will not be a comprehensive review of all senescence biomarkers but rather an outlook on technologies and markers that are most suitable to identify and isolate senescent cells.",

In addition, ageing is characterized by the progressive deterioration of immune cells and a decline in the activation of the immune response. This results in a loss of the primary function of the immune system, which is eliminating damaged/senescent cells and neutralizing potential sources of harmful inflammatory reactions.In this review, we discuss cellular senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) of endothelial cells and summarize the link between endothelial cells and immunosenescence. We describe the possibility that age-related changes in Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and microRNAs can affect the phenotypes of senescent endothelial cells and immune cells via a negative feedback loop aimed at restraining the excessive pro-inflammatory response. This review also addresses the following questions: how do senescent endothelial cells influence ageing or age-related changes in the inflammatory burden; what is the connection between ECs and immunosenescence, and what are the crucial hypothetical pathways linking endothelial cells and the immune system during ageing.",

Both the anterior and posterior segments of the eye are affected, extensive damage being detectable in the trabecular meshwork and the inner retina-central visual pathway complex. Oxidative stress is claimed to be mainly responsible for molecular damage in the anterior chamber. Indeed, oxidation harms the trabecular meshwork, leading eventually to endothelial cell decay, tissue malfunction, subclinical inflammation, changes in the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton, altered motility, reduced outflow facility and (ultimately) increased IOP. Moreover, free radicals are involved in aging and can be produced in the brain (as well as in the eye) as a result of ischemia, leading to oxidation of the surrounding neurons. Glaucoma-related cell death occurs by means of apoptosis, and apoptosis is triggered by oxidative stress via (a) mitochondrial damage, (b) inflammation, (c) endothelial dysregulation and dysfunction, and (d) hypoxia. The proteomics of the aqueous humor is significantly altered in glaucoma as a result of oxidation-induced trabecular damage.

Ageing decreases the inner and outer macular thickness, and the overall macular thickness and volume. Studies find that specific retinal layers at specific locations seem to be the contributor to these changes.

AMPK signaling controls an integrated signaling network which is involved in the regulation of healthspan and lifespan e.g. via FoxO, mTOR/ULK1, CRCT-1/CREB, and SIRT1 signaling pathways. Several studies have demonstrated that the activation capacity of AMPK signaling declines with aging, which impairs the maintenance of efficient cellular homeostasis and enhances the aging process. However, it seems that the aging process affects AMPK activation in a context-dependent manner since occasionally, it can also augment AMPK activation, possibly attributable to the type of insult and tissue homeostasis. Three protein phosphatases, PP1, PP2A, and PP2C, inhibit AMPK activation by dephosphorylating the Thr172 residue of AMPK\u03b1, required for AMPK activation. In addition, several upstream signaling pathways can phosphorylate Ser/Thr residues in the \u03b2/\u03b3 interaction domain of the AMPK\u03b1 subunit that subsequently blocks the activation of AMPK. These inhibitory pathways include the insulin/AKT, cyclic AMP/PKA, and RAS/MEK/ERK pathways. We will examine the evidence whether the efficiency of AMPK responsiveness declines during the aging process. Next, we will review the mechanisms involved in curtailing the activation of AMPK. Finally, we will elucidate the potential age-related changes in the inhibitory regulation of AMPK signaling that might be a part of the aging process.",

Further, upon DNA-damage, DNA accumulates in the cytoplasm, thereby inducing the IFI16 protein and STING-dependent IFN-\u03b2 production and activation of the IFI16 inflammasome, resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18). Increased expression of IFI16 protein in a variety of cell-types promotes cellular senescence. However, reduced expression of IFI16 in cells promotes cell proliferation. Because expression of the IFI16 gene is induced by activation of DNA-damage response in cells and increased levels of IFI16 protein in cells potentiate the p53-mediated transcriptional activation of genes and p53 and pRb-mediated cell cycle arrest, we discuss how an improved understanding of the role of IFI16 protein in cellular senescence and associated inflammatory secretory phenotype is likely to identify the molecular mechanisms that contribute to the development of aging-associated human inflammatory diseases and a failure to cancer therapy.",

Potential therapeutic strategies directed to counteract these molecular changes are of great interest for the prevention of the neurodegenerative process. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein composed of a catalytic subunit (TERT) and a RNA subunit (TERC). It is known that the telomerase is involved in the maintenance of telomere length and is a highly expressed protein in embryonic stages and decreases in adult cells. In the last decade, a growing number of studies have shown that TERT has neuroprotective effects in cellular and animal models after a brain injury. Significantly, differences in TERT expression between controls and patients with major depressive disorder have been observed. More recently, TERT has been associated with the decrease in reactive oxygen species and DNA protection in mitochondria of neurons.

A global burden of disease 2010 study revealed that hip and knee osteoarthritis ranked the 11th highest in terms of years lived with disability. Wear and tear can greatly influence the quality of life during ageing. In particular, wear and tear of the articular cartilage have adverse effects on joints and result in osteoarthritis.The articular cartilage uses longevity of type II collagen as the foundation around which turnover of proteoglycans and the homeostatic activity of chondrocytes play central roles thereby maintaining the function of articular cartilage in the ageing. The longevity of type II collagen involves a complex interaction of the scaffolding needs of the cartilage and its biochemical, structural and mechanical characteristics. The covalent cross-linking of heterotypic polymers of collagens type II, type IX and type XI hold together cartilage, allowing it to withstand ageing stresses. Discerning the biological clues in the armamentarium for preserving cartilage appears to be collagen cross-linking. Therapeutic methods to crosslink in in-vivo are non-existent. However intra-articular injections of polyphenols in vivo stabilize the cartilage and make it resistant to degradation, opening a new therapeutic possibility for prevention and intervention of cartilage degradation in osteoarthritis of aging.",

Synapse loss has a devastating effect on cellular communication, leading to wide ranging effects such as network disruption within central neural systems and muscle wastage in the periphery. These devastating effects link synaptic pathology to a diverse range of neurological disorders, spanning Alzheimer\u2019s disease to multiple sclerosis. This review will highlight some of the current literature on synaptic integrity in animal models of disease and human post-mortem studies.

The molecular and metabolic asset of adipose tissue quickly and dynamically readapts in response to nutrient fluctuations. Once delivered into cells, nutrients are managed by mitochondria that represent a key bioenergetics node. A persistent nutrient overload generates mitochondrial exhaustion and uncontrolled reactive oxygen species (mtROS) production. In adipocytes, metabolic/molecular reorganization is triggered culminating in the acquirement of a hypertrophic and hypersecretory phenotype that accelerates aging. Conversely, dietary regimens such as caloric restriction or time-controlled fasting endorse mitochondrial functionality and mtROS-mediated signalling, thus promoting geroprotection. In this perspective view, we argued some important molecular and metabolic aspects related to adipocyte response to nutrient stress. Finally we delineated hypothetical routes by which molecularly and metabolically readapted adipose tissue promotes healthy aging.",

Current models predicting cognitive decline include neuropsychological and/or biological markers. Additional markers based on walking ability might improve accuracy and specificity of these models because motor and cognitive functions share neuroanatomical structures and psychological processes. We reviewed the relationship between walking ability at one point of (mid) life and cognitive decline at follow-up. A systematic literature search identified 20 longitudinal studies. The average follow-up time was 4.5 years. Gait speed quantified walking ability in most studies (n\u00a0=\u00a018). Additional gait measures (n\u00a0=\u00a04) were step frequency, variability and step-length. Despite methodological weaknesses, results revealed that gait slowing (0.68\u20131.1\u00a0m/sec) preceded cognitive decline and the presence of dementia syndromes (maximal odds and hazard ratios of 10.4 and 11.1, respectively). The results indicate that measures of walking ability could serve as additional markers to predict cognitive decline. However, gait speed alone might lack specificity. We recommend gait analysis, including dynamic gait parameters, in clinical evaluations of patients with suspected cognitive decline. Future studies should focus on examining the specificity and accuracy of various gait characteristics to predict future cognitive decline.",

Our review attempts to summarize and critically evaluate this literature. We performed a systematic search for studies assessing episodic memory in AD patients who were genotyped for APOE \u03b54 and identified fourteen papers. Although most of these papers reported significant relationships between APOE \u03b54 and episodic memory decline in AD, some papers did not confirm this relationship. Our review links this controversy to the conflicting literature about the effects of APOE \u03b54 on general cognitive functioning in AD. We identify several shortcoming and limitations of the research on the relationship between APOE \u03b54 and episodic memory in AD, such as small sample sizes, non-representative populations, lack of comparison of early-onset vs. late-onset disease, and lack of comparison among different genotypes that include APOE \u03b54 (i.e., zero, one, or two \u03b54 alleles). Another major shortcoming of the reviewed literature was the lack of comprehensive evaluation of episodic memory decline, since episodic memory was solely evaluated with regard to encoding and retrieval, omitting evaluation of core episodic features that decline in AD, such as context recall (e.g., how, where, and when an episodic event has occurred) and subjective experience of remembering (e.g., reliving, emotion and feeling during episodic recollection). Future research taking these limitations into consideration could illuminate the nature of the relationship between APOE \u03b54 and episodic memory decline in AD.",

PAS granules are present mainly in the hippocampus, although they have also been described in other brain areas such as piriform and entorhinal cortices, and have been observed in other mammals than mice, like rats and monkeys. PAS granules have been identified as a wide range of brain deposits related to numerous neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyloid deposits, neurofibrillary tangles, Lafora bodies, corpora amylacea and polyglucosan bodies, and these identifications have generated controversy and particular theories about them. We have recently reported the presence of a neo-epitope in mice hippocampal PAS granules and the existence of natural IgM auto-antibodies directed against the neo-epitope in the plasma of the animals. The significance of the neo-epitope and the autoantibodies is discussed in this review. Moreover, we observed that the IgM anti-neo-epitope is frequently present as a contaminant in numerous commercial antibodies and is responsible of a considerable amount of false positive immunostainings, which may produce misinterpretations in the identification of the granules. Now that this point has been clarified, this article reviews and reconsiders the nature and physiopathological significance of these degenerative granules. Moreover, we suggest that neo-epitopes may turn into a useful brain-ageing biomarker and that autoimmunity could become a new focus in the study of age-related degenerative processes.",

After having identified surprisingly few studies that investigated emotional memory in older adults from a neurobiological perspective, we found a significant interaction between noradrenergic activity and emotional memory enhancement in older adults. This pattern of data are explained both in terms of a top-down modulation of behavioral processes (e.g., changes in priority and individual goals) and in terms of greater activity of noradrenergic system during aging. Altogether, both behavioral and genetic variations studies (e.g., Alpha 2 B Adrenoceptor genotype) have shown that healthy older adults are able to circumvent or minimize the experience of negative emotions and stabilize or even enhance positive emotional experiences. Future studies are highly warranted to better clarify the relationship between noradrenaline and emotional memories in the aging brain.",

     "abstract": "Ageing is characterised by progressive deterioration of physiological systems and the loss of skeletal muscle mass is one of the most recognisable, leading to muscle weakness and mobility impairments. This review highlights interactions between the immune system and skeletal muscle stem cells (widely termed satellite cells or myoblasts) to influence satellite cell behaviour during muscle regeneration after injury, and outlines deficits associated with ageing. Resident neutrophils and macrophages in skeletal muscle become activated when muscle fibres are damaged via stimuli (e.g. contusions, strains, avulsions, hyperextensions, ruptures) and release high concentrations of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors into the microenvironment. These localised responses serve to attract additional immune cells which can reach in excess of 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 immune cell/mm3 of skeletal muscle in order to orchestrate the repair process. T-cells have a delayed response, reaching peak activation roughly 4 days after the initial damage. The cytokines and growth factors released by activated T-cells play a key role in muscle satellite cell proliferation and migration, although the precise mechanisms of these interactions remain unclear. T-cells in older people display limited ability to activate satellite cell proliferation and migration which is likely to contribute to insufficient muscle repair and, consequently, muscle wasting and weakness. If the factors released by T-cells to activate satellite cells can be identified, it may be possible to develop therapeutic agents to enhance muscle regeneration and reduce the impact of muscle wasting during ageing and disease.",

     "abstract": "The damage to cellular components by reactive oxygen species, termed oxidative stress, both increases with age and likely contributes to age-related diseases including Alzheimer\u2019s disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and cataract formation. In the setting of oxidative stress, hydroxyl radicals can oxidize the benzyl ring of the amino acid phenylalanine, which then produces the abnormal tyrosine isomers meta-tyrosine or ortho-tyrosine. While elevations in m-tyrosine and o-tyrosine concentrations have been used as a biological marker of oxidative stress, there is emerging evidence from bacterial, plant, and mammalian studies demonstrating that these isomers, particularly m-tyrosine, directly produce adverse effects to cells and tissues. These new findings suggest that the abnormal tyrosine isomers could in fact represent mediators of the effects of oxidative stress. Consequently the accumulation of m- and o-tyrosine may disrupt cellular homeostasis and contribute to disease pathogenesis, and as result, effective defenses against oxidative stress can encompass not only the elimination of reactive oxygen species but also the metabolism and ultimately the removal of the abnormal tyrosine isomers from the cellular amino acid pool. Future research in this area is needed to clarify the biologic mechanisms by which the tyrosine isomers damage cells and disrupt the function of tissues and organs and to identify the metabolic pathways involved in removing the accumulated isomers after exposure to oxidative stress.",

Skeletal muscle recovery is a highly coordinated process involving cross-talk between immune and muscle cells.

The age-related reduction in muscle repair efficiency contributes to the development of sarcopenia, one of the most important factors of disability in elderly people. Preserving muscle regeneration capacity may slow the development of this syndrome. In this context, nutrition has drawn much attention: studies have demonstrated that nutrients such as amino acids, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols and vitamin D can improve skeletal muscle regeneration by targeting key functions of immune cells, muscle cells or both. Here we review the process of skeletal muscle regeneration with a special focus on the cross-talk between immune and muscle cells. We address the effect of aging on immune and skeletal muscle cells involved in muscle regeneration.

Oxidative stress, considered a hallmark of aging, is also an important feature in pathologies that predispose to CVD development, like hypertension, diabetes and obesity. Approaches directed to prevent the occurrence of CVD during aging have been explored both in experimental models and in controlled clinical trials, in order to improve health span, reduce hospitalizations and increase life quality during elderly. In this review we discuss oxidative stress role as a main risk factor that relates CVD with aging. As well as interventions that aim to reduce oxidative stress by supplementing with exogenous antioxidants. In particular, strategies of improving the endogenous antioxidant defenses through activating the nuclear factor related-2 factor (Nrf2) pathway; one of the best studied molecules in cellular redox homeostasis and a master regulator of the antioxidant and phase II detoxification response.",

     "abstract": "Hypertension is a highly prevalent condition with numerous health risks, and the incidence of hypertension is greatest among older adults. Traditional discussions of hypertension have largely focused on the risks for cardiovascular disease and associated events. However, there are a number of collateral effects, including risks for dementia, physical disability, and falls/fractures which are increasingly garnering attention in the hypertension literature. Several key mechanisms \u2013 including inflammation, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction \u2013 are common to biologic aging and hypertension development and appear to have key mechanistic roles in the development of the cardiovascular and collateral risks of late-life hypertension. The objective of the present review is to highlight the multi-dimensional risks of hypertension among older adults and discuss potential strategies for treatment and future areas of research for improving overall care for older adults with hypertension.",

In this article, we discuss the importance of investigating disease mechanisms from cell culture, through different animal models of disease. We highlight that developing a viable, validated NHP AD model will likely be a key step toward understanding AD-relevant pathogenic mechanisms and for developing therapies that will effectively translate to the human disease condition.",

     "abstract": "The prevalence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is constantly growing worldwide in absence of any effective treatment. Methodology and technique advancements facilitated the early diagnosis of AD leading to a shift toward preclinical AD stages investigation in order to delay the disease onset in individuals at risk for AD. Recent evidence demonstrating the aging related multifactorial nature of AD supported the hypothesis that modifiable environmental factors can accelerate or delay the disease onset. In particular, healthy dietary habits, constant physical and cognitive activities are associated with reduced brain atrophy, amyloid load and incidence of AD cases. Due to these promising results, an emerging field of studies is currently investigating the efficacy of interventions addressing different lifestyle habits in cognitive intact elderly individuals as a potential preventive strategy against AD onset.We provide a critical overview of the current evidence on nonpharmacologic treatments in elderly individuals, discussing their efficacy on clinical and neuroimaging outcomes and identifying current methodological issues. Future perspectives, relevant for the scientific community and the worldwide public health institutes will be further discussed.",

     "abstract": "Non-pharmacological therapies, such as physical activity interventions, are an appealing alternative or add-on to current pharmacological treatment of cognitive symptoms in patients with dementia. In this meta-analysis, we investigated the effect of physical activity interventions on cognitive function in dementia patients, by synthesizing data from 802 patients included in 18 randomized control trials that applied a physical activity intervention with cognitive function as an outcome measure. Post-intervention standardized mean difference (SMD) scores were computed for each study, and combined into pooled effect sizes using random effects meta-analysis. The primary analysis yielded a positive overall effect of physical activity interventions on cognitive function (SMD[95% confidence interval]\u00a0=\u00a00.42[0.23;0.62], p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Secondary analyses revealed that physical activity interventions were equally beneficial in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.38[0.09;0.66], p\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and in patients with AD or a non-AD dementia diagnosis (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.47[0.14;0.80], p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Combined (i.e. aerobic and non-aerobic) exercise interventions (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.59[0.32;0.86], p\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and aerobic-only exercise interventions (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.41[0.05;0.76], p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) had a positive effect on cognition, while this association was absent for non-aerobic exercise interventions (SMD\u00a0=\u00a0-0.10[\u22120.38;0.19], p\u00a0=\u00a0.51). Finally, we found that interventions offered at both high frequency (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.33[0.03;0.63], p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) and at low frequency (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.64[0.39;0.89], p\u00a0<\u00a0.01) had a positive effect on cognitive function. This meta-analysis suggests that physical activity interventions positively influence cognitive function in patients with dementia. This beneficial effect was independent of the clinical diagnosis and the frequency of the intervention, and was driven by interventions that included aerobic exercise.",

Following these early observations numerous epidemiological studies have reported these associations. Since the prevalences of both visible aging signs and ischemic heart disease have a strong correlation with increasing age, it has been extensively debated whether the observed associations could be entirely explained by a common association with age. Furthermore, the etiologies of the visible aging signs are rarely fully understood, and pathophysiological explanations for these associations remain controversial, and are mostly speculative. As a consequence of inconsistent findings and lack of mechanistic explanations for the observed associations with ischemic heart disease, consensus on the clinical importance of these visible aging signs has been lacking.The aim of this review is for each of the visible aging signs to (i) review the etiology, (ii) to discuss the current epidemiological evidence for an association with risk of ischemic heart disease, and (iii) to present possible pathophysiological explanations for these associations. Finally this review discusses the potential clinical implications of these findings.",

Although the meta-analysis revealed robust support for enhancing both cognitive and motor performance, we outline a number of caveats on the use of tDCS.",

     "abstract": "Telomeres are the heterochromatic repeat regions at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, whose length is considered to be a determinant of biological ageing. Normal ageing itself is associated with telomere shortening. Here, critically short telomeres trigger senescence and eventually cell death. This shortening rate may be further increased by inflammation and oxidative stress and thus affect the ageing process. Apart from shortened or dysfunctional telomeres, cells undergoing senescence are also associated with hyperactivity of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB and overexpression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3 in circulating macrophages. Interestingly, telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that elongates telomeres, is involved in modulating NF-\u03baB activity. Furthermore, inflammation and oxidative stress are implicated as pre-disease mechanisms for chronic diseases of ageing such as neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. To date, inflammation and telomere shortening have mostly been studied individually in terms of ageing and the associated disease phenotype. However, the interdependent nature of the two demands a more synergistic approach in understanding the ageing process itself and for developing new therapeutic approaches. In this review, we aim to summarize the intricate association between the various inflammatory molecules and telomeres that together contribute to the ageing process and related diseases.",

The subsequent financial and societal burden placed on an already strained public health care system is of increasing concern.

Some of the most important findings, in relation to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) and the contemporary Western diet, and potential molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of these two diets on age-related cognitive function, are discussed in this review. A major aim of this review was to discuss whether or not a MedDiet intervention would be a feasible preventative approach against cognitive decline for older adults living in Western countries. Critical appraisal of the literature does somewhat support this idea. Demonstrated evidence highlights the MedDiet as a potential strategy to reduce cognitive decline in older age, and suggests the Western diet may play a role in the aetiology of cognitive decline. However, strong intrinsic Western socio-cultural values, traditions and norms may impede on the feasibility of this notion.",

     "publication date": "11-2015",
     "abstract": "The ABCC9 gene and its polypeptide product, SUR2, are increasingly implicated in human neurologic disease, including prevalent diseases of the aged brain. SUR2 proteins are a component of the ATP-sensitive potassium (\u201cKATP\u201d) channel, a metabolic sensor for stress and/or hypoxia that has been shown to change in aging. The KATP channel also helps regulate the neurovascular unit. Most brain cell types express SUR2, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, vascular smooth muscle, pericytes, and endothelial cells. Thus it is not surprising that ABCC9 gene variants are associated with risk for human brain diseases. For example, Cantu syndrome is a result of ABCC9 mutations; we discuss neurologic manifestations of this genetic syndrome. More common brain disorders linked to ABCC9 gene variants include hippocampal sclerosis of aging (HS-Aging), sleep disorders, and depression. HS-Aging is a prevalent neurological disease with pathologic features of both neurodegenerative (aberrant TDP-43) and cerebrovascular (arteriolosclerosis) disease. As to potential therapeutic intervention, the human pharmacopeia features both SUR2 agonists and antagonists, so ABCC9/SUR2 may provide a \u201cdruggable target\u201d, relevant perhaps to both HS-Aging and Alzheimer's disease. We conclude that more work is required to better understand the roles of ABCC9/SUR2 in the human brain during health and disease conditions.",

Such multifactorial effects of vitamin D3 can be a profitable source of new therapeutic solutions for two radically divergent diseases, cancer and neurodegeneration. Interestingly, an unusual association seems to exist between the occurrence of these two pathological states, called \u201cinverse comorbidity\u201d. Patients with cognitive dysfunctions or dementia have considerably lower risk of cancer, whereas survivors of cancer have lower prevalence of central nervous system (CNS) disorders.

Fasting or dietary restriction (DR) can help prevent these via anti-ageing effects; however, these effects in neurons are less well characterized. Here, a series of animal and human studies of the effects of DR on the structural and functional integrity of neurons and the underlying mechanisms are analyzed. DR improves the integrity of animal neurons via a wide range of possible mechanisms including changes in metabolism, oxidative damage, stress responses, growth factors, and gene expression. These mechanisms are extensively interlinked and point to an optimum range of calorie intake, above calorie deprivation and below burdensome calorie excess. Human studies also suggest that DR improves neuron integrity; however, due to ethical and methodological limitations, the most conclusive data on DR hinge upon on-going life-long monkey experiments. Rather than developing pharmacological mimetics of DR, our focus should be on educating the public about DR in order to minimize age-related disease.",

     "abstract": "The loss of muscle mass and strength with aging, referred to as sarcopenia, is a prevalent condition among the elderly. Although the molecular mechanisms underlying sarcopenia are unclear, evidence suggests that an age-related acceleration of myocyte loss via apoptosis might be responsible for muscle perfomance decline. Interestingly, sarcopenia has been associated to a deficit of sex hormones which decrease upon aging. The skeletal muscle ability to repair and regenerate itself would not be possible without satellite cells, a subpopulation of cells that remain quiescent throughout life. They are activated in response to stress, enabling them to guide skeletal muscle regeneration. Thus, these cells could be a key factor to overcome sarcopenia. Of importance, satellite cells are 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) targets. In this review, we summarize potential mechanisms through which these hormones regulate satellite cells activation during skeletal muscle regeneration in the elderly. The advance in its understanding will help to the development of potential therapeutic agents to alleviate and treat sarcopenia and other related myophaties.",

The female susceptibility for AD has been largely associated with the loss of ovarian sex hormones during menopause. This review examines the current understanding of the role of estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) in the regulation of neurological health and its implication in the development and intervention of AD. Since its discovery in 1996, research conducted over the last 15\u201320 years has documented a great deal of evidence indicating that ER\u03b2 plays a pivotal role in a broad spectrum of brain activities from development to aging. ER\u03b2 genetic polymorphisms have been associated with cognitive impairment and increased risk for AD predominantly in women. The role of ER\u03b2 in the intervention of AD has been demonstrated by the alteration of AD pathology in response to treatment with ER\u03b2-selective modulators in transgenic models that display pronounced plaque and tangle histopathological presentations as well as learning and memory deficits. Future studies that explore the potential interactions between ER\u03b2 signaling and the genetic isoforms of human apolipoprotein E (APOE) in brain aging and development of AD-risk phenotype are critically needed. The current trend of lost-in-translation in AD drug development that has primarily been based on early-onset familial AD (FAD) models underscores the urgent need for novel models that recapitulate the etiology of late-onset sporadic AD (SAD), the most common form of AD representing more than 95% of the current human AD population. Combining the use of FAD-related models that generally have excellent face validity with SAD-related models that hold more reliable construct validity would together increase the predictive validity of preclinical findings for successful translation into humans.",

As we age, maintenance of muscle homeostasis is perturbed, resulting in a loss of muscle mass and function, termed sarcopenia. Individuals with sarcopenia exhibit impaired balance, increased falls (leading to subsequent injury) and an overall decline in quality of life. The mechanisms mediating sarcopenia are still not fully understood but clarity in our understanding of the precise pathophysiological changes occurring during skeletal muscle ageing has improved dramatically. Advances in transcriptomics has highlighted significant deregulation in skeletal muscle gene expression with ageing, suggesting epigenetic alterations may play a crucial and potentially causative role in the skeletal muscle ageing process. microRNAs (miRNAs, miRs), novel regulators of gene expression, can modulate many processes in skeletal muscle, including myogenesis, tissue regeneration and cellular programming. Expression of numerous evolutionary conserved miRNAs is disrupted in skeletal muscle with age. Given that a single miRNA can simultaneously affect the functionality of multiple signaling pathways, miRNAs are potent modulators of pathophysiological changes. miRNA-based interventions provide a promising new therapeutic strategy against alterations in muscle homeostasis. The aim of this review is two-fold; firstly to outline the latest understanding of the pathophysiological alterations impacting the deregulation of skeletal muscle mass and function with ageing, and secondly, to highlight the mounting evidence for a role of miRNAs in modulating muscle mass, and the need to explore their specific role in sarcopenia.",

Ageing increases the risk of the onset of chronic inflammation-associated diseases such as cancer, diabetes, stroke, and neurodegenerative disease. In particular, ageing and cancer share some common origins and hallmarks such as genomic instability, epigenetic alteration, aberrant telomeres, inflammation and immune injury, reprogrammed metabolism, and degradation system impairment (including within the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system and the autophagic machinery). Recent advances indicate that damage-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) such as high mobility group box 1, histones, S100, and heat shock proteins play location-dependent roles inside and outside the cell. These provide interaction platforms at molecular levels linked to common hallmarks of ageing and cancer. They can act as inducers, sensors, and mediators of stress through individual plasma membrane receptors, intracellular recognition receptors (e.g., advanced glycosylation end product-specific receptors, AIM2-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors, and NOD1-like receptors, and toll-like receptors), or following endocytic uptake. Thus, the DAMP Hypothesis is novel and complements other theories that explain the features of ageing. DAMPs represent ideal biomarkers of ageing and provide an attractive target for interventions in ageing and age-associated diseases.",

These include reactive oxygen species (ROS) released from damaged mitochondria, extracellular nucleotides like ATP, high mobility group box (HMGB) 1 protein, oxidized low density lipoprotein, amyloid-beta (A\u03b2), islet amyloid polypeptide and particulates like monosodium urate (MSU) crystals and cholesterol crystals. Some of these DAMPs trigger the activation of inflammasomes, cytosolic danger sensing signalling platforms that drive both the maturation of specific pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1\u03b2, as well as the initiation of pro-inflammatory pyroptotic cell death. Herein, we review the evidence that dysregulated inflammasome activation, via altered innate immune cell functions and elevated levels of DAMPs, contributes to the establishment of chronic, low-grade inflammation (characterized by elevated levels of IL-6 and C-reactive protein) and the development of age-related pathological processes.",

In the present review, we highlight emerging evidence that supports the notion that extracellular DAMPs act as crucial proinflammatory danger signals.

     "abstract": "Diabetes, a group of metabolic and age-related diseases, is a major global health problem, the incidence of which has increased dramatically in recent decades. Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a complex, T cell-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by immune cell infiltration and chronic inflammation in the islets of Langerhans. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) resulting from insulin resistance and \u03b2-cell dysfunction. The involvement of inflammatory processes, such as immune cell infiltration, and chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of diabetes is less well understood in T2DM than in T1DM. However, studies conducted in the past decade have shown a strong link between inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. They have also shown that chronic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of both T1DM and T2DM. Two immunological factors commonly contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes: the activation of inflammasomes and the release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Inflammasomes are intracellular multiprotein molecular platforms. DAMPs act as endogenous danger signals. Here, we review current research on the function(s) of inflammasomes and DAMPs and discuss their pathological relevance and therapeutic implications in diabetes.",

DAMPs which are released from damaged cells following activation, injury or cell death can activate the immune response through the stimulation of the inflammasome through several types of receptors found on the plasma membrane, inside endosomes after endocytosis as well as in the cytosol.

     "abstract": "Human ageing is associated with a gradual decline in the physiological functions of the body at multiple levels and it is a key risk factor for many diseases, including cancer. Ageing process is intimately related to widespread cellular senescence, characterised by an irreversible loss of proliferative capacity and altered functioning associated with telomere attrition, accumulation of DNA damage and compromised mitochondrial and metabolic function. Tumour and senescent cells may be generated in response to the same stimuli, where either cellular senescence or transformation would constitute two opposite outcomes of the same degenerative process. This paper aims to review the state of knowledge on the biomolecular relationship between cellular senescence, ageing and cancer. Importantly, many of the cell signalling pathways that are found to be altered during both cellular senescence and tumourigenesis are regulated through shared epigenetic mechanisms and, therefore, they are potentially reversible. MicroRNAs are emerging as pivotal players linking ageing and cancer. These small RNA molecules have generated great interest from the point of view of future clinical therapy for cancer because successful experimental results have been obtained in animal models. Micro-RNA therapies for cancer are already being tested in clinical phase trials. These findings have potential importance in cancer treatment in aged people although further research-based knowledge is needed to convert them into an effective molecular therapies for cancer linked to ageing.",

There are also numerous reports of reduced CD in the aged brain and other studies showing reduced CD in the kidney and heart of aged animals. Thus a waning angiogenesis throughout the body may be a natural occurrence in later years and may account significantly for the lesser ailments (physical and cognitive) of elderly people. Old age is regarded here as a deficiency state which may be corrected by therapeutic angiogenesis, much as a hormonal deficiency can be relieved by the appropriate hormone therapy. Such therapy could employ recombinant angiogenic factors which are now commercially available.",

Does one cause the other, or does some third factor produce both? The answer has critical implications for prevention, rehabilitation, and health policy but has been difficult to establish for several reasons. First, determining a causal relationship in natural, correlational samples is problematic, and hearing and cognition are difficult to measure independently. Here, we critically review the evidence for a link between hearing loss and cognitive decline. We conclude that the evidence is convincing, but that the effects are small when hearing is measured audiometrically. We review four different directional hypotheses that have been offered as explanations for such a link, and conclude that no single hypothesis is sufficient. We introduce a framework that highlights that hearing and cognition rely on shared neurocognitive resources, and relate to each other in several different ways. We also discuss interventions for sensory and cognitive decline that may permit more causal inferences.",

Decline of this ability, as observed in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), results in an impaired sense of self and identity. In our model (AMAD: Autobiographical Memory in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease), we present a critical review of theories and findings regarding cognitive and neuroanatomical underpinnings of autobiographical memory and its decline in AD and highlight studies on its clinical rehabilitation. We propose that autobiographical recall in AD is mainly characterized by loss of associated episodic information, which leads to de-contextualization of autobiographical memories and a shift from reliving past events to a general sense of familiarity. This decline refers to retrograde, but also anterograde amnesia that affects newly acquired memories besides remote ones. One consequence of autobiographical memory decline in AD is decreased access to memories that shape self-consciousness, self-knowledge, and self-images, leading to a diminished sense of self and identity. The link between autobiographical decline and compromised sense of self in AD can also manifest itself as low correspondence and coherence between past memories and current goals and beliefs. By linking cognitive, neuroanatomical, and clinical aspects of autobiographical decline in AD, our review provides a theoretical foundation, which may lead to better rehabilitation strategies.",

Attention has recently shifted into trying to identify preventative measures that may delay the onset of the illness. Preventative factors include physical activity, proper diet, cognitive stimulation and the management of conditions such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity. However, it remains imperative to identify approaches that may help patients already diagnosed with the illness. Alongside pharmacological research, much work has been done on uncovering strategies which may slow down the progression of AD.

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a geriatric condition that comprises declined skeletal muscle mass, strength and function, leading to the risk of multiple adverse outcomes, including death. Its pathophysiology involves neuroendocrine and inflammatory factors, unfavorable nutritional habits and low physical activity.Sleep may play a role in muscle protein metabolism, although this hypothesis has not been studied extensively. Reductions in duration and quality of sleep and increases in prevalence of circadian rhythm and sleep disorders with age favor proteolysis, modify body composition and increase the risk of insulin resistance, all of which have been associated with sarcopenia.Data on the effects of age-related slow-wave sleep decline, circadian rhythm disruptions and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG), somatotropic axes, and glucose metabolism indicate that sleep disorder interventions may affect muscle loss. Recent research associating OSA with the risk of conditions closely related to the sarcopenia process, such as frailty and sleep quality impairment, indirectly suggest that sleep can influence skeletal muscle decline in the elderly.Several protein synthesis and degradation pathways are mediated by growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), testosterone, cortisol and insulin, which act on the cellular and molecular levels to increase or reestablish muscle fiber, strength and function. Age-related sleep problems potentially interfere intracellularly by inhibiting anabolic hormone cascades and enhancing catabolic pathways in the skeletal muscle.Specific physical exercises combined or not with nutritional recommendations are the current treatment options for sarcopenia. Clinical studies testing exogenous administration of anabolic hormones have not yielded adequate safety profiles. Therapeutic approaches targeting sleep disturbances to normalize circadian rhythms and sleep homeostasis may represent a novel strategy to preserve or recover muscle health in older adults. Promising research results regarding the associations between sleep variables and sarcopenia biomarkers and clinical parameters are required to confirm this hypothesis.",

Various conditions like tissue injury, stress responses, and regeneration challenge the stem cell pool to re-establish homeostasis (Fig. 1). However, with increasing age the functionality of adult stem cells declines and genomic mutations accumulate. These defects affect different cellular response pathways and lead to impairments in regeneration, stress tolerance, and organ function as well as to an increased risk for the development of ageing associated diseases and cancer. Maintenance of the genome appears to be of utmost importance to preserve stem cell function and to reduce the risk of ageing associated dysfunctions and pathologies.

In the mitochondrial matrix, protein quality control is mainly achieved by the Lon and Clp proteases which are also key players in damaged mitochondrial proteins degradation. Accumulation of damaged macromolecules resulting from oxidative stress and failure of protein maintenance constitutes a hallmark of cellular and organismal ageing and is believed to participate to the age-related decline of cellular function. Hence, age-related impairment of mitochondrial protein quality control may therefore contribute to the age-associated build-up of oxidized protein and alterations of mitochondrial redox and protein homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria to nucleus signaling has been the most extensively studied mode of inter-organelle communication. The first signaling pathway in this category of information transfer to be discovered was the retrograde response, with its own set of signal transduction proteins. The finding that this pathway compensates for mitochondrial dysfunction to extend the replicative lifespan of yeast cells has generated additional impetus for its study. This research has demonstrated crosstalk between the retrograde response and the target of rapamycin (TOR), small GTPase RAS, and high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathways in yeast, all of which are key players in replicative lifespan. More recently, the retrograde response has been implicated in the diauxic shift and survival in stationary phase, extending its operation to the yeast chronological lifespan as well. In this capacity, the retrograde response may cooperate with other, related mitochondria to nucleus signaling pathways. Counterparts of the retrograde response are found in the roundworm, the fruit fly, the mouse, and even in human cells in tissue culture. The exciting realization that the retrograde response is embedded in the network of cellular quality control processes has emerged over the past few years. Most strikingly, it is closely integrated with autophagy and the selective brand of this quality control process, mitophagy. This coordination depends on TOR, and it engages ceramide/sphingolipid signaling. The yeast LAG1 ceramide synthase gene was the first longevity gene cloned as such, and its orthologs hyl-1 and hyl-2 determine worm lifespan. Thus, the involvement of ceramide signaling in quality control gives these findings cellular context. The retrograde response and ceramide are essential components of a lifespan maintenance process that likely evolved as a cytoprotective mechanism to defend the organism from diverse stressors.",

Mis-regulation of PCD is increasingly implicated in aging and aging-related disease. During aging the cell turnover rate declines for several highly-mitotic tissues. Aging-associated disruptions in systemic and inter-cell signaling combined with cell-autonomous damage and mitochondrial malfunction result in increased PCD in some cell types, and decreased PCD in other cell types. Increased PCD during aging is implicated in immune system decline, skeletal muscle wasting (sarcopenia), loss of cells in the heart, and neurodegenerative disease. In contrast, cancer cells and senescent cells are resistant to PCD, enabling them to increase in abundance during aging. PCD pathways limit life span in fungi, but whether PCD pathways normally limit adult metazoan life span is not yet clear. PCD is regulated by a balance of negative and positive factors, including the mitochondria, which are particularly subject to aging-associated malfunction.",

     "abstract": "The vertebrate adaptive immune system is remarkable for its possession of a very broad range of antigen receptors imbuing the system with exquisite specificity, in addition to the phagocytic and inflammatory cells of the innate system shared with invertebrates. This system requires strict control both at the level of the generation the cells carrying these receptors and at the level of their activation and effector function mediation in order to avoid autoimmunity and mitigate immune pathology. Thus, quality control checkpoints are built into the system at multiple nodes in the response, relying on clonal selection and regulatory networks to maximize pathogen-directed effects and minimize collateral tissue damage. However, these checkpoints are compromised with age, resulting in poorer immune control manifesting as tissue-damaging autoimmune and inflammatory phenomena which can cause widespread systemic disease, paradoxically compounding the problems associated with increased susceptibility to infectious disease and possibly cancer in the elderly. Better understanding the reasons for slippage of immune control will pave the way for developing rational strategies for interventions to maintain appropriate immunity while reducing immunopathology.",

The aim of this paper is to review the impact of folate status on the risk of development of neuropsychiatric disorders in older individuals. The prevalence of folate deficiency is high among individuals aged \u226565 years mainly due to reduced dietary intake and intestinal malabsorption. Population-based studies have demonstrated that a low folate status is associated with mild cognitive impairment, dementia (particularly Alzheimer\u2019s disease) and depression in healthy and neuropsychiatric diseased older individuals. The proposed mechanisms underlying that association include hyperhomocysteinemia, lower methylation reactions and tetrahydrobiopterin levels, and excessive misincorporation of uracil into DNA. However, currently, there is no consistent evidence demonstrating that folic acid supplementation improves cognitive function or slows cognitive decline in healthy or cognitively impaired older individuals. In conclusion, folate deficiency seems to be an important contributor for the onset and progression of neuropsychiatric diseases in the geriatric population but additional studies are needed in order to increase the knowledge of this promising, but still largely unexplored, area of research.",

In view of increasing life expectancy, sarcopenia renders a heavy burden on the health care system. However, although there is a consensus that sarcopenia is a multifactorial syndrome, its etiology, underlying mechanisms, and even definition remain poorly delineated, thus, preventing development of a precise treatment strategy. The main aim of our review is to critically analyze potential sarcopenia biomarkers in light of the molecular mechanisms of their involvement in sarcopenia pathogenesis. Normal muscle mass and function maintenance are proposed to be dependent on the dynamic balance between the positive regulators of muscle growth such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), follistatin (FST) and irisin, and negative regulators including TGF\u03b2, myostatin, activins A and B, and growth and differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15). We hypothesize that the shift in this balance to muscle growth inhibitors, along with increased expression of the C- terminal agrin fragment (CAF) associated with age-dependent neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction, as well as skeletal muscle-specific troponin T (sTnT), a key component of contractile machinery, is a main mechanism underlying sarcopenia pathogenesis.

This review discusses the role of oxidative events of tissue degeneration and aging in general, and for the skin in particular. The mechanisms involved in intrinsic and extrinsic (photo-) aging are described. Since photoaging is recognized as an important extrinsic aging factor, we put special emphasize on the effects of UV exposure on aging, and its variable influence according to global location and skin type. We here summarise direct photochemical effects of UV on DNA, RNA, proteins and vitamin D, the factors contributing to UV-induced immunosuppression, which may delay aging, the nature and origin of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) as indirect contributors for aging, and the consequences of oxidative events for extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, such as that of collagen. We conclude that conflicting data on studies investigating the validity of the free radical damage theory of aging may reflect variations in the level of ROS induction which is difficult to quantify in vivo, and the lack of targeting of experimental ROS to the relevant cellular compartment. Also mitohormesis, an adaptive response, may arise in vivo to moderate ROS levels, further complicating interpretation of in vivo results. We here describes how skin aging is mediated both directly and indirectly by oxidative degeneration.This review indicates that skin aging events are initiated and often propagated by oxidation events, despite recently recognized adaptive responses to oxidative stress.",

Starting with the question Why do we age as individual organisms, but the line of pluripotent embryonic stem cells and germ cells carried by individuals and transmitted to descendants is immortal? this review discusses how the process of cellular differentiation leads to the accumulation of biological imperfections with ageing, and how these imperfections may be the cause of chronic inflammatory responses to stress that undermine cellular function. Both differentiation and inflammation involve drastic metabolic changes associated with alterations in mitochondrial dynamics that shift the balance between aerobic glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. With ageing, mitochondrial dysfunction can be both the cause and consequence of inflammatory processes and elicit metabolic adaptations that might be either protective or become progressively detrimental. It is argued here that an understanding of the relationship between metabolism, differentiation and inflammation is essential to understand the pathological mechanisms governing brain health and disease during ageing.",

Drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) is required in order to reach diseases causes and treat them. However, biological barriers, mainly blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), are the key obstacles that prevent the effectiveness of possible treatments due to their ability to strongly limit the perfusion of compounds into the brain. Over the past decades, new approaches towards overcoming BBB and its efflux transporters had been proposed. One of these approaches here reviewed is through small interfering RNA (siRNA), which is capable to specifically target one gene and silence it in a post-transcriptional way. There are different possible functional proteins at the BBB, as the ones responsible for transport or just for its tightness, which could be a siRNA target. As important as the effective silence is the way to delivery siRNA to its anatomical site of action. This is where nanotechnology-based systems may help, by protecting siRNA circulation and providing cell/tissue-targeting and intracellular siRNA delivery. After an initial overview on incidence of brain diseases and basic features of the CNS, BBB and its efflux pumps, this review focuses on recent strategies to reach brain based on siRNA, and how to specifically target these approaches in order to treat brain diseases.",

In the past decades, the idea of a bone\u2013muscle unit has emerged. Numerous studies have confirmed this hypothesis from in utero to aging works. Space flight, bed rest as well as osteoporosis and sarcopenia experimentations have allowed to accumulate considerable evidence. Mechanical loading is a key mechanism linking both tissues with a central promoting role of physical activity. Moreover, the skeletal muscle secretome accounts various molecules that affect bone including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-15, myostatin, osteoglycin (OGN), FAM5C, Tmem119 and osteoactivin. Even though studies on the potential effects of bone on muscle metabolism are sparse, few osteokines have been identified. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and Wnt3a, which are secreted by osteocytes, osteocalcin (OCN) and IGF-1, which are produced by osteoblasts and sclerostin which is secreted by both cell types, might impact skeletal muscle cells. Cartilage and adipose tissue are also likely to participate to this control loop and should not be set aside. Indeed, chondrocytes are known to secrete Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and adipocytes produce leptin, adiponectin and IL-6, which potentially modulate bone and muscle metabolisms. The understanding of this system will enable to define new levers to prevent/treat sarcopenia and osteoporosis at the same time.

Potentially reversible cognitive impairment is MCI (CDR\u00a0=\u00a00.5).

     "abstract": "The equine aging process involves many changes to the immune system that may be related to genetics, the level of nutrition, the environment and/or an underlying subclinical disease. Geriatric horses defined as horses above the age of 20, exhibit a decline in body condition, muscle tone and general well-being. It is not known whether these changes contribute to decreased immune function or are the result of declining immune function. Geriatric years are characterized by increased susceptibility to infections and a reduced antibody response to vaccination as a result of changes in the immune system. Humans and horses share many of these age-related changes, with only a few differences. Thus, inflamm-aging and immunosenescence are well-described phenomena in both human and equine research, particularly in relation to the peripheral blood and especially the T-cell compartment. However, the lung is faced with unique challenges because of its constant interaction with the external environment and thus may not share similarities to peripheral blood when considering age-related changes in immune function. Indeed, recent studies have shown discrepancies in cytokine mRNA and protein expression between the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage immune cells. These results provide important evidence that age-related immune changes or \u2018dys-functions\u2019 are organ-specific.",

The objective of this systematic review is to provide a critical evaluation of available evidence and to explore the role of gaze behavior among older adults during different forms of locomotion. Database searches were conducted to identify research papers that met the inclusion criteria of (1) study variables that included direct measurement of gaze and at least one form of locomotion, (2) participants who were older adults aged 60 years and above, and (3) reporting original research. Twenty-five papers related to walking on a straight path and turning (n\u00a0=\u00a04), stair navigation (n\u00a0=\u00a03), target negotiation and obstacle circumvention (n\u00a0=\u00a013) and perturbation-evoked sudden loss of balance (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were identified for the final quality assessment. The reviewed articles were found to have acceptable quality, with scores ranging from 47.06% to 94.12%. Overall, the current literature suggests that differences in gaze behavior during locomotion appear to change in late adulthood, especially with respect to transfer of gaze to and from a target, saccade-step latency, fixation durations on targets and viewing patterns. These changes appear to be particularly pronounced for older adults with high risk of falling and impaired executive functioning.",

Three such factors are the challenges of physical exercise, food deprivation/fasting, and social/intellectual engagement. Because it evolved, in part, for success in seeking and acquiring food, the brain functions best when the individual is hungry and physically active, as typified by the hungry lion stalking and chasing its prey. Indeed, studies of animal models and human subjects demonstrate robust beneficial effects of regular exercise and intermittent energy restriction/fasting on cognitive function and mood, particularly in the contexts of aging and associated neurodegenerative disorders. Unfortunately, the agricultural revolution and the invention of effort-sparing technologies have resulted in a dramatic reduction or elimination of vigorous exercise and fasting, leaving only intellectual challenges to bolster brain function. In addition to disengaging beneficial adaptive responses in the brain, sedentary overindulgent lifestyles promote obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, all of which may increase the risk of cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. It is therefore important to embrace the reality of the requirements for exercise, intermittent fasting and critical thinking for optimal brain health throughout life, and to recognize the dire consequences for our aging population of failing to implement such brain-healthy lifestyles.",

     "abstract": "Strong consensus exists regarding the most robust environmental intervention for attenuating aging processes and increasing healthspan and lifespan: calorie restriction (CR). Over several decades, this paradigm has been replicated in numerous nonhuman models, and has been expanded over the last decade to formal, controlled human studies of CR. Given that long-term CR can create heavy challenges to compliance in human diets, the concept of a calorie restriction mimetic (CRM) has emerged as an active research area within gerontology. In past presentations on this subject, we have proposed that a CRM is a compound that mimics metabolic, hormonal, and physiological effects of CR, activates stress response pathways observed in CR and enhances stress protection, produces CR-like effects on longevity, reduces age-related disease, and maintains more youthful function, all without significantly reducing food intake, at least initially. Over 16 years ago, we proposed that glycolytic inhibition could be an effective strategy for developing CRM. The main argument here is that inhibiting energy utilization as far upstream as possible provides the highest chance of generating a broad spectrum of CR-like effects when compared to targeting a singular molecular target downstream. As an initial candidate CRM, 2-deoxyglucose, a known anti-glycolytic, was shown to produce a remarkable phenotype of CR, but further investigation found that this compound produced cardiotoxicity in rats at the doses we had been using. There remains interest in 2DG as a CRM but at lower doses. Beyond the proposal of 2DG as a candidate CRM, the field has grown steadily with many investigators proposing other strategies, including novel anti-glycolytics. Within the realm of upstream targeting at the level of the digestive system, research has included bariatric surgery, inhibitors of fat digestion/absorption, and inhibitors of carbohydrate digestion. Research focused on downstream sites has included insulin receptors, IGF-1 receptors, sirtuin activators, inhibitors of mTOR, and polyamines. In the current review we discuss progress made involving these various strategies and comment on the status and future for each within this exciting research field.",

In this review, we present an overview of our current understanding of orexin function, focusing on sleep disorders, energy balance, and aging, in both rodents and humans. We first discuss animal models used in studies of obesity and sleep, including loss of function using transgenic or viral-mediated approaches, gain of function models using exogenous delivery of orexin receptor agonist, and naturally-occurring models in which orexin responsiveness varies by individual. We next explore rodent models of orexin in aging, presenting evidence that orexin loss contributes to age-related changes in sleep and energy balance. In the next section, we focus on clinical importance of orexin in human obesity, sleep, and aging. We include discussion of orexin loss in narcolepsy and potential importance of orexin in insomnia, correlations between animal and human studies of age-related decline, and evidence for orexin involvement in age-related changes in cognitive performance. Finally, we present a summary of recent studies of orexin in neurodegenerative disease. We conclude that orexin acts as an integrative homeostatic signal influencing numerous brain regions, and that this pivotal role results in potential dysregulation of multiple physiological processes when orexin signaling is disrupted or lost.",

Across all ages, higher adiposity was consistently associated with frontal GM atrophy, particularly in prefrontal cortex. In children and adults <40 years of age, most studies found no relationship between adiposity and occipital or parietal GM volumes, whereas findings for temporal lobe were mixed. In middle-aged and aged adults, a majority of studies found that higher adiposity is associated with parietal and temporal GM atrophy, whereas results for precuneus, posterior cingulate, and hippocampus were mixed. Higher adiposity had no clear association with global or regional WM in any age group.

Recent studies not only confirm the association of APOE with longevity in different populations, but also implicate several other pathways that may influence longevity including nitric oxide production, inflammation, immunity, and DNA damage response and repair. Recent evidence also suggests that mitochondrial DNA may play an important role in attaining longevity. Despite these implicated pathways, longevity may be a polygenic trait influenced by a complex interplay of multiple genes. Future genetic studies on aging would benefit from larger samples of long-lived individuals, birth-cohort matched controls, inclusion of different aging phenotypes (e.g., aging free of morbidities), and analysis of gender differences.",

Recently, adult skin-resident stem/progenitor cells, growth arrest, senescence or apoptotic death and dysfunction caused by alterations in key signaling genes, such as Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt-kinases, Wnt, p21 and p53, have been shown to play a vital role in skin regeneration. Simultaneously, enhanced telomere attrition, hormone exhaustion, oxidative stress, genetic events and ultraviolet radiation exposure that result in severe DNA damage, genomic instability and epigenetic mutations also contribute to skin aging.

Age-associated declines in semen volume, percentage motility, progressive motility, normal morphology and unfragmented cells were statistically significant and results generally seemed to be robust against confounding factors. Unexpectedly, sperm concentration did not decline with increasing male age, even though we found that sperm concentration declined over time. Our findings indicate that male age needs more recognition as a potential contributor to the negative pregnancy outcomes and reduced offspring health associated with delayed first reproduction.

In particular, specific youthful rejuvenating circulatory factors reverse age-related declines in stem cell function, whereas the old milieu contains inhibitory factors that impede stem cell function in young animals. Similarly, the effects of certain dietary interventions, namely calorie restriction, also induce a more youthful cellular and molecular phenotype in ageing stem cells throughout the body. Further to this, there are key molecular pathways involved in translating the availability of nutrients into altered stem cell function, including signalling in the insulin and insulin-like growth factor and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathways.

Three systems control the quality of proteins: chaperone-mediated refolding, proteasomal degradation of ubiquitinated proteins, and finally, when the two others fail, aggrephagy, as selective form of autophagy, degrades ubiquitin-labelled aggregated cargos. In this route misfolded proteins gradually form larger aggregates, aggresomes and they eventually become double membrane-wrapped organelles called autophagosomes, which become degraded when they fuse to lysosomes, for reuse by the cell. The stages, the main molecules participating in the process, and the regulation of aggrephagy are discussed here, as is the role of protein aggregation in protein accumulation diseases. In particular, we emphasize that both Alzheimer's disease and age-related macular degeneration, two of the most common pathologies in the aged, are characterized by altered protein clearance and deposits.

However, accumulating evidence indicates that A\u03b2 may activate astrocytes, which leads to an increase in cytokines that has been suggested to be a causative factor in the cognitive dysfunction of AD; thus, a vicious circle may be created. Intrinsic inflammatory mechanisms may provide a regulatory system that is capable of influencing the neuronal microenvironment that affects neuronal survival. In this article, we address the evidence surrounding the interactions of dysfunctional astrocytes with neighboring neurons that may initiate a cascade of events that culminates with neuronal injury and the expression of the hallmark lesions of AD.

Thus, controlling risk factors will contribute to reducing their incidence, leading to healthy lifespan. CVDs are complex diseases influenced by numerous genetic and environmental factors. Numerous gene variants that are associated with a greater or lesser risk of the different types of CVD and of intermediate phenotypes (i.e., hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, diabetes) have been successfully identified. However, despite the close link between aging and CVD, studies analyzing the genes related to human longevity have not obtained consistent results and there has been little coincidence in the genes identified in both fields.

However, on a molecular level, ageing is a complex multi-mechanistic process whose contributing factors may vary individually, partly overlap with pathological alterations, and are often poorly understood. Proteome analysis potentially allows modelling of these multifactorial processes. This review summarises recent proteomic research on age-related changes identified in animal models and human studies. We combined this information with pathway analysis to identify molecular mechanisms associated with ageing. We identified some molecular pathways that are affected in most or even all organs and others that are organ-specific. However, appropriately powered studies are needed to confirm these findings based in in silico evaluation.",

However, contradictory data about PSD-95 expression in aging and AD have been reported. Indeed in AD versus control brains PSD-95 varies according to regions, increasing in the frontal cortex, at least in a primary stage, and decreasing in the temporal cortex. In contrast, in transgenic mouse models of aging and AD PSD-95 expression is decreased, in behaviorally aged impaired versus unimpaired rodents it can decrease or increase and finally, it is increased in rodents grown in enriched environments. Different factors explain these contradictory results in both animals and humans, among others concomitant psychiatric endophenotypes, such as depression. The possible involvement of PSD-95 in reactive and/or compensatory mechanisms during AD progression is underscored, at least before the occurrence of important synaptic elimination. Thus, in AD but not in AD transgenic mice, enhanced expression might precede the diminution commonly observed in advanced aging. A two-compartments cell model, separating events taking place in cell bodies and synapses, is presented. Overall these data suggest that AD research will progress by untangling pathological from protective events, a prerequisite for effective therapeutic strategies.",

Chronological age is a commonly used developmental index; however, it offers little insight into the mechanisms underlying cognitive decline. In contrast, biological age (BioAge), reflecting the vitality of essential biological systems, represents a promising operationalization of developmental time. Current BioAge models have successfully predicted age-related cognitive deficits. Research on aging-related cognitive function indicates that the interaction of multiple risk and protective factors across the human lifespan confers individual risk for late-life cognitive decline, implicating a multi-causal explanation. In this review, we explore current BioAge models, describe three broad yet pathologically relevant biological processes linked to cognitive decline, and propose a novel operationalization of BioAge accounting for both moderating and causal mechanisms of cognitive decline and dementia. We argue that a multivariate and mechanistic BioAge approach will lead to a greater understanding of disease pathology as well as more accurate prediction and early identification of late-life cognitive decline.",

Observational studies that examined determinants of protein\u2013energy malnutrition were selected and a best evidence synthesis was performed to summarize the results.In total 28 studies were included in this review from which 122 unique potential determinants were derived. Thirty-seven determinants were examined in sufficient number of studies and were included in a best evidence synthesis. The best evidence score comprised design (cross-sectional, longitudinal) and quality of the study (high, moderate) to grade the evidence level. Strong evidence for an association with protein\u2013energy malnutrition was found for poor appetite, and moderate evidence for edentulousness, having no diabetes, hospitalization and poor self-reported health. Strong evidence for no association was found for anxiety, chewing difficulty, few friends, living alone, feeling lonely, death of spouse, high number of diseases, heart failure and coronary failure, stroke (CVA) and the use of anti-inflammatory medications.This review shows that protein\u2013energy malnutrition is a multifactorial problem and that different domains likely play a role in the pathway of developing protein\u2013energy malnutrition.

These oxidized lipids result either from spontaneous and/or enzymatic oxidation of cholesterol on the steroid nucleus or on the side chain. The ability of oxysterols to induce severe dysfunctions in organelles (especially mitochondria) plays key roles in RedOx homeostasis, inflammatory status, lipid metabolism, and in the control of cell death induction, which may at least in part contribute to explain the potential participation of these molecules in ageing processes and in age related diseases. As no efficient treatments are currently available for most of these diseases, which are predicted to become more prevalent due to the increasing life expectancy and average age, a better knowledge of the biological activities of the different oxysterols is of interest, and constitutes an important step toward identification of pharmacological targets for the development of new therapeutic strategies.",

The accumulation of senescent cells over time probably reduces tissue regenerative capacity and contributes to the physiological ageing of the tissue itself. The mechanisms that govern ageing remain unclear and are under intense investigation, and insight could be gained by studying the mechanisms involved in cellular senescence. In vitro, keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts undergo senescence in response to multiple cellular stresses, including the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and the shortening of telomeres, or simply by reaching the end of their replicative potential (i.e., reaching replicative senescence). Recent findings demonstrate that microRNAs play key roles in regulating the balance between a cell's proliferative capacity and replicative senescence.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in skeletal muscle and are associated with aging. Accumulating evidence suggests that miRNAs play an important role in the age-related changes in skeletal muscle mass, composition and function. At the cellular level, miRNAs have been demonstrated to regulate muscle cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, miRNAs are involved in the transitioning of muscle stem cells from a quiescent, to either an activated or senescence state. Evidence from animal and human studies has shown miRNAs are modulated in muscle atrophy and hypertrophy. In addition, miRNAs have been implicated in changes in muscle fiber composition, fat infiltration and insulin resistance. Both exercise and dietary interventions can combat age-related changes in muscle mass, composition and function, which may be mediated by miRNA modulation in skeletal muscle. Circulating miRNA species derived from myogenic cell populations represent potential biomarkers of aging muscle and the molecular responses to exercise or diet interventions, but larger validation studies are required. In future therapeutic approaches targeting miRNAs, either through exercise, diet or drugs may be able to slow down or prevent the age-related changes in skeletal muscle mass, composition, function, hence help maintain mobility and quality of life in old age.",

The most abundant types of circulating sncRNAs are microRNAs (miRNAs), 5\u2032 transfer RNA (tRNA) halves, and YRNA fragments, with minute amounts of other types that may nevertheless be significant. Of the more abundant circulating sncRNAs only miRNAs have well described functions, but characteristics of the others suggest specific processing and secretion as complexes that protect the RNA from degradation. The properties of circulating sncRNAs are consistent with their serving as signaling molecules, and investigations of circulating miRNAs support the view that they can enter cells and regulate cellular functions. The serum levels of specific sncRNAs change markedly with age, and these changes can be mitigated by calorie restriction (CR), indicating that levels are under physiologic control. The ability of circulating sncRNAs to transmit functions between cells and to regulate a broad spectrum of cellular functions, and the changes in their levels with age, implicate them in the manifestations of aging.

A growing evidence indicates that epigenetics plays an important role in the regulation of healthspan but also is involved in the aging process. 2-Oxoglutarate (\u03b1-ketoglutarate) is a key metabolite in the Krebs cycle but it is also an obligatory substrate for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-OGDO). The 2-OGDO enzyme family includes the major enzymes of DNA and histone demethylation, i.e. Ten-Eleven Translocation (TETs) and Jumonji C domain containing (JmjC) demethylases. In addition, 2-OGDO members can regulate collagen synthesis and hypoxic responses in a non-epigenetical manner. Interestingly, succinate and fumarate, also Krebs cycle intermediates, are potent inhibitors of 2-OGDO enzymes, i.e. the balance of Krebs cycle reactions can affect the level of DNA and histone methylation and thus control gene expression.

We survey aging and longevity in all of the basal metazoan groups including ctenophores (comb jellies), sponges, placozoans, cnidarians (hydras, jellyfish, corals and sea anemones) and myxozoans. Then we move to the simplest bilaterian animals (with a head, three body cell layers, and bilateral symmetry), the two phyla of flatworms. A key determinant of longevity and immortality in most of these simple animals is the large numbers of pluripotent stem cells that underlie the remarkable abilities of these animals to regenerate and rejuvenate themselves. Finally, we discuss briefly the evolution of the higher bilaterians and how longevity was reduced and immortality lost due to attainment of greater body complexity and cell cycle strategies that protect these complex organisms from developing tumors. We also briefly consider how the evolution of multiple aging-related mechanisms/pathways hinders our ability to understand and modify the aging process in higher organisms.",

The meta-analytic findings indicate single and dual task tests of gait speed are equivalent in the prediction of falls in older people and sub-group analyses revealed similar findings for studies that included only cognitively impaired participants, slow walkers or used secondary mental-tracking or verbal fluency tasks.",

Multidomain interventions may alleviate symptoms and alter the disease course in a synergistic manner. This systematic review examines the effect of adding nutritional supplementation to cholinesterase inhibitors. A systematic PubMed and Cochrane search resulted in nine high quality studies. The studies had low to moderate risk of bias and focused on oxidative stress, homocysteine levels, membrane fluidity, inflammation and acetylcholine levels. Only the use of vitamin E supplements could reduce the rate of functional decline when combined with cholinesterase inhibitors in one study, whereas cognition was not affected in both this and other studies. None of the other nutritional supplements showed convincing evidence of a beneficial effect when combined with cholinesterase inhibitors. This shows that cognitive and functional improvement is difficult to achieve in patients with AD, despite epidemiological data and evidence of biological effects of nutritional supplements. Addressing one disease pathway in addition to cholinesterase inhibitor therapy is probably insufficient to alter the course of the disease. Personalized, multifactorial interventions may be more successful in improving cognition and daily functioning.",

Along with this increase the number of age related diseases, such as cardiovascular, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic impairment and cancer, is also on the rise thereby negatively impacting the burden on health care systems. Telomere shortening and dysfunction results in cellular senescence, an irreversible proliferative arrest that has been suggested to promote organismal aging and disabling age-related diseases. Given that telomerase, the enzyme responsible for maintaining telomere lengths, is not expressed at levels sufficient to prevent telomere shortening in most of our cells, telomeres progressively erode with advancing age. Telomerase activation, therefore, might serve as a viable therapeutic strategy to delay the onset of cellular senescence, tissue dysfunction and organismal decline. Here we analyze the more recent findings in telomerase activation as a potential key modulator for human healthspan and longevity.",

Although the pathophysiologic mechanism is not fully understood, inflammation has been shown to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. Inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by the activation of glial cells and release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that inflammasomes, which cleave precursors of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18 to generate their active forms, play an important role in the inflammatory response in the CNS and in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, modulating inflammasome complex assembly and activation could be a potential strategy for suppressing inflammation in the CNS. This review aims to provide insight into the role of inflammasomes in the CNS, with respect to the pathogenesis of AD, and may provide possible clues for devising novel therapeutic strategies.",

Two longitudinal studies examining the relationship between arterial stiffness and white matter hyperintensities found increased pulse wave velocity to be an independent predictor of white matter hyperintensity volume. Fifteen cross-sectional and seven longitudinal studies examining arterial stiffness and cognition were identified. Fourteen of the fifteen cross-sectional studies associated increased arterial stiffness with lower cognitive function, and six of the seven longitudinal studies found arterial stiffness to be predictive of cognitive decline.Arterial stiffness is associated with cerebral small vessel disease and decreased cognitive function.

Thirty-one randomised controlled trials were included, with 1806 participants in cognitive training groups and 386 in general mental stimulation groups. Meta-analysis results revealed that compared to active controls, cognitive training improved performance on measures of executive function (working memory, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04; processing speed, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and composite measures of cognitive function (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

The impact of cognitive training on everyday functioning is largely under investigated. More research is required to determine if general mental stimulation can benefit cognitive and everyday functioning. Transfer and maintenance of intervention effects are most commonly reported when training is adaptive, with at least ten intervention sessions and a long-term follow-up. Memory and subjective cognitive performance might be improved by training in group versus individual settings.",

However, increasing evidence suggests that a network level understanding of the brain can provide additional novel insight into the structural and functional organization from which complex behavior and dysfunction emerge. Using graph theory as a mathematical framework to characterize neural networks, recent data suggest that alterations in structural and functional networks may contribute to individual differences in cognitive phenotypes in advanced aging. This paper reviews literature that defines network changes in healthy and pathological aging phenotypes, while highlighting the substantial overlap in key features and patterns observed across aging phenotypes. Consistent with current efforts in this area, here we outline one analytic strategy that attempts to quantify graph theory metrics more precisely, with the goal of improving diagnostic sensitivity and predictive accuracy for differential trajectories in neurocognitive aging. Ultimately, such an approach may yield useful measures for gauging the efficacy of potential preventative interventions and disease modifying treatments early in the course of aging.",

Next, we consolidate osteopenic obesity with the already existing and more familiar term, sarcopenic obesity, and delineate the resulting combined condition assigning it the term osteosarcopenic obesity. Identification and possible diagnosis of each condition are discussed, as well as the interactions of muscle, fat and bone tissues on cellular level, considering their endocrine features. Special emphasis is placed on the mesenchymal stem cell commitment into osteoblastogenic, adipogenic and myogenic lineages and causes of its deregulation.

The purpose of this systematic review is to examine the efficacy of combined cognitive and exercise training in older adults with or without cognitive impairment and evaluate the methodological quality of the intervention studies. A systematic search of Cinahl, Medline, PsycINFO, ProQuest, EMBASE databases and the Cochrane Library was conducted. Manual searches of the reference list from the included papers and additional internet searches were also done. Eight studies were identified in this review, five of which included a cognitively impaired population and three studies included a cognitively healthy population. The results showed that combined cognitive and exercise training can be effective for improving the cognitive functions and functional status of older adults with and without cognitive impairment. However, limited evidence can be found in populations with cognitive impairment when the evaluation included an active control group comparison. Further well-designed studies are still needed to explore the potential benefits of this new intervention paradigm.",

Paradoxically, it is also related to reduced report of dyspnea, that is, the experience of difficult and uncomfortable breathing. Reduced symptom reporting contributes to misdiagnosis or late diagnosis of underlying disease, suboptimal treatment, faster disease progression, shorter life expectancy, lower quality of life for patients, and considerably increased costs for the health care system in an aging society. However, pathways in the complex relationship between dyspnea and age are not well explored yet.We propose a model on geriatric dyspnea that integrates physiological, neurological, psychological and social pathways which link older age with dyspnea perception and expression. We suggest that the seemingly paradox of reduction of dyspnea in older age, despite physiological decline, can be solved by taking age-related changes on these multiple levels into account. In identifying these variables, the Geriatric Dyspnea Model highlights risk factors for reduced dyspnea perception and report in older age and pathways for intervention.",

This study reviews active ingredients capable of counteracting symptoms of epidermal aging, organized according to the regulation of specific age-affected epidermal functions: (1) several compounds, other than retinoids and derivatives, act on the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes, supporting the protective barrier against mechanical and chemical insults; (2) natural lipidic compounds, as well as glycerol and urea, are described as agents for maintaining water-ion balance; (3) regulation of immunological pathogen defense can be reinforced by natural extracts and compounds, such as resveratrol; and (4) antioxidant exogenous sources enriched with flavonoids and vitamin C, for example, improve solar radiation protection and epidermal antioxidant activity.

The \u201cangiogenic paradox\u201d has been described in diabetes because this disease impairs the angiogenic response in a manner that differs depending on the organs involved and disease evolution. Aging is also associated with pro- and antiangiogenic processes. Glycation, the post-translational modification of proteins, increases with aging and the progression of diabetes. The effect of glycation on angiogenesis depends on the type of glycated proteins and cells involved. This complex link could be responsible for the \u201cangiogenic paradox\u201d in aging and age-related disorders and diseases. Using diabetes as a model, the present work has attempted to review the age-related angiogenic paradox, in particular the effects of glycation on angiogenesis during aging.",

In this review we focus specifically on the neuronal population associated with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, and try to understand how ageing puts these neurons at risk to the extent that a slight change in protein metabolism or mitochondrial function can push the cells over the edge leading to catastrophic cell death and many of the symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease. We review the evidence that ageing is important for the development of Parkinson's disease and how age related decline leads to the loss of neurons within this disease, before describing exactly how advancing age may lead to substantia nigra neuronal loss and Parkinson's disease in some individuals.",

Rodents models have often been used to enhance our understanding of mechanisms of age-related changes in human skeletal muscle. However, to what extent age-related alterations in determinants of muscle force generating capacity observed in rodents resemble those in humans has not been considered thoroughly. This review compares the effect of aging on muscle force generating determinants (muscle mass, fiber size, fiber number, fiber type distribution and muscle specific tension), in men and male rodents at similar relative age. It appears that muscle aging in male F344*BN rat resembles that in men most; 32\u201335-month-old rats exhibit similar signs of muscle weakness to those of 70\u201380-yr-old men, and the decline in 36\u201338-month-old rats is similar to that in men aged over 80\u00a0yrs. For male C57BL/6 mice, age-related decline in muscle force generating capacity seems to occur only at higher relative age than in men. We conclude that the effects on determinants of muscle force differ between species as well as within species, but qualitatively show the same pattern as that observed in men.",

     "abstract": "Aging is a complex biological phenomenon in which the deficiency of the nutritional state combined with the presence of chronic inflammation and oxidative stress contribute to the development of many age-related diseases. Under this profile, the free radicals produced by the oxidative stress lead to a damage of DNA, lipids and proteins with subsequent altered cellular homeostasis and integrity. In young-adult age, the cell has a complex efficient system to maintain a proper balance between the levels of free radicals and antioxidants ensuring the integrity of cellular components. In contrast, in old age this balance is poorly efficient compromising cellular homeostasis. Supplementation with Vitamin E can restore the balance and protect against the deteriorating effects of oxidative stress, progression of degenerative diseases, and aging. Experiments in cell cultures and in animals have clearly shown that Vitamin E has a pivotal role as antioxidant agent against the lipid peroxidation on cell membranes preserving the tissue cells from the oxidative damage. Such a role has been well documented in immune, endothelial, and brain cells from old animals describing how the Vitamin E works both at cytoplasmatic and nuclear levels with an influence on many genes related to the inflammatory/immune response. All these findings have supported a lot of clinical trials in old humans and in inflammatory age-related diseases with however contradictory and inconsistent results and even indicating a dangerous role of Vitamin E able to affect mortality. Various factors can contribute to all the discrepancies. Among them, the doses and the various isoforms of Vitamin E family (\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3,\u03b4 tocopherols and the corresponding tocotrienols) used in different trials. However, the more plausible gap is the poor consideration of the Vitamin E\u2013gene interactions that may open new roadmaps for a correct and personalized Vitamin E supplementation in aging and age-related diseases with satisfactory results in order to reach healthy aging and longevity. In this review, this peculiar nutrigenomic and/or nutrigenetic aspect is reported and discussed at the light of specific polymorphisms affecting the Vitamin E bioactivity.",

The findings of our review showed that BVs are under significant genetic influence at all ages, although different brain regions showed different heritability levels.

The most common transgenic mouse model mimics familial AD, which accounts for a small percentage of cases. The senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) strain is a spontaneous animal model of accelerated aging. Many studies indicate that SAMP8 mice harbor the behavioral and histopathological signatures of AD, namely AD-like cognitive and behavioral alterations, neuropathological phenotypes (neuron and dendrite spine loss, spongiosis, gliosis and cholinergic deficits in the forebrain), \u03b2-amyloid deposits resembling senile plaques, and aberrant hyperphosphorylation of Tau-like neurofibrillary tangles.

Data from several animal studies suggest that the degree and time of calorie restriction (CR) onset, the timing of food intake as well as diet composition, play major roles in promoting health and longevity, breaking the old dogma that only calorie intake is important in extending healthy lifespan. Data from human studies indicate that long-term CR with adequate intake of nutrients results in several metabolic adaptations that reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease and cancer. Moreover, CR opposes the expected age-associated alterations in myocardial stiffness, autonomic function, and gene expression in the human skeletal muscle. However, it is possible that some of the beneficial effects on metabolic health are not entirely due to CR, but to the high quality diets consumed by the CR practitioners, as suggested by data collected in individuals consuming strict vegan diets. More studies are needed to understand the interactions among single nutrient modifications (e.g. protein/aminoacid, fatty acids, vitamins, phytochemicals, and minerals), the degree of CR and the frequency of food consumption in modulating anti-aging metabolic and molecular pathways, and in the prevention of age-associated diseases.",

     "abstract": "Tissue-specific stem cells (TSSCs) are a very unique cell type, with critical and well-defined roles for the homeostasis of high turnover tissues (such as the blood and the skin). Emerging evidence suggests that TSSCs are implicated in malignancies, with several theories being proposed and tested, including many attempts to identify the cells of origin and studies deigned to understand how TSSCs participate in age-related increase in cancer risk. A currently unexplored possibility in this respect is the plausible theory that an oncogenic event that arises at a TSSC would promote tissue replenishment by cells containing these mutations, with progressive propagation of such mutated TSSCs in the niche. Therefore, the effect of a somatic oncogenic event in a single TSSC may have more important implications than previously anticipated, resulting in sustained and progressively higher cancer risk. This model could have important implications for tumor recurrence, since in some cases the underlying cause might be the development of a new tumor originated from daughter cells of the TSSC that suffered the first oncogenic hit, rather than proliferation of residual cancer cells. In this review, we present and discuss approaches for testing the proposed theory of tumorigenesis and cancer risk, as well as practical implications for biomedical research and clinical practice.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common motor system disorder affecting 1\u20132% of people over the age of sixty-five. Although PD is generally a sporadic neurological disorder, the discovery of monogenic, hereditable forms of the disease, representing 5\u201310% of all cases, has been very important in helping to partially delineate the molecular pathways that lead to this pathology. These mechanisms include impairment of the intracellular protein-degradation pathways, protein aggregation, mitochondria dysfunction, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Some of these features are also supported by post-mortem analyses. One of the main pathological hallmarks of PD is the preferential degeneration of dopaminergic neurons, which supports a direct role of dopamine itself in promoting the disorder. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the existing literature that links the aforementioned pathways to the oxidative chemistry of dopamine, ultimately leading to the formation of free radicals and reactive quinone species. We emphasize, in particular, how the reaction of dopamine-derived quinones with several cellular targets could foster the processes involved in the pathogenesis of PD and contribute to the progression of the disorder.",

Frailty is an age-related syndrome described as the decreased ability of an organism to respond to stressors. A number of epidemiological studies have reported that frailty increases the risk of future cognitive decline and that cognitive impairment increases the risk of frailty suggesting that cognition and frailty interact within a cycle of decline associated with ageing.

While these questions have not yet been clearly resolved, several groups of possible theories have been published on this topic. However, most of these theories do not consider plants, and the specific traits involved in their ageing mechanisms. The first trait covers clonality and sectoriality and the second concerns the lack of a differentiated germ line. The lack of a germ line prevents telomere shortening which can lead to the transfer of somatic mutations into sexual offspring, while sectoriality in trees causes isolation of potentially catastrophic events in one tree part, thus creating a population of more or less independent modules within one axis. The processes of population dynamics, including ageing, can act within the framework of an individual tree as well as in that of the population as a whole, although the processes involved differ and consequently result in different effects.",

     "publication date": "09-2013",
     "abstract": "Situations such as the recovery from injury and illness can lead to enforced periods of muscle disuse or unloading. Such circumstances lead to rapid skeletal muscle atrophy, loss of functional strength and a multitude of related negative health consequences. The elderly population is particularly vulnerable to the acute challenges of muscle disuse atrophy. Any loss of skeletal muscle mass must be underpinned by a chronic imbalance between muscle protein synthesis and breakdown rates. It is recognized that muscle atrophy during prolonged (>10 days) disuse is brought about primarily by declines in post-absorptive and post-prandial muscle protein synthesis rates, without a clear contribution from changes in muscle protein breakdown. Few data are available on the impact of short-term disuse (<10 days) on muscle protein turnover in humans. However, indirect evidence indicates that considerable muscle atrophy occurs during this early phase, and is likely attributed to a rapid increase in muscle protein breakdown accompanied by the characteristic decline in muscle protein synthesis. Short-term disuse atrophy is of particular relevance in the development of sarcopenia, as it has been suggested that successive short periods of muscle disuse, due to sickness or injury, accumulate throughout an individual's lifespan and contributes considerably to the net muscle loss observed with aging. Research is warranted to elucidate the physiological and molecular basis for rapid muscle loss during short periods of disuse. Such mechanistic insight will allow the characterization of nutritional, exercise and/or pharmacological interventions to prevent or attenuate muscle loss during periods of disuse and therefore aid in the treatment of age-related sarcopenia.",

     "abstract": "Inflammation is an innate immune response to infection or tissue damage that is designed to limit harm to the host, but contributes significantly to ischemic brain injury following stroke.

Multi-protein complexes known as inflammasomes (e.g. containing NLRP1, NLRP2, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP7, NLRP12, NLRC4, AIM2 and/or Pyrin), then process these signals to trigger an effector response. Briefly, signaling through NLRP1 and NLRP3 inflammasomes produces cleaved caspase-1, which cleaves both pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into their biologically active mature pro-inflammatory cytokines that are released into the extracellular environment. This review will describe the molecular structure, cellular signaling pathways and current evidence for inflammasome activation following cerebral ischemia, and the potential for future treatments for stroke that may involve targeting inflammasome formation or its products in the ischemic brain.",

The aim of this systematic review was to determine the effectiveness of mealtime interventions for the elderly living in residential care. Mealtime interventions were considered as those that aimed to change/improve the mealtime routine, practice, experience or environment. Following comprehensive searches, review and appraisal, 37 articles were included. Inadequate reporting in over half of the articles limited data quality appraisal. Mealtime interventions were categorised into five types: changes to food service, food improvement, dining environment alteration, staff training and feeding assistance. Meta-analysis found inconsistent evidence of effects on body weight of changes to food service (0.5\u00a0kg; 95% CI: \u22121.1 to 2.2; p\u00a0=\u00a00.51), food improvement interventions (0.4\u00a0kg; 95% CI: \u22120.8 to 1.7; p\u00a0=\u00a00.50) or alterations to dining environment (1.5\u00a0kg; 95% CI: \u22120.7 to 2.8; p\u00a0=\u00a00.23). Findings from observational studies within these intervention types were mixed, but generally positive. Observational studies also found positive effects on food/caloric intake across all intervention types, though meta-analyses of randomised studies showed little evidence of any effects on food/caloric intake in food improvement studies (\u22125\u00a0kcal; 95% CI: \u221236 to 26; p\u00a0=\u00a00.74).

The need to improve the nutrition of the elderly living in residential long term care is well recognised. This review found some evidence that simple intervention around various aspects of mealtime practices and the mealtime environment can result in favourable nutritional outcomes. Further large scale pragmatic trials, however, are still required to establish full efficacy of such interventions.",

Though distinct in many ways, Ca2+ and neuroinflammatory signaling mechanisms exhibit extensive cross-talk and bidirectional interactions. For instance, cytokine production in glial cells is strongly dependent on the Ca2+ dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin, which shows elevated activity in animal models of aging and disease. In turn, pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF, can augment the expression/activity of L-type voltage sensitive Ca2+ channels in neurons, leading to Ca2+ dysregulation, hyperactive calcineurin activity, and synaptic depression. Thus, in addition to discussing unique contributions of Ca2+ dyshomeostasis and neuroinflammation, this review emphasizes how these processes interact to hasten age-related synaptic changes.",

After applying exclusion criteria, there were 28 studies eligible for inclusion: 25 cross-sectional and 6 prospective studies (3 studies show cross-sectional as well as prospective data). The main finding of the 25 cross-sectional studies was a statistically significant worse outcome on one or more cognitive function tests or a higher frequency of dementia with lower vitamin D levels or intake in 18 out of 25 (72%) studies, whereas 7 (28%) studies failed to show an association.

We identified miRs that can be considered as senescence-associated (SA-miRs), inflammation-associated (inflamma-miRs) and cancer-associated (onco-miRs). Here we review recent findings concerning three of them, miR-21, -126 and -146a, which target mRNAs belonging to the NF-\u03baB pathway; we discuss their ability to link cellular senescence, inflamm-aging and cancer and their changes in centenarians, and provide an update on the possibility of using miRs to block accumulation of senescent cells to prevent formation of a microenvironment favoring cancer development and progression.",

     "abstract": "Forming the first line of defence against virally infected and malignant cells, natural killer (NK) cells are critical effector cells of the innate immune system. With age, significant impairments have been reported in the two main mechanisms by which NK cells confer host protection: direct cytotoxicity and the secretion of immunoregulatory cytokines and chemokines. In elderly subjects, decreased NK cell activity has been shown to be associated with an increased incidence and severity of viral infection, highlighting the clinical implications that age-associated changes in NK cell biology have on the health of older adults. However, is an increased susceptibility to viral infection the only consequence of these age-related changes in NK cell function? Recently, evidence has emerged that has shown that in addition to eliminating transformed cells, NK cells are involved in many other biological processes such as immune regulation, anti-microbial immune responses and the recognition and elimination of senescent cells, novel functions that involve NK-mediated cytotoxicity and/or cytokine production. Thus, the decrease in NK cell function that accompanies physiological ageing is likely to have wider implications for the health of older adults than originally thought. Here, we give a detailed description of the changes in NK cell biology that accompany human ageing and propose that certain features of the ageing process such as: (i) the increased reactivation rates of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, (ii) the slower resolution of inflammatory responses and (iii) the increased incidence of bacterial and fungal infection are attributable in part to an age-associated decline in NK cell function.",

The association of ACE I/D polymorphism with exceptional longevity was analyzed in a total of 1803 centenarians and 10,484 controls using the chi-square test with the Yates correction. We conducted combined analyses for all ethnic groups studied in the literature (Caucasian, Chinese and Korean) as well as for Caucasians only. The DD genotype (odds ratio (OR): 1.25 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02\u20131.54), P\u00a0=\u00a00.032) and the D-allele were more frequent in Caucasian centenarians compared with their younger controls (OR: 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05\u20131.28), P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Similar findings were obtained when all ethnic origin groups were included in the analyses, with no evidence of publication bias or heterogeneity (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The present meta-analysis indicates that the ACE D-allele and the DD genotype might confer a modest, albeit significant advantage to reach exceptional longevity.",

The intricate wiring of the brain at both the system and molecular level is both spatially and temporally regulated in perfect synchrony. How such a delicate, yet elegant, system arises from an embryo's most basic cells remains at the forefront of neuroscientific research. At the cellular level, the competitive dance between synapses struggling to gain dominance seems to be refereed by both neurons themselves and microglia, the innate immune cells of the nervous system. Additionally, the unexpected complement cascade, a major effecter arm of the innate immune system, is almost certainly involved in synaptic remodeling by tagging destined neurons and synapses for destruction. As suddenly as they appear, the mechanisms of neurogenesis recede entering into adulthood. However, with age and insult, these mechanisms boisterously return, resulting in neurodegeneration. This review describes some of the mechanisms involved in synaptogenesis and wiring of the brain from the point of view of the innate immune system and then covers how similar molecular processes return with age and disease, specifically in the context of Alzheimer's disease.",

In the case of Alzheimer's disease (AD), synapse loss is the strongest pathological correlate of cognitive decline, indicating that synaptic degeneration plays a central role in dementia. Over the past decade, strong evidence has emerged that oligomeric forms of amyloid beta, the protein that accumulates in senile plaques in the AD brain, contribute to degeneration of synaptic structure and function. More recent data indicate that pathological forms of tau protein, which accumulate in neurofibrillary tangles in the AD brain, also cause synaptic dysfunction and loss. In this review, we will present the case that soluble forms of both amyloid beta and tau protein act at the synapse to cause neural network dysfunction, and further that these two pathological proteins may act in concert to cause synaptic pathology. These data may have wide-ranging implications for the targeting of soluble pathological proteins in neurodegenerative diseases to prevent or reverse cognitive decline.",

The neurological activities of insulin, orexin and leptin also include facilitation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and enhancement of cognitive performance. While patients with metabolic disorders such as obesity and diabetes have greater risk of developing cognitive deficits, dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD), the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for, or contribute to, age-related cognitive decline are poorly understood. In view of the importance of these peptides in metabolic disorders, it is not surprising that there is a greater focus on their potential role in cognitive deficits associated with aging. The goal of this review is to describe the evidence from clinical and pre-clinical studies implicating insulin, orexin and leptin in the etiology and progression of age-related cognitive decline.

     "abstract": "The decision between cellular survival and death is governed by a balance between proapoptotic versus antiapoptotic signaling cascades. Growth factors are key actors, playing two main roles both at developmental and adult stages: a supporting antiapoptotic role through diverse actions converging in the mitochondria, and a promoter role of cell maturation and plasticity through dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis, especially relevant for the adult hippocampal neurogenesis, a case of development during adulthood. Here, both parallel roles mutually feed forward each other (the success in avoiding apoptosis lets the cell to grow and differentiate, which in turn lets the cell to reach new targets and form new synapses accessing new sources of growth factors to support cell survival) in a circular cause and consequence, or a \u201cthe chicken or the egg\u201d dilemma. While identifying the first case of this dilemma makes no sense, one possible outcome might have biological relevance: the decision between survival and death in the adult hippocampal neurogenesis is mainly concentrated at a specific time window, and recent data suggest some divergences between the survival and the maturational promoter effect of growth factors. This review summarizes these evidences suggesting how growth factors might contribute to the live-or-die decision of adult-born immature granule neurons through influencing the maturation of the young neuron by means of its connectivity into a mature functional circuit.",

Wnt ligands have been implicated in the regulation of synaptic assembly as well as in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. Deregulation of Wnt signaling has been associated with several pathologies, and more recently has been related to neurodegenerative diseases and to mental and mood disorders. In this review, we focus our attention on the Wnt signaling cascade in postnatal life and we review in detail the presence of Wnt signaling components in pre- and postsynaptic regions. Due to the important role of Wnt proteins in wiring neural circuits, we discuss recent findings about the role of Wnt pathways both in basal spontaneous activities as well as in activity-dependent processes that underlie synaptic plasticity. Finally, we review the role of Wnt in vivo and we finish with the most recent data in literature that involves the effect of components of the Wnt signaling pathway in neurological and mental disorders, including a special emphasis on in vivo studies that relate behavioral abnormalities to deficiencies in Wnt signaling, as well as the data that support a neuroprotective role of Wnt proteins in relation to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",

Several proteins and pathways have been identified as mediators of developmental neuronal migration and cell positioning. However, these pathways do not cease to be functionally relevant after the embryonic and early postnatal period; instead, they switch from guiding cells, to guiding synapses. The outcome of synaptic guidance determines the strength and plasticity of neuronal networks by creating a scalable functional architecture that is sculpted by cues from the internal and external environment. Reelin is a multifunctional signal that coordinates cortical and subcortical morphogenesis during development and regulates structural plasticity in adulthood and aging. Gain or loss of function in reelin or its receptors has the potential to influence synaptic strength and patterns of connectivity, with consequences for memory and cognition.

We focus in particular on neuroimaging studies of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) network, which is involved in episodic memory and is known to change both with age and with AD pathology. We propose a temporal model of structural and functional alterations in the MTL along the aging-dementia continuum. The earliest changes are synaptic in nature and are detectable in particularly vulnerable white matter pathways such as the perforant path. These are followed by structural degradation in the transentorhinal region and subsequently neurodegeneration of the hippocampus as a result of accumulating pathology as well as deafferentation from entorhinal input. We believe that testing this model explicitly is an important direction for future research, particularly in the context of biomarker discovery and clinical trial design.",

     "abstract": "Functional neuroimaging studies have consistently reported age-related changes in prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity during a variety of cognitive tasks, including episodic memory. These changes are often interpreted within the context of one of the following three neural models of age-related changes in brain function: dedifferentiation, neural inefficiency, and neural plasticity and compensation models. Distinguishing between these competing models has proven difficult when interpreting results using functional imaging data alone. In this paper we suggest that a more accurate interpretation of age-related changes in PFC activity requires consideration of age-related differences in gray matter volume (GMv) in PFC and the medial temporal lobes (MTL). We review fMRI studies of cognitive aging that have directly examined the relationship between PFC activity and both local (PFC) and distal (MTL) GMv in older versus younger adults. We also considered how structure\u2013function relationships may be further modified in pathological aging (i.e. mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)).We found that when task performance was matched between age-groups there was a negative association between regional PFC volume and activity in older adults. However, when older adults performed worse than young adults we observed a positive association between volume and activity in right lateral PFC. Additionally during memory tasks, several studies revealed that PFC activity is positively related to GM volume in MTL in healthy older adults, but negatively related in MCI and AD patients. We conclude that PFC activity is related to age-related changes in local and distal GM volume reductions and that consideration of these structural measures aids the interpretation of fMRI results. Furthermore, the study of structure\u2013function relationships may provide important insights into the biological mechanisms underlying healthy versus pathological aging.",

There is emerging evidence of important crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy which can be linked to inflammasome activation. Beclin 1 is a platform protein which assembles an interactome consisting of diverse proteins which control the initiation of autophagocytosis and distinct phases in endocytosis. Recent studies have demonstrated that the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members can interact with Beclin 1 and inhibit autophagy. Consequently, impaired autophagy can trigger inflammasome activation. Interestingly, the hallmarks of the ageing process include a decline in autophagy, increased resistance to apoptosis and a low-grade inflammatory phenotype. Age-related stresses, e.g. genotoxic, metabolic and environmental insults, enhance the expression of NF-\u03baB-driven anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins which repress the Beclin 1-dependent autophagy. Suppression of autophagocytosis provokes inflammation including NF-\u03baB activation which further potentiates anti-apoptotic defence. In a context-dependent manner, this feedback defence mechanism can enhance the aging process or provoke tumorigenesis or cellular senescence. We will review the role of Beclin 1 interactome in the crosstalk between apoptosis, autophagy and inflammasomes emphasizing that disturbances in Beclin 1-dependent autophagy can have a crucial impact on the aging process.",

Inclusion of people with dementia in the development process of user-friendly, supportive IT applications may be especially useful to improve the quality of these applications and may be beneficial to the person with dementia. The aim of this study was to gain insight into the involvement of people with dementia in developing supportive IT applications. The focus of involvement was on phase, methods, role and impact on the quality of the IT application and on the person with dementia.A systematic search was undertaken using Cochrane Library, PubMED, PsycInfo, EMBASE, and CINAHL. Publications were selected using the following inclusion criteria: publications had to address a development process of an IT application involving people with dementia. The BMJ checklist was used to assess the quality of the included publications.Twenty-six publications relating to 15 IT programs met the inclusion criteria. People with dementia were mainly involved in the exploratory and technical development phases. The methods most frequently used to involve the participants were interviews, observations and usability try-outs. In most studies, participants were objects of study and informants. People with dementia provided useful feedback and gave valuable recommendations for researchers and designers regarding the development of user-friendly, supportive, IT applications. Involvement in all phases may have empowering effects on people with dementia.To develop valuable, user-friendly, supportive IT applications that increase the quality of life of people with dementia involvement in all phases of the development process is of great importance.",

The dearth may result from recruitment challenges faced by fall-related studies that capture data on movement and activity in older adults.

Authors conducted a systematic review of methods used to recruit elderly individuals for \u201cactivity-related fall studies\u201d that assessed subjects\u2019 movement and mobility, and investigated incidence of real falls. The review highlighted effective recruitment strategies and identified challenges across several settings. Literature review findings were compared to recruitment challenges encountered in an activity-related fall study from 2011, focused on enrolling a target group of older adults with both high risk of falling and the requisite cognitive capacity to adhere to activity protocols. The analysis yielded several recommendations for improving recruitment of older adults for activity-related fall studies, including: recruiting from community-based settings; utilizing short-term activity protocols to promote involvement among institutionalized elderly; establishing eligibility criteria that may include those with lower cognitive functioning, mobility restrictions, and co-morbidities; employing direct-mail recruitment methods; and utilizing intermediaries to recruit institutionalized elderly.",

     "abstract": "Although the effects of malnutrition on morbidity and mortality of older people is well established, there has been little work done to investigate the relationship between malnutrition and quality of life (QoL) in this population. In order to facilitate further research and to aggregate existing evidence into a clear overview, a systematic review was conducted. The objective was to identify the literature on the topic, review the findings systematically, and assess the association between nutritional status and QoL. MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science were searched for relevant studies published up to April 2011. References within identified studies also searched. The primary author extracted all data using a purpose-built form, and evaluated the quality of the studies using a published checklist. A second reviewer checked a random sample of articles independently.Evidence in the current review comes from both cohort studies and intervention trials. Results from the former suggested that individuals with malnutrition are more likely to experience poor QoL (OR: 2.85; 95% CI: 2.20\u20133.70, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Consistent with this, interventions designed to improve nutritional status can also lead to significant improvements in QoL, both physical (standard mean difference 0.23, CI: 0.08\u20130.38, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and mental aspects (standard mean difference 0.24, CI: 0.11\u20130.36, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, the results should be interpreted with caution in view of the poor quality of the included studies and the heterogeneity of methods employed in the assessment of both nutritional status and QoL. Future studies should carefully characterise their participants and use standardised parameters for nutritional and QoL assessments in order to achieve better evaluation and comparability of study results.",

     "abstract": "Life's timekeeper is a \u2018free-running\u2019 intracellular oscillator synchronised across all cells. It runs throughout life splitting lifespan into equal length phases. During the maturational period it controls the overall rate of progression whereas in the post-maturational period it controls the overall rate of ageing. This includes the rate of senescence and hence time to death. As such life's timekeeper equates maturational and post-maturational time, hence explains the tight correlation between these time periods that has existed throughout mammalian evolution.Life's timekeeper is proposed to have played an important role in vertebrate evolution. A slower oscillatory frequency results in proportional life phase prolongation. This leads to increased body and brain size, together with extended lifespan. Higher brain centres, neocortex in mammals, are disproportionately enlarged. Hence behavioural capacity is increased. The extended post-maturational period ensures that there is enough time in order that the behavioural advantages can be fully manifest in the environment. A faster oscillatory frequency would result in proportional life phase reduction. This process however would lead to reduced behavioural capacity, and is hence unlikely to be positively selected. Therefore throughout evolution life's timekeeper has operated to extend lifespan. It has hence functioned to promote longevity as opposed to ageing.",

     "abstract": "The increasing life expectancy in the populations of rich countries raises the pressing question of how the elderly can maintain their cognitive function. Cognitive decline is characterised by the loss of short-term memory due to a progressive impairment of the underlying brain cell processes. Age-related brain damage has many causes, some of which may be influenced by diet. An optimal diet may therefore be a practical way of delaying the onset of age-related cognitive decline. Nutritional investigations indicate that the \u03c9-3 poyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content of western diets is too low to provide the brain with an optimal supply of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the main \u03c9-3 PUFA in cell membranes. Insufficient brain DHA has been associated with memory impairment, emotional disturbances and altered brain processes in rodents. Human studies suggest that an adequate dietary intake of \u03c9-3 PUFA can slow the age-related cognitive decline and may also protect against the risk of senile dementia. However, despite the many studies in this domain, the beneficial impact of \u03c9-3 PUFA on brain function has only recently been linked to specific mechanisms.This review examines the hypothesis that an optimal brain DHA status, conferred by an adequate \u03c9-3 PUFA intake, limits age-related brain damage by optimizing endogenous brain repair mechanisms. Our analysis of the abundant literature indicates that an adequate amount of DHA in the brain may limit the impact of stress, an important age-aggravating factor, and influences the neuronal and astroglial functions that govern and protect synaptic transmission. This transmission, particularly glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus, underlies memory formation. The brain DHA status also influences neurogenesis, nested in the hippocampus, which helps maintain cognitive function throughout life.Although there are still gaps in our knowledge of the way \u03c9-3 PUFA act, the mechanistic studies reviewed here indicate that \u03c9-3 PUFA may be a promising tool for preventing age-related brain deterioration.",

This paper provides the first comprehensive overview of the current state of art on molecular mechanisms underlying HPMC senescence in vitro. Special attention is paid to the causes of the very fast dynamics of HPMC senescence, and in particular to the role of non-telomeric DNA damage, the autocrine activity of TGF-\u03b21, and the causative effects of oxidative stress. In addition, some clinical manifestations of HPMC senescence will be discussed, including its interplay with organismal aging, peritoneal dialysis, and cancer progression.",

There are many anthropological techniques to estimate the age at death in children and adults. However, in adults this methodology is less accurate and requires population specific references. For that reason, new methodologies have been developed. Biochemical methods are based on the natural process of ageing, which induces different biochemical changes that lead to alterations in cells and tissues. In this review, we describe different attempts to estimate the age in adults based on these changes. Chemical approaches imply modifications in molecules or accumulation of some products. Molecular biology approaches analyze the modifications in DNA and chromosomes. Although the most accurate technique appears to be aspartic acid racemization, it is important to take into account the other techniques because the forensic context and the human remains available will determine the possibility to apply one or another methodology.",

We reviewed evidence for the biomechanical mechanisms of how strength and power training increase gait speed in old adults.

A secondary analysis of 20 studies revealed an association of r2\u00a0=\u00a00.21 between the 22% and 12% increase, respectively, in quadriceps strength and gait velocity in 815 individuals age 72.

To increase the efficacy of intervention studies designed to improve gait speed and other critical mobility functions in old adults, there is a need for a paradigm shift from conventional (clinical) outcome assessments to more sophisticated biomechanical analyses that examine joint kinematics, kinetics, energetics, muscle-tendon function, and musculoskeletal modeling before and after interventions.",

The major risk factor for DC is to carry germline telomere-related mutations \u2013 in telomerase or telomere shelterin genes \u2013 which results in premature telomere dysfunction, thus increasing the risk of premature aging impairments. Despite the advances that have been accomplished in DC research, the molecular aspects underlying the phenotypic variability of the disease remain poorly understood. Here different aspects of telomere biology, concerning adult stem cells senescence, tumor suppression and cancer are considered in the context of DC, resulting in two translational models: late onset of DC symptoms in telomere-related mutations carriers is a potential indicator of increased cancer risk and differences in tumor suppression capacities among the genetic subgroups are (at least partial) causes of different clinical manifestations of the disease. The limitations of both models are presented, and further experiments for their validation, as well as clinical implications, are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Hormesis is the response of organisms to a mild stressor resulting in improved health and longevity. Mild heat shocks have been thought to induce hormetic response because they promote increased activity of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which may extend lifespan. Using data from 27 studies on 12 animal species, we performed a comparative meta-analysis to quantify the effect of heat shock exposure on longevity. Contrary to our expectations, heat shock did not measurably increase longevity in the overall meta-analysis, although we observed much heterogeneity among studies. Thus, we explored the relative contributions of different experimental variables (i.e. moderators). Higher temperatures, longer durations of heat shock exposure, increased shock repeat and less time between repeat shocks, all decreased the likelihood of a life-extending effect, as would be expected when a hormetic response crosses the threshold to being a damaging exposure. We conclude that there is limited evidence that mild heat stress is a universal way of promoting longevity at the whole-organism level. Life extension via heat-induced hormesis is likely to be constrained to a narrow parameter window of experimental conditions.",

The analysis of N-glycome, i.e. the sugar chains N-linked to asparagine, identified new candidate biomarkers of aging such as N-glycans devoid of galactose residues on their branches, in a variety of human and experimental model systems, such as healthy old people, centenarians and their offspring and caloric restricted mice. These agalactosylated biantennary structures mainly decorate Asn297 of Fc portion of IgG (IgG-G0), and are present also in patients affected by progeroid syndromes and a variety of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases. IgG-G0 exert a pro-inflammatory effect through different mechanisms, including the lectin pathway of complement, binding to Fc\u03b3 receptors and formation of autoantibody aggregates. The age-related accumulation of IgG-G0 can contribute to inflammaging, the low-grade pro-inflammatory status that characterizes elderly, by creating a vicious loop in which inflammation is responsible for the production of aberrantly glycosylated IgG which, in turn, would activate the immune system, exacerbating inflammation. Moreover, recent data suggest that the N-glycomic shift observed in aging could be related not only to inflammation but also to alteration of important metabolic pathways. Thus, altered N-glycans are both powerful markers of aging and possible contributors to its pathogenesis.",

Definitions of frailty vary widely, and prevalence estimates are affected by the way frailty is defined. Systematic reviews have yet to examine the literature on the association between definitions of frailty and mortality.We examined the definitions and prevalence of frailty and its association with survival in older community-dwelling adults. We conducted a systematic review of observational population-based studies published in English. We calculated pooled prevalence of frailty with a random effects model.We identified 24 population-based studies that examined frailty in community-dwelling older adults. The pooled prevalence was 14% when frailty was defined as a phenotype exhibiting three or more of the following: weight loss, fatigue/exhaustion, weakness, low physical activity/slowness, and mobility impairment. The pooled prevalence was 24% when frailty was defined by accumulation of deficits indices that included up to 75 diseases and impairments. The prevalence of frailty increased with age and was greater in women and in African Americans. Frailty in older adults was associated with poor survival with a dose\u2013responsive reduction in survival per increasing number of frailty criteria. Taking into account population prevalence and multivariate adjusted relative risks, we estimated that 3\u20135% of deaths among older adults could be delayed if frailty was prevented.Frailty is a prevalent and important geriatric syndrome associated with decreased survival. Geriatric assessment of frailty provides clinically important information about functional status and survival of older adults.",

     "abstract": "The mouse has become the favorite mammalian model. Among the many reasons for this privileged position of mice is their genetic proximity to humans, the possibilities of genetically manipulating their genomes and the availability of many tools, mutants and inbred strains. Also in the field of aging, mice have become very robust and reliable research tools. Since laboratory mice have a life expectancy of only a few years, genetic approaches and other strategies for intervening in aging can be tested by examining their effects on life span and aging parameters during the relatively short period of, for example, a PhD project. Moreover, experiments on mice with an extended life span as well as on mice demonstrating signs of (segmental) premature aging, together with genetic mapping strategies, have provided novel insights into the fundamental processes that drive aging. Finally, the results of studies on caloric restriction and pharmacological anti-aging treatments in mice have a high degree of relevance to humans. In this paper, we review a number of recent genetic mapping studies that have yielded novel insights into the aging process. We discuss the value of the mouse as a model for testing interventions in aging, such as caloric restriction, and we critically discuss mouse strains with an extended or a shortened life span as models of aging.",

A body of recent work has focused on the relationship between mitochondrial redox state, aging and dietary interventions that affect lifespan. These studies have uncovered mechanisms through which diet alters mitochondrial metabolism, in addition to determining how these changes affect oxidant generation, which in itself has an impact on mitochondrial function in aged animals. Many of the studies conducted to date, however, are correlative, and it remains to be determined which of the energy metabolism and redox modifications induced by diet are central toward lifespan extent. Furthermore, dietary interventions used for laboratory animals are often unequal, and of difficult comparison with humans (for whom, by nature, no long-term sound scientific information on the effects of diet on mitochondrial redox state and aging is available). We hope future studies will be able to mechanistically characterize which energy metabolism and redox changes promoted by dietary interventions have positive lifespan effects, and translate these findings into human prevention and treatment of age-related disease.",

     "abstract": "Elder abuse has devastating consequences for older persons such as a poor quality of life, psychological distress, and loss of property and security. It is also associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Elder abuse is a problem that manifests itself in both rich and poor countries and at all levels of society. It is timely to discuss one of the basic problems that has hampered the study, detection and intervention of elder abuse as the variety of definitions that exist now produce a definitional chaos for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers.In this article we trace the elements of \u201chow to define elder abuse\u201d and situate them in their socio-historical context. We also analyze the purposes of these different definitions to assess their appropriateness in different settings concerned with elder abuse. Our analysis shows that elder abuse mirrors the societal arrangements which gave rise to them. It also highlights that it is a complex problem that is difficult to define. The central question is whether we need a common definition of elder abuse or different definitions that can be used in different settings. By evidence of our analysis we can see that there is a need for a sufficiently broad and flexible definition in order to cover different behaviors that can constitute abuse and the various settings in which it may occur. On the other hand, the definition needs to be specific and concrete to be useful in professional contexts.To take a further step forward for both research and practice of elder abuse, we propose to consistently adhere to the WHO definition that leads the enquirer towards a better understanding of the problem and helps to distinguish it from other phenomena; and to a simplified definition for professional practice that sets boundaries to the phenomena and is appropriate for effective prevention and intervention measures.",

In addition, none of the about another dozen documented ageing mechanisms seems to hold the final answer as to the ultimate cause and evolutionary significance of ageing. This review raises the question whether, perhaps, something important has been overlooked, namely a biophysical principle, electrical in nature. The first cell on earth started to be alive when its system for generating its own electricity, carried by inorganic ions, became operational. Any cell dies at the very moment that this system irreversibly collapses. In between birth and death, the system is subject to wear and tear because any cell's overall repair system is not 100 percent waterproof; otherwise adaptation would not be an option. The Fading Electricity Theory of Ageing has all necessary properties for acting as a universal major integrative concept. The advent of novel methods will facilitate the study of bioelectrical phenomena with molecular biological methods in combination with optogenetics, thereby offering challenging possibilities for innovative research in evo-gero.",

Cytoskeletal proteins undergo post-translational modifications to define their structure and function. In depression and other psychiatric disorders, post-translational modifications may be disrupted that can result in altered cytoskeletal functions. The disruption of microtubule and actin in terms of morphology and functions may be a leading cause of dendritic regression and decrease in dendritic spine in depression.",

As more individuals live longer, we should try to understand the mechanisms involved in healthy ageing and preserving functional independence in later life. In elderly people, functional independence is directly dependent on physical fitness, and ageing is inevitably associated with the declining functions of systems and organs (heart, lungs, blood vessels, skeletal muscles) that determine physical fitness. Thus, age-related diminished physical fitness contributes to the development of sarcopenia, frailty or disability, all of which severely deteriorate independent living and thus quality of life. Ageing is a complex process involving many variables that interact with one another, including \u2013 besides lifestyle factors or chronic diseases \u2013 genetics. Thus, several studies have examined the contribution of genetic endowment to a decline in physical fitness and subsequent loss of independence in later life. In this review, we compile information, including data from heritability, candidate-gene association, linkage and genome-wide association studies, on genetic factors that could influence physical fitness in the elderly.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related, progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disease that results in the loss of selected neurons throughout the basal forebrain, amygdala, hippocampus, and cortical area as well as progressive deficits of cognition and memory. The subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is one of the regions where adult neurogenesis occurs in mammals, including humans and non-human primates. The new granule cells, which are the primary excitatory neurons in the DG, contribute to the processes of learning and memory. The changes in neurogenesis observed during the initial stages and progression of AD suggest that the modulation of the new production of neurons at neurogenic sites may exert profound effects on hippocampal function. Bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP4) and its antagonist Noggin contribute to the modulation of neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus, thereby affecting hippocampal function. This review focuses on the role of BMP4 and Noggin in the control of the stem and precursor cells in the adult hippocampus during AD and their potential as a possible therapeutic strategy for AD sufferers. It is helpful to extend the understanding of the control of stem cells in the normal and diseased hippocampus.",

     "abstract": "Aim of the study was to analyze temporal trends in prevalence of hyponatremia over four decades in different settings. A systematic review of the literature from 1966 to 2009 yielded prevalences of hyponatremia, with standard errors (SE) and pooled estimated means (PEM), calculated by year and setting (geriatric, ICU, other hospital wards, psychiatric hospitals, nursing homes, outpatients). 53 studies were included. Prevalence of hyponatremia was stable from 1976 to 2006, and higher on geriatric wards accept for ICU: e.g. PEM prevalence of mild hyponatremia (serum sodium <135\u00a0mM) was 22.2% (95%CI 20.2\u201324.3) on geriatric wards, 6.0% (95%CI 5.9\u20136.1) on other hospital wards and 17.2% (SE 7.0) in one ICU-study; for severe hyponatremia (serum sodium\u00a0<\u00a0125\u00a0mM) these figures were 4.5% (95%CI 3.0\u20136.1), 0.8% (95%CI 0.7\u20130.8) and 10.3% (SE 5.6). In nursing homes PEM prevalence of mild hyponatremia was 18.8% (95%CI 15.6\u201322.2). The higher prevalence on geriatric wards could partly be explained by age-related changes in the regulation of serum sodium. Other underlying factors can be the presence of multiple diagnoses and the use of polypharmacy.",

Mounting evidence has suggested the active interplay between the two pathways. Studies have shown that \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) can be internalized and generated intracellularly, accelerating NFT formation. Conversely, tau elements in NFTs are observed to affect A\u03b2 and amyloid plaque formation. Yet the precise mechanisms which link the pathologies of the two brain lesions remain elusive. In this review, we discuss recent evidence that support five putative mechanisms by which crosstalk occurs between amyloid plaque and NFT formation in AD pathogenesis. Understanding the crosstalks in the formation of AD pathologies could provide new clues for the development of novel therapeutic strategies to delay or halt the progression of AD.",

Although modern technologies allow us high-throughput profiling of epigenetic patterns already at genome level, our understanding of genetic and environmental influences on the epigenetic processes remains limited. Twins are of special interest for genetic studies due to their genetic similarity and rearing-environment sharing. The classical twin design has made a great contribution in dissecting the genetic and environmental contributions to human diseases and complex traits. In the era of functional genomics, the valuable sample of twins is helping to bridge the gap between gene activity and the environments through epigenetic mechanisms unlimited by DNA sequence variations. We propose to extend the classical twin design to study the aging-related molecular epigenetic phenotypes and link them with environmental exposures especially early life events. Different study designs and application issues will be highlighted and novel approaches introduced with aim at making uses of twins in assessing the environmental impact on epigenetic changes during development and in the aging process.",

These changes, however, are associated with different patterns of structural and functional alterations in the neural network of navigation. In AD, these changes occur in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, parietal lobe, retrosplenial cortex, prefrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus, whereas in aging, modifications occur mainly in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The navigation abilities of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been found to show different performance patterns, depending on their cognitive profiles. Since patients with MCI do not uniformly develop dementia of the Alzheimer type, it is important to identify reliable early cognitive markers of conversion to AD dementia. In this review, we propose that navigation deficits may help distinguish patients at higher risk of developing AD dementia from individuals with normal cognitive aging and those with other neurodegenerative diseases.",

We identify the roots of this fallacy in the otherwise seminal works of Medawar and Comfort, and explain that under antagonistic pleiotropy or disposable soma explanations for the evolution of senescence there is no reason why senescence cannot evolve to be manifest within the life expectancies of wild organisms. The recent emergence of long-term field studies presents irrefutable evidence that senescence is commonly detected in nature. We found such evidence in 175 different animal species from 340 separate studies. Although the bulk of this evidence comes from birds and mammals, we also found evidence for senescence in other vertebrates and insects. We describe how high-quality longitudinal field data allow us to test evolutionary explanations for differences in senescence between the sexes and among traits and individuals. Recent studies indicate that genes, prior environment and investment in growth and reproduction influence aging rates in the wild. We argue that \u2013 with the fallacy that wild animals do not senesce finally dead and buried \u2013 collaborations between bio-gerontologists and field biologists can begin to test the ecological generality of purportedly \u2018public\u2019 mechanisms regulating aging in laboratory models.",

An inductive qualitative approach, based on the \u2018grounded theory\u2019 of Glaser and Straus, was used. Twenty-two studies emphasizing on exercise therapy for OAk, collected from three Cochrane reviews and nine guidelines of the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDRO) published between 2000 and 2012, were included. The introduction and discussion parts of these papers were screened for explanations of exercise-induced benefits in OAk patients. Seventy-three key points were identified which were subdivided into 16 core theoretical concepts. Finally, 5 categories were formed: neuromuscular, peri-articular, intra-articular, psychosocial components, and general fitness and health. We referred to scientific evidence that was used in the included studies to describe and categorize the concepts. Future research on exercise in OAk should allow distinguishing the contribution of different potential pathways to the treatment effects.",

In animals, autophagy works as a central process in cellular quality control by removing waste or excess proteins and organelles. Impaired autophagy and the age-related decline of this pathway favour the pathogenesis of many diseases that occur especially at higher age such as neurodegenerative diseases and cancer. Caloric restriction (CR) promotes longevity and healthy ageing. Currently, the contributing role of autophagy in the context of CR-induced health benefits is being unravelled. Furthermore recent studies imply that the advantages from polyphenol consumption may be also connected to autophagy induction.In this review, the literature on autophagy regulation by (dietary) polyphenols such as resveratrol, catechin, quercetin, silibinin and curcumin is discussed with a focus on the underlying molecular mechanisms.

This yielded ninety-four studies, of which fifteen were randomised controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria. The analysis included 718 subjects (407 receiving cognitive stimulation and 311 in control groups). Results were subjected to a meta-analysis. A consistent significant benefit to cognitive function was identified following treatment and the benefits appeared to be over and above any medication effects. This remained evident at follow-up up to three months after the end of treatment. In secondary analyses, with smaller total sample sizes, significant benefits were also noted for quality of life and well-being, and on staff ratings of communication and social interaction. No differences in relation to mood, activities of daily living or challenging behaviour were noted. There is consistent evidence that cognitive stimulation interventions benefit cognitive function and aspects of well-being.

The purpose of the present review was to update the recent systematic reviews of Papp et al. (2009) and Martin et al. (2011), to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive interventions in healthy older adults and people with MCI, by taking into account the methodological quality of the interventions studies. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT) and clinical studies published between August 2007 and February 2012 in Pubmed and PsychINFO was performed. The quality of the included RCTs was assessed according to the CONSORT criteria for RCTs. A total of thirty-five studies were included; twenty-seven RTCs and eight clinical studies. The content of the intervention studies differed widely, as did the methodological quality of the included RCTs, but was considerably low with an average of 44% of the Consort items included. The results show evidence that cognitive training can be effective in improving various aspects of objective cognitive functioning; memory performance, executive functioning, processing speed, attention, fluid intelligence, and subjective cognitive performance. However, the issue whether the effects of cognitive interventions generalize to improvement in everyday life activities is still unresolved and needs to be addressed more explicitly in future research.",

As an adaptor protein, CKIP-1 is involved in various important signaling pathways, controlling cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation, cytoskeleton and bone formation.

     "abstract": "According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, accumulation of the amyloid peptide A\u03b2, derived by proteolytic processing from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), is the key pathogenic trigger in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This view has led researchers for more than two decades and continues to be the most influential model of neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, close scrutiny of the current evidence does not support a central pathogenic role for A\u03b2 in late-onset AD. Furthermore, the amyloid cascade hypothesis lacks a theoretical foundation from which the physiological generation of A\u03b2 can be understood, and therapeutic approaches based on its premises have failed.We present an alternative model of neurodegeneration, in which sustained cholesterol-associated neuronal distress is the most likely pathogenic trigger in late-onset AD, directly causing oxidative stress, inflammation and tau hyperphosphorylation. In this scenario, A\u03b2 generation is part of an APP-driven adaptive response to the initial cholesterol distress, and its accumulation is neither central to, nor a requirement for, the initiation of the disease. Our model provides a theoretical framework that places APP as a regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, accounts for the generation of A\u03b2 in both healthy and demented brains, and provides suitable targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Normally an increase in food intake is observed around 55 years of age, which is followed by a reduction in food intake in individuals over 65 years of age. This reduction in dietary intake results in lowered levels of body fat and body weight, a phenomenon known as anorexia of aging. Anorexia of aging has a variety of consequences, including a decline in functional status, impaired muscle function, decreased bone mass, micronutrient deficiencies, reduced cognitive functions, increased hospital admission and even premature death. Several changes during lifetime have been implicated to play a role in the reduction in food intake and the development of anorexia of aging. These changes are both physiological, involving peripheral hormones, senses and central brain regulation and non-physiological, with differences in psychological and social factors. In the present review, we will focus on age-related changes in physiological and especially non-physiological factors, that play a role in the age-related changes in food intake and in the etiology of anorexia of aging. At the end we conclude with suggestions for future nutritional research to gain greater understanding of the development of anorexia of aging which could lead to earlier detection and better prevention.",

The risk of progression of BADL disability in older adults with a medium/high PA level compared with those with a low PA level was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.71; p\u00a0<\u00a0001), based on four studies involving 8500 participants.This is the first meta-analysis to show that being physically active prevents and slows down the disablement process in aging or diseased populations, positioning PA as the most effective preventive strategy in preventing and reducing disability, independence and health care cost in aging societies.",

Studies were included if they reported prevalence rates of mental disorders in older people (50+ years) from the community. The final sample comprised 25 studies. Prevalence rates were extracted, and effect sizes were transformed into logits. Random-effects models were calculated due to significant heterogeneity. In meta-regression analyses possible sources of bias, including age of onset, gender distribution, and risk of bias were examined. To analyze the robustness of the results, sensitivity analyses were performed. Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and the Egger method.Disorders with the highest prevalence estimates were dimensional depression (19.47%), lifetime major depression (16.52%), and lifetime alcohol use disorders (11.71%). Disorders with the lowest estimates were current and lifetime drug use disorders (0.34% and 0.19%, respectively), and current bipolar disorder and current agoraphobia (both 0.53%).The majority of studies investigated major depression, panic disorder and social phobia. Future research requires a larger database on the epidemiology of mental disorders in the elderly.

In normal cells, low-level concentrations of these compounds are required for signal transduction before their elimination. However, cancer cells, which exhibit an accelerated metabolism, demand high ROS concentrations to maintain their high proliferation rate. Different ways of developing ROS resistance include the execution of alternative pathways, which can avoid large amounts of ROS accumulation without compromising the energy demand required by cancer cells. Examples of these processes include the guidance of the glycolytic pathway into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and/or the generation of lactate instead of employing aerobic respiration in the mitochondria. Importantly, ROS levels can be used as a thermostat to monitor the damage that cells can bear. The implications for ROS regulation are highly significant for cancer therapy because commonly used radio- and chemotherapeutic drugs influence tumor outcome through ROS modulation. Moreover, the discovery of novel biomarkers that are able to predict the clinical response to pro-oxidant therapies is a crucial challenge to overcome to allow for the personalization of cancer therapies.",

Modern imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have enabled the examination of WM microstructural changes across the lifespan, but there is limited knowledge about the role genetics plays in the pattern and aetiology of age-related WM microstructural changes. Family and twin studies suggest that the heritability of WM integrity measures changes over the lifespan, with the common DTI measure, fractional anisotropy (FA), showing moderate to high heritability in adults. However, few heritability studies have been undertaken in older adults. Linkage studies in middle-aged adults suggest that specific regions on chromosomes 3 and 15 may harbour genetic variants for WM integrity. A number of studies have investigated candidate genes, with the APOE \u025b4 polymorphism being the most frequently studied. Although these candidate gene studies suggest associations of particular genes with WM integrity measures in some specific brain regions, the findings remain inconsistent due to differences in their methodologies, samples and the outcome measures used. The APOE \u025b4 allele has been associated with decreased WM integrity (FA) in the cingulum, corpus callosum and parahippocampal gyrus. Only one genome-wide association study of global WM integrity measures in older adults has been published, and reported suggestive single nucleotide polymorphisms await replication. Overall, genetic age-related WM integrity studies are lacking and a concerted effort to examine the genetic determinants of age-related decline in WM integrity is clearly needed to improve our understanding of the ageing brain.",

Autophagy, a conserved lysosomal, self-destructive process involved in protein and organelle degradation, plays an essential role in both cellular and whole-animal homeostasis. Accumulating evidence now indicates that autophagic degradation declines with age and this gradual reduction of autophagy might have a causative role in the functional deterioration of biological systems during ageing. Indeed, loss of autophagy gene function significantly influences longevity. Moreover, genetic or pharmacological manipulations that extend lifespan in model organisms often activate autophagy. Interestingly, conserved signalling pathways and environmental factors that regulate ageing, such as the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway and oxidative stress response pathways converge on autophagy. In this article, we survey recent findings in invertebrates that contribute to advance our understanding of the molecular links between autophagy and the regulation of ageing.

     "abstract": "The deterioration of skeletal muscle that develops slowly with age, termed sarcopenia, often leads to disability and mortality in the elderly population. As the proportion of elderly citizens continues to increase due to the dramatic rise in life expectancy, there are rising concerns about the healthcare cost and social burden of caring for geriatric patients. Thus, there is a growing need to understand the underlying mechanisms of sarcopenic muscle loss so that more efficacious therapies may be developed. Building evidence suggests that the onset of age-related muscle loss is linked to the age-related changes in gene expression that occur during sarcopenia. In recent work, the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNA (miRNA) involved in the turnover and translation of mRNA were shown as key players believed to be involved in the induction of muscle wasting. Furthermore, posttranscriptional regulation may also be linked to the reduced ability of muscle satellite cells to contribute to muscle mass during ageing, a key contributing factor to sarcopenic progression. Here we highlight how the activation of pathways such as the p38 MAPK and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways alter the ability of RBPs to regulate the expression of their target mRNAs encoding proteins involved in cell cycle (p21 and p16), as well as myogenesis (Pax7, myogenin and MyoD). Further investigation into the role of RBPs and miRNA during sarcopenia may provide new insights into the development and progression of this disorder, which may lead to the development of new treatment options for elderly patients suffering from sarcopenia.",

The main dysfunctions include appearance of enlarged hepatocytes, impaired liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH), development of hepatic steatosis, reduction of secretion of proteins and alterations in the hepatic sinusoid. RNA binding proteins are involved in the regulation of gene expression in all tissues including regulation of biological processes in the liver. This review is focused on the role of a conserved, multi-functional RNA-binding protein, CUGBP1, in the development of aging phenotype in the liver. CUGBP1 has been identified as a protein which binds to RNA CUG repeats expanded in Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM1). CUGBP1 is highly expressed in the liver and regulates translation of proteins which are critical for maintenance of liver functions. In livers of young mice, CUGBP1 forms complexes with eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2 and supports translation of C/EBP\u03b2 and HDAC1 proteins, which are involved in liver growth, differentiation and liver cancer. Aging changes several signaling pathways which lead to the elevation of the CUGBP1\u2013eIF2\u03b1 complex and to an increase of translation of C/EBP\u03b2 and HDAC1. These proteins form multi-protein complexes with additional transcription factors and with chromatin remodeling proteins causing epigenetic alterations of gene expression in livers of old mice. It appears that CUGBP1-mediated translational elevation of HDAC1 is one of the key events in the epigenetic changes in livers of old mice, leading to the development of age-associated dysfunctions of the liver. This review will also discuss a possible role of CUGBP1 in liver dysfunction in patients affected with DM1.",

Developing the wide range of cellular features characteristic of these conditions requires profound alterations in global gene expression patterns, which can be achieved by suppressing, activating, or uncoupling cellular gene regulatory pathways.

As such, cellular factors that recognize and control the decay of ARE-containing mRNAs can influence tumorigenic or senescent phenotypes mediated by products of these transcripts.

The genome of Homo sapiens has evolved to support the svelte phenotype of an endurance runner, setting him/her apart from all other primates. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the competitive advantages conferred by exercise capacity in youth can also provide a survival benefit beyond the reproductive period. These mechanisms include up-regulation of genes encoding proteins involved in protecting cells against oxidative stress, disposing of damaged proteins and organelles, and enhancing bioenergetics. Particularly fascinating are the signaling mechanisms by which endurance running changes the structure and functional capabilities of the brain and, conversely, the mechanisms by which the brain integrates metabolic, cardiovascular and behavioral responses to exercise.

Importantly, mechanical loading and exercise are capable of increasing bone size via periosteal expansion, which by far, is the most effective means of strengthening the structure of a given bone. The focus of this review was to therefore explore whether exercise has the potential to increase periosteal modeling and bone size in the senescent skeleton. A survey of exercise trials in humans suggests that exercise interventions that enhance periosteal modeling in the young skeleton fail to do the same in the elderly skeleton. Underlying this ineffectiveness, in vitro studies indicate that aging lowers basal levels of cell function and degrades bone mechanotransduction at a variety of levels from altered second messenger signaling to gene expression driving proliferation and/or differentiation. Given these age-related alterations, the ultimate efficacy of an exercise intervention may depend upon concurrent supplementation that directly address deficits in signaling and/or cell function. In this context, in vivo animal models of mechanical loading that simulate the muted periosteal adaptation in the elderly hold potential to examine the efficacy of countermeasures. Preliminary in vivo experiments suggest that pharmacologically counteracting age-related deficits in cellular function can restore exercise induced periosteal modeling in the senescent skeleton to levels observed in young animals. If the safety and efficacy of this strategy were to be confirmed for human use, it would enable the utilization of exercise as a viable countermeasure against skeletal fragility at senescence.",

Exercise training is an ideal intervention to counteract the effects of aging and obesity. The 18 randomized controlled trials of exercise studies with or without diet components reviewed here indicate that 3\u201318 month programs that included aerobic and strengthening exercise (2\u20133 days per week) with caloric restriction (typically 750\u00a0kcal deficit/day), induced the greatest change in functional performance measures compared with exercise or diet alone. Importantly, resistance exercise attenuates muscle mass loss with the interventions. These interventions can also combat factors that invoke sarcopenia, including inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance. Therefore, regular multimodal exercise coupled with diet appears to be very effective for counteracting sarocpenic obesity and improving mobility and function in the older, obese adult.",

     "abstract": "Aging is associated with decline in muscle mass and muscle functions. Muscle strength declines disproportionate to the decline in muscle mass indicating that muscle quality or protein quality also declines with age. Human studies have shown a progressive decline in muscle protein synthesis including proteins in the contractile apparatus and mitochondria with age. However, the decline in muscle protein synthesis is disproportionate to the decline in muscle mass that occurs with age prompting to hypothesize that muscle protein degradation also declines with age. A decline in mitochondrial capacity to synthesize ATP is likely a limiting factor of both synthesis and degradation, which are ATP dependent processes. In support of the above hypothesis, several studies have shown a decline in whole body protein turnover (synthesis and degradation). The timely and efficient degradation of irreversibly damaged or modified proteins is critical to maintain the quality of protein. It is proposed that a failure to degrade the damaged proteins and replacing them with newly synthesized proteins contribute to age related decline in muscle mass and quality of muscle proteins. The underlying molecular mechanism of these age related changes in human muscle needs further investigation.",

     "abstract": "During aging there is an increasing imbalance of energy intake and expenditure resulting in obesity, frailty, and metabolic disorders. For decades, research has shown that caloric restriction (CR) and exercise can postpone detrimental aspects of aging. These two interventions invoke a similar physiological signature involving pathways associated with stress responses and mitochondrial homeostasis. Nonetheless, CR is able to delay aging processes that result in an increase of both mean and maximum lifespan, whereas exercise primarily increases healthspan. Due to the strict dietary regime necessary to achieve the beneficial effects of CR, most studies to date have focused on rodents and non-human primates. As a consequence, there is vast interest in the development of compounds such as resveratrol, metformin and rapamycin that would activate the same metabolic- and stress-response pathways induced by these interventions without actually restricting caloric intake. Therefore the scope of this review is to (i) describe the benefits of CR and exercise in healthy individuals, (ii) discuss the role of these interventions in the diseased state, and (iii) examine some of the promising pharmacological alternatives such as CR- and exercise-mimetics.",

Just as adversity early in life can accelerate age-related synaptic impairments, enhancement of neuronal metabolism and function in the developing brain could potentially protect neurons against the synaptic consequences of aging. In this regard, metabolic enhancements following exercise directly oppose the deleterious consequences of adverse stress. In this review, we examine the relationship between exercise and other forms of stress over the lifespan. Exercise is a specialized form of stress in that it is predictable and voluntary, while other forms of psychological and physiological stress are unpredictable and uncontrollable, with distinct consequences for behavior and synaptic plasticity. Themes emerging from the literature surrounding the opposing effects of adversity and exercise include epigenetic mechanisms that converge on the regulation of neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis. These data suggest that exercise-induced neuroprotection and neuronal endangerment following adversity may both be transferable across generations, in a manner that has the potential to impact neuroplasticity over the lifespan.",

Regular exercise has been associated with enhanced vaccination responses, lower numbers of exhausted/senescent T-cells, increased T-cell proliferative capacity, lower circulatory levels of inflammatory cytokines (\u201cinflamm-aging\u201d), increased neutrophil phagocytic activity, lowered inflammatory response to bacterial challenge, greater NK-cell cytotoxic activity and longer leukocyte telomere lengths in aging humans, all of which indicate that habitual exercise is capable of regulating the immune system and delaying the onset of immunosenescence. This contention is supported by the majority of animal studies that report improved immune responses and outcomes to viral infections and malignancies due to exercise training. However, whether or not exercise can reverse, as well as prevent, immunosenescence is a contentious issue, particularly because most longitudinal exercise training studies do not report the same positive effects of exercise on immunity that have been widely reported in studies with a cross-sectional design.

Findings suggest a decline in social cognition with normal ageing, a decline that is at least partially independent of a more general cognitive or executive decline.

Increased body weight and adipose tissue accumulation amplifies the risk of developing various age\u2013related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, musculoskeletal disorders, respiratory diseases and certain types of cancer. This imbalance in body composition and body weight is now recognized as a state of increased oxidative stress and inflammation for the organism.Increasing oxidative stress and inflammation affect telomeres. Telomeres are specialized DNA-protein structures found at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and serve as markers of biological aging rate. They also play a critical role in maintaining genomic integrity and are involved in age-related metabolic dysfunction. Erosion of telomeres is hazardous to healthy cells, as it is a known mechanism of premature cellular senescence and loss of longevity. The association of telomeres and oxidative stress is evident in cultured somatic cells in vitro, where oxidative stress enhances the process of erosion with each cycle of replication.Shorter telomeres have been associated with increasing body mass index, increased adiposity, and more recently with increasing waist to hip ratio and visceral excess fat accumulation. Furthermore, many of the metabolic imbalances of obesity (e.g. glycemic, lipidemic, etc.) give rise to organ dysfunction in a way that resembles the accelerated aging process.This article is a non-systematic review of the evidence linking obesity and accelerated aging processes as they are regulated by telomeres.",

AMPK signaling is involved in the regulation of all these characteristics via an integrated signaling network. Many studies with lower organisms have revealed that increased AMPK activity can extend the lifespan. Experiments in mammals have demonstrated that AMPK controls autophagy through mTOR and ULK1 signaling which augment the quality of cellular housekeeping. Moreover, AMPK-induced stimulation of FoxO/DAF-16, Nrf2/SKN-1, and SIRT1 signaling pathways improves cellular stress resistance. Furthermore, inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling by AMPK suppresses inflammatory responses. Emerging studies indicate that the responsiveness of AMPK signaling clearly declines with aging. The loss of sensitivity of AMPK activation to cellular stress impairs metabolic regulation, increases oxidative stress and reduces autophagic clearance. These age-related changes activate innate immunity defence, triggering a low-grade inflammation and metabolic disorders. We will review in detail the signaling pathways of this integrated network through which AMPK controls energy metabolism, autophagic degradation and stress resistance and ultimately the aging process.",

Indeed mitochondria probably act as net consumers rather than producers of RS. Here we propose that (1) if mitochondria are antioxidant systems, the greater mitochondrial mass in athletic species, such as birds, is advantageous as it should provide a substantial sink for RS. (2) The intense drive for aerobic performance and decreased body density to facilitate flight may explain the relative insensitivity of birds to insulin, as well as depressed insulin levels and apparent sensitization to glucagon. Glucagon also associates with the sirtuin protein family, most of which are associated with caloric restriction regulated pathways, mitochondrial biogenesis and life span extension. (3) We note that telomeres, which appear to be unusually long in birds, bind Sirtuins 2 and 4 and therefore may stabilize and protect nuclear DNA.

This paper provides a meta-analysis of laboratory experiments that have evaluated the effects of DR on lifespan in rats and mice (1934\u2013present). In rats, DR increased median lifespan by 14\u201345% in half of all experiments, but in mice the effects of DR have been much weaker (4\u201327%). The least favorable effects of DR on lifespan have been observed among inbred rather than non-inbred mouse strains. In fact, some inbred mouse strains do not necessarily live longer with DR, including DBA/2 male mice and several strains from the ILSXISS recombinant inbred panel. Shortening of lifespan with DR has also been observed and confirmed for ILSXISS strain 114. Importantly, all rodent studies may be biased by the effects of laboratory breeding, since one study has shown that median lifespan is not improved by DR in wild-derived mice. These findings suggest that the set of genetic backgrounds studied in rodent DR experiments should be diversified. This will broaden the scope of genotypes studied in aging research, but may also be critical for translation of findings from rodents to historically outbred and genetically heterogeneous primate species.",

     "abstract": "The Gadd45 proteins have been intensively studied, in view of their important role in key cellular processes. Indeed, the Gadd45 proteins stand at the crossroad of the cell fates by controlling the balance between cell (DNA) repair, eliminating (apoptosis) or preventing the expansion of potentially dangerous cells (cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence), and maintaining the stem cell pool. However, the biogerontological aspects have not thus far received sufficient attention. Here we analyzed the pathways and modes of action by which Gadd45 members are involved in aging, longevity and age-related diseases. Because of their pleiotropic action, a decreased inducibility of Gadd45 members may have far-reaching consequences including genome instability, accumulation of DNA damage, and disorders in cellular homeostasis \u2013 all of which may eventually contribute to the aging process and age-related disorders (promotion of tumorigenesis, immune disorders, insulin resistance and reduced responsiveness to stress). Most recently, the dGadd45 gene has been identified as a longevity regulator in Drosophila. Although further wide-scale research is warranted, it is becoming increasingly clear that Gadd45s are highly relevant to aging, age-related diseases (ARDs) and to the control of life span, suggesting them as potential therapeutic targets in ARDs and pro-longevity interventions.",

An evaluation framework was employed articulating quality indicators for the psychometric properties of measures, based on their development and use within research studies.Five measures were identified: the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Test (ADKT, Dieckmann et al., 1988); the University of Alabama Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Test for Health Professionals (UAB-ADKT, Barrett et al., 1997); the Dementia Quiz (DQ, Gilleard and Groom, 1994); the Knowledge of Aging and Memory Loss and Care (KAML-C, Kuhn et al., 2005) and the Alzheimer's Disease Knowledge Scale (ADKS, Carpenter et al., 2009). All measures followed a standard scale development process, generally with acceptable reliability and validity. Many studies used measures on populations beyond the target sample, without re-establishing the psychometric properties of the scales.There are limitations with all the measures, including weaknesses in psychometric properties, being outdated and having limited scope. Although the ADKT was once suited to international use and has established psychometric properties, some items are now outdated. The ADKS positions itself as an updated version of the ADKT, yet has not been used beyond the original development study. The DQ is most the suitable for family carers. All measures require periodic updates, to keep pace with the expanding field of dementia. More robust, contemporary measures of knowledge are required.",

     "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in dementia, previously denominated as behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, are often more distressing, impairing, and costly than cognitive symptoms, representing a major health burden for older adults. These symptoms are common features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and are one of the major risk factors for institutionalization. There is a high prevalence of neuropsychiatric disturbances in patients with AD, including depression, anxiety, apathy, psychosis, aggression, and agitation. At present, the role of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes in the development of NPS or neuropsychiatric syndromes/endophenotypes in AD patients is unclear. In this article, we summarized the findings of the studies of NPS and neuropsychiatric syndromes in AD in relation to APOE genotypes, with special attention to the possible underlying mechanisms. While some studies failed to find a significant association between the APOE polymorphism and NPS in late-onset AD, other studies reported a significant association between the APOE \u025b4 allele and an increase in agitation/aggression, hallucinations, delusions, and late-life depression or anxiety. However, current cumulative evidence coming from the few existing longitudinal studies shows no association of APOE genotypes with NPS as a whole in AD. Some negative studies that focused on the distribution of APOE genotypes between AD patients with or without NPS further emphasized the importance of sub-grouping NPS in distinct neuropsychiatric syndromes. Explanations for the variable findings in the existing studies included differences in patient populations, differences in the assessment of neuropsychiatric symptomatology, possible lack of statistical power to detect associations in the negative studies, and small sample sizes generating false positives that cannot be consistently replicated. Finally, many reviewed studies were cross-sectional, whereas it would be of paramount importance to evaluate the risk for incident NPS in relation to the APOE genotype in prospectively followed cohorts of AD patients. In fact, identifying predisposing genetic risk factors may allow us to understand the pathophysiological features of neuropsychiatric syndromes or symptoms in AD, so optimizing possible therapeutic options.",

It is predicted to occur in everyone although does not necessarily lead to dementia. The pathological process is initiated in relation to a senescence mediated functional down-regulation in the posteromedial cortex (Initiation Phase). This leads to a loss of glutamatergic excitatory input to layer II entorhinal cortex neurons. A human specific maladaptive neuroplastic response is initiated in these neurons leading to neuronal dysfunction, NFT formation and death. This leads to further loss of glutamatergic excitatory input and propagation of the maladaptive response along excitatory pathways linking evolutionary progressed vulnerable neurons (Propagation Phase). Eventually neurons are affected in many brain areas resulting in dementia. Possible therapeutic approaches include enhancing glutamatergic transmission. The theory may have implications with regards to how Alzheimer's disease is classified.",

In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of age-related behavioral differences and changes in brain structure throughout the spatial domain. Although spatial cognition is critically important to everyday life, few studies have examined the relationship between this cognitive function and neural changes in the aged brain. Thus, spatial cognition is considered a key area in which the cognitive neuroscience of aging may expand in the near future. The first section of this review examines the methodologies and studies used to assess differences in spatial cognition during normal cognitive aging in animals and humans. We then relate how each domain of spatial cognition (e.g., visuospatial perception, mental imagery, memory and navigation) is affected by the aging process, and discuss possible links with changes in neural mechanisms. Lastly, we address putative links among the age-related deterioration patterns of the various spatial domains and make suggestions for future research.",

In addition to their antioxidant activity, T3 at micromolar concentrations exert cholesterol-lowering activities in cells, animal models and some, but not all, human studies by means of inhibition of the activity of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. At lower concentrations (\u223c10\u00a0nmol/L), T3 modulate signalling pathways involved in neuronal cell death in cell culture experiments. Targets of T3 include prenyl transferases, non-receptor tyrosine kinase, phospholipase A2, 12-lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase-2, and nuclear factor \u03baB. The low bioavailability and rapid excretion of T3 represents a major hurdle in their preventive use. Fasting plasma concentrations, even after supplementation with high doses, are below 1\u00a0\u03bcmol/L. T3 bioavailability may be enhanced by ingestion with a high-fat meal, self-emulsifying drug delivery systems, or phytochemicals that inhibit T3 metabolism and excretion. T3 have no known adverse effects when consumed as part of a normal diet and the studies reviewed here support the notion that they may have potential as neuroprotective agents. However, experiments in relevant animal models and randomised human intervention trials addressing the neuroprotection mediated by T3 are scarce and, thus, highly warranted.",

It is proposed that the accumulation of modifications to such long-lived proteins over a period of decades alters the properties of the organs and tissues in which they reside. Such insidious processes may affect human health, fitness and ultimately may limit our lifespan. The human lens, which contains proteins that do not turnover, is used to illustrate the impact of these gradual deleterious modifications. On the basis of data derived from the lens, it is postulated that the intrinsic instability of certain amino acid residues, which leads to truncation, racemisation and deamidation, is primarily responsible for the age-related deterioration of such proteins. Since these post-translational modifications accumulate over a period of many years, they can only be studied using organisms that have lifespans measured in decades. One conclusion is that there may be important aspects of human aging that can be studied only using long-lived animals.",

Recent experimental studies clearly indicate that environmental fluctuations can induce specific and predictable epigenetic-related molecular changes, and support the possibility of adaptive epigenetic phenomenon. The epigenetic adaptation processes implying alterations of gene expression to buffer the organism against environmental changes support adaptability to the expected life-course conditions. It appears likely that adaptive epigenetic rearrangements can occur not only during early developmental stages but also through the adulthood, and they can cause hormesis, a phenomenon in which adaptive responses to low doses of otherwise harmful conditions improve the functional ability of cells and organisms.

     "abstract": "Studies of neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs) are drawing more attention of researchers worldwide due to the high incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathophysiology of such disorders is, in part, characterized by the transition of a wild-type peptide from its native conformation into a very stable pathological isoform. Subsequently, these abnormal proteins form aggregates of amyloid fibrils that continuously increase in size. Changes in the metabolic processes of neurons (e.g. oxidative stress, hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein, and resulting secondary changes in the cell metabolism) ultimately lead to cell death. We hypothesize that extracellular deposition of \u03b2-amyloid peptide fibrils and neurofibrillary tangles represents the body's adaptation mechanism, aimed at preservation of autonomic functioning; while the cognitive decline is severe, the rest of the organ systems remain unaffected and continue to function. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that destruction of pathological plaques, fibrils, and tangles and the use of vaccines targeting \u03b2-amyloid result in undesirable side effects. To gain a better understanding of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and to develop novel therapies, continued studies of the sporadic form of disease and the mechanisms triggering conformational changes in \u03b2-amyloid peptide fragments are essential. This review is focused on studies investigating the formation of amyloid fibrils and their role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we discuss a related disorder \u2013 amyloidosis \u2013 where formation of fibrils, tangles, and plaques leads to neuronal death which may occur as a result of a failed adaptation process. Further in-depth investigation and comprehensive analysis of alterations in the metabolism of APP, \u03b2-amyloid, and tau protein, which have a pathological effect on cell membrane, alter phosphate exchange, and impair other key metabolic functions of the cell long before the characteristic amyloid deposition takes place, is warranted. A better understanding of intraneuronal processes is crucial in identifying specific inhibitors of pathologic neuronal processes and, consequently, will allow for targeted therapy, thus maximizing efficacy of selected therapeutic regimens.",

Although the mechanisms of aging are not yet fully understood, inflammation, oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, functional alterations in specific neuronal circuits and a restricted degree of apoptosis are involved. Physical exercise improves the efficiency of the capillary system and increases the oxygen supply to the brain, thus enhancing metabolic activity and oxygen intake in neurons, and increases neurotrophin levels and resistance to stress. Regular exercise and an active lifestyle during adulthood have been associated with reduced risk and protective effects for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Similarly, studies in animal models show that physical activity has positive physiological and cognitive effects that correlate with changes in transcriptional profiles. According to numerous studies, epigenetic events that include changes in DNA methylation patterns, histone modification and alterations in microRNA profiles seem to be a signature of aging. Hence, insight into the epigenetic mechanisms involved in the aging process and their modulation through lifestyle interventions such as physical exercise might open new avenues for the development of preventive and therapeutic strategies to treat aging-related diseases.",

Online interventions increasingly target lifestyle risk factors to promote healthy aging. The objective of this systematic review is to evaluate whether Internet mediated lifestyle interventions can successfully change lifestyle in people aged 50 and older. A PubMed search was conducted resulting in twelve articles, based on ten studies. The studies focused on physical activity, weight loss, nutrition, and diabetes. Nine studies used feasible interventions, with an average small to moderate effect size. The most important result is that there are multiple studies reporting positive lifestyle changes in an older population. On average, complex interventions, whether they present tailored or generic information, and online or offline comparison, are more effective than interventions with only one component. Internet mediated interventions hold great potential in implementing effective lifestyle programs, capable of reaching large populations of older persons at very low costs.",

     "abstract": "Research carried out up to 3 decades ago by Gracy and co-workers revealed that the activity of the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase (TPI), which converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), gradually declines whilst carrying out its catalytic function, primarily due to deamidation of certain asparagine residues. It is suggested here that excessive or continuous glycolysis increases TPI deamidation and thereby lowers TPI activity and causes accumulation of its substrate, DHAP, which in turn decomposes into methylglyoxal (MG), a well-recognised reactive bicarbonyl whose actions in cells and tissues, as well as at the whole organism level, mimic much age-relate dysfunction. The proposal helps to explain why suppression of glycolysis by caloric restriction, fasting and increased aerobic activity also suppresses generation of altered proteins which characterise the aged phenotype. It is proposed that these effects on TPI activity, though seemingly neglected in biogerontological contexts, reveal a mechanistic link between energy metabolism and age-related proteostatic dysfunction.",

This special issue of Ageing Research Reviews focuses on advances in research on the immunology of human ageing. Herein are nine articles about the age-related alterations in both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, and about continuing hurdles in vaccinology. These articles point to a common theme that the immunological milieu in old age is substantially different from that seen in the young.

There is no major effect on the numbers and phenotype of DC subsets in aged subjects; nevertheless, their capacity to phagocytose antigens and migrate is impaired with age. There is aberrant cytokine secretion by various DC subsets with CDCs secreting increased basal level of pro-inflammatory cytokines but the response on stimulation to foreign antigens is decreased. In contrast, the response to self-antigens is increased suggesting erosion of peripheral self tolerance. PDC subset also secretes reduced IFN-\u03b1 in response to viruses. The capacity of DCs to prime T cell responses is also affected. Aging thus has a profound affect on DC functions.

In general, these studies show that human TLR function is impaired in the context of aging, and in addition there is evidence for inappropriate persistence of TLR activation in specific systems.

     "abstract": "Immunosenescence comprises a set of dynamic changes occurring to both, the innate as well as the adaptive immune system that accompany human aging and result in complex manifestations of still poorly defined deficiencies in the elderly population. One of the most prominent alterations during aging is the continuous involution of the thymus gland which is almost complete by the age of 50. Consequently, the output of na\u00efve T cells is greatly diminished in elderly individuals which puts pressure on homeostatic forces to maintain a steady T cell pool for most of adulthood. In a great proportion of the human population, this fragile balance is challenged by persistent viral infections, especially Cytomegalovirus (CMV), that oblige certain T cell clones to monoclonally expand repeatedly over a lifetime which then occupy space within the T cell pool. Eventually, these inflated memory T cell clones become exhausted and their extensive accumulation accelerates the age-dependent decline of the diversity of the T cell pool. As a consequence, infectious diseases are more frequent and severe in elderly persons and immunological protection following vaccination is reduced. This review therefore aims to shed light on how various types of persistent viral infections, especially CMV, influence the aging of the immune system and highlight potential measures to prevent the age-related decline in immune function.",

Influenza infection is associated with high rates of complicated illness including pneumonia, heart attacks and strokes in the 65+ population. Changes in both innate and adaptive immune function not only converge in the reduced response to vaccination and protection against influenza, but present significant challenges to new vaccine development. In older adults, the goal of vaccination is more realistically targeted to providing clinical protection against disease rather sterilizing immunity. Correlates of clinical protection may not be measured using standard techniques such as antibody titres to predict vaccine efficacy. Further, antibody responses to vaccination as a correlate of protection may fail to detect important changes in cellular immunity and enhanced vaccine-mediated protection against influenza illness in older people. This article will discuss the impact of influenza in older adults, immunologic targets for improved efficacy of the vaccines, and alternative correlates of clinical protection against influenza that are needed for more effective translation of novel vaccination strategies to improved protection against influenza in older adults.",

A progressive deterioration in the ability of cells to preserve the stability of their proteome occurs with age and contributes to the functional loss characteristic of old organisms. Molecular chaperones and the proteolytic systems are responsible for this cellular quality control by assuring continuous renewal of intracellular proteins. When protein damage occurs, such as during cellular stress, the coordinated action of these cellular surveillance systems allows detection and repair of the damaged structures or, in many instances, leads to the complete elimination of the altered proteins from inside cells. Dysfunction of the quality control mechanisms and intracellular accumulation of abnormal proteins in the form of protein inclusions and aggregates occur in almost all tissues of an aged organism. Preservation or enhancement of the activity of these surveillance systems until late in life improves their resistance to stress and is sufficient to slow down aging.

Mitochondrial function requires the coordinated expression of hundreds of nuclear genes and a few dozen mitochondrial genes, many of which have been associated with either extended or shortened life span. Impaired mitochondrial function resulting from mtDNA and nuclear DNA variation is likely to contribute to an imbalance in cellular energy homeostasis, increased vulnerability to oxidative stress, and an increased rate of cellular senescence and aging. The complex genetic architecture of mitochondria suggests that there may be an equally complex set of gene interactions (epistases) involving genetic variation in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. Results from Drosophila suggest that the effects of mtDNA haplotypes on longevity vary among different nuclear allelic backgrounds, which could account for the inconsistent associations that have been observed between mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups and survival in humans. A diversity of pathways may influence the way mitochondria and nuclear\u2013mitochondrial interactions modulate longevity, including: oxidative phosphorylation; mitochondrial uncoupling; antioxidant defenses; mitochondrial fission and fusion; and sirtuin regulation of mitochondrial genes. We hypothesize that aging and longevity, as complex traits having a significant genetic component, are likely to be controlled by nuclear gene variants interacting with both inherited and somatic mtDNA variability.",

At the same time, increasing clinical and experimental evidence has driven attention towards the pivotal role of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) in bone remodeling. Bone remodeling is thought to be partially controlled by the hypothalamus, a process which is mediated by the adrenergic nerves and neurotransmitters. Currently, new knowledge about the role of the SNS in the development and pathophysiology of osteoporosis is being generated. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence that proves the involvement of the SNS in bone metabolism and to outline some common osteoporotic diseases that occur under different circumstances. The adrenergic signaling pathway and its neurotransmitters are involved to various degrees of importance in the development of osteoporosis in postmenopause, as well as in spinal cord injury, depression, unloading and the complex regional pain syndrome. In addition, clinical and pharmacological studies have helped to increase the comprehension of the adrenergic signaling pathway. We try to individually examine the contributions of the SNS in osteoporotic diseases from a different perspective. It is our hope that a further understanding of the adrenergic signaling by the SNS will pave the way for conceptualizing optimal treatment regimens for osteoporosis in the near future.",

For each hypothesis, we discuss the potential implications. We conclude that the most promising theory is based on an acceleration of the telomere attrition rate due to cardiovascular aging related factors, possibly complemented by telomere mediated hematopoietic senescence.",

Clinical decision rules (CDRs) have been developed and implemented for VTE. Yet, until now, no study has evaluated the existing evidence of the diagnostic accuracy of CDRs for VTE in elderly.To assess the effect of increasing age on diagnostic accuracy of CDRs for VTE in elderly.A computerized systematic search was performed in Medline and Embase from 1950 to 2010. After checking reference lists and field experts, all key journals were hand searched.After review of 1538 eligible citations, nine articles were included and critically appraised on methodological quality by two reviewers using the QUADAS criteria.Data on age subgroups, type of CDRs, sensitivity, specificity, safety, efficiency and the prevalence of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) were extracted.Although sensitivity and safety of the CDRs for VTE in elderly remained high, the specificity and efficiency decreased substantially in older age groups.A limited number of studies met our inclusion criteria. Possible referral bias due to inclusion of relatively high risk elderly patients.This diagnostic review demonstrates an increase of prevalence of PE with age and a strong decrease of specificity and efficiency for CDRs of VTE in older patients. Moreover, due to referral bias the decrease in specificity in the elderly may even be underestimated. Although the safety of CDRs for VTE is high, adapting these rules for elderly is much needed to make them more efficient for aged patients.",

     "abstract": "Skeletal muscle regeneration is a coordinate process in which several factors are sequentially activated to maintain and preserve muscle structure and function.The major role in the growth, remodeling and regeneration is played by satellite cells, a quiescent population of myogenic cells that reside between the basal lamina and plasmalemma and are rapidly activated in response to appropriate stimuli.However, in several muscle conditions, including aging, the capacity of skeletal muscle to sustain an efficient regenerative pathway is severely compromised. Nevertheless, if skeletal muscle possesses a stem cell compartment it is not clear why the muscle fails to regenerate under pathological conditions. Either the resident muscle stem cells are too rare or intrinsically incapable of repairing major damage, or perhaps the injured/pathological muscle is a prohibitive environment for stem cell activation and function. Although we lack definitive answers, recent experimental evidences suggest that the mere presence of endogenous stem cells may not be sufficient to guarantee muscle regeneration, and that the presence of appropriate stimuli and factors are necessary to provide a permissive environment that permits stem cell mediated muscle regeneration and repair.In this review we discuss the molecular basis of muscle regeneration and how aging impacts stem cell mediated muscle regeneration and repair.",

The morphological and functional features of incomplete regeneration and reinnervation are compared between adult and aged animals. In addition, some possible mechanisms of the age-related defects will be discussed. Increased fragmentation or damage in individual components of the NMJ (terminal Schwann cells (TSCs), axon terminals and acetylcholine receptor sites occurs during muscle reinnervation following PNS injury in the aged animals. The capacity to produce ultraterminal sprouting or multiple innervation secondary to PNS injury is maintained, but not the capacity to eliminate such anomalous axonal profiles. The frequency and accuracy of reoccupation of the synaptic sites by TSCs and axon terminals are impaired. Thus, despite the capability of extending neural processes, the rate at which regenerating nerve fibers grow, mature and precisely appose the postsynaptic muscle fiber is impaired, resulting in the failure of re-establishment of the normal single motor innervation in the NMJ. A complex set of cellular interactions in the NMJ are known to participate in the neurotrophism and neurotrophism to support growth of the regenerating and sprouting axons and their pathfinding to direct the target muscle fiber. Besides the capability of \u03b1-motoneurons, signaling originating from the TSCs and muscle may be impaired during aging.",

It is a highly polarized cell that must adhere to the bone surface and migrate along it while resorbing, and cytoskeletal reorganization is critical. Podosomes, highly dynamic actin structures, mediate osteoclast motility. Resorbing osteoclasts form a related actin complex, the sealing zone, which provides the boundary for the resorptive microenvironment. Similar to podosomes, the sealing zone rearranges itself to allow continuous resorption while the cell is moving.

Therefore, studying the basic mechanisms underlying structural and functional recovery after brain injury in aged subjects is of considerable clinical interest. Behavioral and cytological analyses of rodents that have undergone experimental injury show that: (a) behaviorally, aged rodents are more severely impaired by ischemia than are young animals, and older rodents also show diminished functional recovery; (b) compared to young animals, aged animals develop a larger infarct area, as well as a necrotic zone characterized by a higher rate of cellular degeneration and a larger number of apoptotic cells; (c) both astrocytes and macrophages are activated strongly and early following stroke in aged rodents; (d) in older animals, the premature, intense cytoproliferative activity following brain injury leads to the precipitous formation of growth-inhibiting scar tissue, a phenomenon amplified by the persistent expression of neurotoxic factors; (e) though the timing is altered, the regenerative capability of the brain is largely preserved in rats, at least into early old age. Whether endogenous neurogenesis contributes to spontaneous recovery after stroke has not yet been established. If neurogenesis from endogenous neuronal stem cells is to be used therapeutically, an individual approach will be required to assess the possible extent of neurogenic response as well as the possibilities to alter this response for functional improvement or prevention of further loss of brain function.",

MT also protects against development of obesity in mice provided a high fat diet as well as diet-induced oxidative stress damage. Abundance of MT is responsive to caloric restriction (CR) and inhibition of the insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) pathway, and elevated MT gene expression has been observed in tissues from fasted and CR-fed mice, long-lived dwarf mice, worms maintained under CR conditions, and long-lived daf-2 mutant worms. The dysregulation of MT in these systems is likely to have tissue-specific effects on aging outcomes.

     "abstract": "Cellular senescence as the state of permanent inhibition of cell proliferation is a tumour-suppressive mechanism. However, due to the associated secretory phenotype senescence can also contribute to cancer and possibly other age-related diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease. There are two major mechanisms of cellular senescence; replicative senescence depends on telomere erosion or dysfunction whilst stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) is telomere-independent and also includes oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). The senescence phenotype is characterised by altered cellular morphology, increased activity for senescence-associated-\u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-GAL), increased formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF) and promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs), permanent DNA damage, chromosomal instability and an inflammatory secretome. Some of these markers have been identified in cells from age-related pathologies. However, to improve our understanding of the contribution of cellular senescence to organismal ageing and age-related disease, it is imperative to define an unequivocal signature of cellular senescence that is functionally connected with normal and pathological ageing. Herein, we describe the processes leading to senescence, and the current biomarkers of cellular senescence, with particular emphasis on the causal role of DNA damage responses involved in the process. We highlight the gaps in our knowledge both of the processes leading to senescence, and the signature of cellular senescence both in vitro and in vivo. A well-defined set of senescence biomarkers for ageing and age-related disease would have a strong impact on the diagnosis, staging and predicted outcomes of age-related disease, providing the basis for a pharmacological intervention to postpone ageing and age-related disease.",

Recent findings regarding the overlapping mechanisms of CR and Tb that benefit longevity are discussed, including changes in body composition, hormone regulation, and gene expression, as well as reductions in low-level inflammation and reactive oxygen species-induced molecular damage. This information is summarized in a model describing how CR and low Tb, both synergistically and independently, increase lifespan. Moreover, the nascent notion that the rate of ageing may be pre-programmed in response to environmental influences at critical periods of early development is also considered. Based on current evidence, it is concluded that low Tb plays an integral role in mediating the effects of CR on health and longevity, and that low Tb may exert independent biological changes that increase lifespan.

However, older patients are more compliant to antiretroviral treatment; they experience a better virologic response, and treatment represents a positive clinical impact.

The health care industry, physicians, pharmacists, nurses and care givers provide and guide the patient's therapy according to individual needs, while the health care system and regulatory authorities build the necessary framework of support and resources.Any realistic and significant enhancement to the elderly patients\u2019 medicines and medication management needs to be addressed by all disciplines and stakeholders involved since the absence of any of the stakeholders in the overall process negatively impacts the achievable enhancement in geriatric drug therapy.",

     "abstract": "A growing body of epidemiological evidence suggested that metabolic syndrome (MetS) and Mets components (impaired glucose tolerance, abdominal or central obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) may be important in the development of age-related cognitive decline (ARCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular dementia, and Alzheimer's disease (AD). These suggestions proposed in these patients the presence of a \u201cmetabolic-cognitive syndrome\u201d, i.e. a MetS plus cognitive impairment of degenerative or vascular origin. This could represent a pathophysiological model in which to study in depth the mechanisms linking MetS and MetS components with dementia, particularly AD, and predementia syndromes (ARCD or MCI), suggesting a possible integrating view of the MetS components and their influence on cognitive decline. In the present article, we discussed the role of these factors in the development of cognitive decline and dementia, including underlying mechanisms, supporting their influence on \u03b2-amyloid peptide metabolism and tau protein hyperphosphorylation, the principal neuropathological hallmarks of AD. In the next future, trials could then be undertaken to determine if modifications of these MetS components including inflammation, another factor probably related to MetS, could lower risk of developing cognitive decline. Future research aimed at identifying mechanisms that underlie comorbid associations of MetS components will not only provide important insights into the causes and interdependencies of predementia and dementia syndromes, but will also inspire novel strategies for treating and preventing cognitive disorders.",

Recently, meta-analysis on this topic have been conducted and found that there was marked heterogeneity between trials. The objective of this systematic review is to have a retrospection of the efficacy of cell therapy and explore whether the study design or characteristics of subjects may have influenced the effects of cell therapy on recovery of left ventricular function after AMI. Trials were identified in ClinicalTrial, mRCT, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and PubMed databases, reviews, and reference lists of relevant papers. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated for net changes in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by using random-effect models. Meta-regression analyses were performed to explore the influence of study characteristics. Ten randomized controlled trials (12 comparisons) with a total of 814 participants were included. In an overall pooled estimate, compared with the control group, BMCs therapy significantly improved the LVEF change from baseline to follow-up (WMD: 3.79%, 95% CI: 2.4\u20135.7%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001; heterogeneity test: I2\u00a0=\u00a082.7%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Recently, the age-related changes in several inflammatory mediators have been implicated in the pathogenesis of sarcopenia. The purposes of this systematic review were two-fold: (1) to describe the patterns of muscle strength loss with age in the general population, and (2) to quantify the loss of muscle strength in rheumatoid arthritis as representative for an underlying inflammatory state. Handgrip strength was used as a proxy for overall muscle strength.Results from 114 studies (involving 90,520 subjects) and 71 studies (involving 10,529 subjects) were combined in a meta-analysis for the general and rheumatoid arthritis population respectively and standardized at an equal sex distribution. For the general population we showed that between the ages of 25 years and 95 years mean handgrip strength declined from 45.5\u00a0kg to 23.2\u00a0kg for males and from 27.1\u00a0kg to 12.8\u00a0kg for females. We noted a steeper handgrip strength decline after 50 years of age (rate of 0.37\u00a0kg/year). In the rheumatoid arthritis population handgrip strength was not associated with chronological age between the ages of 35 years and 65 years and was as low as 20.2\u00a0kg in male and 15.1 in female. Rheumatoid arthritis disease duration was inversely associated with handgrip strength.This meta-analysis shows distinct patterns of age-related decrease of handgrip strength in the general population. Handgrip strength is strongly associated with the presence and duration of an inflammatory state as rheumatoid arthritis. The putative link between age-related inflammation and sarcopenia mandates further study as it represents a potential target for intervention to maintain functional independence in old age.",

     "abstract": "This article proposes that behavioural advancement during mammalian evolution had been in part mediated through extension of total developmental time. Such time extensions would have resulted in increased numbers of neuronal precursor cells, hence larger brains and a disproportionate increase in the neocortex. Larger neocortical areas enabled new connections to be formed during development and hence expansion of existing behavioural circuits. To have been positively selected such behavioural advances would have required enough postdevelopmental time to enable the behaviour to be fully manifest. It is therefore proposed that the success of mammalian evolution depended on initiating a genetic control of total postdevelopmental time. This could have been mediated through the redeployment of gene regulatory networks controlling total developmental time to additionally control total postdevelopmental time. The result would be that any extension of developmental time, leading to a behavioural advancement, would be accompanied by a proportional extension to postdevelopmental time. In effect it is proposed that mammalian lifespan as a whole is genetically controlled.",

Mitochondria accumulate calcium ions (Ca2+) for cellular bioenergetic metabolism and suppression of mitochondrial motility within the cell. Excessive Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria often leads to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and induction of apoptosis. Ca2+ is an interesting second messenger which can initiate both cellular life and death pathways in mitochondria. This review critically discusses the potential of manipulating mitochondrial Ca2+ concentrations as a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating AD. This review also highlights the neuroprotective role of a number of currently available agents that modulate different mitochondrial Ca2+ transport pathways. It is reasoned that these mitochondrial Ca2+ modulators are most effective in combination with agents that increase the Ca2+ buffering capacity of mitochondria. Modulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ handling is a potential pharmacological target for future development of AD treatments.",

     "abstract": "Since a technique was reported for generating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), various groups worldwide have reprogrammed human and mouse somatic cells into iPSCs using a range of techniques and pluripotency genes. Progress in iPSC research has opened up a novel avenue in autologous regenerative medicine, whereby patient-specific pluripotent cells could potentially be derived from adult somatic cells. However, several limitations currently prohibit their use in clinical settings, including the viral DNA delivery system and the exogenous overexpression of pluripotency genes. New strategies are therefore needed to ensure the safe and efficient production of iPSCs, and to guide their differentiation into the desired lineages required to repair damaged tissue and treat disease. Here, we present an overview of recent research into cellular reprogramming. We focus on the feasibility of microRNA-based strategies for reprogramming somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, thus obviating the need to introduce viruses or DNA into donor cells, and therefore ameliorating the risks associated with reprogramming techniques. In light of the critical roles of microRNAs in maintaining the pluripotent state and in regulating cell-lineage specification and epigenetic modifications of chromatin, we also discuss the potential role of microRNAs as candidates for controlled cellular reprogramming and induction of cell fate conversion beyond lineages without reversion to a pluripotent state. Further research into the microRNAs involved in iPSC reprogramming and their potential roles in controlled cellular reprogramming will add another dimension to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular reprogramming.",

     "abstract": "An ability to mount a stress resistance under pressure is a major host defence mechanism and has been a fundamental force during evolution. However, the adaptation capacity clearly declines during aging and this loss of stress resistance accelerates the aging process exposing the organism to degenerative diseases. The effect of stress on organisms seems to be a dose-dependent response, i.e. mild stress induces a stress tolerance and extends the lifespan whereas excessive stress accentuates the aging process. This paradox is known as hormesis in aging research. It is essential to distinguish the intensity of cellular stress and thus mount an appropriate host defence. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contains three branches of stress transducers, i.e. IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 pathways, all of which recognize stress-related disturbances in the function of ER. These transducers trigger a complex signaling network which activates an unfolded protein response (UPR). Interestingly, ER stress transducers can distinguish the intensity of ER stress and induce a dose-dependent UPR, either adaptive response to stress or apoptotic cell death. The efficiency of the stress recognition system and UPR signaling declines during aging. We will discuss the role of ER stress in hormetic regulation of aging process and longevity.",

     "abstract": "The vascular hypothesis of Alzheimer disease (AD), first proposed by us in 1993, provides substantial evidence that suggests vascular risk factors (VRF) play a critical role in the development of cognitive decline and AD during aging. Cardiovascular and carotid artery disease, two major risk factors to AD, can conspire or independently induce chronic brain hypoperfusion (CBH) decades before any symptoms of cognitive impairment are expressed. The pathologic construct linking CBH to cognitive impairment and AD remains unclear but evidence shows that it may provide an opportunity to intervene in the prevention or delay of dementia onset. A preliminary randomized clinical study in cognitively healthy middle age individuals to undergo screening using carotid Doppler ultrasound, echocardiography and ankle-brachial index is proposed. These office tools are non-invasive, cost-effective, easily applied in one session and relatively accurate procedures with no inherent harmful effects. More importantly, ultrasound can help identify asymptomatic patients most likely to develop progressive cognitive decline due to persistent CBH secondary to progressive cardiovascular or carotid artery pathology. When these VRF are detected within the heart or carotid arteries, optimal medical treatment or management may be indicated to prevent or slow down further disease progression that fosters cognitive deterioration generated from such conditions. Secondary screening tools such as neuroimaging, neurocognitive testing and CSF markers may be used to confirm ultrasound findings. Prevention-by-detection of VRF and target treatment, if found effective, could significantly promote healthier mental and physical aging and lessen the socio-economic calamity anticipated from the growing prevalence of dementia.",

A linear mixed model regression was incorporated to examine differences between outcomes, as well as potential study-level predictor variables.Forty-seven studies were included, representing 1079 participants. A positive effect for each of the strength outcomes was determined however there was heterogeneity between studies. Regression revealed that higher intensity training was associated with greater improvement.

The vital importance of PKA signaling to cellular function is reflected in the widespread expression of PKA subunit genes. As one of its many functions, PKA plays a key role in the regulation of metabolism and triglyceride storage. The PKA pathway has become of great interest to the study of aging, since mutations that cause a reduction in PKA signaling have been shown to extend lifespan in yeast, and to both delay the incidence and severity of age-related disease, and to promote leanness and longevity, in mice. There is increasing interest in the potential for the inhibition or redistribution of adiposity to attenuate aging, since obesity is associated with impaired function of most organ systems, and is a strong risk factor for shortened life span. Its association with coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, cancer, sleep apnea and osteoarthritis is leading to its accession as a major cause of global ill health. Therefore, gene signaling pathways such as PKA that promote adiposity are potential inhibitory targets for aging intervention. Since numerous plant compounds have been found that both prevent adipogenesis and inhibit PKA signaling, a focused investigation into their effects on biological systems and the corresponding molecular mechanisms would be of high relevance to the discovery of novel and non-toxic compounds that promote healthy aging.",

Indeed, the main factors influencing ketone bodies utilization by the brain (blood levels, transport mechanisms, catabolic enzymes) undergo developmental changes, although several reports indicate that KDs maintain some efficacy during adulthood and even during advanced aging. Encouraging results obtained in patients affected by age-related neurodegenerative diseases have prompted new interest on KDs\u2019 effect on the aging brain, also considering the poor efficacy of therapies currently used.

It seems that the aging process itself is not genetically programmed but a random process involving the loss of molecular fidelity and subsequent accumulation of waste products. This age-related increase in cellular entropy is compatible with the disposable soma theory of aging. A large array of host defence systems has been linked to the NF-\u03baB system which is an ancient signaling pathway specialized to host defence, e.g. functioning in immune system. Emerging evidence demonstrates that the NF-\u03baB system is activated during aging. Oxidative stress and DNA damage increase with aging and elicit a sustained activation of the NF-\u03baB system which has negative consequences, e.g. chronic inflammatory response, increase in apoptotic resistance, decline in autophagic cleansing, and tissue atrophy, i.e. processes that enhance the aging process. We will discuss the role of NF-\u03baB system in the pro-aging signaling and will emphasize that several longevity factors seem to be inhibitors of NF-\u03baB signaling and in that way they can suppress the NF-\u03baB-driven entropic host defence catastrophe.",

Bioinformatics and software issues plus statistical difficulties in genome-wide studies are discussed, as well as the use of targeted sequencing to decrease costs and facilitate statistical analyses. Lastly, we discuss a number of methods to gather biological insights from massive amounts of data, such as functional enrichment, transcriptional regulation and network analyses. Although in the fast-moving field of NGS new platforms will soon take center stage, the approaches made possible by NGS will be at the basis of molecular biology, genetics and systems biology for years to come, making them instrumental for research on aging.",

Mice and flies can shift readily between the control and CR physiological states, even at older ages. Many health benefits are induced by even brief periods of CR in flies, rodents, monkeys, and humans. In humans and nonhuman primates, CR produces most of the physiologic, hematologic, hormonal, and biochemical changes it produces in other animals. In primates, CR provides protection from type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebral vascular diseases, immunological decline, malignancy, hepatotoxicity, liver fibrosis and failure, sarcopenia, inflammation, and DNA damage. It also enhances muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, affords neuroprotection; and extends mean and maximum lifespan. CR rapidly induces antineoplastic effects in mice. Most claims of lifespan extension in rodents by drugs or nutrients are confounded by CR effects. Transcription factors and co-activators involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism, including SirT1, PGC-1\u03b1, AMPK and TOR may be involved in the lifespan effects of CR. Paradoxically, low body weight in middle aged and elderly humans is associated with increased mortality. Thus, enhancement of human longevity may require pharmaceutical interventions.",

From ancient time, mankind has already interested in preventing and keeping ourselves young. Anti-aging study is certainly not a new research area. Nowadays, the meaning of anti-aging has been changed from simply prolonging lifespan to increasing health span, which emphasizes more on the quality of life. This is the concept of healthy aging and prevention of pathological aging, which is associated with diseases. Keeping our brain functions as in young age is an important task for neuroscientists to prevent aging-associated neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's diseases (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The causes of these diseases are not fully understood, but it is believed that these diseases are affected by multiple factors. Neurodegenerative diseases can be cross-linked with a number of aging-associated conditions. Based on this, a holistic approach in anti-aging research seems to be more reasonable. Herbal medicine has a long history in Asian countries. It is believed that many of the medicinal herbs have anti-aging properties. Recent studies have shown that some medicinal herbs are effective in intervention or prevention of aging-associated neurological disorders. In this review, we use wolfberry and ginseng as examples to elaborate the properties of anti-aging herbs. The characteristics of medicinal herbs, especially their applications in different disease stages (prevention and intervention) and multi-targets properties, allow them to be potential anti-aging intervention in prevention and treatment of the aging-associated neurological disorders.",

Advances in medicine and surgery have increased the average lifespan of classically affected patients. Serious visual and/or musculoskeletal impairment often has detrimental effects on day-to-day activities and quality of life. MFS patients suffer from many problems at younger ages and with higher frequencies than the general population because of the degenerative nature of the genetic condition. In classical MFS, changes are caused by mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene (FBN1). Mutations in the fibrillin-2 gene were discovered in individuals with a phenotypically related disorder, congenital contractural arachnodactyly. Some of the clinical manifestations of MFS cannot be explained by mechanical properties alone. Recently, mutations in the genes required for transforming growth factor-beta signaling (TGFBR1 and TGFBR2) have been found in several disorders with varying degrees of overlap with classical MFS, including Loeys\u2013Dietz syndrome and familial thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections. MFS is a disorder that is variable in its phenotypic expression. Specific information about mutations in the large FBN1 gene will give rise to more information about the phenotype\u2013genotype correlations. Possible molecular mechanisms for the pathogenesis of MFS will be discussed which may assist healthcare professionals to control environmental factors that provoke individual complications in MFS.",

Here, we present a conceptual generalization of those relationships, as suggested by evidence from non-aging microalgae, mainly Euglena. The circadian gating of mitosis and circadian temporal coordination may respectively reduce radiation- and disharmony-induced stress in which homeostasis cannot be involved, whereas circadian resistance rhythms may greatly help homeostatic defense from radiation- and metabolism-induced stress.

They are crucial to the survival of plants and most of the animals that harbour them. An example of a non-photosynthesizing plastid in animals is the apicoplast in the malaria-causing Plasmodium species, which is required for survival of the parasite. Many animals (such as sea slugs, sponges, reef corals, and clams) consume prey containing chloroplasts, or feed on algae. Some of these incorporate the chloroplasts from their food, or whole algal cells, into their own cells. Other species from these groups place algal cells between their own cells. Reef-building corals often lose their intracellular algae as a result of environmental changes, resulting in coral bleaching and death. The sensitivity of the chloroplast internal membranes to temperature stress is one of the reasons for coral death. Chloroplasts can also be a causal factor in the processes leading to whole-plant death, as the knockout of a gene encoding a chloroplast protein delayed the yellowing that proceeds death in tobacco plants. It is concluded that chloroplasts and other plastids are essential to individual survival in many species, including animals, and that they also play a role in triggering death in some plant and animal species.",

Brief episodes of ischemia are able to protect the heart against a following more prolonged ischemic period.

An increasing body of epidemiological evidence suggested that elevated saturated fatty acids (SFA) could have negative effects on age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Furthermore, a clear reduction of risk for cognitive decline has been found in population samples with elevated fish consumption, high intake of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), particularly n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 PUFA. Epidemiological findings demonstrated that high PUFA intake appeared to have borderline non-significant trend for a protective effect against the development of MCI. Several hypotheses could explain the association between dietary unsaturated fatty acids and cognitive functioning, including mechanisms through the co-presence of antioxidant compounds in food groups rich in fatty acids, via atherosclerosis and thrombosis, inflammation, accumulation of b-amyloid, or via an effect in maintaining the structural integrity of neuronal membranes, determining the fluidity of synaptosomal membranes that thereby regulate neuronal transmission. However, recent findings from clinical trials with n\u00a0\u2212\u00a03 PUFA supplementation showed efficacy on depressive symptoms only in non-apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u025b4 carriers, and on cognitive symptoms only in very mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) subgroups, MCI patients, and cognitively unimpaired subjects non-APOE \u025b4 carriers. These data together with epidemiological evidence support a possible role of fatty acid intake in maintaining adequate cognitive functioning and possibly for the prevention and management of cognitive decline and dementia, but not when the AD process has already taken over.",

In biological membranes \u03b1-tocopherol and cytochrome b5, as known, act synergistically to overcome free radical injury and to form lipid-radical cycles. These cycles activate membrane proteins, protect membrane lipids from oxidation and prevent from formation of endogenous aldehydes. Experimental and clinical evidence accumulated for 5\u20136 years suggests that endogenous aldehydes, such as malonic dialdehyde (MDA) and methylglyoxal (MG), are the major initiators of the metabolic disorders. The age-related diseases emerge when cells cannot control formation of aldehydes and/or cannot abolish the negative effect of methylglyoxal on their metabolism. If the efficiency of the glyoxalase system is insufficient toxic aldehydes cause cumulative damage over a lifetime. In this paper, we provide evidence to consider ageing as a process in which lipid-radical cycles gradually substitute for lipid peroxidation. There are always two opposing tendencies or actions which counteract each other \u2013 actions of melatonin, lipid-radical cycles and the glyoxalase system (anti-ageing effect) and negative actions of the toxic aldehydes (pro-ageing effect).

For RMR, this reduction appears to be due to a reduction in organ mass and specific metabolic rates of individual tissues. However, these anatomical changes explain very little regarding the decline in activity EE, which is governed by both genetic and environmental sources. The biological control centers for activity EE are closely coupled with body mass fluctuations and seem to originate in the brain. Several candidate neuromodulators may be involved in the age-related reduction of activity EE that include: orexin, agouti-related proteins and dopaminergic pathways. Unfortunately, the existing body of research has primarily focused on how neuromodulators influence weight gain and only a few studies have been performed in aging models. Recent evidence suggests that activity EE has an important role in dictating lifespan and thus places emphasis on future research to uncover the underlying biological mechanisms. The study of EE continues to unlock clues to aging.",

     "abstract": "The most commonly studied laboratory rodents possess a specialized form of fat called brown adipose tissue (BAT) that generates heat to help maintain body temperature in cold environments. In humans, BAT is abundant during embryonic and early postnatal development, but is absent or present in relatively small amounts in adults where it is located in paracervical and supraclavicular regions. BAT cells can \u2018burn\u2019 fatty acid energy substrates to generate heat because they possess large numbers of mitochondria in which oxidative phosphorylation is uncoupled from ATP production as a result of a transmembrane proton leak mediated by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Studies of rodents in which BAT levels are either increased or decreased have revealed a role for BAT in protection against diet-induced obesity. Data suggest that individuals with low levels of BAT are prone to obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease, whereas those with higher levels of BAT maintain lower body weights and exhibit superior health as they age. BAT levels decrease during aging, and dietary energy restriction increases BAT activity and protects multiple organ systems including the nervous system against age-related dysfunction and degeneration. Future studies in which the effects of specific manipulations of BAT levels and thermogenic activity on disease processes in animal models (diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancers, neurodegenerative diseases) are determined will establish if and how BAT affects the development and progression of age-related diseases. Data from animal studies suggest that BAT and mitochondrial uncoupling can be targeted for interventions to prevent and treat obesity and age-related diseases. Examples include: diet and lifestyle changes; specific regimens of mild intermittent stress; drugs that stimulate BAT formation and activity; induction of brown adipose cell progenitors in muscle and other tissues; and transplantation of brown adipose cells.",

     "abstract": "Following the global trend of population aging, China became an aging society at the end of the 20th century. The ever-growing medical demands of the elderly, the lag in medical insurance policy, and the late development of geriatric services make the present situation of public health in China worrying. To meet these challenges, the Beijing municipal government has actively adjusted its development strategies and has been building up a medical service and healthcare system suitable for the elderly. The core of the system is a three-level management of geriatric diseases: prevention and treatment for chronic diseases, functional rehabilitation, long-term care, and family attendance at rural and urban community health service centers (stations); post-acute rehabilitation, long-term care, and palliative treatment in the specialized geriatric hospitals of every district (county); and rescue and treatment for acute and serious geriatric diseases in the geriatric sections of all general hospitals and Beijing Geriatric Hospital. By raising awareness and gaining support from all of society, the implementation of this system will benefit millions of elderly people and promote the sustainable financial development and social harmony of Beijing.",

     "abstract": "Studies of senile dementia (SD) on the Chinese mainland, done over the decades, have furthered the understanding of its epidemiology, basic and clinical medical aspects, and effects on health economics, to name a few areas. There are 6\u20137 million Chinese people with SD, with an incidence of 5\u20137% of people over 65 years of age. In this group, Alzheimer's accounts for 50\u201360% of SD. The pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has been investigated, and known risk factors include \u03b2-amyloid, formaldehyde, acetyl cholinesterase, inflammation, neuronal dysfunction and death. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an independent risk factor of SD. Comprehensive treatment can improve clinical efficacy, and quality of life can be improved by appropriate and reasonable care and rehabilitation therapy. However, swallowing disorders, infection and systemic failure remain the main causes of death among SD patients. In the Chinese mainland, SD extracts a total annual economic loss of 83.5\u201397.4 billion yuan and is responsible for 51.3\u201359.8 billion yuan in annual healthcare costs. Despite the progress to date, basic research and drug development for SD are needed. Also, a more evidence-based approach to Chinese medicine research would be prudent. Such research results can hopefully provide valuable cues for governmental decision-making and assist in addressing and halting the incidence of SD in China.",

     "abstract": "Falls are a common and serious problem for aged people, causing an enormous amount of morbidity, mortality and burden to both the immediate family and the society in terms of healthcare utilization and costs. In the Chinese mainland, epidemiological data indicates a predilection for single falls, with women more at risk than men. A variety of risk factors such as weakness, unsteady gait, mental confusion and use of certain medications are associated with falls in the elderly. Addressing these risk factors can be expected to reduce rates of falling. Targeted fall risk assessments are the most effective preventive procedures, and include a plethora of assessment instruments that have been developed and designed for different purposes over the decades. Strategies for control of elderly falls have been established differently, taking into account the complex physiological and pathological conditions of the elderly. The optimal approach involves interdisciplinary assessments, physical exercise, medical intervention, environmental inspection and hazard abatement. In China, the 25 million falls suffered annually by the estimated 20 million elderly population exacts direct medical costs of about 5 billion yuan and social costs of 60\u201380 billion yuan. Fall-prevention strategies will thus have profound social and economic benefits.",

     "abstract": "The prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) increase with age, and its diagnosis and treatment in older people present a challenge. Applying evidence to elderly patients can be problematic, because older persons with frailty, multiple comorbidities, and functional disabilities are generally excluded from diabetes clinical trials. Frailty is characterized by multisystem decline and vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. Insulin resistance predicts frailty, and DM accelerates muscle strength loss. Geriatric diabetes care guidelines have refocused from risk factor control to geriatric syndromes. The European Diabetes Working Party guidelines for elderly type 2 DM patients consider frailty, recommending a conservative target (hemoglobin A1c <8%). Diabetic care-home residents with physical disabilities, cognitive impairment, tube feeding, and the inability to communicate pose particular challenges. Tight glycemic control for such patients increases the risk of hypoglycemia and significant functional decline; a mean hemoglobin A1c <7% did not protect them from care-home-acquired pneumonia. In conclusion, caring for elderly diabetic patients poses unique challenges. Little is known about diabetes care of elderly people with frailty, disabilities, or multiple comorbidities. The interrelationship between frailty and DM deserves further investigation. Practice guidelines for care-home residents with DM are needed to ensure quality of care.",

     "abstract": "Taiwan is one of the fastest aging countries in the world. As such, the government has developed various strategies to promote an age-friendly health-care system. Health services are supported by National Health Insurance (NHI), which insures over 97% of citizens and over 99% of health-care institutes. The current health-care system has difficulties in caring for older patients with multiple comorbidities, complex care needs, functional impairments, and post-acute care needs. Taipei, an international metropolis with a well-preserved tradition of filial piety in Chinese societies, has developed various strategies to overcome the aforementioned barriers to an age-friendly health-care system. These include an emphasis on general medical care and a holistic approach in all specialties, development of a geriatrics specialty training program, development of post-acute services, and strengthening of linkages between health and social care services. Despite achievements thus far, challenges still include creating a more extensive integration between medical specialties, promotion of an interdisciplinary care model across specialties and health-care settings, and integration of health and social care services. The experiences of Taipei in developing an age-friendly health-care service system may be a culturally appropriate model for other Chinese and Asian communities.",

     "abstract": "Aging, which affects all organ systems, is one of the most complex phenotypes. Recent discoveries in long-lived mutant mice have revealed molecular mechanisms of longevity in mammals which may contribute to our understanding of why humans age. These mutations include naturally occurring spontaneous mutations, and those of mice genetically modified by modern genomic technologies. It is generally believed that the most fundamental mechanisms of aging are evolutionarily conserved across species. The following types of longevity mechanisms have been intensively studied: suppression of the somatotropic (growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor 1) axis, decreased metabolism and increased resistance of oxidative stress, reduced insulin secretion and increased insulin sensitivity, and delayed reproductive maturation and reduced fertility. In addition, many of the mutations have a sex-dependent effect on lifespan, and when present in different genetic backgrounds, the effects of the same gene mutation can vary considerably. The present review discusses these phenotypic variations as well as describing the known longevity genes in long-lived mutant mice and the molecular mechanisms specifying longevity. We anticipate that these mouse studies will ultimately provide clues about how to delay the aging and prolong lifespan, and help to develop therapies for healthier human aging.",

     "abstract": "Ageing, which all creatures must encounter, is a challenge to every living organism. In the human body, it is estimated that cell division and metabolism occurs exuberantly until about 25 years of age. Beyond this age, subsidiary products of metabolism and cell damage accumulate, and the phenotypes of ageing appear, causing disease formation. Among these age-related diseases, neurodegenerative diseases have drawn a lot of attention due to their irreversibility, lack of effective treatment, and accompanied social and economical burdens. In seeking to ameliorate ageing and age-related diseases, the search for anti-ageing drugs has been of much interest. Numerous studies have shown that the plant polyphenol, resveratrol (3,5,4\u2032-trihydroxystilbene), extends the lifespan of several species, prevents age-related diseases, and possesses anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. The beneficial effects of resveratrol are believed to be associated with the activation of a longevity gene, SirT1. In this review, we discuss the pathogenesis of age-related neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular disease. The therapeutic potential of resveratrol, diet and the roles of stem cell therapy are discussed to provide a better understanding of the ageing mystery.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are intracellular organelles responsible for generating ATP through respiration and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), producing reactive oxygen species, and initiating and executing apoptosis. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed to be an important hallmark of aging and cancer. Because mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is important in maintaining functionally competent organelles, accumulation of mtDNA mutations can affect energy production, oxidative stress, and cell survival, which may contribute to aging and/or carcinogenesis. This review outlines a variety of somatic mtDNA mutations identified in aging tissues and human cancers, as well as recent advances in understanding the causal role of mtDNA mutations in the aging process and cancer progression. Mitochondrial dysfunction elicited by somatic mutations in mtDNA could induce apoptosis in aging cells and some cancer cells with severe mtDNA mutations. In addition, it could activate mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling to modulate the expression of nuclear genes involved in a metabolic shift from OXPHOS to glycolysis, facilitate cells to adapt to altered environments and develop resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, or promote metastatic properties of cancer cells. These findings suggest that accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations is not only an important contributor to human aging but also plays a critical role in cancer progression.",

The ability to regulate multiple targets simultaneously makes miRNA a crucial regulator in many physiological conditions, especially in the aging network and process. The tremendous capability of miRNA supports its ability in regulating ageing, which is a complex process involving multiple interconnected signaling pathways. Even though the relationship between miRNA and ageing is not fully understood, studies have provided evidence showing that miRNAs participate in regulating cell cycle progression, proliferation, stemness gene expression, and stress-induced responses. Molecular studies of ageing and miRNAs would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of ageing and, subsequently, help to ameliorate this universal process compromising our quality of life. In this review article, we focus our attention on miRNA targets in conserved pathways involved in organism aging and aging networks, as well as cellular senescence.",

This article aims to review the data of various case/control association studies that examine the difference in genetic polymorphisms between long-lived people and younger subjects across different human populations. There are more than 100 candidate genes potentially involved in human longevity; this article particularly focuses on genes of the insulin/IGF-1 pathway, FOXO3A, FOXO1A, lipoprotein metabolism (e.g., APOE and PON1), and cell-cycle regulators (e.g., TP53 and P21). Since the confirmed genetic components for human longevity are few to date, further precise assessment of the genetic contributions is required. Gaining a better understanding of the contribution of genetics to human longevity may assist in the design of improved treatment methods for age-related diseases, delay the aging process, and, ultimately, prolong the human lifespan.",
