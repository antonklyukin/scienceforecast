     "abstract": "We aimed to evaluate whether neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) features in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) were of diagnostic value to differentiate untreated essential tremor (ET) from de novo tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease (PDT).Eighteen untreated ET patients, 21 de novo PDT patients and 21 healthy control subjects were recruited. All the subjects underwent clinical examination, motor and cognitive evaluations, as well as NM-MRI. High signal intensity of the lateral, central and medial SNc subregions on NM-MRI were evaluated using the width, signal intensity (contrast-to-noise ratio, CNR) and visual analysis. Diagnostic test performance of SNc values was investigated by using receiver operating characteristic analysis and net reclassification improvement (NRI).The width and CNR values of the lateral and central SNc subregions in PDT were significantly decreased compared with those in ET and control group. Using visual analysis, the total visual score of all SNc subregions was significantly reduced in PDT when compared with ET and control group. The width of the lateral SNc subregion allowed the best differentiation between ET and PDT, and visual analysis also showed good diagnostic value. NRI result indicated that visual analysis and the width of the lateral SNc subregion had the same diagnostic power.The neuromelanin changes of SNc in ET and PDT follow the different patterns. Both the measurements and visual analysis of SNc on NM-MRI provide high diagnostic accuracy for differentiating ET from PDT subtype. NM-MRI is a potential tool in diagnostic work-up of tremor disorders.",

     "abstract": "Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is an inborn error of cholesterol and bile acid metabolism, leading to neuropsychiatric and systemic manifestations. Movement disorders have rarely been reported in CTX, while a detailed appreciation of the full phenotypic spectrum is required in order to prevent underdiagnosis of this disease. This review focuses on the frequency of more unusual, non-ataxia and non-spasticity movement disorders reported in CTX. In total, 39 articles were reviewed, describing 55 CTX patients with a movement disorder. Additionally, we report on seven patients with parkinsonism out of our Dutch cohort of 79 (77 genetically proven) CTX patients. Mean age at onset of the movement disorder was 40\u202f\u00b1\u202f12 years (median 40, range 13\u201362 years). Movement disorders can be considered a late disease manifestation. Parkinsonism was the most frequently reported movement disorder, followed by dystonia, myoclonus and postural tremor. Movement disorders were found to be mixed in 23% of patients and were usually part of a complex clinical picture, rather than a prominent symptom. Still, in 18% of the cases, a movement disorder was the presenting symptom.Unusual movement disorders represent a rare clinical feature in CTX, but CTX should be considered in the differential diagnosis of these movement disorders, particularly in case of early onset, and when associated with other neurological features (especially cognitive impairment, pyramidal and cerebellar signs) and/or with systemic features (such as diarrhoea, cataract and tendon xanthomas). CTX is a treatable disorder, stressing the importance of considering CTX as a potential cause of movement disorders.",

     "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET), one of the most common neurological disorders is typically evaluated with validated rating scales which only provide a subjective assessment during a clinical visit, underestimating the fluctuations tremor during different daily activities. Motion sensors have shown favorable performances in both quantifying tremor and voluntary human activity recognition (HAR).To create an automated system of a reference scale using motion sensors supported by deep learning algorithms to accurately rate ET severity during voluntary activities, and to propose an IOTA based blockchain application to share anonymously tremor data.A smartwatch-based tremor monitoring system was used to collect motion data from 20 subjects while they were doing standard tasks. Two neurologists rated ET by Fahn-Tolosa Marin Tremor Rating Scale (FTMTRS). Supported by deep learning techniques, activity classification models (ACMs) and tremor evaluation models (TEMs) were created and algorithms were implemented, to distinguish voluntary human activities and evaluate tremor severity respectively.A practical application example showed that the proposed ACMs can classify six typical activities with high accuracy (89.73%\u201398.84%) and the results produced by the TEMs are significantly correlated with the FTMTRS ratings of two neurologists (r1\u202f=\u202f0.92, p1\u202f=\u202f0.008; r2\u202f=\u202f0.93, p2\u202f=\u202f0.007).This study demonstrated that motion sensor data, supported by deep learning algorithms, can be used to classify human activities and evaluate essential tremor severity during different activities.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterized by pathological \u03b1-synuclein accumulation and cell death, which has been hypothesized to originate in peripheral nerve terminals and subsequently spread via autonomic nerves. Supporting this, most Parkinson's disease patients experience autonomic non-motor symptoms such as constipation, often years prior to diagnosis.We aimed to study gastrointestinal transit time, colonic volume, and peristaltic movements in idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder patients, a prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease or Dementia with Lewy bodies.Twenty-two patients were included and compared to previously published data from Parkinson's disease patients and controls. Gastrointestinal transit time, computed tomography-based volume estimation, and colonic motility were performed as markers of gastrointestinal function and autonomic involvement. Subjective constipation symptoms were evaluated with two different questionnaires.Gastrointestinal transit time was increased in 33% (p\u202f=\u202f0.039) and colonic volume in 48% (p\u202f=\u202f0.0049) of patients. Colonic transit time measured by the 3D-Transit system was increased in 70% (p\u202f=\u202f0.0326) and the number of fast peristaltic colonic movements was reduced (p\u202f=\u202f0.015). Mean small intestinal transit time was comparable to Parkinson's disease patients, although not significantly different compared to controls (p\u202f=\u202f0.18). Subjective constipation symptoms were present in 18 or 41%, depending on type of questionnaire.Total gastrointestinal transit time, colonic volume, and 3D-Transit colonic transit time were significantly increased compared to controls, although not to the extent seen in medicated Parkinson's patients. Limited correlation was seen between subjective constipation and objective markers. The findings support that marked GI dysfunction is present in the early prodromal PD phase.",

Then, we compared AS deposition in the SMG tissues between the PD patients and the controls. We recruited 16 PD patients in this study. In each individual, two core needle biopsy tissues were obtained from the left submandibular gland under USG guidance. Fourteen sex and age-matched controls who did not have PD and dementia but received a core needle biopsy or surgical resection of the SMG due to SMG diseases were procured from the pathology archive. Biopsy tissues and surgical specimens were immuno-stained with serine 129 phosphorylated AS (pAS) antibody for microscopic examination. pAS deposition in neural structures such as ganglion cells and neurites was considered as positive.No serious complication occurred during and after the SMG biopsy. We found glandular parenchyma and neural structures in all biopsied SMG tissues from the patients and the controls. Nine out of 16 PD patients (56.2%) were positive for pAS staining, while none of the controls were positive (0%).SMG core needle biopsy can reliably and safely obtain sufficient glandular parenchyma and neural structures to evaluate the \u03b1-synuclein pathology. AS pathology in SMG has high specificity and good sensitivity as a biomarker for PD.",

We were interested in understanding what complementary therapies (CTs) our patients had used, to treat what symptoms, and whether they felt that the treatments were effective.Patients scheduled for a return visit to a center neurologist were mailed a survey and instructed to bring the completed survey to their clinic visit. The survey contained questions on CTs used, effectiveness, and for what symptoms was the CT helpful. Willingness to participate in CT research was also included in the survey.272 of 435 people with Parkinson's disease who completed the survey (62.5%) had tried some kind of CT, including a higher proportion of women than men (75.7% vs 53.8%; p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Massage was the most frequently used therapy followed by yoga, Tai Chi, meditation and acupuncture. A high proportion of patients found the CT to be effective, for instance meditation was viewed as helpful by 85% of patients. Almost 2/3 of patients said they would be willing to participate in a research study of a CT.Complementary therapies are frequently used by people with Parkinson's disease coming to our center, and are viewed to be helpful for both motor and non-motor symptoms.

Although some groups traditionally favor STN over GPi for tremor suppression, evidence demonstrating superiority in long-term tremor control is limited.We performed a systematic review for all randomized trials comparing STN vs GPi DBS in PD that were published before March 2017. Five studies were examined in a random effects model meta-analysis. We conducted moderator variable analysis to determine if there was a treatment effect difference for STN versus GPi.We compared DBS ON versus OFF and found a significant overall standardized difference mean effect: Effect Size\u202f=\u202f0.36; 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.316\u20130.395; P\u202f<\u202f0.0001.

In this study, we aimed to identify SYNE1-associated ataxia by whole exome sequencing in a Korean sample, and to review the prevalence of SYNE1 in non-French-Canadians.Patients with suspected cerebellar ataxia who visited movement disorders clinic from March 2014 to December 2017 were clinically screened. After excluding cases with acquired causes and common genetic causes in Korea, including spinocerebellar ataxia and dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, 63 undiagnosed subjects were screened for SYNE1 mutations by next generation sequencing methods.We identified four novel mutations (one splicing, one truncating, and two missense mutations) distributed throughout the SYNE1 gene in two patients. The phenotype was mainly pure cerebellar ataxia in both cases. However, axonal neuropathy, mild frontal dysfunction, and autonomic dysfunction were also revealed. The age of disease onset was relatively late and the disease course was only mildly progressive.Our results indicate that SYNE1 mutations are not an uncommon cause of recessive ataxia with additional clinical features in the Korean population. The results of this study should alert neurologists to request SYNE1 testing to aid the diagnosis of undetermined adult-onset ataxia in Korean patients.",

The minimal clinically important difference thresholds are the smallest changes in the outcome measures that are clinically meaningful.The aim of our study was to calculate the minimal clinically important difference thresholds for the MDS-UPDRS Part IV and the historic parts of the UDysRS.A total of 1044 paired investigations of 436 patients were analyzed. Changes in the respective outcome measures (MDS-UPDRS Part IV, UDysRS Parts I and II) were compared to the Patient-rated Global Impression of Improvement scores (anchors). Subsequently, we applied receiver-operating characteristic analysis to ascertain the MCID thresholds with optimal sensitivity and specificity.Any improvement greater than 2.1 points or any worsening greater than 1.8 points on UDysRS Part I represents a minimal, yet clinically meaningful change. In reference to UDysRS Part II, the smallest changes considered clinically relevant are 1.8 and 1.7 points for improvement and deterioration, respectively. The thresholds for the MDS-UPDRS Part IV are 0.9 points for improvement and 0.8 points for worsening.Our estimates may allow the judgment of the clinical relevance of numeric changes in the dyskinesia scales.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that PD is accompanied by high rates of premature death compared with the general population. The main causes of deaths are related to pneumonia and cardiovascular diseases. Importantly, it has also been recognized that some PD patients may eventually die unexpectedly and suddenly, referred as Sudden Unexpected Death in Parkinson's Disease (SUDPAR). Despite on-going PD research, there are still deficits in our knowledge about the risk factors, mechanisms and prevention of SUDPAR. By some means, current evidence suggests cardiac abnormalities and autonomic dysfunction plays an important role in SUDPAR. Thus, SUDPAR in patients with PD is a real phenomenon and translational studies should be carried out with the aim of elucidating this phenomenon.",

Numerous studies have investigated gait-related risk factors for falls in PD, however findings are inconsistent across studies, and thus a synthesis of the current evidence is needed to guide clinical practice and the development of interventions to reduce falls risk. The objective of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding the association between walking biomechanics and falls in people with PD, and where possible, perform meta-analyses.The study was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Databases were searched until January 2018 to identify articles that reported on the association between walking biomechanics and prospective or retrospective falls in people with PD.Twenty-six articles were included (15 prospective studies, 11 retrospective studies). Articles reported on spatiotemporal and kinematic characteristics, and muscle activation patterns. Meta-analyses revealed slower walking speed, lower cadence, shorter strides and more mediolateral head and pelvis motion in those at higher risk of future falls. Findings from prospective and retrospective articles were largely consistent.Our findings identify spatiotemporal and kinematic characteristics of gait that are risk factors for falls in PD. Modification of these characteristics may have the potential to mediate falls risk, and future research to investigate this possibility is merited. The influence of body and ground reaction forces, and muscle activation patterns on falls risk in PD is currently under-researched.",

We reported odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from multivariable logistic regression models.A total of 1623 (7.9%) farmers reported having had DEB. Farmers with DEB were more likely to report other nonmotor and motor symptoms of PD with age-adjusted ORs ranging from 1.9 to 3.0. DEB prevalence varied little by age, but was significantly associated with current smoking (adjusted OR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.2, 1.6), daily alcohol drinking (OR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1, 1.6), a history of head injury (OR: 1.3, 95%CI: 1.2, 1.5), and being married (OR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.1, 1.7). We identified significant associations for several pesticides, especially cyclodiene organochlorines and pyrethroids, with adjusted ORs ranging from 1.2 to 1.5. The results were similar after excluding PD cases or when farmers with at least three DEB episodes in life were considered as DEB cases.This study suggests that DEB are not rare among male farmers. Findings on potential risk factors for DEB are intriguing, and given the close link between RBD and PD, these associations should be further investigated.",

We aimed to determine if digitized spiral analysis can distinguish dystonia subjects from controls, and evaluated correlation with a validated clinical rating scale.Kinematic, dynamic, and spatial attributes of Archimedean spirals drawn with an inking pen on a digitizing tablet were compared for participants with brachial dystonia and either Tor1A (DYT1) (n\u202f=\u202f15) or THAP1 (DYT6) mutations (n\u202f=\u202f12) and age and gender matched controls (n\u202f=\u202f27) using Receiver Operator Characteristics (ROC) analysis. Spiral indices including an overall degree of severity (DoS) were also calculated and correlated with clinical severity ratings as measured by the Burke-Fahn-Marsden scale.Dystonia spirals had significantly higher severity scores as well as higher measures of spiral irregularity compared to controls. ROC analysis demonstrated that the DoS score had good discriminative ability to distinguish dystonia spirals from controls, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.87. Measures of spiral irregularity correlated with validated clinical rates of dystonia severity in the analyzed arm, with one particular index, Residue of Theta vs R, showing the highest correlation (r\u202f=\u202f0.55, p\u202f=\u202f0.005).Digitized spiral analysis may be a promising non-invasive method to objectively quantify brachial dystonia.

The primary endpoint was clinical success defined as any improvement in overactive bladder symptoms self-assessed by the patients 6 weeks after mirabegron initiation. Secondary endpoints included number of pads per day, number of nocturia episodes and adverse events.Fifty patients (mean 74 years old) were included. Before being treated with mirabegron, 56% had failed prior anticholinergic therapy. After 6 weeks of mirabegron 50\u202fmg, five patients (11.4%) had a complete resolution of their OAB symptoms; 25 patients (50%) reported improvement, 23 (46%) reported no change and 2(4%) reported worsening of their OAB symptoms. The number of pads per day decreased from 1.5 to 0.9 (p\u202f=\u202f0.01) and so did the number of nocturia episodes (from 3 to 2.6/night; p\u202f=\u202f0.02). Only 2 adverse events were reported during mirabegron treatment (4%): one dizziness and one diaphoresis, that disappeared after mirabegron discontinuation. After a median follow-up of 19 months, 23 patients (46%) persisted on mirabegron. Persistence rates were 51.5%, 44.6% and 36.4% at 1, 2 and 3 years respectively.Mirabegron has an excellent safety profile and appears to be an effective treatment for overactive bladder symptoms in patients with PD.

Patients underwent a clinical examination for the study of different motor functions, and the relationship between MRI and clinical variables was tested using the Spearman's coefficient.Compared to HC, FD patients showed an increase in susceptibility values of the SN (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and striatum (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), while no difference emerged for the other tested extrapyramidal structures, suggesting their relative sparing. The increased susceptibility was coupled to a reduced volume of the SN (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), but not of the striatum (p\u202f=\u202f0.34). Finally, no significant correlation emerged when probing the relationship between these modifications and the clinical variables.In FD patients, susceptibility and volumetric alterations are present throughout the extrapyramidal pathway, with the SN being particularly affected by these changes. Such results are in line with the subtle extrapyramidal involvement recently suggested in FD, and could further contribute to the understanding of the physiopathological bases of cerebral involvement in FD.",

The motor features of SWEDD patients should be understood in order to avoid costly and inappropriate treatments. Therefore, it is important to effectively differentiate SWEDD from Parkinson's disease (PD) in the early stage of disease. As bradykinesia is a cardinal clinical feature of parkinsonism, we quantitatively investigated detailed presentations of hand movement using an angular measurement system in SWEDD and PD patients as well as normal controls.Twenty-three patients with SWEDD, 23 patients with off state early stage PD, and 23 age-matched healthy controls participated in this study. Angular velocity was measured during finger-tapping and forearm-rotation movement for the assessment of bradykinesia. RMS (root mean square) velocity and amplitude as well as movement irregularity were derived from the gyro sensor signal.SWEDD patients presented a greater average speed, a larger average amplitude, and more regular speed and amplitude only during forearm rotation than PD patients (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). SWEDD patients also exhibited a smaller average speed and average amplitude, and a more irregular speed on average during finger tapping than controls (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).Quantitative variables of forearm rotation movement showed significant differences between SWEDD and PD patients, and quantitative variables of finger tapping movement showed a significant difference between SWEDD patients and the control group. These results suggest that quantitatively-assessed variables using biomedical engineering devices could aid clinicians in the identification of potential SWEDD.",

Clinical data were analyzed using the patients' functional status at pre- and post-STN-DBS, including anteflexion vs. non-anteflexion, scoliosis vs. non-scoliosis, improved anteflexion vs. non-improved anteflexion, and improved scoliosis vs. non-improved scoliosis.In patients with anteflexion, UPDRS III motor score at off medication was worse than that of patients with non-anteflexion. Patients with scoliosis presented with more comorbid spinal deformity and longer disease duration than those without scoliosis. Cobb angle of patients with asymmetrical psoas major and erector spinal muscles was more than that of patients without the asymmetry. Patients with improved anteflexion after STN-DBS had thicker abdominal oblique muscle and transverse abdominal muscle than those of patients without improved anteflexion. Patients with improved scoliosis were significantly younger at PD onset than those without improvement.There were only a few prognostic factors recognized in patients with improved postures. The thick abdominal muscle for anteflexion and younger PD onset for scoliosis were significant factors for improvement by STN-DBS. Rehabilitation designed to maintain muscle for correct postures may contribute to the amelioration of abnormal postures by STN-DBS, although multicenter trials are needed.",

The olfactory system is intimately connected to the trigeminal system, responsible for the perception of sensations such as freshness, warmth or piquancy in odorants. Usually, olfactory impairment is associated with a similar reduction of trigeminal sensitivity. A recent study suggests that the trigeminal system is not affected in patients with PD. To test this, we evaluated perception of mixed olfactory/trigeminal stimuli in 23 patients with idiopathic PD and compared them to 22 healthy matched controls. More specifically, we evaluated the trigeminal dimensions of coolness, warmth and piquancy and the olfactory dimensions of pleasantness, familiarity and edibility of 10 mixed olfactory/trigeminal odorants using Likert scale. We show that PD patients perceive trigeminal sensations of coolness, warmth, and piquancy of odorants equally well as controls, as opposed to olfactory dimensions that are perceived significantly less compared to controls (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Moreover, Chi-square Tests show that equal number of participants in both groups perceive the trigeminal dimensions of odorants. Thus, we provide further evidence that the trigeminal system, as opposed to the olfactory system, is not impaired in PD patients reflecting a specific pattern of chemosensory impairment in PD.",

However, it is not clear how STN DBS changes ICDs in the long-term.Eighty-nine patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) who had received a bilateral STN DBS from 2005 to 2009 and were included in our previous study were followed for 7 years with the modified Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (mMIDI). Their mMIDI scores, medication, and frontal function tests measured preoperatively and at 1 and 7 years postoperatively were compared.A total of 61 patients were analyzed after excluding 10 and 18 patients due to death and lost to follow-up, respectively. The numbers of the patients with an ICD at each point were 8, 10, and 7, respectively. All preoperative ICDs disappeared after DBS. De novo ICDs within 1 year after DBS disappeared except for 1 patient. Six of the seven patients, who reported ICDs 7 years after the DBS developed that ICD between 1 and 7 years. Their total levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD) and dopamine agonist dose were not higher compared to the other 54 patients without ICDs. There was no correlation with the frontal lobe dysfunction and the electrode position in the subthalamus.STN DBS improves baseline ICDs and results in the development of \u201ctransient\u201d de novo ICDs in the short-term. In addition, there is a unique group of the patients who develop ICDs a long time after DBS.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder presenting with a variety of motor and non-motor symptoms. The motor symptoms manifest as a result of the progressive degeneration of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The axons of these neurons project to the striatum as the nigrostriatal pathway, which is a crucial part of the basal ganglia circuitry controlling movement. In addition to the neuronal degeneration, abnormal intraneuronal \u03b1-synuclein protein inclusions called Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites increase in number and spread throughout the nervous system as the disease progresses. While the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons is well-established as being central to motor symptoms, there is an increasing focus on the timing of nigrostriatal degeneration, with preclinical evidence suggesting that early axonal degeneration may play a key role in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. Here we review recent evidence for early midbrain dopaminergic axonal degeneration in patients with Parkinson's disease, and explore the potential role of \u03b1-synuclein accumulation in this process, with a focus on studies in human populations at the imaging, post-mortem, cellular and molecular levels. Finally, we discuss the implications of this for neurotrophic factor therapies for Parkinson's disease.",

Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of clinical, electrophysiological, and radiological features in differentiating ET-PD syndrome from ET and PD were calculated.ET-PD patients had significantly lower rigidity (p\u202f=\u202f0.007) and higher postural/kinetic tremor (p\u202f=\u202f0.007) scores, in comparison to t-PD patients. ET-PD patients, differently from PD patients, had a synchronous pattern of resting tremor and, differently from ET patients, had abnormal blink-reflex recovery cycle. ET-PD patients also showed reduced nigro-striatal and cardiac sympathetic uptakes, albeit to a lesser extent than in PD patients. The highest accuracy values were found for the synchronous pattern of resting tremor (97.1%) in distinguishing ET-PD from PD, and for presence of abnormal blink-recovery cycle (100%) in distinguishing ET-PD syndrome from ET.Our study demonstrates that some electrophysiological parameters, such as a synchronous resting tremor pattern and the abnormal blink-recovery cycle were the most accurate biomarkers in distinguishing patient with ET-PD syndrome from those with ET or those with PD.",

Although peripheral factors such as rigidity, reduced joint movements and poor posture may contribute towards the development of pain, central mechanisms including altered nociceptive processing may also be involved.We performed a large clinical study to investigate potential factors contributing towards pain in early/moderate PD. We recruited 1957 PD participants who had detailed assessments of pain, motor and non-motor symptoms. The King's Parkinson's Pain scale was used to quantify different subtypes of pain.85% of participants reported pain (42% with moderate to severe pain). Pain influenced quality of life more than motor symptoms in a multiple regression model. Factors predicting overall pain severity included affective symptoms, autonomic symptoms, motor complications, female gender and younger age, but not motor impairment or disease duration. There was negligible correlation between the severity of motor impairment and the severity of musculoskeletal or dystonic pain as well as between the severity of OFF period motor problems and the severity of OFF period pain or OFF period dystonic pain. Features of central sensitization, including allodynia and altered pain sensation were common in this population. The use of drugs targeting central pain was very low.Pain in early/moderate PD cannot be explained by peripheral factors. Central causes may play a much more important role than previously considered. These results should lead to a major shift in the investigation and management of this common and disabling symptom.",

Early signs of postural Instability and gait disability (PIGD) are considered clues that may signal presence of APD. However, it remains unknown which PIGD test \u2013 or combination of tests \u2013 can best distinguish PD from APD. We evaluated the discriminative value of several widely-used PIGD tests, and aimed to develop a short PIGD evaluation that can discriminate parkinsonian disorders.In this multicentre cohort study patients were recruited by 11 European MSA Study sites. Patients were diagnosed using standardized criteria. Postural instability and gait disability was evaluated using interviews and several clinical tests.Nineteen PD, 21 MSA-p and 25\u202fPSP-RS patients were recruited. PIGD was more common in APD compared to PD. There was no significant difference in axial symptoms between PSP-RS and MSA-p, except for self-reported falls (more frequent in PSP-RS patients). The test with the greatest discriminative power to distinguish APD from PD was the ability to perform tandem gait (AUC 0.83; 95% CI 71\u201394; p\u202f<\u202f0.001), followed by the retropulsion test (AUC 0.8; 95% CI 0.69\u20130.91; p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and timed-up-and-go test (TUG) (AUC 0.77; 95% CI 0.64\u20130.9; p\u202f=\u202f0.001).

In this study, we aimed to identify the dopamine transporter status of the corpus striatum and thalamus using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided spatial normalization method in patients with PD according to olfactory function.Among 87 PD patients, 50 had hyposmia and 37 had normosmia. All patients underwent positron emission tomography (PET) using 18F-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2beta-carbon ethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (18F-FP-CIT) and T1-weighted MRI. PET images were normalized with simultaneously performed spatially normalized MRI and the regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) with a volume of interest template were compared according to olfactory function.The bilateral caudates and the left anterior and posterior putamen of the hyposmic group showed significantly reduced dopamine transporter uptake compared to the normosmic group. In partial correlation coefficient analysis, olfactory identification impairment was correlated with the SUVR values of the caudate nuclei.More dopaminergic impairment of the bilateral caudate nuclei was found in hyposmic PD. This finding suggests that decreased dopamine uptake in the caudate nucleus may be an imaging trace of olfactory dysfunction in patients with PD.",

The \u201cworse\u201d group was more likely to be older (p\u202f=\u202f0.001), to have motor fluctuations (p\u202f=\u202f0.011), be on cognitive enhancers (p\u202f=\u202f0.01), and to have more impaired immediate five-word recall (p\u202f=\u202f0.04). The \u201cnon-worse\u201d group was more likely to have rest tremor (p\u202f=\u202f0.003), and to utilize social work/counseling (p\u202f=\u202f0.046).The majority of predictors of worsening of HRQL are baseline disease and demographic characteristics that are difficult to modify. The positive effect of social service/counseling is intriguing and important to further explore in controlled interventional studies.",

Elevated NfL levels in CSF and blood have been observed in a growing number of neurodegenerative disorders, including frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. We studied serum NfL levels in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in relation to disease severity and survival.Serum NfL levels were determined cross-sectionally in a retrospective cohort of 131 patients with PSP and 95 healthy controls. Detailed clinical examination was performed and disease severity was assessed by several rating scales.We found that serum NfL levels in PSP were twice as high as those in controls, and that NfL levels correlated with worse functional, motor and cognitive functioning. During follow-up, 119 PSP patients had died, and higher NfL levels were associated with a shorter survival.This study provides evidence that serum NfL is a relevant and promising biomarker in PSP for disease severity, and may be used as a prognostic tool to predict survival in clinical practice.",

We aimed at assessing reproducibility of previously published data-driven PD subtype classification systems in a well-characterized cohort created for clinical research purposes, the Longitudinal and Biomarker Study in Parkinson's Disease (LABS-PD).We identified all published studies of data-driven PD subtype classification systems and included those with variables that conceptually matched the variables available in LABS-PD. We reproduced the cluster analyses of the included studies in LABS-PD. Reproducibility was determined by a panel of experts using a modified Delphi consensus process.We included eight studies of data-driven PD subtype classification systems and completed the replication in LABS-PD of the analyses conducted in each original study. After two iterations of the modified Delphi consensus process, no study was reproducible in LABS-PD.Currently published data-driven PD subtype classification systems lack reproducibility in a well-characterized cohort of patients initially recruited for a clinical trial of a disease-modifying intervention. The results raise concerns about the utility of the widely-discussed concept of data-driven PD subtypes. This gap is a barrier for a meaningful use of PD subtypes and calls for the establishment of standards for the validation and use of these subtype classification systems.",

We used linear mixed-effects models and reliable change indices (RCIs) to examine longitudinal associations between dysautonomia and dopamine transporter (DAT) striatal binding ratios (SBRs) measured by single-photon emission computerized tomography in PPMI participants over four years (n\u202f=\u202f397\u202fat baseline).Adjusted mixed-models of longitudinal data showed that constipation\u2014but not orthostatic hypotension or urinary dysfunction\u2014was associated with reduced SBR in both caudate (P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and putamen (P\u202f=\u202f0.040).

Four-year change in caudate\u2014but not putaminal\u2014SBR was significantly associated with RCI-indicated progression of GI dysautonomia (P\u202f=\u202f0.031), but not other types of dysautonomia. These associations remained after adjusting for the use of medications or supplements to control constipation. Consistent with prior PPMI reports, motor impairment progression was not associated with SBR reduction.GI dysautonomia correlates with reductions in DAT availability; constipation is most closely associated with caudate-DAT reduction.

     "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience a range of non-motor symptoms, including constipation and other gastrointestinal problems. These symptoms are sometimes present in the prodromal disease phase. An improved understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is needed considering that PD has been hypothesized to originate in the gut. Delayed gastric emptying time (GET) is often listed as a prevalent gastrointestinal symptom in PD, but the true prevalence is controversial.The aim of this short review was to investigate if GET in PD is dependent on the applied measuring methodology. A systemic search of Pubmed identified 15 relevant studies, including six using gold standard method gastric scintigraphy and nine using 13C-octanoate breath tests. Overall, gastric scintigraphy studies showed a non-significant GET delay (standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.42) in PD patients. After exclusion of one outlier study, GET was significantly increased (SMD 0.59). In contrast, highly significant GET delay (SMD 1.70) was seen in breath test studies. A limitation of the meta-analyses was reuse of the same control group in some studies. In summary, the marked GET delay observed in breath test studies is not confirmed by gold standard gastric scintigraphy studies. This discrepancy can perhaps be explained by breath test being an indirect GET measure, depending not only on mechanic stomach emptying but also intestinal absorption and liver metabolism.Thus, multi-modality studies under standardized conditions are needed to elucidate the prevalence and severity of gastric dysmotility in PD, along with contributions from other factors including intestinal absorption and permeability.",

We reviewed non-motor outcomes of DBS in dystonia, focusing on GPi-DBS.A systematic literature search of Pubmed and Embase was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines.Fifty-two studies were included. GPi-DBS reduced pain related to dystonia. No major effects on anxiety, mood, and cognition were found. In contrast to motor outcome, non-motor outcome seems more independent of the etiology of dystonia. However, the impact of potential confounders (e.g. patient factors, changes in pharmacological treatment) is unclear.Despite the growing interest in non-motor symptoms in dystonia, DBS studies still focus primarily on motor outcome. We recommend systematic evaluation of both non-motor and motor features before and after DBS interventions to improve quality of life and management of patients with dystonia.",

Demographic, clinical characteristics, motor and non-motor assessments were performed. Patients were categorized into three motor subtypes: tremor-dominant (TD), postural instability/gait difficulty (PIGD), and mixed. Non-motor symptoms were classified as present or absent based on the appropriate cut-offs for each non-motor instrument.Most patients had TD (n\u202f=\u202f51, 40.8%) and mixed (n\u202f=\u202f63, 50.4%) motor subtypes, while a minority had PIGD (n\u202f=\u202f11, 8.8%) motor subtype. The mean serum uric acid levels were significantly different between the three motor subtypes (p\u202f=\u202f0.0106), with the mixed subtype having the lowest serum uric acid levels.

We investigated whether early-life events, like perinatal insults or neurodevelopmental disorders, influence the diagnosis age.We used data from 13,856 participants from REGISTRY and Enroll-HD, two large international multicenter observational studies. Disease-free survival analyses of mutation carriers with an HTT CAG repeat expansion size above and including 36 were computed through Kaplan-Meier estimates of median time until an HD diagnosis. Comparisons between groups were computed using a Cox proportional hazard survival model adjusted for CAG-repeat expansion length. We also assessed whether the group effect depended on gender and the affected parent.Insults in the perinatal period were associated with an earlier median age of diagnosis of 45.00 years (95%CI: 42.07\u201347.92) compared to 51.00 years (95%CI: 50.68\u201351.31) in the reference group, with a CAG-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.61 (95%CI: 1.26\u20132.06).

These associations did not change significantly with gender or affected parent.These results, derived from large observational datasets, show that perinatal insults and neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with earlier ages of diagnosis of magnitudes similar to the effects of known genetic modifiers of HD. Given their clear temporal separation, these early events may be causative of earlier HD onset, but further research is needed to prove causation.",

The primary outcome measure was the difference between efficacy and side-effect thresholds (current amplitude, mA) in a monopolar review and the severity of motor symptoms (as assessed by MDS-UPDRS III ratings) after 30\u202fmin of continuous stimulation in the medication off-state.Effect and side effect thresholds were significantly higher with anodic compared to cathodic stimulation (3.36\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.58\u202fmA vs. 1.99\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.37\u202fmA; 6.05\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.52\u202fmA vs. 4.15\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.13\u202fmA; both p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). However, using a predefined amplitude of 0.5\u202fmA below the respective adverse effect threshold, blinded MDS-UPDRS-III-ratings were significantly lower with anodic stimulation (anodic: median 17 [min: 12, max: 25]; cathodic: 23 [12, 37]; p\u202f<\u202f0.005).Effective anodic stimulation requires a higher charge injection into the tissue, but may provide a better reduction of off-period motor symptoms within the individual therapeutic window.

OH was more pronounced in patients with OH+high NEsupine than in those with OH+low NEsupine (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024). Vasopressin release and percent increase of NE after orthostatic stress were well preserved in patients with OH+low NEsupine, but not in patients with OH+high NEsupine. Cognition was lower in patients with OH+high NEsupine than in patients with OH+low NEsupine (p\u202f=\u202f0.019) and was associated with vasopressin release during orthostatic stress on multiple regression analysis. The degree of cardiac sympathetic denervation did not differ between two groups with OH.Patient with PD and high norepinephrinergic OH are a subset of patients who have early cognitive decline and impaired vasopressin release. Vasopressin release after orthostatic stress was closely related to global cognition in PD.",

Thus, a long-term follow-up is indispensable.This trial was designed to examine the efficacy and consistency of subthalamic deep brain stimulation in patients with primary dystonia over the long term.This was a retrospective study involving 14 patients with primary dystonia who underwent STN-DBS and consented to a follow-up of at least 10 years. The Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS) and 36-item Short-Form General Health Survey were employed, at five time points (pre-operation [baseline], 1 month post-operation, 1 year post-operation, 5 years post-operation, and last follow-up), to assess improvement of dystonic symptoms and changes in quality of life.All patients gained extensive clinical benefits from STN-DBS therapy, without experiencing serious adverse effects. Improvements of 59.0% at 1 month, 85.0% at 1 year, and 90.8% at 5 years after the operation, and up to 91.4% at the last follow-up, were demonstrated by movement evaluation with the BFMDRS. All patients achieved a substantial improvement in quality of life.Subthalamic deep brain stimulation is an effective and persisting alternative to pallidal deep brain stimulation, and importantly, it is very safe even with extremely long-term chronic stimulation.",

The relationship between visual illusions or hallucinations and regional cerebral glucose metabolism was investigated using partial least squares (PLS) correlation and conventional mass-univariate analyses.Kinetopsia, in which stationary objects are perceived as being in motion, and object misidentification illusions, in which objects are misperceived as different objects, were the most common types of visual illusions. Kinetopsia and object misidentification illusions were identified in 24 patients (25.8%) and 17 patients (18.3%), respectively. Eleven patients with kinetopsia and 9 patients with object misidentification illusions had visual hallucinations. Kinetopsia and visual hallucinations were associated with hypometabolism in the temporo-parietal cortices, whereas object misidentification illusions were associated with hypometabolism in the early visual cortex, as well as the temporo-parietal cortices.Our findings suggest that kinetopsia and object misidentification illusions are the most common types of visual illusions in PD. Despite the phenomenological diversity of visual illusions and hallucinations in PD, all of these symptoms are associated with dysfunction of the temporo-parietal cortices, which support visual spatial processing, rather than dysfunction of the ventral temporo-occipital cortices, which supports visual object recognition.",

We collected clinical data of the PD patients, including age at onset, PD duration, levodopa-equivalent dose (LED), Hoehn and Yahr stage (H-Y stage), presence of motor fluctuation, levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID), freezing of gait, hallucination, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Iron, copper, and zinc levels in serum were assayed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Statistical analyses were performed to determine the sex-related differences in metal levels.Among the three metal elements tested, serum copper levels showed significant correlations with PD risk or clinical presentation. Higher copper levels were associated with a decreased PD risk. Higher copper or lower iron levels were associated with the risk of LID in women. Serum copper levels were negatively correlated with MMSE scores in PD patients.This clinical study suggests significant associations between serum metal levels and PD risk or essential clinical features, demonstrating the possible roles of metals in PD pathogenesis or symptom development.",

New consensus criteria for the clinical diagnosis of PSP were used as the reference standard. The MRPI, and a new index termed MRPI 2.0 including the measurement of the third ventricle width (MRPI multiplied by third ventricle width/frontal horns width ratio), were calculated on T1-weighted MR images.The MRPI differentiated patients with PSP-P from those with PD with sensitivity and specificity of 73.5% and 98.1%, respectively, while the MRPI 2.0 showed higher sensitivity (100%) and similar specificity (94.3%) in differentiating between these two groups. Both biomarkers showed excellent performance in differentiating PSP-P patients with VSGP from those with PD, but the MRPI 2.0 was much more accurate (95.8%) than MRPI in differentiating PSP-P patients with slowness of vertical saccades from PD patients.The MRPI 2.0 accurately differentiated PSP-P patients from those with PD. This new index was more powerful than MRPI in differentiating PSP patients in the early stage of the disease with slowness of vertical saccades from patients with PD, thus helping clinicians to consolidate the diagnosis based on clinical features, in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Programming of globus pallidus pars interna (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems for dystonia is complex because clinical benefits are often gradual. Some groups have advocated starting DBS with higher electrical parameters, whereas others have suggested the opposite. This variability in programming, even within each dystonia subtype, makes it challenging to compare outcomes and program the generators. To determine how variable DBS for dystonia stimulation parameters are, we performed a systematic literature review.A comprehensive systematic literature search for GPi DBS stimulation parameters used in dystonia was performed in PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases.Of 813 publications retrieved from individual search engines, 593 were eligible for review and 401 publications were excluded. Data were extracted from 192 publications representing 1505 patients and 2964 electrodes. Stimulation amplitude averaged 3.3\u202fV\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.6\u202fV and frequency 131\u202fHz\u202f\u00b1\u202f5\u202fHz.

Some dystonia subtypes may improve with specific pulse widths. This review emphasizes the importance of complete data reporting in the literature and suggests that large prospective controlled blinded studies and international registries are needed to understand and optimize DBS settings for dystonia.",

Postural imbalance and gait difficulties in Parkinson's disease (PD), therefore, may stem not only from the primary neurodegenerative process but also from age-related medical comorbidities. Elucidation of the effects of peripheral neuropathy on these difficulties in PD is important to provide more targeted and effective therapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between lower-limb peripheral neuropathy and falls and gait performance in PD while accounting for disease-specific factors.From a total of 140 individuals with PD, 14 male participants met the criteria for peripheral neuropathy and were matched 1:1 for Hoehn & Yahr stage and duration of disease with 14 male participants without peripheral neuropathy. All participants underwent fall (retrospectively) and gait assessment, a clinical evaluation, and [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine and [11C]methylpiperidin-4-yl propionate PET imaging to assess dopaminergic and cholinergic denervation, respectively.The presence of peripheral neuropathy was significantly associated with more falls (50% vs. 14%, p\u202f=\u202f0.043), as well as a shorter stride length (p\u202f=\u202f0.011) and greater stride length variability (p\u202f=\u202f0.004), which resulted in slower gait speed (p\u202f=\u202f0.016) during level walking. There was no significant difference in nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation, cortical and thalamic cholinergic denervation, and MDS-UPDRS motor examination scores between groups.Lower-limb peripheral neuropathy is significantly associated with more falls and gait difficulties in PD. Thus, treating such neuropathy may reduce falls and/or improve gait performance in PD.",

Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed no statistically significant differences between DBS duration and amount of gliosis.This study revealed that approximately three out of four post-mortem DBS cases exhibited pathological evidence of a glial collar or scar present at the ventral DBS lead tip. The amount of gliosis was not significantly associated with duration of DBS. Future studies should include serial sectioning across all DBS contacts with correlation to the volume of tissue activation and to the clinical outcome.",

     "abstract": "Limited data suggests that an altered metabolic and cardiorespiratory exercise response may affect exercise performance in individuals with Huntington's disease (HD). There is no clear exploration of the response in individuals at different stages of the disease or in relation to genetic markers. This study aimed to examine the exercise response and recovery of HD participants, and the relationship to genetic and clinical markers.HD gene-positive participants (n\u202f=\u202f31; 9 pre-manifest; 22 manifest HD) and a healthy control group (n\u202f=\u202f29) performed an incremental exercise test until exhaustion. Performance, cardiorespiratory, metabolic and perceptual responses to exercise were determined from a maximal cycle ergometer test throughout the exercise test and during a recovery period.During sub-maximal exercise, metabolic (lactate levels, oxygen uptake) and cardiorespiratory markers (heart rate) were elevated in HD participants compared to controls. Lactate elevation was specific to pre-manifest HD participants. Work capacity was reduced in both pre-manifest and manifest HD participants with tests terminated with no difference in metabolic, perceptual or cardiorespiratory markers. Submaximal oxygen uptake was correlated with motor score, whilst peak measures were unrelated to genetic or clinical markers. Heart rate recovery was attenuated in pre-manifest and manifest HD participants.Our findings confirm metabolic and cardiorespiratory deficits reduce exercise performance and affect recovery from an early stage in HD, with submaximal deficits related to phenotypic expression. Exercise capacity appears to be limited by an altered movement economy, thus clinicians should consider an altered exercise response and recovery may affect prescription in HD.",

We aimed at investigating anosognosia for cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Parkinson's Disease (PD) with dementia (PDD) and, for the first time, in PD with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI-PD).Community dwelling subjects (47 mild PDD, 136 multidomain MCI-PD (mdMCI-PD), 5 single domain MCI-PD (sdMCI-PD), and 197 PD without cognitive impairment (noCI-PD) were enrolled in a cross-sectional design study. All the subjects were administered the Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia, the Mental Deterioration Battery and a number of neuropsychiatric inventories.A diagnosis of anosognosia was made in 36% of patients with mild PDD and 16% with mdMCI-PD, whether it was negligible in sdMCI-PD and noCI-PD. Higher severity of anosognosia for cognitive impairment was also found in PDD and in mdMCI-PD. SdMCI-PD had the lower severity of anosognosia for cognitive impairment.

We examined associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLC2A9 and other genes involved in urate transport and PD risk using conditional logistic regression among 1451 cases and 3135 matched controls. We assessed associations between SNPs and plasma urate levels in a subset of 1174 control participants with linear regression models.We found the expected associations between SNPs in SLC2A9 and plasma urate levels among men and women; however, SNPs in other genes tended not to be associated with urate. Each SNP in SLC2A9 explained less than 7% of the variance in plasma urate. We did not find significant associations between the SNPs in SLC2A9 and PD risk among men or women.Our results do not support an association between genetic variants associated with circulating urate levels and risk of PD, but larger investigations are needed to determine whether the modest genetic effects on blood urate contribute to predict PD risk.",

As testing for Huntington's disease (HD) becomes more available in previously resource-limited regions, it is becoming apparent that there are patients in these areas with other rare genetic conditions which cause an HD-like phenotype. Documentation of the presence of these conditions is important in order to provide appropriate diagnostic and clinical care for these populations. Information for this article was gathered in two ways; the literature was surveyed for publications reporting a variety of genetic choreic disorders, and movement disorders specialists from countries in Latin America and the Caribbean were contacted regarding their experiences with chorea of genetic etiology. Here we discuss the availability of molecular diagnostics for HD and for other choreic disorders, along with a summary of the published reports of affected subjects, and authors' personal experiences from the regions. While rare, patients affected by non-HD genetic choreas are evidently present in Latin America and the Caribbean. HD-like 2 is particularly prevalent in countries where the population has African ancestry. The incidence of other conditions is likely determined by other variations in ethnic background and settlement patterns. As genetic resources and awareness of these disorders improve, more patients are likely to be identified, and have the potential to benefit from education, support, and ultimately molecular therapies.",

This study explored the concordance between motor asymmetry and changes of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging.Forty-four subjects with PD and fifteen healthy controls were included in this study. Clinical laterality (CL) was based on the motor sub scores of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale-Part III. All subjects underwent neuromelanin-sensitive imaging and imaging laterality (IL) was based on the differences between contrast ratios of the right and left lateral SNc. Concordance was evaluated by correlating CL and IL.Motor asymmetry at disease onset was reported in 97.72% of subjects with PD, of which 65.90% reported right-sided onset. Forty-three subjects were right-handed and 68.18% reported onset of symptoms on dominant side. Right CL was observed in 59.09%, left CL in 40.90%, right IL in 11.36% and left IL in 88.63%. Concordance was established in 61.36%, majority of whom had a combination of right CL and left IL. In healthy controls, a significantly lower contrast ratio of the left lateral SNc was also noted.Handedness may correlate with motor asymmetry and left hemisphere may have a predilection for neurodegeneration. The finding of significant neuronal loss of left SNc in controls warrants further evaluation for better understanding of motor asymmetry in PD. Neuromelanin sensitive imaging can be a useful tool to study the relationship between motor asymmetry and nigrostriatal dysfunction.",

To expand knowledge of non-motor symptoms in dystonia, and to test for a potential endophenotype, we examined olfactory function in cervical dystonia (CD).In patients with CD, and neurologically healthy controls, olfactory function was examined by \"Sniffin' Sticks\", a test of nasal chemosensory function based on pen-like odor dispensing devices. This test enables to define an individual's odor threshold, odor discrimination, and odor identification. Owing to the etiological heterogeneity of olfactory dysfunction, strict exclusion criteria were applied, especially smoking, and sinonasal disease.58 CD patients completed the study. Olfactory dysfunction was present in 29 patients (50.0%), significantly more frequent than in two groups of matched healthy control subjects (20.7%; 22.4%; p\u202f=\u202f0.001). Analysis of the pattern of hyposmia revealed that odor threshold (p\u202f=\u202f0.002), and odor identification (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) were significantly worse in CD patients compared to controls, while odor discrimination was unchanged. Higher age was the only clinical characteristic to correlate with olfactory dysfunction in CD.Our observations establish olfactory dysfunction, possibly of both peripheral and central origin, as a new non-motor, and probably motor-unrelated, symptom of CD. Additionally, the potential involvement of cerebellar functions in olfactory identification and discrimination tasks, as well as in pathophysiology of dystonia, justifies further studies of olfactory dysfunction as a possible endophenotype in dystonia.",

     "abstract": "Compare clinical characteristics and outcomes in cases where DAT-SPECT imaging is used to distinguish Parkinson's disease from Drug-Induced Parkinsonsim.Clinical uncertainty in diagnosing Parkinson's disease is common when patients are on dopamine-blocking medications. DAT-SPECT imaging can improve diagnostic certainty but little data are available on clinical characteristics and outcomes associated with normal and abnormal scan results.Retrospective chart review of patients seen at a movement disorders center between 2011 and 2017 where DAT-SPECT was ordered to distinguish Parkinson's disease from Drug-induced Parkinsonism. Descriptive statistics were calculated for variables of interest and compared by scan result. Chi-squared analyses was carried out for categorical variables and students' t-tests for continuous values.51 patients met inclusion criteria with 36 normal scans and 15 abnormal scans. Those with greater than 2 cardinal manifestations (tremor, rigidity, akinesia, postural instability) were more likely to have an abnormal scan (63.89% vs 93.33%, p\u202f=\u202f0.04). No other clinical characteristics assessed were associated with scan results. Atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole 39.21%, olanzapine 31.37%) and mood stabilizers (valproic acid 33.33%, lithium 17.65%) were most commonly associated with suspected Drug-induced Parkinsonism cases. A post-scan change in management occurred in 41.18% of patients. 55.56% of patients with normal scans responded to changes in the offending medication, with 16.66% taking over 3 months to show improvement.Many DAT-SPECT scans at our institution are ordered to distinguish Parkinson's disease from Drug-induced Parkinsonism because clinical characteristics alone are unreliable. DAT-SPECT results lead to changes in management and the outcomes of these changes are consistent with scan results.",

     "abstract": "Technological solutions for quantifying Parkinson's disease (PD) symptoms may provide an objective means to track response to treatment, including side effects such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Vision-based systems are advantageous as they do not require physical contact with the body and have minimal instrumentation compared to wearables. We have developed a vision-based system to quantify a change in dyskinesia as reported by patients using 2D videos of clinical assessments during acute levodopa infusions.Nine participants with PD completed a total of 16 levodopa infusions, where they were asked to report important changes in dyskinesia (i.e. onset and remission). Participants were simultaneously rated using the UDysRS Part III (from video recordings analyzed post-hoc). Body joint positions and movements were tracked using a state-of-the-art deep learning pose estimation algorithm applied to the videos. 416 features (e.g. kinematics, frequency distribution) were extracted to characterize movements. The sensitivity and specificity of each feature to patient-reported changes in dyskinesia severity was computed and compared with physician-rated results.Features achieved similar or superior performance to the UDysRS for detecting the onset and remission of dyskinesia. The best AUC for detecting onset of dyskinesia was 0.822 and for remission of dyskinesia was 0.958, compared to 0.826 and 0.802 for the UDysRS.Video-based features may provide an objective means of quantifying the severity of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and have responsiveness as good or better than the clinically-rated UDysRS. The results demonstrate encouraging evidence for future integration of video-based technology into clinical research and eventually clinical practice.",

However, there is no established agreement on the minimum degree of forward flexion needed to diagnose camptocormia. Likewise, the current definition does not categorize camptocormia on the basis of the bending fulcrum.We performed a survey among movement disorders experts to identify camptocormia using images of patients with variable degrees and types of forward trunk flexion by fulcrum (upper and lower fulcra). We tested the subsequently generated diagnostic criteria in a sample of 131 consecutive patients referred for evaluation of postural abnormalities.Experts reached full consensus on lower camptocormia (L1-Sacrum, hip flexion) with a bending angle \u226530\u00b0 and upper camptocormia (C7 to T12-L1) with a bending angle \u226545\u00b0. This definition detected camptocormia in 9/131 consecutive PD patients (2 upper/7 lower) but excluded camptocormia in 71 patients considered to have camptocormia by the referring neurologist.Camptocormia can be defined as \u201can involuntary flexion of the spine appearing during standing or walking and resolving in the supine position of at least 30\u00b0 at the lumbar fulcrum (L1-Sacrum, hip flexion, i.e. lower camptocormia) and/or at least 45\u00b0 at the thoracic fulcrum (C7 to T12-L1, i.e. upper camptocormia)\u201d. Strict criteria for camptocormia are met by 7% of patients with abnormal posture.

Studies have shown that patients with episodic freezing episodes also have deficits in continuous gait. We evaluated whether there was an objective gait correlate to the increased stumbling reported by many patients with gait freezing.PD subjects and healthy controls (HC) were enrolled after IRB approval. Subjects with more than 1 fall/day or a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score <10 were excluded. Subjects walked at their normal pace, 8 lengths of a 20\u202f\u00d7\u202f4 foot pressure-sensor mat. Data was collected and analyzed using PKMAS software (Protokinetics) and statistical analysis performed using SPSS 22 (IBM).72 age matched subjects (22 PD FOG, 27 PD no-FOG, and 23 HC) were enrolled. Disease duration and Hoehn & Yahr scores were not significantly different between the PD groups. Mean dimensions of foot strike were not significantly different between groups, but PD FOG subjects had increased step-to-step variability in foot strike as measured by the percent coefficient of variation (%CV) in foot strike length compared to PD no-FOG and HC, independent of stride velocity. In PD no-FOG subjects, fallers also had higher variability in foot strike length compared to non-fallers.PD subjects with FOG had increased variability in foot strike suggesting that in addition to stride length variability, foot strike variability could contribute to imbalance leading to falls.",

Non-motor phenomena (e.g., anxiety, depression and apathy) have been related to representation of autonomic and somatosensory sensations (interoception), and recent findings suggest interoceptive deficits in PD.To test whether interoceptive processing is differently affected in TD and PIGD phenotypes, by assessing both interoceptive accuracy and sensibility in PD patients with TD and PIGD subtypes, and in healthy controls.Interoceptive accuracy was measured by the heartbeat perception task requiring participants to count their own heartbeats in a given time interval. A time-estimation, control task was also administered asking participants to count the seconds in a set period of time. Interoceptive sensibility was assessed by a questionnaire of subjective interoception. Finally, the patients underwent measures of anxiety, depression, apathy and anhedonia, and impulsive-compulsive disturbances.The main results showed reduced interoceptive accuracy and sensibility in TD patients relative to both PIGD patients and healthy controls. Reduced interoceptive accuracy of TD group was a reliable result since their performance on the time estimation control task was comparable to that of both PIGD patients and healthy controls.These findings demonstrate that the behavioural assessment of different aspects of interoceptive processing can provide with a further marker for subtyping patients with PD.",

Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance, imaging data was acquired over the primary somatosensory and motor cortices during passively delivered, computer-automated tactile stimulation of digits 2 and 5 of the more affected hand in PD and the analogous hand in controls. Short and long-latency afferent inhibition (SAI, LAI) were assessed via median nerve stimulation followed by transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortical representation of the first dorsal interosseous muscle.Compared to controls, PD subjects demonstrated diminished activation within the somatosensory cortex, reduced LAI and normal SAI, of which all were insensitive to dopaminergic medications. In addition to improving motor symptoms, dopaminergic medications reduced the hyperactivity observed within primary motor cortex in PD.Somatosensory processing is deficient in PD. Reduction in tactile-evoked activation within primary motor cortex may contribute to improvement in motor symptoms with dopaminergic medications.",

This study examines exercise's effects on gait performance, neural correlates related to these effects, and potential neural activation differences between freezers and non-freezers during motor imagery (MI) of gait.Thirty-seven participants from a larger exercise intervention completed behavioral assessments and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans before and after a 12-week exercise intervention. Gait performance was characterized using gait velocity and stride length, and a region of interest (ROI) fMRI analysis examined task-based blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal changes of the somatomotor network (SMN) during MI of forward (IMG-FWD) and backward (IMG-BWD) gait.Velocity (F(1,34)\u202f=\u202f55.04, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and stride length (F(1,34)\u202f=\u202f77.58, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) were significantly lower for backward versus forward walking in all participants. The ROI analysis showed freezers had lower BOLD signal compared to non-freezers in the cerebellum (F(1,32)\u202f=\u202f7.01, p\u202f=\u202f0.01), primary motor (left: F(1,32)\u202f=\u202f7.09, p\u202f=\u202f0.01; right: F(1,32)\u202f=\u202f7.45, p\u202f=\u202f0.01), and primary sensory (left: F(1,32)\u202f=\u202f9.59, p\u202f=\u202f0.004; right: F(1,32)\u202f=\u202f8.18, p\u202f=\u202f0.007) cortices during IMG-BWD only. The evidence suggests the exercise intervention did not affect gait or BOLD signal during MI.While all participants had significantly slower and shorter backward velocity and stride length, respectively, the exercise intervention had no effect. Similarly, BOLD signal during MI did not change with exercise; however, freezers had significantly lower BOLD signal during IMG-BWD compared to non-freezers. This suggests potential decreased recruitment of the SMN during MI of gait in freezers.",

So far there is no consensus on how to measure the angle of flexion, and studies therefore give differing results. Harmonization is needed for both research and clinical practice. Orthopedic measures are not useful for this purpose.Two expert raters independently analyzed the photographs of 39 Parkinson patients with camptocormia while standing. They used four different methods to determine the camptocormia angle. The results were compared statistically. An international Consensus Group reviewed the results and drafted recommendations.The four methods yielded camptocormia angles that differed by up to 50% in the same patient. Inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability also differed, but were satisfactory to excellent.This Consensus Group concluded that two of the methods qualified as reliable measures of the trunk angles in standing patients based on their clinimetric properties. They propose that the \u2018total camptocomia angle\u2019 be the angle between the line from the lateral malleolus to the L5 spinous process and the line between the L5 spinous process and the spinous process of C7.

     "abstract": "Freezing of gait is a devastating symptom of Parkinson's disease and other forms of parkinsonism. It poses a major burden on both patients and their families, as freezing often leads to falls, fall-related injuries and a loss of independence. Treating freezing of gait is difficult for a variety of reasons: it has a paroxysmal and unpredictable nature; a multifaceted pathophysiology, with an interplay between motor elements (disturbed stepping mechanisms) and non-motor elements (cognitive decline, anxiety); and a complex (and likely heterogeneous) underlying neural substrate, involving multiple failing neural networks. In recent years, advances in translational neuroscience have offered new insights into the pathophysiology underlying freezing. Furthermore, the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of available treatments (or lack thereof) are better understood. Driven by these concepts, researchers and clinicians have begun to improve currently available treatment options, and develop new and better treatment methods. Here, we evaluate the range of pharmacological (i.e. closed-looped approaches), surgical (i.e. multi-target and adaptive deep brain and spinal cord stimulation) and behavioural (i.e. biofeedback and cueing on demand) treatment options that are under development, and propose novel avenues that are likely to play a crucial role in the clinical management of freezing of gait in the near future. The outcomes of this review suggest that the successful future management of freezing of gait will require individualized treatments that can be implemented in an on-demand manner in response to imminent freezing. With this review we hope to guide much-needed advances in treating this devastating symptom of Parkinson's disease.",

By contrast, seven out of 15 tPD patients (46.7%) did not show any variation in tremor amplitude after placebo administration (non-responders). Apomorphine induced a marked reduction in tremor amplitude at 30\u202fmin and 60\u202fmin in all investigated tPD patients. Of note, the decrease in tremor amplitude in placebo responders was similar to that achieved with dopaminergic stimulation induced by apomorphine.Our study demonstrates that placebo was very effective in reducing resting tremor in about half of patients with tPD. The decrease in tremor amplitude in placebo responders was similar to that induced by apomorphine. The cerebral mechanisms underlying the placebo effect on resting tremor need further investigations.",

Endophenotypes are useful; they may clarify diagnosis in genetic studies and foster the development of animal models. In recent years, problems with balance and mild gait ataxia have been associated with essential tremor (ET). We compared gait and balance of first-degree relatives of ET cases (FD-ET) to that of age-matched controls (Co).One-hundred-ninety FD-ET and 68 Co, none of whom reported tremor or were diagnosed with ET, underwent a standardized assessment of gait and balance.FD-ET reported more near-falls in the past year (p\u202f=\u202f0.015) and lower balance confidence according to the Activities of Balance Confidence (ABC-6) Scale (p\u202f=\u202f0.03). The specific ABC-6 items for which FD-ET reported lower balance confidence than Co were being bumped into by people while walking (p\u202f=\u202f0.006) and walking outside on icy sidewalks (p\u202f=\u202f0.007). On videotaped neurological examination, FD-ET were able to stand in the tandem position for fewer seconds than were Co (p\u202f=\u202f0.048). The differences between FD-ET and Co, although statistically significant, were clinically mild.FD-ET reported more near-falls in the past year and a reduction in balance confidence; additionally, ability to maintain tandem stance was impaired compared to Co. These data suggest a more pervasive abnormality of cerebellar dysfunction than previously conceived, extending beyond ET cases themselves and manifesting in mild form in their unaffected family members.",

Although Cystatin C (Cys C) and low-density cholesterol lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) are known to play critical roles in Parkinsonism, it is unknown whether they can be used as markers to distinguish PSP patients from healthy subjects and to determine disease severity.We conducted a cross-sectional study to determine plasma Cys C/HDL/LDL-C levels of 40 patients with PSP and 40 healthy age-matched controls. An extended battery of motor and neuropsychological tests, including the PSP-Rating Scale (PSPRS), the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), was used to evaluate the disease severity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were adopted to assess the prognostic accuracy of Cys C/LDL-C levels in distinguishing PSP from healthy subjects.Patients with PSP exhibited significantly higher plasma levels of Cys C and lower LDL-C. The levels of plasma Cys C were positively and inversely correlated with the PSPRS/NMSS and MMSE scores, respectively. The LDL-C/HDL-C ratio was positively associated with PSPRS/NMSS and GDS scores. The ROC curve for the combination of Cys C and LDL-C yielded a better accuracy for distinguishing PSP from healthy subjects than the separate curves for each parameter.Plasma Cys C and LDL-C may be valuable screening tools for differentiating PSP from healthy subjects; while they could be useful for the PSP intensifies and severity evaluation. A better understanding of Cys C and LDL-C may yield insights into the pathogenesis of PSP.",

Understanding the relationship between these phenotypes may yield insight into the underlying anatomical pathways, assisting in the search for simple non-invasive markers of early neurodegeneration.To explore the correlations between eye movement parameters with multi-domain cognitive functions in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease without dementia.This is a cross-sectional case-control study of Parkinson's disease patients without dementia. Participants underwent global and domain-specific cognitive tests and an eye-tracking visual search task to characterize eye movement parameters.62 Chinese Parkinson's disease patients without dementia and 62 sex-, age- and education-matched controls were recruited. The disease group performed worse in multiple cognitive tasks and exhibited a smaller saccadic amplitude. Negative correlations between the eye fixation duration and performance in semantic verbal fluency, verbal and visual recognition memory tasks were observed, though there was no moderation effect on the correlations due to the presence of Parkinson's disease. A common cholinergic deficit in the temporal and parietal regions may account for the observed correlations. The lack of association with predominantly frontal-executive tasks may suggest specificity of these correlations.Prolonged visual fixation duration is correlated with poorer performance in semantic verbal fluency, verbal and visual recognition memory tasks in Parkinson's disease patients without dementia, although these correlations are not specific. The clinical utility of eye movement parameters as an early marker for cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease warrants further exploration in longitudinal studies.",

Compared to the control subjects, male patients with PD-H-UA had higher cortical functional connectivity (FC), while female patients had lower cortical FC regardless of UA level within all seeds. In a direct comparison, male patients with PD-H-UA had increased FC than did those with PD-L-UA.

The distance of DBS contacts to the NBM were calculated using CT-MRI fusion.Delta (1\u20134\u202fHz) oscillations were more prominently present in the NBM region than in its vicinity, whereas temporal coherence in the theta (4\u20138\u202fHz) range was less outspoken.These neurophysiological characteristics, if also proven in larger cohorts, might help to map the NBM more precisely during electrode implantation.",

     "abstract": "Differentiating between functional jerks (FJ) and organic myoclonus can be challenging. At present, the only advanced diagnostic biomarker to support FJ is the Bereitschaftspotential (BP). However, its sensitivity is limited and its evaluation subjective. Recently, event related desynchronisation in the broad beta range (13\u201345\u202fHz) prior to functional generalised axial (propriospinal) myoclonus was reported as a possible complementary diagnostic marker for FJ. Here we study the value of ERD together with a quantified BP in clinical practice.Twenty-nine patients with FJ and 16 patients with cortical myoclonus (CM) were included. Jerk-locked back-averaging for determination of the \u2018classical\u2019 and quantified BP, and time-frequency decomposition for the event related desynchronisation (ERD) were performed. Diagnostic gain, sensitivity and specificity were obtained for individual and combined techniques.We detected a classical BP in 14/29, a quantitative BP in 15/29 and an ERD in 18/29 patients. At group level we demonstrate that ERD in the broad beta band preceding a jerk has significantly higher amplitude in FJ compared to CM (respectively\u00a0\u22120.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 and\u00a0+0.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09 (p\u202f<\u202f0.001)). Adding ERD to the classical BP achieved an additional diagnostic gain of 53%. Furthermore, when combining ERD with quantified and classical BP, an additional diagnostic gain of 71% was achieved without loss of specificity.Based on the current findings we propose to the use of combined beta ERD assessment and quantitative BP analyses in patients with a clinical suspicion for all types of FJ with a negative classical BP.",

Identification of biomarkers tracking neurodegeneration before the onset of motor symptoms is important for future interventional studies. Our study aimed to contribute in the phenotypic characterization of the premanifest HD phase.28 premanifest subjects (preHD), 25 age-matched controls, and 12 manifest HD patients were enrolled for the study. The participants underwent a multimodal protocol including cognitive evaluations, arithmetic ability test, posturography, composite cerebellar functional test (CCFS), and brain 3T-MRI. PreHD were divided at the group median for predicted years to expected onset into \u201cfar-from-onset\u201d (>15\u202fyears, PreHD-far), and \u201cclose-to-onset\u201d (\u226415 years, preHD-close).

PreHD-close had reduced striatum and globus pallidus volumes and left occipital cortical thinning compared to controls. Compared to PreHD far-from-onset, PreHD-close showed bilateral cortical thinning in occipital and parahippocampal regions, inversely correlating with burden score and prognostic index for HD. CCFS only differed between controls and manifest HD. PreHD far-from-onset did not show significant differences in comparison with controls.We confirmed that quantitative brain MRI represents a valid biomarker of neurodegeneration in preHD. Posturography and Arithmentic tests seem promising tools for detecting early changes in premanifest HD, but need to be further confirmed in large cohorts.",

Similar results were found when comparing familial vs. sporadic ET cases, and ET cases with head tremor vs. those without head tremor. Among all ET cases, lower CF synaptic density was associated with lower PC counts and higher torpedo counts. In addition, higher percentage of CFs in the PF territory was associated with lower PC counts and higher torpedo counts.These findings support the notion that changes in the distribution of CF-PC synapses are broadly part of the neurodegenerative process in the ET cerebellum.",

Mutations, ferroxidase activity and Western Blot analysis of ceruloplasmin were performed according to standard protocols.Three mutations were already described (p.Phe217Ser, deletions of exon 11 and 12), p.Ile991Thr is a very rare variant, p.Cys338Ser and IVS6+1G\u00a0>\u00a0A were novel mutations. In silico analyses suggested they were highly likely or likely to be damaging. At diagnosis, 100% had microcytosis, 86% had mild-moderate anemia, low serum iron and high serum ferritin. Four (57%) had type 1 diabetes or glucose intolerance, 3/7 had neurological manifestations, and only one had early diabetic retinopathy. All but one underwent iron chelation therapy requiring temporary discontinuation because of anemia worsening. At the end of follow-up, three patients aggravated and 2 developed neurological symptoms; only two patients were free of neurological manifestations and showed mild or absent brain iron.Aceruloplasminemia phenotypes ranged from classical characterized by progressive neurologic derangement to milder in which signs of systemic iron overload prevailed over brain iron accumulation. Within this large heterogeneity, microcytosis with or without anemia, low serum iron and high serum ferritin were the early hallmarks of the disease. Therapeutic approaches other than iron chelation should be explored to reduce morbidity and improve life expectancy.",

Using quantification of the dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in each striatal sub-region with 18F-FP-CIT PET scans, we performed inter-group comparative analysis of DAT availability and multivariate linear regression analysis to assess the association between DAT availability and cognitive performance. Additionally, the effect of baseline DAT availability on the cognitive decline across time as well as on changes in the cognitive status was estimated.The PD-MCI group exhibited more severely decreased DAT availability in all the striatal sub-regions compared to the PD-CogN group, although there was no significant difference in PD duration. The DAT availability in the caudate, anterior putamen, and ventral striatum was directly associated with attention/working memory, frontal/executive, and visuospatial functions, while the DAT availability of the posterior putamen was not. However, the baseline DAT availability of the striatal sub-regions did not influence the cognitive decline or cognitive status in the longitudinal cognitive assessment.Our results suggest that striatal DAT availability may determine MCI in patients with de novo PD. Dopamine loss in the associative and limbic striatum is closely linked to cognitive deficits in early-stage PD, although it does not affect cognitive prognosis.",

The participants were divided into tertiles according to the baseline dopamine transporter (DAT) uptake of each striatal subregion, and the cumulative risk of FOG was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the predictive power of DAT uptake of striatal subregions for the development of FOG.During a median follow-up period of 4.0 years, 143 patients with PD (36.7%) developed FOG. The severe reduction group of DAT uptake in the caudate nucleus and putamen had a significantly higher incidence of FOG than that of the mild and moderate reduction groups. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that DAT uptakes in the caudate nucleus (hazard ratio [HR] 0.551; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.392\u20130.773; p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and putamen (HR 0.441; 95% CI 0.214\u20130.911; p\u202f=\u202f0.027) predicted the development of FOG. In addition, male sex, higher postural instability and gait difficulty score, and a lower Montreal Cognitive Assessment score were also significant predictors of FOG.Our finding suggests that presynaptic striatal dopaminergic denervation predicts the later development of FOG in de novo patients with PD, which may provide reliable insight into the mechanism of FOG in terms of nigrostriatal involvement.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) patients who are treated with dopamine replacement therapy are at risk of developing impulse control disorders (ICDs) (such as gambling, binge eating, and others). According to recent evidence, compulsive reward seeking in ICDs may arise from an excessive attribution of incentive salience (or \u2018wanting\u2019) to rewards.In this study, we tested this hypothesis in patients with PD who developed binge eating (BE).Patients with BE, patients without BE, and healthy controls performed different experimental tasks assessing food liking and wanting. Participants first rated the degree of liking and wanting for different foods using explicit self-report measures. They then performed an affective priming task that measured participants' affective reactions towards foods (liking), and a grip-force task that assessed their motivation for food rewards (wanting). All participants also completed several questionnaires assessing impulsivity, reward sensitivity, anxiety and depression, and underwent a neuropsychological evaluation.Patients with BE displayed an altered liking for sweet foods compared to controls but not to patients without BE. Furthermore, this difference emerged only when implicit measures were used. Importantly, an increased wanting was not associated with binge eating even if wanting, but not liking scores significantly correlated with LED levodopa, confirming the hypothesis of a distinction between the two components of rewards. Lastly, binge eating was associated with depression and lower working memory scores.Take together these results suggest that binge eating in PD is associated with cognitive abnormalities, and to lesser extent affective abnormalities, but not with an increased incentive salience.",

Of note, close collaboration of neurologists and geneticists was instrumental for proper data interpretation.We expand the phenotypic, genotypic, and ethnical spectrum of mutations in these genes. Our findings alert neurologists that rare genetic causes should be considered in complex phenotypes regardless of ethnicity.",

Primary endpoint of the study was improvement in chorea. Additionally, we evaluated the effects of GPi DBS on the motor part of the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), bradykinesia, dystonia, functional impairment, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. Side effects were systematically assessed.The chorea subscore was significantly reduced postoperatively (\u221247% six months,\u00a0\u221240% twelve months postoperatively). The UHDRS total motor score was significantly reduced at six months postoperatively (- 17%) but the effect was not sustained twelve months after the operation (- 5%). Pallidal DBS did not improve other motor symptoms or functional impairment. There was no effect on psychiatric symptoms or cognition. A number of side effects were noted, especially spasticity in three of the patients.Pallidal DBS is a treatment option for HD patients with severe pharmacologically refractory chorea. Further studies are needed to define optimal candidates for this procedure.",

A region of interest (ROI) approach was used to estimate DAT uptake ratios from 123I-FP-CIT SPECT scans in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus after normalization to a DAT template. DAT uptake ratios for each region were compared between subgroups using ANCOVA and linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between severity of rest tremor and regional DAT uptake ratios.PD patients had significantly lower DAT uptake ratios in the pallidum, putamen and caudate as compared to healthy controls (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). ANCOVA showed inter-PD subgroup differences in DAT uptake ratios in the putamen and pallidum (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) after adjustment for age and disease duration, with post-hoc comparisons revealing significantly higher DAT uptake ratios for the tremor-dominant subgroup as compared to non-tremor and indeterminate subgroups (p\u202f<\u202f0.016). There was no significant relationship between rest tremor severity and pallidal DAT either in the tremor-dominant subgroup or in the total PD population.Pallidal dopaminergic denervation appears unrelated to rest tremor severity in early Parkinson's disease.",

To date, eight DCTN1 mutations have been identified associated with Perry syndrome. A novel F52L DCTN1 mutation case of Perry syndrome is characterized by late-onset parkinsonism and frontotemporal atrophy.A Japanese woman suffered from slowly progressing parkinsonism since age 48. At age 59, she developed central hypoventilation, and required breathing assistance. Gene analysis identified a p.F52L mutation in DCTN1 and she was diagnosed with Perry syndrome. She died of aspiration pneumonia at age 74.Postmortem examination revealed severe neuronal loss in the substantia nigra and the putamen. Immunohistochemistry for DCTN1 revealed many abnormal aggregates, mainly in neurons in the brainstem and basal ganglia. Additionally, numerous abnormal phosphorylated tau deposits including neurofibrillary tangles, tuft-shaped astrocytes and coiled bodies were observed mainly in the basal ganglia, brainstem and cerebellum. These correspond with the neuropathologic criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy. Colocalization of DCTN1 and tau were occasionally seen. Colocalization of phosphorylated \u03b1-synuclein and DCTN1 were also observed in Lewy body-like structures in oculomotor nuclei. Phosphorylated TARDBP-positive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions were few.In conjunction with long disease duration and aging, our findings suggest that the F52L DCTN1 mutation may evoke severe tauopathy and moderate \u03b1-synucleinopathy.",

     "abstract": "When Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are asked about the quality of their sleep, their answers are dominated by difficulties associated with impaired mobility in bed, medically referred to as nocturnal hypokinesia. Nocturnal hypokinesia is symptomatic from the mid-stage of the disease, affecting up to 70% of PD patients, and contributes to poor sleep quality, and increased carer burden. Here we explore four areas of nocturnal hypokinesia that are relevant to clinical practice, namely: manifestations and definition; clinical assessment and objective monitoring; etiologies and contributing factors; and evidence-based therapeutic approaches. In addition, we provide an operational definition of what constitutes nocturnal hypokinesia and outline different methods of assessment, ranging from clinical interviews and rating scales to objective night-time monitoring with inertial sensors. Optimal management of nocturnal hypokinesia in PD begins with recognizing its manifestation by inquiring about cardinal symptoms and contributing factors from, not only patients, but also carers, followed by formal assessment, and the application of individualized evidence-based treatment. Night-time dopaminergic treatment is the primary therapy; however, careful clinical judgment is required to balance the benefits with the potential adverse events related to nocturnal dopaminergic stimulation. Future studies are needed to explore the practicality of home-based objective assessment of nocturnal hypokinesia, new therapeutic options not limited to dopaminergic medications, and non-pharmacologic approaches, including training on compensatory strategies and bedroom adaptations.",

PD patients have abnormal aggregation of intestinal \u03b1-synuclein, the accumulation of which may be promoted by inflammation. The relationship between intestinal \u03b1-synuclein aggregates and central nervous system neuropathology is unknown. Recently, we observed a possible inverse association between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and PD as part of a predictive model of PD. Therefore, the objective of this study was to examine the relationship between PD risk and IBD and IBD-associated conditions and treatment.Using a case-control design, we identified 89,790 newly diagnosed PD cases and 118,095 population-based controls >65 years of age using comprehensive Medicare data from 2004-2009 including detailed claims data. We classified IBD using International Classification of Diseases version 9 (ICD-9) diagnosis codes. We used logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the association between PD and IBD. Covariates included age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking, Elixhauser comorbidities, and health care use.PD was inversely associated with IBD overall (OR\u202f=\u202f0.85, 95% CI 0.80\u20130.91) and with both Crohn's disease (OR\u202f=\u202f0.83, 95% CI 0.74\u20130.93) and ulcerative colitis (OR\u202f=\u202f0.88, 95% CI 0.82\u20130.96). Among beneficiaries with \u22652 ICD-9 codes for IBD, there was an inverse dose-response association between number of IBD ICD-9 codes, as a potential proxy for IBD severity, and PD (p-for-trend\u202f=\u202f0.006).IBD is associated with a lower risk of developing PD.",

NMSs were assessed using the Non-Motor Symptom assessment scale (NMSS).Of the 196 patients with PD, 136 (69.3%) were categorized as coffee drinkers and 60 (30.6%) were non-drinkers. Coffee drinkers were younger, predominantly male, were younger in age at symptom onset, had lower Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor and Beck Depression Inventory scores, and higher Mini-Mental State Examination scores than non-coffee drinkers.

Few studies have examined the association between COMT variants and cognition in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).We assessed a cohort of 409 PD patients without dementia who were regularly followed for two years. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were administered at baseline and during the follow-up. The genetic variants and haplotypes of COMT, including rs6267, rs6269, rs4633, rs4818, and rs4680, were examined.No association was observed between COMT genotypes and baseline cognitive function. After a mean follow-up period of 647.3 days, MMSE scores deteriorated with age. Cognitive decline correlated with age (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) but not with the motor severity defined using UPDRS part III scores (P\u202f=\u202f0.21). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analyses showed that PD patients carrying the G allele of the rs6269 variant and COMT haplotypes constituting the G allele of rs6269 showed a significantly more rapid decline in the MMSE scores over the follow-up period (log-rank test, P\u202f<\u202f0.01). Cox proportional regression analysis adjusted for covariates revealed that among patients with PD, those carrying the high-COMT activity haplotype (G_C_C_G for rs6269, rs4633, rs4818, and rs4680) showed a high risk of cognitive decline (hazard ratio\u202f=\u202f3.24; P\u202f=\u202f0.02).Our findings suggest that the high-COMT activity haplotype is associated with cognitive decline in patients with PD.",

     "abstract": "While the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson's Disease (PD) are not yet fully understood, DBS appears to exert a wide range of neurochemical effects on the network level, thought to arise from activation of inhibitory and excitatory pathways. The activity within the primary inhibitory (GABAergic) and excitatory (glutamatergic) neurotransmitter systems may therefore play an important role in the therapeutic efficacy of DBS in PD. The purpose of this study was to investigate abnormalities in GABA-ergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission in PD, and to examine the link between neurotransmitter levels and outcome following DBS.Magnetic resonance spectra were acquired from the pons and basal ganglia in sixteen patients with PD and sixteen matched control participants. GABA and glutamate levels were quantified with LCModel, an automated spectral fitting package. Fourteen patients subsequently underwent DBS, and PD symptoms were evaluated with the MDS-UPDRS at baseline and six months after surgery. The efficacy of DBS treatment was evaluated from the percentage improvement in MDS-UPDRS scores.Basal ganglia GABA levels were significantly higher in PD patients relative to control participants (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), while pontine glutamate\u00a0+\u00a0glutamine (Glx) levels were significantly lower in patients with PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). While GABA levels were not significantly related to outcome post-surgery, basal ganglia glutamate levels emerged as a significant predictor of outcome, suggesting a possible role for glutamatergic neurotransmission in the therapeutic mechanism of DBS.GABAergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission is altered in PD, and glutamatergic activity in particular may influence outcome post-surgery.",

At 1.5 years follow-up, connectivity remained altered in the same regions identified at baseline. The cerebellum showed additional hyperconnectivity within itself and to the caudate nucleus, thalamus and amygdala compared to controls. These differences correlated with UPDRS-III scores. Seed-based connectivity revealed increased involvement of the default mode network with precentral gyrus in patients at follow-up investigation.Resting-state fMRI identified marked disturbances of the overall architecture of connectivity in Parkinson's disease. The noted alterations in cortical motor areas were associated with cerebellar hyperconnectivity in early to moderately advanced stages of Parkinson's disease suggesting ongoing attempts of recovery and compensatory mechanism for affected functions. The potential to identify connectivity alterations in regions related to both motor and attentional functions requires further evaluation as an objective marker to monitor disease progression, and medical, as well as surgical interventions.",

This improvement however did not translate into clinically relevant benefits. Frequency of falls was not reduced. Activities of daily living, quality of life and frontal cognitive functions declined, while mood remained unchanged.Bilateral pedunculopontine nucleus deep brain stimulation in progressive supranuclear palsy generates frequency-dependent effects with improvement of cyclic gait parameters at low frequency and amelioration of hypokinesia at high frequency stimulation. However, these effects do not translate into a clinically important improvement.",

     "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are associated with essential tremor (ET). However, the relationship between cognitive, functional, and motor measures with depressive symptoms in ET is not yet understood.The following measures were cross-sectionally assessed in a group of 223 subjects with ET: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) Scale, the Lawton Independent Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale, a neurologist assessment of tremor severity, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).20% (44) of the subjects met GDS criteria for depression (GDS\u202f\u2265\u202f10). 43% (94) of the subjects showed at least some cognitive impairment (\u226424 on the MoCA), and 15.3% (34) reported significant functional impairment (IADL score\u202f<\u202f7). There was no significant association between GDS score and tremor scale score. The total GDS was negatively associated with the total MoCA score (Spearman's r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.03). The total GDS was also negatively associated with the IADL score (Spearman's r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.19, p\u202f=\u202f0.02), (logistic model odds ratio, OR\u202f=\u202f4.91, p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Over 60% of subjects who were depressed, per GDS cut-off score (\u226510), were not receiving medical treatment for depression.There was a high point prevalence of depressive symptoms in subjects with ET. Self-report depressive symptoms are dissociated from tremor severity. Hence, these data do not support the hypothesis that depression in ET represents a psychological reaction to the tremor. There appears to be a clustering of cognitive, functional, and depressive symptoms in ET. Screening of depression in ET can improve our understanding and treatment of this disorder.",

Cholinergic depletion is known to be severe in DLB, even when dementia severity is mild. The nucleus basalis of Meynert serves as a primary source of cortical acetylcholine, and has a role in facilitating cortical activation and arousal. We sought to determine whether daytime sleepiness at the initial evaluation of patients with DLB was associated with neuronal loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert.Autopsy-confirmed patients who met clinical criteria for probable DLB at their initial evaluation and who were administered the informant-completed Epworth Sleepiness Scale were included in the study (n\u202f=\u202f40). Each patient had a dementia at baseline (80% with mild severity) and two or more features of parkinsonism, visual hallucinations, fluctuations, or probable REM sleep behavior disorder. Quantitative digital pathology of the nucleus basalis of Meynert was performed in the DLB group and in 20 non-DLB autopsy controls.DLB had greater neuronal depletion in the nucleus basalis of Meynert (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001) than pathologic controls. Sleepiness was present in 58% of the DLB group and those with daytime sleepiness had significantly lower neuron counts in the nucleus basalis of Meynert than their non-sleepy counterparts (p\u202f=\u202f0.001). Regression modeling revealed that sleepiness was a stronger predictor of neuronal loss in the nucleus basalis of Meynert than visual hallucinations, fluctuations or dementia severity (p\u202f=\u202f0.003).Excessive daytime sleepiness in early DLB is indicative of a more profound loss of basal forebrain cholinergic integrity.",

The objective of the current study was to investigate whether fecal markers of inflammation and impaired intestinal barrier function corroborate this pathogenic aspect of PD.In a case-control study, we quantitatively analyzed established fecal markers of intestinal inflammation (calprotectin and lactoferrin) and fecal markers of intestinal permeability (alpha-1-antitrypsin and zonulin) in PD patients (n\u202f=\u202f34) and controls (n\u202f=\u202f28, group-matched for age) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The study design controlled for potential confounding factors.Calprotectin, a fecal marker of intestinal inflammation, and two fecal markers of increased intestinal permeability (alpha-1-antitrypsin and zonulin) were significantly elevated in PD patients compared to age-matched controls. Lactoferrin, as a second fecal marker of intestinal inflammation, showed a non-significant trend towards elevated concentrations in PD patients. None of the four fecal markers correlated with disease severity, PD subtype, dopaminergic therapy, or presence of constipation.Fecal markers reflecting intestinal inflammation and increased intestinal permeability have been primarily investigated in inflammatory bowel disease so far. Our data indicate that calprotectin, alpha-1-antitrypsin and zonulin could be useful non-invasive markers in PD as well. Even though these markers are not disease-specific, they corroborate the hypothesis of an intestinal inflammation as contributing factor in the pathogenesis of PD. Further investigations are needed to determine whether calprotectin, alpha-1-antitrypsin and zonulin can be used to define PD subgroups and to monitor the effect of interventions in PD.",

The persistent lack of consensus on clear terminology and inconsistent conceptual definition of VaP formed the impetus for the current expert recommendation report. The updated diagnostic approach intends to provide a comprehensive tool for clinical practice. The preamble for this initiative is that VaP can be diagnosed in individual patients with possible prognostic and therapeutic consequences and therefore should be recognized as a clinical entity. The diagnosis of VaP is based on the presence of clinical parkinsonism, with variable motor and non-motor signs that are corroborated by clinical, anatomic or imaging findings of cerebrovascular disease. Three VaP subtypes are presented: (1) The acute or subacute post-stroke VaP subtype presents with acute or subacute onset of parkinsonism, which is typically asymmetric and responds to dopaminergic drugs; (2) The more frequent insidious onset VaP subtype presents with progressive parkinsonism with prominent postural instability, gait impairment, corticospinal, cerebellar, pseudobulbar, cognitive and urinary symptoms and poor responsiveness to dopaminergic drugs. A higher-level gait disorder occurs frequently as a dominant manifestation in the clinical spectrum of insidious onset VaP, and (3) With the emergence of molecular imaging biomarkers in clinical practice, our diagnostic approach also allows for the recognition of mixed or overlapping syndromes of VaP with Parkinson's disease or other neurodegenerative parkinsonisms. Directions for future research are also discussed.",

Efficacy measures were changes in quality of life, motor and non-motor symptoms, and time with good mobility without troublesome dyskinesias. Safety measures included tolerability, frequency of adverse events, changes in laboratory indices and electrocardiogram.Daily intake of MP was associated with a variable clinical response, especially in terms of tolerability. Seven patients (50%) discontinued MP prematurely due to either gastrointestinal side-effects (n\u202f=\u202f4) or progressive worsening of motor performance (n\u202f=\u202f3), while nobody discontinued during the LD/CD phase.

Patients who dropped out entered a study extension using MP supernatant water (median[IQR], 16 [7\u201320] weeks), which was well tolerated.The overall benefit provided by MP on the clinical outcome was limited by tolerability issues, as one could expect by the relatively rapid switch from LD/CD to levodopa alone in advanced PD.

To better clarify the personality profile in PD we performed a meta-analysis on studies exploring such topic according to both Cloninger's Psychobiological Model (PM) and Big Five Model (BFM)The meta-analysis included 17 studies evaluating the personality in PD patients compared with HS. The outcomes were the dimensions of the temperament and character of the PM and personality traits of BFM. Effect sizes from data reported in the primary studies were computed using Hedges'g unbiased approach. Heterogeneity among the studies and publication bias were assessed. Meta-regressions were conducted with age at evaluation, gender, schooling, and type of personality trait tools as moderators.As for PM, PD patients scored higher on HA and lower on NS than HS. No difference was found on Reward Dependence, Perseverance/Persistence and on character level. As for BFM, higher levels of Neuroticism, but lower levels of Openness and Extraversion were associated with PD.The personality profile in PD is characterized by high Neuroticism and HA, and by low Openness, Extraversion and NS. The personality profile delineated in the present study on PD patients seems to reflect the premorbid one and might contribute to development and persistence of affective disorders.",

Subsequently MRI measurements of the dentatorubrothalamic tract were determined observer-independently by a validated probabilistic infratentorial atlas. The impairment of gait and postural stability was evaluated by a sum-score derived from the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale.Significant mean diffusivity increases, fractional anisotropy decreases and corresponding volume loss were localized in mesencephalic tegmentum, superior cerebellar peduncle, decussation of superior cerebellar peduncle and dentate nucleus in PSP-RS and PSP-P compared to PD and healthy controls. Altered microstructural integrity of the dentatorubrothalamic tract in PSP-RS was significantly more pronounced compared to PSP-P and correlated significantly with the gait and postural stability sum-score. Linear discriminant analysis identified diffusion tensor imaging measures of the dentatorubrothalamic tract and the gait and postural stability sum-score to classify correctly 95.5% of PRP-RS, PSP-P and PD patients.Observer-independent analysis of microstructural integrity within the dentatorubrothalamic tract in combination with assessments of gait and postural stability differentiate PSP-P from PSP-RS and PD in early to moderately advanced stages.",

Apolipoprotein (APOE) genotyping was also performed. A global PiB standard-uptake value ratio (SUVR) was calculated. AV-1451 SUVRs were calculated for a set of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related regions and a set of PSP-related regions. Voxel-level analyses were conducted to assess for differences in AV-1451 uptake patterns and MRI atrophy between PiB(+) and PiB(\u2212) cases compared to 60 normal PiB(\u2212) controls. Statistical testing for correlations and associations between variables of interest were also performed.Twelve subjects (40%) showed beta-amyloid deposition. Higher PiB SUVR correlated with older age but not with AV-1451 SUVR in the AD- or PSP-related regions. Higher AV-1451 SUVR in AD-related regions was associated with higher AV-1451 SUVR in PSP-related regions. We found little evidence for beta-amyloid related differences in clinical metrics, proportion of APOE e4 carriers, pattern of AV-1451 uptake, or pattern of atrophy.Beta-amyloid deposition occurs in a relatively high proportion of PSP subjects.

There is evidence to suggest that altered pain sensitivity may contribute to the experience of pain in PD patients, but clinical studies investigating this have yielded inconsistent results.To examine whether pain thresholds are altered in PD patients compared to normal healthy controls (HC), via the use of systematic review and meta-analysis.A systematic search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE library from 1966 to April 2015.Studies that compared pain thresholds in PD patients versus HC were included in the systematic review. Additionally, data comparing PD patients off dopaminergic medications (PDMoff) to HC off medications (HCMoff) were pooled for meta-analysis by pain modality.Heat pain threshold, cold pain threshold, electrical pain threshold, nociceptive withdrawal reflex threshold, pressure pain threshold, and pain ratings.22 studies were reviewed, comprising of 616 PD and 451 HC. In the comparison of PDMoff versus HCMoff, a large majority of trials (15/19) found reduced pain thresholds (increased pain sensitivity) in PD patients. Meta-analysis of these trials revealed significantly reduced pain thresholds, of moderate to large effect size, in PD patients across all pain modalities. Results were much more heterogenous when PD patients on medications were compared with HC off medications, with most trials reporting no significant difference in pain thresholds between groups. No significant differences were found in pain thresholds for trials that compared PD patients on medications and HC on medications.PD patients are more sensitive to noxious stimuli compared to HC when tested in the off medication state. This increase in pain sensitivity is observed across all modalities, but is not as apparent when PD patients are administered Levodopa, suggesting that dopamine deficient states may contribute to hyperalgesia. However, it remains to be seen whether or not increased pain sensitivity translates clinically into increased prevalence of pain. Similarly, it is unclear if dopaminergic medications influence pain sensitivity. Performing a meta-analysis on studies comparing pain thresholds in PD patients with and without pain, and on and off dopaminergic medications, may draw more definitive conclusions in this regard.",

In Turkey, the role of LRRK2 in Parkinson's disease has been studied fragmentarily, and the incidence of SNCA copy number variations is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency of LRRK2 and SNCA mutations in autosomal dominant PD in Turkey.We performed Sanger sequencing of all coding LRRK2 and SNCA exons in a sample of 91 patients with Parkinsonism. Copy number variations in SNCA, PRKN, PINK1, DJ1 and ATP13A2 were assessed using the MLPA method. All patients had a positive family history compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance.Known mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA were found in 3.3% of cases: one patient harbored the LRRK2 G2019S mutation, and two patients carried a SNCA gene duplication. Furthermore, we found a heterozygous deletion of PRKN exon 2 in one patient, and four rare coding variants of unknown significance (LRRK2: A211V, R1067Q, T2494I; SNCA: T72T). Genetic testing in one affected family identified the LRRK2 R1067Q variant as a possibly pathogenic substitution.Point mutations in LRRK2 and SNCA are a rare cause of autosomal dominant PD in Turkey.

     "abstract": "Declines in simultaneous performance of a cognitive and motor task are present in Parkinson's disease due to compromised basal ganglia function related to information processing. The aim of this project was to determine if biomechanical measures of arm swing could be used as a marker of gait function under dual-task conditions in Parkinson's disease patients.Twenty-three patients with Parkinson's disease completed single and dual-task cognitive-motor tests while walking on a treadmill at a self-selected rate. Multiple cognitive domains were evaluated with five cognitive tests. Cognitive tests were completed in isolation (single-task) and simultaneously with gait (dual-task). Upper extremity biomechanical data were gathered using the Motek CAREN system. Primary outcomes characterizing arm swing were: path length, normalized jerk, coefficient of variation of arm swing time, and cognitive performance.Performance on the cognitive tasks were similar across single and dual-task conditions. However, biomechanical measures exhibited significant changes between single and dual-task conditions, with the greatest changes occurring in the most challenging conditions. Arm swing path length decreased significantly from single to dual-task, with the greatest decrease of 21.16%. Jerk, characterizing smoothness, increased significantly when moving from single to dual-task conditions.The simultaneous performance of a cognitive and gait task resulted in decrements in arm swing while cognitive performance was maintained. Arm swing outcomes provide a sensitive measure of declines in gait function in Parkinson's disease under dual-task conditions. The quantification of arm swing is a feasible approach to identifying and evaluating gait related declines under dual-task conditions.",

Many factors are reported to be associated with dyskinesia in PD.To investigate the association between sleep quality and dyskinesia in patients with PD.Four hundred twenty-five patients with PD were enrolled in this study. Demographic information was collected. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and Hoehn and Yahr (H-Y) stage scale were also performed. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were applied to evaluate daytime sleepiness and overall nighttime sleep quality, respectively, in PD patients.Patients with dyskinesia tended to have a longer duration of disease, higher daily levodopa-equivalent dose (LED), H-Y stage, UPDRS II and PSQI score, and a higher percentage of levodopa treatment than those without dyskinesia. After adjusting for age, sex, age at onset of PD, disease duration, UPDRS I, UPDRS II, UPDRS III, cigarette smoking, use of different antiparkinsonian drugs, phenotype, daily LED, and restless leg syndrome (RLS), PSQI score was still associated with dyskinesia, with corresponding ORs 1.111 (95% CI, 1.004\u20131.229) as a continuous variable, and 2.469 (95% CI, 1.051\u20135.800) as a categorical variable, respectively. Further analysis of PSQI components showed that subjective sleep quality and sleep latency were associated with dyskinesia in PD patients.Our data showed that poor nighttime sleep is positively associated with dyskinesia in PD patients. Attention to the management of nighttime sleep quality may be beneficial to dyskinesia in patients with PD.",

Nine stepwise regression models were calculated, with consecutive outcome variables: Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ) Summary Index (SI), PDQ-Mobility, PDQ-Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Demographic variables, disease-specific features, and quantitative physical activity parameters, were included as predicting variables in all analyses.

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a growing concern as the longevity of the world's population steadily increases. Both ageing and Parkinson's disease have an impact on dopamine neurotransmission. It is therefore important to investigate their relative impact on the fronto-striatal reward system. There has been little investigation of reward processing in terms of anticipation and reward outcome in Parkinson's disease. Abnormal responses during reward processing have previously been demonstrated in whole-brain analysis of Parkinson's patients with mild lateralized disease, but the exact impact in regions specific to reward processing is still unknown.Here we aim to investigate the impact of Parkinson's disease on the orbitofrontal ventral striatal reward system in patients with moderate to severe clinical symptoms.We utilized a monetary incentive delay (MID) task in 17 Parkinson's patients who were compared to two control groups stratified by age. The MID paradigm reliably activates the ventral striatum during reward anticipation and the orbitofrontal cortex during reward outcome processing.Relative to the two control groups, Parkinson's disease patients had abnormal task related activity during both reward anticipation in the ventral striatum and reward outcome in the orbitofrontal cortex. There were no effects of ageing.These findings demonstrate abnormalities in anticipatory as well as reward outcome processing while treated primarily with levodopa. The orbitofrontal dysfunction during reward outcome processing may have specificity in Parkinson's disease, as it has been shown to be relatively unaffected by normal ageing.",

The frequency of novel missense variants was investigated in healthy Brazilian controls and in public databases. Homozygosity in the PRKRA region was assessed through polymorphic markers.PRKRA variants were identified in seven probands with isolated dystonia, including a novel c.C795A variant in compound heterozygosity with the previously described c.C665T variant. Heterozygosity in the gene region was observed in two probands who were homozygous for c.C665T, indicating that this mutation originated from independent events, suggesting a hotspot.PRKRA is not an unusual cause of idiopathic dystonia. In this cohort, it was responsible for 4.5% of the total of cases (4.9% of the isolated dystonia cases). The most common phenotype was early-onset isolated focal dystonia followed by generalization, parkinsonism was not observed. This is first report of PRKRA causing adulthood-onset dystonia.

Each record was reviewed to confirm chorea/ballism. From these cases we selected those that developed chorea/ballism within a month after a hyperglycemic episode (blood glucose >300\u202fmg/dL). Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were analyzed.Of the 596 chorea cases, we identified 7 patients (5 women) whose chorea was preceded by a hyperglycemic episode (range 3\u201330 days) during 15 years of surveillance, including new-onset diabetes in four cases. Median age was 80 years (range, 53\u201386). The chorea/ballism was unilateral in 6/7 cases and half of these unilateral cases had contralateral putamen T1-hyperintensity on brain MRI. After glucose correction, the chorea resolved within one week without recurrence in only one case. Among the 6 cases with persistent chorea, it was controlled with dopamine blocking/depleting medications.Chorea triggered by hyperglycemia is a rare complication of diabetes, with only seven cases identified at our tertiary medical center during 15 years of surveillance. This comprised about 1% of all chorea cases at our center during this time. Hyperglycemic chorea primarily developed in later life, with new-onset diabetes in the majority (4/7). Although MRI putamen T1-hyperintensity is reportedly typical, it was only seen in 3/6 cases. This MRI appearance may be mistaken for a hemorrhagic stroke, given the usual unilateral presentation.

Analyses examined if participants in the Reversion group were at greater risk, relative to the CI-Stable group, for cognitive impairment at future assessments.Participants in the Reversion group were at greater risk for future cognitive impairment (PD-MCI or PDD) at the 2nd, 3rd and 4th annual follow-up, relative to the CI-Stable group. The Reversion group continued to be at increased risk for future cognitive impairment when adjusting for age, gender, education, depressive symptoms, and motor severity.A large proportion of individuals with PD-MCI will not show evidence of cognitive impairment within a year.

The effectiveness of DBS in reducing tremors that develop after a structural lesion of the central nervous system (such as Holmes' tremor \u2013 HT) has only been addressed in case reports or series.We conducted a systematic review of all published original reports of DBS in central nervous system lesion-related tremor (excluding demyelinating disorders due to their non-static nature). Where available, we extracted data regarding each patient's demographic, tremor and surgical details. Improvement was calculated as a percentage of change in any objective tremor rating scale.We identified 35 publications reporting on 82 patients. The ventral intermedius nucleus(VIM) of the thalamus was the preferred target (63.6%) and 18.2% targeted globus pallidus pars interna(GPi). Median improvement was 77.5% and 71.4% for patients with post-stroke and post-traumatic tremor respectively. Seven subjects (13.5%) had less than 50% improvement. Therapeutic effectiveness was not associated with age, tremor duration, age of onset or follow-up time. A large range of stimulation parameters were used with median voltage, pulse width and frequency values higher for GPi (4.80\u202fV, 105 us, 170\u202fHz) than for thalamic stimulation (3.0\u202fV, 90 us, 140\u202fHz).DBS reports for Holmes' and lesional tremors treatment are scarce and highly heterogeneous limiting a proper summary analysis and comparisons. Even facing a probable report bias, a high number of subjects with good long-term tremor control were found. These results should promote the creation of tremor registries before clinical trials.",

Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to measure diagnostic power. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was performed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy.The model to discriminate APS from LBD showed that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.923, while the total diagnostic accuracy (TDA) was 86.1% in LOOCV. In the model to distinguish PSP, CBS, and MSA from LBD, the AUC/TDA values were 0.978/94.6%, 0.978/87.0%, and 0.880/80.3%, respectively.

Gait speed and five times sit to stand were normal in OT.Common validated balance scales are significantly abnormal in primary OT. Despite the objective finding of impaired balance, OT patients do not commonly have falls. The reported sensation of unsteadiness in this patient population seems to be out of proportion to the number of actual falls. Further studies are needed to determine which components of commonly used balance scales are affected by a sensation of unsteadiness and fear of falling.",

We calculated risk ratios using Poisson regression with robust error variance.There was no difference in dyskinesia prevalence among carriers of various haplotypes in DRD1. However, one haplotype in each DRD2 haploblocks was associated with a 29 to 50% increase in dyskinesia risk. For each unit increase in risk score, we observed a 16% increase in dyskinesia risk for DRD2 (95%CI: 1.05\u20131.29) and a 17% (95%CI: 0.99\u20131.40) increase for DRD3.

     "abstract": "Dopaminergic therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) can be associated with both motoric (e.g., dyskinesias) and neuropsychiatric adverse effects. Examples of the latter include Dopamine Dysregulation Syndrome (DDS) and impulse control disorder (ICD), which are separate but related behavioral/psychiatric complications of treatment in PD. Dysregulation of volition characterizes both dyskinesias and DDS/ICD; thus, we analyzed potential disease-related correlates in a large PD cohort.We analyzed cross-sectional data from 654 participants collected through the NINDS Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program. DDS/ICD symptoms and dyskinesias were assessed using the Movement Disorders Society (revised) Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Potential associated variables were selected from PD-validated or PD-specific scales of neuropsychiatric or motoric status. Multivariable models with DDS/ICD or dyskinesia presence outcomes were produced with backward stepwise regression to identify factors independently associated with DDS/ICD and/or dyskinesias.Fifty-three (8.1%) participants endorsed DDS and/or ICD symptoms and 150 (22.9%) were dyskinetic. In multivariable analysis, psychosis was independently associated with both dyskinesias (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and DDS/ICD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Unpredictable motor fluctuations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) and depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) were also associated with DDS/ICD; female sex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), low tremor score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and high akinesia-rigidity score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were associated with dyskinesias.Our findings suggest that psychosis may be an important marker of impaired volition across motor and cognitive domains. Unpredictable motor fluctuations, psychosis, and depression may together comprise a phenotypic profile of patients at increased risk for DDS/ICD. Similarly, dyskinetic PD patients should be closely monitored for psychotic symptoms and treated appropriately.",

Feature selection is used to find the most important features for classification. We also exploit a graph-based technique on the set of quantitative markers to extract additional features from the dataset, and increase classification accuracy.When graph-based features are not used, the MR markers that are most frequently automatically extracted by the feature selection procedure reflect alterations in brain regions that are also usually considered to discriminate parkinsonisms in routine clinical practice. Graph-derived features typically increase the diagnostic accuracy, and reduce the number of features required.The results obtained in the work demonstrate that support vector machines applied to multimodal brain MR imaging and using graph-based features represent a novel and highly accurate approach to discriminate parkinsonisms, and a useful tool to assist the diagnosis.",

Here, we present a case report about a Chinese patient presenting with juvenile-onset parkinsonism likely caused by FBXO7 mutations.The patient was a 32-year-old Chinese male. DNA samples were extracted from the patient and his parents. Exons in parkinsonism-related genes were amplified and sequenced.The patient began experiencing a progressive involuntary tremor in his left hand at 16 years of age, which was followed by the development of gait dysfunction, dysarthria, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder. A neurological examination of the patient revealed cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, static and postural tremor and bilateral Babinski signs. The patient responded to dopaminergic therapies but was affected by psychiatric side effects.

We hypothesized that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is reliable to assess reductions in coenzyme Q10 as a candidate biomarker of MSA.In this preliminary cross-sectional study we assessed CSF coenzyme Q10 levels in 20 patients with MSA from the multicenter Catalan MSA Registry and of 15 PD patients, 10 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and 15 control subjects from the Movement Disorders Unit Biosample Collection of Hospital Clinic de Barcelona. A specific ELISA kit was used to determine CSF coenzyme Q10 levels. CSF coenzyme Q10 levels were compared in MSA vs. the other groups globally, pair-wise, and by binary logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, disease severity, disease duration, and dopaminergic treatment.CSF coenzyme Q10 levels were significantly lower in MSA than in other groups in global and pair-wise comparisons, as well as in multivariate regression models. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses yielded significant areas under the curve for MSA vs. PD, PSP and controls.These findings support coenzyme Q10 relevance in MSA. Low CSF coenzyme Q10 levels deserve further consideration as a biomarker of MSA.",

A prospective cohort of patients with PSP (n\u00a0=\u00a023), PD (n\u00a0=\u00a040) and MSA (n\u00a0=\u00a022) was exploited as a second test-set.The pons-to-midbrain diameter ratio, the midbrain diameter, the middle cerebellar peduncle width and the pons area were identified as the most predictive parameters to separate PSP, MSA and PD in C4.5 decision tree models derived from the training set. Using these decision models, AUCs in discriminating PSP, MSA and PD were 0.90, 0.57 and 0.73 in the CUP-cohort and 0.95, 0.61 and 0.87 in the prospective cohort, respectively.We were able to demonstrate that brainstem-derived MR planimetric measures yield high diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of PSP from related disorders when decision tree algorithms are applied, even at early, clinically uncertain stages. However, their diagnostic accuracy in discriminating PD and MSA was suboptimal.",

Investigating the association between specific motor signs and different regional volumes is important to understand the heterogeneity of HD.To investigate the motor phenotype of HD and associations with subcortical and cortical grey matter volume loss.Structural T1-weighted MRI scans of 79 HD patients and 30 healthy controls were used to calculate volumes of seven subcortical structures including the nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, thalamus, caudate nucleus, putamen, pallidum and amygdala. Multiple linear regression analyses, corrected for age, gender, CAG, MRI scan protocol and normalized brain volume, were performed to assess the relationship between subcortical volumes and different motor subdomains (i.e. eye movements, chorea, dystonia, hypokinesia/rigidity and gait/balance). Voxel-based morphometry analysis was used to investigate the relationship between cortical volume changes and motor signs.Subcortical volume loss of the accumbens nucleus, caudate nucleus, putamen, and pallidum were associated with higher chorea scores. No other subcortical region was significantly associated with motor symptoms after correction for multiple comparisons. Voxel-based cortical grey matter volume reductions in occipital regions were related with an increase in eye movement scores.In HD, chorea is mainly associated with subcortical volume loss, while eye movements are more related to cortical volume loss. Both subcortical and cortical degeneration has an impact on motor impairment in HD. This implies that there is a widespread contribution of different brain regions resulting in the clinical motor presentation seen in HD patients.",

Cross-sectional correlational studies have established a relationship between the degree of atrophy in posterior brain regions and visuospatial and visuoperceptual (VS/VP) impairment. The aim of this study is to address the progressive cortical thinning correlates of VS/VP performance in PD.Forty-four PD patients and 20 matched healthy subjects were included in this study and followed for 4 years. Tests used to assess VS/VP functions included were: Benton's Judgement of Line Orientation (JLOT), Facial Recognition (FRT), and Visual Form Discrimination (VFDT) Tests; Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT); and the Pentagon Copying Test (PCT). Structural magnetic resonance imaging data and FreeSurfer were used to evaluate cortical thinning evolution.PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC) and PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) differed significantly in the progression of cortical thinning in posterior regions. In PD-MCI patients, the change in VS/VP functions assessed by PCT, JLOT, FRT, and SMDT correlated with the symmetrized percent change of cortical thinning of occipital, parietal, and temporal regions. In PD-NC patients, we also observed a correlation between changes in FRT and thinning in parieto-occipital regions.In this study, we establish the neuroanatomical substrate of progressive changes in VS/VP performance in PD patients with and without MCI. In agreement with cross-sectional data, VS/VP changes over time are related to cortical thinning in posterior regions.",

This study examined the relationship between olfactory dysfunction and cognitive function in drug-na\u00efve PD at the time of diagnosis with the patterns of olfactory function in PD-MCI patients using the Korean version of the Sniffin\u2019 stick test II (KVSS II).A total of 66 drug-na\u00efve PD patients were enrolled. A neuropsychiatric assessment battery and KVSS II were performed. For the statistical analyses, univariate, multivariable linear regression and Student's t-test were used to determine the relationship between the variables and olfactory function.Olfactory dysfunction was more prevalent in the PD-MCI group than in the PD-normal cognition (PD-CN) group. Each domains of odor threshold, discrimination, identification and total olfactory score were more impaired in the PD-MCI group than the PD-CN group. Whether cognitive impairment was single or multiple domain was not affected.PD-MCI is more likely to be associated with severe olfactory impairment than PD-CN. There may be more extensive neurodegenerative processes affecting olfaction in PD-MCI patients. With further investigation and validation using neuropathological data, an objective olfactory function test could be used as a tool to evaluate disease progression. Further studies with prospective design investigating the prognostic value of olfactory dysfunction in PD-MCI patients are essential.",

Zebrafish models of COL6A3 mutations showed deficits in axonal targeting mechanisms. Therefore, COL6A3 mutations have been considered to contribute to irregular sensorimotor circuit formation. To test this hypothesis, we examined structural abnormalities in cerebral fiber tracts of dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations using diffusion tensor imaging.We performed a voxel-wise statistical analysis to compare fractional anisotropy within whole-brain white matter in four of the previously reported dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations and 12 healthy controls. Region of interests-based probabilistic tractography was performed as a post-hoc-analysis.Dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations showed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy bilaterally in midbrain, pons, cerebellar peduncles, thalamus, internal capsule and in frontal and parietal subcortical regions compared to healthy controls. Tractography revealed a decreased fractional anisotropy in patients with COL6A3-associated dystonia between bilateral dentate nucleus and thalamus.Diffusion tensor imaging demonstrates an altered white matter structure especially in various parts of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network in dystonia patients with COL6A3 mutations. This suggests that COL6A3 mutations could contribute to abnormal circuit formation as potential basis of dystonia.",

Previous studies demonstrated different molecular pathogenesis in SPG31, including loss-of-function, gain-of-function and haploinsufficiency. A four-generation family from Japan, including 12 members, was investigated clinically and genetically. Seven affected members displayed pure spastic paraplegia.

Genetic analysis revealed a heterozygous intronic variant, c.303+2T\u00a0>\u00a0A, in REEP1, which segregated with disease, and was also identified in one unaffected member. The variant causes exon 4 skipping leading to frame shift and a truncated transcript identified by complementary DNA sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction products.

     "abstract": "It took almost 100 years before a meaningful advance occurred in any basic science understanding of Parkinson disease (PD) following James Parkinson's description in 1817. The Lewy body was described in 1912, and the substantia nigra was found to be depigmented with neuronal loss and gliosis in 1919. The link between dopamine and PD began in 1957, 140 years after Parkinson's Essay. Arvid Carlsson and Oleh Hornykiewicz were the major pioneers. The revolutionary therapeutic breakthrough was the introduction of high dosage levodopa therapy by George Cotzias in 1967.Following 40 years of the dopa/dopamine era, we have entered the era of alpha-synuclein, the protein present in Lewy bodies. Heiko Braak found that alpha-synuclein accumulates initially in the olfactory system and lower brainstem and then travels in an anatomic pattern to involve other regions of the brain and thereby cause progressive symptoms. Alpha-synuclein was somehow converted to a rogue protein. Where this originates and how it is propagated are under intense investigation.At the same time that the alpha-synuclein era was developing, clinical advances took place by recognizing PD as hosting a wide variety of nonmotor features with eventual cognitive impairment in many. Therapeutics has also evolved. Although the most effective therapy for the motor features remains levodopa, surgical approaches and drugs for nonmotor problems continue to expand our ability to treat people with PD. We can expect therapeutic advances in neuroprotection as the basic science discoveries uncovered in the alpha-synuclein era are translated into effective treatments.",

Risk factors associated with the development of ICDs in PD were systematically evaluated, confirming the correlation between these disorders and male gender, younger age at PD onset and family history for addiction.We will discuss the recent advances on the functional neuroanatomy, the role of dopamine-serotonin interactions and the cognitive profile associated with ICDs.

Molecular pathology of PD is summarized from cell biological and animal studies.The pathologic feature that correlates with signs and symptoms of PD is neuronal loss in the substantia nigra with dopaminergic denervation of the striatum. Neuronal degeneration in the substantia nigra preferentially affects the ventrolateral cell group that projects to posterolateral putamen and is accompanied by formation of Lewy bodies composed of aggregated \u03b1-synuclein. Some patients with PD are found at autopsy to have other pathologic processes, such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and cerebrovascular disease (vascular Parkinsonism). The peripheral autonomic nervous system is also affected. The triggering event in PD is unknown, but recent studies suggest a role for loss of nuclear membrane integrity. Once \u03b1-synuclein aggregates forms, evidence supports cell-to-cell propagation.PD is a multisystem synucleinopathy caused by poorly characterized genetic and environmental factors that produces degeneration in selectively vulnerable neuronal populations.",

ALSP is a subtype of dominantly inherited leukoencephalopathy caused by CSF1R mutations. ALSP typically develop in adulthood, with cognitive decline, psychiatric symptoms, and motor symptoms of movement disorders. Cognitive symptoms in ALSP are characterized by frontal lobe dysfunctions such as executive dysfunction, attention deficits and indifference. The cardinal motor symptoms of movement disorders ALSP were gait disturbance and bradykinesia, which may appear as the initial symptoms.

     "abstract": "Dystonia is a rare disorder that has undergone extensive scientific investigation leading to a transformation of understanding over the past century.This manuscript was prepared through a review of relevant literature for each topic.Historically dystonia was considered the manifestation of psychiatric disorders. Subsequently, investigations have firmly established this as a neurological disorder. Though electrophysiological and imaging, dystonia is thought to arise from a loss inhibition of motor programs, defective sensorimotor integration and abnormal plasticity. The genetic studies in dystonia have revealed the hereditary nature of many forms of familial dystonia. Treatment of dystonia has focused primarily on botulinum toxin for focal and segmental dystonia and deep brain stimulation of the globus pallidus interna for generalized and medically refractory focal dystonia.The progress in dystonia in the past century has revised the concepts of this disorder, increased knowledge of genetics and underlying pathophysiology, and provides new therapeutic targets. To promote future research the development of diagnostic criteria, biomarkers and validated rating scales for each form of dystonia is essential.",

In this \u201cthen\u201d and \u201cnow\u201d piece, I detail how views of this disorder have changed over time.A PubMed search was conducted on June 15, 2017. The term \u201cessential tremor\u201d was crossed in sequential order with 14\u00a0s search terms (e.g., genetics, clinical).The traditional view of ET was that it was monosymptomatic. An emerging view of ET is as a more clinically-complex entity with a range of possible motor and non-motor features. Traditionally, ET was viewed as autosomal dominant with complete penetrance by age 65. Current thinking is that, in addition to monogenic forms of ET, the disease is likely to be complex, with incomplete penetrance into advanced age. While non-genetic factors were traditionally presumed to exist, epidemiological studies have explored several potential environmental toxicants. The traditional olivary model of ET posited the existence of a central oscillator; an alternative is the cerebellar degenerative model, which is now under consideration.For ET, there is clearly a \u201cthen\u201d and \u201cnow\u201d when one assesses changes in our understanding of the disease with time. Indeed, concepts relating to the clinical features, disease etiology and pathogenesis have all changed substantially.",

     "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a common neuropsychiatric disorder, more common in males than females, with onset before age 18. TS is characterized by multiple motor tics and one or more vocal/phonic tics, persisting for more than a year. Tics are unvoluntary, abrupt, rapid, repetitive, but non-rhythmic movements or sounds (vocalizations). They are preceded by an inner urge. Tics can be temporarily suppressed, but this leads to a powerful re-emergence. The performance of tics results in immediate but transient relief.Motor and vocal tics are classified as simple or complex. Tics emerge many times during the day and display spontaneous fluctuations in frequency, type, severity and complexity. Tics improve during concentration, worsen during relaxation or when under stress and occasionally are persistent in sleep. Psychiatric comorbidities such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and others frequently are present.Patients, families and teachers benefit from receiving instruction regarding the character of TS and its specific symptoms and from receiving counseling. Pharmacological treatment is not always necessary. Atypical antipsychotics (e.g. risperidone, ziprasidone, olanzapine, aripiprazole) are often the first-line treatment; typical antipsychotics (e.g. haloperidol, pimozide, fluphenazine), benzodiazepines (clonazepam) and tetrabenazine are employed less frequently. Alpha adrenergic agonists (clonidine, guanfacine), the selective noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor, atomoxetine, and the amphetamine-like stimulant, methylphenidate, are useful in patients with tics and ADHD; selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors can be useful in individuals with tics and OCD. Botulinum toxin can be effective in focal tics. In severe, treatment-resistant TS, deep brain stimulation may be beneficial.",

A number of movement disorders can develop in adults and children in response to infections. These can occur in isolation or as part of a broader neurological illness, with movement abnormalities consequent to an encephalopathy or a broader brain dysfunction. While most infection-related movement disorders are direct consequences of an active infectious process affecting cerebral structures implied in the motor network, at times a delayed immune-mediated process in response to a previous infectious is responsible for the neurological dysfunction. This immunological response can occur as a consequence of a number of pathogens, and develop at variable times after the initial infection. The most common infection-mediated autoimmune movement disorders are chorea, which is especially common in children, and other hyperkinetic disorders, but Parkinsonism and other hypokinetic movement disorders may also occur.",

How much in the way of \u201ccerebellar signs\u201d are acceptable? Are non-motor features due to the underlying disease or merely secondary to the clinical features? Is ET a single disease entity or something else?We are learning more about ET and, as a by-product of these efforts, are struggling with its definition. Further understanding the nature of the underlying disease pathogenesis as well as the role the cerebellum and cerebellar relays play in this process will likely provide important clues to enable us to bring order to areas of uncertainty.",

Here we review the pathophysiology (cerebral mechanisms) and etiology (genetic and environmental risk factors) of ET.We reviewed the literature (until June 2017) by searching PubMed for relevant papers.The pathophysiology of ET involves oscillatory activity in the cortico-olivo-cerebello-thalamic circuit, evidenced by electrophysiological and metabolic imaging. Possible underlying mechanisms include GABA-ergic dysfunction, cerebellar neurodegeneration, olivary dysfunction, or a combination. Genetic studies have examined affected ET families (linkage studies and whole-exome sequencing studies). These studies revealed several chromosomal regions and genes associated with ET, but the findings have not been replicated across different ET families. Genetic studies also assessed the sporadic occurrence of ET using genome wide genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP's) and candidate gene studies. Several SNP's are associated with ET, and this has been replicated across different cohorts. Interestingly, some of the involved genes are linked to the cerebellum and inferior olive. Environmental studies point to an association between ET and beta-carboline alkaloids (such as harmane), which have been found in the cerebellum.Genetic and environmental risk factors may influence cerebellar and/or olivary function, resulting in abnormal cortico-olivo-cerebello-thalamic activity, and ultimately ET.",

     "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic process that is involved in cellular homeostasis and stress responses. Although basal levels of autophagy are essential for cellular homeostasis, dysregulated autophagy is linked to neurodegeneration. Recent studies using genetic or neurotoxin-based models of Parkinson's disease (PD) detect autophagy. We demonstrate that neurotoxins induce autophagy in dopaminergic neuronal cell line and primary cultured neurons. Based on previous reports, including ones from our laboratory, which show that elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytosolic calcium are implicated in dopaminergic neurodegeneration, we reasoned that these triggers may play critical roles in determining dysregulated autophagy. Similarly, we have demonstrated that ROS-mediated signals play an essential role in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced apoptosis, whereas MPP+ causes elevations in cytosolic calcium and calpain activation. By using these experimental models, we specifically address the question as to whether an increase in ROS or cytosolic calcium governs abnormal flux of autophagy as well as the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). So far, our data support a notion that ROS and cytosolic calcium act on a distinct flux of autophagy and the UPS. Our data also raise the possibility of interplay between autophagy and other cell death modes (e.g., caspase- or calpain-dependent cell death) during dopaminergic neurodegeneration.",

This exercise follows the new advances in the field of tremor from both a pathophysiological and nosological perspective.Dividing ET patients into early onset and late onset disease subtypes can prove useful in ascertaining the phenotypic, epidemiological and genetic characteristics defining its relationships to PD. The only way to ascertain whether ET increases the risk of future PD would be to conduct a longitudinal cohort study on early-onset ET patients. On the other hand, ET-plus patients or late-onset cases with ET of short-duration might represent a group of PD patients in their pre-diagnostic phase after the pre-motor stage.In spite of the growing body of literature in recent years of an overlap between ET and PD, we are far from elucidating the relationship (if any) between these two common disorders.",

Here we characterized binocular diplopia in non-demented PD patients in an interdisciplinary setting.PD patients were prospectively screened for diplopia, visual hallucinations, problems with spatial perception, contrast sensitivity, presence of blurred vision, and history of ophthalmological comorbidities via interview. Two groups of PD patients, one with and one without diplopia, underwent clinical and ophthalmological assessment to characterize diplopia in these patients. Clinical features were investigated using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale.The frequency of binocular diplopia was 29.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a037) in our cohort of 125 Parkinson's disease patients. Related mechanisms were heterogeneous including convergence insufficiency, strabismus, and motor fluctuations, as well as symptoms related to visual hallucinations. Diplopia was associated with other visual disturbances like visual hallucinations, blurred vision and problems with spatial perception. Beyond that, diplopia was found to be a predictive factor (3.2, odds ratio) for the occurrence of visual hallucinations in PD.Binocular diplopia represents a frequent and relevant symptom in PD patients. Different subtypes should be considered due to different associated mechanisms including ophthalmic pathology and motor fluctuation, as well as intermediate to higher level visual processes. Diplopia seems to be part of a continuous spectrum of positive visual symptoms in Parkinson's disease.",

Graph-theoretical analysis and network-based statistics, with age and gender as nuisance covariates, were used.Compared with HCs and dPDs, proPD patients showed significantly elevated small-worldness and clustering coefficient (Ps\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and greater local connectivity between regions relating to motor, olfactory and sleep functions (Ps\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The connectivity strength between these regions significantly distinguished between diagnostic groups. Connectivity between bilateral SMAs was correlated with UPSIT in HCs and with UPDRS-III in dPDs. Connectivity between the right SMA and putamen was correlated RBDSQ in proPDs.Increased network efficiency and connectivity of proPDs and decreased local connectivity of dPDs might suggest the emergence and dissipation of neural compensation in the prodromal phase and in early PD, respectively.

After adjustment for disease duration and age at examination, correlations between regional brain R2* values and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total motor scores or subscores for bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, or axial motor deficits were investigated.Compared to controls, patients with PSP had significantly higher R2* values in all of the five brain regions. UPDRS total motor scores and subscores for bradykinesia and axial motor deficits did not correlate with R2* values of the five brain regions. However, UPDRS subscores for unilateral rigidity were correlated with R2* values of the contralateral putamen and GP. In addition, unilateral UPDRS subscores for tremor were associated with R2* values of the ipsilateral dentate nucleus, contralateral putamen, GP, and SN.In PSP, excessive iron accumulation occurs in motor-related subcortical regions. Iron-related PSP pathologies in the lenticular nucleus are associated with rigidity severity, while those in the nigro-striato-pallidal unit and dentate nucleus are associated with tremor severity. Bradykinesia and axial motor deficits of PSP seem to be associated with widespread pathologies in the cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, as well as the basal ganglia.",

We estimated odds ratios(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals(CI) by fitting adjusted multivariable unconditional logistic regression models.Among lifelong non-smokers, passive smoke exposure combined across all settings and accumulated over a lifetime was not associated with PD risk (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.18, 95% CI 0.60, 2.30). Workplace exposure was also not associated with risk. Household exposure during adulthood but not childhood was inversely associated with PD (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.59, 95% CI 0.40, 0.87).

These contradictory results may be attributable to chance due to multiple comparisons in subgroup analyses. No pattern emerged to suggest that increasing years of passive smoke exposure, smokiness of the setting, or combined smokiness by exposure years was associated with lower PD risk.Results do not convincingly support a protective effect of passive smoking in PD.",

     "abstract": "The two main variants of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS) and PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P), share motor and non-motor features with Parkinson's disease (PD) particularly in the early stages. This makes the precocious diagnosis more challenging. We aimed at defining qualitative and quantitative differences of neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological profiles between PSP-P, PSP-RS and PD patients recruited within 24 months after the onset of symptoms, in order to clarify if the identification of peculiar cognitive and psychiatric symptoms is of help for early PSP diagnosis.PD (n\u00a0=\u00a0155), PSP-P (n\u00a0=\u00a011) and PSP-RS (n\u00a0=\u00a014) patients were identified. All patients were submitted to clinical, neurological, neuropsychiatric diagnostic evaluation and to a comprehensive neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological battery. Predictors of PSP-P and PSP-RS diagnosis were identified by multivariate logistic regressions including neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological features that differed significantly among groups.The three groups differed significantly at the Apathy Rating Scale score and at several neuropsychological domains. The multivariate logistic regressions indicated that the diagnosis of PSP-RS was predicted by phonological verbal fluency deficit whereas the presence of apathy significantly predicted the PSP-P diagnosis.Peculiar neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological symptoms are identifiable very precociously in PSP-P, PSP-RS and PD patients. Early phonological verbal fluency deficit identifies patients with PSP-RS whereas apathy supports the diagnosis of PSP-P.",

     "abstract": "In patients with GTP-cyclohydrolase deficient dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) the occurrence of associated non-motor symptoms (NMS) is to be expected. Earlier studies report conflicting results with regard to the nature and severity of NMS. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, sleep problems, fatigue and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in a Dutch DRD cohort.Clinical characteristics, motor symptoms, type and severity of psychiatric co-morbidity, sleep problems, fatigue and HR-QoL were assessed in DRD patients with a confirmed GCH1 mutation and matched controls.Twenty-eight patients were included (18 adults and 10 children), from 10 families. Dystonia symptoms were well-controlled in all patients. According to the DSM IV patients significantly more often met the criteria for a lifetime psychiatric disorder than controls (61% vs. 29%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In particular the frequencies of generalized anxiety and agoraphobia were higher in patients (both 29% vs. 4%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Patients scored significantly higher on daytime sleepiness than controls (ESS, 11.2 vs 5.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Adult patients had significantly lower scores on the mental component of the HR-QoL (47 vs. 54, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than controls mainly associated with (worse) quality of sleep.NMS were highly prevalent in our cohort of DRD patients, despite adequate treatment of motor symptoms. Our findings support the accumulating evidence of an important non-motor phenotype in DRD, with possible involvement of serotonergic mechanisms. This highlights the need to address NMS and the underlying neurobiology in patients with DRD.",

The objective of this study was to determine prevalence and motor, behavioural, and cognitive correlates of distressing fatigue in early, de novo PD patients.Eighty-one consecutive de novo PD patients (64% men; mean age 65.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.26 years) underwent a comprehensive examination, including Parkinson's disease Fatigue Scale (PFS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Parkinson's Anxiety Scale (PAS), and Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Moreover, all patients underwent a detailed neuropsychological evaluation exploring attention and working memory, executive functions, memory, visuospatial abilities and language. Score of patients with or without distressing fatigue (defined as a PFS score\u00a0\u2265\u00a08) were compared by Student's t-test or Pearson's chi-square test. Logistic regression analyses were performed to search for motor and non-motor features independently associated with presence of distressing fatigue.Twelve (15%) patients presented distressing fatigue. Logistic regression identified sleepiness (p\u00a0= 0.04), \u201cepisodic anxiety\u201d subscale of PAS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and \u201ccognitive apathy\u201d subscale of AES (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) as the main factors associated with distressing fatigue. No significant association was found between diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment and distressing fatigue (p\u00a0= 0.745).In a sample of consecutive de novo PD patients, distressing fatigue is associated with episodic anxiety, cognitive apathy and sleepiness, but not with cognitive impairment. Our findings suggest possible shared pathogenic mechanisms underlying these non-motor symptoms and foster development of early combined therapeutic approaches.",

All subjects were contacted after 12 months for reassessment.For both hemispheres, using FSL FIRST, the thalamus was automatically segmented followed by inter-subject vertex-wise analyses involving group comparisons and behavioural correlates.There was significant bilateral atrophy in the ventral-dorsal and pulvinar regions in DLB relative to controls (pcorrected\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The DLB group was then re-categorised based on 12-month mortality data: DLB-a (n\u00a0=\u00a026) and DLB-d (n\u00a0=\u00a09) (a\u00a0=\u00a0alive, d\u00a0=\u00a0death within 12 months of study assessment). Compared to controls, significant attentional dysfunction and bilateral atrophy of the pulvinar, ventral and dorsal nuclei were observed in DLB-d (pcorrected\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas in DLB-a, atrophy was far less extensive.Distinct patterns of thalamic atrophy occur in DLB that may relate to the attentional dysfunction and cognitive fluctuations that characterise this disorder. Relative to controls, the extent of attentional impairment and pattern of thalamic degeneration differ in those patients who died within 12 months of assessment, despite having an otherwise similar level of dementia severity. These findings may provide insight into the neurobiological changes underpinning important clinical characteristics and disease heterogeneity.",

We repeatedly measured ataxia progression by the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia every 6 months for 2 years. Regression models were employed to study the association between dystonia and ataxia progression after adjusting for age, sex and pathological CAG repeats. We used logistic regression to analyze the impact of different repeat expansion genes on dystonia in SCAs.Dystonia was most commonly observed in SCA3, followed by SCA2, SCA1, and SCA6. Dystonia was associated with longer CAG repeats in SCA3. The CAG repeat number in TBP normal alleles appeared to modify the presence of dystonia in SCA1. The presence of dystonia was associated with higher SARA scores in SCA1, 2, and 3. Although relatively rare in SCA6, the presence of dystonia was associated with slower progression of ataxia.The presence of dystonia is associated with greater severity of ataxia in SCA1, 2, and 3, but predictive of a slower progression in SCA6. Complex genetic interactions among repeat expansion genes can lead to diverse clinical symptoms and progression in SCAs.",

A correct diagnosis of DRD is crucial, given that this is an exquisitely treatable neurogenetic disorder. Although genetic testing is now widely available, we hypothesize that DRD is still underdiagnosed and its prevalence underestimated.Molecular genetic analysis of the GCH1 gene was performed in a representative cohort of 47 Serbian patients with clinical features of DRD and in their 16 available relatives. The DRD prevalence rate in Serbia was estimated based on population size, catchment area, and the centralized Serbian referral system for rare diseases.We identified 9 different GCH1 mutations in 23 individuals from 11 families, 5 of which are novel. Patients displayed a broad range of clinical phenotypes. The estimated prevalence of GCH1-related DOPA-responsive dystonia in Serbia was 2.96 per million individuals and there was no evidence for a common founder.Our data expand the genotypic spectrum of GCH1 and confirm the broad phenotypic spectrum of DRD in the Serbian population. The number of detected mutation carriers in this sample implies that the frequency of DRD in the Serbian population is considerably higher than expected based on published prevalence rates, suggesting that the prevalence of this treatable disease should be revisited also in other populations.",

Levodopa therapy causes increased plasma HC, but it remains unclear whether elevated plasma HC is associated with cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD).The study population includes all participants in the Pacific Northwest Udall Center (PANUC) Clinical cohort at the time of the study, consisting of 294 individuals with PD who had a standardized neuropsychological assessment and plasma collection for HC measurement. We tested the hypothesis that elevated plasma HC is inversely related to cognitive function in patients with PD.As expected, plasma HC was positively associated with age, disease duration, disease severity, and levodopa usage, while cognitive function was associated with age, education, gender, and APOE genotype, so subsequent analyses controlled for these covariates. When plasma HC was dichotomized as normal (<14\u00a0\u03bcmol/L) or elevated (\u226514\u00a0\u03bcmol/L), subjects with hyper-homocysteinemia had lower scores on Digit Symbol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031), Hopkins Verbal Learning Task (HVLT) Delayed Recall (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and semantic verbal fluency (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049).

No significant associations were found between apathy and other parameters such as age, sex distribution, disease duration, anxiety, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) score and remaining domain scores for NMSS.Apathy is not rare (22.56%) in Chinese treatment-na\u00efve PD patients. Apathy in PD is not only related to the severity of motor symptoms of the disease but also to some non-motor symptoms, such as executive dysfunction, depression and sleep disturbances.",

Endoscopic botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) injection has been used in the treatment of dysphagia, gastroparesis and chronic anismus.To examine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of endoscopically delivered BoNT injection to distal esophagus, pylorus or anal canal aiming at relieving regional gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with PD.This is a retrospective open cohort pilot study to assess the clinical response to endoscopic BoNT injection on selected PD patients with symptoms and identifiable abnormalities on high-resolution manometry and wireless motility capsule, to generate early uncontrolled data on feasibility, tolerability, safety and efficacy. Baseline symptoms and response to therapy were assessed by questionnaires.Fourteen PD patients (10\u00a0M:4\u00a0F), mean age 73 (range: 62-93) were treated. Three patients had esophageal Botox for ineffective esophageal motility (IEM) (n\u00a0=\u00a01), esophago-gastric junction outlet obstruction (EGJOO) & IEM (n\u00a0=\u00a01), and diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Nine patients were treated with pyloric BoNT injection for gastroparesis with mean gastric transit time of 21.2\u00a0h; range 5.2\u201344.2\u00a0h. Two patients received anal Botox for defecatory dyssynergia ((Type I) (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and overlap (slow-transit and dyssynergic) constipation (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Endoscopic BoNT injection (100-200 units) was well tolerated and there were no significant adverse events.Endoscopic BoNT injection to esophagus, pylorus or anal canal is safe, well-tolerated and leads to symptomatic improvement that lasts up to several months.

This process has been suggested to be supported by a distributed set of brain regions, collectively referred to as the Default Mode Network (DMN). Recently, reduced recruitment and connectivity of the DMN has been described in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients compared to healthy controls. We thus aimed to explore whether PD patients with normal cognitive test scores show differential MW capabilities compared to healthy controls.Thirty PD patients and thirty age-matched controls, all with a Montreal cognitive assessment (MoCA) score of 26 or above, performed a novel yet validated thought-sampling paradigm used to assess the frequency and extent of MW irrespective of cognitive load in which participants were asked to observe a series of geometric shapes and describe their thoughts after watching them. Shapes were presented one at a time for varying durations across nine trials.PD patients showed significantly less MW compared to the control. ANCOVA revealed a significant interaction indicating that the difference in MW scores was driven by trials with short stimulus presentation times.These findings provide evidence for decreased MW in PD patients. We propose that this is due to difficulties in performing MW within short time frames.",

It is characterized by a pathological forward bending of the trunk during standing, often combined with a lateral trunk deviation. The etiology of camptocormia in PD is still unknown. Muscle MRI studies show abnormalities mainly of the erector spinae confirmed by muscle biopsies. Quantitative electromyographic examination of trunk muscle activity is missing.Ventral (rectus and obliquus externus abdominis) and dorsal (iliocostalis lumborum, longissimus, multifidus) trunk muscles and the rectus femoris were recorded bilaterally with surface electromyography in standing PD patients with camptocormia (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and matched healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a010) who mimicked the patients' posture. EMG amplitudes were compared quantitatively. In controls, the relation between varying degrees of trunk flexion and EMG was established systematically.Increasing forward trunk flexion was associated with increasing back muscle activity in controls, while abdominal muscle activity was negligible. During anterolateral trunk flexion, back muscle activity increased particularly on the contralateral side. The patients showed a similar pattern. However, normalized EMG activity of their trunk extensors was significantly higher than in controls, often reaching half-maximal amplitudes. Their rectus femoris and oblique abdominal muscles were overactive, but to a lesser extent.PD patients with camptocormia must use the functional reserve of their lumbar trunk muscles to counteract gravity. We interpret this as a weakness of the paravertebral muscles. Compared to the other examined muscles the paravertebral muscles are most affected. The increased EMG activity of the rectus femoris warrants further research.",

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is an accurate indirect method for estimating brain iron levels in\u00a0vivo. This method has yet to be applied in atypical parkinsonism. We aimed to investigate differences in brain iron accumulation parkinsonian disorders and healthy controls using QSM.15 patients with PSP, 11 patients with MSA, 62 patients with PD and 14 healthy controls were included in the study and their phase and magnitude data from susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were retrospectively analyzed with an in-house pipeline to create susceptibility maps. Two-way ANCOVA were used to assess group differences. Pairwise comparisons within the ANCOVA were corrected for multiple comparisons.Red nucleus susceptibility was higher in PSP compared with PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), MSA (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), which separated PSP from these groups with areas under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.97, 0.75 and 0.98 respectively. PSP showed higher globus pallidus susceptibility compared with PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), MSA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Putamen susceptibility was higher in MSA than in PD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). Substantia nigra susceptibility was increased in PD compared to controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030).We show that all studied parkinsonian disorders have increased susceptibility subcortically, reflecting distinct topographical patterns of abnormal brain iron accumulation. QSM, particularly of the red nucleus, is a promising biomarker in differentiating parkinsonian disorders, and would be interesting to study longitudinally for monitoring disease progression and treatment effects.",

Chitotriosidase activity was similar across the genetic groups, while the levels of key lipids were altered in GBA mutation carriers: Monohexosylceramide, Ceramide and Sphingomyelin were elevated; while Phosphatidic acid (PA), Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), Plasmalogen phosphatidylethanolamine (PEp) and Acyl Phosphatidylglycerol (AcylPG) were decreased.The results suggest an important role for these lipids in GBA mediated Parkinson's disease and assist in the identification of common pathways between Gaucher and Parkinson's.

This study aimed to evaluate relationships between RWA, DEB and clinical characteristics of PD.We conducted overnight polysomnography in 145 patients with PD. DEB (motor behaviors and/or vocalizations during REM) and increased RWA (IRWA; tonic and phasic chin EMG density\u00a0\u2265\u00a030% and \u226515%, respectively) were identified. Patients were categorized as clinical RBD (DEB and IRWA), sub-DEB positive (DEB only), subclinical RBD (IRWA only), or normal REM sleep.Patients with DEB had higher Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) stage, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III score, levodopa equivalent dose(LEDs), and worse cognition. RWA was associated with H&Y stage, LEDs, cognition, and sleep structure in all patients. PD duration was associated with RWA, but not DEB. The PD patients who exhibited clinical or subclinical RBD, compared to sub-DEB positive, had higher H&Y stage, UPDRS III score and LEDs, lower cognitive score, worse sleep structure than the PD\u00a0+\u00a0cREM group.Both DEB and RWA were associated with severity of PD illness. Subclinical RBD might have different disease progression from sub-DEB positive. DEB symptoms may fluctuate or disappear whereas RWA may continue to develop as PD progresses. Differences in the course of DEB and RWA may reflect the difference in the degeneration process of neurodegenerative disorders.",

LB counts were measured in middle frontal (MF), superior temporal (ST), inferior parietal (IP), cingulate (CG), and parahippocampal (PH) gyri.None of the variants examined were significantly associated with LB counts in any brain region or with LBD subtype after correcting for multiple testing. Nominally significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) associations with LB counts where the direction of association was in agreement with that observed in the PD GWAS meta-analysis were observed for variants in BCKDK/STX1B (MF, ST, IP) and SNCA (ST). Additionally, MIR4697 and BCKDK/STX1B variants were nominally associated with LBD subtype.The lack of a significant association between PD GWAS variants and severity of LB pathology is consistent with the generally subtle association odds ratios that have been observed in disease-risk analysis. These results also suggest that genetic factors other than the susceptibility loci may determine quantitative neuropathologic outcomes in patients with LBD.",

     "abstract": "Pain is an important nonmotor symptom in movement disorders. Dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by involuntary, sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal movements, postures or both. Contrary to common views the nonmotor symptoms are present in dystonia patients. Pain is a prevailing feature of cervical dystonia (CD), the most common form of focal dystonia. The mechanism of pain in CD remains mostly unknown, but there are growing evidence that it could not be only the consequence of muscle hyperactivity. We have shown that botulinum toxin (BoNT) produced pain relief before muscle relaxation and that effect on pain relief lasted longer than the effect on motor improvement. More and more data suggest that pain relief could be attributed to the direct effect of BoNT type A on central nervous system. Pain, depression, and anxiety have been shown to be significant determinants of QoL in focal dystonia patients. Routine clinical examination in patients with dystonia should include evaluation of motor as well as non-motor symptoms. Selective rating assessment should be used in clinical practice to quantify pain. Specific assessment of pain is important to determine the effect of BoNT as the most effective treatment in focal dystonia.",

Its clinical presentation makes complex the care of patients with HD, further impacted by the progressive loss of dependence and disability. Intuitively, HD management calls for multispecialty care.Literature review and expert-based statement.Chorea is the only indication for symptomatic treatments in HD. Surgical therapies are experimental, and exercise-based physical interventions have been assessed but in small feasibility studies. In HD, multispecialty care requires the active involvement of physicians, therapists, social workers and nutritionists. In about half of the HD clinics, a multidisciplinary case review is offered. It is still unknown what is the care delivery model that is best for HD. Palliative care is an important concept in HD care focusing in quality of life, considering physical, psychosocial, and spiritual problems. Palliative care may delay nursing home placement in advanced HD.There is a support for multispecialty care in HD, but more evidence needs to be generated through clinical research. The implementation of technology in the multispecialty care of patients with HD has a significant potential for reducing the care burden for families and the healthcare team, and to secure a wider care delivery.",

All the participants underwent a clinical, emotional and psychiatric evaluation.IS was lower in CD patients than in HC. The ROC curve analysis showed that an IS value of 0.52 differentiates CD patients from healthy controls. No correlations emerged in CD patients between IS and the demographic, clinical and emotional features. No differences were observed in either CD patients or healthy subjects when IS was retested 4\u20136 months after the first evaluation.

     "abstract": "The genetic architecture of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is increasingly taking shape. Initially, genetic research focused mainly on linkage and candidate gene studies in small series of DLB patients. More recently, association and exome sequencing studies in larger groups have been conducted, and have shown that several variants in GBA and the APOE \u03b54 allele are important genetic risk factors for DLB. However, genetic research in DLB is still in its infancy. So far, many genetic studies have been biased and performed in clinically and pathologically heterogeneous populations. Therefore, it is likely that multiple DLB-specific genetic determinants still have to be identified. To further our understanding of the role of genetics in DLB, future genetic studies should be unbiased and performed in large series of DLB patients, ideally with both a clinical diagnosis and pathological confirmation. The combination of genomic techniques with other research modalities, such as proteomic research, is a promising approach to identify novel genetic determinants. More knowledge about the genetics of DLB will increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and its relation with Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease, and may eventually lead to the development of disease modifying treatments.",

However, non-motor symptoms such as cognitive, autonomic, sleep-related and sensory dysfunctions are often reported. A subgroup of non-motor symptoms, oropharyngeal problems, also affects these patients in ways that greatly deteriorate quality of life. Each patient may develop a different set of non-motor symptoms, making interprofessional collaboration among health care providers a must to treat patients with PD. In this review, we argue that dental health professionals must be included in this interprofessional health care team. Patients with PD are at a higher risk for developing oral health problems that can exacerbate or be exacerbated by other non-motor symptoms, such as mental health and dysphagia This accelerates decline in quality of life and even increases the risk of death by aspiration pneumonia. Dentists can create preventive oral health plans as soon as a diagnosis is made and promptly treat a patient's dental problems, preventing them from affecting other health areas. We describe major oral health concerns and how health professionals and dentists can participate and collaborate to improve the health of patients with PD.",

Whether plasma levels are similarly depressed in drug na\u00efve subjects, or affected by dopaminergic drugs, is unknown. Our objectives were to determine whether (i) peptide products in plasma differ from normal in PD, and (ii) levels are affected by dopaminergic treatment.Plasma C-type Natriuretic Peptide and amino-terminal proCNP were measured in two groups \u2013 27 drug na\u00efve subjects with PD, and 30 subjects stabilized on dopaminergic drugs for at least 3 years. Values were compared with standard deviation scores from a population reference group without neurological disorder. Independent associations with predetermined variables known to affect plasma concentrations were assessed by multivariate analysis.In both PD groups, plasma amino-terminal proCNP was significantly depressed compared to the reference range. Concentrations did not differ between the two groups. No correlation with disease duration or phenotype was found. Across all subjects, in a model initially comprising 7 factors, serum creatinine, PD and age were independent significant associations with amino-terminal proCNP.Plasma concentrations of amino-terminal proCNP are depressed in PD, are likely to result from diminished reabsorption from central sources, and may be useful in monitoring onset and effects of therapeutic interventions in PD.",

Assessments were performed annually after baseline. The primary outcome measure was anxiety, as measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).

An increase in STAI total score was predicted by older age, lower score on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and the presence of a probable REM-sleep behavior disorder (RBD) at baseline. A decrease in STAI total score over time was predicted by a higher baseline score on the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, compulsive behavior at baseline and a family history of PD.More severe baseline anxiety was associated with compulsive behavior and depressive symptoms. These symptoms had a parallel course, showing a decrease over time. An increase in anxiety was predicted by older age, worse cognitive functioning and the presence of RBD.

     "abstract": "Considering that psychosis in Parkinson disease (PD) is associated with worse outcomes, including dementia, we aimed to study the characteristics, correlates, and assessment of PD psychosis in those without dementia.101 PD subjects without dementia (Montreal Cognitive Assessment \u226521/30) were recruited to participate in a study of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD. This study included a baseline standard neurological exam and common PD symptom assessments. Using the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS) and separate assessment of visual illusions and sense of presence, NINDS-NIMH criteria for PD psychosis were applied.Of the 33 (32.7%) PD subjects who met diagnostic criteria for psychosis in PD, visual illusions were most common (72.7%), followed by visual hallucinations (39.4%). Adjusted for presence of REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.097), use of dopamine agonists (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) and greater autonomic symptom burden (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.1 (per 1-unit change in score on SCOPA-AUT), p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) were associated with greater risk of psychosis. Use of dopamine agonists (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), higher MDS-UPDRS Part II score (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.010), and presence of RBD (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) were independent predictors of visual hallucinations and visual illusions. MDS-UPDRS item 1.2 score \u22651 had highly correlated with the SAPS score (r\u00a0=\u00a00.65, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but was 42% sensitive and 96% specific for identifying psychosis.This study confirms the association between dopamine agonists and psychosis in PD patients without dementia. The association of RBD, autonomic symptoms, and MDS-UPDRS Part II scores with psychosis underscore its link to brainstem dysfunction and greater PD motor symptom severity.",

     "abstract": "Objective, portable measures of motor function for out-of-office assessments are needed in Parkinson's Disease (PD). This study had 3 objectives. First, to examine change in objective motor measurements in PD (as assessed with the Objective PD Measurement (OPDM) system). Second, to correlate objective measures with clinical features and putative PD cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and dopaminergic imaging biomarkers. Third, to assess participant compliance with and perceptions of serial in-home motor assessments.De novo PD subjects participating in this pilot study of the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) completed OPDM assessments at home weekly for 3 months and in the clinic at baseline and 3-, 6-, and 12-months. Tasks included (i)digitography (ii)a repetitive hand tapping task and (iii)timed pegboard task. A global objective motor score (OMS) was derived from the latter three. MDS-UPDRS-III score was obtained at each time point, and CSF and dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT at baseline.27 participants, mean age 62.6 years, 19 male were included. A mean of 10.5 in-home assessments were completed. There was no significant change in in-home OMS over 12 weeks (p\u00a0=\u00a00.48). There was strong correlation between mean baseline OMS and MDS-UPDRS-III scores (spearman's rho\u00a0=\u00a00.60, p=<0.0001). Baseline OMS predicted 6-month MDS-UPDRS-III (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.80, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) but not change in MDS-UPDRS-III score, DAT SPECT, or putative CSF biomarkers.This study suggests that administration of in-home motor tasks as part of a large multi-center study is feasible and scores derived from these assessments may serve as surrogates of in-person clinician-assessed motor score.",

     "abstract": "Distinct motor subtypes of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been described through both clinical observation and through data-driven approaches. However, the extent to which motor subtypes change during disease progression remains unknown. Our objective was to determine motor subtypes of PD using an unsupervised clustering methodology and evaluate subtype changes with disease duration.The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database of 423 newly diagnosed PD patients was utilized to retrospectively identify unique motor subtypes through a data-driven, hierarchical correlational clustering approach. For each patient, we assigned a subtype to each motor assessment at each follow-up visit (time points) and by using published criteria. We examined changes in PD subtype with disease duration using both qualitative and quantitative methods.Five distinct motor subtypes were identified based on the motor assessment items and these included: Tremor Dominant (TD), Axial Dominant, Appendicular Dominant, Rigidity Dominant, and Postural and Instability Gait Disorder Dominant. About half of the patients had consistent subtypes at all time points. Most patients met criteria for TD subtype soon after diagnosis. For patients with inconsistent subtypes, there was an overall trend to shift away from a TD phenotype with disease duration, as shown by chi-squared test, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, and linear regression analysis, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.These results strongly suggest that classification of motor subtypes in PD can shift with increasing disease duration. Shifting subtypes is a factor that should be accounted for in clinical practice or in clinical trials.",

We assessed a prospective sample of 75 non-demented PD patients (normal cognition, n\u00a0=\u00a050; PD-MCI, n\u00a0=\u00a025) using both tools, administered on two consecutive days, in a randomized order.The PD-CRS/AF showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.80). Differences between total mean scores were not significant. Floor/ceiling effects were acceptable. The discriminative power for MCI was high for both tools (area under the curve 0.91; 95% CI, 0.84\u20130.98 for PD-CRS; 0.88, 95% CI, 0.80\u20130.96 for PD-CRS/AF).

All patients underwent dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) with 123I-ioflupane, and a short-echo single-voxel 1H-MRS on a 3T scanner. A voxel of 10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u00a0mm involving the Vim nucleus was acquired in both thalami of all subjects. Peak areas of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), creatine (Cr), glycerophosphocholine (Cho), and glutamate (Glu) were measured for each voxel using LCModel. The NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and Glu/Cr ratios were then calculated.DAT-SPECT was abnormal in tPD patients, whereas it was normal in rET patients. Patients with tPD showed a significant reduction of NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr in the thalami compared to rET and healthy controls; whereas there were no significant differences between rET patients and controls. The combination of thalamic NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios showed a 100% accuracy in distinguishing tPD patients from rET patients and controls.This study provides preliminary evidence that thalamic neurometabolic abnormalities occur in tremor-dominant phenotype of PD, and suggests that 1H-MRS can help differentiate patients with tPD from those with rET.",

Clinical, cognitive and psychopathological evaluations were performed. Diffusion tensor MRI metrics of the main white matter tracts were assessed using a tractography approach.Compared with controls, both PD groups showed white matter microstructural alterations of the left pedunculopontine tract and splenium of the corpus callosum. PD-punding patients showed a further damage to the right pedunculopontine tract and uncinate fasciculus, genu of the corpus callosum, and left parahippocampal tract relative to controls. When adjusting for depression and/or apathy severity, a greater damage of the genu of the corpus callosum and the left pedunculopontine tract was found in PD-punding compared with patients with no impulsive-compulsive behaviours.PD-punding is associated with a disconnection between midbrain, limbic and white matter tracts projecting to the frontal cortices. These alterations are at least partially independent of their psychopathological changes. Diffusion tensor MRI is a powerful tool for understanding the neural substrates underlying punding in PD.",

Adherence was measured as a ratio between dispensed and prescribed durations and was modeled as: non-adherence (<20%, n\u00a0=\u00a01566), poor (20%\u201350%, n\u00a0=\u00a01184), moderate (50%\u201380%, n\u00a0=\u00a01584), and good (>80%, n\u00a0=\u00a04219) adherence. Multivariable survival analyses adjusted for demographic and clinical variables including physical comorbidities known to influence mortality were conducted, however there was no adjustment for other psychiatric disorders and medications.Unadjusted mortality rates were 20.4%, 25.1%, 23.4% and 25.6% in those classified as non-adherent, poor, moderate and good adherence respectively (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a018.45, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

We aimed at evaluating SN 7T magnetic resonance imaging (7T-MRI) in patients with RBD and determining the agreement between MRI and 123I-FP-CIT SPECT.Fifteen patients with idiopathic RBD confirmed by polysomnography and a recent 123I-FP-CIT SPECT underwent a 7T MR by using three-dimensional gradient-recalled-echo multiecho susceptibility-weighted imaging of the SN; the findings were randomly presented with those of 14 HS and 28 patients with PD and blindly evaluated by an expert neuroradiologist, according to recently published criteria. MRI and SPECT results were also compared.Nine subjects with RBD had abnormal SPECT; among them, the findings of 7T-MRI were rated abnormal in eight. Out of six subjects with RBD with normal SPECT, the 7T-MRI findings of five were rated normal. The Cohen's kappa statistic value of agreement was 0.722.Gradient-recalled-echo multiecho susceptibility-weighted imaging of the SN at 7T is abnormal in 60% of patients with RBD.

Data regarding clinical status, indications and outcomes were retrieved from medical files. The main outcome measure was survival duration following gastrostomy insertion according to Kaplan-Meier estimate. Cox analysis was also performed to identify factors associated with survival. Finally, we described short term and long term adverse effects occurring during the follow-up period.We identified 33 patients with Parkinsonism that received GTI during the study period. One patient was excluded from the analysis because of missing data. Among 32 patients, 7 (22%) had Parkinson's disease and 25 (78%) had atypical parkinsonism. The median survival following the procedure was 186 days (CI 95% [62\u2013309]). In Cox model analysis, total dependency was the only factor negatively associated with survival (HR 0.1; 95% CI [0.02\u20130.4], p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Pneumonia was the most frequent adverse event.In this sample of patients with parkinsonian syndromes, survival after GTI was short particularly in totally dependent subjects.

The present study explored the impact of specific non-motor symptoms on the HRQoL in PD.Eighty-four outpatients underwent the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) assessing global functioning and several questionnaires to assess depression, apathy, impulse control disorders (ICD), anxiety, anhedonia and functional impact of cognitive impairment. The perceived QoL was assessed by Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-8).The PD sample was divided into patients with high and low HRQoL around the median of PDQ-8 and compared on clinical features, cognitive and neuropsychiatric variables. A linear regression analysis, in which the global functioning, apathy, depression, anxiety, anhedonia, ICD and the functional autonomy scores were entered as independent variables and PDQ-8 score as dependent variable, was applied.Patients with lower HRQoL were more depressed, apathetic, anxious and showed more severe reduction of functional autonomy and global functioning than patients with high HRQoL. The regression analysis revealed that higher level of anxiety, executive apathy and more reduced functional autonomy were significantly associated with higher score on PDQ-8.The finding indicated that anxiety, apathy associated with impaired planning, attention and organization (i.e., executive apathy evaluated by the Dimensional Apathy Scale) and reduced functional autonomy contribute significantly to reduce the HRQoL in PD. Therefore, early identification and management of these neuropsychiatric symptoms should be relevant to preserve HRQoL in PD.",

Earlier studies focused on the startle, blink and trigemino-cervical reflexes and showed several brainstem abnormalities. Studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation have revealed a number of abnormalities in primary motor cortex and inter-hemispheric connectivity. More recent studies have highlighted the role of cerebellar dysfunction and have reported altered movement kinematics. Neurophysiological abnormalities in APs reflect degeneration or functional changes at multiple brain levels. In the majority of cases, APs share common abnormalities even though some neurophysiological changes differ among the various APs. Evidence of a correlation between neurophysiological abnormalities and clinical signs and symptoms in APs is limited. This paper provides an update on the results of experimental investigations using neurophysiological techniques in APs and also reviews similarities and differences between APs and Parkinson's disease.

Different tools have been used to assess this coordination, however the results have been inconsistent. We aimed to investigate this coordination in patients with Parkinson's disease using a non-invasive method.Signals of submental muscle activity, thyroid cartilage excursion, and nasal airflow during swallowing were recorded simultaneously. Five different water boluses were swallowed three times, and the data were recorded and analyzed.Thirty-seven controls and 42 patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease were included. The rates of non-expiratory/expiratory pre- and post-swallowing respiratory phase patterns were higher in the patients than in the controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The rates of piecemeal deglutition when swallowing 10-ml and 20-ml water boluses and overall were also significantly higher in the patients (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). There were differences in oropharyngeal swallowing parameters between the patients and controls, including a pharyngeal phase delay with longer total excursion duration and excursion time in the patients swallowing small water boluses (1\u00a0ml, 3\u00a0ml and 5\u00a0ml), but no difference in the length of swallowing respiratory pause.Oropharyngeal swallowing and its coordination with respiration are affected in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease, and safety compensation mechanisms were used more than efficiency during swallowing. The results of this study may serve as a baseline for further research into new treatment regimens and to improve the management of swallowing in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

     "abstract": "Clinical staging of Parkinson's disease (PD) is important for patient management and prognosis. The non-motor and functional features visual hallucinations, recurrent falls, dementia and nursing home placement are currently not included in clinical staging schemes, but have been suggested as clinical milestones with important prognostic implications in advanced PD. In this study, we sought to evaluate the potential of these four milestone events for clinical staging and prognosis during the early years of the disease.We recruited 185 patients with incident PD and monitored prospectively every six months through seven years for emergence and consequences of four clinical milestones.One or more milestones were reached in 53.0%. Of the patients who reached the milestones, visual hallucinations appeared after a median of 3.3 (interquartile range 1.3\u20134.9) years from diagnosis, recurrent falls after 3.8 (2.8\u20135.2) years, dementia after 4.0 (2.1\u20134.8) years and nursing home placement after 5.4 (3.9\u20136.7) years. Presence of any milestone was associated with occurrence of other milestones (relative risks 1.9\u20136.3; all p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). Experiencing two or more milestones increased the risk of death during the study (relative risk 2.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).In early PD, visual hallucinations, recurrent falls, dementia and nursing home placement appear closely interrelated, possibly reflecting a shared neuropathological disease stage. All events convey important and sinister information on PD status and prognosis and are relatively easily accessible during routine clinical consultations. Therefore, they appear highly useful as clinical PD milestones and could possibly be incorporated into a novel disease rating scale.",

     "abstract": "To provide a quantitative estimation of motor fluctuations in PD through a 12-h Waking-day Motor Assessment (WDMA) and to develop new WDMA-based tools, the Motor Fluctuation Indices.Two independent samples of PD patients (exploratory population N\u00a0=\u00a051, testing population N\u00a0=\u00a0109) were examined. Patients underwent a WDMA using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and were classified as either having or not having motor fluctuations. To quantify motor fluctuations, the Worsening Index (WI), the Mean Fluctuation Index (MFI) and the Coefficient of Variation (CV) were computed. The optimal cut-off for each index distinguishing patients with or without fluctuations was calculated on the exploratory population. Cut-offs\u2019 accuracy was then verified in the testing population.Optimal cut-off scores to differentiate stable patients from fluctuating ones were 8.3 for WI, 5 for MFI and 12.9 for CV. Sensitivity and a specificity were 91.2% (95%CI: 85.9 to 96.5) and 87.8% (95%CI: 81.7 to 93.9) for WI; 75% (95%CI: 66.9 to 83.1) and 90.2% (95%CI: 84.7 to 95.8) for MFI; 69.1% (95%CI: 60.4 to 77.8) and 95.1% (95%CI: 91.1 to 99.2) for CV. Patients with a larger magnitude of fluctuation had higher values for all three indices, whereas patients with multiple daily fluctuations presented only higher WI values.WDMA-derived Motor Fluctuation Indices may represent reliable tools for evaluating and quantifying the severity of motor fluctuations in PD patients. Even if WDMA is a time-consuming procedure, the detection of Motor Fluctuation Indices could be helpful in assessing therapeutic efficacy on motor fluctuations.",

Then, we compared patients by disease duration and the presence of swallowing disturbances.Overall, adherence of PD patients (males, 53.8%; mean disease duration, 9.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.0 years) to MeDi was similar to controls (score, 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7 vs. 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6; P\u00a0=\u00a00.294). Patients consumed less alcohol and fish and drank significantly less water, coffee, and milk which resulted also in lower total fluids intake. On the contrary, they ate more fruit, cooked vegetables, cereals and baked items, more dressings and more sweets in general. Disease duration was associated with increased intake of several food groups but it was not associated with changes in MeDi score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.721). Patients with swallowing disturbances (n\u00a0=\u00a072) preferred softer and more viscous food but preferences did not result in differences in dietary pattern. However, patients with dysphagia drank less fluids (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043).PD patients presented different dietary habits and food preferences compared to the general population and adherence to MeDi was not associated with disease duration. Self-reported dysphagia was associated with reduced intake of fluids. These aspects may be amenable to change in order to improve the management of nutritional issues in this patient population.",

We studied 590 consecutive patients from the NCC Registry at Eugenio Espejo Hospital, Quito, Ecuador, and found 23 subjects who developed movement disorders. We investigated the clinical features, localization of brain lesions, severity of infection and neurological deficit as well as the outcome of the patients. Patients were treated with albendazole, dexamethasone, acetazolamide and surgery. We established the diagnosis of NCC, by absolute, imaging and clinical/exposure criteria.Fifteen patients had parkinsonism, 5 tremor, 2 dystonia and 1 chorea. Patients with chorea and dystonia were young females and had cystic lesions in the thalamus and putamen, respectively. Parkinsonism was more frequent in middle aged subjects with subarachnoid and ventricular cysts, hydrocephalus, brain cysts and frequently abnormal cerebrospinal fluid. After anthelmintic treatment no patient died and all patients with chorea, dystonia and tremor fully recovered; 7 of the 15 patients with parkinsonism required treatment with steroids, surgery and long term l-DOPA therapy.Chorea and dystonia in NCC are due to selective lesions of the basal ganglia. Parkinsonism, the most common movement disorder in NCC, is not related to specific localization of the lesions but the patients show widespread and large lesions, associated with inflammation and distortions of brain structures. In patients with NCC, chorea, dystonia, tremor have a better prognosis, Parkinsonism has a worse one.",

CAG repeats at ATXN1, ATXN2, ATXN3, CACNA1A, ATXN7 and RAI1, and polymorphism A10398G at mtDNA were established. Group characteristics were compared, with a p\u00a0<\u00a00.05.Forty-eight SCA2 individuals were included. Age at onset, CAGexp, and disease duration explained 53% and 43% of SARA and NESSCA variations, respectively. CAGexp of subjects with and without parkinsonism were different (medians of 42 and 39 repeats) as well as of subjects with and without dystonia (44 and 40 repeats). Amyotrophy was not significantly related to any variable under study. Concerning polymorphism A10398G, 83% of subjects with and 34% of those without cognitive decline carried 10398G at (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).Treating the four phenotypic subgroups as outcomes was a valid strategy to identify modifiers of disease. Among correlations found, some confirmed previous reports, such as that between dystonia and CAGexp. Of note was the association between cognitive decline and the variant G at mitochondrial polymorphism A10398G, a variant formerly related to earlier ages at onset in SCA2.",

Previous studies have suggested that chronic gastrointestinal tract is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease.This study investigated the potential link between colonic diverticular disease and risk of Parkinson's disease.Data in this nationwide population-based cohort study were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database. Patients with colonic diverticular disease were identified from among 23.22 million insured Taiwanese residents who had been diagnosed between 2000 and 2005 and were aged \u226520 years (n\u00a0=\u00a023367). The comparison cohort included patients without colonic diverticular disease, matched by sex, age, and all comorbidities with the colonic diverticular disease patients cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a023367). Using univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models, we estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for PD with a 95% confidence interval (CI) after adjusting for age, sex, and all of comorbidities.The risk of Parkinson's disease was higher in the CDD cohort than in the comparison cohort (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.27, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.10\u20131.47).

A multivariate Cox regression model was used to investigate survival with the independent predictors of age, gender, severity of motor impairment, levodopa-equivalent daily dose of medication, presence of cognitive defects, and putaminal specific binding ratio (SBR) of [I-123]FP-CIT. In addition, associations between striatal and extrastriatal SBRs and survival were investigated using voxel-based analyses.The overall mortality was 25.9%, and the Kaplan-Meier estimate for mortality was 36%. Older age (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), presence of cognitive defects (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and more severe motor symptom severity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) were significantly associated with increased mortality. No associations were found between putaminal DAT binding and survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.99). There were no significant differences in SBRs in any striatal or extrastriatal region between survivors and non-survivors, and no associations were found between SBRs and scan-to-death intervals among non-survivors.Unlike the severity of motor and cognitive symptoms, the level of striatal dopaminergic defect in DAT SPECT does not predict mortality in PD. Although presynaptic dopaminergic functional imaging may have value as a diagnostic tool, the clinical symptom-based characteristics are superior for predicting lifespan.",

Diagnoses for a large subset of individuals were independently determined through national mortality and hospital admissions datasets. We used a Bayesian model, accommodating diagnostic uncertainty and bias, to estimate the number of people with Parkinson\u2019s.The 2013 prevalence of Parkinson\u2019s in New Zealand was 210 per 100\u00a0000 population (95% uncertainty interval 208\u2013212) with age-standardized prevalence rates higher for males (ratio 1.6:1). Incidence was 31 per 100\u00a0000 person-years (95% uncertainty interval 30\u201332), also higher in males (ratio 1.8:1). Incidence and prevalence by age increased exponentially until 75 years, peaked at 85 years, and then dropped sharply.The prevalence of Parkinson\u2019s in New Zealand is expected to double over a 25-year period but then increase at a slower rate due to the drop-off in prevalence and incidence in the oldest old.

Perry syndrome patients frequently have sleep disturbances, including SAS and insomnia.We evaluated orexin immunoreactivity in Perry syndrome. Using imaging analysis, we quantitatively assessed orexin immunoreactivity in the nucleus basalis of Meynert in three Perry syndrome cases, as well as five cases of frontotemporal lobar degeneration with motor neuron disease, five cases of MSA and five age-matched controls. For these cases, antemortem clinical information on sleep disturbances has been reviewed.In Perry syndrome and MSA, there was reduction of orexin immunoreactivity compared with controls (Perry syndrome: p\u00a0=\u00a00.020, MSA: p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In contrast, FTLD-MND did not have significant reduction of orexin immunoreactivity. Two out of three cases of Perry syndrome had SAS confirmed by polysomnography.This is the first report assessing orexin immunoreactivity in Perry syndrome, and it showed significant reduction, similar to select neurodegenerative diseases, such as MSA. Further analysis with more cases will be needed to elucidate the specific mechanism of orexin loss in these disorders.",

A structured questionnaire was developed to assess subjective SB. Quantitative motor assessment was performed using a validated smartphone application. Objective motor SB was considered to be present when the waking motor function was similar or superior to the daytime on-state.Twenty (22%) patients showed objective motor improvement on waking compared to end-of-dose. Most patients (77%) reported subjective SB without corresponding objective motor benefit. Our structured questionnaire could not predict Motor SB. The ability to delay morning medications and a perception of indifference or paradoxical worsening following the morning levodopa dose may suggest Motor SB.Most patients experience subjective SB with no measureable motor improvement.

     "abstract": "Perry syndrome (PS) is a rare hereditary neurodegenerative disease characterized by autosomal dominant parkinsonism, psychiatric symptoms, weight loss, central hypoventilation, and distinct TDP-43 pathology. The mutated causative gene for PS is DCTN1, which encodes the dynactin subunit p150Glued. Dynactin is a motor protein involved in axonal transport; the p150Glued subunit has a critical role in the overall function. Since the discovery of DCTN1 in PS, it has been increasingly recognized that DCTN1 mutations can exhibit more diverse phenotypes than previously thought. Progressive supranuclear palsy- and/or frontotemporal dementia-like phenotypes have been associated with the PS phenotypes. In addition, DCTN1 mutations were identified in a family with motor-neuron disease before the discovery in PS. In this review, we analyze the clinical and genetic aspects of DCTN1-related neurodegeneration and discuss its pathogenesis. We also describe three families with PS, Canadian, Polish, and Brazilian. DCTN1 mutation was newly identified in two of them, the Canadian and Polish families. The Canadian family was first described in late 1970\u2019s but was never genetically tested. We recently had the opportunity to evaluate this family and to test the gene status of an affected family member. The Polish family is newly identified and is the first PS family in Poland. Although still rare, DCTN1-related neurodegeneration needs to be considered in a differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders, frontotemporal dementia, and motor-neuron diseases, especially if there is family history.",

Interventional MRI-guided (iMRI) DBS surgery was developed to use real-time image guidance, obviating the need for patients to be awake during lead placement.All English-speaking adults with PD who underwent iMRI DBS between 2010 and 2014\u00a0at our Center were invited to participate. Subjects completed a structured interview that explored perioperative preferences and experiences. We compared these responses to patients who underwent the physiology-guided method, matched for age and gender.Eighty-nine people with PD completed the study. Of those, 40 underwent iMRI, 44 underwent physiology-guided implantation, and five underwent both methods. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between groups. The primary reason for choosing iMRI DBS was a preference to be asleep during implantation due to: 1) a history of claustrophobia; 2) concerns about the potential for discomfort during the awake physiology-guided procedure in those with an underlying pain syndrome or severe off-medication symptoms; or 3) non-specific fear about being awake during neurosurgery.Participants were satisfied with both DBS surgery methods. However, identification of the factors associated with a preference for iMRI DBS may allow for optimization of patient experience and satisfaction when choices of surgical methods for DBS implantation are available.",

The current study aimed to compare the performance of these indexes in a well-characterized sample of PSP patients using either a manual or a fully automated approach to measure the brainstem structures involved in M/P and MRPI calculation.This study involved 179 patients affected by idiopathic PD, 35 patients affected by PSP (15 probable and 20 possible) and 87 healthy controls. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and area under the curve (AUC) of MRPI and M/P in distinguishing possible and probable PSP from PD and controls were calculated.No significant difference was found between manual and automated values for both MRPI and M/P. MRPI and M/P differentiated probable PSP from PD with similar performance. By contrast, MRPI showed higher sensitivity and specificity than M/P when patients with possible PSP were compared with PD (MRPI, sensitivity 100%, specificity 98.88%; M/P, sensitivity 85%, specificity 93.85%). A significant difference was also observed in AUC between MRPI and M/P in distinguishing possible PSP from PD.Our study demonstrates that MRPI was more accurate than M/P, in differentiating patients with possible PSP from those with PD. In patients suspected of having PSP with a low level of clinic diagnostic accuracy, MRPI should be preferred to M/P for distinguishing these patients from PD.",

The phenotypic spectrum associated with mutations in this gene is expanding. However, the ADCY5 mutational frequency in cohorts of paediatric patients with hyperkinetic movement disorders has not been evaluated.We performed a screening of the entire ADCY5 coding sequence in 44 unrelated subjects with genetically undiagnosed childhood-onset hyperkinetic movement disorders, featuring chorea alone or in combination with myoclonus and dystonia. All patients had normal CSF analysis and brain imaging and were regularly followed-up in tertiary centers for paediatric movement disorders.We identified five unrelated subjects with ADCY5 mutations (11% of the cohort). Three carried the p. R418W mutation, one the p. R418Q and one the p. R418G mutation. Mutations arose de novo in four cases, while one patient inherited the mutation from his similarly affected father. All patients had delayed motor and/or language milestones with or without axial hypotonia and showed generalized chorea and dystonia, with prominent myoclonic jerks in one case. Episodic exacerbations of the baseline movement disorder were observed in most cases, being the first disease manifestation in two patients. The disease course was variable, from stability to spontaneous improvement during adolescence.Mutations in ADCY5 are responsible for a hyperkinetic movement disorder that can be preceded by episodic attacks before the movement disorder becomes persistent and is frequently misdiagnosed as dyskinetic cerebral palsy. A residual degree of neck hypotonia and a myopathy-like facial appearance are frequently observed in patients with ADCY5 mutations.",

The survey involved the administration of questionnaires on beliefs, knowledge and attitudes about PD to the public, people with PD (PwPD) and traditional healers (THs).18% of the participants could identify PD through its symptoms. Mental illness, other diseases, stress, expressing strong emotions, consumption of certain foods or drinks and witchcraft were identified as possible causes of PD. PwPD and THs had a greater knowledge of PD than the public and greater age was a significant predictor of greater knowledge. The public and THs had a greater degree of concern about a range of symptoms of PD compared to PwPD.There is a striking lack of knowledge about PD amongst black South Africans. Almost half the members of the general public interviewed felt that PwPD should not live amongst their community, and a third considered that witchcraft could be a cause of PD. Finding ways to effectively educate members of a community about PD would make it easier for PwPD to adapt to their condition within their communities.",

A variability of tremor frequency between postural and kinetic tasks has been proposed in ET, suggesting either multiple central oscillating networks, or peripheral or proprioceptive feedback-mechanisms. This electrophysiological study aimed to assess tremor frequencies and amplitudes in tasks involving postural and kinetic tremor, and compare findings within and across tasks, to delineate physiological differences underlying individually affected manual tasks in ET.40\u00a0ET patients were included in the study. Tremor was characterized clinically, as well as electrophysiologically using accelerometry and digitizing tablet tasks. Tremor amplitude measures and frequencies were extracted for tasks involving kinetic (digital spiral drawing, handwriting), as well as postural tremor. Tremor was compared between and within tasks.Digital spiral tremor frequencies were significantly higher compared to postural tremor frequencies, as measured by accelerometry, with a mean difference of >2\u00a0Hz (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Within-task variability of repeated digital spirals revealed a significant amplitude reduction over time in both hands (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with an up to 32% reduction compared to the first spiral.ET exhibited a frequency variability, which was dependent on activation condition, suggesting neurophysiologically distinct pathways between postural and kinetic tremor. The reduction of tremor amplitudes observed in repeated digital spiral drawing may be explained by a learning effect or adaptation, and should be considered as non-random factor of variability when using spirals in ET to assess effects of interventions.",

These factors were reflective of executive dysfunction, memory, and verbal attention.

In addition, we review the effects of PD-related pharmacological and surgical treatments on visual function, and we offer practical recommendations for clinical management. Greater awareness and early recognition of ocular and visual problems in PD might enable timely instalment of tailored treatments, leading to improved patient safety, greater independence, and better quality of life.",

     "abstract": "Pregnancy does not often occur in the setting of Parkinson's disease (PD) as the most common age of onset is beyond the childbearing years, yet management of these two conditions is crucial for the health of both mother and child. Here we review treatment data of PD during pregnancy, primarily from case reports and drug registries, and focus on available evidence regarding the pregnancy risks for patient and fetus. Historically, it was reported that many women had worsening of symptoms during pregnancy but this may be because anti-parkinsonian medications were not recommended or were under dosed. Levodopa has the best safety data for use in pregnancy and amantadine should be avoided in women who are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. The data for other pharmacological and surgical treatments is less clear. There is no evidence that women with PD have higher rates of birth or fetal complications.",

We investigated the safety and efficacy of unilateral and bilateral constant-current DBS of the ventralis intermedius (VIM) nucleus of the thalamus in patients with essential tremor whose tremor was inadequately controlled by medications. The primary outcome measure was a rater-blinded assessment of the change in the target limb tremor score in the stimulation-on versus stimulation-off state six months following surgery. Multiple secondary outcomes were assessed at one-year follow-up, including motor, mood, and quality-of-life measures.127 patients were implanted with VIM DBS. The blinded, primary outcome variable (n\u00a0=\u00a076) revealed a mean improvement of 1.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.26 points in the target limb tremor rating scale (TRS) score in the arm contralateral to DBS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Secondary outcome variables at one year revealed significant improvements (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001) in quality of life, depression symptoms, and ADL scores. Forty-seven patients had a second contralateral VIM-DBS, and this group demonstrated reduction in second-sided tremor at 180 days (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Serious adverse events related to the surgery included infection (n\u00a0=\u00a03), intracranial hemorrhage (n\u00a0=\u00a03), and device explantation (n\u00a0=\u00a03).Unilateral and bilateral constant-current VIM DBS significantly improves upper extremity tremor, ADL, quality of life, and depression in patients with severe ET.",

The auditory startle reflex was elicited by 108\u00a0dB loud tones and assessed with electromyography in multiple muscles.Response probability of the early and the late response were significantly enlarged in patients with FMD. The early response showed a normal muscle recruitment pattern whereas the late response revealed a more variable pattern compared to controls. The early and late responses showed normal habituation in both groups. Remarkably, a high response rate of the abdominal muscle was noted especially in patients suffering from abdominal jerks.This study shows enlarged, but normally patterned early startle responses in FMD. The high response frequency of the late responses found in these patients reflects a behavioral component. Hypersensitivity to external stimuli, often noted in FMD is supported by high response probabilities of both components of the auditory startle response.",

The Annual Percent Change (APC) in age-standardized mortality rates was computed both for PD as the UCOD, and by MCOD. The association with common chronic comorbidities and acute complications was investigated by log-binomial regression. The frequency of the mention of PD in death certificates was investigated through linkage with an archive of patients with a previous clinical diagnosis of the disease.PD was reported in 2.1% of all deaths, rising from 1.9% in 2008 to 2.4% in 2015.

We aimed to explore multiple aspects of action control, assessing reward-related behaviour, inhibition (externally and internally triggered) and sense of agency in PD patients, with and without ICB compared to healthy subjects.Nineteen PD patients with ICB (PD-ICB), 19 PD without ICB (PD-no-ICB) and 19 healthy controls (HC) underwent a battery of tests including: Intentional Binding task which measures sense of agency; Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT) measuring capacity for reactive inhibition; the Marble task, assessing intentional inhibition; Balloon Analog Risk Task for reward sensitivity.One-way ANOVA showed significant main effect of group for action binding (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004, F\u00a0=\u00a06.27). Post hoc analysis revealed that PD-ICB had significantly stronger action binding than HC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and PD-no-ICB (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). There was no difference between PD-no-ICB and HC. SSRT did not differ between PD groups, whereas a significant difference between PD-no-ICB and HC was detected (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). No other differences were found among groups in the other tasks.PD patients with ICB have abnormal performance on a psychophysical task assessing sense of agency, which might be related to a deficit in action representation at cognitive/experiential level. Yet, they have no deficit on tasks evaluating externally and internally triggered inhibitory control, or in reward-based decision-making. We conclude that impaired sense of agency may be a factor contributing to ICB in PD patients.",

Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared among four subgroups: group A (without head or voice tremor, n\u00a0=\u00a0619), B (with head but without voice tremor, n\u00a0=\u00a0155), C (with voice but without head tremor, n\u00a0=\u00a047), and D (with both head and voice tremor, n\u00a0=\u00a063).In our patients, total prevalence of tremor was 24.7% for head, 12.4% for voice and 7.1% for the combination of head and voice. Logistic regression analyses showed that female gender is strongly associated with head tremor, which was confirmed by an additional meta-analysis. Severe hand tremor was the only factor associated with voice tremor. Both female gender and severe hand tremor increase the odds for having the combination of head and voice tremor. For males, hand tremor severity is significantly increased among those with head and voice tremor alone and in combination, but for females only for the combination. Patients with both head and voice tremor have more frequent involvement of legs and other localizations and are less responsive to \u03b2-blockers.Female gender and severe hand tremor may increase the odds of head and/or voice tremor in essential tremor. The association of hand tremor severity with midline tremor is stronger for males than females.",

It is not known whether the various manifestations become manifest sequentially during the course of the disease or aggregate in separate clusters identifying subpopulations of patients.Eighty-nine patients with idiopathic blepharospasm were assessed using k-means cluster analysis to identify relatively homogeneous groups on the basis of low-intragroup/high-intergroup differences across a set of selected variables.The results suggest that there may be three groups of patients. Group 1 included patients who had prolonged muscle spasms leading to complete rim closure associated with brief and/or prolonged spasms with incomplete rim closure, the most severe blepharospasm, and a greater tendency to spread to adjacent segments. Group 2 included patients characterized by prolonged spasms with partial rim closure, either alone or associated with brief spasms whereas Group 3 included patients with brief spasms with complete rim closure, the least severe blepharospasm, and the lowest tendency to spread. The severity of Group 2 blepharospasm was between that observed in Group 1 and Group 3, while the tendency to spread was similar to Group 3. The three groups did not differ for disease duration, age of onset, sex and other clinical features. The observation that inhibition of the R2 component of the blink reflex recovery cycle was more abnormal in Groups 1/2 2 than in Group 3\u00a0at least in part validates our classification.The present study suggests that blepharospasm patients may be classified in different subtypes according to the type of spasms, severity of the condition and tendency to spread.",

We therefore suggest guidelines (based on age at onset, family history, associated clinical signs, brain MRI findings as well as certain laboratory investigations), for the diagnosis and the management of PPS.

Primary outcome measures were: anxiety symptoms, measured with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); depressive symptoms, measured with the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15); and insomnia, defined as a score\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 on item 1.7 of the Movement Disorder Society \u2013 Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. We performed linear and logistic regression analyses, correcting for baseline value of the respective outcome variable.Baseline insomnia was not associated with GDS-15 or STAI total score at follow-up. In a post hoc analysis, we found that insomnia predicted a higher STAI State score (B(SE)\u00a0=\u00a02.50 (1.07), p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while the association with the STAI Trait score was not significant.

The relationship between insomnia and anxiety is bidirectional, which suggests that both anxiety and sleep disorders can start a negative spiral in PD patients, where one enhances the other. Independent clinical attention for these symptoms in PD patients is therefore warranted.",

Whole brain functional connectivity of the thalamus and dentate nucleus were calculated by means of a seed-based approach with FEAT script in FSL toolbox. Thalamic volume was calculated by means of FIRST, and the dentate area by means of Jim software.Both thalamic volume and dentate area were significantly smaller in PSP and CBS patients than in healthy subjects. No significant difference emerged in thalamic volume between PSP and CBS patients, whereas dentate area was significantly smaller in PSP than in CBS. Thalamic functional connectivity was significantly reduced in both patient groups in various cortical, subcortical and cerebellar areas. By contrast, changes in dentate nucleus functional connectivity differed in PSP and CBS: it decreased in subcortical and prefrontal cortical areas in PSP, but increased asymmetrically in the frontal cortex in CBS.Evaluating the dentate nucleus size and its functional connectivity may help to differentiate patients with PSP from those with CBS.",

We also performed haplotype analysis in families with a recurrent C19orf12 mutation. Clinical features were collected using a standardized form.Nine of our 15 probands (60%) carried the homozygous c.32C\u00a0>\u00a0T mutation in C19orf12 (predicted protein effect: p.Thr11Met). This homozygous mutation co-segregated with the disease in all affected relatives available for testing (16 homozygous subjects).Haplotypes across the C19orf12 locus were identical for a very small region, closest to the mutation, suggesting an old founder, or, two independent founders. The clinical phenotype was characterized by adult onset in most cases (mean 24.5 years, range 10\u201336), and broad spectrum, including prominent parkinsonism, pyramidal signs, psychiatric disturbances, cognitive decline, and motor axonal neuropathy, in various combinations. On T2- or susceptibility weighted-MRI images, all patients displayed bilateral hypointensities in globus pallidus and substantia nigra, without an eye-of-the-tiger sign; however, hyperintense streaking of the medial medullary lamina between the external and internal parts of globus pallidus was observed frequently.The C19orf12 p.Thr11Met mutation is frequent among adult Turkish patients with MPAN. These findings contribute to the characterization of this important NBIA form, and have direct implications for genetic testing of patients of Turkish origin.",

Training was structured in two 6-weeks phases, allowing to adapt the training according to individual training progress. Rater-blinded clinical assessment (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia; SARA), individual goal-attainment scoring (GAS), and quantitative movement analysis were performed two weeks before training, immediately prior to training, and after training phases 1 and 2 (intra-individual control design). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02874911).After intervention, ataxia symptoms were reduced (SARA -2.5 points, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), with benefits correlating to the amount of training (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Goal attainment during daily living was higher than expected (GAS: 0.45). Movement analysis revealed reduced body sway while sitting (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), which correlated with improvements in SARA posture and gait (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), indicating training-induced improvements in posture control mechanisms.This study provides first evidence that, even in advanced stages, subjects with degenerative ataxia may benefit from individualized training, with effects translating into daily living and improving underlying control mechanisms.

     "abstract": "Nordic Walking is a relatively high intensity activity that is becoming increasingly popular. It involves marching using poles adapted from cross-country skiing poles in order to activate upper body muscles that would not be used during normal walking. Several studies have been performed using this technique in Parkinson disease patients with contradictory results. Thus, we reviewed here all studies using this technique in Parkinson disease patients and further performed a meta-analysis of RCTs where Nordic Walking was evaluated against standard medical care or other types of physical exercise. Nine studies including four RCTs were reviewed for a total of 127 patients who were assigned to the Nordic Walking program. The majority of studies reported beneficial effects of Nordic Walking on either motor or non-motor variables, but many limitations were observed that hamper drawing definitive conclusions and it is largely unclear whether the benefits persist over time. It would appear that little baseline disability is the strongest predictor of response. The meta-analysis of the 4 RCTs yielded a statistically significant reduction of the UPDRS-3 score, but its value of less than 1 point does not appear to be clinically meaningful. Well-designed, large RCTs should be performed both against standard medical care and other types of physical exercise to definitively address whether Nordic Walking can be beneficial in PD.",

However, clinical trials examining the efficacy of intracerebral administration of NTFs on motor symptoms in PD have produced mixed results, and are thus inconclusive. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effects of intracerebral NTF application on motor symptoms in people with PD.We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane from inception through to March 31 2016 for open-label trials and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which intracerebrally administered NTFs to PD patients, and which performed motor examination using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.Eight studies with a total of 223 participants were included. Fixed effects analysis revealed that NTF treatment did not significantly reduce motor symptoms in PD patients compared to placebo controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.98). Combining open-label and RCT data, both treatment with NTFs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and treatment with placebo (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) significantly improved motor function in PD patients when compared to predicted symptoms in untreated PD controls. Finally, random effects analysis revealed that NTF-treated PD patients were not significantly likely to improve following intracerebral NTF administration (P\u00a0=\u00a00.25).In conclusion, intracerebral NTF administration does not improve motor symptoms in PD patients, when compared to placebo-treated controls.

     "abstract": "Anxiety is commonly endorsed in Parkinson's disease (PD) and significantly affects quality of life. The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) is often used but contains items that overlap with common PD motor symptoms (e.g., \u201chands trembling\u201d). Because of these overlapping items, we hypothesized that PD motor symptoms would significantly affect BAI scores.One hundred non-demented individuals with PD and 74 healthy control participants completed the BAI. PD motor symptoms were assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Factor analysis of the BAI assessed for a PD motor factor, and further analyses assessed how this factor affected BAI scores.BAI scores were significantly higher for PD than NC. A five-item PD motor factor correlated with UPDRS observer-rated motor severity and mediated the PD-control difference on BAI total scores. An interaction occurred, whereby removal of the PD motor factor resulted in a significant reduction in BAI scores for PD relative to NC. The correlation between the BAI and UPDRS significantly declined when controlling for the PD motor factor.The results indicate that commonly endorsed BAI items may reflect motor symptoms such as tremor instead of, or in addition to, genuine mood symptoms. These findings highlight the importance of considering motor symptoms in the assessment of anxiety in PD and point to the need for selecting anxiety measures that are less subject to contamination by the motor effects of movement disorders.",

The MoCA is often the only formal cognitive assessment available when comprehensive neuropsychological testing is not practical, such as rural clinical settings or large retrospective and multi-lingual research settings. However, the MoCA domain-specific subsections have never been formally assessed for sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, in Parkinson's disease, we examined whether the subsections of the MoCA could identify cognitive impairment within specific cognitive domains.We administered a comprehensive neuropsychological battery to 85 Parkinson's disease participants, who were then categorized as with or without cognitive impairment, with respect to global cognition and in five cognitive domains. We then assessed the domain-specific categorization of the MoCA subsections compared to the full neuropsychology battery.All MoCA subsections predicted impairment in their respective cognitive domain. However, the executive subsection showed the highest sensitivity and specificity (89.3% and 82.5%, respectively), followed by visuospatial (93.3% and 45.7%, respectively) and memory (84.6% and 56.5%, respectively).The MoCA is a useful screening tool for PD global cognitive and executive functions.

Patients were examined clinically; cortical myoclonic tremor severity was scored by using the Fahn-Tolosa- Marin-Tremor Rating Scale and the Myoclonus Rating Scale. Cortical origin of myoclonus was proven. Statistical analyses were done to assess the impact of cortical myoclonic tremor on quality of life.Clinical data was available for 23 patients. Increase in cortical myoclonic tremor and age showed a statistically significant correlation with worsening of the sub-score for Quality of Life (FTMTRS) and myoclonus rating scale.After 30 years eleven of fourteen patients could be followed up. Progression of cortical myoclonic tremor severity was noted but epilepsy control was adequate with all patients reporting less than two seizures per year. No clinical features of neurodegeneration were found.We describe the initial presentation and 30 year follow-up of a four generation South African family with FCMTE. The unique long term follow up of this pedigree supports previous findings that the condition does not cause additional progressive neurological deterioration and quality of life is mostly influenced by worsening of the cortical myoclonic tremor with age.",

Since hyposmia and gastrointestinal dysfunction are frequently premotor symptoms, it has been speculated that an external, for example microbial, agent could trigger the pathologic process in the corresponding organs, subsequently spreading to the central nervous system. We recently showed evidence for compositional differences between the fecal microbiota of PD patients and control subjects. In this study, our objective was to explore a possible connection between nasal and oral microbiota and PD.We compared the oral and nasal bacterial communities of PD patients (oral: n\u00a0=\u00a072, nasal: n\u00a0=\u00a069) and control subjects (oral: n\u00a0=\u00a076, nasal: n\u00a0=\u00a067) using a 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing approach.Oral and nasal microbiota differed markedly from each other, with no notable similarity within subjects. Oral microbiota of PD patients and control subjects had differences in beta diversity and abundances of individual bacterial taxa. An increase in the abundance of opportunistic oral pathogens was detected in males, both with and without PD.

Our objective was to evaluate the association between SGP and autopsy-proven diagnoses in a large population of patients with parkinsonism referred to a tertiary movement disorders clinic.We reviewed clinical and autopsy data maintained in an electronic medical record from all patients seen in the Movement Disorders Clinic at Washington University, St. Louis between 1996 and 2015. All patients with parkinsonism from this population who had subsequent autopsy confirmation of diagnosis underwent further analysis.221 unique parkinsonian patients had autopsy-proven diagnoses, 27 of whom had SGP documented at some point during their illness. Major diagnoses associated with SGP were: PSP (9 patients), Parkinson disease (PD) (10 patients), multiple system atrophy (2 patients), corticobasal degeneration (2 patients), Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (1 patient) and Huntington disease (1 patient). In none of the diagnostic groups was the age of onset or disease duration significantly different between cases with SGP and those without SGP. In the PD patients, the UPDRS motor score differed significantly between groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) with the PD/SGP patients having greater motor deficit than those without SGP.Although a common feature of PSP, SGP is not diagnostic for this condition and can be associated with other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism including PD.",

However, bilateral stimulation produced greater improvements in step length and double-limb support time than unilateral stimulation, and achieved similar performance for other gait parameters.Contrary to expectations from earlier studies of dual-task motor performance, bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation may assist in maintaining temporal and spatial gait performance under cognitive dual-task conditions.",

The majority of centres reported the use of a multidisciplinary team, biochemistry testing, neurophysiological and neuropsychological tests before and after treatment, in addition to caregivers' training and patient's follow as outpatients. Most centres (60%) used internal guidelines for patient selection. The overall rate of adverse events was 55.1%. Weight loss, chronic polyneuropathy and stoma infection were the most frequently reported. 40% of centres used replacement therapy with Vitamin B12 and Folic acid from the start of LCIG and continued this for the duration of treatment. The rate of discontinuation was of 25.7% overall, with 9.5% of cases occurring in the first year. The main causes of withdrawal were device-related complications, disease progression (comorbidity, severe dementia) and caregiver and/or patient dissatisfaction.In Italy LCIG infusion is managed in a uniform manner at a clinical, practical and organizational level even though the selection criteria are not standardized through the country.

Early detection of relevant cognitive impairment may serve as a predictor for development of psychosis, with implications for prevention and early intervention. However, the exact pattern of cognitive impairment associated with psychosis is not clear. In this article, we aim to critically review the literature on case-control studies in PD patients with and without psychosis in order to understand the pattern of cognitive impairment in those with psychosis. Majority of studies conducted till date have focused on executive and visuospatial functions. Despite some inconsistencies, most of the studies found significant impairment in these domains in PD patients with psychosis compared to those without psychosis. Studies assessing for other cognitive functions such as attention, language and memory in PD patients have also found worse performance in those with psychosis. Although there is enough evidence to suggest that PD patients with psychosis have poor cognitive functioning, it is unclear if these deficits are generalized or specific. The available evidence, which is primarily in the form of cross-sectional studies assessing for specific cognitive deficits, is not adequate to indicate a clear demarcating pattern of cognitive deficits, which differentiates PD patients with and without psychosis. Longitudinal studies with extensive cognitive assessment are warranted.",

We investigated the origins and changes in meaning of these terms over time, particularly in relation to Parkinson's disease (PD). We searched the literature from 1817 to 2015 for use and interpretation of the words akinesia, bradykinesia, hypokinesia, and PD. We found that akinesia and hypokinesia appeared as terms in the 19th century, opposite to hyperkinesia, but were used in the context of PD since 1920, while at the same time the \u2018bradykinetic syndrome\u2019 was introduced. Use of all terms increased in this period due to the encephalitis-lethargica-epidemic, and increased again with the discovery of levodopa from 1961. With the extensive use of criteria sets from the 1980s, bradykinesia replaced akinesia as the most commonly used term. The advent of the internet led to an increase in publications and an associated increase in heterogeneity in the use of the terms. This review shows the variation over time and the lack of unity in the terminology used to describe the range of movement execution disturbances. The current terminology fails to capture the nuances of the challenges we face in documenting these disturbances. We therefore recommend that the current situation may benefit from an objective and computationally solid approach using insights from network and circuitry technology and new developments in assessment technology. It is expected that this will contribute to a new framework for terminology in movement disorders.",

Echogenicity of the substantia nigra and the lenticular nuclei was digitally quantified. Brain sonography data were compared with video-based clinical assessment, genetic status and pedigree charts.The majority of patients had hyperechogenicity of the substantia nigra (79%) and/or the lenticular nuclei (81%). Disease duration correlated with echointensity of lenticular nuclei (Pearson test, r\u00a0=\u00a00.55, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) but not substantia nigra (p\u00a0=\u00a00.31).

The grading of substantia-nigra echogenicity (normal/increased) in patients was in all cases identical to that in their respective asymptomatic relatives. All patients with \u201cfamilial\u201d substantia-nigra normoechogenicity presented with a phenotype of predominant dystonia and only mild parkinsonism. In turn, \u201cfamilial\u201d substantia-nigra hyperechogenicity indicated a phenotype with moderate to severe parkinsonism (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 67%; Fisher test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021).Findings imply early alteration of the substantia nigra in XDP mutation carriers prone to develop parkinsonism. Thus, substantia-nigra hyperechogenicity may be regarded as a preclinical risk marker of parkinsonism-predominant XDP. Furthermore, this biomarker is clustered in some families suggesting the existence of one or more genetic co-factors influencing the phenotype of the disease.",

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is currently used as a global cognitive screening tool and has been recommended as an abbreviated diagnostic tool to measure mild cognitive impairment in the context of global cognitive function. However psychometric properties of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in PD have not been assessed in this context.Data were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (n\u00a0=\u00a0395). We examine psychometric properties of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment among newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease patients using Rasch analysis.Only one item misfit the measurement model and principle component analysis indicated the Montreal Cognitive Assessment was unidimensional. Distribution of items calibrations formed a logical hierarchy from least to most challenging. Test items were markedly off-target (i.e., too easy) for this sample; this was also reflected in low person separation reliability. While 37% of participants performed all items correctly indicating a large ceiling effect, 22% of participants obtained a raw score in the range of 21\u201325 indicating mild cognitive impairment.

Candidate protein biomarkers were identified based on the relative abundances of the identified tryptic peptides. Their predictive performance was evaluated by analysis of the validation set.79 tryptic peptides, derived from 26 proteins were found to differ significantly between atypical parkinsonism patients and controls. They included acute phase/inflammatory markers and neuronal/synaptic markers, which were respectively increased or decreased in atypical parkinsonism, while their levels in PD subjects were intermediate between controls and atypical parkinsonism.Using an unbiased proteomic approach, proteins were identified that were able to differentiate atypical parkinsonian syndrome patients from healthy controls. Our study indicates that markers that may reflect neuronal function and/or plasticity, such as the amyloid precursor protein, and inflammatory markers may hold future promise as candidate biomarkers in parkinsonism.",

Changes in MDS-UPDRS and UDysRS confirm that LCIG treatment can efficiently improve experiences of daily living in advanced PD.",

Cognition was assessed by a battery of tests evaluating functions in the domains of verbal memory, processing speed, executive function and visuospatial abilities.107 of the cohort had moderate to severe fatigue (FSS\u00a0\u2265\u00a04). In univariate correlation analyses high fatigue score was correlated to disease severity, presence of sleep problems, depressive symptoms, apathy, reduced processing speed and reduced visuospatial abilities. In a multiple regression analysis only disease severity (measured by the UPDRS part 3), sleep problems, depressive symptoms and reduced visuospatial abilities contributed to the model.Fatigue is associated with visuospatial function in early PD patients. Further studies are needed to determine the pathophysiologic relevance of this association.",

The goal of this study was to learn if they can develop a three dimensional (3D) percept that depends on the kinetic depth effect; that is, the viewer's ability to spatially integrate over time images that are moving along many trajectories.Sixteen patients with PD and 12 healthy matched controls were presented with stimuli that were comprised of a circular region of randomly placed dots that moved as orthographic projections of a sphere. With a normal kinetic depth effect, the Training stimuli appear as an opaque rotating ball and the Test stimuli appear as a rotating transparent ball.Whereas all controls and all PD patients reported seeing the Training stimuli as a rotating ball, the patients with PD were significantly less likely to report the Test stimuli appearing as a 3D \u201cball\u201d than were the healthy participants. Instead, seven PD patients often reported these bidirectional stimuli appeared \u201cflat.\u201dThis study has revealed that some patients with PD have impaired spatio-temporal integration of bidirectional visual motions, but the mechanism accounting for this loss, as well as why only some patients had this deficit, needs further study. When the driver of a moving vehicle fixates upon a stationary target in the surroundings, bidirectional retinal image motions may occur. Failure to perceive 3D structure in such moving scenes can be plausibly suspected to contribute to adverse events such as auto accidents.",

It is clear that what PD patients understand as constipation may be more complex than previously realized and does not appear to be characterized by decreased stool frequency alone.",

Following the discovery of the PD-causing D620N mutation in the VPS35 (Vacuolar sorting protein 35) gene, dysfunction in the subcellular retromer complex has been strongly implicated in pathogenesis of PD. Although the function and dysfunction of the retromer has been a focus of study for some time, the role of this complex in the development of PD is not fully understood. Investigating cellular alterations that occur when the retromer is rendered dysfunctional, such as when the D620N disease-causing mutation is introduced into various model systems, shows that endosomal processing defects are major contributors to the disease phenotype. Altered trafficking of retromer cargo molecules, reduced cellular survival and altered processing of alpha-synuclein have all been observed in the presence of the D620N mutation. In addition, interactions between the retromer and the protein products of other familial Parkinsonism-related genes, has made the retromer a prime target of research in PD. This review gives an overview of the changes in retromer function, identified thus far, that may contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in PD.",

Currently, the neurological phenotype of aceruloplasminemia has been mainly described in Japanese patients. This \u2018classical\u2019 phenotype consists of cerebellar ataxia, hyperkinetic movement disorders and cognitive decline. In this study we describe the spectrum of neurological disease in Caucasian patients.Data on neurological presentation and follow-up were gathered from both our patients, homozygous for the G631R mutation in the CP gene, and other published Caucasian cases. Neurological features of aceruloplasminemia in Caucasian patients were compared to those summarized in Japanese patients.21 Caucasian patients, both ours and the described cases, displayed a wide range of movement disorders with predominant chorea, parkinsonism and ataxia, and also tremor and dystonia. In addition to cognitive decline, nearly half of the Caucasian patients presented with psychiatric changes, including depression, anxiety and behavioral changes. In one-third of the neurologically symptomatic Caucasian patients, cognitive- or psychiatric changes were the first neurological manifestations of aceruloplasminemia.Aceruloplasminemia in Caucasian patients can present with a wider range and a different order of neurological symptoms than previously described in Japanese patients. Psychiatric changes and parkinsonism can be added to the spectrum of neurological disease. Cognitive- or psychiatric changes may be the first neurological manifestations of aceruloplasminemia.",

We collected the patients' demographic and clinical data. RET was clinically characterized in terms of latency, severity and body side affected. We also investigated a possible relationship with motor and non-motor symptoms and differences in the clinical features in patients with and without RET.RET was present in 42/210 patients. The mean latency of RET was 9.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8 seconds. Mean severity was 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9. RET was unilateral in 21 patients. Patients with RET had less severe speech, posture and gait disorders and upper limb and global bradykinesia than patients without RET. Similar findings were observed when we compared patients with RET with patients with tremor at rest associated with action tremor, patients with isolated action tremor and patients with no tremor. By contrast, patients with RET tremor did not clinically differ from those with isolated tremor at rest.Our results suggest that patients with RET and patients with isolated tremor at rest represent the same clinical subtype, whereas patients with action tremor (whether isolated or associated with tremor at rest) might belong to a distinct subtype that is clinically worse.

However, it is unclear how disease course changes internal standards of QoL over time.124 PD patients were subdivided based on Total UPDRS change over 1 year (stable, improved, declined). The EuroQol Visual Analog Scale assessed QoL at baseline (T1) and 1 year later (T2). At T2, patients rated current QoL (T2-current) and reappraised their T1 QoL (T2-retrospective). Recalibration response shifts were represented by the difference between T1 and T2-retrospective QoL ratings.At follow-up (T2), the total patient sample reported no difference between current (T2 current mean (M)\u00a0=\u00a076.3) and retrospective (T2-R M\u00a0=\u00a077.8) QoL ratings.

While improvements in motor functioning can be easily assessed with general quality of life questionnaires, the measurement of specific STN-DBS-associated impairments often remains insufficient. Hence, we aimed to develop a questionnaire that measures STN-DBS-related impairments.The development of the (STN-)DBS Impairment Scale (DBS-IS) consisted of four steps. First, 30 semi-structured interviews before, three and twelve months after STN-DBS-surgery were performed to create 76 items that relate to motor and non-motor functioning in STN-DBS PD patients. Second, pilot-testing led to a rewording of the questions for better understanding. Third, a first multicentre survey was performed to reduce items by applying principal component analysis (PCA). Fourth, a second multicentre survey was conducted to examine factor structure, reliability (internal consistency) and validity.After the first survey (N\u00a0=\u00a0215), the PCA lead to a reduction of 54 items. After the second survey (N\u00a0=\u00a0391), exploratory factor analysis determined six factors with 22 items: 1. Postural instability and gait difficulties (5 items), 2. Cognitive impairment (5 items), 3. Speaking problems (3 items), 4. Apathy (3 items), 5. Impulsivity (3 items), and 6. Difficulties related to the DBS device (3 items). High reliability was reported for all subscales (Cronbach's alpha 0.71\u20130.90).

The iron chelator deferiprone (DFP) was used in the PD model rat to examine the relationship between iron and the echo signal.Rat models were created using stereotactic injections of 6-OHDA. DFP was administered intragastrically. Transcranial sonography (TCS) was performed to observe the substantia nigra (SN) echo signal of the brain. Immunofluorescence and iron staining were performed to observe the histological characteristics of the hyperechogenic area. The imaging findings were compared with the histopathological findings.The PD model rat presented a large area of hyperechogenicity in the SN. Ferric ion accumulation and microglia proliferation occurred in the hyperechogenic area. DFP inhibited dopaminergic (DA) neuron necrosis, ferric ion accumulation and microglia proliferation and reduced the hyperechogenic area of the SN.Both iron aggregation and gliosis contribute to the formation of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (SNH) in PD. DFP exhibits a neuroprotective effect by inhibiting SNH. Iron deposit and the SNH are correlated with DA neuron necrosis.",

Spatial performance deficits might thus constitute very early signs of dopamine depletion independent of the presence of MCI in Parkinson's disease.",

     "abstract": "30\u201340% of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience depression during their illness; identifying subtypes of depression and groups at risk remains a challenge in routine clinical care. One avenue that remains underexplored is the gender-specific profiles manifested in PD depression. We sought to explore this in a large sample of clinical PD patients.307 patient records at a tertiary referral centre were reviewed for clinical and demographic factors. We used recursive partitioning to determine which items on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were most useful in differentiating patients who scored in the depressed range (\u226514) from those who scored in the non-depressed range (\u226413). We also used recursive partitioning to identify those BDI items that were most effective in differentiating depressed from non-depressed patients in both genders.We were able to identify a subset of items on the BDI that were most useful in partitioning depressed from non-depressed in the entire cohort. Partitioning of men and women with PD depression relied on different key BDI items, melancholy featuring prominently in women, while the more classical factors associated with depression in PD (apathy and loss of libido) featured more prominently in men.Unique factors not previously identified as core features of depression in PD were found most useful in partitioning depressed women from non-depressed women. This raises the possibility that a female-specific depressive profile has been under-appreciated in past work. Additional studies are required to discern how this may impact future research, diagnosis and treatment.",

     "abstract": "Dystonia is a hyperkinetic movement disorder that can be highly stigmatizing and disabling. Substantial evidence from animal models, neuropathological, neurophysiological, neuroimaging and clinical studies emphasizes the role of dopaminergic dysfunction in the pathophysiology of dystonia, illustrating possible pathophysiological overlap with parkinsonism. Furthermore, basal ganglia dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of dystonia, and is well established to underlie the manifestations of Parkinson's disease. Clinically, parkinsonian features are a key characteristic of some combined dystonias, including dopa-responsive dystonia, and Parkinson's disease often presents with dystonia. Moreover, many treatments effective in Parkinson's disease, both medical and surgical, also offer some benefit in dystonia. Therefore, mild parkinsonian features might logically accompany idiopathic and inherited isolated dystonias. However, as the current literature is particularly scant, the present review aimed to investigate mild parkinsonism in idiopathic and inherited dystonia. We found limited evidence alluding to the presence of mildly reduced arm-swing, increased tone, and non-decremental bradykinesia in adult-onset focal dystonia. Tremor, with postures, action and rest, also occurs commonly in idiopathic isolated dystonia, and can simulate Parkinson's disease tremor and be a cause of \u2018scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit\u2019. Parkinsonian features in monogenic isolated dystonias have been less well investigated, despite the potential benefit of correlating pathophysiological and clinical findings. The recognition and improved clinical characterization of parkinsonian features in idiopathic and inherited isolated dystonia extends the clinical spectrum of motor features in dystonia, which may help avoid incorrect diagnosis and inform therapeutic research.",

Irritative symptoms predominate and urodynamic studies confirm high prevalence of detrusor overactivity in PD. LUTS are present early in PD and are more common in PD than in age matched controls. The assessment of LUTS in PD is complicated by coexisting bradykinesia and cognitive impairment. Although LUTS become more troublesome as PD progresses it remains unclear if LUTS severity correlates with motor symptoms and/or duration of PD. The underlying cause of LUTS in PD remains to be fully elucidated. Animal and human studies suggest the net effect of the basal ganglia is to supress micturition.Although LUTS are a common in PD, few studies have examined the assessment and management of LUTS specifically in patients with PD. Pilot studies have suggested that bladder training, antimuscarinic drugs and intravesical botulinum toxin maybe helpful but these trials have been small and frequently lacked a suitable control group making them vulnerable to the placebo effect. Furthermore the adverse effects of antimuscarinic drugs on cognitive and gastrointestinal function may limit the use of these drugs in PD.In this review we summarise the literature describing the prevalence of LUTS in PD, discuss the emerging data delineating the underlying pathophysiology of LUTS and examine interventions helpful in the management of LUTS in people with PD.",

     "abstract": "Although Parkinson's Disease (PD) is mostly considered a motor disorder, it can present at early stages as a non-motor pathology. Among the non-motor clinical manifestations, depression shows a high prevalence and can be one of the first clinical signs to appear, even a decade before the onset of motor symptoms. Here, we review the evidence of early dysfunction in neural circuitry associated with depression in the context of PD, focusing on pre-clinical, pre-motor and early motor phases of the disease. In the pre-clinical phase, structural and functional changes in the substantia nigra, basal ganglia and limbic structures are already observed. Some of these changes are linked to motor compensation mechanisms while others correspond to pathological processes common to PD and depression and thus could underlie the appearance of depressive symptoms during the pre-motor phase. Studies of the early motor phase (less than five years post diagnosis) reveal an association between the extent of damage in different monoaminergic systems and the appearance of emotional disorders. We propose that the limbic loop of the basal ganglia and the lateral habenula play key roles in the early genesis of depression in PD. Alterations in the neural circuitry linked with emotional control might be sensitive markers of the ongoing neurodegenerative process and thus may serve to facilitate an early diagnosis of this disease. To take advantage of this, we need to improve the clinical criteria and develop biomarkers to identify depression, which could be used to determine individuals at risk to develop PD.",

Data were extracted on timing of delivery of drugs, number of co-morbidities and length of stay. Statistical analysis used linear regression adjusting for within admission clustering.431 individuals provided data from a total of 737 admissions. 39% of scheduled l-dopa doses were either not given or administered over 30\u00a0min later than the scheduled time. There was no association between the omission or timing of a dose of PD medication and length of stay in hospital. The number of coded diagnoses was strongly associated with length of stay with a dose-response association (pTREND<0.001). Those with 10 concurrent diagnoses had a 11 day longer stay (95% confidence intervals:\u00a0+2 to\u00a0+21) than those with no comorbidities.Delayed administration of dopaminergic drugs is not associated with prolonged length of stay of in patients with PD who were admitted to hospital as an emergency. However, the number of co-existing medical diagnoses was associated with length of stay, and early attention to these has the potential to improve patient care and decrease length of stay in hospital.",

We assessed whether injured U.S. ED admissions with PD diagnoses were more likely to exhibit comorbid fall- or non-fall related bone fractures and whether a PD diagnosis with a concomitant fall or bone fracture is linked to worse prognosis.We performed secondary analyses of 2010 Healthcare Utilization Project National ED Sample from 4,253,987 admissions to U.S. EDs linked to injured elderly patients. ED discharges with ICD-9-CM code (332.0) were identified as PD and those with ICD-9-CM code (800.0\u2013829.0) were used to define bone fracture location. Linear and logistic regression models were constructed to estimate slopes (B) and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).PD admissions had 28% increased adjusted prevalence of bone fracture. Non-fall injuries showed stronger relationship between PD and bone fracture (ORadj\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95% CI: 1.22\u20131.45) than fall injuries (ORadj\u00a0=\u00a01.06, 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.10). PD had the strongest impact on hospitalization length when bone fracture and fall co-occurred, and total charges were directly associated with PD only for fall injuries. Finally, PD status was not related to in-hospital death in this population.Among injured U.S. ED elderly patient visits, those with PD had higher bone fracture prevalence and more resource utilization especially among fall-related injuries.

Two different cohorts were analyzed: A PD/healthy control that included PD patients and HC as well as a PD/diseased control cohort for which patients PD, MSA and PSP were recruited. The former cohort was exploited to calculate cut-off values that discriminate PD patients from HC with a sensitivity (sensitivity-weighted cut-off) or specificity (specificity-weighted cut-off) exceeding 95%, respectively. The PD/diseased controls cohort was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy using these cut-off values in discriminating patients with neurodegenerative parkinsonism.PD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a067) performed significantly worse in olfactory testing than HC (n\u00a0=\u00a041) and patients with MSA (n\u00a0=\u00a023) or PSP (n\u00a0=\u00a023). There was no significant difference in olfactory function between MSA and PSP patients. Diagnostic performance of the identification subscore was similar to the sum score of the Sniffin\u2019 Sticks test (AUC identification test 0.94, AUC sum score 0.96), while threshold and discrimination subscores were inferior. In patients with parkinsonism, the specificity-weighted cut-off predicted a diagnosis of PD with a sensitivity and specificity of 76.6 and 87.0%, respectively. The discriminative value of this cut-off in separating PD from MSA was 76.7% (sensitivity) and 95.7% (specificity). The corresponding, prevalence-adjusted positive predictive value of olfactory testing exceeded 95%.Our data suggest that assessment of olfactory function, particularly odor identification, can be useful to discriminate PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders, particularly MSA patients.",

However, it is unclear how well patient-based ratings of the levodopa response correlate with clinician-based ratings, and whether this correlation differs between motor symptoms. Here we compare patient-clinician agreement for the effect of levodopa on resting tremor and bradykinesia/rigidity. Furthermore, given patients' reports that tremor is most troublesome during stress, we test for differences in patient-clinician agreement between tremor at rest and stress-induced tremor.We included 42 tremulous Parkinson patients, who were clinically rated (using the MDS-UPDRS) in a practically defined OFF-state and after levodopa-benserazide 200/50\u00a0mg. Using accelerometry, we quantified the effect of dopaminergic medication and behavioral context (rest vs. cognitive stress) on tremor intensity. Patients rated medication effects on tremor and bradykinesia/rigidity using visual analogue scales.There was only moderate patient-clinician agreement for the effect of levodopa on bradykinesia/rigidity (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.18; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and a tendency towards larger agreement for tremor (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.44; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; difference between correlation coefficients: z\u00a0=\u00a01.64; p\u00a0=\u00a00.051).

Twenty-six matched, healthy volunteers were tested, only without L-DOPA.Patients and healthy controls had similar proportions of responders and non-responders to plasticity induction. In the untreated state, the more efficient was the cerebellar modulation of motor cortex plasticity, the lower were the bradykinesia and rigidity scores. The extent of the individual plastic response to paired associative stimulation could indicate a vulnerability to develop early motor fluctuation but not dyskinesia.Measuring motor cortex plasticity in denovo Parkinson's disease could be a neurophysiological parameter that may help identify patients with greater propensity for early motor fluctuations.",

     "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is characterized by frequent falls which worsen with disease progression, causing substantial morbidity and mortality. Few studies have investigated which factors contribute to falls in PSP, and all have involved few participants, thus lacking necessary statistical power. The aim of this study was to identify clinical parameters most significantly associated with increasing falls in PSP, using the largest sample of patients to date.Comprehensive clinical data were collected from 339 not demented PSP patients meeting the NINDS-SPSP criteria, who were divided into two groups \u2013 Infrequent Fallers (IF; n\u00a0=\u00a0118) with rare falls, and Frequent Fallers (FF; n\u00a0=\u00a0221) who fell occasionally to multiple times a day. Of 198 clinical parameters, we hypothesized 38 to be correlated with an increasing risk of falls. These 38 parameters were analyzed via univariate regression analysis to determine the strength of their association with fall frequency. Unit odds ratios identified the magnitude with which each parameter resulted in an increasing risk of falls.Twenty-five of 38 parameters analyzed were significantly associated with fall frequency based on univariate analysis. Symptom duration, clinical measures of disease severity, and several motoric and oculomotor clinical parameters were associated with FF. Examined cognitive parameters and slowing of vertical saccades were not.The clinical parameters identified as associated with increased frequency of falls improve our understanding of why they occur and may help identify not demented PSP patients at risk for increasing falls.",

Moreover, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of tau, p-tau and amyloid A\u03b242 were measured in these patients and in an additional cohort of 5 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic p.A53T carriers without an initial manifestation of dementia.Both patients exhibited an early onset frontal-dysexecutive dysfunction with apathy and emotional blunting resembling frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Motor symptoms typical of Parkinson's disease appeared only later in the disease course and were less prominent than cognitive ones, which included language impairment. Autonomic dysfunction and myoclonus also emerged in a more advanced disease stage. In both patients, Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed fronto-temporo-parietal atrophy, and CSF analysis showed elevated tau protein levels. In contrast, tau protein levels were normal in a cohort of 7 other p.A53T mutation carriers (5 symptomatic/2 asymptomatic). A screen of Greek patients presenting with frontotemporal dementia failed to identify any additional subjects with the p.A53T SNCA mutation.Although cognitive decline has been recognized as a feature of the full-blown clinical picture of p.A53T related parkinsonism, a predominant frontotemporal dementia-like phenotype at presentation has not been previously described. This may represent a subtype of this disorder, with distinctive clinical, imaging and CSF biochemical characteristics, in which additional genetic or epigenetic factors may play a role.",

The extent of the depletion is greater than can be accounted for by loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals alone. We used putamen tissue levels and ratios of cysteinyl and parent catechols to explore possible denervation-independent abnormalities of dopamine synthesis and fate in PD and MSA. 5-S-Cysteinyldopa (Cys-DOPA) is produced from spontaneous oxidation of DOPA and 5-S-cysteinyldopamine (Cys-DA) from spontaneous oxidation of DA.Post-mortem putamen tissue samples from 17 PD and 25 MSA patients and 30 controls were assayed for endogenous catechols including DA, its cytoplasmic metabolites (Cys-DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde), and tyrosine hydroxylation products proximal to DA (DOPA and Cys-DOPA).The PD and MSA groups did not differ in mean values of parent or cysteinyl catechols, and the data for the two groups were lumped. In the patients an index of vesicular storage of DA (the ratio of DA to the sum of its cytoplasmic metabolites) averaged 54% of control (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and an index of L-aromatic-amino-acid decarboxylase (LAAAD) activity (the ratio of DA and the sum of its cytoplasmic metabolites to the sum of DOPA\u00a0+\u00a0Cys-DOPA) averaged 21% of control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). An index of innervation (the sum of DOPA\u00a0+\u00a0Cys-DOPA) averaged 63% of control (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).Based on patterns of parent and cysteinyl catechols in putamen, PD and MSA involve decreased vesicular uptake and decreased LAAAD activity in the residual dopaminergic terminals.

The atypical Parkinsonian (AP) disorders have some features of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) but often with poor or transient levodopa response [1], distinct symptom profiles, more rapid progression and reduced survival. They have significant symptom burden [2]. It is beginning to be appreciated that AP disorders not only carry a heavy symptom burden equivalent to that of patients with advanced cancer but that AP patients experience significant morbidity for an extended period of time. PSP and MSA patients reach clinical milestones such as wheelchair-dependence or frequent falls early in the course of their disease and can live with these accumulating burdens for some years [3]. The acknowledgement of the benefits of emphasizing quality of life in progressive disorders and the growing evidence for palliative care need in non-malignant conditions suggests that MSA and PSP would benefit from an integrated palliative approach. Studies to determine palliative need and possibility of benefit from intervention are beginning to yield results in Parkinsonian conditions. This review aims to discuss the trajectory of disease in MSA and PSP, explore significant symptoms and summarize some evidence which exists for palliative care need and quality of life in these conditions. The challenges of a palliative approach with this group including advance care planning will also be discussed.",

Parkinsonian retinopathy is associated with impaired color discrimination and contrast sensitivity. Some prior studies described associations between color discrimination deficits and cognitive deficits in PD, suggesting that contrast discrimination deficits are due, at least in part, to cognitive deficits in PD. We investigated the relationship between cognitive deficits and impaired contrast sensitivity in PD.PD subjects, n\u00a0=\u00a043; 15F/28M; mean age 66.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2, Hoehn and Yahr stage 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6, and duration of disease of 6.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0 years underwent neuropsychological and Rabin contrast sensitivity testing.Mean Rabin contrast sensitivity score was 1.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40.

LEPs recording show a N2/P2 complex mostly generated by the anterior cingulate cortex, preceded by an earlier negative component (N1), originating from the opercular cortex. Previous work demonstrated N2/P2 amplitude reduction in PD patients and suggested a centrally-acting pathomechanism for the genesis of pain. However, since a peripheral deafferentation has been recently demonstrated in PD, it is not clear if such LEP abnormalities reflect a mechanism acting centrally or not.To assess whether abnormalities of nociceptive inputs occur at central and/or peripheral level in pain-free PD patients with hemiparkinson using Nd:YAP LEPs.We recorded scalp Nd:YAP-LEPs to hand stimulation in 13 pain-free patients with unilateral PD and in 13 healthy subjects. Additionally, we collected laser pain-rating in both groups.PD patients and normal subjects showed comparable N1, N2 and P2 latencies. The N2/P2 amplitude was significantly lower in PD patients than in controls, regardless of the clinically affected side, whereas the N1/P1 amplitude was not different. PD patients had higher pain-rating, indicative of hyperalgesia.These findings demonstrate that in the PD patients the abnormal processing of pain stimuli occurs at central rather than peripheral level. The co-existence of hyperalgesia and reduced amplitude of the N2/P2 complex, in spite of a normal N1/P1 component, suggests an imbalance between the medial and lateral pain systems. Such a dissociation might explain the genesis of central pain in PD.",

Patients were classified into tertile groups based on the frequency, duration, and intensity of the exercises in which they participated.Among patients with mild to moderate reductions in striatal dopaminergic activity (above the median dopaminergic activity), the exercise group of the highest tertile showed significantly lower motor scores (i.e., fewer motor deficits, 15.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.25), despite similar degrees of dopamine reduction, compared to the combined group of the middle and the lowest tertiles (21.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).

     "abstract": "Essential tremor is a highly prevalent movement disorder characterized by kinetic tremor and mild cognitive-executive changes. These features are commonly attributed to abnormal cerebellar changes, resulting in disruption of cerebellar-thalamo-cortical networks. Less attention has been paid to alterations in basic emotion processing in essential tremor, despite known cerebellar-limbic interconnectivity.In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that a psychophysiologic index of emotional reactivity, the emotion modulated startle reflex, would be muted in individuals with essential tremor relative to controls.Participants included 19 essential tremor patients and 18 controls, who viewed standard sets of unpleasant, pleasant, and neutral pictures for six seconds each. During picture viewing, white noise bursts were binaurally presented to elicit startle eyeblinks measured over the orbicularis oculi.Consistent with past literature, controls' startle eyeblink responses were modulated according to picture valence (unpleasant\u00a0>\u00a0neutral\u00a0>\u00a0pleasant). In essential tremor participants, startle eyeblinks were not modulated by emotion. This modulation failure was not due to medication effects, nor was it due to abnormal appraisal of emotional picture content.Neuroanatomically, it remains unclear whether diminished startle modulation in essential tremor is secondary to aberrant cerebellar input to the amygdala, which is involved in priming the startle response in emotional contexts, or due to more direct disruption between the cerebellum and brainstem startle circuitry. If the former is correct, these findings may be the first to reveal dysregulation of emotional networks in essential tremor.",

All participants indicated that they would recommend the class to others with PD. 21/22 participants enjoyed the class and felt it was beneficial for their symptoms. A significant improvement pre-to-post intervention was seen with the UPDRS part II ADL measure (mean\u00a0\u22121.5, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019).A novel improvisation program can be well-attended, enjoyable, and improve ADL measures among patients with PD of varying ages and disease severity.",

     "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is effective in reducing motor symptoms for many individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, STN DBS does not appear to influence speech in the same way, and may result in a variety of negative outcomes for people with PD (PWP). A high degree of inter-individual variability amongst PWP regarding speech outcomes following STN DBS is evident in many studies. Furthermore, speech studies in PWP following STN DBS have employed a wide variety of designs and methodologies, which complicate comparison and interpretation of outcome data amongst studies within this growing body of research. An analysis of published evidence regarding speech outcomes in PWP following STN DBS, according to design and quality, is missing. This systematic review aimed to analyse and coalesce all of the current evidence reported within observational and experimental studies investigating the effects of STN DBS on speech. It will strengthen understanding of the relationship between STN DBS and speech, and inform future research by highlighting methodological limitations of current evidence.",

The underlying mechanisms of these symptoms are not fully understood. An increased interest in structural connectivity analyses using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in PD has led to an expansion of our understanding of the impact of abnormalities in diffusivity on phenotype. This review outlines the contribution of these abnormalities to symptoms of PD including bradykinesia, tremor and non-tremor phenotypes, freezing of gait, cognitive impairment, mood, sleep disturbances, visual hallucinations and olfactory dysfunction. Studies have shown that impairments in cognitive functioning are related to diffusion abnormalities in frontal and parietal regions, as well as in the corpus callosum and major fibres connecting midbrain and subcortical structures with the neocortex. However, the impact of diffusion alterations on motor, mood and other symptoms of PD are less well understood. The findings presented here highlight the challenges faced and the potential areas of future research avenues where DTI may be beneficial. Larger cohort studies and standardized imaging protocols are required to investigate current promising preliminary findings.",

Research has been hampered by the variable definition of ET and by non-standardized research approaches. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (USA) invited experts in ET and related fields to discuss current knowledge, controversies, and gaps in our understanding of ET and to develop recommendations for future research. Discussion focused on phenomenology and phenotypes, therapies and clinical trials, pathophysiology, pathology, and genetics. Across all areas, the need for collaborative and coordinated research on a multinational level was expressed. Standardized data collection using common data elements for genetic, clinical, neurophysiological, and pathological studies was recommended. Large cohorts of patients should be studied prospectively to collect bio-samples, characterize the natural history of the clinical syndrome including patient-oriented outcomes, investigate potential etiologies of various phenotypes, and identify pathophysiological mechanisms. In particular, cellular and system-level mechanisms of tremor oscillations should be elucidated because they may yield effective therapeutic targets and biomarkers. A neuropathology consortium was recommended to standardize postmortem analysis and further characterize neuropathological observations in the cerebellum and elsewhere. Furthermore, genome-wide association studies on large patient cohorts (>10,000 patients) may allow the identification of common genes contributing to risk, and whole exome or genome sequencing may enable the identification of genetic risk and causal mutations in cohorts and well-characterized families.",

Sanger sequencing of the identified mutation in the first set of the study was performed in additional 270 PD patients, including 139 familial PD and 131 early-onset PD (onset age less than 50 years old), and 300 age/gender matched control subjects.We found a missense variant, p.I2012T, in the LRRK2 gene in one sporadic patient having early-onset frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism and dystonia. Sanger sequencing this substitution in additional 270 PD patients in the second set of the study revealed two additional variant carriers: one having autosomal-dominant familial PD, and one with sporadic PD. The p.I2012T substitution was absent in 300 normal control subjects. Analyzing family members of the proband with p.I2012T revealed co-segregation of the variant and parkinsonism. Clinical presentations, levodopa responses, and Tc99mTRODAT-SPECT imaging findings of this index family were similar to idiopathic PD.Our results revealed clinical heterogeneity of the LRRK2 p.I2012T substitution, and demonstrated the use of targeted NGS for genetic diagnosis in multiplex families with PD or mixed neurodegenerative disorders.",

Accelerometers, and analysis using artificial neural networks (ANN), have shown potential as a method of motor symptom evaluation. This work describes the development of a novel PD disease state detection system informed by algorithms based on data collected in an unsupervised, home environment. We evaluated whether this approach can reproduce patient-completed symptom diaries and clinical assessment of disease state.34 participants with PD wore bilateral wrist-worn accelerometers for 4\u00a0h in a research facility (phase 1) and for 7 days at home whilst completing symptom diaries (phase 2). An ANN to predict disease state was developed based on home-derived accelerometer data. Using a leave-one-out approach, ANN performance was evaluated against patient-completed symptom diaries and against clinician rating of disease state.In the clinical setting, specificity for dyskinesia detection was extremely high (0.99); high specificity was also demonstrated for home-derived data (0.93), but with low sensitivity (0.38). In both settings, sensitivity for on/off detection was sub-optimal. ANN-derived values of the proportions of time in each disease state showed strong, significant correlations with patient-completed symptom diaries.Accurate, real-time evaluation of symptoms in an unsupervised, home environment, with this sensor system, is not yet achievable. In terms of the amounts of time spent in each disease state, ANN-derived results were comparable to those of symptom diaries, suggesting this method may provide a valuable outcome measure for medication trials.",

Knowledge of factors associated with occurrence of insomnia may provide clues for an increased understanding of underlying pathophysiology and facilitate early detection.The objective of this study is to examine the course and factors associated with longitudinal changes in insomnia severity in patients with PD.Analyses were performed in data of the SCOPA-PROPARK cohort, a 5-year longitudinal cohort study (2003\u20132011) of 421 PD patients who have been examined annually. Linear mixed models were used to identify factors associated with longitudinal changes in scores of the SCOPA-SLEEP-Nighttime sleep (NS) problems section. A generalized estimating equations (GEE) analysis was performed to determine which baseline variables were associated with the different aspects of insomnia (sleep initiation or maintenance difficulty).Baseline SCOPA-SLEEP-NS scores were available for 412 patients, of whom 110 (27%) had insomnia (i.e. score\u00a0\u2265\u00a07). Of the remaining 302 patients, 99 (33%) developed insomnia at some point during follow-up. More severe depressive symptoms, motor fluctuations, higher dopamine agonist doses and sleep medication use were independently associated with higher SCOPA-SLEEP-NS scores over time. GEE analysis did not identify an unique set of determinants that affected specific aspects of insomnia.The presence of depressive symptoms, motor fluctuations and the use of higher doses of dopamine agonists are associated with more severe insomnia. Attention to these aspects could potentially contribute to a better management of insomnia symptoms in PD.",

Functional connectivity between the regions of the DMN, specifically in the precuneus, anterior and posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal and temporal and inferior parietal cortices was assessed with seed-to-voxel connectivity; gray matter volume and white matter values were determined using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics.Reduced functional connectivity was observed between the posterior cingulate and medial temporal lobe in PD. Lower cognitive performance, gray matter loss in posterior, medial temporal and parietal areas, and fractional anisotropy reduction in the white matter adjacent to DMN regions were also observed in PD patients compared with healthy controls. Lower DMN functional connectivity correlated with lower verbal and visual memory and visual abilities performance in PD. In addition, lower DMN functional connectivity correlated with lower gray matter volume in the posterior cingulate and precuneus, and with lower white matter fractional anisotropy of the inferior longitudinal and posterior cingulate fasciculi in PD.By combining different neuroimaging techniques and cognitive data, results showed that functional connectivity alteration between the regions of the DMN is associated with lower cognitive performance and gray and white matter abnormalities in PD.",

While many studies describe outcomes and complications related to stimulation therapies, the majority of these are from large academic centers, and results may differ from those in general neurosurgical practice.Using data from both the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), we identified all DBS procedures related to primary placement, revision, or removal of intracranial electrodes. Cases of cortical stimulation and stimulation for epilepsy were excluded.Over 28,000 cases of DBS electrode placement, revision, and removal were identified during the years 2004\u20132013. In the Medicare dataset, 15.2% and of these procedures were for intracranial electrode revision or removal, compared to 34.0% in the NSQIP dataset. In NSQIP, significant predictors of revision and removal were decreased age (odds ratio (OR) of 0.96; 95% CI: 0.94, 0.98) and higher ASA classification (OR 2.41; 95% CI: 1.22, 4.75). Up to 48.5% of revisions may have been due to improper targeting or lack of therapeutic effect.Data from multiple North American databases suggest that intracranial neurostimulation therapies have a rate of revision and removal higher than previously reported, between 15.2 and 34.0%. While there are many limitations to registry-based studies, there is a clear need to better track and understand the true prevalence and nature of such failures as they occur in the wider surgical community.",

The locus coeruleus (LC) has diffuse noradrenergic projections that are thought to play a role in gait function. Enhancement of norepinephrine transmission may improve gait in some PD patients. We hypothesized that the severity of PD pathology, and more specifically, Lewy bodies and neuronal loss in the LC, would correlate with the severity of gait dysfunction in PD.Autopsy data from 51 patients, collected through the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Center, were correlated with clinical gait-related measures, including individual Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II and III questions, total UPDRS Part III scores, and timed up-and-go speed (TUG).Neither the presence nor degree of Lewy body pathology in the LC on autopsy was associated with a higher UPDRS part III gait score. LC tau deposition and frontal Lewy body deposition were not correlated with any of the assessed gait measures. The degree of Lewy body pathology, independent of Braak stage, was positively associated with the severity of motor symptoms overall (UPDRS Part III total score).Neither the degree of Lewy body nor tau pathology in the LC is associated with severity of gait disorders in PD.

A 1-point increase in visuospatial-executive function decreased the chance of reporting a MDS-UPDRS Q1 score of \u201cslight\u201d versus \u201cnormal\u201d by a factor of 0.686 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and each 1 point improvement in delayed recall decreased the odds of reporting \u201cslight\u201d cognitive impairment by a factor of 0.836 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Conversion from a PD patient's report of \u201cnormal\u201d to \u201cslight\u201d cognitive impairment may be associated with changes in visuospatial-executive dysfunction and memory more than other cognitive domains.",

Selected HRV variables were low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF), conventionally considered to be influenced by the sympathetic system and the parasympathetic system respectively.HRV variables, in patients with ET, were significantly different from those detected in PD patients and similar to those of controls while in PD patients, they were significantly different from those of controls. At cut off level of 654\u00a0ms2, LF component correctly distinguished ET patients versus PD with sensitivity, specificity, PPV and accuracy of 100%.

     "abstract": "Apomorphine is often considered an archetypal dopamine agonist used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it can be clearly differentiated from most other commonly used dopamine agonists on the basis of its pharmacology and on its unique clinical profile. Like levodopa and dopamine, apomorphine acts as a potent, direct and broad spectrum dopamine agonist activating all dopamine receptor subtypes. It also has affinity for serotonin receptors, and \u03b1-adrenergic receptors. Apomorphine is usually titrated to a dose that provides an equivalent antiparkinsonian response to that provided by levodopa, and its subcutaneous delivery allows a rapid onset of action, usually within 7\u201310\u00a0min. The mode of apomorphine delivery impacts on its clinical profile so as to provide two very different approaches to therapy in PD. When administered as an acute subcutaneous injection, it induces reliable and rapid relief from OFF periods underscoring its utility as a rescue medication. When given as a subcutaneous infusion, it significantly improves overall daily OFF time and there is also evidence to suggest that, in those patients who replace most or all of their oral drugs with apomorphine infusion, dyskinesia may also improve. In this paper, we review the rich pharmacology of apomorphine and review its efficacy in PD based on data from clinical trials.",

Other options are injections with apomorphine to treat early morning dystonia and random off-periods during daytime, as well as continuously infused subcutaneous apomorphine for random fluctuations in PD patients. Low-dose apomorphine infusions also may be useful in the peri-operative phase, when PD patients may not be able to swallow oral medication.

However, neuroimaging can be used to quantify disease-related morphological changes and specific markers. The cerebral peduncle angle (CPA) has been shown to differentiate clinically diagnosed PSP from other parkinsonian diseases but this result has yet to be confirmed in autopsy-proven disease.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained for 168 patients representing 69 medical facilities. Following randomization, the images were divided into two groups (Type 1 and Type 2) based upon midbrain morphological differences. Two readers were blinded and independently measured the CPA of 146 patients with autopsy-proven progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP; n\u00a0=\u00a054), corticobasal degeneration (n\u00a0=\u00a016), multiple system atrophy (MSA; n\u00a0=\u00a011) and Lewy body disease (n\u00a0=\u00a065).Applying two separate measurement techniques revealed no statistically significant differences in CPA measurements among any study groups regardless of classification measurement approach. The interobserver agreement showed significant differences in measurements using the Type 2 approach.Measuring the CPA on MRI is not a reliable way of differentiating among patients with PSP, corticobasal degeneration, MSA, or Lewy body disease.",

Repetitive speech disorder has been demonstrated in more advanced disease stages and has been considered the speech equivalent of freezing of gait (FOG). We aimed to verify a possible relationship between speech and FOG in patients with PD.Forty-three consecutive PD patients and 20 healthy control subjects underwent standardized speech evaluation using the Italian version of the Dysarthria Profile (DP), for its motor component, and subsets of the Battery for the Analysis of the Aphasic Deficit (BADA), for its procedural component. DP is a scale composed of 7 sub-sections assessing different features of speech; the rate/prosody section of DP includes items investigating the presence of repetitive speech disorder. Severity of FOG was evaluated with the new freezing of gait questionnaire (NFGQ).PD patients performed worse at DP and BADA compared to healthy controls; patients with FOG or with Hoehn-Yahr >2 reported lower scores in the articulation, intellibility, rate/prosody sections of DP and in the semantic verbal fluency test. Logistic regression analysis showed that only age and rate/prosody scores were significantly associated to FOG in PD. Multiple regression analysis showed that only the severity of FOG was associated to rate/prosody score.Our data demonstrate that repetitive speech disorder is related to FOG and is associated to advanced disease stages and independent of disease duration. Speech dysfluency represents a disorder of motor speech control, possibly sharing pathophysiological mechanisms with FOG.",

Speech pathologists grouped patients by final speech outcome (normal speech, voice tremor, or dysarthria). Locations of the active leads were calculated by normalizing the segmented thalamic volumes to those in the Morel atlas. Stimulation volumes within thalamic nuclei, error distances from target, and measures of accuracy were calculated and differences in measures between outcome groups tested.At optimal stimulation, 8 patients had normal speech, 6 had voice tremor, and 4 had mild dysarthria. Stimulation volumes were statistically concentrated within the ventral lateral posterior nucleus (VLp). The percentage of stimulation volume outside the VLp was higher in patients with dysarthria (60% vs. 24%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) or voice tremor (55% vs. 24%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) compared to patients with normal speech outcomes.

Electrodes with lower efficiency for VLp stimulation were more frequent with poor speech outcomes and in patients with persistent voice tremor.Following bilateral DBS for ET, 22% of patients develop a non-disabling dysarthria. Optimal speech outcomes were achieved in 44% of patients and correlated with precise stimulation location within and not outside of the VLp.",

Both, clinical symptoms and pathohistological changes in the ENS occur at early stages and can precede the motor manifestations of PD. Two recent studies reported an association between changes in gut microbiota composition and PD. We hypothesized that alterations in gut microbiota might be accompanied by altered concentrations of short chain fatty acids (SCFA), one main metabolic product of gut bacteria.We quantitatively analyzed SCFA concentrations (using gas chromatography) and microbiota composition (using quantitative PCR) in fecal samples of 34 PD patients and 34 age-matched controls.Fecal SCFA concentrations were significantly reduced in PD patients compared to controls. The bacterial phylum Bacteroidetes and the bacterial family Prevotellaceae were reduced, Enterobacteriaceae were more abundant in fecal samples from PD patients compared to matched controls.Our study confirms the recently reported association between PD and the abundance of certain gut microbiota and shows a reduction in fecal SCFA concentrations (one main metabolic product of certain gut bacteria). The reduction in SCFA might, theoretically, induce alterations in the ENS and contribute to gastrointestinal dysmotility in PD. Prospective longitudinal studies in subjects at risk for PD are required to further elucidate the causal role of gut microbiota and microbial products in the development of PD and PD-associated dysmotility.",

The relationship of subjective PD-related fatigue to tasks combining cognitive and motor effort has never been explored.Forty-four right-handed, non-demented PD patients, 22 with (PD-F) and 22 without (PD-NF) fatigue, were tested using a sensor-engineered glove on their more affected hand. Patients performed sequential opposition finger movements following a metronome at 2\u00a0Hz for 5\u00a0min (cued task), and for another minute following a 2-min rest. The same task was repeated without sustained auditory cueing. Movement time (inter-tapping interval, ITI) and rate, touch duration, percentage of correct sequences and clinical measures (motor and fatigue severity, depression, sleep impairment and apathy) were analysed.In the cued task, motor performance worsened over time (significantly increased ITI and decreased movement rate on the third to fifth minute) in PD-F patients only. In the uncued task, motor performance deteriorated similarly in the two groups. PD-F and PD-NF patients differed in ITI and movement rate deterioration over time only in the cued task, independently from motor severity, depression and sleep impairment. The severity of subjective fatigue complaints significantly correlated with motor performance deterioration in the cued task.PD-related fatigue is associated with performance on an externally cued, attention-controlled motor task, but not with an uncued version of the same task. The finding supports a link between PD-related fatigue and attention-demanding motor tasks, proposing a model of inducible fatigue applicable to future clinical and neuroimaging research.",

The standardized mortality ratio for suicide among PD patients was estimated. In order to identify the clinical correlates of suicide, case-control study was conducted based on retrospective chart review. The 29 suicide cases (age: 62.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.7 years; females: 34.5%) were matched with 116 non-suicide controls (age: 63.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.2 years; females 56.9%) by the year of initial PD evaluation.The SMR for suicide in PD patients was 1.99 (95% CI 1.33\u20132.85). Mean duration from time of initial diagnosis to suicide among cases was 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5 years. Case-control analysis revealed that male, initial extremity of motor symptom onset, history of depressive disorder, delusion, any psychiatric disorder, and higher L-dopa dosage were significantly associated with suicide among PD patients.

In this study we aimed to compare medication use in a representative cohort of people with PD living in care homes in north-east England with those living in their own homes.All people with late stage (Hoehn and Yahr III-V) idiopathic PD, PD dementia, or atypical parkinsonian syndromes under the care of the Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust PD service on 1st January 2015 were identified. Demographic, disease characteristics and medication use data were collected from an audit of medical notes of all those identified.We identified 377 people who met the inclusion criteria, 91 (24.1%) of whom were living in a care home. Disease stage, age and age at disease onset were all significantly higher and levodopa equivalent dose significantly lower in those living in care homes, although disease duration and levodopa dose were not. Greater age, lower levodopa equivalent dose and higher disease stage were independently associated with being in a care home.Although people in care homes had more advanced disease, they were on a significantly lower levodopa equivalent dose. This is likely to be due to the requirement to balance symptom management with drug side-effects.",

There are no treatments currently approved for this disorder. Propranolol, a \u03b2-adrenergic blocker, has been reported to alleviate TD in case series and reports.Retrospective database search of the Emory movement disorder clinic for TD patients treated with propranolol. All patients identified with at least one follow-up evaluation had records reviewed and responsiveness assessed. Logistic regression analysis examined for predictors of response.Forty-seven patients were analyzed, mean age 63 years. Neuroleptics were discontinued in all patients and duration of TD at the time propranolol was initiated 17 months. Mean severity of TD, based on a 0\u20133 scale (0\u00a0=\u00a0none, 1\u00a0=\u00a0mild, 2\u00a0=\u00a0moderate, 3\u00a0=\u00a0severe) was 2.2.

Propranolol resulted in improvement in 64% and 77% of those had a moderate to complete or near-complete response. Mean daily dose was 69\u00a0mg and duration of therapy 14 months. Three patients stopped the propranolol due to adverse effects: hypotension (2), nightmares (1). Severity of TD and duration of propranolol therapy were associated with response.Low dose propranolol appears to be well tolerated and effective in treating TD.

     "abstract": "Reading difficulties are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) but not well studied. We report a case of reading difficulties in a 40-year-old man with 6-year history of PD on dopamine replacement therapy.We performed detailed neuro-ophthalmic examination and assessment of reading with and without infrared oculography.Clinical examination revealed visual acuity of 20/20, no evidence of vision loss, and normal eye movement and ocular alignment with normal saccades, pursuit, and normal convergence. During King-Devick test, a rapid number reading task performed on a book, patient had normal number reading speed. More detailed study of number and word reading using infrared oculography revealed that while this patient had normal speed and eye movement behavior during number reading, he had dramatic slowing and eye movement abnormality during word reading. The slower reading speed during word reading was due to increased number of progressive saccades, smaller saccade amplitudes, increased number of regressive saccades, and longer fixation durations.This case nicely illustrated the importance of comprehensive neuro-ophthalmic evaluations in Parkinson's disease and shows that reading difficulties can arise even when there is good visual acuity, ocular motor abilities necessary to read, and accommodation. In this case, reading difficulty was due to higher order ocular motor planning or cognitive abilities involved in word reading since the patient had no difficulty with ocular motor planning while reading numbers. These findings may have important implications towards our understanding of PD and can serve to spark further research in this important area.",

     "abstract": "Gait impairments are a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), both as early symptom and an important cause of disability later in the disease course. Although levodopa has been shown to improve gait speed and step length, the effect of dopamine replacement therapy on other aspects of gait is less well understood. In fact, falls are not reduced and some aspects of postural instability during gait are unresponsive to dopaminergic treatment. Moreover, many medications other than dopaminergic agents, can benefit or impair gait in people with PD. We review the effects of pharmacological interventions used in PD on gait, discriminating, whenever possible, among effects on four components of everyday mobility: straight walking, gait initiation, turning, gait adaptability. Additionally, we summarize the effects on freezing of gait. There is substantial evidence for improvement of spatial characteristics of simple, straight-ahead gait with levodopa and levodopa-enhancing drugs. Recent work suggests that drugs aiming to enhance the acetylcholine system might improve gait stability measures. There is a lack of well-designed studies to evaluate effects on more complex, but highly relevant walking abilities such as turning and making flexible adjustments to gait. Finally, paucity in the literature exists on detrimental effects of drugs used in PD that are known to worsen gait and postural stability in the elderly population.",

However, recent evidence suggests that relatively low-frequency stimulation (LFS) below 100\u00a0Hz is an option to treat some patients with MDs.We aimed to review the clinical and pathophysiological evidence supporting the use of stimulation frequencies below 100\u00a0Hz in different MDs.Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus at 60\u00a0Hz has provided benefit in gait and other axial symptoms such as swallowing and speech. Stimulation of the pedunculopontine nucleus between 20 and 45\u00a0Hz can provide benefit in freezing of gait, cognition, and sleep quality in select patients with Parkinson's disease. Stimulation of the globus pallidus internus below 100\u00a0Hz in patients with dystonia has provided benefit at the beginning of the therapy, although progressively higher stimulation frequencies seem to be necessary to maintain the clinical benefit. Relative LFS can lower energy requirements and reduce battery usage\u2014a useful feature, particularly in patients treated with high current energy.DBS at frequencies below 100\u00a0Hz is a therapeutic option in select cases of Parkinson's disease with freezing of gait and other axial symptoms, and in select patients with dystonia and other hyperkinetic movements, particularly those requiring an energy-saving strategy.",

Dysfunctions of cerebellar circuits are known to play a role in the pathophysiology of action-induced tremors, and cerebellar impairment has frequently been associated to dystonia. However, a link between dystonic tremor and cerebellar abnormalities has not been demonstrated so far.Twenty-five patients with idiopathic isolated cervical dystonia, with and without tremor, were enrolled. We studied the excitability of inhibitory circuits in the brainstem by measuring the R2 blink reflex recovery cycle (BRC) and implicit learning mediated by the cerebellum by means of eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC). Results were compared with those obtained in a group of age-matched healthy subjects (HS).Statistical analysis did not disclose any significant clinical differences among dystonic patients with and without tremor. Patients with dystonia (regardless of the presence of tremor) showed decreased inhibition of R2 blink reflex by conditioning pulses compared with HS. Patients with dystonic tremor showed a decreased number of conditioned responses in the EBCC paradigm compared to HS and dystonic patients without tremor.The present data show that cerebellar impairment segregates with the presence of tremor in patients with dystonia, suggesting that the cerebellum might have a role in the occurrence of dystonic tremor.",

SVD included the load of white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunes and perivascular spaces (PVS).

Over 18 months, PD SVD-progression demonstrated significant cortical thinning in the left frontal and bilateral parietal regions with associated decline in memory, executive function, and motor functions. PD SVD-progression also had reduced volumes in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala at baseline and greater atrophy in the caudate nucleus over 18 months.The extent and progression of SVD is associated with focal cerebral atrophy and domain-specific cognitive dysfunction.

Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured on the mid-portion of the intraorbital optic nerve. Using a multivariate analysis of variance with repeated measures, longitudinal changes in cognitive subscores of a comprehensive neuropsychological test were evaluated in PD patients according to optic nerve integrity.The mean FA value in PD was significantly lower (0.552\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.103, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than that in DIP (0.645\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.099) or the controls (0.689\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.089), whereas the mean ADC value was significantly higher in the PD group compared to the DIP or control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Several independent studies have shown that 1\u201315% of patients with suspected degenerative parkinsonism, mainly PD, have scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD). It has been proposed that most SWEDD patients either present with a non-degenerative condition mimicking PD, such as atypical tremor or dystonia, or demonstrate an abnormal scan when repeated later. We here hypothesized that scan interpretation methods may also play a crucial yet underestimated role in this issue.We previously established age-dependent reference values of striatal uptake by analyzing scans from a cohort of patients with non-degenerative conditions. We then studied a large population with well-established degenerative parkinsonism (N\u00a0=\u00a0410, 80% with PD), using identical imaging protocol, to evaluate the prevalence of patients with normal scans based on routine visual assessment. Each scan was eventually reassessed using the same automated method as for controls and a detailed 3D analysis.Ten potential SWEDD cases (2.4%) were identified. However, both reassessment methods independently showed that these scans were all outside reference limits and/or visually abnormal when reexamined carefully, except for one case (0.2%) with corticobasal syndrome.SPECT misinterpretation emerges as an important contributor to the SWEDD population, suggesting that suspected SWEDD cases should prompt not only a serious diagnosis challenge but, equally important, a detailed scan reassessment. True SWEDD cases seem extremely rare in degenerative parkinsonism. We propose that the very concept of SWEDD is more confusing than helpful and should be definitely abandoned.",

Patients underwent an extensive clinical and neuropsychological evaluation. Cortical thickness measures and diffusion tensor metrics of white matter tracts were obtained. Random forest analysis was used to identify the strongest MRI predictors of cognitive impairment in PSPs at an individual patient level.PSPs patients were in a moderate stage of the disease showing mild cognitive deficits with prominent executive dysfunction. Relative to controls, PSPs patients had a focal, bilateral cortical thinning mainly located in the prefrontal/precentral cortex and temporal pole. PSPs patients also showed a distributed white matter damage involving the main tracts including the superior cerebellar peduncle, corpus callosum, corticospinal tract, and extramotor tracts, such as the inferior fronto-occipital, superior longitudinal and uncinate fasciculi, and cingulum, bilaterally. Regional cortical thinning measures did not relate with cognitive features, while white matter damage showed a significant impact on cognitive impairment (r values ranging from\u00a0\u22120.80 to 0.74).PSPs patients show both focal cortical thinning in dorsolateral anterior regions and a distributed white matter damage involving the main motor and extramotor tracts.

All-type hallucinations occurred more frequently in DLB-LB, while delusions were common in both groups. Groups were similar in education and age at onset, and in baseline age, dementia severity, and functional capacity.Salient findings included greater impairment on visual tasks and speed of processing and more frequent reports of all-type hallucinations in DLB-LB compared to DLB-AD. Relatively intact confrontation naming in DLB-LB and no differences in reported delusions were of note.

     "abstract": "There is intense interest in identifying cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Parkinson's disease (PD), both for early diagnosis and to track effects of putative treatments. Nigrostriatal dopamine depletion characterizes PD. Predictably, CSF levels of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), the main neuronal metabolite of dopamine, are decreased in PD, even in patients with recent onset of the movement disorder. Whether low CSF DOPAC is associated specifically with parkinsonism has been unclear. In the neuronal cytoplasm dopamine undergoes not only enzymatic oxidation to form DOPAC but also spontaneous oxidation to form 5-S-cysteinyl-dopamine (Cys-DA). Theoretically, oxidative stress or decreased activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) in the residual nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons would increase CSF Cys-DA levels with respect to DOPAC levels. PD, parkinsonian multiple system atrophy (MSA-P), and pure autonomic failure (PAF) are synucleinopathies; however, PAF does not entail parkinsonism. We examined whether an elevated Cys-DA/DOPAC ratio provides a specific biomarker of parkinsonism in synucleinopathy patients.CSF catechols were assayed in PD (n\u00a0=\u00a024), MSA-P (n\u00a0=\u00a032), PAF (n\u00a0=\u00a018), and control subjects (n\u00a0=\u00a032).Compared to controls, CSF DOPAC was decreased in PD and MSA-P (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 each). In both diseases Cys-DA/DOPAC ratios averaged more than twice control (0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 and 0.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 vs. 0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 each), whereas in PAF the mean Cys-DA/DOPAC ratio was normal (0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01).CSF Cys-DA/DOPAC ratios are substantially increased in PD and MSA-P and are normal in PAF. Thus, in synucleinopathies an elevated CSF Cys-DA/DOPAC ratio seems to provide a specific biomarker of parkinsonism.",

Anatomical changes exceeding striatal pathology were not yet described in XDP. The present study aimed to assess the microstructure of white matter tracts in XDP using magnetic resonance tomography.Diffusion-weighted imaging was done in 10 XDP patients, aged 42.2 years (SD 8.1), and 14 ethnicity and age-matched controls, aged 40.2 years (SD 6.4). Based on diffusion tensor images, mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) maps were calculated.Except for in the occipital lobe, XDP patients showed generally increased MD values across the entire white matter. FA map analysis identified four significant clusters with controls showing higher FA values than XDP patients. Involved regions included the fornix, anterior thalamic radiation, corticospinal tract, and superior corona radiata bilaterally. In the fornix and the anterior thalamic radiation, the UPDRSIII total score showed a negative correlation with mean FA values at a trend level (tau\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.40, p\u00a0=\u00a00.053).

However, little is known about the role of LRRK2 in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Aims of this study were to screen DLB patients for pathogenic LRRK2 variants and to evaluate associations between common LRRK2 variants and risk of DLB.417 clinical DLB patients and 1790 controls were included in the primary analysis. Additionally, 355 Lewy body disease patients assessed as having a high likelihood of clinical DLB based on neuropathological findings were included in secondary analysis. Seven pathogenic LRRK2 variants were assessed in patients, while 17 common LRRK2 exonic variants and 1 GWAS-nominated common LRRK2 PD-risk variant were evaluated for association with DLB.We identified carriers of 2 different pathogenic LRRK2 variants. One clinical DLB patient was a p.G2019S carrier, while in the pathological high likelihood DLB series there was one carrier of the p.R1441C mutation. However, examination of clinical records revealed the p.R1441C carrier to have PD with dementia. Evaluation of common variants did not reveal any associations with DLB risk after multiple testing adjustment. However, a non-significant trend similar to that previously reported for PD was observed for the protective p.N551K-R1398H-K1423K haplotype in the clinical DLB series (OR: 0.76, P\u00a0=\u00a00.061).LRRK2 does not appear to play a major role in DLB, however further study of p.G2019S and the p.N551K-R1398H-K1423K haplotype is warranted to better understand their involvement in determining DLB risk.",

A full-night video-PSG to collect standard breathing parameters (apnea/hypopnea index, mean HbSAO2, oxygen desaturation index, total sleep time with HbSaO2 below 90%) was performed in all the patients. Laryngoscopy and EMG investigation of adductor (thyroarytenoid-TA) and abductor (posterior cricoarytenoid-PCA) muscles of the VCs were also performed.Both the laryngeal EMG abnormalities (based on MUAP analysis and kinesiologic EMG investigation of VC muscles) and the laryngoscopic alterations correlated with video-PSG respiratory abnormalities. Specific patterns of EMG findings were consistently found in MSA subjects with nocturnal stridor detected at PSG. In particular, the following EMG findings were related to the severity of breathing abnormalities and the presence of stridor on video-PSG: neurogenic pattern on MUAP analysis of the PCA, paradoxical activation of the TA during inspiration and tonic EMG activity of the TA during quiet breathing.Electromyographic/kinesiologic investigation of VC muscles during wakefulness provides additional information on the pathophysiology of the respiratory abnormalities in MSA patients that could be useful for guiding the choice of the best appropriate treatment and care.",

Several studies demonstrated dopaminergic neuronal loss in Parkinson's disease (PD) using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Hypothetically, restless legs syndrome (RLS) may have an underlying dopaminergic mechanism and a probable relation to PD is assumed. Therefore, we aimed to analyze retinal morphology in RLS patients.In this cross-sectional study we used spectral domain OCT to measure the features of various retinal layers such as thicknesses of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), macular and foveal layers, ganglion cell complex (GCC), and optic nerve head parameters of 36 patients with idiopathic RLS, together with 36 age and sex-matched controls. Differences in the thicknesses of RNFL, macula, GCC and optic disc parameters are statistically compared between patients and controls.The average peripapillary RNFL thickness, mean macular volume and total retinal thickness were reduced in RLS compared with healthy controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029, and p\u00a0=\u00a00.026, respectively). After Bonferroni correction, only the reduction in the inferior inner and outer quadrants of the macula remained significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0040, for both). Optic nerve head parameters (cup volume, cup/disc area ratio, rim area and disc area) and GCC thickness showed no significant difference between patients and healthy controls.Our study revealed significant retinal thinning in the macula region in RLS. Our results may support the dopaminergic dysfunction in the pathogenesis of RLS. Prospective longitudinal studies with a larger sample are needed to corroborate our results.",

Contribution of this synaptic gene related to Parkinsonism phenotypes in other populations still remains unidentified.An ARJP family with two affected siblings characterized by frequent tremor with bradykinesia and rigidity was recruited in this study. Both siblings showed intense dyskinesia and dystonia on administration of Syndopa. The family was analyzed for both mutations and exon dosage variations in PARKIN, PINK1 and DJ1. Further, whole exome sequencing was performed in two affected and one unaffected sibling in the family.We identified a novel homozygous mutation (c.1376C\u00a0>\u00a0G, p.Arg459Pro) in SYNJ1 segregating in this family.

This led to the use of tracheostomy and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) for the prevention of sudden death. However, neither method has been able to prevent sudden death, and both have occasionally precipitated treatment-related complications, including central sleep apneas and exacerbation of floppy epiglottis. Therefore, it is important to determine the mechanisms and prevention of sudden death in MSA.We reviewed the literature on the mechanisms and prevention of sudden death in patients with MSA.Sudden death in MSA is hypothesized to be a consequence of disordered central respiration, suffocation caused by sputum and food, upper airway obstruction from NPPV acting on a floppy epiglottis, cardiac autonomic disturbance, or a combination of these factors.Various factors may be involved in the mechanism of sudden death in MSA. A multidisciplinary approach is needed to prevent sudden death, and this requires an organized system of several medical specialties.

Psychiatric assessment included the MINI\u2013PLUS interview and quantitative questionnaires. Dystonia motor severity (based on video evaluation), pain and disability were determined with the TWSTRS rating scale. In addition, severity of tremor and jerks was evaluated with the 7-point CGI-S scale. HR-QoL was determined with the RAND-36 item Health Survey and predictors of HR-QoL were assessed using multiple regression analysis.In CD patients, the MINI-PLUS revealed a significantly higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders (64% vs. 28%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), with substantially more depression (32% vs. 14%) and anxiety disorders (42% vs. 8%). This was confirmed by the quantitative rating scales. Disease characteristics did not differ between patients with and without a psychiatric diagnosis. HR-QoL in dystonia patients was significantly lowered. The most important predictors of HR-QoL appeared severity of depressive symptoms, pain and disability, but not severity of motor symptoms.Psychiatric co-morbidity is highly prevalent and is an important predictor of HR-QoL in CD patients, rather than dystonia motor severity. Our findings support the theory of a shared neurobiology for motor and non-motor features and highlight the need for systematic research into psychiatric disorders in dystonia. Adequate treatment of psychiatric symptoms could significantly contribute to better overall quality of life of CD patients.",

The functioning of the autonomic nervous system in patients with functional movement disorders (FMD) is of particular interest given the hypothesis that converted psychological stress plays a critical role in FMD disease pathogenesis. We sought to investigate autonomic nervous system activity in FMD patients by examining heart rate variability (HRV), a quantitative marker of autonomic function.35 clinically definite FMD patients and 38 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were hospitalized overnight for continuous electrocardiogram recording. Standard time and frequency domain measures of HRV were calculated in the awake and asleep stages. All participants underwent a thorough neuropsychological battery, including the Hamilton Anxiety and Depression scales and the Beck Depression Inventory.Compared to controls, patients with FMD exhibited decreased root mean square of successive differences between adjacent NN intervals (RMSSD) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), a marker of parasympathetic activity, as well as increased mean heart rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). These measures did not correlate with the depression and anxiety scores included in our assessment as potential covariates.In this exploratory study, patients with FMD showed evidence of impaired resting state vagal tone, as demonstrated by reduced RMSSD. This decreased vagal tone may reflect increased stress vulnerability in patients with FMD.",

     "abstract": "Distinguishing between different tremor disorders can be challenging. Some tremor disorders are thought to have typical tremor characteristics: the current study aims to provide sensitivity and specificity for five \u2018typical\u2019 tremor phenomena.Retrospectively, we examined 210 tremor patients referred for electrophysiological recordings between January 2008 and January 2014. The final clinical diagnosis was used as the gold standard. The first step was to determine whether patients met neurophysiological criteria for their type of tremor. Once established, we focused on \u2018typical\u2019 characteristics: tremor frequency decrease upon loading (enhanced physiological tremor (EPT)), amplitude increase upon loading, distractibility and entrainment (functional tremor (FT)), and intention tremor (essential tremor (ET)). The prevalence of these phenomena in the \u2018typical\u2019 group was compared to the whole group.Most patients (87%) concurred with all core clinical neurophysiological criteria for their tremor type. We found a frequency decrease upon loading to be a specific (95%), but not a sensitive (42%) test for EPT. Distractibility and entrainment both scored high on sensitivity (92%, 91%) and specificity (94%, 91%) in FT, whereas a tremor amplitude increase was specific (92%), but not sensitive (22%). Intention tremor was a specific finding in ET (85%), but not a sensitive test (45%). Combination of characteristics improved sensitivity.In this study, we retrospectively determined sensitivity and specificity for five \u2018typical\u2019 tremor characteristics. Characteristics proved specific, but few were sensitive. These data on tremor phenomenology will help practicing neurologists to improve distinction between different tremor disorders.",

Cases of vCB are identified among those with CB and stroke involving the putamen.A total of 284 cases (in-hospital cases, 11 gCB and 3 vCB; historical cases, 225 gCB and 45 vCB) were included after excluding 23 glycemic cases without HSIs on T1WI and 53 cases with non-glycemic etiologies.Persistence of CB was longer than one month in 84 cases (gCB, 36.9%, and vCB, 63.0%). Extra-putaminal lesions occurred more frequently in vCB (71.1%) than gCB (50.7%). Age, cerebrovascular etiology and extra-putaminal lesions were found to be significant predictors for persistence of CB one month after onset.

MSA was originally considered exclusively sporadic but reports of association with genes such as SNCA, COQ2 and LRRK2 have demonstrated that there is a genetic contribution to the disease. MAPT has been associated with several neurodegenerative diseases and we previously reported a protective association of the MAPT H2 haplotype with MSA in 61 pathologically confirmed cases.In the present study, we assessed the full MAPT haplotype diversity in MSA patients using six MAPT tagging SNPs. We genotyped a total of 127 pathologically confirmed MSA cases, 86 patients with clinically diagnosed MSA and 1312 controls.We identified four significant association signals in our pathologically confirmed cases, two from the protective haplotypes H2 (MSA:16.2%, Controls:22.7%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.024) and H1E (MSA:3.0%, Controls:9.0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), and two from the rare risk haplotypes H1x (MSA:3.7%, Controls:1.3%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.030) and H1J (MSA:3.0%, Controls:0.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021). We evaluated the association of MSA subtypes with the common protective H2 haplotype and found a significant difference with controls for MSA patients with some degree of MSA-C (MSA-C or MSA-mixed), for whom H2 occurred in only 8.6% of patients in our pathologically confirmed series (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).Our findings provide further evidence that MAPT variation is associated with risk of MSA. Interestingly, our results suggest a greater effect size in the MSA-C compared to MSA-P for H2. Additional genetic studies in larger pathologically confirmed MSA series and meta-analytic studies will be needed to fully assess the role of MAPT and other genes in MSA.",

The pathogenesis of tremor in dystonia remains speculative, but its neurophysiological features are similar to dystonia which helps in differentiating it from essential tremor patients. Treatment of tremor in dystonia depends upon the site of involvement.

Recent findings suggest that cutaneous abnormalities like small fiber neuropathy and alpha-synuclein deposition might reflect brain pathology and might function as early biomarkers in PD. This is the first study to elucidate whether iRBD patients already suffer from distinctive cutaneous features.We examined skin punch biopsies from the distal leg of 18 iRBD patients and 22 age- and sex-matched controls using immunohistochemistry and microscopy. Further clinical evaluation included structured interviews, clinical motor and non-motor questionnaires and rating scales (e.g. Unified Parkinson\u2019s disease rating scale [UPDRS], non-motor symptoms questionnaire [NMS-Quest] and Beck Depression Inventory, Epworth Sleepiness Scale, evaluation of cognitive and olfactory functioning as well as blood samples.Intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IEFND) was reduced in iRBD patients compared to controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.037), whereas the axon swelling ratio did not differ between groups. Patients with iRBD reported non-motor symptoms more frequently than controls (UPDRS I, NMS-Quest). Olfaction and daytime sleepiness differed between both groups, whereas there were no differences regarding cognition.These in\u00a0vivo findings demonstrate small fiber neuropathy in iRBD patients that are associated with non-motor symptoms indicating that peripheral abnormalities may occur early in iRBD.

Our aim was to develop a novel automated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based evaluation technique of dopamine transporter SPECT images and to compare its diagnostic accuracy with those of the gold-standard visual grading and manual dopamine transporter binding quantification methods.123I-FP-CIT SPECT and MRI sessions were conducted in 33 patients with PS (15 men; mean age: 60.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.7 years) and 15 patients with ET (8 men; mean age: 54.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.3 years). Striatal dopamine transporter binding was visually classified by 2 independent experts as normal or abnormal grade I, II and III. Caudal and putaminal specific uptake ratios were calculated by both automated MRI-based and manual evaluation techniques.We found almost perfect agreement (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.829) between the visual scores by the 2 observers. The automated method showed strong correlation with the visual and manual evaluation techniques and its diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a097.0%; specificity\u00a0=\u00a093.3%) was also comparable to these methods. The automatically determined uptake parameters showed negative correlation with the clinical severity of parkinsonism.

The mode of feeding and admissions for pneumonia/choking were analyzed. Baseline clinical and demographic variables were compared between feeding groups. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to estimate time to pneumonia/choking. Clinical variables significantly associated with pneumonia/choking free survival were identified using Cox regression.Hospitalisation for pneumonia/choking occurred in 89 out of 194 patients, with the highest admission rate in rejected enteral feeding group (66.7%), followed by enteral feeding (61.8%) and oral feeding (38.8%) groups. The estimates of median time to event were 11, 14, and 47 months for rejected enteral feeding, enteral and oral feeding groups respectively (log-rank test p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Here, we evaluate scheduled DBS applied to TS at two-year follow-up.Five patients underwent bilateral centromedian thalamic (CM) region DBS. A cranially contained constant-current device delivering stimulation on a scheduled duty cycle, as opposed to the standard continuous DBS paradigm was utilized. Baseline vs. 24-month outcomes were collected and analyzed, and a responder analysis was performed. A 40% improvement in the Modified Rush Tic Rating Scale (MRTRS) total score or Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) total score defined a full responder.Three of the 4 patients followed to 24 months reached full responder criteria and had a mean stimulation time of 1.85\u00a0h per day. One patient lost to follow-up evaluated at the last time point (month 18) was a non-responder. Patients exhibited improvements in MRTRS score beyond the improvements previously reported for the 6 month endpoint; on average, MRTRS total score was 15.6% better at 24 months than at 6 months and YGTSS total score was 14.8% better. Combining the patients into a single cohort revealed significant improvements in the MRTRS total score (\u22127.6 [5.64]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).Electrical stimulation of the centromedian thalamic region in a scheduled paradigm was effective in suppressing tics, particularly phonic tics. Full responders were able to achieve the positive DBS effect with a mean of 2.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 (SEM) hours of DBS per day.",

Participants were followed for a maximum of twenty years for the onset of parkinsonism, dementia or death until January 1, 2011 (median follow-up 12.1 years). We studied the relationship between the genetic risk score and incident PD with adjustment for age, sex, smoking and parental history. In an independent sample of 2997 persons free of parkinsonism and dementia, we studied whether the PD risk score was associated with impaired BADL.During follow-up (median 12.1 years), 99 persons were diagnosed with incident PD. The genetic risk score was associated with incident PD (hazard ratio per standard deviation risk 1.25 [95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a01.02; 1.55]), but did not substantially improve prediction (change in C-statistic 0.687 [0.628; 0.745] to 0.698 [0.635; 0.760], \u0394C\u00a0=\u00a00.011 [\u22120.011; 0.033]). The genetic risk score was associated with a higher probability of any impairment in BADL (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.11 [1.00; 1.23]).Genetic variants for PD are associated with the risk of incident PD in the general population and with impairment in daily functioning in individuals without clinical parkinsonism, but do not improve the clinical prediction of PD.

In phase I of the study, we used the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, and the Activities of Daily Living scale to screen for dementia. Any person who was suspected of having dementia underwent a clinical examination, blood tests, and a neuroimaging examination to confirm the diagnosis of dementia. In phase II of the study, we further screened eligible participants for DLB using consensus guidelines for the clinical and pathologic diagnosis of DLB.The overall prevalence of DLB in the total population of 5542 study participants was 1.05%; the prevalence of DLB was 10.10% in the population with dementia.

The effects of muscle vibration (a well-known manipulation of proprioception) could provide the answer to the debate. The aim of this study was to determine whether proprioceptive manipulation, through muscle vibration, could reduce FOG severity.Sixteen PD patients who experience FOG were required to walk with small step lengths (15\u00a0cm). Cylindrical vibration devices were positioned on triceps surae tendon. Three vibration conditions were tested: No vibration (OFF), vibration on the less affected limb (LA), or on the more affected limb (MA). Additionally, we assessed the effects of applying vibration before and after FOG onset. The FOG duration and the foot used to take the next step were assessed.FOG significantly decreased only with vibration of LA in comparison to OFF, and when vibration was applied after FOG onset.Our results show that muscle vibration is a promising technique to alleviate the severity of FOG. Improvements to FOG behavior were restricted to the less affected limb, suggesting that only the less damaged side of the basal ganglia may have preserved capacity to process sensory feedback. These results also suggest the likelihood of sensory deficits in FOG that cannot be explained by cognitive mechanisms, since vibration effects were only observed unilaterally.",

The impacts of the predictors were assessed with meta-regression analyses, and significant predictors were used in a multivariable analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted in studies that enrolled PD patients with or without motor fluctuations.Forty-eight studies (consisting of 5618 participants on placebo) were included.

Influence of speech and other clinical parameters on worsening of the ACE-R and of the cognitive status was analyzed using linear and logistic regression.The cognitive status (classified as normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment and dementia) deteriorated in 25% of patients during the follow-up. The multivariate linear regression model consisted of the variation in range of the fundamental voice frequency (F0VR) and the REM Sleep Behavioral Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ). These parameters explained 37.2% of the variability of the change in ACE-R. The most significant predictors in the univariate logistic regression were the speech index of rhythmicity (SPIR; p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), disease duration (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019), and the RBDSQ (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032).

     "abstract": "Impulse control disorders and compulsive medication intake may occur in a minority of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms associated with addiction in the general population may increase the risk for addictive behaviors also in PD.Sixteen polymorphisms in candidate genes belonging to five neurotransmitter systems (dopaminergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic, opioidergic) and the BDNF were screened in 154 PD patients with addictive behaviors and 288 PD control subjects. Multivariate analysis investigated clinical and genetic predictors of outcome (remission vs. persistence/relapse) after 1 year and at the last follow-up (5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5 years).Addictive behaviors were associated with tryptophan hydroxylase type 2 (TPH2) and dopamine transporter gene variants. A subsequent analysis within the group of cases showed a robust association between TPH2 genotype and the severity of addictive behaviors, which survived Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. At multivariate analysis, TPH2 genotype resulted the strongest predictor of no remission at the last follow-up (OR[95%CI], 7.4[3.27\u201316.78] and 13.2[3.89\u201344.98] in heterozygous and homozygous carriers, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

TPH2 haplotype analysis confirmed the association with more severe symptoms and lower remission rates in the short- and the long-term (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005 for all analyses).The serotonergic system is likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of addictive behaviors in PD, modulating the severity of symptoms and the rate of remission at follow-up.

Co-occurrence of dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) and a PD phenotype has been reported in families with GCH1 mutations. Recently, rare coding variants in GCH1 were found to be enriched in PD patients, indicating a role for the enzyme in the neurodegenerative process.To further elucidate the contribution of GCH1 mutations to sporadic PD, we examined its coding exons in a targeted deep sequencing study of 509 PD patients (mean age at onset 56.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.0 years) and 230 controls. We further included the tyrosine hydroxylase gene TH, also known to cause DRD. Gene dose assessments were performed to screen for large copy number variants in a subset of 48 patients with early-onset PD.No putatively pathogenic GCH1 mutations were found. The frequency of rare heterozygous variants in the TH gene was 0.69% (7/1018) in the patient group and 0.22% (1/460) in the control group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.45).Previous studies have found that coding variants in the GCH1 gene may be considered a risk factor for PD. Our study indicates that mutations in GCH1 are rare in late-onset PD. Several patients carried heterozygous variants in the TH gene that may affect protein function. Our study was not designed to determine with certainty if any of these variants play a role as risk factors for late-onset PD.",

     "abstract": "DJ1 mutations (PARK7) are among the monogenic causes of early-onset autosomal recessive parkinsonism. Here, we report clinical and genetic findings in a family with Turkish origin carrying a new DJ1 mutation and presenting with early-onset levodopa responsive parkinsonism and signs of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).The family consisted of 12 members including 10 offsprings of whom three were affected. All family members underwent detailed clinical examination. DNA samples from the index case, his unaffected sister, and his parents were subjected to whole genome sequencing analysis.The index case 38-year-old man developed left hand tremor at the age of 24 years. He had progressive asymmetrical parkinsonism, depression and developed signs of ALS within 4 years. His two affected sisters had young-onset asymmetrical tremor-dominant parkinsonism with signs of ALS. A new homozygous p.Q45X mutation in exon 3 in DJ1 was found in all three patients. Their unaffected parents and one clinically healthy sibling were found to be heterozygous for this mutation.This is the second report of DJ1 mutations associated with parkinsonism and ALS. This is relevant for genetic counseling as well as for understanding the pathogenesis of the broad spectrum of parkinsonism-ALS disease complex.",

Further studies were sought by manually searching for secondary sources, including relevant journals and references in primary articles. The search was restricted to articles written in English between January 1980 and August 2015.Ten studies reported that alexithymia prevalence was about double in PD patients compared to control subjects and that specific dimensions of alexithymia might be related to depression, anxiety, apathy and impulsivity. Some studies investigated the relationship between alexithymia and neuropsychological symptoms and found correlations with frontal and parietal lobe functions. Two studies on neurological features reported a link between alexithymia and disease stage or a specific motor subtype of PD; the remaining studies found that alexithymia was independent from neurological symptoms, dopaminergic therapy and laterality of motor symptom onset.Data on neuroimaging correlates and therapeutic intervention on alexithymia in PD patients are still lacking.Although results suggest that alexithymia is a primary characteristics of PD, further studies with larger patient samples are needed to definitively clarify the impact of alexithymia on the clinical features of PD patients.",

In the design, implementation, and application of aDBS, the choice of the control variable and of the control algorithm represents the core challenge. The proposed approaches, in fact, differ in the choice of the control variable and control policy, in the system design and its technological limits, in the patient's target symptom, and in the surgical procedure needed. Here, we review the current proposals for aDBS systems, focusing on the choice of the control variable and its advantages and drawbacks, thus providing a general overview of the possible pathways for the clinical translation of aDBS with its benefits, limitations and unsolved issues.",

Here we used different paradigms of cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation to evaluate the Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical functioning in patients with normal scans.Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical circuit was investigated in 12 patients with normal scans, 8 patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD), 8 patients with adult-onset isolated dystonia and 9 healthy controls. We studied the effects of a single cerebellar magnetic pulse over the excitability of the contralateral primary motor cortex tested with Motor-Evoked-Potentials (Cerebellar-Inhibition) both at rest and during arm extension. Furthermore, we also tested the effects of cerebellar continuous-Theta-Burst-Stimulation on Motor-Evoked-Potentials amplitude.patients with normal scans compared to controls show a deficient Cerebellar-Inhibition at rest but not in arm extension; in both conditions they differ from PD but not from dystonic patients. Cerebellar Continuous-Theta-Burst-Stimulation induced the expected long-lasting cortical inhibition of Motor-Evoked-Potentials amplitude in patients with normal scans differently from PD and dystonic patients.patients with normal scans show a mild impairment in Cerebello-Thalamo-Cortical circuit that emerges only at rest. Such neurophysiological phenotype differs from the one observed in PD and dystonic patients, suggesting a distinct involvement of this pathway in the pathophysiology of these disorders.",

We measured echogenicity and determined presence of MRI signal changes in T2-weighted images in the substantia nigra (SN) and lentiform nucleus (NL). TCS with the capability of magnetic resonance fusion and Virtual Navigator was used. The echogenicity indices of SN and NL were processed using digital image analysis to eliminate subjective evaluation errors.Mean SN echogenicity index in EO-PD (39.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9 [SD]) was higher compared to WD (28.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and control subjects (28.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Mean NL echogenicity index was higher in WD (117.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a037.0) compared to EO-PD (61.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and control subjects (54.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The SN hyperechogenicity had sensitivity 93.8%, and specificity 90.9%, while the NL hyperechogenicity had sensitivity 95.5% and specificity 93.8% for differentiation of WD and EO-PD. NL hyperechogenicity was more pronounced in WD subjects with putaminal MRI T2 hyperintensity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but was also present in subjects without MRI abnormality.There are distinct TCS findings in WD and EO-PD complementary to MRI that can be utilized as highly sensitive and specific biomarkers of these disorders.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is neurodegenerative movement disorder affecting primarily the central nervous system with several recognized non-motor symptoms that can occur at various stages of the disease. Recently it has been shown that patients with PD may be prone to peripheral nervous system pathology in the form of a peripheral neuropathy (PN). It is unclear if PN is an inherent feature of PD or if it is an iatrogenic effect of the mainstay PD treatment Levodopa.To determine if peripheral neuropathy occurs in early untreated PD we employed a case-control study design using gold standard tests for PN, including neurological examination according to the Utah Early Neuropathy Scale (UENS) and nerve conduction studies, as well as new, more sensitive and informative tests for PN including the skin biopsy and corneal confocal microscopy (CCM).We studied 26 patients with PD and 22 controls using the neurological examination and nerve conduction studies (NCS) and found no significant difference between groups except for some reduced vibration sense in the PD group. Epidermal nerve densities in the skin biopsies were similar between our cohorts. However, using CCM \u2013 a more sensitive test and a surrogate marker of small fiber damage in PN, we found that patients with PD had significantly reduced corneal nerve fiber densities and lengths as compared to controls.We conclude that our positive CCM results provide evidence of preclinical PN in newly diagnosed PD patients.",

The respective dysphagia score covered three salient parameters, i. e. premature spillage, penetration/aspiration events and residues, each tested with liquid as well as semisolid and solid food consistencies. An improvement of >30% in this score indicated levodopa responsiveness of dysphagia. Measures were compared between the off- and on-state condition by using the Wilcoxon Test and marginal homogeneity test. Inter- and intrarater reliability was also investigated.Severity of swallowing dysfunction in the off state varied widely. The lowest dysphagia score was 15 points (dysphagia without any aspiration risk). The highest dysphagia score was 84 points (dysphagia with aspiration of all consistencies). Seven patients showed a marked improvement of dysphagia in the on state condition. Eight PD patients did not respond. Inter- and intrarater reliability was excellent for all three subscales in the off state and on state conditions.A significant proportion of advanced PD patients with motor fluctuations and mild to moderate oropharyngeal dysphagia may demonstrate a clinically relevant improvement of swallowing after levodopa challenge. The FEES-levodopa-test is a reliable and sensitive tool to differentiate these responders from non-responders.",

We assessed physical activity levels via self-report of (1) overall physical activity (PA) over 4 age periods; (2) competitive sports; and (3) occupational histories.PD risks were lower comparing the overall PA highest quartile (moderate to vigorous activities \u2265180 metabolic equivalent task-hours/week (MET-h/wk)) with the lowest quartile (<47.8\u00a0MET-h/wk) in age-period 18\u201324 years (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40\u20131.02), and 45\u201364 years (OR 0.50, 95%CI 0.31\u20130.83) but not in age-period 25\u201344.

Also, having participated in competitive sports prior to age 25 was inversely associated with PD (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.31\u20130.91 for high level versus never). There was no association for measures of occupational physical activity though.The long prodromal stage of PD makes it difficult to conclude whether insidious disease leads to a reduction of physical activity years before motor symptom onset and PD diagnosis. However, sports activities and high levels of overall PA in youth appear protective unless they are markers for biologic or genetic factors that lower PD risk.",

Moreover, correlations were found between the Purdue Pegboard and finger tapping ratings.Contactless 3D motion capture of finger tapping allowed an independent analysis of individual components of bradykinesia, demonstrating the amplitude decrement and maximum opening velocity as the most powerful discriminators between PD patients and controls.",

The reliability of three co-morbidity scales (the Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI), the Cumulative Illness Rating scale and a simple disease count) were evaluated. The association with mortality and development of dependency was assessed with Cox regression. The co-morbidity burden in PD and controls was compared at baseline and over 5 years of follow-up using linear mixed modelling.The CCI was more reliable and was an independent predictor of mortality with a time-dependent effect (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.27 [1.08\u20131.49] in first four years of follow-up; no significant association after four years). Associations between the other scales and mortality and between each scale and development of dependency were non-significant once adjusted for confounders. Co-morbidity burden was similar between cases and controls at baseline and there was no evidence of differential accrual of co-morbidity between patients and controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.94).The CCI is probably the better scale for measuring co-morbidity burden in PD.

While it is recognized that motor, cognitive and affective neuropsychiatric symptoms negatively influence the patients\u2019 quality of life, it is currently unknown how these symptoms contribute to phenotypic subtypes. The objective of this study was to assess subtypes of motor, cognitive and affective symptoms in PD.A hierarchical cluster analysis was conducted on clinical data of 226 PD patients screened at the VU University Medical Center using comprehensive assessment of cognitive, affective and motor symptoms. Subsequent linear discriminant analyses were conducted to investigate discriminating constructs between clusters.The cluster analysis yielded four clusters: (1) a young-age (59.9 years), mildly affected cluster (N\u00a0=\u00a086), (2) an old-age (72.3 years) cluster with severe motor and non-motor symptoms (N\u00a0=\u00a015), (3) a cluster (age 64.7 years) with mild motor symptoms, below-average executive functioning and affective symptoms (N\u00a0=\u00a046) and (4) a cluster (age 64.8 years) with severe motor symptoms, affective symptoms and below-average verbal memory (N\u00a0=\u00a079).Cluster 1 and 2 seem to represent opposite ends of the PD disease stages. Patients in clusters 3 and 4 had similar age, educational level and disease duration but different symptom profiles \u2013 we therefore suggest that these clusters represent different pathways of disease progression, presumably with distinct underlying pathology localization. Future research on the neuropathophysiological characteristics of these two clusters and monitoring of disease progression is required.",

While some motor clusters have been consistently identified, little is known about non-motor PD subtypes and motor-non-motor interplay. Research in this regard has produced somewhat contradictory results, which might be biased by the inclusion of treated patients.We performed a non-hierarchical cluster analysis using both motor and non-motor data on 398 newly diagnosed untreated PD patients enrolled in the Parkinson's Progressive Marker Initiative (PPMI) study. We further evaluated whether dopaminergic dysfunction, as measured by 123[I]-FP-CIT SPECT scan, could explain, at least partially, the observed difference between the clusters.Three clusters were identified. Group 1 was characterized by the lowest motor and non-motor burden, whereas group 2 and 3 had similar motor disability, but different non-motor involvement, especially with regards to apathy and hallucinations. 123[I]-FP-CIT binding values paralleled motor disability burden among the 3 clusters, but further multivariate analyses also revealed a negative correlation with depression.Our results confirm the motor as well as non-motor heterogeneity of PD, suggesting the existence of 3 different subtypes. Dopaminergic dysfunction only marginally explains the non-motor variability of PD.

The primary neuropathology is the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, resulting in characteristic motor deficits, upon which the clinical diagnosis is based. However, a number of significant non-motor symptoms (NMS) are also evident that appear to have a greater impact on the quality of life of these patients.In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that neurobiological processes can be modified by the bi-directional communication that occurs along the brain-gut axis. The microbiota plays a key role in this communication throughout different routes in both physiological and pathological conditions. Thus, there has been an increasing interest in investigating how microbiota changes within the gastrointestinal tract may be implicated in health and disease including PD.Interestingly \u03b1-synuclein-aggregates, the cardinal neuropathological feature in PD, are present in both the submucosal and myenteric plexuses of the enteric nervous system, prior to their appearance in the brain, indicating a possible gut to brain route of \u201cprion-like\u201d spread.

The genesis of VH is related to impaired bottom-up and/or top-down visual processing which can be linked to cholinergic dysfunction and mono-amine imbalance. The risk of developing VH with oral dopamine agonists seems to increase with advancing disease, while in contrast some clinical studies suggest that apomorphine does not worsen VH, or might even improve VH.The aim of this study is to review the current evidence of apomorphine and its effects on VH in PD patients.Apomorphine is well-tolerated in PD patients with VH, also in long-term follow-up studies. Apomorphine is also suggested to have the potential to alleviate VH. Some data suggest that the positive effect of apomorphine on VH is related to its piperidine moiety, part of many anti-psychotics. Irrespective this piperidine moiety, apomorphine has a high D1\u2013like receptor affinity, and acts as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, which might explain the potential anti-hallucinogenic properties as well.The anecdotal evidence suggesting that apomorphine has a relatively low proclivity to induce VH in PD may be due to its capacity to reduce serotonergic activity in particular. Therefore apomorphine is still an option to consider in fluctuating PD patients with VH, if they are treated properly with respect to their cholinergic deficits and existing VH.",

After correcting for GMV, HD patients demonstrated significantly decreased ALFF in the right precuneus and angular gyrus, and increased ALFF in bilateral inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and left superior frontal gyrus. Increased mean values of ALFF in the left ITG were correlated with worse performance in SDMT, and decreased mean values of ALFF in the precuneus were correlated with worse performance in the Stroop test and SDMT.Our results suggest that intrinsic brain activity alterations in the precuneus and cortico-striatal circuit may be the mechanism underlying impaired cognition in early HD.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is associated with poorer quality of life (QoL). Prior to the onset of PDD, many patients experience progressive cognitive impairment. There is a paucity of longitudinal studies investigating the effects of cognitive decline on QoL. This study aimed to determine the longitudinal impact of cognitive change on QoL in an incident PD cohort.Recently diagnosed patients with PD (n\u00a0=\u00a0212) completed a schedule of neuropsychological assessments and QoL measures; these were repeated after 18 (n\u00a0=\u00a0190) and 36 months (n\u00a0=\u00a0158). Mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) was classified with reference to the Movement Disorder Society criteria. Principal component analysis was used to reduce 10 neuropsychological tests to three cognitive factors: attention, memory/executive function, and global cognition.Baseline PD-MCI was a significant contributor to QoL (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). For those subjects (9%) who developed dementia, cognitive function had a much greater impact on QoL (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a010.3, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Multivariate modelling showed attentional deficits had the strongest predictive power (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.3, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01); brief global tests only modestly predicted decline in QoL (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.4, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).PD-MCI was associated with poorer QoL over three years follow up. Cognitive impairment had a greater impact on QoL in individuals who developed dementia over follow-up. Impaired attention was a significant determinant of QoL in PD. Interventions which improve concentration and attention in those with PD could potentially improve QoL.",

Significantly fewer PD-MCI participants developed dementia over one year. Compared to AD-MCI participants, PD-MCI participants performed better at baseline and over time on a global measure of cognition (Mini Mental State Exam), memory measures (immediate and delayed Logical Memory), and a language measure (Boston Naming Test), and additionally performed better over time on an attention measure (Digit Span Forward), a language measure (Vegetable List), a processing speed measure (Digit Symbol), and an overall measure of memory and functional impairment (CDR-SB).Our study provides further evidence that PD-MCI is clinically distinct from AD-MCI and requires different tools for diagnosis and monitoring clinical progression. More importantly, this study suggests that PD-MCI takes longer to convert into dementia than AD-MCI, findings that require replication by other studies.",

Converging evidences show that neurodegeneration of the cerebellum underlies the pathophysiology of ET, but it is not known if cerebellar changes also occurs in patients with rET. The aim of our study was to evaluate cerebellar microstructure in patients with ET with- (rET) and without resting tremor (ETwr) in comparison to healthy controls by MR Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI).We studied 67 patients with ET (rET: 29 and ETwr: 38) and 39 age-matched healthy controls (HC). DTI was performed to measure fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of white and grey matter (WM, GM) in the entire cerebellum and in right and left cerebellar hemispheres.MD was significantly higher in the cerebellar GM of ET total group (10.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.87) in comparison with HC (9.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0027).

No differences among groups were found in MD of cerebellar WM and in FA values neither in the WM nor in the GM.Our results demonstrate the presence of microstructural changes in the cerebellum of patients with ET. It is noteworthy that rET showed intermediate values compared to HC and ETwr, suggesting that rET shares part of the pathophysiological mechanisms of ETwr, but cerebellar involvement seems do not fully account for rET.

Impaired energy metabolism is considered a pathogenic mechanism in PD and mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from Zn2+ dyshomeostasis has been found in KRS patient-derived cells. In addition to mitochondrial energy production, glycolysis plays an important role in cellular energy metabolism and glucose hypometabolism has been reported in PD. However, glycolytic status in KRS remains undetermined despite its potential importance.We assessed glycolytic function in ATP13A2-deficient KRS patient-derived human olfactory neurosphere cells and fibroblasts and determined the effect of pyruvate supplementation on improving cellular energy production.We found impaired extracellular acidification, reduction in pyruvate production and a decrease in the NAD+/NADH ratio, indicative of glycolytic dysfunction. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed an altered expression profile for several glycolytic enzymes. Glycolytic dysfunction was aggravated when the intracellular Zn2+ concentration was increased, while ATP13A2 overexpression and pyruvate supplementation blocked the observed Zn2+-mediated toxicity. Moreover, supplementation with pyruvate significantly increased basal mitochondrial ATP production and abolished Zn2+-induced cell death.These findings indicate that glycolytic dysfunction contributes to pathogenesis and pyruvate supplementation improves overall cellular bioenergetics in our KRS patient-derived cell model, highlighting a therapeutic potential.",

The findings were compared to all 21 previously reported cases of runner's dystonia.We identified 20 patients with this condition, 13 runners and seven non-runner athletes. Median age at dystonia onset was in mid-adulthood. Correct diagnosis was delayed by a median of 3.5 years in runners and 1.6 years in non-runners, by which time more than one-third of patients had undergone unsuccessful invasive procedures. Most patients had dystonia onset in the distal lower limb. Dystonia was task-specific with exercise at onset but progressed to affect walking in most. Sensory tricks were reported in some. Surface EMG was consistent with task-specific dystonia in nine patients. Botulinum toxin, levodopa, clonazepam, trihexyphenidyl, and physical therapy provided modest benefit to some, but all patients remained substantially symptomatic at last follow up.Repetitive exercise dystonia is task-specific, confined to the lower limb and occasionally trunk musculature. It tends to be treatment-refractory and limits ability to exercise. Diagnosis is typically delayed, and unnecessary surgical procedures are common. Surface EMG may aid the diagnosis.",

Prospective studies suggest that higher motor scores and levodopa dosage, younger age at onset and female gender represent risk factors for motor fluctuations' development. Yet, the predictors of development of non motor fluctuations (NMF) are less clear.In this prospective study, we aimed to assess the relationship between NMF and gender along with other potential risk factors.Forty-seven (16 women/31 men) de novo, drug-na\u00efve PD patients have been followed for 4 years since diagnosis. Motor and non motor fluctuations were evaluated with the 19-item Wearing off Questionnaire (WOQ-19). The association between gender and NMF was explored with multivariable regression models adjusted for age at onset, motor and non motor symptoms at diagnosis and levodopa intake at follow up.Female gender was more likely associated with a diagnosis of NMF (adjusted odds ratio, AOR\u00a0=\u00a05.33,95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.21\u201323.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027), but not with a diagnosis of generic wearing off at follow up (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.66, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.8\u201316.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.097).

However, it has often been observed as part of the clinical picture of additional neurodegenerative disorders, sometimes antedating the motor signs, or following focal basal ganglia lesions without any accompanying parkinsonism, suggesting that bradykinesia and rigidity are not sine-qua-non for the development of this phenomenon. Therefore, micrographia in a patient with no signs of parkinsonism may prompt the clinician to perform imaging in order to exclude a focal basal ganglia lesion.Dopaminergic etiology in this and other cases is doubtful, since levodopa ameliorates letter stroke size only partially, and only in some patients. Parkinsonian handwriting is often characterized by lack of fluency, slowness, and less frequently by micrographia. Deviations from kinematic laws of motion that govern normal movement, including the lack of movement smoothness and inability to scale movement amplitude to the desired size, may reflect impairments in motion planning, possible loss of automaticity and reduced movement vigor.The etiology, neuroanatomy, mechanisms and models of micrographia are discussed. Dysfunction of the basal ganglia circuitry induced by neurodegeneration or disruption by focal damage give rise to micrographia.",

Its origin likely emerges from basal ganglia dysfunction, leading to an impaired control of inhibitory intracortical motor circuits. Some neurorehabilitation approaches include movement imitation training; besides the effects of motor practice, there might be a benefit due to observation and imitation of un-altered movement patterns. In this sense, virtual reality facilitates the process by customizing motor-patterns to be observed and imitated.To evaluate the effect of a motor-imitation therapy focused on hypometria in Parkinson's disease using virtual reality.We carried out a randomized controlled pilot-study. Sixteen patients were randomly assigned in experimental and control groups. Groups underwent 4-weeks of training based on finger-tapping with the dominant hand, in which imitation was the differential factor (only the experimental group imitated). We evaluated self-paced movement features and cortico-spinal excitability (recruitment curves and silent periods in both hemispheres) before, immediately after, and two weeks after the training period.Movement amplitude increased significantly after the therapy in the experimental group for the trained and un-trained hands. Motor thresholds and silent periods evaluated with transcranial magnetic stimulation were differently modified by training in the two groups; although the changes in the input\u2013output recruitment were similar.This pilot study suggests that movement imitation therapy enhances the effect of motor practice in patients with Parkinson's disease; imitation-training might be helpful for reducing hypometria in these patients.

Patients were stratified into 2 groups based on the modified Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) disability score: early stage, H&Y\u00a0\u2264\u00a02.0 and moderate stage, H&Y\u00a0\u2265\u00a02.5. All participants completed the activities-specific balance confidence (ABC) scale and performed standing balance and gait initiation tasks to assess static and dynamic balance control. The center of pressure (COP) sway (CE95%Sway) during static balance and the peak distance between the projections of the COP and the center of mass (COM) in the transverse plane (COPCOM) during gait initiation were calculated. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted relating the ABC score and CE95%Sway and COPCOM.For early stage PD, there was a moderate correlation between ABC score and CE95%Sway (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.56, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.32, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), while no significant correlation was found between ABC score and COPCOM (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.24, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.06, p\u00a0=\u00a00.227). For moderate stage PD, there was a moderate correlation between ABC score and COPCOM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.49, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.044), while no correlation was found between ABC score and CE95%Sway (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.19, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.04, p\u00a0=\u00a00.478).Individuals with different disease severities showed different relationships between balance confidence and actual static/dynamic balance control.",

MPS was evaluated via Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III. Brain MRI was used to determine SVD (cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], lacunar infarctions [LIs], and white matter hyperintensities [WMH]). The presence of each SVD feature was indicated by the total SVD score. Logistic regression analyses were performed adjusting for age, sex, history of stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia.In a multivariate analysis, we found that the presence of CMBs, deep CMBs, mixed (in the basal ganglia and thalamus) LIs, periventricular hyperintensities (PVH), and deep WMH (DWMH), and total SVD score were significantly associated with MPS, whereas strictly lobar CMBs and other LIs (in strictly basal ganglia or strictly thalamus) were not. We also found a significant association between mixed LIs, PVH, DWMH and total SVD score and gait/balance function, between PVH and rigidity, and between mixed LIs and bradykinesia. Among elderly participants (\u226573years), the association of total SVD score, deep CMBs, mixed LIs, and PVH, with MPS remained significant.Our results provide additional evidence that SVD including CMBs, and especially total SVD burden, might be a surrogate marker for MPS and support the contribution of hypertensive microangiopathy as the underlying etiology.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of STN-DBS on gastric motility using electrogastrography (EGG).Twenty patients with PD (5 females, 15 males; mean aged 58.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.0 years) who underwent STN-DBS were studied. EGG was performed in fasting and postprandial conditions before STN-DBS and 3 months after the surgery. We also evaluated the frequency and severity of gastrointestinal symptoms based on a structured gastrointestinal dysfunction questionnaire.After STN-DBS the percentage of normogastria (47.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020.7 vs 51.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.1) and period dominant power (PDP) (11.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 vs 12.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9) significantly increased, the percentage of arrhythmia decreased compared to the baseline during fasting and postprandial state. Abnormal response to a meal (power ratio of PDP <1 after meal) decreased from 70% to 55% after 3 months follow-up. The abnormal EGG (the percentage of normogastria <70%) decreased in both fasting (from 80% to 65% patients) and postprandial state (from 80% to 60% patients), respectively after the surgery. The most common GI symptoms reported prior to the surgery were constipation 95%, difficulty with defecation 85% and dysphagia 50%. After STN-DBS all gastrointestinal symptoms improved, the greatest improvement was observed in difficulty with defecation.Our results suggest that STN-DBS improves gastric motility as well as gastrointestinal symptoms in PD.

Although promising compounds have been developed to treat these symptoms, clinical trials have failed. This failure may, at least partly, be explained by the lack of objective and continuous assessment strategies. This study tested the clinical validity and ecological effect of an algorithm that detects and quantifies dyskinesias of the legs using a single ankle-worn sensor.Twenty-three PD patients (seven with leg dyskinesias) and 13 control subjects were investigated in the lab. Participants performed purposeful daily activity-like tasks while being video-taped. Clinical evaluation was performed using the leg dyskinesia item of the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale. The ecological effect of the developed algorithm was investigated in a multi-center, 12-week, home-based sub-study that included three patients with and seven without dyskinesias.In the lab-based sub-study, the sensor-based algorithm exhibited a specificity of 98%, a sensitivity of 85%, and an accuracy of 0.96 for the detection of dyskinesias and a correlation level of 0.61 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) with the clinical severity score. In the home-based sub-study, all patients could be correctly classified regarding the presence or absence of leg dyskinesias, supporting the ecological relevance of the algorithm.This study provides evidence of clinical validity and ecological effect of an algorithm derived from a single sensor on the ankle for detecting leg dyskinesias in PD patients. These results should motivate the investigation of leg dyskinesias in larger studies using wearable sensors.",

Two blinded readers independently assessed the images. We carried out a comparative analysis of five patients with hemiparkinsonism via 123I-2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-nortropane (123I-FP-CIT) SPECT.7T MRI revealed a definitive shape of nigral hyperintensity in healthy subjects, nearly identical to neuropathological characterization of nigrosome 1, and enabled instantaneous determination of its presence or absence in all subjects. Nigral hyperintensity was lost in all patients with PD, MSA with predominant parkinsonism, and PSP. One of five patients with MSA with predominant cerebellar ataxia showed an intact nigral hyperintensity. The side effects were mild and tolerable, and imaging was successful in patients with dyskinesia. Motion artifact incidence was higher in elderly subjects. In hemiparkinsonism cases, we observed partial loss of nigral hyperintensity on the side of less reduced 123I-FP-CIT binding, suggesting an ongoing iron deposition on the unaffected side in hemiparkinsonism.The present findings suggest that 7T MRI represents an excellent tool for evaluating nigral hyperintensity in PD, MSA, and PSP, with tolerable side effects and limited motion artifacts. Thus, imaging of parkinsonism may benefit from using 7T MRI.",

In Drosophila and rat models of polyQ diseases, histone deacetylation (HDAC) inhibitors improved locomotor function and survival time by increasing histone acetylation levels and modulating gene expression. Valproic acid (VPA) is a pan-HDAC inhibitor used clinically to treat bipolar and seizure disorders. We evaluated the clinical safety and efficacy of VPA treatment for SCA3/MJD patients.First, a randomized, open-label, dose-escalation method was used to evaluate tolerance to single-dose VPA administration in 12 SCA3/MJD patients. Patients were randomly assigned to three groups of four subjects, each with an oral dosage of 400\u00a0mg, 600\u00a0mg, or 800\u00a0mg (twice daily (bid) for one day). VPA was well-tolerated for one-dose by all patient groups. Second, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-controlled study evaluated the safety and efficacy of multi-dose VPA (oral administration, twice daily (bid) for 12 weeks) in 36 SCA3/MJD patients. Patients received either low-dose VPA (800\u00a0mg/day), high-dose VPA (1200\u00a0mg/day), or placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a012 subjects per group). Symptoms were evaluated using the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA).Multi-dose VPA treatment improved SARA measures of locomotor function. Major adverse effects included dizziness and loss of appetite.VPA is a potentially beneficial agent for the treatment of SCA3/MJD. These results also provide insight into possible future therapeutics for polyQ diseases.",

In all patients, we measured the components of HRV in the frequency domain during 24-h with daytime and night time recordings. Selected variables considered were low-frequency (LF) influenced by the sympathetic system and high-frequency (HF) influenced by the parasympathetic system. Moreover, we calculated night-to-day ratio for both LF (cardiac sympathetic index) and HF (cardiac parasympathetic index) spectral components. Video-polysomnography was performed in all patients to diagnose RBD.Both nocturnal LF and HF spectral power values were significantly higher in PD-RBD patients than in PD patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.004 respectively). Moreover, in PD-RBD patients LF and HF values were higher at night than during the day while no difference between night time and daytime values was observed in patients with PD. Cardiac sympathetic index value was significantly higher in PD-RBD patients (median 1.83, range 1.65\u20133.66) than in PD patients (median 0.93, range 0.44\u20131.3) without overlap of individual values between groups (accuracy 100%). By contrast, cardiac parasympathetic index had sensitivity of 45% and specificity of 100% for differentiating between PD groups.Cardiac sympathetic index distinguishes PD-RBD patients from those with PD on an individual basis, thus representing a valid help in everyday clinical practice for screening of RBD in PD patients.",

We investigated the relationship between dementia and gender along with other established risk factors, such as age and disease duration.We conducted a cross-sectional retrospective study including all consecutive patients diagnosed with idiopathic PD attending a single out-patient tertiary clinic over an 18-year period (1995\u20132013). Dementia was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria.Prevalence of dementia was 11.5% (95%CI, 10.8\u201312.3) and 13.5% (95%CI, 12.7\u201314.5) in the whole population (N\u00a0=\u00a06599) and in those aged \u226560 years (N\u00a0=\u00a05373), respectively. Age and disease duration were independently associated with dementia, and the latter was associated with dementia up to 84 years of age. Male gender was an independent risk factor. In addition, while the rate of dementia increased in males over all age strata, we found that in females prevalence began to increase steadily after the age of 65 years, reaching male estimates only after 80 years of age. Higher rates in male gender were observed between 60 and 80 years of age.Age and PD duration are confirmed risk factors for dementia. However, disease duration appeared to be a less important factor in cognitive decline in patients aged \u226585 years. As opposed to gender-specific estimates in the general population, male gender is likely associated with higher rates of dementia in PD patients.",

However, types of dual-tasking deficits preceding falls in PD are still unclear.Walking velocities during box-checking and subtracting serial 7s were assessed twice a year in 40 PD patients over 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0 years. Fourteen patients reported a fall within this period (4 excluded fallers already reported falls at baseline). Their dual-task costs (DTC; mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation) 4.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2 months before the first fall were compared with 22 patients never reporting falls. ROC analyses and logistic regressions accounting for DTC, UPDRS-III and disease duration were used for faller classification and prediction.Only walking/box-checking predicted fallers. Fallers showed higher DTC for walking while box-checking, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029, but not for box-checking while walking, p\u00a0=\u00a00.178 (combined motor DTC, p\u00a0=\u00a00.022), than non-fallers. Combined motor DTC classified fallers and non-fallers (area under curve: 0.75; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.60\u20130.91) with 71.4% sensitivity (95%CI: 41.9%\u201391.6%) and 77.3% specificity (54.6%\u201392.2%), and significantly predicted future fallers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023). Here, 20.4%-points higher combined motor DTC (i.e. the mean difference between fallers and non-fallers) was associated with a 2.6 (1.1\u20136.0) times higher odds to be a future faller.Motor dual-tasking is a potentially valuable predictor of falls in PD, suggesting that avoiding dual task situations as well as specific motor dual-task training might help to prevent falls in PD. These findings and their therapeutic relevance need to be further validated in PD patients without fall history, in early PD stages, and with various motor-motor dual-task challenges.",

     "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation represents a major advance in the treatment of several types of movement disorders. However, during stimulation new movement disorders may emerge, thus limiting the positive effects of this therapy. These movement disorders may be induced by: 1) stimulation of the targeted nucleus, 2) stimulation of surrounding tracts and nuclei, and 3) as a result of dose adjustment of accompanying medications, such as reduction of dopaminergic drugs in patients with Parkinson's disease. Various dyskinesias, blepharospasm, and apraxia of eyelid opening have been described mainly with subthalamic nucleus stimulation, whereas hypokinesia and freezing of gait have been observed with stimulation of the globus pallidus internus. Other deep brain stimulation-related movement disorders include dyskinesias associated with stimulation of the globus pallidus externus and ataxic gait as a side effect of chronic bilateral stimulation of the ventral intermediate nucleus of thalamus. These movement disorders are generally reversible and usually resolved once the stimulation is reduced or turned off. This, however, typically leads to loss of benefit of the underlying movement disorder which can be re-gained by using different contacts, changing targets or stimulation parameters, and adjusting pharmacological therapy. New and innovative emerging technologies and stimulation techniques may help to prevent or overcome the various deep brain stimulation-induced movement disorders. In this review we aim to describe the clinical features, frequency, pathophysiology, and strategies for treatment of these iatrogenic movement disorders.",

The present article evaluates the prevalence and characteristics of hypersexuality in the context of PD, focusing on the best available evidence.We conducted a systematic literature review according to the Prisma guidelines on large-scale epidemiological studies (n\u00a0>\u00a0250) assessing hypersexuality in patients with PD treated with DRT.Our systematic literature review identified 10 relevant studies characterised by medium\u2013to-large sample sizes (n\u00a0=\u00a0268-3090). Average lifetime prevalence of hypersexuality in patients with PD on DRT was found to be 2.7% (7.4% in patients on dopamine agonists). In general, hypersexuality was associated with male gender and higher doses of dopamine agonists. Other clinically relevant associations included younger age, earlier PD onset and history of behavioural symptoms prior to dopamine agonist use.Hypersexuality is not rare in patients with PD treated with DRT, particularly in those on dopamine agonists. These findings indicate that PD specialists should regularly screen and monitor for hypersexuality, paying particular attention to younger male patients, with an early PD onset and previous history of behavioural problems.",

IHI in both hemispheres was measured using transcranial magnetic stimulation.A stepwise regression analysis revealed musical activity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and a family history of dystonia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) but not dystonia per se, age, handedness or gender as relevant factors modulating IHI.These data support the notion of a genetic background of musician's hand dystonia and suggests that reduced IHI is a possible endophenotypic marker of this disorder.",

The aim of this study was to develop a valid and reliable rating scale of predominantly non-dopaminergic (PND) symptoms, which can be used as an additional measure of severity and progression of PD.Using data of the PROPARK (N\u00a0=\u00a0396) and ELEP (N\u00a0=\u00a0365) cohorts, three items were selected from each of six selected PND domains (cognitive impairment, depressive symptoms, excessive daytime sleepiness, psychotic symptoms, autonomic dysfunction and Postural-Instability-and-Gait-Difficulty), based on item\u2013total correlations. Hereafter, we evaluated reliability and validity of the resulting scale.The 18-item PND scale showed to be reliable and valid. Cronbach's alpha was 0.83. Principal component analysis using the six domain scores resulted in one factor, justifying the calculation of a sum score. Correlation coefficients of the sum score with severity of non-motor symptoms (non-motor part of MDS\u2013UPDRS), motor symptoms (SPES/SCOPA scale), and Hoehn and Yahr stage were 0.63, 0.41 and 0.48, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).We developed a short, reliable and valid scale to evaluate severity of PND symptoms in PD. The score is expected to be largely insensitive to dopaminergic effects and may therefore more accurately reflect severity and progression of the underlying disease than currently used dopamine-sensitive measures. In combination with assessment of predominantly dopaminergic (motor) symptoms, a broad yet concise evaluation of PD is obtained, which better captures the widespread clinical consequences of the multisystem disease.",

Serial assessments included measures of motor symptoms, NMS, neuropsychological assessment, and CSF biomarkers. Up to three years follow-up data were included.At baseline, worse olfaction (lowest tertile) was associated with more severe NMS, including anxiety and autonomic symptoms. Those in the lowest olfactory tertile were more likely to report cognitive impairment (37.4%) compared to those in the middle (24.4%) and highest olfactory tertiles (14.2%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A\u03b21-42 was significantly lower, and tau/A\u03b21-42 ratio was higher in those with worse olfaction. In longitudinal analyses, lower UPSIT score was associated with greater decline in MoCA score (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.02 [0.01, 0.03], p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) over time, as were composite measures of UPSIT score and either A\u03b21-42 or tau/A\u03b21-42 ratio. In a Cox proportional hazards model, a composite measure of olfaction and A\u03b21-42 was a significant predictor of conversion from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI; i.e., MoCA\u00a0<\u00a026), with subjects most impaired on both measures being 87% more likely to develop incident MCI (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.87 [1.16, 3.01], p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).Worse baseline olfaction is associated with long-term cognitive decline.

Whereas most studies have focused on cognitive and neuroimaging markers of disease progression, little is known about the prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in premanifest mutation carriers far-from and close-to disease onset.We obtained neurological, cognitive and behavioral data from 230 participants classified as premanifest far-from (preHD-A) and close-to (preHD-B) motor-based disease onset, early-symptomatic (early-HD), and healthy controls. Frequency and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed with the short Problem Behaviors Assessment for HD (PBA-s). The odds-ratio (OR) to present symptoms in the clinical range was calculated using the control group as reference. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore relationships between neuropsychiatric symptoms and medication use.Prevalence of depression was similar in all groups. Apathy was already present in 32% of preHD-A increasing to 62% of early-HD patients. The probability of presenting apathetic symptoms was 15\u201388 times higher in preHD-A and preHD-B respectively than in healthy controls. Irritability and executive dysfunction were present in both preHD-B and early-HD.Neuropsychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent in HD, already in the premanifest stage, with increasing prevalence of irritability, apathy and executive dysfunction closer to onset. Compared to controls, HD mutation carriers have the highest probability to develop apathy, with an increasing prevalence along disease stages. Our findings confirm the high prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in HD, already many years before the onset of motor symptoms, with apathy as an early manifestation and core neuropsychiatric feature of the disease.",

Our objective was to describe the natural, multidimensional trajectory of disability in persons with PD over a two-year period.We conducted a multi-center, prospective cohort study involving four institutions. Data were collected at baseline and at 6-month intervals over 2 years using standardized clinical tests representing three World Health Organization defined disability domains: impairment, activity limitation, and participation restriction. Unadjusted mixed effects growth models characterized trajectories of disability in the three disability domains. The data set was analyzed using restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation. Standardized estimates of change were also computed using Cohen's d for each measure.Of the 266 enrolled participants, we analysed data from individuals who participated in at least 3 assessments (n\u00a0=\u00a0207, 79%). Rates of disability progression over the 2-year period differed across domains. Moderate effects were detected for motor impairment (d\u00a0=\u00a0.28) and walking-related activity limitation (gait-related balance (d\u00a0=\u00a0.31); gait speed (d\u00a0=\u00a0.30)). Marginal effects were noted for upper extremity-related activity limitation (d\u00a0=\u00a0.11) and health-related quality of life participation restriction (d\u00a0=\u00a0.08).The natural trajectory of walking-related activity limitation was the most potent indicator of evolving disability, suggesting that routine assessment of walking and periodic rehabilitation is likely to be warranted for many persons with PD. Natural trajectories of disability provide important comparison data for future intervention studies.",

Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed for posturographic parameters and possible confounders to determine postural sensory contributors to FOG. We also correlated FOG severity, measured using a New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, with posturographic parameters.PD patients with FOG showed worse postural sensory processing compared with those without FOG. In particular, the inability to use the vestibular information (odds ratio [OR] 1.447; 95% confidential interval [CI]: 1.120, 1.869) and poor control over the perturbed somatosensory inputs (OR 2.904; 95% CI: 1.028, 8.202) significantly contributed to FOG.

This study evaluated patterns of cortical morphology, basal ganglia, and white matter microstructural alterations in patients with spasmodic dysphonia relative to healthy controls.T1-weighted and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained from 13 spasmodic dysphonia patients and 30 controls. Tract-based spatial statistics was applied to compare diffusion tensor MRI indices (i.e., mean, radial and axial diffusivities, and fractional anisotropy) between groups on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Cortical measures were analyzed using surface-based morphometry. Basal ganglia were segmented on T1-weighted images, and volumes and diffusion tensor MRI metrics of nuclei were measured.Relative to controls, patients with spasmodic dysphonia showed increased cortical surface area of the primary somatosensory cortex bilaterally in a region consistent with the buccal sensory representation, as well as right primary motor cortex, left superior temporal, supramarginal and superior frontal gyri. A decreased cortical area was found in the rolandic operculum bilaterally, left superior/inferior parietal and lingual gyri, as well as in the right angular gyrus. Compared to controls, spasmodic dysphonia patients showed increased diffusivities and decreased fractional anisotropy of the corpus callosum and major white matter tracts, in the right hemisphere. Altered diffusion tensor MRI measures were found in the right caudate and putamen nuclei with no volumetric changes.Multi-level alterations in voice-controlling networks, that included regions devoted not only to sensorimotor integration, motor preparation and motor execution, but also processing of auditory and visual information during speech, might have a role in the pathophysiology of spasmodic dysphonia.",

Probable PDD was diagnosed according to the Movement Disorder Society Task Force clinical criteria. Using binary logistic regression, we selected significant items from an original 30-item informant questionnaire.

Three imagined walking tasks, i.e., usual walking, obstacle negotiation, and navigation were performed. Watching the same virtual scenes without imagining walking served as control tasks. Whole brain analyses were used.Compared to usual walking, both groups had increased activation during obstacle negotiation in middle occipital gyrus (MOG) (pFWEcorr<0.001), middle frontal gyrus (MFG) (pFWEcorr<0.005), and cerebellum (pFWEcorr<0.001). Healthy older adults had higher activation in precuneus and MOG (pFWEcorr<0.023) during navigation, while no differences were observed in patients with PD. Between group comparisons revealed that patients with PD had a significantly higher activation in usual walking and obstacle negotiation (pFWEcorr<0.039) while during navigation task, healthy older adults had higher activation (pFWEcorr<0.047).Patients with PD require greater activation during imagined usual walking and obstacle negotiation than healthy older adults. This increased activation may reflect a compensatory attempt to overcome inefficient neural activation in patients with PD. This increased activation may reduce the functional reserve needed during more demanding tasks such as during navigation which may contribute to the high prevalence of falls and dual tasking difficulties among patients with PD.",

     "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is highly prevalent and has a severe negative effect on health related and perceived quality of life in Parkinson's disease (PD). It is now established that 20\u201340% of persons with PD will develop cognitive deficits early in the disease. Moreover, the risk of developing dementia is six times higher in PD patients than in age-matched controls and it is estimated that 80% of patients will develop dementia after 20 years of the disease. In order to address these symptoms properly it is crucial to identify very early in the disease the patients who are most likely to develop dementia rapidly. Persons who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) exhibit measurable cognitive deficits but those deficits are not severe enough to interfere significantly with daily life. While the presence of MCI in PD increases the chance of developing dementia, various studies suggest that PD-MCI might consist of distinct subtypes with different pathophysiologies and prognoses. In this paper we comment on various biomarkers associated with cognitive decline in PD, specifically clinical, neuropathological, genetic and neuroimaging ones. We also discuss disrupted functional connectivity in PD-MCI and reveal preliminary results from our own group. We propose that the current studies looking at different types of biomarkers provide support for different causes being associated with cognitive decline in PD. Large-scale multi-disciplinary and multi-modal longitudinal studies are required to identify more specifically the different phenotypes associated with different cognitive profiles and evolution in PD.",

We here describe the rare association of dystonia with anarthria/aphonia, by examining a large cohort of patients, to provide a narrow field of underlying conditions and a practical algorithmic approach to reach diagnosis.We retrospectively reviewed cases, which were evaluated between 2005 and 2014, to identify those with dystonia combined with marked anarthria and/or aphonia. We reviewed demographic information, clinical characteristics, as well as clinico-genetic investigations. We evaluated video material where available.From 860 cases with dystonia as the predominant motor feature, we identified 32 cases (3.7%) with anarthria/aphonia. Age at neurological symptom onset was variable, but the majority of cases (n\u00a0=\u00a020) developed symptoms within their first eight years of life. A conclusive diagnosis was reached in 27 cases. Monoamine neurotransmitter disorders, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation syndromes, hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, and syndromes with inborn errors of metabolism were the most common diagnoses. Brain MRI was crucial for reaching a diagnosis by examining the structural integrity of the basal ganglia, the cerebral cortex, brain myelination and whether there was abnormal metal deposition. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying anarthria/aphonia included dystonia, corticobulbar involvement, apraxia and abnormalities of brain development.The spectrum of conditions that may present with the syndrome of dystonia with anarthria/aphonia is broad. Various causes may account for the profound speech disturbance. A practical brain MRI-based algorithm is provided to aid the diagnostic procedure.",

     "abstract": "Transcranial sonography can display structural alterations in the substantia nigra (SN) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), and is considered to be a potential useful tool for the diagnosis of PD. The aim of this study was to assess the correlation between SN echogenicity and clinical features in Chinese patients with PD.A total of 420 subjects including 290 patients with PD and 130 controls were recruited from the neurological clinic or the community. Transcranial sonographic evaluations of the SN were performed in all subjects, and motor and non-motor symptoms were thoroughly assessed by a series of rating scales in PD patients.Two hundred and one patients were successfully assessed by transcranial sonography. SN hyperechogenicity was found to be associated with male sex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), higher scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) part II (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and autonomic symptoms scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Moreover, regression analysis revealed that UPDRS part II scores (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.141, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and gender (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a02.409, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) could be the independent predictors for SN hyperechogenicity; in addition, among all items of UPDRS part II, speech, dressing, hygiene, and turning in bed and adjusting bed clothes significantly correlated with SN hyperechogenicity.This is the first report suggesting the correlation between SN echogenicity and UPDRS part II, and we conclude that increased SN echogenicity might reflect more severe disease disability or poorer medical response.",

The aim of this study was to examine persistency, cross-sectional and longitudinal associations, and risk factors for EDS in patients with PD.Analyses were performed on data from the SCOPA\u2013PROPARK cohort, a 5-year hospital-based longitudinal cohort of over 400 PD patients who were examined annually. Cross-sectional analyses were conducted to evaluate differences between patients with and without EDS at baseline, while linear mixed models using data of all patients were used to identify factors associated with longitudinal changes in SCOPA-SLEEP-Daytime Sleepiness (SCOPA-SLEEP-DS) scores. A survival analysis was done using data of patients without EDS at baseline to identify risk factors for future EDS.EDS proved a non-persistent symptom, although persistency and the proportion of patients with EDS increased with longer follow-up. At baseline 43% of patients had EDS, while 46% of patients without EDS at baseline developed this symptom during follow-up. Male gender, poorer nighttime sleep, cognitive and autonomic dysfunction, hallucinations, less severe dyskinesias, dose of dopamine agonists and use of antihypertensives were associated with higher EDS scores over time, while use of benzodiazepines was associated with lower scores. Baseline SCOPA-SLEEP-DS score and PIGD phenotype were risk factors for future EDS.With longer disease duration a large proportion of patients develop EDS. Some risk factors are modifiable and patients should be monitored to improve quality of life and reduce risk of harm.",

Quality of life (QoL), neuropsychiatric, cognitive and neurological functioning was measured. Patients were classified concerning their subjective outcome (negative\u00a0=\u00a0dissatisfaction; mixed; positive\u00a0=\u00a0satisfaction) at 12mFU using semi-structured interviews. First, the three groups were compared concerning interview statements. Second, repeated measures ANOVAs with group as between-subjects factor were applied to find significant effects of time, group, or interaction. Third, binary logistic regression determined predictors of dissatisfaction.Of the 28 enrolled patients, 25% perceived their outcome as negative, 32.1% as mixed, and 42.9% as positive. Concerning interview statements, dissatisfied patients mentioned significantly less often improved QoL and reduced medication, and reported worsening of mental state, and social interaction. For the whole sample, significant improvement over time was found for motor functioning, daily dopamine dosages, and QoL. Apathy significantly worsened over time, but dissatisfied patients were overall more apathetic and depressed than the other groups. Significant interaction of group and time was identified for QoL, which only improved in the mixed and satisfied group. Finally, preoperative apathy and axial symptoms predicted dissatisfaction with STN-DBS.Although motor symptoms and QoL improved in the whole sample, 25% of patients showed disappointment with STN-DBS. Especially apathy predicts dissatisfaction and should be considered preoperatively.",

FC alterations were correlated with quantitative behavioral measures.ROI-analyses showed decreased FC between the caudate and putamen in PIGD compared to TD. This hypo-connectivity was correlated with behavioral impairment. In contrast, TD-specific hyper-connectivity between motor cortical areas and the inferior parietal lobule correlated with less behavioral impairment, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. Both subgroups showed hyper-connectivity between the left supplementary motor area and pedunculopontine nucleus, whereas PIGD-specific right lateralized hyper-connectivity was shown between this nucleus and the premotor cortex. Whole-brain analyses revealed 65% hypo-connectivity and 35% hyper-connectivity in PIGD compared to TD. TD also revealed primarily hypo-connectivity compared to controls, but had more pronounced hyper-connectivity involving temporo-occipital areas.This multilevel analysis showed differential connectivity alterations in large scale neural networks and between motor and cognitive control areas that related to behavioral heterogeneity in PD, underscoring the classic TD-PIGD phenotypical classification.",

Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Motor Scale scores improved by 50% in the FE condition compared to the off-medication condition. The pattern of fMRI activation after FE was similar to that seen with anti-PD medication.

This current study examined the neural substrates of EDS in drug na\u00efve PD patients.A total of 76 PD patients in the early disease stages were recruited; 16 of them had EDS, while the remaining 60 did not. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to determine group differences (patients with EDS vs. patients without EDS) in spontaneous neural activity indicated by regional homogeneity (ReHo). Additionally, functional connectivity (FC) of the regions showing group differences in ReHo with the entire brain was performed.ReHo analysis controlling for gray matter volume, age, gender, general cognition, depression, postural instability gait difficulty, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder showed decreased ReHo in the left cerebellum and inferior frontal gyrus, but increased ReHo in the left paracentral lobule in PD-EDS patients, compared with patients without EDS. FC analysis controlling for the same variables as in the analysis of ReHo revealed that the three regions showing ReHo differences had decreased FC with regions in the frontal, temporal, insular and limbic lobes and cerebellum in PDs with EDS.While decreases in ReHo and FC were found, increases in ReHo were also noted, implying both neural downregulation and compensatory mechanisms in early PD patients with EDS.

Clinical improvement was short-lasting and rapidly followed by the occurrence of disabling manifestations of MSA that counteracted DBS benefits.Together with previous reports, our study demonstrates that DBS should not be recommended for MSA patients.

However, the lack of live human neurons from PD patients and their heterogeneous pathogenic nature limit mechanistic studies and therefore the development of drugs to modify the disease progression of PD. The evolution of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology makes it possible to generate patient-specific neurons to explore the pathogenesis in individual PD patients.We generated PD-iPSCs from a sporadic early onset PD patient carrying a heterozygous deletion of exon 5 (Ex5del) in PARK2. The expression of \u03b1-synuclein and proteasome and anti-oxidative functions were examined in differentiated iPSC-derived neurons.The neurons derived from our PD-iPSCs demonstrated abnormal \u03b1-synuclein accumulation and down-regulation of the proteasome and anti-oxidative pathways. Environmental triggers such as proteasome inhibitor MG132 and H2O2 markedly induced cell death, while the proteasome enhancer benzamil and anti-oxidative compound genipin significantly rescued these increased susceptibilities.These results demonstrate that unique genetic\u2013environmental interactions are involved in neuronal death in PD patients. Our findings also provide a new model to identify potential disease-modifying strategies and an insight into personalized medicine for patients with PD.",

Thus, we investigated the different effects of deep WMH and periventricular WMH on olfactory and cognitive performance and evaluated the additive effects of the concurrent presence of WMH and olfactory dysfunction on cognitive performance in PD.We enrolled 171 patients with non-demented PD whose WMH scores were assessed using a semi-quantitative visual rating system. The olfactory and cognitive performance was assessed using the Cross-Cultural Smell Identification (CCSI) test and the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery. Additionally, the additive effects of concurrent WMH and olfactory dysfunction on cognitive performance were investigated using binary logistic regression.The deep WMH score exhibited a significant negative correlation with the CCSI score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) but the total WMH and periventricular WMH did not.

Postural control was measured with the Fullerton Advanced Balance (FAB) scale and with center of pressure (COP) analysis during quiet stance and maximal voluntary forward/backward leaning.The groups were balanced concerning age, disease duration and disease severity. PD+FOG performed significantly worse in the FAB scale (21.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8) compared to PD-FOG (25.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0) and HC (34.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4) (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Our results show a relationship between the anterior\u2013posterior COP position during quiet stance and FOG. The COP shift towards posterior in PD+FOG leads to a restricted precondition to generate forward progression during gait initiation.

For each domain a linear mixed-effect model was used to examine changes during follow-up and relations with age and death.Of 378 included patients, 43 died during follow-up. Higher age was associated with increased severity of all nondopaminergic features except depression, and with a higher rate of progression of axial symptoms and cognitive impairment. Patients who died during follow-up had a higher severity of all nondopaminergic features except autonomic dysfunction, and a higher rate of progression of axial symptoms, cognitive impairment, and psychotic symptoms, compared to patients who survived.This study shows that the severity of most nondopaminergic features and the progression rate of axial and psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairment increase before PD patients die, independent of the influence of age. An interaction between age and approaching death did not have a significant effect on the course of the symptoms. Improving our understanding of the fundamental biology underlying these factors and the interaction with factors intrinsic to the disease, may have profound implications for the treatment of PD.",

Whole brain structural imaging was performed on a 3T GE MR scanner. Surface-based investigation of CTh was carried out by using Freesurfer Software. We also used voxel-based morphometry to investigate the pattern of GM atrophy.The voxel-wise analysis of the regional differences in CTh revealed that ICD+\u00a0patients showed a statistically significant (p<0.01 FDR) thicker cortex when compared to both ICD- patients and HCs in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and orbitofrontal (OFC) cortices. Moreover, cortical thickness abnormalities were positively correlated with ICD severity (p<0.05 FDR). VBM data did not reveal any statistically significant differences in local GM.Our results demonstrate that ICD+\u00a0patients have an increased CTh in limbic regions when compared with ICD- patients at the same disease stage and with an equal daily levodopa equivalent dose.

Nocturnal parameters included number, velocity, acceleration, degree, and duration of rolling over, number of getting out of bed, and limb movements. Each activity was compared to sleep diary, and video recording for accuracy.PD patients significantly had fewer rolling over (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), turned with smaller degree (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), less velocity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), and acceleration (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but had more episodes of getting out of bed (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03, nocturia) when compared to their spouses.

We measured dual-task gait velocity using the GAITRite mat and dual-task reaction times and errors on the concurrent tasks as outcomes. Motor, cognitive and descriptive variables which correlated to dual-task performance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.20) were entered into a stepwise forward multiple linear regression model.Single-task gait velocity and executive function, tested by the alternating intake test, was significantly associated with gait velocity during the Digit Span (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.65; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), the Stroop (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.73; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the Mobile Phone task (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.62; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In addition, disease severity proved correlated to gait velocity during the Stroop task. Age was a surplus determinant of gait velocity while using a mobile phone.Single-task gait velocity and executive function as measured by a verbal fluency switching task were independent determinants of dual-task gait performance in people with PD. In contrast to expectation, these factors were the same across different tasks, supporting the robustness of the findings.

In a post-hoc neuroimaging regression model, stratifying the total cohort into mild vs. moderate-to-severe PD, striatal DTBZ uptake was a significant predictor of fatigue in mild but not moderate-to-severe PD. In a clinicometric regression model, higher Beck Depression Inventory-somatic subscore, higher levodopa dose equivalents and younger age were all significant predictors of fatigue in PD, but the MDS-UPDRS non-motor experiences of daily living score was the best predictor overall.Cholinergic uptake was not a predictor of fatigue in PD, but nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation predicted fatigue in mild disease.

Furthermore, animal studies have found that early life inflammation in particular is of relevance for PD pathology.We conducted an unmatched case\u2013control study of 379 neurologist confirmed PD patients and 230 controls from the greater Boston, Massachusetts area with questionnaire data on history of head injury and other covariates. We used multivariable logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) for PD.When we excluded injuries that occurred less than 10 years prior to the diagnosis of PD (in order to avoid reverse causation), we found an increased risk of PD associated with a head injury that resulted in a loss of consciousness, but it did not reach statistical significance (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.57; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.89\u20132.80).

Patients with AES-S scores of 37 or higher were defined as having apathetic PD. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to assess the severity of depression. Patients with BDI scores of 15 or higher were regarded as having depression.Apathetic patients (n\u00a0=\u00a034) tended to exhibit higher BDI scores than non-apathetic patients (n\u00a0=\u00a074); however, other clinical variables were comparable between the two groups. DAT activity in the striatal sub-regions was also similar between the two groups. Selecting only non-depressed patients, including 20 apathetic and 47 non-apathetic patients, did not alter the results.This study demonstrated that the pattern of striatal dopamine depletion does not contribute to the degree of apathy in early PD.

     "abstract": "Many patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) are reluctant to undergo the subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) when surgery is warranted. Reasons for this reluctance have not been examined. We undertook to establish the rate and causes of this reluctance for STN-DBS in patients with advanced PD.A reluctant group was defined as patients who were hesitant to undergo DBS. Clinical information included age, onset age, disease duration, the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr stage and levodopa equivalent dose when they were evaluated with a view to consider surgery.We enrolled 186 patients who underwent STN-DBS. 84 patients (45%) belonged to the reluctant group. Between the reluctant and the non-reluctant, there were no differences in preoperative characteristics. Main reasons for hesitation were fear of complications (74%) and economic burden (50%). The main reasons that they finally underwent the DBS were confidence in the doctor's decision (80%) and encouragement from their family (36%).Building trust between patients and physicians is an important factor in guiding patients to undergo this treatment. To reduce the reluctance to undergo DBS at the appropriate time, we need to find effective ways of reducing their psychological and economic burden.",

Mixed-effects models were used to characterise the individual trajectories of apathy symptom severity, and linear regression with stepwise elimination procedure was used to select significant baseline predictors.Clinically significant levels of apathy were present in 42.7% of our sample at baseline, with symptom severity remaining relatively stable on average over the course of 18 months. Male gender, lower educational attainment, higher depression symptom severity, more severe functional disability, and the presence of dyskinesias at study entry predicted increasing apathy over the subsequent 18 months.Patients with these factors are at risk for progression of apathy, which may be prevented by treating depression and functional disability. Further studies are needed to address both the specific neurobiological pathways and psychosocial factors underpinning apathy in PD.",

Cognitive functions were examined by an extensive battery of neuropsychological tests. In addition, motor and sensory nerve conduction studies and evoked laser potentials were performed. Cardiac sympathetic innervation was assessed in the two patients by 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy, computing early and late heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios and myocardial washout rates (WR).Among the non-motor symptoms and autonomic signs, case 1 had cold intolerance, drooling and dysphagia, while case 2 had pain and urinary dysfunction. Both cases showed mood and behavioural disorders. RBD were not found, whereas the neuropsychological assessment revealed a progressive cognitive impairment. Neurophysiological studies revealed no abnormalities. Indexes of cardiac sympathetic innervation in the two patients did not differ from those of control subjects.Our findings expand the phenotypic profile of SYNJ1-related parkinsonism. Preserved cardiac sympathetic function and absence of RBD suggest that PARK20 should be explained by a pathogenic mechanism different from Lewy Body pathology, or that the latter is not as widespread as idiopathic Parkinson's disease.",

Results of clinical and epidemiological studies as well as studies based on neuroimaging, electrophysiology especially transcranial magnetic stimulation and neuropsycholgical evaluations in PD patients have suggested presence of certain common neurobiological process leading to emergence of RBD, VH and CI. Structural neuroimaging studies using voxel-based morphometry have often reported grey matter atrophy of hippocampus and parahippocampal cortices in PD patients with RBD, VH and CI.

     "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction and neuropsychological symptoms like depression and anhedonia are common non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). The assessment of both functional domains includes clinical examination, olfactory testing, and standardized questionnaires. While olfaction is readily assessed by functional tests, the distinction of anhedonia as a separate symptom from other depressive symptoms is challenging. Thus, a test focusing on the assessment of hedonic olfaction may be helpful in the assessment of neuropsychological symptoms in PD.We examined anhedonia by evaluating the perception of pleasantness of odors in PD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a057) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a046). Pleasantness of odors was registered on a visual 9-point scale. For the assessment of anhedonia we used the Snaith-Hamilton-Pleasure-Scale (SHAPS). Depression was evaluated with the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory II.PD patients showed a substantial reduction in hedonic olfaction compared to controls (hedonic score: 1.5 vs. 2.2). Hyposmia, one of the most prevalent non-motor symptoms in PD, was a confounding factor. However, even normosmic PD patients showed a reduced hedonic olfaction compared to controls (hedonic score: 1.6 vs. 2.2). Furthermore, we observed a correlation between hedonic olfaction and the SHAPS-score for PD patients even though positive SHAPS-rating was observed in 9% of PD patients only, while no correlation to depression was present.These findings suggest that reduced hedonic olfaction might be an additional neuropsychological feature, probably giving insights into changes in hedonic tone complementary to hyposmia and depression in PD.",

Gait, balance, endurance and quality of life were assessed before and after training and at four weeks follow-up using standardized tests.Both groups improved significantly on the primary outcomes (single and dual task gait speed) at post-test and follow-up. The CuPiD group improved significantly more on balance (MiniBESTest) at post-test (from 24.8 to 26.1, SD\u223c5) and maintained quality of life (SF-36 physical health) at follow-up whereas the control group deteriorated (from 50.4 to 48.3, SD\u223c16).

The CuPiD system was well-tolerated and participants found the tool user-friendly.CuPiD was feasible, well-accepted and seemed to be an effective approach to promote gait training, as participants improved equally to controls. This benefit may be ascribed to the real-time feedback, stimulating corrective actions and promoting self-efficacy to achieve optimal performance. Further optimization of the system and adequately-powered studies are warranted to corroborate these findings and determine cost-effectiveness.",

     "abstract": "Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disease which presents heterogeneously with symptoms and signs of parkinsonism, ataxia and autonomic dysfunction. Although MSA typically occurs sporadically, rare pathology-proven MSA families following either autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant patterns have been described, indicating a heritable contribution to the pathogenesis.We used Genome-Wide Complex Trait Analysis (GCTA) to estimate the heritable component of MSA due to common coding variability in imputed genotype data of 907 MSA cases and 3866 population-matched controls. GCTA only assesses the effect of putative causal variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with all common SNPs on the genotyping platform.We estimate the heritability among common variants of MSA in pooled cases at 2.09\u20136.65%, with a wider range of values in geographic and diagnostic subgroups. Meta-analysis of our geographic cohorts reveals high between-group heterogeneity. Contributions of single chromosomes are generally negligible. We suggest that all calculated MSA heritability among common variants could be explained by the presence of misdiagnosed cases in the clinical subgroup based on a Bayesian estimate using literature-derived rates of misdiagnosis.MSA is a challenging disease to study due to high rates of misdiagnosis and low prevalence. Given our low estimates of heritability, common genetic variation appears to play a less prominent role in risk for MSA than in other complex neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. The success of future gene discovery efforts rests on large pathologically-confirmed case series and an interrogation of both common and rare genetic variants.",

However, audiovisual processing shares many cognitive resources used for attention-dependent tasks such as communication, spatial orientation, and balance. Conversely, tactile cues (TC) may be processed faster, with minimal attentional demand, and may be more efficient means for modulating motor-cognitive performance. In this study we aimed to investigate the efficacy and limitations of TC for modulating simple (heel tapping) and more complex (walking) motor tasks (1) over a range of cueing intervals, (2) with/without a secondary motor task (holding tray with cups of water).Ten PD patients (71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 years) and 10 healthy controls (69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07 years) participated in the study.

We performed Kaplan\u2013Meier survival and Cox regression analyses to assess cumulative incidence and risk factors of these motor complications.The 5-year cumulative incidence of motor complications was 52.4%.

Besides higher motor severity predicting both motor fluctuations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) and dyskinesias (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), lower age at diagnosis predicted motor fluctuations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), whereas female gender predicted dyskinesias (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

Forty-nine healthy participants and 130 PD patients underwent serial single voxel proton MRS and neuropsychological testing. At baseline patients were classified as either having normal cognitive status (PDN, n\u00a0=\u00a077), mild cognitive impairment (PDMCI, n\u00a0=\u00a033), or dementia (PDD, n\u00a0=\u00a020). Posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) was examined to quantify N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), and myo-inositol (mI). A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to assess whether cognitive ability and other covariates were related to baseline MRS values and changes in MRS over time.At baseline, relative to controls, PDD had significantly decreased NAA/Cr and increased Cho/Cr. However, these differences did not remain significant after accounting for age, sex, and MDS-UPDRS III. At follow-up, no significant changes in MRS metabolite ratios were detected, with no relationship found between MRS measures and change in cognitive status.Unlike Alzheimer's disease, single voxel MR spectroscopy of the PCC failed to show any significant association with cognitive status at baseline or over time. This suggests that MRS of PCC is not a clinically useful biomarker for tracking or predicting cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease.",

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and clustering analysis were performed to determine the diagnostic usefulness of the selected miRNAs for PD.In this study, we generated a profile of 5 serum miRNAs: miR-195 was up-regulated, and miR-185, miR-15b, miR-221 and miR-181a were down-regulated.This group of five miRNAs can precisely distinguish PD patients from health individuals and may be used as a potential serum-based biomarker for the diagnosis of PD.",

     "abstract": "Hyposmia is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, patients with PD are sometimes unaware of their olfactory dysfunction, resulting in an under-diagnosis of this symptom. To determine whether the loss of awareness of hyposmia results from cognitive impairment in patients with PD, we investigated the relationship between the degree of hyposmia self-awareness and the cognitive status of non-demented PD patients.Thirty-one non-demented patients with PD and 20 healthy controls (HC) were assessed via a self-reported olfactory questionnaire and an odor identification test. PD patients were sub-classified as having mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or as cognitively normal (PD-CN) (according to the current PD-MCI criteria). We compared the degree of hyposmia self-awareness between the PD-MCI and PD-CN groups.The PD-MCI group scored the lowest on the odor identification test among all groups, whereas PD-MCI patients tended to rate their olfactory function higher on the self-reported olfactory questionnaire than PD-CN patients. Differences in the scores of subjective and objective olfactory measures between the PD-MCI and PD-CN groups were significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0069).The loss of awareness of hyposmia is closely associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD patients.",

     "abstract": "Orthostatic hypotension and cognitive impairment are two non-motor attributes of Lewy body spectrum disorders that impact independence. This proof-of-concept study examined cerebral blood flow (perfusion) as a mediator of orthostatic hypotension and cognition.In fifteen patients with Lewy body disorders, we estimated regional perfusion using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling MRI, and quantified orthostatic hypotension from the change in systolic blood pressure between supine and standing positions. Executive, visuospatial, attention, memory, and language domains were characterized by neuropsychological tests. A matching sample of non-demented adults with cerebral small vessel disease was obtained to contrast perfusion patterns associated with comorbid vascular pathology.Compared to the vascular group, patients with Lewy body disorders exhibited lower perfusion to temporal and occipital lobes than to frontal and parietal lobes (q\u00a0<\u00a00.05). A greater orthostatic drop in systolic pressure was associated with lower occipito-parietal perfusion in these patients (uncorrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.005; cluster size\u00a0\u2265\u00a020 voxels). Although orthostatic hypotension and supine hypertension were strongly correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.79, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), the patterns of association for each with perfusion were distinct. Specifically, supine hypertension was associated with high perfusion to anterior and middle cerebral arterial territories, as well as with low perfusion to posterior regions. Perfusion within orthostatic hypotension-defined regions was directly related to performance on visuospatial and attention tasks, independent of dementia severity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).These findings provide new insight that regional cerebral hypoperfusion is related to orthostatic hypotension, and may be involved in domain-specific cognitive deficits in Lewy body disorders.",

Depressive symptoms were associated with SARA scores but did not significantly progress over time within 2 years or deteriorate by increased numbers of pathological CAG repeats. The effects of depression on ataxia progression varied across different SCA types. Nevertheless, depression had consistently negative and significant impact on functional status and quality of life in all SCAs, even after accounting for ataxia progression.Depressive symptoms are not simply the consequence of motor disability in SCAs.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is one such gait disturbance that significantly impacts mobility and quality of life in PD. Recent evidence suggests that cerebellar connectivity may differ in people with PD and FOG (PD+FOG) relative to those without FOG (PD-FOG). Investigation of gait adaptation, or the ability to change gait patterns in response to external perturbations, is cerebellum-dependent, is a practical means of probing cerebellar integrity and may provide additional insights regarding the FOG phenomenon.In this study, we investigated gait adaptation in PD and FOG by measuring after-effects, namely whole-body rotation, following stepping on a rotating disc in PD+FOG compared to PD-FOG and older healthy adults. We refer to the period of stepping on the rotating disc as the podokinetic (PK) stimulation and after-effects as podokinetic after-rotation (PKAR). Our primary measure of adaptation was the magnitude and rate of decay of the after-effects.We noted that PKAR was diminished in PD+FOG compared to the other groups, indicating reduced storage of the adapted gait pattern in PD+FOG. In the PD groups, FOG explained about 20% of the variability in peak velocity. Furthermore, these differences were independent of stepping cadence or motor sign severity.Our results show that gait adaptation is impaired in PD+FOG, suggesting the cerebellum may be differentially impacted in PD+FOG compared to PD-FOG. This supports previous neuroimaging evidence of cerebellar dysfunction in PD+FOG. Overall, these data further our understanding of gait deficits in PD+FOG.",

One contributing factor may be the dearth of studies that focus on the nuances of clinical phenomenology. A clinical feature that has received relatively little attention is head tremor. Indeed, there is no consensus regarding the predominant direction of head tremor in ET, and no study has examined the clinical correlates of directionality.We identified 51 ET cases with head tremor enrolled in a clinical-epidemiological study of ET at Columbia University. Each had a videotaped neurological examination. Videotapes were viewed and coded by a movement disorders neurologist for head tremor direction (\u201cno\u2013no\u201d, \u201cyes\u2013yes\u201d, or mixed) and continuity (continuous, intermittent, or rare).

While recent large meta-analyses reported that genetic variation of dopamine (DRD2, DRD3) and glutamine (NMDA, GRIN2B) neurotransmitter receptors was not associated with PD risk, they could conceivably influence PD phenotype. We studied the association of these receptor polymorphisms relating to PD age of onset.There were 664 PD patients and 718 controls, all Caucasian, with stored DNA at Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida. Genotyping was performed for DRD2 (Taq 1A, rs1800497), DRD3 (rs6280), and NMDA (GRIN2B, rs7301328) polymorphisms with ABI Taqman assays. Single nucleotide polymorphism associations with age of onset were evaluated using dominant, recessive, and additive genotypic models.DRD3 variant carriers had an approximate 4.4-year decrease in mean age of onset when both copies of the minor allele were present (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0034) and an approximate 1.5-year decrease in mean age at onset for every additional minor allele (P\u00a0=\u00a00.023) (recessive and additive models, respectively).

Several lines of evidence suggest tau aggregation is central to the neurodegenerative process in tauopathies. First, recent animal and cell model studies find abnormally-modified tau alone may be transmitted between adjacent neurons and spread to anatomically connected brain regions to recapitulate human disease. Further, staging efforts in human autopsy cases suggest a sequential distribution of tau aggregation in the central nervous system that could reflect this observed cell-to-cell transmission of pathogenic tau species in animal models. Finally, pathogenic mutations in the MAPT gene encoding tau protein cause hereditary forms of tauopathy.Clinically, tauopathies can present with a range of phenotypes that include both movement- and cognitive/behavioral-disorders (i.e. frontotemporal dementia spectrum disorders) or non-specific amnestic symptoms in advanced age. A major limitation is that current clinical diagnostic criteria for these disorders do not reliably differentiate underlying tauopathy from other neurodegenerative diseases, such as TDP-43 proteinopathies.

     "abstract": "Rehabilitation is considered as an adjuvant to pharmacological and surgical treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD) to maximize functional ability and minimize secondary complications. Originally, approaches were based on empirical experience, but growing evidence suggests that exercise-dependent plasticity constitutes the main mechanism underlying the effects of physiotherapy. Exercise increases synaptic strength and influences neurotransmission, thus potentiating functional circuitry in PD. In addition, exercise is a pivotal element of motor learning. PD patients retain a sufficient capacity of motor learning, though learning rates and performance are reduced in comparison to normal controls. Recent meta-analyses demonstrated that rehabilitation could induce short-lasting, but clinically important benefits, particularly for gait and balance. However, the interventions are largely heterogeneous (stretching, muscle strengthening, balance, postural exercises, occupational therapy, cueing, treadmill training), and there is still no consensus about the optimal approach. Innovative techniques have been recently proposed: virtual reality and exergaming, motor imagery and action observation, robot-assisted physiotherapy and non-conventional therapies (e.g.: dance, martial arts). The rehabilitative program for PD should be \u201cgoal-based\u201d (targeted to practicing and learning specific activities in the core areas), but a number of practice variables (intensity, specificity, complexity) need to be identified and the program should tailored to the individual patients' characteristics.",

     "abstract": "Hippocampus and striatum play distinctive roles in memory processes since declarative and non-declarative memory systems may act independently. However, hippocampus and striatum can also be engaged to function in parallel as part of a dynamic system to integrate previous experience and adjust behavioral responses. In these structures the formation, storage, and retrieval of memory require a synaptic mechanism that is able to integrate multiple signals and to translate them into persistent molecular traces at both the corticostriatal and hippocampal/limbic synapses. The best cellular candidate for this complex synthesis is represented by long-term potentiation (LTP). A common feature of LTP expressed in these two memory systems is the critical requirement of convergence and coincidence of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs to the dendritic spines of the neurons expressing this form of synaptic plasticity. In experimental models of Parkinson's disease abnormal accumulation of \u03b1-synuclein affects these two memory systems by altering two major synaptic mechanisms underlying cognitive functions in cholinergic striatal neurons, likely implicated in basal ganglia dependent operative memory, and in the CA1 hippocampal region, playing a central function in episodic/declarative memory processes.",

RBD manifests itself clinically as a violent behaviour occurring during the night, and is detected at the polysomnography by phasic and/or tonic muscle activity on the electromyography channel. In absence of neurological signs or central nervous system lesions, RBD is defined as idiopathic. Nevertheless, in a large number of cases the development of neurodegenerative diseases in RBD patients has been described, with the duration of the follow-up representing a fundamental aspect. A growing number of clinical, neurophysiologic and neuropsychological studies aimed to detect early markers of neurodegenerative dysfunction in RBD patients. Anyway, the evidence of impaired cortical activity, subtle neurocognitive dysfunction, olfactory and autonomic impairment and neuroimaging brain changes in RBD patients is challenging the concept of an idiopathic form of RBD, supporting the idea of RBD as an early manifestation of a more complex neurodegenerative process.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder, resulting in both motor and non-motor symptoms that significantly reduce quality of life. Treatment consists of both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical treatment approaches. Neurorehabilitation is an important non-pharmaceutical treatment approach, and a prime component of this is formed by the training of behavioural adaptations that can assist patients to cope better with their motor and non-motor symptoms. Optimal delivery of neurorehabilitation requires a tailor-made, personalized approach. In this review we discuss the great potential for growth in the field of neurorehabilitation. Specifically, we will focus on four relatively new developments: visual rehabilitation (because Parkinson patients are very dependent on optimal vision); cueing delivered by wearable devices (allowing for objective, continuous, and quantitative detection of mobility problems, such that cueing can be delivered effectively in an on-demand manner \u2013 i.e., with external cues being delivered only at a time when they are needed most); exergaming (to promote compliance with exercise programs); and telemedicine (allowing for delivery of expert rehabilitation advice to the patient's own home). Evidence in these new fields is growing, based on good clinical trials, fuelling hope that state-of-the-art neurorehabilitation can make a real impact on improving the quality of life of patients affected by Parkinson's disease.",

The development of biomarkers will not only help the scientific community to identify populations at risk, but also facilitate clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, these tools could monitor progression, which could ultimately deliver personalized therapeutic strategies.

For this reason, adaptive DBS (aDBS), where stimulation is applied according to the level of pathological activity, might be advantageous. Initial studies of aDBS demonstrate effectiveness in PD, but there are still many questions to be answered before aDBS can be applied clinically.

Evidence suggests that nocturnal hypokinesia exists even in patients in the early stages, and PD patients turned significantly less and with much slower speed and acceleration than controls, partly related to low nocturnal dopamine level. We conducted another systematic review to evaluate the evidence of the efficacy of dopaminergic agents in the treatment of nocturnal hypokinesia. Several lines of evidence support the use of long-acting drugs or by continuous administration of short-acting agents to control symptoms.

Cognitive impairment is usually the initial symptom of DLB, and the disease course is severe. A variety of biomarkers can assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of PD and DLB, including structural and functional imaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and EEG. Compared to the many treatments available for motor symptoms, relatively few systematic studies exist to guide the treatment of cognitive impairment in PD, and even less in DLB. However, there is good evidence for cholinesterase inhibitors in both DLB and PD with dementia, and some indications that memantine is helpful. Emerging evidence suggest that physical exercise and cognitive training are also effective, as are some reports of various brain stimulation techniques.

The diagnosis of PMD is challenging for both neurologist and psychiatrist. Electrophysiological examination is a useful tool to evaluate and support a diagnosis PMD. It includes a set of tests which are chosen appropriate to the clinical setting that provides objective criteria for the diagnosis of PMD. The various tests available include accelerometry, surface electromyography, electroencephalography, jerk locked back averaging and pre-movement potentials, somatosensory evoked potentials, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) etc. Electrophysiologically psychogenic tremors display features of variability, entrainability, coactivation, distractibility and increase in the amplitude and frequency on mass loading. Movement related cortical potentials such as Bereitschaftspotential is seen in psychogenic myoclonus. Presence of triphasic contraction of muscles and absence of co-contraction suggests psychogenic myoclonus. Latency of C-reflex is longer in psychogenic myoclonus as compared to organic myoclonus. The role of TMS to differentiate psychogenic from organic dystonia is still not clear. In conclusion, electrophysiological tests are most useful for tremor, followed by jerks and least for dystonia.

Although distinct clinical-pathological entities, both disorders may share overlapping features in addition to rest and postural tremor, such as bradykinesia, rigidity, gait and balance impairment and some non-motor signs. A subset of patients may have a combination of long-standing ET with subsequent PD (ET-PD). There are several lines of evidence from clinical, epidemiologic, imaging, genetic and pathologic studies supporting a link between ET and PD, greater than by chance alone. In this review we will discuss the latest data supporting a relationship between ET and PD and the implications for possible pathogenic link and treatment.",

A search of PUBMED and Googlescholar.com revealed eleven studies that met the inclusion criteria: diagnosis based on the United Kingdom Brain Bank criteria (UK BBC); cognitive assessment; WML assessed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) by semiquantitative visual scales or automated method.Eight studies described the negative impact of WML on cognition in PD. Patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia had significantly more WML than the group without MCI and dementia. There was significant relationship between increasing total WML volume and worse performance on executive function, memory and language. Patients with vascular parkinsonism and dopaminergic denervation had more severe frontal lobe dysfunctions than patients with PD. In contrast in three studies there was no negative correlation between WML and cognition. Although the progression of neurodegenerative process in advanced stage of PD has been recognized as being mainly responsible for cognitive impairment in PD, WML may also be a contributing factor. It is possible that by reducing the vascular risk factors that cause WML cognitive impairment could be prevented or slowed down.",

     "abstract": "While no real breakthrough in the medical treatment of Essential Tremor (ET) has recently emerged, surgical field is expanding exponentially. Purpose of this review is to examine the recent and future developments of the surgical treatments for ET.Technological advances are shaping the present and the future application of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in ET. New electrode configurations as well as new implantable pulse generators are now available. Application of closed-loop or adaptive stimulation in clinical practice will allow DBS to deliver stimulation in a truly physiological way to restore aberrant neurological circuits on demand, thus avoiding side effects, tolerance and also saving the battery life.Besides DBS and standard thalamotomy, novel surgical approaches for ET are on the horizon. The development of MRI-guided focused ultrasound technique has been the new frontier of deep brain lesional therapies. Although the benefit of motor cortex stimulation is yet to be defined, this minimally invasive approach remains intriguing.Although the advances of surgical treatments along the clinical and technological directions described in this review will certainly contribute to a successful management of ET patients, future studies need to consider critical issues such as the heterogeneity of ET and the development of tolerance.",

Recent discoveries linking LINGO1, FUS and TENM4 to essential tremor have been met with cautious optimism since reproducibility and pathogenicity have been contentious in previously implicated genes. The lack of gold standard diagnostic criteria together with clinical and genetic heterogeneity have presented considerable obstacles. Nevertheless, future genetic studies should adopt a multi-prong genomic approach with adequate sample size, supported by both functional in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo studies.

     "abstract": "Cerebral autoregulation is a complex homeostatic process which ensures constant brain blood supply, despite continuous blood pressure fluctuations. Recent evidence suggests that in Parkinson's disease (PD) and multiple system atrophy (MSA) this process is maintained in a broadened range of blood pressure values, consistent with an adaptive mechanism to increase tolerance to orthostatic hypotension. In PD and MSA orthostatic hypotension may be accompanied by supine hypertension which has been recently linked with cerebral white matter lesions in these conditions. We hypothesize that cerebral autoregulation adaptation to chronic orthostatic hypotension may be directly related with an increase susceptibility to hypertensive peaks.Evaluation of cerebral autoregulatory behavior may thus represent a novel approach to simultaneously target orthostatic symptoms and silent end-organ damage in alpha-synucleinopathies, with a beneficial impact on cerebrovascular and cognitive outcome.",

     "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized as a key factor in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative conditions. However, it remains unclear whether it has a protective or damaging role. Studies of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease have provided much of the evidence for inflammatory pathology in neurodegeneration. Here we review the evidence for inflammation in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia.Neuroinflammation has been confirmed in\u00a0vivo using PET imaging, with microglial activation seen in Parkinson's disease dementia and recently in dementia with Lewy bodies. In Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease dementia, microglial activation suggests a chronic inflammatory process, although there is also evidence of its association with cognitive ability and neuronal function.Alpha-synuclein in various conformations has also been linked to activation of microglia, with a broad range of components of the innate and adaptive immune systems associated with this interaction.Evidence of neuroinflammation in Lewy body dementia is further supported by pathological and biomarker studies. Genetic and epidemiological studies support a role for inflammation in Parkinson's disease, but have yet to provide the same for Lewy body dementia.This review highlights the need to identify whether the nature and extent of microglial activation in Lewy body dementia can be linked to structural change, progression of domain specific cognitive symptoms and peripheral inflammation as a marker of central microglial pathology. Answers to these questions will enable the evaluation of immunotherapies as potential therapeutic options for prevention or treatment of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia.",

Delayed gastric emptying, progressing to gastroparesis, is reported in up to 100% of patients with PD, and it occurs at all stages of the disease with severe consequences to the patient's quality of life. The presence of \u03b1-synuclein (\u03b1-syn) aggregates in myenteric neurons throughout the digestive tract, as well as morpho-functional alterations of the enteric nervous system (ENS), have been documented in PD. In particular, gastric dysmotility in PD has been associated with an impairment of the brain-gut axis, involving the efferent fibers of the vagal pathway projecting directly to the gastric myenteric plexus. The present review intends to provide an integrated overview of available knowledge on the possible role played by the ENS, considered as a semi-autonomous nervous network, in the pathophysiology of gastric dysmotility in PD. Particular attention has been paid review how translational evidence in humans and studies in pre-clinical models are allowing a better understanding of the functional, neurochemical and molecular alterations likely underlying gastric motor abnormalities occurring in PD.",

Moreover, sporadic PD and GBA-PD patients presented with lower levels of t-Tau and p-Tau whereas this phenomenon was not seen in LRRK2-PD patients. Regression analyses revealed an association between higher levels of Baseline p-Tau with more accelerated cognitive deterioration over time in LRRK2-PD and GBA-PD patients, but not in sporadic PD.PD patients present with disease-specific CSF profiles of A\u03b21-42, t-Tau and p-Tau arguing in favor of an involvement of these proteins in PD pathogenesis in both sporadic and genetic forms. Moreover, we found first hints for differences in these CSF profiles between genetically determined PD cohorts but that CSF constellations which tend to predict aspects of disease progression such as cognitive decline seem similar across subgroups of PD.",

We selected 32 genetic variants from 11 genes (CDC123, CDKAL1, CDKN2B, FTO, GLIS3, HHEX, IGF2BP2, KCNJ11, KCNQ1, SLC30A8, and TCF7L2) and intergenic regions based on results of recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in T2DM. These variants were reported to be T2DM-susceptibility loci and have been replicated in other independent studies. All association analyses were performed using logistic regression models, adjusting for age and sex.KCNQ1 SNP rs163182 showed the strongest association with AD, but it was not significant after Bonferroni correction (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.30, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.07\u20131.59, Pcorrected\u00a0=\u00a00.32).

The Burke-Marsden-Fahn Dystonia Rating Scale was employed to quantify dystonia severity. Patients with dystonia received levodopa 600\u00a0mg/day for 2 months and were videotaped before and after treatment. A blinded evaluator rated dystonia in the videos. Patients with disabling dystonia who failed to respond to levodopa treatment received botulinum toxin. Finally, volumetric T1 and diffusion tensor imaging sequences were obtained in the dystonic group using a 3T-MRI scanner to identify areas of gray and white matter that were selectively damaged.There were 21 patients with dystonia (28%): 9 classified as generalized and 12 as focal/segmental. Patients with dystonia had earlier onset and larger (CAG) expansions (28.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.7 vs 40.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and 75 vs 70; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively). Although group analyses failed to show benefit on levodopa (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07), some patients had objective improvement. In addition, ten patients received botulinum toxin resulting in a significant change in dystonia scores after 4 weeks (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Patients with dystonia had atrophy at pre- and paracentral cortices; whereas, non-dystonic patients had occipital atrophy. Basal ganglia volume was reduced in both groups, but atrophy at the thalami, cerebellar white matter and ventral diencephali was disproportionately higher in the dystonic group.Dystonia in Machado\u2013Joseph disease is frequent and often disabling, but may respond to levodopa.

The pathophysiology underlying these differences remains largely unknown. This study investigated whether the two subtypes differ in the pattern of dysfunction in striatal (caudate and putamen) dopaminergic system and if the dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging patterns are associated with the clinical features of corresponding PD subtype.We assessed the spatial pattern of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in 40 YOPD and 47 LOPD with early to mid-stage PD with DAT imaging by positron emission tomography. Two sub-regional parameters (caudate/putamen ratio and asymmetry index) were calculated to measure the spatial pattern of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction.The caudate/anterior putamen ratios were significantly higher in YOPD than that in the LOPD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03 contralateral to the most affected side of the body and P\u00a0=\u00a00.004 ipsilateral), which was supported by significantly inverse correlations between age of onset and caudate/anterior putamen ratios (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.428, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for the contralateral and r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.576, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for the ipsilateral). Sub-regional DAT binding in caudate ipsilateral to affected limbs was significantly correlated with age, while DAT bindings in putamen were significantly inversely correlated with disease duration and UPDRS motor scores.The YOPD subtype suffers from an uneven pattern of dopaminergic dysfunction: more sparing of the caudate compared with the putamen, while the LOPD patients is with a relatively uniform pattern.",

Our objective was to confirm prospectively a previous exploratory cluster analysis based on retrospective data that identified five cognitive phenotypes in PD.A model-based confirmatory cluster analysis was conducted on the results of neuropsychological tests administered in 156 PD patients from two European movement disorder centers (Lille, n\u00a0=\u00a081; Maastricht, n\u00a0=\u00a075). The number of clusters was determined on the basis of statistical criteria as well as clinical plausibility. A factorial discriminant analysis assessed the quality of the clusters' separation.A five-cluster model was statistically superior and clinically the most relevant. These clusters can be described as follows: 1) cognitively intact patients with high level of performance in all cognitive domains (25.64%), 2) cognitively intact patients slightly slower than those in cluster 1 (26.92%), 3) patients with deficits in executive functions (37.18%), 4) patients with severe deficits in all cognitive domains, particularly executive functions (3.20%), 5) patients with severe deficits in all cognitive domains, particularly working memory and recall in verbal episodic memory (7.05%). The groups differed in terms of age, apathy and frequency of hallucinations that were all higher in the clusters with cognitive deficits, and the duration of formal education was lower in those groups.We confirm our previous exploratory analysis. Cognitive disorders in PD patients are heterogeneous and can be separated in five clusters ranging from patients with performance in the normal range to patients with severe disorders in all cognitive domains.",

The Attention Network Test (ANT) is a rapid, widely used test to measure the efficiency of three attentional networks, i.e. alerting, orienting and executive, by evaluating reaction times (RTs) in response to visual stimuli. The aim of this study was to investigate attentional functioning in ET patients by means of the ANT.21 non-demented patients with ET and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls performed the ANT.RT was significantly longer in ET patients than in controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Moreover, a significant difference in alerting and executive efficiency (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.01 respectively) was found between groups, while the difference in the orienting efficiency only bordered on significance.Our results point to a difficulty in the alerting and executive domains of attention in ET patients, probably owing to a dysfunction in the cerebello-thalamo-cortical loop. These selective attentional deficits are not related to clinical motor symptoms, contributing to shed further light on the clinical picture of ET.",

Furthermore at each time point the intraclass correlation coefficient between the two measures was very high (ICC range 0.93\u20130.96). Similarly, the two measures gave very similar accounts of change (e.g. from baseline to follow up at one year effect sizes were 0.18 for the single index calculated using the PDQ-39, and 0.09 when calculated using the PDQ-8). Similar levels of correlation were found between the two indices when correlated with the HY scale.The PDQ-8 closely replicates results gained from the PDQ-39 when calculating single indices. In instances where a single summary score of the impact of PD on self-reported quality of life is needed, it is likely the PDQ-8 will provide reliable and accurate information.",

Although neuronal firing rate changes in the globus pallidus internus (GPi) and externus (GPe) are reported to underlie the development of PD motor signs, firing rates change inconsistently, vary confoundingly with some therapies, and are poor indicators of symptom severity.We explored the relationship between parkinsonian symptom severity and the effectiveness with which pallidal neurons transmit information. We quantify neuronal entropy and information \u2013 alternatives to firing rate and correlations respectively \u2013 in and between GPe and GPi neurons using a progressive, 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, non-human primate model of PD.Neuronal entropy and symptom severity were not linearly correlated: in both pallidal segments, entropy increased from naive to moderate parkinsonism, but decreased with further progression to the severely parkinsonian condition. In contrast, information transmitted from GPe to GPi increased consistently with symptom severity. Furthermore, antidromic information from GPi to GPe increased substantially with symptom severity. Together, these findings suggest that as parkinsonian severity increases, more and more information enters GPe and GPi from common sources, diminishing the relative importance of the orthodromic GPe to GPi connection.With parkinsonian progression, the direct and indirect pathways lose their independence and start to convey redundant information. We hypothesize that a loss of parallel processing impairs the ability of the network to select and implement motor commands, thus promoting the hypokinetic symptoms of PD.",

Here, we evaluate whether accelerometry can detect FOG while executing rapid full turns and while walking with rapid short steps (the two most common provoking circumstances for FOG).We included 23 PD patients, who all had objective FOG. Participants performed several walking tasks, including walking rapidly with short steps and rapid full turns in both directions with a triaxial linear waist-mounted accelerometer. Two independent experts identified FOG episodes using off-line video-analysis (gold standard). A validated algorithm [ratio between pathological freezing (3\u20138\u00a0Hz)-and normal locomotor frequencies (0.5\u20133\u00a0Hz)] was applied on the accelerometer data to detect FOG episodes.Clinically, FOG was most often observed during full rapid turns (81% of all episodes), followed by walking with short rapid steps (12% of all episodes). During full rapid turns, accelerometry yielded a sensitivity of 78% and specificity of 59%. A sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 69% was observed during walking rapidly with small steps. Combining all tasks rendered a sensitivity of 75% and specificity of 76%.Our results suggest that FOG can be detected from a single lumbar accelerometer during several walking tasks, including full rapid turns and walking with short steps rapidly, with reasonable sensitivity and specificity. This approach holds promise for possible implementation as complementary objective outcome in a research setting, but more work remains needed to improve the sensitivity and specificity.",

MEDLINE, and life science journals were searched by querying appropriate key words, but revealed very few publications in this area. However, early evidence suggested that PD patients do not enjoy an adequate P-E fit in their own homes and face more functional limitations compared to matched controls.

If cognitive impairment is mild, use deep brain stimulation (DBS) with caution. For patients who have cognitive impairment or dementia, intrajejunal levodopa infusion is considered as both therapeutic and palliative in some countries. Falls are linked to cognitive decline and are likely to become more frequent with device-aided therapies.\u2022 Insufficient control of motor complications (or drug-resistant tremor in the case of DBS) are indications for device-aided therapies.

Striatal synaptosomes prepared from hG2019S mice assessed vesicular release of dopamine and its sensitivity to D2 autoreceptor stimulation.Genetic ablation of LRRK2 has no long-term consequences on motor or cognitive function. Consistently, no effects on behavior or dopaminergic fiber density were observed following acute striatal silencing. Conversely, 12-month OE mice show persistent locomotor deficits and worsening of cognitive abilities; whereas, hG2019S mice display early hyperactivity and effective learning and memory that progress to decreased motor and cognitive deficits at older ages. The G2019S mutation does not affect vesicular dopamine release, but decreases its sensitivity to D2-mediated inhibition.LRRK2 silencing is well tolerated in mouse, arguing PD does not result from LRRK2 loss of function. High levels of WT and G2019S LRRK2 produce similar but temporally distinct phenotypes, potentially modeling different stages of disease progression. The data implicate gain of LRRK2 function in the pathogenesis of PD.",

     "abstract": "Though Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily a disease of the basal ganglia, recent evidence suggests that PD affects the retina.The study was designed to evaluate the thickness of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) and thickness and volume of the macula in PD and hence explore the utility of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in studying retinal changes in PD.A prospective, hospital based evaluation of 30 patients with PD and 30 healthy controls was carried out. Various parameters such as RNFL, central macular thickness (CMT), central and total macular volumes (TMV) and retinal thickness were analyzed using OCT.(a) RNFL thickness was not significantly different between the patients and controls. A significant negative correlation was found between the RNFL thickness in the right nasal superior sector and the UPDRS motor score. (b) CMT was found to be significantly reduced in the right eye and a negative correlation with the UPDRS motor score was noted. (c) TMV was significantly greater in patients compared to the controls. (d) The outer retinal layer in the right nasal quadrant and the right inferior quadrants were found to be significantly thinner in patients with PD.We did not find any significant abnormality in the RNFL thickness in patients with PD. Decreased CMT in patients with PD and a significant negative correlation of RNFL thickness and CMT with severity of PD suggest a remote possibility of dopaminergic depletion in the retina. However long term studies are warranted to validate our findings.",

Continuous outcomes were also analyzed for this focused cohort.A post hoc analysis was conducted on all subjects from the pilot and a subset of subjects taking PD medications 1\u20134 years at enrollment. Clinically important worsening is defined as both a\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 point increase in UPDRS Part III and a\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 point increase in Part IV.DBS plus optimal drug therapy (DBS\u00a0+\u00a0ODT) subjects experienced a 50\u201380% reduction in the relative risk of worsening after two years.

Although patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) show deficits in (non-moral) decision making and related neuropsychological functions, i.e. executive functions, theory of mind (ToM), and empathy, moral decision-making has rarely been examined in PD patients. We examined possible alterations of moral decision-making and associated functions in PD.Twenty non-demented PD patients and 23 age- and education-matched healthy control participants were examined with tests that assess reasoning, executive functions (set-shifting and planning), ToM and empathy, decision-making under risk, and moral intuitions. Moral decision-making was assessed with a close-to-everyday moral dilemma paradigm that opposes socially oriented \u201caltruistic\u201d choices to self-beneficial \u201cegoistic\u201d choices in 20 moral dilemma short stories (10 high and 10 low emotional). Concurrently, electrodermal activity was recorded.PD patients made more egoistic moral decisions than healthy controls. Remarkably, while reasoning, planning and empathy correlated with moral decision-making in the control group, in the PD group neuropsychological functions and dopaminergic medication did not correlate with moral decisions. No evidence for reduced skin conductance responses in PD patients and no relationships between skin conductance responses and moral decisions were observed.This study provides evidence for moral decision-making dysfunctions in PD patients who made more egoistic moral decisions. As a possible underlying mechanism, reduced exercise of attentional control due to a dysfunctional interplay between the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia is discussed. Future research will have to determine the impact of PD patients' moral decision-making dysfunctions on everyday life and further determine correlates of the deficits.",

Self-reported PD cases were invited for a neurological examination and diagnoses were made by a movement disorder specialist.This cohort had very few smokers (2.7%), alcohol drinkers (2.3%), and post-menopausal hormone users (4.3%); however, tea drinking (29.9%) and exposure to tobacco smoke from husbands (61.8%) were common. A total of 301 participants reported PD diagnosis during the follow-up. The diagnosis was confirmed in 76 (57%) of the 133 clinically examined patients. An additional 19 (53%) PD cases were identified out of 36 participants who self-confirmed the diagnosis and provided a history on PD symptoms and treatments. As expected, increasing age was strongly associated with PD risk. Further, PD risk appears to be inversely associated with exposures to second-hand tobacco smoke from husbands and tea drinking, and positively with education, although none of these reached statistical significance. The age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.7 (95% confidence interval: 0.4\u20131.1) for participants whose husbands were current smokers at baseline and 0.8 (0.5\u20131.3) for ever tea-drinkers.

This study aims to better understand end-of-life care in PD using data from the Oregon POLST and Death Registries.Oregon death certificates from the years 2010\u20132011 were analyzed. Death certificates were matched with forms in the Oregon POLST Registry. Descriptive analyses were performed for both the full PD dataset as well as those with POLST forms.There were 1073 (1.8%) decedents with PD listed as a cause of death and 56,961 without. Three hundred and seventy three (35%) decedents with PD had a POLST form. POLST preferences were not significantly different between those with or without PD, however location of death was; hospital (13% PD vs 24% without p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), home (32% vs 40% p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and care facility (52% vs 29% p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Fifteen patients were identified to have an unusual dystonia affecting the hyoid muscles.Patients presented with a triad of speech resonance changes (100%), anterior neck tightness (86.6%), and dysphagia (73.3%). Ten (66.7%) patients presented with all three symptoms, while fourteen (93.3%) had at least two. Fourteen patients (93.3%) had a concomitant dystonia affecting the face or neck and eleven (73.3%) had a sensory trick. Exam universally showed contracted hyoid muscles. Some patients had professions or hobbies requiring prolonged use of vocal muscles such as teachers, singers, and musicians. Patients were often misdiagnosed and received unnecessary treatments. Patients underwent botulinum toxin injections into various hyoid muscles with benefit in 71% of patients but adverse effects in the same proportion.Hyoid muscle dystonia is a previously poorly characterized focal dystonia causing the triad of speech changes, anterior neck tightness, and dysphagia. Concomitant dystonia, sensory tricks, and visualization of contracted hyoid muscles were often present. Recognition of this disease may reduce unnecessary testing and treatments, and patients may benefit from botulinum toxin injections.",

Point estimates and standard errors were extracted from individual studies and were combined by generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird. Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran's Q test and I2 statistics.Three case-control studies and two cohort studies were identified and included in the data analysis. The pooled risk ratio of PD in patients with gout was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.09). The statistical heterogeneity was high with an I2 of 87%. The results were not significantly different between males and females (RR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.39 and RR 0.95; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.19, respectively).This study did not provide support for an inverse relationship between gout and risk of PD.",

Previous studies have shown changes in composition and secretion of saliva in patients with PD, including an increase in salivary DJ-1 concentration. Autonomic dysfunction is a known feature of PD and could contribute to abnormal salivary gland function.In this pilot cross-sectional study, characterisation of the saliva of 16 patients with PD and 22 age-matched controls was performed. Salivary DJ-1 concentration was measured with quantitative immunoblotting; total protein concentration with a BCA assay and spectrophotometry; amylase with an amylase activity assay; albumin with an ELISA and mucin concentration with periodic-acid Schiff staining of SDS-gels.Patient saliva showed an increase in both total protein concentration (8.4 vs 5.0\u00a0mg/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) and DJ-1 concentration (0.84 vs 0.42\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), but there was no difference in salivary DJ-1 after adjusting for total protein concentration. In patients, adjusted DJ-1 levels correlated with disease severity measured with the MDS-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). Patient saliva had elevated concentrations of amylase (127 vs 64 units/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0005) and albumin (110 vs 47\u03bcg/ml, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003) but not mucins.This study suggests that the saliva of patients with PD is different in composition to that of healthy age-matched controls, supporting the notion that saliva may be a good candidate for biomarker discovery in PD. The specific differences suggest that major salivary glands and gingival crevicular fluid may both be sources of additional DJ-1 and protein in patient saliva.",

LEVEL-1 evaluation (short screening test) was compared to LEVEL-2 examination (extensive neuropsychological gold standard assessment). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated for LEVEL-1 compared to LEVEL-2. Two Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) cut-off scores were evaluated (<26 according to MDS procedures for the diagnosis of PDD and <27 which has proven more sensitive in a recent study proposing a short procedure for PDD screening).According to these criteria, 11.7% of MSA patients were demented on LEVEL-2 examination. LEVEL-1 examination showed strong specificity (96.9%) and negative predictive value (94.1%), while sensitivity (53.8%) and positive predictive (70%) value were moderate compared to LEVEL-2 evaluation. Sensitivity increased to 84.6% when using a MMSE threshold <27 for LEVEL-1. Executive dysfunction was the main prevalent finding (52% of all patients), while impairment of memory (15%), language (14%) and visuospatial functions was less frequent (13%).Our findings suggest that the MDS PDD short screening test may be useful for the diagnosis of MSA dementia.",

While several follow-up studies confirmed the importance of TUBB4A mutations in the development of H-ABC, their contribution to isolated dystonia remains uncertain.We screened the TUBB4A coding regions in a large population of 709 isolated dystonia patients of German/Austrian ancestry as well as in 376 ancestry-matched control subjects by means of Sanger sequencing and high-resolution melting. In addition, we assessed the overall frequency of rare non-synonymous TUBB4A genetic variation in the huge exome dataset released by the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC).We were unable to identify any possibly pathogenic sequence alteration in either patients or controls. According to ExAC, the overall prevalence of rare missense and loss-of-function alleles in the TUBB4A gene can be estimated at \u223c1:706.In accordance with previous work, our data indicate that TUBB4A coding mutations do not play a critical role in the broad population of isolated dystonia patients.

     "abstract": "Recently, an additional study confirmed the association between SMPD1 mutations and Parkinson's disease (PD). While the first study on SMPD1 and PD suggested that only one SMPD1 mutations is responsible for the association to PD, the recent study argued that all SMPD1 mutations may be associated with an increased risk for PD. Since SMPD1 mutations are being routinely screened in some populations with high carrier frequencies, and since it will be further screened in additional PD populations, it is important to better define the association between SMPD1 and PD. We reanalyzed the data from the recent and previous papers, and we show that the association between SMPD1 and PD is indeed not driven by only one mutation, but it is also not driven by all SMPD1 mutations. In the Ashkenazi-Jewish population, the p.fs330P (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.03, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0026) and p.L302P (OR\u00a0=\u00a09.62, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) are associated with PD, and the p.R496L mutation is not (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.84, p\u00a0=\u00a00.71), and similar observation was noted in the Chinese population. Thus, we conclude that similar to the GBA gene where different mutations have differential effects, SMPD1 mutations also have a differential effects on the risk for PD.

     "abstract": "Several neurodegenerative diseases involve loss of catecholamine neurons\u2014Parkinson's disease (PD) is a prototypical example. Catecholamine neurons are rare in the nervous system, and why they are lost has been mysterious. Accumulating evidence supports the concept of \u201cautotoxicity\u201d\u2014inherent cytotoxicity caused by catecholamine metabolites. Since vesicular sequestration limits the buildup of toxic products of enzymatic and spontaneous oxidation of catecholamines, a vesicular storage defect could play a pathogenic role in the death of catecholaminergic neurons in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. In putamen, deficient vesicular storage is revealed in\u00a0vivo by accelerated loss of 18F-DOPA-derived radioactivity and post-mortem by decreased tissue dopamine (DA):DOPA ratios; in myocardium in\u00a0vivo by accelerated loss of 18F-dopamine-derived radioactivity and post-mortem by increased 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol:norepinephrine (DHPG:NE) ratios; and in sympathetic noradrenergic nerves overall in\u00a0vivo by increased plasma F-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (F-DOPAC):DHPG ratios. We retrospectively analyzed data from 20 conditions with decreased or intact catecholaminergic innervation, involving different etiologies, pathogenetic mechanisms, and lesion locations. All conditions involving parkinsonism had accelerated loss of putamen 18F-DOPA-derived radioactivity; in those with post-mortem data there were also decreased putamen DA:DOPA ratios. All conditions involving cardiac sympathetic denervation had accelerated loss of myocardial 18F-dopamine-derived radioactivity; in those with post-mortem data there were increased myocardial DHPG:NE ratios. All conditions involving localized loss of catecholaminergic innervation had evidence of decreased vesicular storage specifically in the denervated regions. Thus, across neurodegenerative diseases, loss of catecholaminergic neurons seems to be associated with decreased vesicular storage in the residual neurons.",

This document outlines best-practice recommendations for selecting appropriate candidates for apomorphine intermittent injection (the pen-injection formulation) or apomorphine continuous infusion (the pump formulation), for initiating patients onto therapy and for managing their ongoing treatment.Apomorphine is a suitable therapeutic option for PD patients who experience troublesome \u2018off\u2019 periods despite optimized treatment with oral PD medications. Due to its speed of onset, apomorphine injection is particularly suited to those patients requiring rapid, reliable relief of both unpredictable and predictable \u2018off\u2019 periods, those who require reliable and fast relief when anticipating an \u2018off\u2019, those with levodopa absorption or gastric emptying problems resulting in delayed or failed \u2018on\u2019, or for rapid relief of early morning dystonia or akinesia. Apomorphine infusion1 is suited for patients whose \u2018off\u2019 periods can no longer be adequately controlled by standard oral PD treatment or for those in whom rescue doses of apomorphine injection are effective but either needed too frequently (more than 4\u20136 times per day), or are associated with increasing dyskinesia. In addition to treating motor fluctuations, there is evidence that apomorphine infusion may be effective for the management of specific non-motor symptoms of PD associated with \u2018off\u2019 periods. Apomorphine infusion is less invasive than other non-oral treatment options for advancing disease, intrajejunal levodopa infusion and deep-brain stimulation.",

Studies were divided according to cohort size, method of assessment and whether comparison was made to an appropriate control group.Ninety-five articles were identified including reported clinical histories (n\u00a0=\u00a042), case reports and smaller case series (n\u00a0=\u00a012), larger case series (n\u00a0=\u00a023) and case-control cohorts (n\u00a0=\u00a018). Psychiatric symptoms were the most frequently investigated with anxiety, depression and Obsessive\u2013Compulsive disorder being most common. Cognitive impairment involved either global deficits or isolated difficulties in specific domains. Disturbances to sleep were most common in the dopa-responsive dystonias.

However, future studies should involve a complete assessment of all symptom subtypes in order to understand the frequency and gene-specificity of these symptoms.

Only a limited number of studies have explored the effectiveness of recruitment strategies and PD patient selection in clinical trials. We aim to review the four crucial recruitment components of RCTs (i.e. infrastructure, nature of the research, recruiter characteristics and participant characteristics) with particular implications in PD, and to explore strategies to improve recruitment and patient selection in RCTs in PD.Movement disorders centers have a key role in managing recruitment and patient selection in RCTs in PD. Key recommendations within the infrastructure component are to improve trust and communication between patient and participant, and to consider the diversity, perceived disadvantages, and health care accessibility of the participants. Further, study designs that involve participant's opinions and considers placebo and lessebo effects are highly recommended for the nature of the research component of RCTs. Finally, a team-based approach with recruiters and participants that establishes relationships between researchers and the community and addresses ethical considerations are encouraged as part of the recruiters and participants components.

We compared DLB and PDD patients by assessing structural and functional brain imaging and including PD patients.Patients with diagnosis of PD, PDD, DLB and a group of healthy controls for neuroimaging comparisons were recruited and changes in structural and resting-state functional MR (Regional Homogeneity, ReHo) were studied.No significant atrophy in VBM analysis was evident in PD. Conversely, PDD showed a significant bilateral frontal atrophy, whereas DLB was characterized by a predominant parietal, occipital atrophy; a similar involvement of subcortical regions in PDD and DLB was observed. ReHo demonstrated reduced local coherence of frontal regions in PD and in PDD, whereas DLB patients presented a reduced local connectivity in posterior regions.Different brain areas are specifically involved in PDD and DLB.

We studied the influence of depression on longitudinal motor and cognitive function among mild PD patients.A 1.5 years longitudinal study of 102 patients with mild idiopathic PD. Patients were assessed with a standardized clinical assessment battery including motor and non-motor scales. Patients also underwent serial neurocognitive testing that assessed global cognition, memory, attention, language, visuospatial and executive function.81 patients with mean age of 64.9(SD\u00a0=\u00a07.9) years and mean Hoehn & Yahr of 1.9(SD\u00a0=\u00a00.4) completed baseline and follow-up visits. 22 patients had clinically significant depression at baseline with mean Geriatric Depression Scale of 6.9(SD\u00a0=\u00a02.4). These patients presented with concomitant apathy and anxiety and were more likely to be females with longer duration of PD. At baseline, patients with depression had poorer performance on global cognition and all cognitive domains although not significantly different from patients without depression. At follow-up, there was no statistically significant difference on cognitive performance between those with and without baseline depression. Patients with baseline depression demonstrated worsening of motor function after 18 months (UPDRS Motor Score Change:\u00a0+5.0[7.0]vs.+0.2[7.3]; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015).

     "abstract": "Recent studies have suggested that the cerebellum may be involved in the pathophysiology of resting tremor in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of cerebellar continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) on cerebello-thalamo-cortical connectivity and resting tremor in PD patients.Thirteen PD patients and ten healthy subjects underwent two experimental sessions: (i) \u2018real\u2019 cTBS, delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere and (ii) \u2018sham\u2019 cerebellar cTBS, delivered over the neck muscles. The two sessions were performed at least one week apart. The effects of \u2018real\u2019 and \u2018sham\u2019 cerebellar cTBS were quantified as excitability changes in the contralateral primary motor cortex or as possible changes in resting tremor in the ipsilateral hand. Primary motor cortex excitability was assessed by recording the input/output curve of the motor-evoked potentials from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle.Resting tremor was rated clinically and objectively assessed by means of kinematic techniques. \u2018Real\u2019 cerebellar cTBS, though not \u2018sham\u2019 cerebellar cTBS, reduced the excitability in the contralateral primary motor cortex both in healthy subjects and in patients with PD. There was no significant change in rest tremor severity, as assessed by a clinical examination or kinematic techniques, after either \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018sham\u2019 cerebellar cTBS in patients. Lastly, there was no correlation between individual changes in M1 excitability and clinical or kinematic measures of resting tremor in patients.The cerebello-thalamo-cortical connectivity, as tested by cTBS, is not predominantly involved in the generation of resting tremor in PD.",

To rule out confounders, participants also underwent extensive psychological assessment including Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression.Patients with functional movement disorders did not differ from matched controls with respect to levels of circulating cortisol.We demonstrate that current stress levels are not altered in patients with functional movement disorders. Our results warrant careful review of current management of patients with functional neurological symptoms, and suggest that the insistence on heightened stress levels in these patients is unjustified.",

CMBs that are located in the deep or infratentorial regions and those that are present strictly in the lobar regions reflect hypertensive vasculopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, respectively. The development of CMBs can be accelerated by clinical factors. Orthostatic hypotension (OH) has been reported to be associated with cerebral small vessel disease, such as white matter lesions in Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the prevalence, location and risk factors, including OH, for CMBs in patients with PD.We conducted a retrospective chart review of consecutive patients with PD who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, Juntendo University School of Medicine between January 2010 and July 2014. One hundred and sixty-seven patients with PD who underwent gradient echo T2*-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were included in the present study. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the associations between risk factors and the presence of CMBs.CMBs were detected in 29 (17.4%) patients. Among the patients with CMBs, 19 (65.5%) had deep or infratentorial CMBs and 10 (34.5%) had strictly lobar CMBs. Hypertension, OH and a history of ischemic stroke were independently associated with deep or infratentorial CMBs, whereas antiplatelet use was independently associated with strictly lobar CMBs.In patients with PD, deep or infratentorial CMBs were more frequent than strictly lobar CMBs, and were associated with hypertension, OH and a history of ischemic stroke.",

We sought to describe the long-term (32-year) trends of incidence and mortality in PD patients hospitalized with aspiration pneumonia (AsPNA).Incidence and mortality of AsPNA in hospitalized PD versus non-PD patients was assessed by logistic regression analysis applied to a national database between the years 1979 and 2010. Covariates such as age-decennium, gender, year AsPNA occurred, and the interactions with PD diagnosis were investigated. Rate of AsPNA and mortality over the 32-years was trended and compared.AsPNA occurred in 3.6% of PD patients and 1.0% of non-PD patients. The average mortality for PD patients was less (17% vs. 22%). Long-term (32-year) trends revealed a nearly 10-fold increase in incidence of AsPNA in PD (0.4% in 1979, 4.9% in 2010), decreasing mortality overtime, higher likelihood in males, and increasing average age of AsPNA patients (steeper increase in PD). All p-values\u00a0<\u00a00.05. In regression analysis, each successive year had a slight increase in odds of AsPNA (OR 1.03 in PD, OR1.06 in non-PD).Trends over 32 years revealed a 10-fold increase in AsPNA among PD and non-PD patients, and an associated decrease in mortality. Our data suggest that PD patients are living longer, have slightly more AsPNA, but a lower mortality than was seen in past decades. Further research should investigate the causes of AsPNA in PD, and also potential interventions to decrease its occurrence.",

Some evidence is emerging that low levels of serum iron may increase PD risk. In this study we investigated whether PD patients have lower serum iron and ferritin than controls, and whether this is dependent on haptoglobin phenotype. We also investigated the effect of Hp phenotype as a modifier of the effect of smoking on PD risk.The study population consisted of 128 PD patients and 226 controls. Serum iron, ferritin, and haptoglobin phenotype were determined, and compared between PD cases and controls.Stratified analysis by haptoglobin phenotype was performed to determine effect of haptoglobin phenotype on serum iron parameter differences between PD cases and controls and to investigate its role in the protective effect of smoking on PD risk.PD cases had lower serum iron than controls (83.28 ug/100\u00a0ml vs 94.00 ug/100\u00a0ml, p 0.006), and in particular among subjects with phenotype 2-1. The protective effect of smoking on PD risk resulted stronger in subjects with phenotype 1-1 and 2-2, and weakest among subjects with phenotype 2-1. Ferritin levels were higher in PD cases than controls among subjects of White ethnicity.Our results report for the first time that the haptoglobin phenotype may be a contributor of iron levels abnormalities in PD patients. The mechanisms for these haptoglobin-phenotype specific effects will have to be further elucidated.",

Whether the two symptoms are related to each other is not known. The present study sought to investigate the prevalence and severity of fatigue and apathy in MS and PD, and the relationship between the two.The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) and the Apathy Scale (AS) were administered to 89 consecutive PD and 73 consecutive MS subjects.The mean FSS score for PD subjects was 4.46 and 5.01 for MS; the average total AS score for PD was 12.4 and 12.5 for MS. Using a cutoff of >4.0 on the FSS to assess fatigue, 64% of PD subjects and 74% of MS subjects suffered from severe fatigue. Using an AS cutoff score of >14.0 to determine apathy, 57% of PD subjects and 52% of MS subjects were apathetic. There was a significant correlation between FSS score and AS score in both disorders. FSS average scores and AS total scores were significantly correlated with motor severity in PD but not in MS. Duration of disease was not correlated with either scale scores in either disorder.Results confirm that AS and FSS are correlated with each other in both disorders and that MS subjects rate their fatigue significantly higher.",

Because of the lateralization of several cognitive and neuropsychiatric functions and the role of impaired dopaminergic transmission on non-motor symptoms in PD, the question raises whether body side of onset of parkinsonian motor symptoms might influence cognitive and/or neuropsychiatric domains in idiopathic PD.Here we investigated the prevalence and severity of neuropsychiatric and cognitive alterations in a cohort of 84 drug na\u00efve PD patients, divided into two groups according to the body side of onset of motor symptoms (42 left onset PD patients-LPD and 42 right onset PD patients-RPD). Eighty-four age-, sex- and educational level-matched healthy subjects (HC) served as controls.Both LPD and RPD patients had higher prevalence and severity of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms with respect to HC. There were no difference between LPD and RPD as to the pattern or severity of neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms. However, significantly higher percentage of LPD patients than RPD deviated more than 1.5 SD from mean values of HC at scales for depression.Our results indicate that in early PD patients side of onset of parkinsonian motor symptoms does not influence non-motor accompanying signs, at least at neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological domains, and suggest that differences reported by previous reports may be secondary to disease progression and/or dopamine replacement therapy.",

One important undertaking is ensuring that research participants give free and truly informed consent. This will necessitate adequate disclosure of risks and benefits at a time when these are incompletely defined; ensuring understanding of a complex research protocol when there is significant possibility of therapeutic misconception; and careful determination of capacity for informed consent in patients with a neurodegenerative disorder that is known to affect cognition.

     "abstract": "Recent experiments examining balance in Parkinson's disease (PD) have used the sensory organization test (SOT) to measure postural control and balance. Use of the SOT raises the question as to whether people will improve after undergoing the test multiple times or if there is a learning effect plateau after multiple trials. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a learning effect using the SOT in subjects with PD both fallers and non-fallers, and healthy controls.Nineteen subjects completed the study. Ten subjects with PD who were non-fallers (PD-Non-fallers), nine subjects with PD who were fallers (PD-Faller), and 10 healthy controls (Controls). Subjects completed 5 SOT testing sessions over a 3 week period. Those with PD were tested at the same time in their peak \u2018on\u2019 period.The PD-Faller groups SOT composite score improved from session 1 to session 4 and 5. In the Control group the composite score improved from session 1 to session 5. There was no change from session 1 to session 5 in the PD Non-faller group. The PD-Faller group had significantly lower composite scores than our PD Non-faller group and our Controls. Our PD-Non-faller group scores were similar to Controls.Multiple baseline measures are usually recommended for any task used as an outcome measure. Our findings suggest that in PD subjects who are considered fallers that by the fourth session any improvement may be due to a learning effect.",

     "abstract": "There has been a gradual shift in the definition of Parkinson's disease, from a movement disorder to a neurodegenerative condition affecting multiple cognitive domains. Mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is a frequent comorbidity in PD that is associated with progression to dementia (PDD) and debilitating consequences for patients and caregivers. At present, the pathophysiology underpinning cognitive impairment in PD is not established, although emerging evidence has suggested that multi-modal imaging biomarkers could be useful in the early diagnosis of PD-MCI and PDD, thereby identifying at-risk patients to enable treatment at the earliest stage possible. Structural MRI studies have revealed prominent grey matter atrophy and disruptions of white matter tracts in PDD, although findings in non-demented PD have been more variable. There is a need for further longitudinal studies to clarify the spatial and temporal progression of morphological changes in PD, as well as to assess their underlying involvement in the evolution of cognitive deficits. In this review, we discuss the aetiology and neuropsychological profiles of PD-MCI and PDD, summarize the putative imaging substrates in light of evidence from multi-modal neuroimaging studies, highlight limitations in the present literature, and suggest recommendations for future research.",

The assessments were performed before LCIG, 1, 3, 6 months after, and ever since, every 6 months.We studied 72 patients with a mean observation time of 22 months and a maximum of 48 months. During follow-up 28 patients discontinued the treatment, especially for lack of efficacy or adverse events related to the drug. We obtained a significant improvement of motor and non-motor fluctuations, mean off time and some non-motor symptoms. A significant increase in the percentage of time with dyskinesias was found in patients having less than 50% of the day with dyskinesias before LCIG. However, patients having already many dyskinesias before LCIG experienced a significant decrease of the troublesome dyskinesias, meaning that outcomes might be different depending on specific clinical characteristics. Adverse effects were in general minor but one case of intestinal perforation and one of abdominal cellulite were observed.We confirmed that LCIG is a very effective treatment option for advanced PD; however considering the findings that dyskinesia can increase and the potential for serious side effects, we suggest the necessity for development of guidelines that better define the profile of responders.",

Anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs), quantified by center of pressure (COP) displacement and speed prior to an initial heel off, and the maximum distance (COPCOM) between COP and center of mass (COM) during all three GI phases were calculated to evaluate dynamic postural control. Steady-state gait performance was also evaluated and compared across the groups.APAs in PSP were significantly altered such that the posterior COP shift is profoundly diminished when compared to PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, proper velocity control during GI in PSP was affected, particularly in the mediolateral direction, when compared to PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The diminished COPCOM distance is further indicative of more severe dynamic postural instability in PSP than in PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Significant differences in spatiotemporal parameters, inter-step variability, and asymmetry during gait in PSP, in comparison with PD were also identified (all p's\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The present study reveals that the compensatory GI strategy in PSP is distinct from PD and paradoxically induces lateral instability. Further, gait performance in PSP is slower and more variable which could be the consequence of lateral instability and fear of falling.",

High cognitive reserve capacity may protect cognition from \u03b2-amyloid and delay the onset of dementia. We tested the cognitive reserve theory in PD by determining whether educational attainment, a proxy for cognitive reserve, modifies the correlation between cortical \u03b2-amyloid accumulation and cognitive impairment.PD participants (N\u00a0=\u00a0155) underwent MRI to quantify brain volume and [11C] PiB PET imaging to quantify fibrillar \u03b2-amyloid deposition. Mean cortical binding potentials (MCBP) were calculated for each participant, with higher scores indicating more fibrillar \u03b2-amyloid. Global cognitive function was assessed using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to determine whether education modified the relationship between MCBP and cognitive function after controlling for brain volume.MCBP interacted with educational attainment to predict scores on each of the cognitive outcome measures (ps\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.02). Post-hoc analysis revealed that the effect of MCBP on cognitive function changed once the level of education reached 16 years. For participants with less than16 years of education (n\u00a0=\u00a068), higher MCBP correlated with worse cognitive function, with MCBP accounting for 8\u201330% of the variance in MMSE and CDR scores (ps\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.02). For participants with at least 16 years of education (n\u00a0=\u00a087), MCBP did not correlate with MMSE or CDR scores (R2s\u00a0<\u00a00.02, ps\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.17).These findings provide support for the cognitive reserve theory in PD and suggest that education may protect PD patients' cognition against cortical \u03b2-amyloid pathology.",

We ascertained a nationwide cohort of patients in order to study the genetic epidemiology of early-onset PD (EOPD) in Finland.By means of a search in a national database we ascertained all patients with EOPD. These patients had become eligible for reimbursement of PD drugs between the years 1995\u20132006 and were <55 years of age at the time of PD diagnosis. A total of 441 patients consented and provided clinical and genealogical information.The incidence of EOPD increased 1.7-fold between the years 1995\u20132006, the mean annual incidence being 3.3/100,000. Fifty-two patients (11.8%) reported an affected first-degree relative. The birthplaces of patients with PD among first-degree relatives were clustered in certain regions in the southwestern and western coastal provinces of Finland and in the eastern province of Savo. Furthermore, the distance between the birthplaces of the patients' parents was smaller for patients, who had first-degree relatives with PD than for patients with no family history of PD.Our data suggest that the incidence of EOPD is increasing. The birthplaces of patients with PD among first-degree relatives were clustered in certain provinces of Finland suggesting that monogenic forms of PD or genetic susceptibility of PD are present in the population.",

The increased inhibitory tone of GPi neurons and the subsequent thalamic inhibition could be one of the key mechanisms of GPi deep brain stimulation in dystonia.

Several issues may physically impede execution of MRI. Moreover, the severity of motor or non-motor symptoms of PD might reduce compliance to MRI. Here we investigated predictors affecting compliance to MRI in PD patients.Two-hundred-thirty-six PD patients underwent clinical, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric investigations. Accordingly to their ability/inability to perform MRI scan, they were divided into 3 groups. Forty-two patients had physical incompatibility to MRI (PI); 51 patients refused to undergo scan during the MRI evaluation session (RR); 143 patients accepted to undergo and successfully completed MRI (SP). Multivariate/Univariate Analyses of Variance, followed by Bonferroni's post-hoc comparisons, were used to assess differences among groups. To identify predictors of compliance to MRI scan in the whole PD sample (SP vs. RR\u00a0+\u00a0PI) we carried out a logistic regression analysis.PI subjects were significantly older, had higher UPRDRS-III score, received lower daily dopamine agonist doses, and displayed worse cognitive performances than SP. RR subjects had significantly higher anxiety severity than SP. Lower daily dopamine agonist equivalents and higher anxiety scores were the significant whole predictors of not compliance to MRI in the logistic regression analysis.These results show that demographic, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric features may limit compliance to MRI in PD, and provide valuable aid for setting and interpreting research and clinical MRI studies in PD.",

The clinical data were obtained through detailed review of medical records.Within few days after DAs withdrawal, all 4 patients developed apathy, anhedonia and depression, despite the marked reduction of dyskinesias and the improvement of motor fluctuations after LCIG introduction. We unsuccessfully tried to manage these and other DAWS symptoms by increasing LCIG flow. Within 6 months, all patients spontaneously presented a slow but gradual improvement of DAWS symptoms, not requiring any further treatment strategy or LCIG discontinuation.To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the occurrence of DAWS symptoms in advanced PD patients after DAs withdrawal in LCIG and highlighting the difficulty of distinguishing postoperative effects from drug withdrawal symptoms. Therefore we wish to draw attention of clinicians to the risk of developing DAWS in advanced PD patients switched to LCIG monotherapy. In such cases, a rapid taper of DAs should be avoided.",

Then, the two groups clinical outcomes were compared after more than 8 years of follow-up by means of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, reporting the overall disability experienced by patients during the entire observational period.Subjects receiving an earlier STN-DBS showed a sustained improvement in the activities of daily living and motor complications, never reaching the severe levels of disability reported by Late-Stimulated patients at the time of surgical selection. After \u22658 years of follow-up the Early-Stimulated group still reported a 28.7% lower impairment in activities of daily living and 43.8% lower duration of waking day spent in OFF compared to their pre-surgical basal scores.Although the limitation of a retrospective study design should be considered in the interpretation of data, our findings suggest that an earlier STN-DBS treatment might result in a more precocious stabilization of motor complications, with beneficial effects on the patient's social and professional life autonomy.",

In this study, we report clinical and genetic findings in a new Italian family with SNCA triplication.The patients' phenotype was assessed by neurological examination, neuropsychological tests, and brain imaging (MRI and SPECT-DaTSCAN). For the genetic investigation, we used three independent techniques: genome-wide SNP microarrays, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).Genetic studies documented the presence of four copies of the SNCA gene in the affected family members. FISH experiments and the segregation in the family were consistent with a heterozygous triplication of the SNCA locus. The patients carrying the SNCA triplication developed early-onset parkinsonism combined with depression, behavior disturbances, sleep disorders, and cognitive decline; marked autonomic dysfunctions were not observed. Brain imaging revealed fronto-parietal atrophy and a severe striatal dopaminergic deficit.The identification of this novel family contributes to the genetic and clinical characterization of this rare form. Our data reinforce the view that SNCA triplications cause early-onset parkinsonism, with prominent non-motor features.",

Subjects underwent a routine audiological evaluation and otoacoustic emission recordings. The patients were then slowly-titrated to a stable dose of 100\u00a0mg levodopa four times in a day. A post-treatment assessment was made in order to detect significant changes in audiological responses. Finally, possible associations between clinical data and hearing results were also evaluated.At pure-tone audiometry, higher auditory threshold levels were observed in PD when compared to the controls. Moreover, DPOAE responses in PD patients were found low at almost all tested frequencies, suggesting subclinical cochlear damage. Interestingly, after dopaminergic treatment, a significant increase in DPOAE responses was detected. Notably, DPOAE dysfunction correlated with clinical severity, whereas high hearing thresholds appeared positively related with more prolonged disease duration.Our findings demonstrate that otoacoustic emission recording and pure-tone audiometry reveal levodopa-sensitive cochlear dysfunction and hearing loss in PD. A parallel improvement in subjective motor symptoms and DPOAE objective responses could help clinicians in monitoring therapeutic responses and dynamic changes during the course of the disease.",

Demographics, medications, Dementia Rating Scale-2, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire (NPI-Q) ratings were obtained. Apathy was defined as an NPI-Q apathy score \u22651.

Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the effects of baseline apathy on dementia development while controlling for other clinical and demographic factors.Of 132 PD patients 12.1% (N\u00a0=\u00a016) scored in the apathetic range at baseline. A total of 19.6% (N\u00a0=\u00a026) individuals developed dementia over the course of the study, 8 of whom (30.8% of future dementia patients) had baseline apathy.

Recent PD research has focused primarily on etiology rather than clinical progression and long-term outcomes. For the PD patient, caregivers, and clinicians, information on expected clinical progression and long-term outcomes is of great importance. Today, it remains largely unknown what factors influence long-term clinical progression and outcomes in PD; recent data indicate that the factors that increase the risk to develop PD differ, at least partly, from those that accelerate clinical progression and lead to worse outcomes. Prospective studies will be required to identify factors that influence progression and outcome. We suggest that data for such studies is collected during routine office visits in order to guarantee high external validity of such research. We report here the results of a consensus meeting of international movement disorder experts from the Genetic Epidemiology of Parkinson's Disease (GEO-PD) consortium, who convened to define which long-term outcomes are of interest to patients, caregivers and clinicians, and what is presently known about environmental or genetic factors influencing clinical progression or long-term outcomes in PD. We propose a panel of rating scales that collects a significant amount of phenotypic information, can be performed in the routine office visit and allows international standardization. Research into the progression and long-term outcomes of PD aims at providing individual prognostic information early, adapting treatment choices, and taking specific measures to provide care optimized to the individual patient's needs.",

Visual hallucinations (VH) are the most common manifestation of psychosis in PD. The exact pathogenesis of VH in patients with PD is not clearly understood. Presence of VH has been described to be associated with rapid cognitive decline and increased nursing home placements in PD patients. A large number of structural and functional neuroimaging studies have been conducted to understand the cerebral basis of VH in PD. Structural imaging studies (Voxel Based Morphometry) have reported grey matter atrophy in multiple regions of the brain such as primary visual cortex, visual association cortex, limbic regions, cholinergic structures such as pedunculopontine nucleus and substantia innominata, which conclude possible alterations of brain regions associated with functions such as visuospatial-perception, attention control and memory. Most functional neuroimaging studies (functional MRI, positron emission tomography and single photon emission computerized tomography) have reported altered activation, blood flow, or reduced metabolism in both dorsal and ventral visual pathways, which probably indicates an alteration in the normal bottom-top visual processing and the presence of an aberrant top-down visual processing.

PIGD symptoms were measured using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part III, Motor Examination subscale. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between cognition and PIGD symptoms with models adjusting for age, sex, education, enrollment site, disease duration, and motor symptom severity.The analysis included 783 participants, with mean (standard deviation) age of 67.3 (9.7) years and median (interquartile range) MDS-UPDRS Motor Subscale score of 26 (17, 35). Deficits in global cognition, executive function, memory, and phonemic fluency were associated with more severe PIGD symptoms. Deficits in executive function were associated with impairments in gait, freezing, and postural stability, while visuospatial impairments were associated only with more severe freezing, and poorer memory function was associated only with greater postural instability.While impairments in global cognition and aspects of executive functioning were associated with more severe PIGD symptoms, specific cognitive domains were differentially related to distinct PIGD components, suggesting the presence of multiple neural pathways contributing to associations between cognition and PIGD symptoms in persons with PD.",

Here we aim to study whether STN DBS can affect moral decision-making in PD patients.Eleven patients with PD and bilateral STN DBS implant performed a computerized moral task in ON and OFF stimulation conditions. A control group of PD patients without DBS implant performed the same experimental protocol. All patients underwent motor, cognitive and psychological assessments.STN stimulation was not able to modify neither reaction times nor responses to moral task both when we compared the ON and the OFF state in the same patient (reaction times, p\u00a0=\u00a0.416) and when we compared DBS patients with those treated only with the best medical treatment (reaction times: p\u00a0=\u00a0.408, responses: p\u00a0=\u00a0.776).Moral judgment is the result of a complex process, requiring cognitive executive functions, problem-solving, anticipations of consequences of an action, conflict processing, emotional evaluation of context and of possible outcomes, and involving different brain areas and neural circuits. Our data show that STN DBS leaves unaffected moral decisions thus implying relevant clinical and ethical implications for DBS consequences on patients' behavior, on decision-making and on judgment ability. In conclusion, the technique can be considered safe on moral behavior.",

     "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the presence of autonomic nervous system dysfunction in PARK2 mutation carriers.We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 8 PARK2 carriers (age: 60.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.8 years) and 13 individuals with idiopathic PD (iPD) (age: 59.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.9 years). Autonomic dysfunction was measured using the SCOPA-AUT questionnaire, non-invasive autonomic tests and responses of noradrenaline and vasopressin levels to postural changes. Myocardial sympathetic denervation was assessed with metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy. This damage was further investigated in postmortem epicardial tissue of one PARK2 carrier and three control cases (two PD patients and one subject without PD).The prevalence of autonomic symptoms and orthostatic hypotension (OH) was lower in PARK2 mutation carriers than in iPD patients (SCOPA OUT: 3.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8 vs. 14.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; OH: present in three iPD patients but none of the PARK2 mutation carriers). Second, sympathetic myocardial denervation was less severe in PARK2 mutation carriers compared to controls, both in MIBG scintigraphy (late H/M uptake ratio: 1.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.35 vs. 1.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25 p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and in postmortem tissue study. Interestingly, axonal alpha-synuclein deposits were absent in epicardial tissue of the PARK2 mutation carrier while they were present in the two PD patients.Our study supports the view that autonomic nervous system dysfunction and myocardial sympathetic denervation are less pronounced in PARK2 mutation carriers than in individuals with iPD, suggesting that the involvement of small peripheral sympathetic nerve fibers is a minor pathological hallmark in PARK2 carriers.",

Traditional orthostatic blood pressures are normal in some patients with lightheadedness and other measures of cardiovascular dysautonomia can be insensitive. In this study, we used continuous non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring to measure beat-to-beat changes in blood pressure and heart rate on standing and during Valsalva as a potential marker of autonomic dysfunction.Subjects had a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with or without documented orthostatic hypotension. Each participant underwent traditional measurement of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate as well as measurement of beat-to-beat blood pressure and heart rate using continuous non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring during Valsalva maneuver and in response to standing. Orthostatic change in blood pressure and heart rate, and frequencies of normal and abnormal blood pressure responses to Valsalva maneuver were analyzed.In subjects without documented orthostatic hypotension, there was a higher proportion of abnormal blood pressure responses to Valsalva in subjects with symptoms of lightheadedness or dizziness upon standing compared to those without symptoms (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Additionally, the proportion of abnormal blood pressure responses during Valsalva observed in symptomatic subjects without orthostatic hypotension was indistinguishable from those with documented orthostatic hypotension (p\u00a0=\u00a00.7).Our findings suggest that continuous non-invasive arterial pressure monitoring may be more sensitive than traditional measurement of orthostatic blood pressure to detect subtle cardiac dysautonomia in Parkinson's disease and helpful in the diagnosis of unexplained lightheadedness.",

Curiously, tremor-related quality of life has never been directly compared in patients with the two major tremor disorders, essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD). We performed a head-to-head comparison of ET with PD patients.The Quality of Life in Essential Tremor (QUEST) questionnaire was administered to 103\u00a0ET and 103 matched PD patients enrolled in a clinical-epidemiological study in New York.The QUEST total score and QUEST physical subscore were higher in ET than PD patients (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In relative terms, ET patients reported significantly more impairment than PD patients in multiple areas; PD patients reported more impairment than ET patients in one area (all p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.02). In absolute terms, tremor impacted on many aspects of quality of life in both diseases, including physical and psychosocial, and in one-third or more of PD patients, tremor sometimes, frequently or always interfered with numerous physical activities, including writing, using a typewriter/computer, fixing small things, dressing, eating, and holding reading material.Tremor is a clinical entity that can have numerous effects on patients. While there were relative differences between the two major tremor disorders, ET and PD, in absolute terms, tremor impacted on several domains of quality of life, from physical to psychosocial, in a large proportion of ET and PD patients. Attempts to judge the efficacy of treatments for tremor, whether pharmacological or surgical, should consider its broad impact.",

The primary outcome measure was the velocity of CoP displacement (VEL_MED_AP/ML) assessed by static stabilometry in eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC) conditions. The secondary outcomes were other stabilometric parameters, the Sensory Organization Balance Test (SOT), and gait analysis (GA).There were no significant differences in demographic and clinical data and Berg Balance Scale scores between the groups. There was a significant main effect in the VEL_MED_AP/ML between the groups and eye conditions (p\u00a0=\u00a0.016). A significant main effect was found in the EO (p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) and EC (p\u00a0=\u00a0.04) conditions. Post-hoc comparisons showed a significant increase in VEL_CoP in both the EO and EC conditions only in the patients with PD and PS. No significant main effects on SOT and GA were found.Patients with PD and PS had more difficulty achieving good postural alignment with gravity and greater velocity of body sway than the other groups. Rehabilitation programs for patients with PD and PS should include spine alignment and dynamic postural training.",

In an open-label, 54-week study, LCIG was initiated as daytime monotherapy via nasojejunal (NJ) tube then switched to percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J) tube; adjunctive therapy was permitted 28 days postPEG-J. In a 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, double-dummy trial, patients continued stable doses of existing anti-PD medications, but LCIG replaced daytime oral levodopa-carbidopa and was initiated directly via PEG-J.In the open-label study, 92% of 354 patients received monotherapy at post\u2013PEG-J week 4; mean titration duration was 7.6 days; dosing remained stable post-titration (mean total daily dose [TDD] was 1572\u00a0mg at last visit). In the double-blind trial, 84% received polypharmacy; mean titration took 7.1 days for the LCIG arm (TDD post-titration: 1181\u00a0mg; n\u00a0=\u00a037). At post\u2013PEG-J week 4, mean \u201coff\u201d time with LCIG was reduced by 3.9\u00a0h (open-label/monotherapy study) and 3.7\u00a0h (double-blind/polypharmacy trial). NJ treatment (open-label study only) required an additional procedure with related adverse events (AEs) and withdrawals. The most common AEs during PEG-J weeks 1\u20134 in the open-label/monotherapy and double-blind/polypharmacy trials, respectively, were complication of device insertion (35%, 57%) and abdominal pain (26%, 51%). Discontinuations due to nonprocedure/nondevice AEs were low (2.2%, 2.7%).These results support the option of initiating LCIG with or without NJ and as either monotherapy or polypharmacy.",

The aim of this study was to determine whether HRV can be employed in order to differentiate between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD).We examined HRV in 30 probable DLB patients (16 men and 14 women; mean age, 79.9 years; SD, 4.7 years), and 30 probable AD patients (15 men and 15 women; mean age, 79.8 years; SD, 5.6 years), compared with that in 20 age- and sex-matched controls. Subjects with other causes of impaired HRV were excluded. HRV was determined using the RR intervals of a 5-min electrocardiogram recording. Measurements of beat-to-beat RR variability, including time domains [(RR-standard deviation (SDNN), percentage of consecutive RR intervals differing by more than 50 msec (pNN50), and root mean square difference of successive RR intervals (RMSSD)), and frequency domains [very low- (VLF), low- (LF), and high-frequency (HF) components, and total spectral power (Total power)], were assessed retrospectively. The association between these HRV parameters and cardiac iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) scintigraphy were investigated in 22 probable DLB patients.DLB group showed significant decreases compared to AD group in almost all HRV parameters including SDNN, pNN50, RMSSD, VLF, LF, HF, and Total power. Among these, SDNN, VLF, and Total power were correlated with the 123I-MIBG delayed heart to mediastinum ratio.Impaired HRV was detected in patients with probable DLB. Non-invasive and routine electrocardiogram may have potential in differentiating DLB from AD.",

However, the exact pathophysiology of this phenomenon remains obscure.Surface electromyography (sEMG) was recorded in 11 PD patients with upper camptocormia, 11 PD patients with lower camptocormia, and 10 age-matched PD patients without postural deformity. Electrodes were positioned above the external oblique, hip flexors and paraspinal muscles at Th11 level bilaterally. Recording commenced with the patient in supine position on a tilt table, and continued when the table was tilted up to vertical position. Lidocaine was injected into the external oblique in patients with upper camptocormia and the psoas major in patients with lower camptocormia.All patients with upper and lower camptocormia developed the corresponding camptocormic posture during tilt up. The onset of camptocormic posture was preceded by the appearance of sEMG activity in the external oblique in 10 out of 11 patients with upper camptocormia, but less frequently in patients with lower camptocormia and the controls. Hip flexors sEMG activity was recorded in almost all patients. Posture was improved in 8 out of 9 patients with upper camptocormia, and 9 out of 11 patients with lower camptocormia following injections of lidocaine.The results suggest the external oblique is involved, at least in part, in the development of upper camptocormia. Although EMG findings cannot differentiate pathogenicity, the psoas major is probably involved in lower camptocormia.",

OB & T areas on 1-mm-thick coronal images were measured and summed for volumes. We examined relationships between olfactory function and volume, and cardiovascular dysautonomia. We defined the cut-off values for OSIT-J score or MIBG uptake and OB & T volume to discriminate PD from PD-related disorders and calculated the proportional rate of PD in four categorized groups.OB & T volume was smaller in PD than in MSA or PSP/CBD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 each).

The rate of probable PD gradually increased as OSIT-J score and OB & T volume decreased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Although preliminary, these data obtained from a combined morphological and functional evaluation of OB or cardiovascular dysautonomia could be useful for further differential of PD and other PD-related disorders.",

An index for such anticipation is provided by the \u2018flash-lag illusion' in which moving objects are perceived ahead of static objects while actually being in the same place. We investigated the neurophysiological relation between visuomotor anticipation and motor velocity in Parkinson's disease (PD) and controls.Motor velocity was assessed by the number of keystrokes in 30s (\u2018kinesia score\u2019) and visuomotor anticipation in a behavioural flash-lag paradigm while electroencephalography data was obtained. PD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a024) were divided in a \u2018PDslow\u2019 and a \u2018PDfast\u2019 group based on kinesia score.The PDslow group had a lower kinesia score than controls (resp. 40.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7 and 64.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Eight patients underwent a further real cTBS session in ON condition. STDT was measured on both hands before, 5 and 25\u00a0min after real and sham cTBS delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the more affected side. We controlled the efficacy of our protocol by monitoring primary motor cortex (M1) excitability. Ten healthy subjects acted as control group.STDT values were increased in PD patients in the OFF condition compared with healthy subjects and PD patients in the ON condition. In PD patients OFF condition, real but not sham cerebellar cTBS, significantly reduced STDT values only in the hand ipsilateral to the stimulated cerebellar hemisphere. Cerebellar cTBS also decreased motor evoked potentials (MEP) size in the contralateral M1. When PD patients were tested in the ON condition, cerebellar cTBS failed to modify STDT values.cerebellar cTBS improved STDT values in PD patients exclusively in OFF condition. We hypothesize that cerebellar stimulation partially compensates for increased STDT values only when patients are OFF dopaminergic therapy. This suggests that the cerebellum may act as compensatory system in PD.",

Recent findings showed that CI can be associated with frontal/executive dysfunctions, likely determining a failure in high-level monitoring of attention-action circuits. CI has been often observed in demented patients, but scarce data are available about CI in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, we detected occurrence of CI and investigated the cognitive processes associated to this phenomenon in a large sample of non-demented PD patients.We retrospectively analysed graphic reproductions in a copying task of 100 non-demented PD patients who had also completed cognitive, behavioural, and motor screening assessment.CI phenomenon occurred in 50/100 non-demented PD patients (50%; 118/700 drawings). Among these patients, 46/50 patients copied drawings close to the model (near-CI), 2/50 patients superimposed their copy directly on the model (adherent-CI), whereas 2/50 patients showed both near-and adherent-CI. MANOVA showed that non-demented PD patients with CI showed more severe impairment on frontal/executive functions and visuo-constructional abilities than non-demented PD patients without CI. However, the logistic regression model revealed that occurrence of CI was significantly associated to lower scores on frontal/executive tasks only.CI can be found in a large proportion of non-demented PD patients, and it is related to frontal monitoring defects that could hamper inhibition of action and attention toward a model.",

However, stimulation induced side effects such as bradykinesia have also been reported recently. The influence of stimulation parameters on such side effects have not yet been systemically assessed in these patients.Here we tested the effect of stimulation frequency and duration of stimulation period on hand motor function in 22 patients with primary cervical and segmental dystonia using an unimanual tapping task. Patients performed the task at 4 different stimulation frequencies (0\u00a0Hz\u00a0=\u00a0OFF stimulation, 20, 50 and \u2265130\u00a0Hz\u00a0=\u00a0high frequency stimulation) after either an SHORT (5\u00a0min, N\u00a0=\u00a016) or a LONG (60\u00a0min, N\u00a0=\u00a06) stimulation period (i.e. changing of DBS-frequency). The change of overall mobility under HFS compared to the preoperative state was assessed with a 5-point Likert-scale. Tapping performance was analysed using a repeated measures ANOVA with the main factor \u2018FREQUENCY\u2019. Tapping performance at HFS and changes in general mobility were correlated using Spearman's Rho.We found a frequency specific modulation of hand motor function: HFS led to deterioration and 20\u00a0Hz stimulation to improvement of tapping rate. The effects were predominant in the \u2018LONG\u2019 group suggesting a significant contribution of stimulation duration.This is important to consider during DBS-programming and evaluation of potential side effects. Furthermore, the impairment in hand motor function under HFS was mirrored by the patients' observation of a deterioration of general mobility.",

     "abstract": "Rapid head movements associated with a change in fixation (head saccades) have been reported to be slow in cervical dystonia (CD). Such slowing is typically measured as an increase in time to complete a movement. The mechanisms responsible for this slowing are poorly understood.We measured head saccades in 11 CD patients and 11 healthy subjects using a magnetic search coil technique.Head saccades in CD took longer to reach a desired target location. This longer duration was due to multiple pauses in the trajectory of the head movement. The head velocity of each segment of the (interrupted) head movement was appropriate for the desired total movement amplitude. The head velocity was, however, higher for the amplitude of the individual interrupted movements. These results suggest that brain programs the proper head movement amplitude, but the movement is interrupted by pathological pauses.Voluntary head saccades have a longer duration in CD due to frequent pauses. The frequent pauses reflect pathological interruptions of normally programmed intended head movement.",

In PD evidence has accrued for a vesicular storage defect and decreased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity in residual dopaminergic terminals, resulting in accumulation of the toxic dopamine (DA) metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL). In this study we asked whether MSA entails a similar abnormal neurochemical pattern.DA and its main neuronal metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), norepinephrine (NE) and its main neuronal metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DHPG), the catecholamine precursor DOPA, and DOPAL were measured in striatal and frontal cortical tissue from patients with pathologically proven end-stage MSA (N\u00a0=\u00a015), sporadic PD (N\u00a0=\u00a017), and control subjects (N\u00a0=\u00a018).Compared to the control group, the MSA and PD groups had similarly decreased putamen DA (by 96% and 93%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), DOPAC (97% and 95%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), NE (91% and 74%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and DHPG (81% and 74%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

The association between genotype, PD risk and phenotype was tested using multivariate regression models.None of the tested SNPs was significantly associated with PD risk, neither in any individual cohort nor in the combined analysis after correction for multiple comparisons. The MAP2K5/SKOR1 marker rs12593813 was associated with higher frequency of tremor in the Tel-Aviv cohort (61.0% vs. 46.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, dominant model). However, the risk allele for tremor in this gene has been associated with reduced RLS risk. Moreover, this association did not replicate in Tremor-dominant PD patients from New-York.RLS genetic risk markers are not associated with increased PD risk or subtype in the current study.

Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes or saliva, and the mutational screening was performed by quantitative and qualitative real-time PCR.The only alteration identified was the p.E46K mutation in a 60-year-old man, born in Bolivia, with a familial history of autosomal dominant Parkinson's disease. This is the second family ever reported, in which this rare pathogenic mutation is segregating. The same mutation was firstly described ten years ago in a Spanish family with a neurodegenerative syndrome combining parkinsonism, dementia and visual hallucinations.

Combined GPi\u2013GPe DBS allowed maintained improvement but without dyskinesia. Follow up of patients over the subsequent 6\u201312 weeks showed gradual loss of this initial improvement. Switching back to GPi-DBS alone provided greater improvement in off medication symptoms than had been observed using the same GPi-DBS setting, 6\u201312 weeks previously.Benefits on the off-medication symptoms of PD obtained acutely with GPe-DBS are in general not sustained. Similarly, the effects of GPi-DBS on the off medication symptoms of PD, can evolve over short periods of time presumably as a result of changes in network-wide neuronal plasticity.

The regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose was measured using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the PD patients.PD patients without dementia produced a greater number of pareidolic illusions compared with the controls. Pareidolia was observed in all of the patients having visual hallucinations as well as a subset of those without visual hallucinations.

The index of visual hallucinations was correlated with hypometabolism in the left parietal cortex. A region associated with both pareidolia and visual hallucinations was found in the left parietal lobe.Our study suggests that PD patients without dementia experience pareidolia more frequently than healthy controls and that posterior cortical dysfunction could be a common neural mechanism of pareidolia and visual hallucinations.

EXP group also showed significantly greater increase in the gait speed than CON group at FU6m (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The positive findings of this study provide evidence that this multi-dimensional balance training programme can enhance balance and dual-task gait performance up to 12-month follow-up in people with PD.",

Aside from its associated motor features, the disease affects cognition in some patients, mood, and morale, and has been associated with increased risk of mortality in the elderly. Studies have not investigated the relationship between self-rated health and risk of ET. We determined whether baseline poor self-rated health was associated with increased risk of incident ET.In this prospective, population-based study of people \u226565 years of age, subjects were evaluated at baseline and 3 years later. At baseline, subjects were asked to rate their health using a single-item health question. Hazard ratios (HR) of ET according to baseline self-rated health (very good, good, fair, poor, and very poor) were estimated with Cox models.The 3853 subjects had a median follow-up duration of 3.2 years. There were 82 incident ET cases. Compared to subjects who rated their health as good or very good, the risk of ET was increased for subjects who rated their health as fair (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.69, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and for subjects who rated their health as poor or very poor (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.12, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In a fully adjusted model, the risk remained increased for subjects who rated their health as poor or very poor (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).Subjects rating their health as poor/very poor at baseline were at increased risk of incident ET at follow-up. Premotor and/or early motor symptoms of ET could negatively influence self-perceptions of health status.",

The main goal of this study was to assess the impact of NPS, assessed by means of a new specific scale, on caregiver burden.A sample of 584 pairs of PD patients and their primary caregivers was studied. Patients' NPS were measured with the Scale for Evaluation of Neuropsychiatric Disorders in PD (SEND-PD), and the Zarit Caregiver Burden Inventory was used to quantify caregiver burden. Three linear regression models were built to check factors associated with caregiver burden, one for the total sample and two for subgroups stratified by the presence of dementia.The most frequent NPS were depression (in 66% of the sample), anxiety (65%) and mental fatigue (57%). Patients with dementia (n\u00a0=\u00a094; 16% of sample) consistently presented more NPS than patients without dementia (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). On linear regression models, the main determinants of caregiver burden (for the total sample and the sample of patients without dementia) were SEND-PD dimensions mood/apathy and psychosis, PD-related disability and disease duration. For patients with dementia, the only significant caregiver burden determinants were SEND-PD psychosis and mood/apathy subscale scores.NPS in PD are highly associated with and are determinants of caregiver burden, and are more prevalent and burdensome in patients with dementia. Detailed assessment and specific interventions aimed at NPS could alleviate caregiver burden.",

Patients were assessed with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr scale, 8-item Parkinson's disease Questionnaire, Mini-Mental State Examination.Data from 593 patients were analyzed, 325 (54.3%) were freezers of whom 200 (61.6%) experienced FOG only during off state (off-freezers), 6 (1.8%) only during on state and 119 (36.6%) either in on and off states or independently of dopaminergic response-related symptoms (onoff-freezers). Overall, freezers vs non-freezers had longer disease duration, more advanced disease and greater disability. Moreover, freezers more frequently reported wearing-off and experienced worse quality of life. Onoff-freezers vs off-freezers were older, more severely disabled, less likely to experience wearing-off, treated with lower levodopa equivalent daily dose and with poorer cognitive performance.Self-reported FOG is mainly recognizable in advanced PD and is associated with more disability and worse quality of life.

Given that the underlying mechanisms of cognitive decline or dementia associated with PD remain unclear, there is currently no mechanism-based treatment available. Identification of biological markers, including neuroimaging, biofluids and common genetic variants, that account for the heterogeneity of PD related cognitive decline could provide important insights into the pathological processes that underlie cognitive impairment in PD. These combined biomarker approaches will enable early diagnosis and provide indicators of cognitive progression in PD patients.

Patients with Parkinson's disease or Parkinson's disease dementia and aged over 35 years were compared to all other admissions, excluding the above, with the same age criteria. We examined reasons for admissions (ICD-10), length of stay and in-hospital mortality. We used indirect standardisation and Poisson modelling to derive proportional ratios adjusting for age group and sex.There were 324,055 Parkinson's disease admissions in 182,859 patients over 4 years which included 232,905 non-elective admissions (72%). This resulted in expenditure of \u00a3907 million (\u00a3777 million for non-elective admissions). The main reasons for admission were pneumonia (13.5%), motor decline (9.4%), urinary tract infection (9.2%), and hip fractures (4.3%). These conditions occurred 1.5 to 2.6 times more frequently in patients than controls. Patients with Parkinson's disease were almost twice as likely to stay in hospital for more than 3 months (ratio 1.90, 95% CI 1.83, 1.97) and even more likely die in hospital (ratio 2.46, 95% CI 2.42, 2.49).Parkinson's disease patients in England have higher rates of emergency admissions with longer hospital stays, higher costs and in-hospital mortality.

This suggests that the dysfunction in the nigrostriatal motor circuit may be lateralized. The present study examined whether the asymmetric motor presentation is associated with hemisphere-specific cognitive decline and lateralized gray matter volume loss.Data from comprehensive cognitive tests that measured visuospatial and verbal functions and high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of the brain were acquired in 23 PD subjects with left-side motor symptom onset (PDL), 23 PD subjects with right-side onset (PDR), and 23 matched Controls. GM volume differences were assessed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Cognitive results and VBM were compared among the three groups, and correlation analyses were performed between those cognitive domains and brain areas that showed significant differences.PDL subjects had lower performance on visuospatial memory tasks compared to PDR. Furthermore, PDL subjects experienced lateralized GM loss, which was localized predominantly in the right hemisphere contralateral to the side of motor symptom onset. Visuospatial memory performance in PDL was correlated with GM loss in the right middle frontal gyrus and precuneus.These data suggest that the onset of asymmetric motor symptoms in PD may be associated with hemisphere-specific memory decline and lateralized GM loss, particularly in PDL. This study underscores the importance of classifying PD subgroups based on the side of motor symptom onset for clinical care and research to optimize cognitive outcomes.",

We investigated dopaminergic denervation in the striatum in PD patients according to COMT rs4680 genotype.Patients with idiopathic PD were assessed for motor severity (UPDRS-III rating scale in OFF-state), dopaminergic denervation using [123I]-FP-CIT SPECT imaging, and genotyped for the COMT rs4680 enzyme. [123I]-FP-CIT binding potential (BP) for each voxel was defined by the ratio of tracer-binding in the region of interest (striatum, caudate nucleus and putamen) to that in a region of non-specific activity. Genotyping was performed using TaqMan\u00ae SNP genotyping assay. We used a regression model to evaluate the effect of COMT genotype on the BP in the striatum and its sub-regions.Genotype distribution was: 11 (27.5%) COMTHH, 26 (65%) COMTHL and 3 (7.5%) COMTLL.

Cardiovascular reflexes indices were significantly more affected in MSA-P compared to PD and controls. EB presented a 91% sensitivity and 94% specificity in the differentiation of MSA-P and PD. HUTT\u00a0+\u00a0VM presented a 91% sensitivity and 92% specificity.Our results suggest that EB or HUTT\u00a0+\u00a0VM performed with an integrated instrumental approach and analyzed with the discriminant procedure may distinguish MSA-P from PD at an early stage and might improve the accuracy of current diagnostic criteria. However, a validation in separate samples and prospective studies is needed.",

Therefore, the present study aims to examine both GM and WM volumes of cognitively asymptomatic PD patients with a longitudinal design.A total of 42 cognitively asymptomatic patients with early stage PD were recruited and followed up for 1.5 years. At follow-up, 12 patients progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and were classified as \u201cconverters\u201d while the remaining 30 patients remained cognitively asymptomatic and were classified as \u201cnon-converters\u201d. All patients underwent clinical and neuropsychological assessments as well as MRI scans at baseline and at follow-up.At baseline, non-converters and converters had comparable cognitive scores. At follow-up, converters showed more deficits in frontal-related cognitive function than non-converters. Volumetric analyses revealed that converters had more longitudinal reduction in WM, but not GM, volume compared to non-converters. The decreased volumes among converters were mainly localized in the frontal areas. Moreover, baseline global WM volume significantly predicted conversion to PD-MCI, while baseline GM and WM volumes of the frontal and parietal regions were associated with frontal cognitive changes across time.PD patients who develop MCI demonstrate longitudinal reduction in WM volume, especially in the frontal areas. While both regional GM and WM volumes associate with frontal cognitive decline, baseline global WM volume may be a neuroimaging marker of conversion to PD-MCI.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between \u201cpure apathy\u201d and striatal dopamine uptake in untreated, drug-na\u00efve PD patients without clinically significant dementia and/or depression.Fourteen PD patients with pure apathy and 14 PD patients without apathy, matched for age, side of motor symptoms at onset, motor disability and disease duration, underwent both neuropsychological and behavioral examination including self-rated version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-S). All patients underwent 123 I-FP-CIT (DaT-SCAN) SPECT to assess dopamine transporter (DAT) striatal uptake.PD patients with apathy showed lower DAT levels in the striatum than non-apathetic patients. After Bonferroni correction the difference between groups was significant in the right caudate.Apathy is associated with reduced striatal dopamine transporter levels, independent of motor disability and depression in non-demented PD patients. These findings suggest that dysfunction of dopaminergic innervation in the striatum and particularly in the right caudate may contribute to development of apathy in early PD.",

Using diffusion-tensor (DTI) imaging and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) we tested the hypothesis that WM damage in FRDA is more extensive than previously described and probably involves normal-appearing WM.This transversal study included 21 genetically confirmed FRDA patients and seventeen healthy controls that underwent structural MRI of the brain on a 1.5 T scanner. We quantify the severity of ataxia using SARA scale. DTI was performed and diffusion data were analyzed using FMRIB's Diffusion Toolbox in FSL 4.1 in order to identify Fractional anisotropy (FA) decreases in specific brain regions and also the mean, radial and axial diffusivities (MD, RD, AD).The greatest decreases in FA were in the left superior cerebellar peduncle, left posterior thalamic radiation, major forceps, left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and corpus callosum and had a significance level of p\u00a0<\u00a00.01. No significant correlation between FA, AD, MD and RD values and the clinical findings, SARA scores and genetic expansion was found.DTI and TBSS techniques clearly demonstrate the extensive cerebral and cerebellar involvement in FRDA, partially explaining the clinical phenotype of the disease.

Several studies examined affective ToM ability in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), using the \u201cReading the Mind in the Eyes test\u201d (RMET). However, there has been no agreement as to whether or not affective ToM ability is impaired in PD and such discrepancy may be due to the heterogeneous clinical presentation of PD. Affective disturbance has been linked to the akinetic-rigid form of PD and to gait disturbances, like freezing of gait (FOG). Particularly, FOG has been associated with dysfunction in striatum ability of processing affective inputs. Here we hypothesized that the presence of FOG can be associated with impaired affective ToM ability in PD patients.We evaluated ToM by means of RMET and executive functions using the Tower Of London (ToL) test in 29 PD patients (15 with FOG and 14 without FOG) and 19 healthy age-matched subjects.Our results showed that affective ToM is abnormal in PD patients, compared to healthy subjects and that it is more impaired in patients with FOG than in patients without FOG. Further, PD patients with FOG performed worse than PD patients without FOG on the ToL test.The affective aspects of ToM can be associated to FOG in patients with PD, thus supporting the idea that FOG is caused by a complex interplay between motor, cognitive and affective factors, rather than being a pure motor problem.",

     "abstract": "Although white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are associated with cognitive impairments in Parkinson's disease (PD), the relationships between WMHs and cortical atrophy in regard to cognitive impairments are unknown. Here, we investigated the topography of cortical thinning related to deep (DWMHs) and periventricular WMHs (PWMHs) and their differential impacts on cognitive performance in PD.We enrolled 87 patients with non-demented PD and evaluated WMH scores using a semi-quantitative visual rating system. The patients were divided into low-, moderate-, and high-grade groups based on WMH severity for total WMHs (TWMHs), DWMHs, and PWMHs, and cortical thickness was measured using a surface-based method according to the WMHs severity. Additionally, the correlations between WMH-associated cortical thinning and neuropsychological performance were analyzed.The detailed neuropsychological test demonstrated that PD patients with high-grade WMHs showed poorer performance on frontal lobe-based cognitive tasks compared with those with low-grade DWMHs. The areas of cortical thinning were more extensive in patients with DWMHs, involving the entire frontal areas and restricted temporoparietal areas, whereas in patients with PWMHs, cortical thinning was localized in the small frontal areas. A multiple regression analysis of the relationships between WMH-associated cortical thickness and cognition revealed that DWMH-associated frontal thickness had an independent effect on frontal lobe-based cognition, while frontal thickness related to PWMHs did not have a significant correlation with cognitive tasks.These data suggest that in patients with PD, DWMHs are closely coupled with decreased cortical thickness in the frontal areas and may lead to declines in executive function.",

     "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). Optimization of DBS settings can be a challenge due to the number of variables that must be considered, including presence of multiple motor signs, side effects, and battery life.Nine PD subjects visited the clinic for programming at approximately 1, 2, and 4 months post-surgery. During each session, various stimulation settings were assessed and subjects performed motor tasks while wearing a motion sensor to quantify tremor and bradykinesia. At the end of each session, a clinician determined final stimulation settings using standard practices. Sensor-based ratings of motor symptom severities collected during programming were then used to develop two automated programming algorithms \u2013 one to optimize symptom benefit and another to optimize battery life. Therapeutic benefit was compared between the final clinician-determined DBS settings and those calculated by the automated algorithm.Settings determined using the symptom optimization algorithm would have reduced motor symptoms by an additional 13 percentage points when compared to clinician settings, typically at the expense of increased stimulation amplitude. By adding a battery life constraint, the algorithm would have been able to decrease stimulation amplitude by an average of 50% while maintaining the level of therapeutic benefit observed using clinician settings for a subset of programming sessions.Objective assessment in DBS programming can identify settings that improve symptoms or obtain similar benefit as clinicians with improvement in battery life. Both options have the potential to improve post-operative patient outcomes.",

Rhythmic finger tapping is known to strongly engage the cerebellar motor circuitry. We characterize cerebellar and, more specifically, dentate nucleus function, and neural correlates of cerebellar output in essential tremor during rhythmic finger tapping employing functional MRI.Thirty-one propranolol-sensitive essential tremor patients with upper limb tremor and 29 healthy controls were measured. T2*-weighted EPI sequences were acquired. The task consisted of alternating rest and finger tapping blocks. A whole-brain and region-of-interest analysis was performed, the latter focusing on the cerebellar cortex, dentate nucleus and inferior olive nucleus. Activations were also related to tremor severity.In patients, dentate activation correlated positively with tremor severity as measured by the tremor rating scale part A. Patients had reduced activation in widespread cerebellar cortical regions, and additionally in the inferior olive nucleus, and parietal and frontal cortex, compared to controls.The increase in dentate activation with tremor severity supports involvement of the dentate nucleus in essential tremor. Cortical and cerebellar changes during a motor timing task in essential tremor might point to widespread changes in cerebellar output in essential tremor.",

Indican urinary concentration is one of the most common and easily assessable markers of intestinal dysbiosis. Little information is available on intestinal dysbiosis in Parkinson's disease (PD).

Main confounders, such as nutritional habits and constipation diagnosed according to Rome III criteria, were also investigated.Indican urinary concentrations were significantly higher in PD and DPD than in CTR (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively). In PD patients the concentrations were unrelated to the presence of constipation, whereas this symptom was associated with higher concentrations in controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043). The frequency of dairy product consumption was also positively associated with increased concentrations (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Predictors of indican concentrations were sought by multivariate linear regression analysis. The higher indican urinary concentrations found in both DPD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.045) and PD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.023) patients persisted after adjustment for age, gender, BMI, constipation and consumption of dairy products.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important issue in PD, independently of the presence of constipation and starting from the early stages of the disease.

Twelve family members were studied.

These two with abnormal DAT imaging had a PD phenotype, while the remaining three subjects with the novel GCH1 variant had normal DAT imaging and a DRD phenotype.We propose that this GCH1 variant is pathogenic in this family and these findings suggest that similar mechanisms involving abnormal GTP cyclohydolase I may underlie both PD and DRD.

The probably shortest pathogenic allele of 46 repeats was detected in one kindred typically experiencing action tremor. Additionally, compared to the prominent cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia seem to be rare in our SCA12 patients.SCA12 might not be as rare in Chinese as previously assumed.

Non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in Mendelian disorder genes related to parkinsonism, dystonia, ataxia, dementia or neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation were compared between affected siblings.The proband presented with adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism, whereas the affected brother presented with childhood-onset atypical neuroaxonal dystrophy. In the proband, an [18F]FP-CIT PET study showed markedly reduced uptake in the whole putamen, but fluid attenuated inversion recovery and gradient echo MRI studies revealed mild hypointensities in the substantia nigra and the putamen and severe hypointensities in the pallidum. On the other hand, in the affected brother, MRI scans showed severe hypointensities in the substantia nigra and the pallidum, and a [18F]-FP-CIT PET scan was normal. Analysis of the non-synonymous SNVs that were not shared between the two family members revealed non-synonymous SNVs related to parkinsonism including a novel heterozygous mutation (p.T44N) in FBX07 (PARK15) only in the proband, and non-synonymous SNVs related to neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation in the affected brother.Our data suggests that dopaminergic neuronal degeneration may not secondary to iron accumulation in PLAN.

Those with chronic FMDs were offered open-label rTMS over the dominant motor cortex. If they failed to improve they received dominant premotor cortex rTMS. The primary outcome was change from baseline to post-rTMS in quality of life measured by the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) scale. Secondary outcomes were subject and investigator global impression of change (GIC), blinded Rush psychogenic movements rating scale, Barbers suggestibility scale, baseline expectation of benefit scale, and adverse effects.Six subjects were enrolled. For the primary outcome, there was significant improvement in the physical domain scores but significant reduction in psychological domain scores after premotor cortex rTMS compared to baseline and after motor cortex rTMS. There was no significant change between baseline and motor cortex rTMS or in any other domain after premotor cortex rTMS. Secondary outcome measures showed no meaningful change. Transient headache and worsening of FMD symptoms were the most common adverse effects observed.Conclusion: rTMS combined with strong suggestion of benefit provided dissonant results after premotor cortex rTMS with improvement in physical quality of life but reduction in psychological quality of life. These results serve to underscore the complex nature of FMDs where the overt physical manifestation is but one part of a comprehensive neuropsychological syndrome.",

This study aimed at determining predictive factors for a positive effect of NW on PD.Primary outcome was to define the baseline disease-associated and demographic parameters that distinguish patients who demonstrate improvement in the Unified PD rating scale (UPDRS) motor part following NW training (\u201cU+\u201d) from those patients with no improvement after the same intervention (\u201cU\u2212\u201c). The potentially predictive parameters were: age, age at onset, disease duration, gait velocity, step length, daily step number, UPDRS-motor part, Berg-Balance-Scale, Parkinson-Neuropsychometric-Dementia-Assessment, verbal-fluency-test and Becks-Depression-Inventory-II. Twenty-two PD patients (H&Y stage 2\u20132.5) performed twelve weeks of NW training. Eighteen patients were included in the final analysis. Overall, the UPDRS motor part did not improve significantly; however, eight patients had an improvement in the UPDRS motor part from baseline to end of study (U+). When comparing the potentially predictive factors of the U+ cohort with those ten patients who did not improve (U\u2212), there was a notable difference in gait velocity and step length, and showed a significant correlation with an improvement in the UDPRS motor part scores.Gait velocity and step length can predict the outcome of NW training as determined by the UPDRS motor part, indicating that PD patients with only slightly impaired gait performance benefit most.",

MRI with a 3\u00a0T magnet was performed at baseline, 18 months and 36 months with a multiple gradient echo sequence designed for rapid single-scan mapping of the proton transverse relaxation rate R2*. R2* was calculated for midbrain and forebrain basal ganglia regions.A difference in R2* between patients and controls was observed at baseline (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035) but not at 18 or 36 months in the lateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Linear regression indicated significant correlations between the change in R2* in the lateral SNc and the change score in UPDRS III (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and the PDQ-39 -mobility sub-score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) from baseline to 36 months. R2* tended to increase in those with more advanced disease and to decrease in those with milder disease.High field MRI demonstrates lateral SNc abnormalities that progress over 3 years in early PD consistent with increased iron content in those with more advanced disease, corresponding to the known distribution of neuronal loss occurring in this disorder, and correlating with motor symptomatology. Larger and longer investigations with more precise mapping of iron-containing midbrain structures are needed to fully evaluate the potential of R2* as a biomarker of disease progression in PD.",

This study aimed to establish the symptom dimensions of anxiety in PD, and their relationship with depression, autonomic failure and motor symptoms.In this cross-sectional observational study, symptoms of anxiety were measured with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) in 294 PD patients. Symptom dimensions of anxiety in PD were explored through principal component analysis (PCA) of BAI items. The relationship between anxiety and depressive, autonomic and motor symptoms was assessed through PCA and regression analyses.Clinically relevant symptoms of anxiety were present in 45% of patients. PCA of the BAI resulted in five subscales, corresponding to a single affective and four somatic symptom dimensions (thermoregulation, hypotension, hyperventilation and trembling) of anxiety. Symptoms of anxiety and depression displayed a large overlap. All somatic BAI subscales were significantly influenced by motor and autonomic symptoms, while the affective subscale was not.Anxiety in PD comprises affective and somatic symptom dimensions. The affective subscale of the BAI is not influenced by motor or autonomic symptoms, and may therefore prove useful for future research. Scores on the somatic subscales of the BAI were associated with autonomic failure and motor impairment, demonstrating a strong interplay between motor and non-motor symptoms in PD. These results stress the importance of a holistic approach of anxiety in PD.",

In addition, voiding failure occurred more frequently in patients with MSA than in those with PD (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a01.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26\u20132.73). Patients with MSA showed a higher prevalence of low-compliance (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), decreased bladder contractility (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and an increased rate of voiding failure (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In patients with MSA, decreased detrusor contractility was more prominent in the cerebellar ataxia predominant subtype (MSA-C; P\u00a0=\u00a00.038). Multivariate analysis showed that the MSA subtype was the only independent risk factor for impaired detrusor contractility (men, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.692; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006; women, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.965; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007).Impaired detrusor contractility was the pathognomonic urodynamic finding that distinguished MSA from PD.",

Assessments included Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), PD Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39), Frontal assessment battery (FAB) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).Two hundred and seventy-three PD patients (52.7%) reported drooling (droolers). Drooling occurred more frequently in the late-onset PD patients than the early-onset PD patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Droolers had higher levodopa equivalent daily doses, higher incidences of dysarthria, dysphagia and fluctuation, higher scores for the UPDRS part III, NMSS, HAMD and HAMA, and higher scores for the mobility, activities of daily life, stigma and communication subdomains of the PDQ-39 than the non-droolers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The percentage of benzhexol use in the non-droolers was significantly higher than the droolers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The FAB and MoCA scores between the droolers and non-droolers were not different. The binary logistic regression analysis indicated that dysarthria, dysphagia, benzhexol use, and a lower score for the naming domain of the MoCA were associated with drooling.Drooling is a relatively common disabling symptom in Chinese PD patients. Patients with dysarthria, dysphagia and naming disorder are likely to experience drooling. Drooling is not correlated with disease duration and motor severity of PD.",

However, relationships between former smoking and PD have been poorly investigated.We recruited 116 de novo PD subjects, and investigated current, former and never smoking, and reasons for smoking cessation among former smokers. Two hundred and thirty-two controls were matched by Propensity Score.PD subjects and controls were found to be current smokers (7.7 vs. 39.6%), former smokers (43.9 vs. 6.5%) and never smokers (48.2 vs. 53.9%). Logistic regression showed that current smokers were less likely to have PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.10\u20130.46), while former smokers were more likely to have PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; OR: 7.6; 95% CI: 4.09\u201315.75), as compared to never smokers. Fifty-one PD patients reported quitting smoking before PD diagnosis (mean time since cessation 9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3 years). Most important reasons to quit smoking in PD group were illness different from PD (26 subjects, 51.0%), knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking (24 subjects, 47.0%), and physician's advice (1 subject, 2.0%).The reduced prevalence of current smokers among PD subjects as compared to healthy controls is consistent with previous findings, suggesting a possible neuroprotective effect of smoking. However, it could be due, at least in part, to the increased prevalence of former smokers among PD patients, that were more prone to quit smoking as compared to healthy controls. We suggest that smoking cessation could be an early preclinical condition occurring in PD.",

Fall events were collected using standardised protocols and were categorized by fall frequency (non-faller, single fall, recurrent falls) and also by a novel classification based on pre-fall event: (1) engaged in advanced activity; (2) ambulation; and (3) transition. Non-parametric statistics compared groups in both classifications.At baseline 23 (20.7%) of the cohort had fallen, increasing to 41 (36.9%) participants over 12 months. Total time spent walking was significantly lower for transition fallers compared with non-fallers and ambulation fallers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041), who also had significantly increased disease severity. There were no significant relationships when fallers were categorized by frequency. We present an inverted U curve model depicting the relationship between falls and activity over time in PD, and propose that at this stage transition and ambulation fallers occupy different places on the curve.Falls are more common than recognised in newly-diagnosed PD. Daily activity is reduced even in early disease for people who fall during transitions. Classification methods that take pre-fall event into account may be useful to understand the heterogeneity of this complex problem.",

To determine cognitive predictors of intermediate (6-month) and long-term (1-year) post-operative outcomes, the changes in functional and quality-of-life (QOL) scores were analyzed in a smaller group with available preoperative health status measures.We identified 130 patients [71% male, mean age: 63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.1, mean PD duration: 10.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1]. At preoperative assessment, 60% of patients had multiple-domain MCI, 21% had single-domain MCI, and 19% had normal cognition. MCI presence and type as well as DRS performance did not affect immediate outcomes. Attention impairment predicted longer postoperative hospitalization (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0015) and showed a trend towards occurrence of postoperative confusion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.089).For intermediate and long-term outcomes we identified 56 patients [73.2% male, mean age: 61.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6, mean PD duration: 10.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7].

Reassessments were conducted at 4 and 8 years, and then annually. FOG, as well as severity of parkinsonism, motor complications, and psychotic symptoms were assessed by the Unified PD Rating Scale, and cognitive impairment by the Mini-Mental State Examination. Generalized estimating equations were applied to investigate baseline risk factors and concomitants of FOG over time.The point prevalence of FOG at baseline was 27% (95% confidence interval (95%-CI) 22\u201333%).

However, recent research suggested limb-kinetic apraxia as an important component of impaired fine motor skills in PD. In contrast to bradykinesia, limb-kinetic apraxia only marginally responds to dopaminergic treatment. Here we investigate the novel hypothesis that the dexterity deficits are related to an intrinsic dysfunction of primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which is not reversible\u00a0by dopaminergic medication.Applying a standard and approved dexterity task (coin rotation), brain activation networks were investigated using functional magnetic resonance imaging in PD patients both ON and OFF medication and matched healthy controls.PD patients both ON and OFF medication showed impaired S1 activation relative to controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05; region of interest based analysis). The impaired S1 activation remained unchanged by dopaminergic medication. Despite the considerable clinical deficit, no other brain area showed impaired activation. In contrast, structures of the basal ganglia \u2013 motor cortex loop responded to dopaminergic medication. Behaviorally, dexterity performance both ON and OFF was significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduced relative to controls.Our results provide first evidence that dexterity deficits in PD are related to an S1 dysfunction which is insensitive to dopaminergic treatment.",

     "abstract": "It remains unclear whether the mtDNA content is related to the clinicopathological prognosis in Parkinson's disease (PD).We analyzed the copy number of mtDNA using quantitative real-time PCR in 414 cases with PD and 231 healthy subjects from mainland of China. The level of mtDNA was significantly decreased in PD patients' peripheral blood as compared to that of healthy controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Furthermore, lower mtDNA copy number was more frequently detected (75%) in the older onset age group (\u226550 years old) than that in (49%) the younger group (<50 years old, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), suggesting mtDNA content might be an important genetic event in PD progression. Using direct sequencing, we examined the mutations in the D-loop region of mtDNA in 318 PD patients. The results revealed that 17% of the PD patients carried mutations in the D-loop of mtDNA, and 55% of these mutations were heteroplasmic. In addition, PD patients harboring AA\u00a0+\u00a0AA genotype of c.2070\u201312T\u00a0>\u00a0A and c.2070-64G\u00a0>\u00a0A in POLG1 along with mutations in POLG1 had a significantly lower copy number of mtDNA than those of PD patients without POLG1 alterations.Our results provided evidence for a significantly lower of mtDNA copy number in PD patients and POLG1 variation for reducing mtDNA copy number in PD.",

After post hoc checking, these values were proposed as cut-off points for estimating NMS burden based only on the accumulation of symptoms.Burden and number of NMS correlate closely (r\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.80). On the basis of this finding, five levels (0\u00a0=\u00a0No NMS to 4\u00a0=\u00a0Very severe) of NMSQuest grading were proposed after identification of their cut-offs by ordinal logistic regression and median and interquartile range distribution. These values coincided almost completely with those obtained by median and interquartile range in an independent sample. Concordance between this classification and HY staging was weak (weighted kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.30), but was substantial (weighted kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.68) with the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale grading.Completion of NMSQuest and subsequent grading of the burden could allow the health care professional to approach the severity of NMS burden using the self completed NMSQuest in a primary care setting.",

     "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is the most frequent movement disorder in adults. Its pathophysiology is not clearly understood, however there is growing evidence showing common etiologic factors with other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases (AD, PD). Recently, a rare p.R47H substitution (rs75932628) in the TREM2 protein (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; OMIM: *605086) has been proposed as a risk factor for AD, PD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The objective of the study was to determine whether TREM2 p.R47H allele is also a risk factor for developing ET.This was a cross-sectional multicenter international study. An initial case-control cohort from Spain (n\u00a0=\u00a0456 ET, n\u00a0=\u00a02715 controls) was genotyped. In a replication phase, a case-control series (n\u00a0=\u00a0897 ET, n\u00a0=\u00a01449 controls) from different populations (Italy, Germany, North-America and Taiwan) was studied. Owed to the rarity of the variant, published results on p.R47H allele frequency from 14777 healthy controls from European, North American or Chinese descent were additionally considered. The main outcome measure was p.R47H (rs75932628) allelic frequency.There was a significant association between TREM2 p.R47H variant and ET in the Spanish cohort (odds ratio [OR], 5.97; 95% CI, 1.203\u201329.626; p\u00a0=\u00a00.042), but it was not replicated in other populations.These results argue in favor of population-specific differences in the allelic distribution and suggest that p.R47H (rs75932628) variant may contribute to the susceptibility of ET in Spanish population. However, taking into account the very low frequency of p.R47H, further confirmatory analyses of larger ET series are needed.",

Symptoms of OH include lightheadedness, dizziness, postural instability, vertigo and blurred vision. OH considerably contributes to disease burden and reduced quality of life for PD patients.To determine whether the severity of OH in PD advances significantly with the duration of the disease.For 106 PD patients lying-to-standing orthostatic tests were performed to evaluate orthostasis. Severity of OH was measured as maximal drop of systolic blood pressure (SBP) after postural challenge, as the mean of three measurements. The relationship between the maximal drop of SBP and the duration of PD was tested applying ANOVA. Consecutively, 64 patients under regular ambulant supervision received appointments to evaluate their orthostasis repeatedly. From these patients a separate cohort was set up to investigate OH progression in the course of PD.The lack of a correlation between the severity of OH in PD and the duration of the disease was determined (p\u00a0=\u00a00.064). The long term analysis for the patients under regular ambulant supervision demonstrated that the severity of OH does not advance in the course of PD in a statistically significant manner (p\u00a0=\u00a00.83).OH does not appear to be a symptom only of the late stage of PD.

Diagnosis can be challenging in early disease and in atypical cases.We reviewed the literature on the application of dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography (DAT-SPECT) in degenerative parkinsonism and related disorders as a diagnostic tool.The use of DAT-SPECT shows some utility in the early diagnosis of PD and differentiation from other non-degenerative parkinsonian disorders (i.e. essential tremor, dystonic tremor, drug-induced and in most cases of psychogenic parkinsonism), since it can accurately detect the presynaptic dopaminergic deficit. The test has been shown to have high sensitivity/specificity by multiple studies. DAT imaging may also have some prognostic value for disease progression. However, it has limited value in differentiating among degenerative causes of parkinsonism. DAT imaging has some limitations. In most studies, true test accuracy is unknown since the gold standard is clinical diagnosis by a movement disorders neurologist. Therefore, the sensitivity of the test cannot exceed that of the clinical diagnosis. In addition, false negative scans occur and highlight the need for clinical follow-up.Clinical assessment remains the most important aspect in evaluating these patients. DAT-SPECT is a sensitive modality to detect nigrostriatal degeneration. In spite of increasing data using this technique, however, more long-term clinical studies are required to determine how DAT-SPECT scan can guide decision-making.",

     "abstract": "Several case reports and small series have indicated that tardive dystonia is responsive to globus pallidus deep brain stimulation. Whether different subtypes or distributions of tardive dystonia are associated with different outcomes remains unknown.We assessed the outcomes and temporal profile of improvement of eight tardive dystonia patients who underwent globus pallidus deep brain stimulation over the past six years through record review. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, it was not blinded or placebo controlled.Consistent with previous studies, deep brain stimulation improved the overall the Burke\u2013Fahn\u2013Marsden motor scores by 85.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.5%. The distributions with best responses in descending order were upper face, lower face, larynx/pharynx, limbs, trunk, and neck. Patients with prominent cervical dystonia demonstrated improvement in the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale but improvements took several months. In four patients the effects of deep brain stimulation on improvement in Burke Fahn Marsden score was rapid, while in four cases there was partial rapid response of neck and trunk dystonia followed by was gradual resolution of residual symptoms over 48 months.Our retrospective analysis shows excellent resolution of tardive dystonia after globus pallidus deep brain stimulation. We found instantaneous response, except with neck and trunk dystonia where partial recovery was followed by further resolution at slower rate. Such outcome is encouraging for using deep brain stimulation in treatment of tardive dystonia.",

     "abstract": "Constipation is one of most frequent non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) and it may precede the clinical diagnosis of PD by years, with negative effects on quality of life. In contrast to motor features, levodopa is ineffective and possibly detrimental on constipation. Treatment of constipation in PD is non-specific and frequently unsuccessful. Stemming from a clinical observation of unexpected relief of bothersome constipation, abdominal bloating and pain after treatment with the beta-blocker carvedilol in one patient, we have evaluated the association between the use of beta-blockers and the presence of constipation in a large, unselected PD cohort.Retrospective review of the medical records of every patient with a diagnosis of PD seen in the Movement Disorders clinic at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center from October 2010 to April 2014.341 medical records with a primary diagnosis of PD were reviewed, 336 of which contained information about constipation. Overall, 205/336 patients (61%) reported constipation. Among the 66 subjects treated with beta-blockers at the time of the encounter of record, only 28 (42.4%) reported constipation. By comparison, among the 270 subjects not treated with beta-blockers, 177 (65.5%) had constipation (\u03c72 test p value\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Multivariate logistic analysis showed an odds ratio (OR) of 0.293 for beta-blockers (95% C.I. 0.161\u20130.535, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), 2.287 for levodopa (95% C.I. 1.271\u20134.117, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and 1.805 for dopamine agonists (95% C.I. 1.039\u20133.136, p\u00a0=\u00a00.036).Beta-blockers are associated with a lower risk of constipation, while dopaminergic treatments appear to increase risk of constipation.",

     "abstract": "Visual hallucinations are an important non-motor complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) and carry a negative prognosis. Their biological basis is uncertain, but may relate to the activity of resting state networks in brain. We therefore aimed to investigate functional activity of brain in patients with visual hallucinations (PDVH) in resting state compared to patients without hallucinations (PDnonVH) and a healthy control group (HC).Resting state functional MRI was acquired and the primary analysis compared the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) across groups. This informed a secondary analysis, in the PD groups only, comparing functional connectivity between a \u2018seed\u2019 region in the occipital lobe and the rest of the brain.Individuals with PDVH showed lower ALFF in bilateral lingual gyrus and cuneus and greater ALFF in temporo-parietal regions, medial temporal gyrus and cerebellum than PDnonVH and HC. PDnonVH also had lower ALFF in occipitoparietal region and greater ALFF in medial temporal gyrus, temporo-parietal and cerebellum regions than HC. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that, although both PD groups had lower occipital functional connectivity relative to the HC group, occipital \u2013 corticostriatal connectivity was significantly higher in those with PDVH compared with PDnonVH.Our study reveals widespread hemodynamic alterations in PD. However, within a functionally abnormal occipital lobe, those with PDVH have even lower ALFF than non-hallucinators, but have higher occipital functional connectivity with cortical-striatal regions. These findings suggest disruption of pathways underpinning both primary visual perceptual and intrinsic visual integration may contribute to visual hallucinations in PD.",

This study aimed to (1) present self-report data on medication adherence in ET cases, (2) examine the demographic and clinical factors that might be associated with lower medication adherence.151 ET cases were enrolled in a clinical-epidemiological study at Columbia University. An 11-item medication adherence questionnaire, modeled after the Morisky medication adherence questionnaire, was administered.Seventy-three (48.3%) of 151 cases were taking daily medication for ET. One-third (24/73; 32.9%) of cases reported that they sometimes forgot to take their medication, and 1 in 5 (15/73; 20.5%) reported missed doses within the past week. Most striking was that nearly 1 in 4 (17/73; 23.3%) reported that there were whole days in the past two weeks in which they had not taken their medication. A factor analysis revealed four factors that captured different aspects of non-adherence. Higher non-adherence was associated with more depressive symptoms, younger age, and less severe tremor but was not associated with type or number of ET medications.Approximately one in four ET patients reported whole days in the past two weeks in which they had not taken their medication. It is possible that this relatively high rate of non-adherence could be a function of the poor therapeutic efficacy of the medications currently available to treat ET.",

The aim of our analysis was to explore the factor structure of the HAMD in a large sample of PD patients.A principal component analysis of the 17-item HAMD was performed on data of 341 PD patients, available from a previous cross sectional study on anxiety. An eigenvalue \u22651 was used to determine the number of factors. Factor loadings \u22650.4 in combination with oblique rotations were used to identify which variables made up the factors. Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure (KMO), Cronbach's alpha, Bartlett's test, communality, percentage of non-redundant residuals and the component correlation matrix were computed to assess factor validity.KMO verified the sample's adequacy for factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha indicated a good internal consistency of the total scale. Six factors had eigenvalues \u22651 and together explained 59.19% of the variance. The number of items per factor varied from 1 to 6. Inter-item correlations within each component were low. There was a high percentage of non-redundant residuals and low communality.This analysis demonstrates that the factorial validity of the HAMD in PD is unsatisfactory. This implies that the scale is not appropriate for studying specific symptom domains of depression based on factorial structure in a PD population.",

Considering that there is overlap of the clinical manifestations and pathological characteristics between PD and MSA, we studied the possible associations between R1628P and G2385R polymorphisms of the LRRK2 and MSA in a population of Han Chinese patients.A total of 318 MSA patients and 350 unrelated age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in the study. All subjects were genotyped for R1628P and G2385R using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis and direct sequencing.No significant differences were observed in the genotype distribution and minor allele frequency (MAF) of R1628P between MSA patients and HCs (P\u00a0=\u00a00.418 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.424), between MSA-C and HCs (P\u00a0=\u00a00.347 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.353), between MSA-P and HCs (P\u00a0=\u00a00.787 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.790), and between MSA-C and MSA-P (P\u00a0=\u00a00.606 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.610).

With this in mind, the current pilot study aimed to distinguish between Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (iPD), other Parkinsonian syndromes (non-iPD) and healthy subjects, by a breath test that analyzes the exhaled volatile organic compounds using a highly sensitive nanoarray.Breath samples of 44 iPD, 16 non-iPD patients and 37 healthy controls were collected. The samples were passed over a nanoarray and the resulting electrical signals were analyzed with discriminant factor analysis as well as by a K-fold cross-validation method, to test the accuracy of the model.Comparison of non-iPD with iPD states yielded 88% sensitivity, 88% accuracy, and 88% Receiver Operating Characteristic area under the curve in the training set samples with known identity. The validation set of this comparison scored 81% sensitivity and accuracy and 92% negative predictive value. Comparison between atypical parkinsonism states and healthy subjects scored 94% sensitivity and 85% accuracy in the training set samples with known identity. The validation set of this comparison scored 81% sensitivity and 78% accuracy. The obtained results were not affected by l-Dopa or MAO-B inhibitor treatment.Exhaled breath analysis with nanoarray is a promising approach for a non-invasive, inexpensive, and portable technique for differentiation between different Parkinsonian states. A larger cohort is required in order to establish the clinical usefulness of the method.",

It is still unknown why some individuals adapt better than others in response to such burdens. This review is the first to synthesize and evaluate the evidence on the predictive factors of psychosocial outcomes in PwP carers.Studies which identified predictors of psychosocial outcomes for unpaid carers were included. PsychINFO, EMBASE, AMED, BNI and CINAHL databases were searched, supplemented by scanning of references lists of included studies and relevant journals from 2008 onwards. Quality was assessed using the NICE methodology checklist for prognostic studies.Twenty-nine studies were included in the review, providing a low-level of evidence. Carer burden was investigated in 18 studies and mental health and quality of life (QoL) in seven studies each. PwP non-motor symptoms and QoL and carer depression were consistently identified as predictors for at least one psychosocial outcome. Demographics and disease factors were consistently found not to be predictors. Carer involvement and protective factors (e.g. social support, personality) demonstrated promising findings but studies were too few or factors measured inconsistently.Confident conclusions could not be drawn regarding the most important predictors that should be targeted in psychosocial interventions due to methodological weaknesses and lack of theoretical testing across the current literature. Future research should build upon psychological theory to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms that explain how carers adapt to caregiving.",

DTI data were compared between PD patients and controls, and also between PD patients with and without FOG. Whole brain voxel-based analysis and regions of interest analysis in the pedunculopontine nucleus were used for DTI analysis.Compared with normal controls, PD patients showed microstructural changes in various subcortical structures (substantia nigra, globus pallidum and thalamus), frontal and insula cortex. PD patients with FOG demonstrated altered mean diffusivities in subcortical structures connected with pedunculopontine nucleus, such as basal ganglia, thalamus and cerebellum in voxel-based analysis. Using region of interest analysis of pedunculopontine nucleus, fractional anisotropy values were reduced and mean diffusivity values were increased bilaterally in PD patients with FOG. In correlation analysis, the fractional anisotropy value of the right pedunculopontine nucleus was moderately correlated with the severity of FOG.Based on our results, microstructural changes of pedunculopontine nucleus and connected subcortical structures are closely related with FOG in PD patients.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a surprisingly heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder. It is well established that different subtypes of PD present with different clinical courses and prognoses. However, the neural mechanism underlying these disparate presentations is uncertain.Here we used resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and the regional homogeneity (ReHo) method to determine neural activity patterns in the two main clinical subgroups of PD (akinetic-rigid and tremor-dominant).Compared with healthy controls, akinetic-rigid (AR) subjects had increased ReHo mainly in right amygdala, left putamen, bilateral angular gyrus, bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), and decreased ReHo in left post cingulate gyrus/precuneus (PCC/PCu) and bilateral thalamus. In contrast, tremor-dominant (TD) patients showed higher ReHo mostly in bilateral angular gyrus, left PCC, cerebellum_crus1, and cerebellum_6, while ReHo was decreased in right putamen, primary sensory cortex (S1), vermis_3, and cerebellum_4_5. These results indicate that AR and TD subgroups both represent altered spontaneous neural activity in default-mode regions and striatum, and AR subjects exhibit more changed neural activity in the mesolimbic cortex (amygdala) but TD in the cerebellar regions. Of note, direct comparison of the two subgroups revealed a distinct ReHo pattern primarily located in the striatal-thalamo-cortical (STC) and cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) loops.Overall, our findings highlight the involvement of default mode network (DMN) and STC circuit both in AR and TD subtypes, but also underscore the importance of integrating mesolimbic-striatal and CTC loops in understanding neural systems of akinesia and rigidity, as well as resting tremor in PD. This study provides improved understanding of the pathophysiological models of different subtypes of PD.",

Furthermore, differences in PD-MCI frequencies were examined when comparing performance on current neuropsychological testing to the normative sample, as opposed to decline from premorbid functioning, as evidence of cognitive impairment.Two hundred and thirty-four non-demented PD patients underwent neurological and neuropsychological assessment at the Parkinson's Disease Research Clinic at the Brain and Mind Research Institute, University of Sydney.When cognitive impairment was defined as 1SD and 1.5SD below premorbid intellect, 109 patients (47%) and 76 (32%) patients met criteria for PD-MCI respectively. This proportion dropped considerably to 50 patients (21%) with a 2SD cut-off score. However, when calculating impairment based on comparisons with normative data, only 68 patients (29%) and 41 patients (18%) met PD-MCI criteria when a cut-off score of 1 and 1.5SD was employed. This proportion dropped to just 22 patients (9%) with a 2SD cut-off score.Results from the present study suggest that the MDS PD-MCI criteria may be too broad, as substantial differences in frequencies of PD-MCI were observed with the application of differing criteria. We propose that a 1.5SD cut-off score below premorbid functioning may provide greater utility in characterizing PD-MCI than a 1.5SD cut-off below normative data, which has been widely applied in previous studies examining the MDS PD-MCI criteria.",

Modification was assessed as changing from one APD to another and/or adding a new APD to an existing regimen. Nonadherence was measured using Medication Possession Ratio <0.8. Discrete-time survival analyses were used to estimate the effect of prior nonadherent behavior on initiating APD modifications. Generalized linear models were used to estimate the effect of initiating medication modifications on subsequent 3-month medical use and costs.Initiation of APD modifications in any given month was higher among patients who were nonadherent to APDs in the preceding month (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a01.23), compared to their adherent counterparts. Modifications significantly predicted higher risk of all-cause and PD-related hospitalizations (adjusted relative risk [RR]\u00a0=\u00a01.22 and 1.83, respectively), home health agency utilization (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.18 and 1.52), and use of physician services (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.14 and 1.41), as well as higher total all-cause healthcare expenditures (mean\u00a0=\u00a0$1064) in any given 3-month interval.Prior nonadherence to APDs might influence initiation of APD modification. APD modifications were associated with increased health care utilization and expenditures, with the caveats that indications of modifications and disease severity may still play roles. Prescribers should consider patients' medication adherence when changing APD regimens to lower the costs of medical services.",

Misdiagnosis of Parkinson's disease can lead to inappropriate long-term medication use and exposure to their potentially harmful side effects. Functional imaging of the dopamine transporter (DaT) defines integrity of the striatal dopaminergic system and provides a marker for presynaptic neuronal degeneration. DaT imaging is abnormal even in the earliest clinical presentations of parkinsonism associated with nigrostriatal degeneration and a normal scan suggests an alternative diagnosis such as essential tremor, dystonic tremor, drug-induced parkinsonism, or psychogenic parkinsonism.The main objective of our study was to determine the impact of DaT imaging on the clinical diagnosis and management of patients with clinically uncertain parkinsonian syndromes, especially in patients with exposure to neuroleptics, in our tertiary movement disorders referral center.We performed a retrospective chart review of all 65 patients who had DaTscans from August 2011 to December 2012.Our management changed in 63% of patients as a result of the DaTscan.

PD patients had lower BMI, lower uric acid level, higher HAMD score and had sexual intercourse (SI) less frequently. SD correlated with greater disease severity and depression. The most distressing problem in male patients was PE (51.4%) and orgasmic dissatisfaction (76%) for female patients. Logistic regression analysis found 3 factors were related to SD: no SI in the past month (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), postural instability (PI) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028), and HAMD item 14 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021), predicting SD with the OR of 12.2, 5.5, and 5.0 respectively.SD in PD is common and usually occurs with depression. Absence of SI in the past month, PI, and loss of libido are predictors of SD in PD. A simple and quick screening of SD can be routinely performed by inquiring patients about the frequency of SI and the examination of the pull test. Detailed assessment of sexual functioning and depression may guide physicians in proper management.",

While neuroleptic induced parkinsonism (NIP) is often thought to be well understood in terms of its clinical course, pathophysiology, and treatment, this is clearly not the case, and almost all our current beliefs are based on data published decades ago of dubious merit, and recent studies which are confounded by design conflicts. This article attempts to highlight gaps in our knowledge. While there are data on the stigma associated with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, there are none on NIP, where the problem is most likely much greater. The natural course of NIP remains unknown, including the question of whether this is a risk factor for the later development of tardive dyskinesia. While treatment with anticholinergics or amantadine is the norm, there are weak and conflicting data on whether these have much value. Why quetiapine and clozapine do not worsen motor function in people with idiopathic PD, while all other neuroleptic do, remains uncertain. Neuroleptics are among the most widely prescribed medications in the United States, with 20% of nursing home residents taking them, with an increasing use for treating depression as well as psychosis, underscoring the importance of understanding NIP, the most important adverse motor effect of this class of drugs.",

The objective of this pilot randomized clinical trial was to investigate whether a balance training program using augmented visual feedback is feasible, safe, and more effective than conventional balance training in improving postural control in patients with PD.Thirty-three patients with idiopathic PD participated in a five-week training program consisting of ten group treatment sessions of 60\u00a0min. Participants were randomly allocated to (1) an experimental group who trained on workstations consisting of interactive balance games with explicit augmented visual feedback (VFT), or (2) a control group receiving conventional training. Standing balance, gait, and health status were assessed at entry, at six weeks, and at twelve weeks follow-up.Sixteen patients were allocated to the control group and seventeen to the experimental group. The program was feasible to apply and took place without adverse events. Change scores for all balance measures favored VFT, but the change in the primary outcome measure, i.e. the Functional Reach test, did not differ between groups (t(28)\u00a0=\u00a0-0.116, p\u00a0=\u00a0.908). No other differences between groups were statistically significant.VFT proved to be a feasible and safe approach to balance therapy for patients with PD. In this proof-of-concept study VFT was not superior over conventional balance training although observed trends mostly favored VFT. These trends approached clinical relevance only in few cases: increasing the training load and further optimization of VFT may strengthen this effect.Controlled Trials, ISRCTN47046299.",

The pathophysiology is unknown but it is hypothesized that it relates to cognitive abnormalities; particularly executive and visuospatial dysfunction. However, prior results have been discrepant. Pharmacologic subtypes of FOG include those that are responsive and unresponsive to levodopa.To determine whether executive and visuospatial dysfunction are associated specifically with the levodopa unresponsive subtype of FOG.135 PD subjects completed a single assessment included FOG questionnaire, UPDRS motor scale, comprehensive cognitive battery and measure of hallucinations. Analyses compared unresponsive (n\u00a0=\u00a016), responsive (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and no FOG (n\u00a0=\u00a099) subtypes.The unresponsive subtype had a significantly older age of onset of PD than the responsive group (p\u00a0=\u00a0.03) and had worse motor scores (p\u00a0=\u00a0.003) than the no FOG group. Longer disease duration was associated with the responsive group compared to the no FOG group (p\u00a0=\u00a0.002). The unresponsive FOG group had significantly poorer visuospatial ability (p\u00a0=\u00a0.001) and executive functioning (p\u00a0=\u00a0.02) than both the no and responsive FOG subgroups. These latter groups were not significantly different. The responsive FOG group was associated with the presence of hallucinations.Aside from pharmacological differences, unresponsive FOG is associated with executive and visuospatial dysfunction implicating frontostriatal pathways while responsive FOG is associated with hallucinations suggesting involvement of posterior cortical regions. Further study and treatment of FOG should include appropriate subtype classification.",

All patients were screened with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) for depression. The diagnosis of dementia was based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV Text Revision criteria. Each patient was rated on the CGIS.CGIS ratings were available for 1438 patients, of which 50.8% were rated as \u201cborderline\u201d to \u201cmoderately ill\u201d and 49.2% as \u201cmarkedly\u201d to \u201cextremely ill.\u201d Worse ratings were associated with higher age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), longer PD duration (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and female sex (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The impact of patient and physician variables on CGIS rating was calculated with three regression models (A: single bivariate regression; B: multivariate regression; and C: multivariate, multilevel regression, including physician variables). In all models, higher UPDRS-II scores and longer disease duration of PD were the strongest predictors for a worse CGIS rating. In the multivariate models (B and C), neuropsychiatric symptoms were unrelated to the CGIS rating.The additional burden of dementia and depression was underestimated in the CGIS rating, suggesting that they are possibly relativized against the motor impairment.",

After adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and concomitant medication use, patients with constipation were more likely to develop PD than subjects without constipation; the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 3.28 (95% CI: 2.14\u20135.03), 3.83 (2.51\u20135.84), and 4.22 (2.95\u20136.05) for individual constipation severity categories. Constipation severity was also associated with an increased likelihood of PD in the time-varying analysis; the aHR was 2.84 (2.43\u20133.33), 5.22 (4.61\u20135.92), and 10.47 (9.46\u201311.58) for mild, moderate, and severe constipation, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). After excluding PD patients diagnosed within 3 years of constipation, the association remained significant.Our study suggests that the severity of constipation is associated with a future diagnosis of PD in a dose-dependent manner.",

     "abstract": "A progressive reduction in the speed and amplitude of repetitive action is an essential component of bradykinesia, which is called sequence effect (SE). Because SE is specific to Parkinson's disease (PD) and is suggested to be associated with motor arrest, its features are of great interest. The aim of this study was, for the first time, to find the neural correlates of SE and to demonstrate whether dopaminergic deficit is correlated with SE.We enrolled 12 patients with de novo PD at a tertiary referral hospital. Correlations between SE severity and alterations in gray and white matter were studied. The association between severity of the SE and striatal dopaminergic deficits was also analyzed.There was a significant negative correlation between the volumetric changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior semilunar lobule of the cerebellum and the degree of SE. There was a significant correlation between the long association fibers (the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the uncinate fasciculus, and the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus) connecting the frontal lobes to the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes and SE. There was a significant negative correlation between SE in the more affected hand and the caudate dopamine transporter binding in the more affected hemisphere.Our results suggest that the ACC and the cerebellum (inferior semilunar lobule) are associated with the severity of SE. Taken together with DTI findings, the present study proposes that ACC may have an important role. Our data show that the caudate dopaminergic activity may be related to SE.",

Information about factors related to swallowing disturbances, such as disease duration, age at assessment and concomitant dementia, is limited and would be useful for their management.All consecutive PD out-patients evaluated at a movement disorders clinic over a 7-year period (2007\u20132014), were included in the present retrospective study. Presence of symptomatic swallowing disturbances was assessed using the specific item of the Non Motor Symptom Questionnaire.In the whole PD population (N\u00a0=\u00a06462), prevalence of symptomatic swallowing disturbances was 11.7% (95%CI, 10.9\u201312.5). Multivariable logistic regression analysis (adjusted for education) disclosed a significant interaction between disease duration and gender (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). In both gender strata, swallowing disturbances were significantly associated with longer disease duration and dementia (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for all). A significant effect for age at assessment was also found in male patients. In non-demented patients, swallowing disturbances were associated with male gender, age and disease duration (P\u00a0<\u00a00.02 for all). In demented patients an association was found only with male gender (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018) and disease duration (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Gender, age, disease duration and dementia all seem to contribute to the occurrence of swallowing disturbances independently. However, the role played by these factors in sub-groups of patients stratified by gender and concomitant dementia suggests that swallowing disturbances are likely related to different neuro-degenerative patterns within the brain. The underlying mechanisms deserve further investigation.",

As well, PRRT2 mutations have been detected in patients with PED or PNKD. To date, most of the mutations have been found to be nonsense.We used inhibitors of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway --emetine dihydrochloride hydrate and cycloheximide and silencing regulator of nonsense transcripts 1(UPF1) with immortalized lymphoblasts to detect whether the truncated mutations lead to NMD, a type of mRNA surveillance in every eukaryotic cell proved so far and that generally degrades mRNA containing premature translation termination codons (PTCs). In addition, we transfected the SH-SY5Y cells with wild-type and mutant PRRT2 plasmids to identify the PRRT2 protein's subcellular localization.We detected, low expression of truncated PRRT2 and was further rescued by applying the inhibitor of NMD pathway, suggesting that NMD plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PKD by haplo-insufficiency. Moreover, for the small portion of undegraded mutant PRRT2 that was translated into truncated proteins, their cellular localization changed from membrane to cytoplasm and nuclear, which might lead to a functional loss.We suggest that the NMD of truncated mutation of PRRT2 and altered cellular localization of undegraded of PRRT2, might lead to PKD.",

MMSE is commonly used in clinical practice and longitudinal studies found a relationship between the MMSE pentagon copying item and progression to dementia, but its neuroanatomical correlates have been poorly investigated. The aim of this study is to investigate the MRI structural correlates of the global MMSE and the pentagon item scores in PD patients in the absence of dementia.We selected a sample of 92 PD patients and 36 controls. MMSE was used as a global measure of cognitive status, and the pentagon copying test as a measure of visuospatial performance. FreeSurfer software was used to assess intergroup differences in cortical thickness (CTh) and global atrophy measures, as well as their relationship with cognitive performance.Compared to controls, patients showed significant differences in measures of global atrophy, which correlated with performance on MMSE and the pentagon item. Regional differences in CTh were seen between PD patients and controls bilaterally in the temporo-parietal-occipital region. Patients with impaired performance compared with those of normal performance also showed CTh reductions in these regions.Our results suggest MMSE and the pentagon item reflect brain changes which at a regional level involve mainly posterior regions. Correlates of the pentagon item were seen in the same regions where PD patients exhibited significant thinning, and involved more areas and bigger cluster sizes than the correlates of MMSE global scores.",

In patients who experience suboptimal clinical results with conventional programming (monopolar, double monopolar or bipolar settings), interleaved pulses can sometimes be used to provide differential therapeutic benefits with the possibility of fewer side effects. Interleaving allows a clinician to define two \u201cprograms\u201d that automatically alternate. The goal of this paper is to 1) present clinical scenarios where DBS interleaving was used across two clinics to provide improved symptom control in three patients with suboptimal results from conventional programming; 2) address the potential mechanisms of interleaving; and 3) provide practical tips on the use of interleaving.Three patients were formally compared for therapeutic benefit on interleaved and conventional parameter settings.Interleaving is most likely to be useful in two clinical scenarios: 1) different contacts are beneficial for specific symptoms, but each at a different stimulation amplitude; or 2) symptoms are resolved incompletely, and further voltage increase is limited by side effects. The factors underpinning the differences in outcomes with interleaving are unknown but may be highly dependent on specific symptoms and to electrode positioning. Interleaving is a relatively new programming platform and there is no data to demonstrate long-term benefits.Interleaving is a tool that may augment outcomes, and possibly obviate the need for surgical revisions, although in our experience across two large centers it has been effective for only a small number of patients.",

Drooling, an excessive pooling and spillover of saliva out of the oral cavity, is one of the non-motor symptoms in PD patients that produces various negative physical and psychosocial consequences for patients and their caregivers. At present, the pathophysiology of drooling in PD is not completely certain; however, impaired intra-oral salivary clearance is likely the major contributor. There are neither standard diagnostic criteria nor standard severity assessment tools for evaluating drooling in PD. In accordance with the possible pathophysiology, dopaminergic agents have been used to improve salivary clearance; however, these agents are not completely effective in controlling drooling. Various pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options have been studied. Local injection with botulinum toxin serotypes A and B into major salivary glands is most effective to reduce drooling. Future research to explore the exact pathophysiology and develop standard diagnostic criteria and standard severity assessment tools are needed to formulate specific treatment options and improve patient care.",

Six MPTP monkeys were repeatedly treated with l-Dopa to develop reproducible dyskinesias. AQW051 (2, 8, and 15\u00a0mg/kg) administered 1\u00a0h before l-Dopa treatment did not affect their parkinsonian scores or locomotor activity, but did significantly extend the duration of the l-Dopa antiparkinsonian response, by 30\u00a0min at the highest AQW051 dose (15\u00a0mg/kg). Dyskinesias were significantly reduced for the total period of l-Dopa effect following treatment with 15\u00a0mg/kg; achieving a reduction of 60% in median values. Significant reductions in 1\u00a0h peak dyskinesia scores and maximal dyskinesias were also observed with AQW051 (15\u00a0mg/kg). To understand the exposure\u2013effect relationship and guide dose selection in clinical trials, plasma concentration-time data for the 15\u00a0mg/kg AQW051 dose were collected from three of the MPTP monkeys in a separate pharmacokinetic experiment.

We evaluated the association of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and combinations of psychotropic drugs with all-cause mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and a matched group without PD.We identified 5861 PD patients and 31,395 control subjects matched by age, gender and marital status, and obtained register data on medication use and vital status between 1997 and 2007.All-cause mortality was significantly higher with the use of most groups of psychotropic medication in PD patients and controls. Hazard ratios were as follows for the medication types: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin-noradrenalin reuptake inhibitors, PD HR\u00a0=\u00a01.19, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04\u22121.36; Control HR\u00a0=\u00a01.77, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.64\u22121.91; benzodiazepines, PD HR\u00a0=\u00a01.17, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.99\u22121.38; Control HR\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.29\u22121.51; benzodiazepine-like drugs, PD HR\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.11\u22121.59; Control HR\u00a0=\u00a01.27, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.18\u22121.37; first-generation antipsychotics, PD HR\u00a0=\u00a01.89, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.42\u22122.53; Control HR\u00a0=\u00a02.12, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.82\u22122.47; second-generation antipsychotics, PD HR\u00a0=\u00a01.46, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.20\u22121.76; Control HR\u00a0=\u00a02.00, 95% CI 1.66\u22122.43; and combinations of these drugs compared with non-medicated PD patients and controls. Discontinuation of medication was associated with decreased mortality in both groups.The use of psychotropic medication in the elderly is associated with increased mortality, independent of concurrent neurodegeneration due to PD. Confounding by indication may partly explain the higher hazard ratios in medicated controls compared with medicated PD patients. Our findings indicate that neurodegeneration should not be a separate contraindication per se for the use of psychotropic drug in patients with PD, but its use should be based on careful clinical evaluation and follow-up.",

The aim of our study was to investigate the relationships among cognitive impairment, night-time sleep problems, daytime sleepiness, and fatigue across all severities of PD.We examined these non-motor problems using the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) in a study of 1319 PD patients drawn from three large cohort studies: the Parkinson's Progressive Markers Initiative, the Rush University PD Cognitive-Behavioral-Imaging study, and the Movement Disorder Society-Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Clinimetric testing program study, which spanned the gamut of disease, from early to advanced PD. Generalized linear mixed models with logit linking functions and covariates including study cohort, age, PD duration, and presence/absence of PD medications were used to examine relationships between these three non-motor symptoms and cognitive impairment.Of these three frequent, and often inter-twined, non-motor complications, greater daytime sleepiness and fatigue were associated with worse cognitive impairment across the full spectrum of PD (F[16,1158]\u00a0=\u00a02.40 and F[16,1158]\u00a0=\u00a03.45 respectively, p's\u00a0<\u00a00.0005), but an association with night-time sleep was not detected (p\u00a0=\u00a00.83).Given this association of daytime sleepiness and fatigue with cognitive impairment, clinical monitoring for these problems should be considered across all points in the PD spectrum, from early to more advanced disease.",

However, little is known about the diagnostic accuracy of these parkinsonian syndromes in nursing homes. We examined this issue in a large group of Dutch nursing home residents.Twelve large nursing home organizations in the Netherlands accounting for 100 nursing homes with a total population of 5480 residents participated. Residents with PD or atypical parkinsonism were identified according to their nursing home medical chart diagnosis. Additionally, local pharmacists provided a list of all residents using antiparkinson medication. We compared the admission diagnosis to a clinical diagnosis made in the study, based upon interview and detailed neurological examination by movement disorders experts. Diagnoses were based on accepted clinical criteria for PD and atypical parkinsonism.In the total population of 5480 residents, 258 had previously been diagnosed with a form of parkinsonism according to their medical record. In 53 of these residents (20.5%) we changed or rejected the diagnosis. Specifically, we found no parkinsonism in 22 of these 53 residents (8.5% of all patients with suspected parkinsonism). In the remaining 31 residents (12%), we established a new diagnosis within the parkinsonian spectrum.In a large population of Dutch nursing home residents, 20% of diagnoses within the parkinsonian spectrum were inaccurate. Almost 9% of residents had inadvertently received a diagnosis of parkinsonism. Better recognition of parkinsonism in nursing homes is important, because of the consequences for management and prognosis.",

With the instruction not to resist the imposed displacements, resistance to horizontal neck deflections was evaluated.Patients exhibited a torque offset (bias) in the direction of torticollis before stimulus application. While controls reduced and occasionally eliminated completely the initial resistance to head-to-trunk rotations, torque in patients increased throughout displacements. Change of resistance relative to baseline in patients was, however, symmetrical, i.e. independent of torticollis direction. Spontaneous torque fluctuations were significantly larger in patients. Strong correlations existed among these abnormal findings.Patients' ability to manipulate normal postural reactions to head-trunk rotations is impaired. The deficit is bilateral and correlates with the degree of abnormal posture.

Lateral habenula (LHb) has efferent projections that terminate in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and electrical stimulation of the LHb effectively suppresses the activity of dopamine-containing neurons in the SNpc. This study was aimed to investigate whether LHb lesions can ameliorate the syndromes of PD via affecting the activities of SNpc neurons in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced PD model rats.Concentrations of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the striatum, which is the area projected by the SNpc dopaminergic neurons were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with fluorescence detection. The immunohistochemical method was applied to detect the numbers of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells in the substantia nigra.The results showed that LHb lesions induced a significant reduction in apomorphine-induced rotational behavior. The DA, DOPAC and HVA levels in the striatum of PD model rats were increased by the LHb lesions.Therefore, we speculate that the LHb lesions induced a significant amelioration in motor disorders via increasing the DA levels in the striatum, which may lead to a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PD.",

     "abstract": "Longitudinal neuroimaging studies could provide insights into pathophysiology of cognitive impairment in PD. We examined the role of hippocampal atrophy and cerebral white matter disease as risk factors for mild cognitive impairment and dementia in PD.Prospective longitudinal study of patients with mild PD in a tertiary neurology center. All subjects underwent baseline MRI brain and had baseline and 6 monthly cognitive evaluations. Cognitive impairment was diagnosed based on the Movement Disorder Society Criteria. The predictive role of hippocampal volume and white matter hyperintensity at baseline on progression of cognitive impairment was studied.97 subjects with mean age 65.3 years, mean education of 10.3 years and mean Hoehn & Yahr of 1.9 were studied. Over 2 years, 16 subjects developed mild cognitive impairment and 8 subjects with mild cognitive impairment progressed to dementia. After adjusting for age and vascular risk factors, hippocampal volume was a significant predictor for mild cognitive impairment (OR 7.05, CI 1.5\u201334.1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and dementia (OR 7.03, CI 2.39\u201325.2; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). With Cox regression, hippocampal volume was a significant predictor for \u201ctime to cognitive impairment\u201d (HR 7.67; CI 3.47\u201316.95, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Difference between survival curves based on volume of white matter hyperintensity in predicting \u201ctime to mild cognitive impairment\u201d was significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0295).Hippocampal volume is a major factor predicting the development of mild cognitive impairment and dementia in PD. White matter hyperintensity also contributes to the longitudinal cognitive status in PD.",

     "abstract": "Pathological gambling (PG) is one of the most devastating non-motor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD). Neuroanatomical abnormalities in PD patients with PG are poorly understood.In the current study we investigated PD patients with and without PG using Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) and local Gyrification Index (lGI), two neuroimaging techniques useful for detecting complementary morphological metrics in the brain. Twelve PD patients with PG were compared to 12 clinically-matched PD patients without PG and 24 healthy controls.PD patients with PG showed grey matter volume loss specifically in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) when compared to patients without PG, with the atrophy of this region correlating with the increase of gambling symptoms (G-SAS). Surface-based analysis complemented this evidence revealing that the OFC in the PD patients with PG was also characterized by a reduced lGI. Moreover, when compared to controls, PD patients with PG showed a more widespread anatomical neurodegeneration involving several limbic regions such as: the OFC, cingulate cortex, inferior frontal cortex and insular cortex. Otherwise, demographically-/clinically-matched PD patients without PG did not display significant anatomical changes.Our study demonstrates that combined grey matter atrophy and reduced lGI in the OFC differentiates PD patients with PG from those without PG, suggesting that this cortical area may play a critical role in the development of this drug-induced behavioral disorder.",

We determined the frequency and relative risk of major GBA mutations in a large series of Italian patients with primary parkinsonism.We studied 2766 unrelated consecutive patients with clinical diagnosis of primary degenerative parkinsonism (including 2350 PD), and 1111 controls. The entire cohort was screened for mutations in GBA exons 9 and 10, covering approximately 70% of mutations, including the two most frequent defects, p.N370S and p.L444P.Four known mutations were identified in heterozygous state: 3 missense mutations (p.N370S, p.L444P, and p.D443N), and the splicing mutation IVS10+1G>T, which results in the in-frame exon-10 skipping. Molecular characterization of 2 additional rare variants, potentially interfering with splicing, suggested a neutral effect. GBA mutations were more frequent in PD (4.5%, RR\u00a0=\u00a07.2, CI\u00a0=\u00a03.3\u201315.3) and in Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) (13.8%, RR\u00a0=\u00a021.9, CI\u00a0=\u00a06.8\u201370.7) than in controls (0.63%). but not in the other forms of parkinsonism such as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP, 2%), and Corticobasal Degeneration (CBD, 0%).

The secondary aim was to explore whether regular exercise is associated with a slower decline of function, disease-related quality of life, and caregiver burden.The National Parkinson's Foundation (NPF) QII Registry data was used to analyze variables that correlate with levels of exercise in PD patients across disease severity. Subjects were categorized into three groups: non-exercisers (0\u00a0min/week), low exercisers (1\u2013150\u00a0min/week), and regular exercisers (>150\u00a0min/week). Health related outcomes, disease metrics, and demographic factors associated with exercise were examined using bivariate analyses. Multiple regression models controlled for disease duration, severity, and cognitive function. An exploratory analysis was completed on the association of baseline level of exercise with health outcomes at one year follow up.4866 subjects were included in the baseline analysis and 2252 subjects who had second visits were included in the longitudinal data. Regular exercisers at baseline were associated with better QOL, mobility, and physical function, less progression of disease, less caregiver burden and less cognitive decline one year later, after controlling for demographic and disease severity variables.This study provides important preliminary evidence of the beneficial effects of regular exercise in a large PD cohort.

     "abstract": "Multiple airway protective mechanisms are impacted with Parkinson's disease (PD), including swallowing and cough. Cough serves to eject material from the lower airways, and can be produced voluntarily (on command) and reflexively in response to aspirate material or other airway irritants. Voluntary cough effectiveness is reduced in PD however it is not known whether reflex cough is affected as well. The goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness between voluntary and reflex cough in patients with idiopathic PD.Twenty patients with idiopathic PD participated. Cough airflow data were recorded via facemask in line with a pneumotachograph. A side delivery port connected the nebulizer for delivery of capsaicin, which was used to induce cough. Three voluntary coughs and three reflex coughs were analyzed from each participant. A two-way repeated measures analysis of variance was used to compare voluntary versus reflex cough airflow parameters.Significant differences were found for peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) and cough expired volume (CEV) between voluntary and reflex cough. Specifically, both PEFR and CEV were reduced for reflex as compared to voluntary cough.Cough PEFR and CEV are indicative of cough effectiveness in terms of the ability to remove material from the lower airways. Differences between these two cough types likely reflect differences in the coordination of the respiratory and laryngeal subsystems. Clinicians should be aware that evaluation of cough function using voluntary cough tasks overestimates the PEFR and CEV that would be achieved during reflex cough in patients with PD.",

Early-morning off (EMO) periods in PD patients are known to be a cause of significant disability, in addition to having a negative impact on quality of life. Yet EMOs are poorly defined, particularly in relation to non-motor symptoms (NMS).This European, multicentre, observational study was undertaken to characterize the range and patterns of NMS that occur during EMO periods in a consecutive series of PD patients.The results demonstrate that EMO periods are common and occur in 59.7% of subjects across all disease stages in line with other reports. However, importantly, in 88.0% of those, EMOs were found to be associated with NMS. The predominant NMS associated with EMO were urinary urgency, anxiety, dribbling of saliva, pain, low mood, limb paresthesia and dizziness. The patterns of dopaminergic treatment being taken by patients in this study suggested that a prolonged-release or continuous drug delivery strategy can alleviate some NMS associated with EMO.In light of these findings it is suggested that greater awareness, recognition and appropriate treatment of EMO and NMS could improve the overall 24-h management of PD. An EMO-specific scale/questionnaire which captures both motor and NMS associated with EMO over the off time period is warranted.",

Previous evidence suggests that the PDQ-39 reflects at least 8 dimensions (i.e., Emotion, Cognitions, Mobility, etc). To date, little research has examined the external/convergent validity of the Cognitions and Emotional Well-being domains of the PDQ-39.A convenience sample of 303 PD patients underwent a comprehensive multi-domain neuropsychological evaluation, including tests of execution function, episodic verbal memory, processing speed, language and working memory, as well as completing measures of depression, apathy, state and trait anxiety and HRQoL (PDQ-39). Hierarchical regressions were conducted in order to examine the relationship between scores on neuropsychological tests and the Cognitions index, as well as mood measures and the Emotional Well-being index of the PDQ-39.Neuropsychological test performance did not account for a significant amount of variance in the PDQ-39 Cognitions index scores. Instead, it was depression that significantly contributed to the Cognitions index, above and beyond neuropsychological performance. The PDQ-39 Emotional Well-being index was also related to mood measures, primarily depression and trait anxiety.The PDQ-39 Cognition index may be more related to mood functioning, as opposed to cognitive functioning, and should not be considered a \u201cproxy\u201d for cognitive functioning.

The unit's core features were defined following consultation with patients and professionals: specially trained staff, ready availability of PD drugs, guidelines, and care led by a geriatrician with specialty PD training. Mandatory staff training comprised four 1\u00a0h sessions: PD symptoms; medications; therapy; communication and swallowing. Most medication was prescribed using an electronic Prescribing and Administration system (iSOFT) which provided accurate data on time of administration. We compared patient outcomes before and after introduction of the unit.The general ward care (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and the Specialist Parkinson's Unit care (n\u00a0=\u00a024) groups had similar baseline characteristics.

Two of these three siblings were examined in our clinic. DNA samples from the index case and his elder sister were subjected to homozygosity mapping and exomic sequencing.The index case had progressive speech problems, severe apathy, chorea, and tics at presentation and developed very mild parkinsonism and postural instability after 3 years. His sister had young-onset asymmetric tremor-dominant parkinsonism with some atypical features, such as early development of postural instability, tics, and tachyphemic speech. She died of an akinetic-rigid condition and had not developed chorea. A homozygous R498X mutation was found in both patients (NM_012179; chr22:31,224,440). This result was further confirmed by Sanger sequencing in both patients, their consanguineous parents, and their maternal grandfather; the latter three were found to be heterozygous for the mutation (c.C1492T; p.R498X).The family presented here broadens the clinical spectrum of parkinsonism to include tics and chorea, in addition to the parkinsonian-pyramidal phenotype, in connection with FBXO7 mutations and points to an intrafamilial phenotypic variation.",

While this intuitively may seem a plausible approach, it is uncertain if these rates are similar to those calculated from longitudinal data. The aim of this study is to examine if progression rates calculated according to both methods yield the same results.We calculated two progression rates in data from the PROPARK study: one where last follow-up SPES/SCOPA motor and activities-of-daily-living scores were divided by disease duration, and one in which baseline motor and activities-of-daily-living scores were subtracted from data collected at last follow-up, and where the difference was divided by the time that passed between both assessments. We subsequently calculated the rank order correlation between both approaches.We found that progression rates calculated from cross-sectional data are 1.5\u20132 times higher than those calculated from longitudinal data, and that the correlation between both methods is <0.50.Progression rates calculated from cross-sectional data not only overestimate actual progression, but also yield a different rank order.

Secondary outcome measures were quality of life as determined by the SF-36 questionnaire, time to achieve best possible benefit and DBS parameters that accounted for the best response. In patients with prominent concomitant cervical dystonia we also used the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS).GPi DBS improved BFM scores by 87.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.46%. Improvement in total severity scale of TWSTRS was 71.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.7%. Quality of life also remarkably improved as evidenced by 109.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a082.97 and 7.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a021.48% percent change in psychometrically-based physical component summary (PCS), and a mental component summary (MCS) score respectively.GPi DBS is a very effective treatment for adult-onset axial dystonia. Considering its refractoriness to medical therapy and significant impact on quality of life DBS should be considered for this disorder.",

     "abstract": "Diagnosis and treatment of tremor are largely based on clinical assessment. Whereas in some patients tremor may respond to dopaminergic treatment, in general l-Dopa response to tremor varies considerably. The aim of this study was to predict l-Dopa response by accelerometry.We included 60 tremor patients and measured harmonic oscillations by accelerometry. In addition to neurological assessment, we performed l-Dopa challenge tests and the individual tremor response was compared to the amount of harmonic oscillations.We found a strong correlation between harmonic oscillations and clinical l-Dopa response. Similarly, harmonic oscillations were significantly greater in patients with subjective tremor reduction upon l-Dopa administration.We conclude that harmonic oscillations are a measure for l-Dopa response to tremor irrespective of the underlying disease. Because of the observational character of the study, any causal relation remains speculative. Nevertheless, we propose a novel, non-invasive approach to predict l-Dopa response in tremor patients.",

Although the pathophysiological mechanism of FOG is unknown, previous studies have suggested that frontal dysfunction is associated with FOG. The Behavioral Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) battery, which is wide-ranging neurological battery composed of six subtests, evaluates frontal function and is more sensitive to executive dysfunction (ED) than other tools in PD patients. This is the first study to assess the relation between FOG in the \u2018on\u2019 state and frontal dysfunction evaluated using BADS.Subjects were 65 patients with PD. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to compare the age-controlled standardized BADS score, age, disease duration, Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, levodopa-equivalent daily dose, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score across patients with FOG (n\u00a0=\u00a043) and patients without FOG (n\u00a0=\u00a022). Score on each of the six BADS subtests were compared across patients with and without FOG using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test.Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that FOG was related to lower age-controlled standardized BADS score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and higher HY stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009) but not to disease duration, levodopa equivalent daily dose, or MMSE score. Among the six BADS subtests, score on the Zoo Map Test, which evaluates problem solving and planning, was lower in patients with FOG than in patients without FOG.These results support a relation between on-state FOG and frontal dysfunction in PD patients.",

The Movement Disorder Society criteria were used to define and classify PD-MCI.Participants with PD-MCI were significantly older than those with normal cognition, had more severe motor symptoms, scored higher for depression and had poorer quality of life. Logistic regression showed that mild cognitive impairment, independent of other factors, was an indicator of poorer QoL. Using cognitive performance 2.0 standard deviations (SD) below normative data as a cut-off to define PD-MCI, there was a significant difference in QoL scores between patients with PD-MCI and those classified as having normal cognition. Subjects with less severe mild cognitive impairment did not exhibit significant differences in QoL.PD-MCI is a significant, independent factor contributing to poorer QoL in patients with newly diagnosed PD. Those classified with greatest impairment (2.0 SD below normal values) have lower QoL. This has implications for clinical practice and future interventions targeting cognitive impairments.",

The aim of this study was to further explore the differences in local gray matter (GM) volume in patients with PD with and without FOG by using Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM).We enrolled 26 patients (7 women and 19 men) with a diagnosis of PD in stable treatment with dopaminergic therapy. Thirteen patients classified as FOG+ were matched with thirteen nonfreezer (FOG\u2212) PD patients. All 26 participants underwent a detailed neuropsychological assessment as well as a VBM analysis derived from T1 weighted 3T MRI.The patient groups did not significantly differ for age, disease duration, H&Y stage, UPDRS part-III or educational attainment. No significant differences of cognitive profile emerged. PD-FOG+ patients showed a pattern of relative GM atrophy in left posterior parietal gyrus compared with PD-FOG\u2212.Our results suggest that a specific pattern of cortical volume reduction involving posterior parietal cortex contributes to the occurrence of FOG in PD. These data agree with the growing body of evidence considering the parietal posterior cortex as an associative area involved in spatial control of motor behavior, partaking in response selection to sensory evaluation.",

Additional articles of interest were identified from reference lists of included publications. Relevant clinical abstracts from Movement Disorder Society meetings were included.16 preclinical studies of metabotropic glutamate 5-receptor antagonists in animal models of l-Dopa-induced dyskinesias and 7 clinical studies in patients with Parkinson's disease and l-Dopa-induced dyskinesias were included. Anti-dyskinetic effects of metabotropic glutamate 5-receptor blockade (MPEP, MTEP, fenobam, or MRZ-8676) were reported in dyskinetic 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rats. Studies in MPTP-lesioned non-human primates reported anti-dyskinetic effects of MPEP, MTEP, fenobam and mavoglurant (AFQ056). Three randomized, double-blind clinical trials reported anti-dyskinetic efficacy of mavoglurant, without effects on anti-parkinsonian therapy, with dizziness the most common adverse event. However, two further studies failed to demonstrate significant anti-dyskinetic efficacy. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety study of dipraglurant (ADX48621) demonstrated tolerability and positive exploratory secondary outcomes of reduced dyskinesia.Animal model studies provide evidence for anti-dyskinetic efficacy of metabotropic glutamate 5-receptor antagonists. Initial proof-of-concept clinical trials of mavoglurant and dipraglurant showed positive results; anti-dyskinetic efficacy was not supported by two recent mavoglurant trials. Further evaluations of optimal dosage and long-term efficacy and safety of metabotropic glutamate 5-receptor antagonists for management of l-Dopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease are required.",

     "abstract": "Parkinsonism in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) was first described in families with mutations in the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and progranulin (PRGN) genes. Since then, mutations in several other genes have been identified for FTD with parkinsonism, including chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9ORF72), chromatin modifying protein 2B (CHMP2B), valosin-containing protein (VCP), fused in sarcoma (FUS) and transactive DNA-binding protein (TARDBP). The clinical presentation of patients with familial forms of FTD with parkinsonism is highly variable. The parkinsonism seen in FTD patients is usually characterized by akinetic-rigid syndrome and is mostly associated with the behavioral variant of FTD (bvFTD); however, some cases may present with classical Parkinson's disease. In other cases, atypical parkinsonism resembling progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal syndrome (CBS) has also been described. Although rare, parkinsonism in FTD may coexist with motor neuron disease. Structural neuroimaging, which is crucial for the diagnosis of FTD, shows characteristic patterns of brain atrophy associated with specific mutations. Structural neuroimaging is not helpful in distinguishing among patients with parkinsonian features. Furthermore, dopaminergic imaging that shows nigrostriatal neurodegeneration in FTD with parkinsonism cannot discriminate parkinsonian syndromes that arise from different mutations. Generally, parkinsonism in FTD is levodopa unresponsive, but there have been cases where a temporary benefit has been reported, so dopaminergic treatment is worth trying, especially, when motor and non-motor manifestations can cause significant problems with daily functioning. In this review, we present an update on the clinical and genetic correlations of FTD with parkinsonism.",

QoL was measured with the generic EuroQoL 5-Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D) and the disease-specific Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39). Multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to test the associations of motor complication subtypes with QoL.Thirty-three percent of the patients (varying from 23% in Italy to 58% in France) suffered from motor complications, either a single subtype or a combination of different subtypes. On-off fluctuations were associated with a 7.1 percentage point decrease in the EQ-5D (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a 3.6 percentage point deterioration in the PDQ-39 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Dyskinesias were not seen to affect global QoL scores, but had detrimental effects on the PDQ-39 dimensions activities of daily living, cognitions, stigma, and bodily discomfort. Patients from Spain, Italy, and France had lower global QoL scores in the multivariable analyses than patients from Germany and the UK.Motor complications, primarily on-off fluctuations, may impact QoL in PD patients.

Higher baseline Postural-Instability-and-Gait-Difficulty scores were also associated with an increased risk of dementia, whereas no effect of tremor severity was found. These findings largely corresponded with the variables that were associated with the presence of dementia at baseline.

Optimized VBM was applied to the MRI brain images in 11 PD patients with RBD (PD-RBD), 11 PD patients without RBD (PD) and 18 age-and sex-matched controls. To corroborate VBM findings we used automated volumetric method (FreeSurfer) to quantify subcortical brain regions volumes. Patients and controls also underwent DAT-SPECT and cardiac MIBG scintigraphies.The VBM analysis showed markedly reduced gray matter volume in the right thalamus of PD-RBD patients in comparison with PD patients and controls. Automatic thalamic segmentation in PD-RBD patients showed a bilaterally reduced thalamic volume as compared with PD patients or controls. All PD patients (with and without RBD) showed a reduced tracer uptake on DAT-SPECT and cardiac MIBG scintigraphies as compared to controls.Our findings suggest that the presence of RBD symptoms in PD patients is associated with a reduced thalamic volume suggesting a pathophysiologic role of the thalamus in the complex circuit causing RBD.",

In the past 5 years several placebo or sham-controlled trials with varying results have been published.The aim of this systematic literature review is to summarize and qualitatively analyze the published studies on this matter.Studies published up to December 2013 were found via a systematic comprehensive electronic database search using PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library. Two reviewers independently assessed the studies using strict inclusion criteria.Twelve studies were included and qualitatively analyzed using critical appraisal items. The review includes rehabilitative (exercises, electrical stimulation, bolus modification etc.) and pharmacologic treatment. Some well-designed controlled trials were included. However, none of the included studies fulfilled all criteria for external and internal validity. A meta-analysis was not carried out as most of the studies were not of sufficient quality to warrant doing so.Expiratory Muscle Strength Training (EMST) and Video-Assisted Swallowing Therapy (VAST) may be effective dysphagia treatments solely or in addition to dopaminergic therapy for PD. However, these preliminary results warrant further investigation concerning their clinical applicability, and further research should be based on randomized sham-controlled trials to determine the effectiveness and long-term effects of different therapies for dysphagia in PD.",

However, differentiating between these conditions can be challenging on a clinical ground, especially in the early stages. We therefore performed a review to ascertain whether assessment of non-motor symptoms, or use of ancillary investigations, namely dopamine transporter imaging, transcranial sonography of the substantia nigra, and scintigraphy for myocardial sympathetic innervation, can be recommended to distinguish between these conditions.Among non-motor symptoms, there is evidence that hyposmia can differentiate between patients with \u201cpure\u201d drug-induced parkinsonism and those with degenerative parkinsonism unmasked by an anti-dopaminergic drug. However, several issues, including smoking history and cognitive functions, can influence smell function assessment. Higher diagnostic accuracy has been demonstrated for dopamine transporter imaging. Finally, preliminary evidence exists for sympathetic cardiac scintigraphy to predict dopaminergic pathway abnormalities and to differentiate between drug-induced parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease.Imaging of the dopaminergic pathway seems to be the only, reasonably available, technique to aid the differential diagnosis between drug-induced parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease.",

No differences among the four groups were detected during walking. When cognitive performances during walking were compared to the performance at rest, there was a significant decline of verbal episodic memory task (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test) in patients without freezing and with levodopa-responsive freezing. Interestingly, walking improved performance on the phonological fluency task in patients with levodopa-resistant freezing (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).Compared to patients without freezing, patients with levodopa-resistant freezing perform worse when tested while seated in tasks of phonological verbal fluency. Surprisingly, gait was associated with a paradoxical improvement of phonological verbal fluency in the patients with levodopa-resistant freezing whilst walking determined a worsening of episodic memory in the other patient groups.",

Parkinsonism was diagnosed if patients had two or more cardinal motor signs. Patients had yearly follow-up to improve diagnostic accuracy.Incidence rates using the diagnosis by established research criteria at latest follow-up were calculated for each condition by age, gender, and socioeconomic status.Of 377 patients identified at baseline with possible or probable parkinsonism, 363 were confirmed as incident patients after median follow-up of 26 months (mean age 74.8 years, SD 9.8; 61% men). The crude annual incidence was 3.2 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.2\u20134.3) for VP, 1.7 per 100,000 (95% CI 1.0\u20132.4) for PSP, and 1.4 per 100,000 (95% CI 0.8\u20132.1) for MSA-P.

The subjects' voice samples were analyzed for acoustic parameters, namely formant frequencies of the adjoining vowels, voice onset time (VOT), and intensities using spectrogram. Correlation of BOLD activation in different brain areas with acoustic parameters was evaluated.Voice intensity was significantly lowered, while VOTs were delayed in these patients as compared to healthy controls. All acoustic parameters were significantly affected for nasal consonants.

However, recent findings suggest that gray matter atrophy also contributes to NPS in PD. We contrast PD patients with different levels of NPS, who are well-matched for dopaminergic medication levels and disease stage, to identify the fronto-striatal gray matter atrophy areas associated with NPS in PD.Fifty mild, non-demented PD patients were included. We median-split the group via a neuropsychiatric screening tool (Cambridge Behavioural Inventory-Revised), which resulted in higher vs. lower NPS groups (n\u00a0=\u00a025 in each group). Using T1 brain scans acquired on a 3 Tesla MRI scanner, voxel-based morphometry analysis was applied to characterize the pattern of fronto-striatal gray matter atrophy associated with elevated NPS.We found that the higher NPS group was characterized by greater atrophy in the prefrontal cortex, but not striatal areas. This was further corroborated by a post-hoc analysis cross-correlating the severity of NPS with gray matter loss across the whole PD group, which revealed that atrophy in the orbitofrontal cortex and frontal pole was specifically associated with elevated NPS.Prefrontal cortex atrophy in PD has an additional effect to dopamine replacement therapy on the generation of NPS in these patients. These findings are an important step towards the delineation of atrophy vs. neurochemical imbalance in PD, and the results emphasize the importance of considering interactions between prefrontal atrophy and neurochemical dysfunction in the genesis of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD.",

Furthermore, we investigated the contribution of different sensory modalities and dopaminergic medication.Seventeen PD patients (8 with PS, 9 without PS) and 18 healthy controls were tested. The SVV was assessed in a seated, in a lateral horizontal and \u2013 in PS patients \u2013 in a seated manually rectified position. Frame and moving-stimulus-patterns were used to test visual dependency. In PD and PS patients all trials were conducted in dopaminergic \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d.When seated, SVV values on PD in \u201con\u201d and PS in \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d differed significantly from controls. This difference remained in PS patients after manual rectification in \u201coff\u201d. The SVV in a lateral horizontal position was not significantly different between the three groups. When inclined, visual dependency was higher in PD \u201coff\u201d than in controls.Both PS and PD patients showed SVV deviations compared to healthy controls. These cannot be explained by their intrinsic lateral deviation in PS patients. They must be secondary to either a primary perceptual dysfunction or alterations of internal models of verticality due to re-weighting of perceptual afferences.",

A diaphragmatic pacemaker was implanted in the proband from the Colombian family to treat her respiratory insufficiency. Dopaminergic therapy was initiated in probands from two families.Besides the probands, 17 symptomatic relatives from all families were identified. The cardinal signs of Perry syndrome were present in all three probands with symptomatic disease onset in their fifth or sixth decade of life. Parkinsonism was moderate with a partial response to dopaminergic treatment. All affected persons but two died of respiratory insufficiency. The proband from the Colombian family is alive most likely due to early diagnosis and implantation of a diaphragmatic pacemaker. Two-and-a-half-year follow-up examination has revealed that the diaphragmatic pacemaker is optimally functioning without any major complications. In the Colombian and US families, the DCTN1 p.G71R and in the New Zealand family the DCTN1 p.Y78C mutations were identified. In functional assays, both mutations altered microtubule binding consistent with a pathogenic role.Perry syndrome is a rare condition, but new cases are expected to be diagnosed worldwide. Early diagnosis prevents life-threatening acute respiratory failure. Diaphragmatic pacemakers should be considered as an effective symptomatic treatment option.",

All available clinical records and archived surface electromyographical data for these patients were reviewed and analyzed.32 patients with OM (mean age 74 years), 8 with primary OT (mean age 71), and 55 with neither orthostatic hyperkinesia (NOH) (mean age 68) were identified. All OT patients and 84% each of OM and NOH patients complained of involuntary leg movements while standing, e.g., \u201cshaking,\u201d \u201ctrembling,\u201d or \u201cjerking.\u201d All OM and OT patients experienced symptomatic and electrophysiological abatement or attenuation of their leg hyperkinesias by leaning forward onto an object while standing.OM has some similarities to OT, including causing \u201cshaky legs\u201d subjectively in standing older patients. Novel data from this work include that, as in OT, OM essentially abates when patients remove their weight from their legs. This shared isometric phenomenon may reflect that OT and OM are on a pathophysiological continuum. Further, many patients who complain of their legs \u201cshaking\u201d while standing may have neither OT nor OM. Surface electromyography may be a useful adjunct in extrapolating patients complaining of \u201cshaky legs.\u201d",

If a relationship were established, dopamine restoring neuroprotective treatments could be used to decrease mortality. The objective of this study was to determine whether the initial degree of hypodopaminergic defect, as measured by 6-[18F]fluoro-L-DOPA positron emission tomography (FDOPA-PET), can predict patient survival.The study population included a cohort of 88 recently diagnosed and untreated patients with PD who were clinically examined and scanned with FDOPA-PET between the years 1998 and 2000. The date of exit for the survival analysis was in April 2013 with a follow-up interval of 13\u201315 years. The survival model included FDOPA uptake, age, sex and symptom severity as explaining factors. Death certificates of the patients were obtained, and causes of death were analyzed.Mortality rate was 56.8%. Although higher age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and greater motor symptom severity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were associated with increased mortality, there was no association between survival and FDOPA uptake in any striatal subregion (p\u00a0>\u00a00.48).Unlike age and early motor symptom severity, dopamine synthesis capacity, as measured with PET, does not predict survival in PD.",

Of these, eighteen PSP patients were also investigated by electrical nystagmography to determine horizontal ocular motor deficits. Statistical parametric mapping analyses were performed to correlate regional neuronal activity with ocular motor functions.In categorical comparisons, patients with downward gaze palsy showed a significantly reduced glucose metabolism in bilateral anterior cingulate gyrus and right lingual gyrus compared to those without downward gaze palsy. Maximum velocity of horizontal saccades was positively correlated with glucose metabolism of the rostral vermis and lingual gyrus; regional metabolism of oculomotor vermis was associated with peak velocity of the optokinetic reflex. Analysis of smooth pursuit eye movement amplitude and peak velocity of corrective saccades showed positive correlation with metabolism in bilateral inferior parietal lobe and inferior part of the frontal eye field. All paradigms of smooth pursuit showed positive association with glucose metabolism in V5.Ocular motor functions in PSP are correlated with neuronal activity in distinct anatomical regions. These include the anterior cingulate gyrus (downward gaze palsy), rostral cerebellum (saccades), oculomotor vermis (optokinetic reflex) and inferior parietal as well as temporal regions and frontal eye field (smooth pursuit). These findings provide a deeper insight into the pathophysiology of PSP-associated ocular motor abnormalities.",

In particular, we investigated gender-related differences in motor and non-motor symptoms in the LRRK2 population.2976 unrelated consecutive Italian patients with degenerative Parkinsonism were screened for mutations on exon 41 (G2019S, I2020T) and a subgroup of 1190 patients for mutations on exon 31 (R1441C/G/H). Demographic and clinical features were compared between LRRK2-carriers and non-carriers, and between male and female LRRK2 mutation carriers.LRRK2 mutations were identified in 40 of 2523 PD patients (1.6%) and not in other primary parkinsonian syndromes. No major clinical differences were found between LRRK2-carriers and non-carriers. We found a novel I2020L missense variant, predicted to be pathogenic. Female gender was more common amongst carriers than non-carriers (57% vs. 40%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), without any gender-related difference in clinical features. Family history of PD was more common in women in the whole PD group, regardless of their LRRK2 status.PD patients with LRRK2 mutations are more likely to be women, suggesting a stronger genetic load compared to idiopathic PD. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether there is a different effect of gender on the balance between genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of PD.",

     "abstract": "Current concepts regarding the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease support a model whereby environmental factors conspire with a permissive genetic background to initiate the disease. The identity of the responsible environmental trigger has remained elusive. There is incontrovertible evidence that aggregation of the neuronal protein alpha-synuclein is central to disease pathogenesis. A novel hypothesis of Parkinson's pathogenesis, articulated by Braak and colleagues, implicates a pathogen acting in the olfactory mucosa and gastrointestinal tract as the inciting agent. In this point-of-view article, we hypothesize that \u03b1-synuclein aggregation in Parkinson's disease is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced autoimmune phenomenon. Specifically, we have shown evidence for molecular mimicry between the C-terminal region of \u03b1-synuclein and a repeat region in the latent membrane protein 1 encoded by EBV. We hypothesize that, in genetically-susceptible individuals, anti-EBV latent membrane protein antibodies targeting the critical repeat region cross react with the homologous epitope on \u03b1-synuclein and induce its oligomerization. Consistent with the Braak's proposed pattern of spread, we contend that axon terminals in the lamina propria of the gut are among the initial targets, with subsequent spread of pathology to the CNS. While at this time, we can only provide evidence from the literature and preliminary findings from our own laboratory, we hope that our hypothesis will stimulate the development of tractable experimental systems that can be exploited to test it. Further support for an EBV-induced immune pathogenesis for Parkinson's disease could have profound therapeutic implications.",

The pathophysiology of RLS is still unknown and its prevalence is influenced by ethnicity, age, and gender. RLS is divided into two types by etiology: primary or idiopathic and secondary. Primary RLS is strongly influenced by a genetic component while secondary RLS is caused by other associated conditions such as end-stage renal disease or peripheral neuropathy. Another common condition associated with RLS is pregnancy. The prevalence of RLS during pregnancy is two to three times higher than in the normal population and is influenced by the trimester and the number of parity. The main mechanisms that may contribute to the pathophysiology of RLS during pregnancy are hormonal changes and iron and folate status. Standard medications for treating RLS during pregnancy are not established. Most medications have been used according to the evidence from non-pregnant patients. Therefore, consideration of the medical treatment for treating RLS during pregnancy should be balanced between the benefit of relieving the symptoms and maternal and fetal risk. In general, the prognosis of RLS during pregnancy is good and symptoms are usually relieved after delivery.",

Clinical features or tests that distinguish degenerative from pharmacologic Parkinsonism are needed.We performed a retrospective case-control study of 97 drug-induced Parkinsonism subjects and 97 age-matched patients with Parkinson's disease. We compared the frequency of subjective motor and non-motor complaints, objective motor findings (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III) and, where available, objective olfactory tests. We also performed a nested case-control study wherein we compared these same features between drug-induced Parkinsonism patients based on whether or not they recovered after changing the offending agent.Non-motor symptoms including constipation and sexual dysfunction were more common in Parkinson's disease than in drug-induced Parkinsonism. While total motor scores were similar between groups, Postural Instability-Gait Difficulty scores were also higher in Parkinson's disease. Features that were significantly different or showed a trend towards significance in both comparisons included subjective loss of facial expression, dream-enactment behavior, autonomic complaints and Postural Instability-Gait Difficulty scores. Hyposmia was more common in Parkinson's disease and was strongly predictive of persistent drug-induced Parkinsonism after therapy change (odds ratio 30.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.5\u2013500, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).A constellation of motor and non-motor features may differentiate unmasked Parkinson's disease from drug-induced Parkinsonism.

Using an infrared based eye tracker and a magnetic head tracker, we reported that ocular tremor was recordable in PD subjects with no apparent head tremor. However, other investigators suggest that the ocular tremor may represent either transmitted appendicular tremor or subclinical head tremor inducing the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The present study aimed to further investigate the origin of ocular tremor in PD.Eye movements were recorded in 8 PD subjects both head free, and with full head restraint by means of a head holding device and a dental impression bite plate. Head movements were recorded independently using both a high sensitivity tri-axial accelerometer and a magnetic tracking system, each synchronized to the eye tracker.Ocular tremor was observed in all 8 PD subjects and was not influenced by head free and head fixed conditions. Both magnetic tracking and accelerometer recordings supported that the ocular tremor was fully independent of head position.The present study findings support our initial findings that ocular tremor is a fundamental feature of PD unrelated to head movements. Although the utility of ocular tremor for diagnostic purposes requires validation, current findings in large cohorts of PD subjects suggest\u00a0its potential as a reliable clinical biomarker.",

Their disorder was characterized by neurological examination, MRI, electroneurography, electromyography, MIBG-scintigraphy, and tilt-testing.The disorder presented as a balance and gait disturbance starting between 16 and 47 years of age. Cerebellar ataxia progressed slowly over the course of decades, and MRI showed mild to moderate cerebellar atrophy. Sensory axonal polyneuropathy was the most prominent additional feature and occurred in all patients examined. Autonomic neuropathy caused pronounced orthostatic dysregulation in at least four patients. Several affected members showed muscle wasting, and mild upper or lower motor neuron signs were documented. Patients had no nystagmus but slow or hypometric horizontal saccades and ocular motor apraxia. Cognition remained unimpaired, and there were no non-neurological disease manifestations. The disorder affected men and women in successive generations in a pattern compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance without evidence of anticipation. A second family where 7 members had very similar symptoms was identified and its origin traced back to the same village in southern Sweden as that of the first family's ancestors. All relevant known genetic causes of cerebellar ataxia were excluded by a novel next-generation sequencing approach.We present two probably related Swedish families with a characteristic and novel clinical syndrome of cerebellar ataxia and sensory polyneuropathy. The study serves as a basis for the mapping of the underlying genetic cause.",

After an observation period of >1.5 year, the patients were clinically diagnosed with Parkinson's disease (PD; n\u00a0=\u00a030), multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism (MSA-P; n\u00a0=\u00a010), or progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS; n\u00a0=\u00a013). The signal intensity of the lateral, central, and medial parts of the SNc and the LC were measured and the contrast ratios (CR) against adjacent white-matter structures was calculated.The CR of the lateral SNc was lower in the PD and MSA-P groups than in the PSPS and control groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001\u20130.05). The CR of the LC was lower in the PD group than in the other groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001\u20130.05). Sensitivity and specificity of the CRs for discriminating PD from MSA-P was 60% and 90%, respectively, those for PD/PSPS were 63\u201388% and 77\u201392%, respectively, and those for MSA-P/PSPS were 80% and 85%, respectively. These properties were comparable or better to MIBG scintigraphy.Neuromelanin-sensitive MRI can depict differences in signal intensity of the lateral SNc and the LC among the parkinsonism disorders at their early stages.",

     "abstract": "The pathogenesis of visual hallucinations (VHs) in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) has been considered multifactorial. In the pathophysiology of VHs a combination of impaired visual processing and attention has been reported. Imaging studies evidenced a role of the primary visual system and visual association areas as well as a dysfunctional activation of frontal areas in the occurrence of VHs. Due to the functional connections between basal ganglia and frontal areas, a role of basal ganglia and of the fronto-striatal circuits in the pathogenesis of VHs may be postulated. Aim of this study is to unveil whether a presynaptic dopamine deficiency at baseline may predict the development of VHs.A group of 18 non demented PD patients with VHs was matched with 18 non demented PD patients without VHs as regards age of onset of disease, disease duration and severity and levodopa equivalent dose. We retrospectively analyzed the 123I-FP CIT SPECT performed on the two groups at the onset of their disease. The striatal uptake values in the two groups were examined, in order to evaluate nigrostriatal differences between the groups with different behavioral phenotype.The group of patients with VHs had a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in right caudate uptake values at baseline when compared with patients without VHs. No significant differences were found between the groups regarding left caudate and putaminal uptake values.The frontal impairment reported in PD patients with VHs may be due to a right caudate dysfunction, as it is connected to the frontal brain areas via neuronal loops.",

This is associated with excessive sustained (tonic) or intermittent (phasic) muscle activity instead of the muscle atonia normally seen during REM sleep. We examined characteristics of manually-quantitated surface EMG activity in PD to ascertain whether the extent of muscle activity during REM sleep is associated with specific clinical features and measures of disease severity.In a convenience sample of outpatients with idiopathic PD, REM sleep behavior disorder was diagnosed based on clinical history and polysomnogram, and severity was measured using the RBD sleep questionnaire. Surface EMG activity in the mentalis, extensor muscle group of the forearms, and anterior tibialis was manually quantitated. Percentage of REM time with excessive tonic or phasic muscle activity was calculated and compared across PD and RBD characteristics.Among 65 patients, 31 had confirmed RBD. In univariate analyses, higher amounts of surface EMG activity were associated with longer PD disease duration (srho\u00a0=\u00a00.34; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and greater disease severity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In a multivariate regression model, surface EMG activity was significantly associated with RBD severity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) after adjustment for age, PD disease duration, PD severity and co-morbid sleep abnormalities.Surface EMG activity during REM sleep was associated with severity of both PD and RBD. This measure may be useful as a PD biomarker and, if confirmed, may aid in determining which PD patients warrant treatment for their dream enactment to reduce risk of injury.",

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the relationship between serum UA and non-motor symptoms (NMS) in de novo PD.Serum UA was measured in consecutively recruited, early drug-na\u00efve PD patients. Exclusion criteria were: treatment with UA modifying drugs; current smoking status; metabolic or cardiac morbidity. All patients completed the NMS Questionnaire (NMSQuest). The relationship between UA levels and NMSQuest domains was explored by logistic regression, subsequently adjusted for age, gender, disease duration (months since reported motor onset) UPDRS part III, H&Y scale, and MMSE. Regression analysis studied the overall relationship between UA levels and total NMS score, and was subsequently adjusted for age, gender, disease duration UPDRS part III, H&Y scale and MMSE.Eighty PD patients were recruited. At logistic regression, higher UA levels were related to lower involvement of Attention/Memory (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), Cardiovascular (0.009) and Sleep (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) domains of NMSQuest.

Lower UA was related to higher NMSQuest total score and in particular to Attention/Memory, Cardiovascular and Sleep domains. Thus, UA seems to be a major candidate to be a valuable biomarker of such early features of PD as NMS.",

This study investigated the effects of a cognitive task on the occurrence of falls and FoG when subjects with PD step in response to a postural perturbation.Ten subjects with PD and a history of FoG as well as 10 age-matched subjects without PD stepped in response to large, backward displacements of the support surface, with and without performing a fluency task of listing items in a category. Subjects with PD performed the task in the \u201coff\u201d and \u201con\u201d dopaminergic medication states. We recorded the percentage of trials with FoG (a lack of step in response to the perturbation), foot-lift latencies, and trials with falls into a safety harness.Dual tasking significantly increased the incidence of falls in people with PD, but subjects without PD did not fall in any condition. Dual tasking did not significantly increase trials without steps or foot-lift latencies. Falls were often coincident with a lack of step (FoG) in the single-task condition, but the increased falls with dual tasking occurred on trials with steps. Levodopa tended to decrease FoG and falls with or without dual tasking. However, medication did not significantly alter the effects of dual tasking on FoG or falls.For people with PD and FoG, forward falls may not always be caused by FoG, particularly under attention-distracting conditions.",

To gain more insight in genetic risk factors in dystonia we used a pathway sequence approach in patients with an extreme dystonia phenotype (n\u00a0=\u00a026). We assessed all coding and non-coding variants in candidate genes in D1-like subclass of dopamine receptor genes (DRD1, DRD5) and the synaptic vesicle pathway linked to torsinA (TOR1A, STON2, SNAPIN, KLC1 and THAP1), spanning 96\u00a0Kb.Two rare missense variants in DRD1 were found: c.68G>A(p.Arg23His) in the screening group and c.776C>A(p.Ser259Tyr) in an additional screen of 15 selected dystonia patients. Genetic burden analysis of DRD1 rare variants in patients (4.8%) versus European American controls from ESP (0.72%) reveals an OR 5.35 (95% CI 1.29\u201323.1). No rare missense SNVs in the synaptic vesicle pathway were found. Sequencing of TOR1A showed variant enrichment in haplotype 2, possibly accountable for contradictive results in previous association studies. Two new rare SNVs were detected in THAP1, including a nonsense mutation (p.Gln167Ter) and a splice site variant (c.72-1G>A). Screening for rare SNV of candidate pathways in a phenotype extreme population appears to be a promising alternative method to identify genetic risk factors in complex disorders like primary torsion dystonia.

We investigated the mechanism of PPH and compared it with that of orthostatic hypotension (OH).The subjects were 37 patients with de novo PD and 10 healthy age-matched controls. We studied changes in blood pressure (BP), plasma norepinephrine concentrations (NE), plasma insulin, plasma glucose concentrations during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (75-g OGTT). Changes in BP and NE were also examined with head-up tilt-table testing (HUT).The maximum fall in systolic BP (SBP) on 75-g OGTT (\u22bfSBPPPH) significantly correlated with that on HUT (r\u00a0=\u00a00.359, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Clinical characteristics, including the presence of constipation, did not differ significantly between patients with and those without PPH.In PD, systemic sympathetic denervation, impaired baroreflex-cardiovagal gain, and insufficiency of compensatory sympathetic nervous activation including lack of baroreflex-sympathoneural gain for postprandial splanchnic vessel pooling seem to be associated with PPH. Systemic sympathetic denervation and baroreflex failure seem to contribute to both pronounced morbidity and the development of PPH and OH.",

Actigraphy uses periods of immobility as surrogate markers of nighttime sleep but there are no examples of its use in assessing EDS of PD.

High Epworth Sleepiness Scores (ESS) were associated with a proportion of time immobile (PTI) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01 Mann\u2013Whitney U). The median PTI between 0900 and 1800\u00a0h w in 30 age matched control subjects was 2%, representing 10\u00a0min and PTI at or above the 75th percentile (5% or 27\u00a0min) was taken as a high level. PD patients had higher PTI (median 4.8%) than controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, Mann\u2013Whitney U). PD subjects with a high PTI had more bradykinesia, less dyskinesia and higher PDQ39 scores than those with low PTI. There was no relationship between PTI and dose or type of PD medications. However, in 53% of subjects, PTI increased in the 30\u201360\u00a0min\u00a0after levodopa confirming that in some subjects levodopa results in increased sleepiness. In summary, immobility is a surrogate marker of daytime sleep in PD, confirmed by correlation with PSG and ESS. PD subjects measured this way are more likely to be sleepy and sleepy PD subjects are more likely to be bradykinetic and have a higher PDQ39. Levodopa leads to an increase in sleepiness in more than half of subjects post dosing.",

The objective of this study is to determine the reliability and responsiveness of a portable kinematic system for quantifying PD motor deficits as compared to clinical ratings.Eighteen PD patients with subthalamic nucleus deep-brain stimulation (DBS) performed three tasks for evaluating resting tremor, postural tremor, and finger-tapping speed, amplitude, and rhythm while wearing a wireless motion-sensor unit (Kinesia) on the more-affected index finger. These tasks were repeated three times with DBS turned off and at each of 10 different stimulation amplitudes chosen to yield small changes in treatment response. Each task performance was video-recorded for subsequent clinician rating in blinded, randomized order. Test\u2013retest reliability was calculated as intraclass correlation (ICC) and sensitivity was calculated as minimal detectable change (MDC) for each DBS amplitude.ICCs for Kinesia were significantly higher than those for clinician ratings of finger-tapping speed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), amplitude (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and rhythm (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but were not significantly different for evaluations of resting or postural tremor. Similarly, Kinesia scores yielded a lower MDC as compared with clinician scores across all finger-tapping subscores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but did not differ significantly for resting and postural tremor.The Kinesia portable kinematic system can provide greater test\u2013retest reliability and sensitivity to change than conventional clinical ratings for measuring bradykinesia, hypokinesia, and dysrhythmia in PD patients.",

To investigate this issue, the current study evaluated motor, cognitive, affective and autonomic features as well as REM sleep behavior disorder in Parkinson's disease patients in the early stages of the condition.Thirty-eight freezers and fifty-three non-freezers with disease duration of less than five years and a Hoehn and Yahr stage of less than three were included in this study. The groups were matched on a number of key disease features including age, disease duration, motor severity and dopamine dose equivalence. Furthermore, patients were assessed on measures of motor, cognitive, affective and autonomic features, as well as REM sleep behavior disorder.Compared to non-freezers, patients with freezing of gait had significantly more non-tremor symptoms and a selective impairment on executive functions, such as set-shifting ability and working memory. Freezers and non-freezers did not differ on measures of tremor, autonomic function, REM sleep behavior disorder, mood or more general cognition.These results suggest the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying freezing of gait in the early clinical stages of Parkinson's disease are likely to be related to specific changes in the frontostriatal pathways rather than being due to brainstem or more diffuse neuropathology.",

Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD advised to start antiparkinsonian medication in the previous 5 years were invited to complete a questionnaire in three centers located in North America and Europe. An electronic online survey was sent to physicians through the mailing list of the Movement Disorder Society. 469 participants (201 PD patients, 268 physicians). 40.2% (n\u00a0=\u00a082) of the patients reported reluctance to start medication, but 88.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a0234/264) of the physicians estimated that \u226420% of their patients with PD had been reluctant to start medication. The most common reasons reported by patients were the fear of side effects (n\u00a0=\u00a035, 55.6%), followed by non-acceptance of diagnosis (n\u00a0=\u00a023, 36.5%); fear of a temporally limited benefit was more commonly selected by physicians (n\u00a0=\u00a092/267, 34.5%). Patients indicated reluctance to start DAs more frequently compared with L-DOPA (OR: 2.22, 95% CI: 1.30, 9.03; p\u00a0=\u00a00.013) while physicians perceived L-DOPA to be associated with more reluctance (OR: 4.7, 95% CI: 3.41; 6.59; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Patients with PD and physicians have a different perspective on the issue of reluctance to start medication. There is a need to bring physicians and patients with PD closer to a shared vision of the problem reluctance to start medication.",

     "abstract": "Survival in patients with Parkinson's disease is reduced as compared to the general population. We aimed to identify motor and non-motor features that predict mortality in Parkinson's disease.A broad range of motor and non-motor features were assessed in a hospital-based cohort of 414 patients with Parkinson's disease, who underwent five annual follow-up examinations including vital status assessment. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazards regression analysis was used to evaluate the association between baseline characteristics and mortality risk. Stepwise regression with backward elimination was carried out to determine the best model to predict mortality in Parkinson's disease.After a mean follow-up period of 4.3 years, 49 (11.8%) patients had died. In the stepwise regression model, predictors of mortality in Parkinson's disease were higher age, male sex, cognitive impairment, higher postural instability gait disorder score, and the presence of psychotic symptoms.Higher age, male sex, cognitive impairment, higher postural instability gait disorder score, and the presence of psychotic symptoms are independent predictors of decreased survival in Parkinson's disease. Mortality in Parkinson's disease thus seems to be affected mainly by non-dopaminergic and non-motor features.",

The factor structure of the UPDRS has yet not been analyzed in early PD.A population-based cohort of patients with PD was investigated at the time of diagnosis, one year and three years later. The factor structure of the motor section of the UPDRS was explored using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).We found that the factor structure, the interrelatedness among variables, is different in the first year from diagnosis compared to later stages, but evolves at three years to resemble the factor structure reported for more advanced PD. The only consistent factor throughout the observation period was an axial factor.The factor structure differs in early versus\u00a0more advanced PD, but resembles the factor structure of more advanced PD after three years. This is likely due to a higher proportion of subjects with unilateral motor symptoms in early stages of PD together with a changing distribution of motor symptoms with further disease progression. Initiation of PD medication did not alter the factor structure in early PD. The axial factor was the most consistent factor in early PD and could be the most appropriate factor to monitor progression across the earliest stages of PD.",

We therefore sought to determine whether focal cortical or subcortical grey matter changes may be present from the early disease stage.We recruited 49 untreated, early stage PD patients without dementia and 53 control subjects. Voxel-based morphometry was used to evaluate cortical grey matter changes, and automated volumetry and shape analysis were used to assess volume changes and shape deformation of the subcortical grey matter structures, respectively.Voxel-based morphometry showed neither reductions nor increases in grey matter volume in patients compared to controls. Compared to controls, PD patients had significant reductions in adjusted volumes of putamen, nucleus accumbens, and hippocampus (corrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Vertex-based shape analysis showed regionally contracted area on the posterolateral and ventromedial putamen bilaterally in PD patients (corrected p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No correlations were found between cortical and subcortical grey matter and clinical variables representing disease duration and severity.Our results suggest that untreated, early stage PD without dementia is associated with volume reduction and shape deformation of subcortical grey matter, but not with cortical grey matter reduction. Our findings of structural changes in the posterolateral putamen and ventromedial putamen/nucleus accumbens could provide neuroanatomical basis for the involvement of motor and limbic striatum, further implicating motor and non-motor symptoms in PD, respectively. Early hippocampal involvement might be related to the risk for developing dementia in PD patients.",

Receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses were generated to measure the sensitivity and specificity of various MDRS cutoff scores. To examine the utility of the MDRS as a screening tool, the optimal cutoff point was defined as the lowest value providing \u226580% sensitivity. For use of the MDRS as a diagnostic tool, the optimal cutoff point was defined as the highest value providing \u226580% specificity.ROC analyses showed that the optimal MDRS cutoff score for screening purposes and diagnostic purposes were \u2264140 and \u2264137, respectively. However, an examination of sensitivity/specificity values for the screening cutoff scores suggested that a total score of \u2264139 for screening purposes yielded a better balance between sensitivity (77%) and specificity (65%).In a clinical setting, in which detection of PD-MCI may be important, a total MDRS score of \u2264139 can be used to detect PD-MCI.

As a type of synucleinopathy, pathology spreads widely in cortical and subcortical areas as the disease advances. The exact anatomical and imaging substrates, and electrophysiological or biochemical indicators of cognitive impairment in MSA are not yet clear. Diminished short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) of motor cortex was shown to be an electrophysiological correlate of dementia and mild cognitive impairment associated to Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesize that it can also be electrophysiological correlate of cognitive impairment in MSA.We studied SAI and a neuropsychological test battery in 19 non-demented MSA patients (11 MSA-P and 8 MSA-C), 10 non-demented PD patients and 10 healthy controls. Neuropsychological test scores were grouped in four main cognitive domains (attention, memory, executive and visuo-spatial functions) and were analyzed by factor analysis.All subject groups were matched for age. Moreover, the MSA-P, MSA-C, and PD groups were matched for disease duration. Scores of cognitive domains were similar in MSA and PD cases, while scores in attention, executive and visuo-spatial domains were worse in MSA than controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). SAI was normal in PD but decreased in MSA patients by reaching statistical significance in MSA-C subtype. SAI response was correlated with cognitive performances measured by factor scores of neuropsychological test battery in all study subjects.These results show that cognitive functions are impaired in MSA patients compared to controls as well as a parallel reduction in SAI response.",

Backward stepwise regression analyses were conducted with change in 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-24) score between assessments at baseline and week 12 as the main outcome measure, and sex, age, baseline HAMD-24 score, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale section III (UPDRS-III) score, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and the Clinical Anxiety Scale (CAS) as independent variables.In both the active treatment and placebo groups, higher baseline HAMD-24 score and lower UPDRS-III score were associated with greater reduction in HAMD-24 score. Higher anxiety scores predicted less response in the active treatment group. Higher MMSE scores predicted greater response only in the placebo-treated group.

We detected three novel point mutations located in a poly-glutamic acid repeat within exon 10.

We detected the poly-glutamic acid deletion in exon 10 in two additional patients with sporadic Parkinson's disease.

The cut-off value of 0.22\u00a0cm2 for the SN echogenic area was associated with 100% sensitivity and 78% specificity for the diagnosis of PD. Striatal and putaminal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 binding was lower in PD patients than healthy subjects. The cut-off value of 0.90 for the striatal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 binding was associated with 100% sensitivity and an 89% specificity for the diagnosis of PD, and the cut-off value of 0.76 for putaminal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 binding was associated with an 85% sensitivity and an 89% specificity. The size of the SN echogenic area did not correlate with the degree of striatal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 binding in PD patients. In conclusion, both SN hyperechogenicity and decreased striatal or putaminal 99mTc-TRODAT-1 binding constitute surrogate markers for differentiating PD patients from healthy individuals with a slightly higher diagnostic specificity of 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT.",

Percentage of patients treated surgically was similar in both cases and controls. Intrahospital mortality was 6% both in PD and controls. Infectious diseases were more frequent in PD patients while cardiovascular death was more frequent in controls.Comorbidity in PD is higher than reported in other reports. In our study PD patients had the same length of hospitalization and intrahospital mortality as controls. The presence of a control population allows to discriminate between general complications of the elderly and specific vulnerabilities of PD patients.",

     "abstract": "Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome (PSPS) are atypical parkinsonian syndromes that are both associated with white matter tract degeneration. However, little is known about how patterns of degeneration compare across these two syndromes.Twenty-seven subjects, nine with CBS and eighteen with probable or definite PSPS (9 pathologically confirmed) were prospectively recruited and underwent 3.0\u00a0T diffusion tensor imaging. A whole-brain voxel-based analysis was performed on fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) images to compare both groups to each other and to 50 healthy controls.The two syndromes showed overlapping regions of reduced FA and increased MD in the body of the corpus callosum, middle cingulum bundle, and premotor and prefrontal white matter, with reduced FA also observed in the superior cerebellar peduncles in both syndromes. However, CBS showed a more supratentorial and posterior pattern of degeneration with greater involvement of the splenium of the corpus callosum, premotor, motor and parietal lobes than PSPS. Findings in CBS were also highly asymmetric. Conversely, PSPS showed a more symmetric and infratentorial pattern of degeneration, with greater involvement of the superior cerebellar peduncles and midbrain than CBS.CBS and PSPS are both associated with striking white matter tract degeneration. Despite differences in the supratentorial and infratentorial distribution of degeneration, and in asymmetry, both tend to target a common structural network. Measurements of white matter tract diffusion could therefore be useful disease biomarkers in both of these syndromes.",

     "abstract": "A large body of evidence has shown olfactory deficits in many neurodegenerative diseases. However, the nature of the olfactory impairment remains poorly understood partly because the majority of studies have only explored smell identification capabilities. The purpose of the present study was twofold. First we wanted to test if patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cerebellar ataxia and visual loss, also have olfactory deficits. Secondly, we wanted to test the nature of the olfactory deficits by testing not only the identification level but also olfactory threshold and discrimination. Based on the olfactory dysfunction found in different neurodegenerative diseases and functional neuroimaging data showing cerebellar activation during olfaction, we hypothesized that SCA7 patients would show an olfactory impairment. To test this hypothesis we studied twenty-eight genetically confirmed SCA7 patients and twenty-seven matched controls using the Sniffing Sticks Test and the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT). The results show that SCA7 patients' ability to discriminate and identify odors is significantly impaired, although their odor detection thresholds were at normal levels. These results suggest that SCA7 neurological damage affects olfactory perception but spares the patients' olfactory sensory capabilities.",

In this analysis we explored potential significant associations between APOE e4 allele status and characteristics of clinical presentation in patients with PD.Data came from 424 subjects evaluated using the Uniform Data Set (UDS) assessment collected by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Subjects had a known year of diagnosis of PD and experienced change in motor function prior to any change in cognition. Linear and logistic regression were used to model the association between APOE e4 carrier status and clinical characteristics including measures of cognitive decline and motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Amyloid burden was also evaluated for a subset of patients who died and consented to autopsy.Odds of dementia were higher in APOE e4 carriers (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.15), and, on average, APOE e4 carriers scored two points worse on tests of episodic memory and the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes assessment. There was little evidence to support an association between e4 carrier status and severity of motor features, and, of the four neuropsychiatric symptoms evaluated, only presence of hallucinations was significantly associated with APOE e4 carrier status (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.29). Neuropathology data revealed higher frequencies of neuritic and diffuse amyloid plaques in APOE e4 carriers compared to non-carriers.APOE e4 allele status is associated with dementia and severity of Alzheimer's disease pathologic features in PD.",

     "abstract": "Dyskinesia or abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) are a disabling effect of chronic l-DOPA administration and consequent pulsatile stimulation of dopamine receptors. This abnormal activation causes maladaptive changes including upregulation of FosB expression in dynorphin containing striatal cells. Substance P (SP) is co-localized within dynorphin positive cells and is increased within the substantia nigra by l-DOPA (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) treatment. Accordingly, we determined if treatment with a SP NK1 receptor antagonist reduced the onset of l-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID) in the hemi-parkinsonian rodent model.Adult male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats underwent unilateral 6-OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine-hydrobromide) lesions of the medial forebrain bundle. At day 21, daily administration commenced of either l-DOPA (6\u00a0mg/kg plus 15\u00a0mg/kg of benseraside), l-DOPA with the NK1 antagonist N-acetyl-l-tryptophan (NAT) or equal volume of saline. Animals were tested with the rodent AIM scale assessing axial, contralateral forelimb and orolingual AIMs. Assessment of l-DOPA induced turning was undertaken, and motor function determined using the accelerating rotarod and adjusting step test. Dopaminergic neuronal counts and immunoreactivity for SP and FosB were undertaken.All animals treated with l-DOPA alone developed dyskinesia, whereas combined administration of NAT with l-DOPA significantly reduced onset of AIMs and prevented mild to moderate dyskinesia. In non-dyskinetic NAT treated animals, similar numbers of FosB+ striatal cells were recorded as in saline treated animals. Importantly NAT treatment did not interfere with the anti-parkinsonian effect of l-DOPA.Daily administration of a SP NK1 receptor antagonist may represent a novel treatment regime that reduces the onset of LID whilst conserving motor function.",

This disruption could negatively influence the family dynamic, leading to different perceptions of the STN-DBS outcome by patients and caregivers.We recruited 34 PD patients for this prospective, controlled trial, 28 of whom were examined preoperatively, three months and one year after STN-DBS surgery. The primary outcome was QoL. We compared the patients' ratings and caregivers' proxy QoL ratings. The secondary outcome was social functioning. Additionally, neurological, neuropsychiatric and cognitive domains were analyzed. Changes were analyzed with repeated-measures ANOVA. Regression analysis was used to determine the association between QoL and social functioning.Patients' QoL improved significantly under STN-DBS (p\u00a0=\u00a0.003). At baseline, patients' and caregivers' QoL ratings were similar. However, one year postoperatively, QoL ratings differed significantly (p\u00a0=\u00a0.010), whereby QoL was rated worse by caregivers. Social functioning was positively influenced during the first months postoperatively, but did not improve longitudinally. One year postoperatively, social functioning was significantly associated with QoL ratings (patients: p\u00a0=\u00a0.004, caregivers: p\u00a0=\u00a0.002). Motor scores significantly improved, whereas verbal fluency and apathy worsened.Unequal perception of QoL between patients and caregivers exists under STN-DBS. The fact that social functioning does not improve longitudinally is perhaps due to patient's higher levels of apathy and reduced motivation following surgery. Our findings stress the importance of considering caregiver's input in DBS patients' outcomes and the need for pre-operative preparation.",

To assess the appearance of cardiovascular dysautonomia in PD, we evaluated its relation to olfactory dysfunction in early-stage PD patients.Twenty-three non-demented PD patients within 2 years from the onset of motor symptoms were enrolled. We evaluated olfactory dysfunction by the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J) and analyzed its relationship to the results of other cardiovascular autonomic tests and cardiac 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy.There was a correlation between olfactory scores and increased blood pressure in both the norepinephrine (r\u00a0=\u00a00.75, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, n\u00a0=\u00a021) and dobutamine (r\u00a0=\u00a00.57, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0087, n\u00a0=\u00a020) infusion tests and cardiac MIBG uptake (r\u00a0=\u00a00.42, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049, n\u00a0=\u00a023). The fall in orthostatic blood pressure during the head-up tilt test was not correlated with the olfactory scores, but the Valsalva maneuver revealed that OSIT-J scores correlated with the pressure recovery time from phase III to the return of blood pressure to baseline (r\u00a0=\u00a00.54, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037, n\u00a0=\u00a015) and with the magnitude of blood pressure overshoot during phase IV (r\u00a0=\u00a00.67, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0016, n\u00a0=\u00a020).Our results demonstrate that extensive components of the cardiovascular sympathetic system as well as the olfactory system are correlatively impaired in the early stage of PD, suggesting that degeneration of broad aspects of the cardiovascular sympathetic system occurs concurrently with olfactory system degeneration during the premotor phase of PD.",

Data collected included age at symptom onset, year of onset, family history of Parkinson's disease in first and second degree relatives, predominant first symptom, first anti parkinsonian medication prescribed, frequency of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, therapy related dystonia, therapy related gastrointestinal side effects, hallucination, dementia, depression and apathy.The middle onset was the largest group (51%), followed by the late onset (39%) and the young onset (10%) groups. Young onset patients had a more frequent family history of Parkinson's disease and a longer survival. Symptoms other than tremor were more frequent as the initial symptom of the young onset group, and the frequency of tremor as the first symptom increased with advancing age at onset. Depression was more frequent in the young onset group. The frequency of treatment related dyskinesia or dystonia decreased with advancing age at onset.We have identified specific clinical differences in Parkinson's disease related to the patient's age at onset and added to the existing knowledge of the variability of disease presentation.

In genetic studies of essential tremor (ET), investigators need to screen potential enrollees by mail or telephone to exclude those with other neurological conditions, especially dystonia. In clinical settings, the differentiation of ET and dystonia may also be very challenging. We hypothesized that the spiral axis, described below, is a useful screening tool to distinguish ET cases from dystonia cases.We analyzed the hand-drawn spirals of 135 individuals enrolled in a genetics study at Columbia University Medical Center. Each of the four spirals was assessed for the presence of a single identifiable tremor orientation axis, and a spiral axis score (range\u00a0=\u00a00\u20134) [a single axis on all 4 spirals] was assigned to each enrollee.There were 120\u00a0ET cases and 15 cases with dystonic tremor. Most (101/120, 84.2%) ET cases had an axis score \u22651 vs. only half (8/15, 53.3%) of the dystonia cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Receiver Operator Curve (ROC) analysis revealed that the use of a spiral axis score \u22652 as a cut off would exclude 60.0% of dystonia cases while including 67.5% of ET cases.Handwritten spirals appear to have a single predominant axis in more ET than dystonia cases. The evaluation of this axis has moderate diagnostic validity as a screening tool to distinguish ET cases from those with dystonia. Although this study did not assess the utility of this tool in clinical practice settings, future studies should do so.",

Falls prevention is an urgent priority, but there is no accepted program that specifically addresses the risk profile in PD. Therefore, we aimed to provide consensus-based clinical practice recommendations that systematically address potential fall risk factors in PD. We developed an overview of both generic (age-related) and PD-specific factors. For each factor, we specified: best method of ascertainment; disciplines that should be involved in assessment and treatment; and which interventions could be engaged. Using a web-based tool, we asked 27 clinically active professionals from multiple relevant disciplines to evaluate this overview. The revised version was subsequently reviewed by 12 experts. Risk factors and their associated interventions were included in the final set of recommendations when at least 66% of reviewing experts agreed. These recommendations included 31 risk factors. Nearly all required a multidisciplinary team approach, usually involving a neurologist and PD-nurse specialist. Finally, the expert panel proposed to first identify the specific fall type and to tailor screening and treatment accordingly. A routine evaluation of all risk factors remains reserved for high-risk patients without prior falls, or for patients with seemingly unexplained falls. In conclusion, this project produced a set of consensus-based clinical practice recommendations for the examination and management of falls in PD. These may be used in two ways: for pragmatic use in current clinical practice, pending further evidence; and as the active intervention in clinical trials, aiming to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of large scale implementation.",

Moreover, no study has yet addressed the relationship between posed smiling and abnormalities of voluntary movements of the lower face, global motor impairment and the effects of dopaminergic medication.We investigated the kinematics of posed smiling (mimicking a smile shown in a picture) and those of voluntary movements of the lower face (showing the teeth as fast as possible \u2013 voluntary grinning) in 15 patients with PD (ON and OFF therapy) and in 16 healthy controls. Facial movements were recorded using a 3D optoelectronic system and analyzed using dedicated software.Some kinematic parameters of both posed smiling and voluntary grinning were abnormally lower in PD patients in comparison to healthy subjects. The kinematics of posed smiling correlated with those of voluntary grinning in PD patients but not in healthy controls. Posed smiling and voluntary grinning abnormalities were related to global motor severity but did not significantly improve upon L-dopa administration.These results suggest that posed smiling and voluntary grinning are both abnormal in PD patients and that they are likely mediated by a common pathophysiological mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Deep Brain Stimulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD), but only few studies investigated its long-term efficacy. Furthermore, little is known about the role of PD-subtype on STN-DBS long-term outcome.To report the results of a long-term follow-up (mean 11 years, range 10\u201313) on 26 patients bilaterally implanted in two centres.Patients were assessed preoperatively and 1, 5 and 11 years after the implant by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and a battery of neuropsychological tests. Stimulation parameters, drugs dosages, non-motor symptoms and adverse events were also recorded.At 11 years, stimulation significantly improved the motor symptoms by 35.8%, as compared to the preoperative off-state. Motor complications were well controlled, with a 84.6% improvement of dyskinesias and a 65.8% improvement of motor fluctuations. Despite this, the UPDRS-II-on score worsened by 88.5%, mainly for the worsening of poorly levodopa-responsive symptoms. More than 70% of the patients performed in the normal range in most of the neuropsychological tests, despite the development of dementia in 22.7%. Age at disease onset, axial subscore in off-condition and presence of REM behaviour disorder at baseline were found to be associated with a higher risk of developing disability over time.Our study confirms the long-term safety and efficacy of STN-DBS in PD. Nevertheless, the functionality of patients worsens over time, mainly for the onset and progression of levodopa-resistant and non-motor symptoms. The role of PD-subtype seems to be relevant in the long-term outcome.",

The ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), a pivotal component of the ubiquitin proteasome system which seems to be disturbed in PD, may also be involved in the pathogenesis of this disorder.We investigated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) \u03b1-synuclein and UCH-L1 levels from 22 healthy controls, 52 patients with PD, 34 with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 32 with progressive supranuclear palsy, and 12 with corticobasal degeneration.\u03b1-Synuclein levels were significantly decreased in PD and in MSA compared with controls, and in synucleinopathies compared with tauopathies. UCH-L1 levels were significantly decreased in PD, MSA as well as PSP compared with controls, and in PD compared with APD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Both markers discriminated PD well from controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; area under the curve [AUC]\u00a0=\u00a00.82 and 0.89, respectively). Additionally, CSF \u03b1-synuclein separated patients with synucleinopathies from those with tauopathies (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015; AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.63), whereas CSF UCH-L1 discriminated between PD and APD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003; AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.69). Interestingly, \u03b1-synuclein and UCH-L1 levels were strongly correlated in PD and synucleinopathies, and weakly in tauopathies. No correlation was found in controls.CSF levels of \u03b1-synuclein and UCH-L1 show distinct patterns in parkinsonian syndromes. Their combined determination may be useful in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian disorders and provide key to understanding their pathoetiology and clinical course.

In particular performance in attention/set shifting, verbal memory and language abilities, discriminated both PD-MCI and PDD from PD-CNT. Abilities involved mainly in semantic retrieval mechanisms discriminated PD-CNT from PD-MCI but also PD-MCI from PDD. Finally deficits in executive and visual-spatial abilities were only affected in PDD.Our data point to an independent and different load of each test in defining different PD cognitive statuses.

It is critical to clarify these points given the impact on quality of life.Primary CD patients receiving botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections and age- and gender- matched healthy controls were included. In both groups, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were assessed. In CD, these assessments were repeated following BoNT injections.

     "abstract": "Cardiac sympathetic denervation is associated with orthostatic hypotension (OH) in Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the physiological role of cardiac sympathetic nerves has yet to be elucidated. To clarify the role of the heart in orthostatic stress, we evaluated whether cardiac sympathetic nerves can alter cardiac activity and systolic blood pressure (BP) in association with elevations or depressions of total peripheral resistance during the head-up tilt test.Ninety-five PD patients and 17 normal controls were enrolled. Using impedance cardiography, we measured total peripheral resistance, stroke volume, heart rate, and systolic BP during the head-up tilt test. Cardiac denervation was defined as a heart-to-mediastinum ratio <1.7 for cardiac 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine uptake on delayed images.At 60\u00b0 tilt, total peripheral resistance decreased from the initial value in 49 PD patients. Among these, 36 patients exhibited cardiac denervation with severe reductions in systolic BP but little change in stroke volume; among these patients 22 had OH. The remaining 13 patients without cardiac denervation exhibited significant increases in stroke volume and well-preserved systolic BP with no OH. On the other hand, 46 patients had elevations in total peripheral resistance and reduced stroke volume, but little change in systolic BP, regardless of the presence or absence of cardiac denervation. Only one of these patients experienced OH.Under orthostatic stress, cardiac sympathetic denervation with failure to increase total peripheral resistance leads to large reductions in systolic BP. However, patients without cardiac denervation exhibited a positive inotropic response against vasodilatation, which may prevent OH.",

Analysis of CBF revealed relative reductions in perfusion in the cerebral cortex relative to that in normal control. SPM 8 showed that cognitive functions in PD patients were positively correlated with rCBF in the thalamus and cingulate gyrus.This is the study to demonstrate the cognitive impairments in PD patients using WAIS-III. Visuospatial dysfunction might be caused by decrease in rCBF in the parietal and occipital lobes and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.

Forty-five age- and gender-matched controls were also included. Disease characteristics, cognitive functioning, comorbid psychiatric diseases, dopaminergic and psychiatric medication were evaluated. Diagnosis of DRT-related hypomania and mania was based on DSM-IV-TR criteria with supplementary assessment of two mania self-rating scales. First, patients and controls were compared. Patients with DRT-related hypomania or mania were then compared to the remaining patients. A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify correlates of DRT-related hypomania.Patients scored significantly higher on mania self-rating scales than controls. Twelve patients (11.1%) had DRT-related hypomania and six patients (5.6%) had DRT-related mania. Both groups had significantly higher self-rating mania-scores than patients without these mood states. DRT-related hypomania was significantly related to younger age, younger age at PD onset, dyskinesias, higher levodopa equivalent daily dose, dopamine dysregulation, and amantadine treatment. In contrast, DRT-related mania was significantly associated with hallucinations and delusions, history of levodopa-induced psychosis, quetiapine treatment, higher depression and daily levodopa dose, and cognitive deficits. Regression analysis revealed dopamine dysregulation, dyskinesias, amantadine treatment, and younger age at PD onset as significant correlates of DRT-related hypomania.DRT-related hypomania and mania are relevant comorbidities in PD. DRT-related hypomania may exist as a distinct psychiatric symptom complex in young patients with early disease onset. Different patient profiles likely underlie DRT-related hypomania and mania.",

     "abstract": "Parkinsonian features have been used as a minor diagnostic criterion for fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). However, prior studies have examined parkinsonism (defined as having bradykinesia with at least rest tremor or postural instability) mostly in premutation carriers without a diagnosis of FXTAS. The current study was intended to elaborate this important aspect of the FXTAS spectrum, and to quantify the relationships between parkinsonism, FXTAS clinical staging and genetic/molecular measures.Thirty eight (38) FXTAS patients and 10 age-matched normal controls underwent a detailed neurological examination that included all but one item (i.e. rigidity) of the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS).The FXTAS patient group displayed substantially higher prevalence of parkinsonian features including body bradykinesia (57%) and rest tremor (26%), compared to the control group. Furthermore, parkinsonism was identified in 29% of FXTAS patients. Across all patients, body bradykinesia scores significantly correlated with FXTAS clinical stage, FMR1 mRNA level, and ataxic gait of cerebellar origin, while postural instability was associated with intention tremor.Parkinsonian features in FXTAS appear to be characterized as bradykinesia concurrent with cerebellar gait ataxia, postural instability accompanied by intention tremor, and frequent rest tremor, representing distinctive patterns that highlight the need for further clinical studies including genetic testing for the FMR1 premutation. The association between FMR1 mRNA level and bradykinesia implicates pathophysiological mechanisms which may link FMR1 mRNA toxicity, dopamine deficiency and parkinsonism in FXTAS.",

Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and REM sleep without atonia (RWA) are recognized as early harbingers of neurodegeneration and may precede motor symptoms by years. However, their impact on motor progression remains elusive.We retrospectively analyzed polysomnographic and clinical data of 59 PD patients, grouping them into patients with RBD (n\u00a0=\u00a015), RWA (n\u00a0=\u00a022) and those with normal muscle atonia (n\u00a0=\u00a022). We compared the three groups with regard to motor progression, defined as changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III values per year, and selected PD specific characteristics.Motor disability at first visit and time interval between first and last visits were similar between groups. We observed a significantly faster motor progression in PD patients with RBD and RWA than in those with preserved REM sleep atonia.Our findings suggest that impaired muscle atonia during REM sleep might represent a marker of faster motor progression in PD.",

Recently 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) myocardial scintigraphy has become widely used for this purpose, since this test shows high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of PD, based on evidence that cardiac sympathetic nerve fibers are affected early and commonly in PD. We reviewed the literature to determine the role of MIBG myocardial scintigraphy for diagnosing pre-motor PD.We performed a systematic review of the literature to identify the use of MIBG myocardial scintigraphy in relation to the constellation of pre-motor symptoms in PD.Mild memory disorder, autonomic failure (constipation and postural hypotension), depression/anxiety, visual hallucination/psychosis (in the elderly), sleep disorder (REM sleep behavior disorder), and impaired olfaction are reported to appear as sole initial symptoms of PD. All clinical features except for impaired olfaction are accompanied by low MIBG uptake, suggestive of very early PD in situ.Identifying persons with mild memory disorder, constipation/postural hypotension, depression/anxiety, visual hallucination/psychosis (in the elderly), and REM sleep behavior disorder associated with low MIBG uptake may provide a unique opportunity to detect very early PD in situ within a pre-clinical window. Future prospective studies to investigate further the findings of these early cases are warranted.",

Differences in HRQL outcomes between COEs could uncover modifiable aspects of care delivery.This cross-sectional study examined the relative contribution of demographic, social, clinical and treatment features potentially related to HRQL, as measured by the PDQ-39, in 4601 consecutive subjects from 18 COEs. Stepwise linear regression was utilized to identify correlates of HRQL.The variability in the PDQ-39 summary index score correlated with H&Y stage (R2\u00a0=\u00a022%), Timed up and Go (TUG) (17%), disease duration (11%), comorbidities (8%), cognitive status (8%), antidepressant use (6%) and center at which a patient received care (5%). Stepwise regression reordered the importance of the variables, with the H&Y first and TUG and the center becoming equal and the second most important variables determining the PDQ-39 total score. All independent variables together accounted for 44% of the variability in HRQL.We confirmed many but not all HRQL associations found in smaller studies. A novel observation was that the site of care was an important contributor to HRQL, suggesting that comparison of outcomes and processes among centers may identify best practices.",

     "abstract": "In view of freezing of gait's circumstances of occurrence in Parkinson's disease, attentional resources appear to be involved in step initiation failure. Anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) are essential because they allow unloading of the stepping leg and so create the conditions required for progression.Our main objective was to establish whether or not a change in attentional load during step initiation modulates APAs differently in patients with vs. without freezing of gait.Three groups of 15 subjects were recruited: elderly people and parkinsonian patients with or without freezing of gait. Attention was modulated before step execution by means of an auditory oddball discrimination task with event-related potential recording. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of inappropriate APAs following the attentional task, i.e. APAs not followed by a step after an intercurrent auditory stimulus.In parkinsonian patients with freezing of gait, inappropriate APAs were recorded in 63% of the trials and were observed more frequently than in patients without freezing of gait (51%) and elderly controls (48%). Furthermore, inappropriate APAs in freezers were longer and more ample than in parkinsonian non-freezers and controls. Lastly, postural preparation was impaired in the parkinsonian patients.Our results indicate that allocation of attentional resources during step preparation influences the release of APAs differently in freezers and non-freezers. Modulating attentional load is partly responsible for triggering an inappropriate motor program. This difficulty in focusing attention or resisting interference may contribute (at least in part) to the gait initiation failure observed in parkinsonian freezers.",

     "abstract": "Hallucinations are a frequent and severe complication in Parkinson's disease (PD). Minor hallucinations are generally not disturbing, but likely progress to well-structured hallucinations with loss of insight and a great impact on quality of life. Knowledge on the neural bases of minor hallucinations may help to describe those systems associated with the early development of psychotic phenomena in PD.In this study, we aimed to identify the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with minor hallucinations in PD by using voxel-based morphometry (VBM).We prospectively collected a sample of 46 non-demented PD patients, with (N\u00a0=\u00a017) and without (n\u00a0=\u00a029) minor hallucinations (passage and/or presence hallucinations), and 15 healthy controls. Groups were matched for age, education and global cognitive function. Presence and type of minor psychotic phenomena was assessed by the new MDS-UPDRS. Three dimensional T1-weighted MRI images were acquired with a 1.5\u00a0T magnet, and analyzed using optimized VBM.Compared to controls, PD with minor hallucinations (PD-mH) showed reduced gray matter volume bilaterally in different areas of the dorsal visual stream, and in functionally related midbrain and cerebellar structures. Additionally, bilateral gray matter volume increases were observed in the PD-mH group in limbic and paralimbic regions.Our data support a major role of the dorsal visual stream in the genesis of minor hallucinations in PD, reinforcing the importance of posterior cortical regions for the development of cognitive and psychiatric complications in PD.",

     "abstract": "Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the auditory blink reflex is a measure of sensorimotor gating, which reflects an organism's ability to filter out irrelevant sensory information. PPI has never been studied in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), although sensorimotor deficits are frequently associated with synucleinopathies. We investigated whether alterations in PPI were more pronounced in MSA compared with Parkinson's disease (PD), idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) and healthy controls.10 patients with MSA, 12 patients with iRBD, 40 patients with PD, and 20 healthy controls completed the study. A passive acoustic prepulse inhibition paradigm was applied with prepulses 5\u00a0dB and 15\u00a0dB above background noise at 30-, 60-, 120- and 300-ms intervals.Non-parametric analyses showed that MSA patients had significantly lower prepulse inhibition, as measured with max-amplitude, than PD patients and iRBD patients on the 60\u00a0ms\u201385\u00a0dB and 120\u00a0ms\u201385\u00a0dB inter-stimulus intervals. The same relation was found when using area under the curve. No differences were found between groups for the 30\u00a0ms\u201385\u00a0dB and 300\u00a0ms\u201385\u00a0dB. Furthermore, blink reflex characteristics such as habituation did not differ between patients and controls.The present study showed that sensorimotor gating, as measured with PPI, is markedly reduced in MSA. This may be due to the pronounced severity of striatal and brainstem dysfunction, as well as the degeneration of other structures related to the PPI modulating pathways in MSA. PPI may be a non-invasive neurophysiological measure that can aid in the differential diagnosis between PD and MSA.",

We conducted autonomic function tests to quantify autonomic dysfunction in PD patients and to elucidate its possible relationship with disease progression.We performed autonomic function tests including Valsalva ratio, heart rate response to deep breathing, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test, and head-up tilt test in 66 patients with PD. We compared clinical characteristics and results of autonomic function tests between stages, and correlated the proportion of abnormal patients in each test with their H&Y stage. In addition, logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the contribution of increasing H&Y stage to impairments of each domain of the autonomic nervous system.We found that PD patients with higher disease stage tended to have impairments in cardiovagal and sudomotor domains of the autonomic nervous system. Cardiovagal function was the domain most influenced by disease progression. Our findings also demonstrated that the pattern of sudomotor impairment in PD was similar to that in patients with peripheral autonomic neuropathy.Our study demonstrates that autonomic dysfunction is not only common in early stage PD but it increases in severity with increasing disease stage. Given that the patterns of sudomotor impairments in PD are similar to those in peripheral neuropathy, our data support a previous hypothesis that pathophysiology of PD involves both the central and peripheral nervous systems.",

     "abstract": "Recent studies highlight the role of DNA methylation in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, there is a paucity of studies exploring the role of blood-based DNA methylation in PD. We aimed to explore identifiable epigenetic biomarkers for PD by analyzing the methylation status of \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) in leukocytes.Bisulfite Specific PCR-based Sequencing method was used for semi-quantitative detection of methylation status of CpG islands in SNCA and LRRK2 promoter regions. Bisulfite Specific Cloning-based Sequencing method was used for further quantitative examination of CpG-2 methylation of SNCA. mRNA level was also detected in leukocytes.Semi-quantitative detection showed that the methylation status of SNCA CpG-2 differed between PD patients and normal controls, while there was no difference in CpG-1 of SNCA or in LRRK2 promoter. Further quantitative analysis by clonal assay showed that the CpG-2 of SNCA was hypomethylated in PD patients compared with the normal control (5.90% versus 7.69%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.034). Moreover, among the 14 CpG sites of CpG-2, the 2nd, 4th and 9th CpG sites were significantly hypomethylated in PD patients. In subgroups of PD, the methylation level decreased in the early-onset PD patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). RT-PCR examination showed that SNCA mRNA was increased in PD patients compared with normal control (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003).Our results indicated that the methylation level of SNCA CpG-2, especially that of the 2nd, 4th and 9th CpG sites in leukocytes might have great potential to be a useful and informative biomarker in PD diagnosis and treatment.",

The pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) was the first NBIA form to be genetically identified almost 15 years ago. Nowadays, eight types can be genetically distinguished. More recently, a novel NBIA was delineated and termed Static Encephalopathy of childhood with Neurodegeneration in Adulthood (SENDA), characterized by early intellectual disability followed by delayed progressive motor and cognitive deterioration with an onset in the second to third decade. Very recently, mutations in the WD repeat-containing protein 45 (WDR45) gene located on Xp11.23 were shown to be the causal factor. The protein encoded by WDR45 propels protein interaction important for autophagy. This form was therefore retermed Beta-propeller Protein Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN). Here, the first three Dutch patients with genetically proven BPAN are comprehensively described with respect to course and neurological as well as neuropsychiatric phenotypes. All three showed a characteristic delayed progression of neurological symptoms with parkinsonism and prominent dystonia. Treatment with levodopa/carbidopa had limited effects only. Neuropsychiatric symptoms within the autistic and affective spectrum were present in the early phase of the disease. The specific course and prognosis should implicate restrained psychopharmacological interventions.The clinical picture and imaging hallmarks are often highly suggestive and should lead to suspect this specific disorder. However, the identification of a WDR45 mutation is needed for a definite diagnosis of BPAN.",

The objective was to assess the efficacy, safety, and impact on quality of life of IPX066 in the treatment of levodopa-naive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients.This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 30-week study of 381 levodopa-na\u00efve patients assigned to placebo or IPX066 containing 145, 245 or 390\u00a0mg of levodopa administered three times daily (TID). The primary efficacy measure was change from Baseline in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) activities of daily living (Part II)\u00a0+\u00a0motor scores (Part III), at 30 weeks. Secondary outcome measures included UPDRS total and subscores, patient and clinician global impressions (PGI-I, CGI-I), and the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39).All IPX066 dosages were superior to placebo throughout the study and at 30 weeks (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The mean improvement in UPDRS Parts II\u00a0+\u00a0III at 30 weeks compared to baseline was 11.7, 12.9, and 14.9 points for the three dosages and 0.6 points for placebo (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, all dosages). PDQ-39 total scores improved with IPX066 (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.034, all dosages). The most commonly reported adverse events with IPX066 included nausea, dizziness, and headache. No unexpected drug-related serious adverse events were reported.IPX066 provided significant clinical benefits at the three dosages tested compared to placebo and was well tolerated in levodopa-naive PD patients. Of the dosages tested, IPX066 145\u00a0mg TID appeared to provide the best overall balance between efficacy and safety.",

In contrast, ten of the 20 PSP patients exhibited abnormal iso intensities of the decussation of the SCP, while the other 10 showed high intensity signals. Among the PSP patients, there were no differences in clinical features between those with and those without visualization of the decussation of the SCP. Iso intensity signals had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 100% for differentiating PSP from PD, MSA, and controls.This MRI procedure (RESOLVE) shows a potential for detecting the involvement of the decussation of the SCP in PSP, and can be used for discriminating PSP from PD and MSA-P.",

The test battery included n-Back Task, Wechsler Memory Scale, Trail Making Test version A and B, and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test.As compared with healthy control subjects of similar age, sex and socio-economic status, patients with cranial-cervical dystonia showed deficit on working memory functions revealed by n-Back task, impairment of mental control and visual reproduction subtests of Wechsler memory scale, deficit on information processing speed and set-shifting capacity revealed by Trail Making Test A and B.Patients with cranial-cervical dystonia may have impairment in specific cognitive domains relative to working memory, processing speed, visual motor ability and short term memory. Probably, these deficits are not dependent on the clinical expression of dystonia but might rather reflect the cortical and subcortical changes highlighted by functional and VBM imaging studies in patients with different forms of dystonia.",

It has been suggested that a postoperative decline in visual emotion recognition is responsible for those adverse events, although there is also evidence that emotional processing deficits can be present before surgery.The aim of the present study is to compare the ability to recognize emotions before and one year after surgery in APD. Methods: Consecutively operated APD patients were tested pre-operatively and one year after STN-DBS by the Comprehensive Affect Testing System (CATS), which evaluates visual recognition of 7 basic emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust and neutral) on facial expressions and 4 emotions on prosody (happiness, sadness, anger and fear).In a sample of 30 patients 6 had depression or apathy at baseline that significantly increased to 14 post-surgery. There were no significant changes in the tests of identity discrimination, discrimination of emotional faces, naming of emotional faces, recognition of emotional prosody, and naming of emotional prosody after STN-DBS. The results of emotion tests could not predict the development of the neuropsychiatric symptoms.This study does not support the hypothesis of an acquired change in emotion recognition, either in faces or in prosody, after STN-DBS in APD patients. Neuropsychiatric symptoms appearing after STN-DBS should not be attributed to new deficits in emotional recognition.",

     "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), the response to l-dopa is highly variable and unpredictable. The major pathway for dopamine synthesis from l-dopa is decarboxylation by aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD, encoded by the DDC gene).To determine the motor response to l-dopa in PD patients as a function of the DDC gene promoter polymorphisms (rs921451\u00a0T\u00a0>\u00a0C polymorphism (DDCT/C) and rs3837091 AGAG del (DDCAGAG/\u2212)).Thirty-three Caucasian PD patients underwent an acute l-dopa challenge together with the peripheral AAAD inhibitor benserazide and were genotyped for rs921451 and rs3837091. The primary efficacy criterion was the motor response to l-dopa, as estimated by the area under the curve for the change in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS) score relative to baseline (AUC\u0394UPDRS) in the 4\u00a0h following l-dopa administration. Secondary endpoints were pharmacokinetic parameters for plasma levels of l-dopa and dopamine. Investigators and patients were blinded to genotypes data throughout the study.When adjusted for the l-dopa dose, the AUC\u0394UPDRS was significantly lower in DDCCC/CT patients (n\u00a0=\u00a014) than in DDCTT patients (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and significantly lower in DDC\u2212/\u2212 or AGAG/\u2212 patients (n\u00a0=\u00a08) than in DDCAGAG/AGAG patients (n\u00a0=\u00a025). There were no significant intergroup differences in plasma pharmacokinetic parameters for l-dopa and dopamine.The rs921451 and rs3837091 polymorphisms of the DDC gene promoter influence the motor response to l-dopa but do not significantly change peripheral pharmacokinetic parameters for l-dopa and dopamine.

We investigated the pattern of gray matter (GM) density according to olfactory performance using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and analyzed the correlation between GM density and olfactory performance.No significant differences in demographic characteristics were observed among the groups. A neuropsychological test showed that cognitive deficits in verbal memory function were more severe in the PD-L group than in the PD-H group. However, a VBM analysis revealed that patients in the PD-H group possessed significantly decreased GM density in the bilateral temporal areas, orbitofrontal areas, mesiofrontal areas extending into the cingulate gyrus, and prefrontal areas, compared with patients in the PD-L group. No areas exhibiting a significant difference in GM density were observed between the PD-H and PD-M groups. Olfactory performance in patients with PD was negatively correlated with both the brain GM volume and intracerebral volume; in particular, GM density in the caudate nucleus and putamen exhibited a negative correlation with olfactory performance.Our data show that a high olfactory performance may compensate GM volume loss in order to minimize the exhibition of cognitive impairment and thus may act as a cognitive reserve in non-demented patients with PD.",

     "abstract": "Clinical diagnostic criteria indicate presence of autonomic features as the primary hallmark of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA). However involvement of the autonomic system is also a recognized feature of Parkinson's Disease (PD), yielding a broad clinical overlap between the two diseases. Laboratory assessments may help in the differential diagnosis between PD and MSA. Ambulatory Monitoring of Blood Pressure (AMBP) is a suitable tool to study the circadian rhythm of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR). Different studies reported a reduction of physiological BP nocturnal dipping in PD and MSA patients, but failed to identify a distinctive pattern discriminating the two diseases. On the other hand, HR nocturnal behavior has not been exhaustively analyzed. In the present study we compared the profiles of HR circadian rhythm in 61 PD and 19\u00a0MSA patients who underwent 24\u00a0h AMBP.We found higher nocturnal HR (nHR) (71.5\u00a0beats/min\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4) in MSA compared with PD (63.8 beats/min\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6) as well as significantly lower nocturnal decline of HR (ndHR) in MSA (7.3%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2) vs. PD (14%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5). At a Receiver Operating Curve analysis nHR and ndHR significantly discriminated MSA from PD. nHR showed a sensitivity of 84.2% and a specificity of 62.3% (AUC 0.76; 95% IC 0.65\u20130.85); ndHR showed a sensitivity of 68% of and a specificity of 77% (AUC 0.72; 95% IC 0.61\u20130.82).According to our findings, nHR is increased and ndHR is reduced in MSA compared to PD. Moreover, these two indices discriminate between the two diseases with acceptable accuracy.",

Assessment included selected cross-sectional areas, regional apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and gradient echo (GRE) intensity ratios of the lateral ventricles, caudate, putamen, middle cerebellar peduncle, pons and midbrain.On follow-up imaging, there was a larger ADC increase in the putamen in PSP over time compared to controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In MSA there was greater volume loss in the pons over time compared to controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

To our knowledge, it has not been reported previously nor has it been the subject of study. Here we: 1) report the phenomenon, 2) provide several visual illustrations, 3) estimate its prevalence, and 4) analyze its clinical correlates. Head tremor was assessed qualitatively, and scores were assigned pre-, during, and post-sustained phonation using the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale. Seventy (68.6%) of 102 essential tremor (ET) patients exhibited a qualitative increase in head tremor amplitude during and/or immediately after sustained phonation; in 5 (4.9%), head tremor would not have been detected without the voice activation maneuver (i.e., it was not visible at any other point in the videotape aside from the period during/immediately following sustained phonation). Women were more likely than men to exhibit this phenomenon (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), whereas age, age at onset, duration of tremor, and total tremor score did not predict responsiveness of head tremor to sustained phonation. Sustained voice activation is a useful examination maneuver that may elicit or amplify head tremor in ET. Head tremor is not reported to occur in patients with enhanced physiological tremor. Thus, this maneuver, by triggering head tremor, may be a useful diagnostic supplement, particularly in research/clinical settings where arm tremor is mild and the diagnosis (mild ET vs. enhanced physiological tremor) would otherwise be ambiguous.",

     "abstract": "Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) is a very heterogeneous disease, both genetically and clinically. To date, approximately 52 loci and 31 genes have been reported to be involved in the causality of HSP. The pattern of inheritance of the disease can be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive. Autosomal recessive HSP with thin corpus callosum (ARHSP-TCC) is one form of this disease, and a recessive gene, SPG11, is responsible for 41\u201377% of all ARHSP-TCC cases. SPG11 encodes the protein SPATACSIN, which is most prominently expressed in the cerebellum. However, little is known about its function. Despite diverse clinical presentations, diffuse hypometabolism in the cerebellum has not been reported previously. We have identified an HSP-TCC patient that presented with prominent intellectual disability rather than spasticity. 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18FDG-PET/CT) examination showed diffuse hypometabolism in both cerebella. Mutation screening of the SPG11 gene using Sanger sequencing identified the novel compound heterozygous mutation c.[5121_5122insAG]+[6859C>T] (p.[I1708RfsX2]+[Q2287X]) in the patient. The mother bears the c.5121_5122insAG mutation, which results in a frameshift and is predicted to truncate the 735 amino acids from the C-terminus, and the father carries the c.6859C>T mutation, which terminates the 157 amino acids from the C-terminus. Therefore, these mutations may result in the loss of function of wild-type SPATACSIN. Our results suggest that SPATACSIN may be involved in cerebella metabolism, and the novel mutations provide more data for the mutational spectrum of this gene, which will aid in the development of quick and accurate genetic diagnostic tools for this disease.",

Thirty four papers were found on education and cognition in PD but there were no studies of the other proxies of reserve. A random effects meta-analysis was used to assess the associations between education and cross-sectional cognitive assessments, longitudinal global cognitive decline and a long term dementia diagnosis.There was a significant association between higher education and cross-sectional performance of MMSE, global cognition, mild cognitive impairment, attention, executive function, visuospatial function and memory. There was a small but significant association between higher education and a reduced rate of cognitive decline. There was no association with a final dementia diagnosis. There was not enough information to perform an analysis on the rate and timing of transition to dementia.Higher levels of education are associated with significantly better cognitive performance and a small but significant slowing in cognitive decline but are not associated with a reduction in long-term dementia in PD. More detailed, standardized, longitudinal studies are required to study conclusively the effects cognitive reserve in PD.",

Fifty four pianists with musician's dystonia who had received care in a Movement Disorders Clinic completed a self report questionnaire regarding type and effectiveness of treatment received over the last 4 years. Pianists' fine motor control was assessed objectively by measuring the temporal regularity of their scale playing.Nearly all patients (98.0%) reported deficits in motor tasks other than musical playing. Half of the patients were taking medications (Botulinum toxin (53%), Trihexyphenidyl (51%)).

These subjects had previously undergone (+)-[11C] dihydrotetrabenazine vesicular monoamine transporter 2 and [11C] methyl-4-piperidinyl propionate acetylcholinesterase PET imaging. Acetylcholinesterase PET imaging assesses cholinergic terminal integrity with cortical uptake largely reflecting basal forebrain and thalamic uptake principally reflecting pedunculopontine nucleus integrity.Eight of thirty subjects reported a history of risky driving (been pulled over, had a traffic citation, or been in an accident since PD onset) while 22 had no such history (safe drivers). There was no difference in striatal dihydrotetrabenazine vesicular monoamine transporter uptake between risky and safe drivers. There was significantly less thalamic acetylcholinesterase activity in the risky drivers compared to safe drivers (0.0513\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006 vs. 0.0570\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006, p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) but no difference in neocortical acetylcholinesterase activity. Using multivariable logistic regression, decreased thalamic acetylcholinesterase activity remained an independent predictor of risky driving in PD even after controlling for age and disease duration.Risky driving is related to pedunculopontine nucleus-thalamic but not neocortical cholinergic denervation or nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation in PD. This suggests that degeneration of the pedunculopontine nucleus, a brainstem center responsible for postural and gait control, plays a role in the ability of PD patients to drive.",

PD patients who complained of drooling, orthostatic dizziness, and diplopia had greater denervation of the caudata than did the PD patients who did not report the same symptoms. The differences observed were not associated with differences in age, sex, UPDRS-III score, and the presence/absence of tremor.The declaration of non-motor symptoms is influenced by subjective factors that are widely suggestible.

Levodopa daily dose, vitamin B12 (VB12) and homocysteine (hcy) levels differed significantly in patients with PN compared to patients without PN.Our findings support the relationship between levodopa and PN and confirm that an imbalance in VB12/hcy may be a key pathogenic factor. We suggest two different, possibly overlapping mechanisms of PN in patients on CDLII: axonal degeneration due to vitamin deficiency and inflammatory damage. Whether inflammatory damage is triggered by vitamin deficiency and/or by modifications in the intestinal micro-environment should be further explored. Proper vitamin supplementation may prevent peripheral damage in most cases.",

Thirty-six percent of participants were diagnosed with dementia using the MDS algorithm, but with the Dementia Rating Scale instead of the MMSE. The original MDS procedure misclassified 11 patients (12.8%) as false negatives and 3 (3.5%) as false positives, leading to 65% sensitivity and 95% specificity. The main reason for misdiagnoses was insensitivity of the MMSE total score. Three attempts were made to reach a better screening performance, which warrants high sensitivity more than high specificity: 1. exclusion of the MMSE total score as a diagnostic requirement; 2. determination of a better cut off through Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis; 3. replacement of the MMSE with the equally undemanding, but more PD-specific, Mini Mental Parkinson. The first two strategies generally yielded high sensitivity, but poor specificity. The best outcome was achieved using a Mini Mental Parkinson total score <27 as cognitive criterion: sensitivity was 87% and negative predictive value was 90%; however, specificity was only 67%. Our findings seem to suggest that MDS practical guidelines are specific, but might benefit from the use of more PD-oriented tools than the MMSE in terms of sensitivity.",

Motion sensors can accurately rate tremor severity during a set of predefined tasks in a laboratory.We evaluated the ability of motion sensors to quantify tremor during unconstrained activities at home. 20 ET subjects wore a wireless sensor continuously for up to 10\u00a0h daily on two days and completed hourly standardized tremor assessments involving pre-defined tasks. Mathematical models were used to predict tremor rating scores from the sensor data.At home tremor scores from hourly standardized assessments correlated with at home tremor scores estimated during unconstrained activities immediately following the standardized assessments. The hourly standardized assessments did not significantly fluctuate throughout the day, while fluctuations in the continuous assessments tended to follow changes in voluntary activity level. Both types of tremor ratings (standardized and continuous) showed high day-to-day test-retest reliability with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.67 to 0.90 for continuous ratings and 0.77 to 0.95 for standardized ratings.Results demonstrate the feasibility of continuous monitoring of tremor severity at home, which should provide clinicians with a measure of the temporal pattern of tremor in the context of daily life and serve as a useful tool for the evaluation of novel anti-tremor medications in clinical trials.",

Provided strict inclusion criteria are respected, older age and longer disease duration are associated with slightly worse effects mainly on L-dopa-resistant symptoms.",

     "abstract": "There have been no previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies comparing Parkinson's disease (PD) with postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) parkinsonism.Utilizing DTI with 2-region tractography, we conducted a case control study to determine if different brain regions representing the neural network of the motor system are differentially affected in PIGD compared to PD and controls.On a 3\u00a0T MR machine, using manual ROI (regions of interest) we determined the fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on DTI in anatomical brain regions representing the extrapyramidal, pyramidal, and transcallosal tracts, aided by 2-region tractography. FA and ADC were correlated with the Tinetti score (measure of gait and balance).Sixty-five subjects (21 PD, 25 PIGD, 19 controls) were included in the analysis. We demonstrated greater ADC abnormalities in the extrapyramidal, pyramidal and transcallosal motor systems in PIGD compared to controls. Multivariate analysis taking into consideration various clinical variables showed that the FA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and ADC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) values in the corpus callosum body differentiated PIGD from PD. PIGD with low Tinetti score had a lower FA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and a higher ADC value (corpus callosum body) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) compared to those with a high score.We demonstrated for the first time that DTI abnormalities along the transcallosal motor tract in the body of the corpus callosum, but not the substantia nigra, differentiated PIGD from PD, and the degree of corpus callosum body abnormality correlated with the Tinetti score (a measure of risk of falls).",

     "abstract": "We applied the idea of synergies and the framework of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis to explore the effects of dopamine replacement therapy on finger interaction and coordination in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD).Eight patients performed single-finger and multi-finger force production tasks with both the dominant and non-dominant hand before (off-drug) and after (on-drug) taking their dopaminergic medications. Synergy indices were defined as co-varied adjustments of commands to fingers that stabilized the total force produced by the hand.PD patients showed significantly lower maximal finger forces off-drug compared to the on-drug condition, while indices of finger individuation (enslaving) were unchanged. The synergy indices were weaker during steady-state force production off-drug compared to on-drug. Anticipatory adjustments of synergies prior to the quick force pulse initiation were delayed and reduced off-drug as compared to the on-drug condition. These drug effects were observed in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic hands of the patients whose symptoms were limited to one side of the body.The study demonstrates dopaminergic modulation of motor coordination in PD and supports that the analysis of different components of multi-finger synergies offers a set of indices sensitive to the effects of dopamine replacement therapy in early-stage PD. The results suggest an important role of the basal ganglia in synergy formation and in feed-forward synergy adjustments. Future studies using these methods may yield more objective, quantitative biomarker(s) of motor coordination impairments in PD, and better understanding of subcortical involvement in the neural control of natural actions.",

The patient cohort harbors a total of 10 common and 48 rare mutations in the coding region of ATP7B including 21 novel changes. The common mutations represent 74% of characterized coding mutant alleles with p.C271X (63/260) and p.G1101R (7/31) being the most prevalent in eastern and western Indian patients, respectively. The mutation spectrum between east and west is mostly different with only three mutations (p.G1061E, p.N1270S and p.A1049A-fs) being shared between both the groups. Eight novel and 10 reported variants have been detected in the promoter and non-coding regions (5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs) of ATP7B. Promoter reporter assay demonstrated that 3 novel variants and 5 reported polymorphisms alter the gene expression to a considerable extent; hence might play important role in ATP7B gene regulation. We devised the neurological involvement score to capture the spectrum of neurological involvement in WD patients. By utilizing the age at onset, neurological involvement score and ATP7B mutation background, we generated a genotype\u2013phenotype matrix that could be effectively used to depict the phenotypic spectra of WD affected individuals and serve as a platform to identify prospective \u201coutliers\u201d to be investigated for their remarkable phenotypic divergence.",

We used data from a large, publicly-available genome-wide association study (GWAS) in the discovery stage (n\u00a0=\u00a02000 cases and 1986 controls) and data from three independent studies for the replication stage (total n\u00a0=\u00a02113 cases and 2095 controls).

The association between each SNP and PD was modeled using logistic regression with an additive allele dosage effect and adjusted for sex, age, and axes of geographical variation.Although the discovery stage yielded promising findings for SNPs in several novel genes, including DAB1, none of the results were validated in the replication stage. Furthermore, in meta-analyses across all datasets no genes within PARK10 reached significance after accounting for multiple testing.Our results suggest that common variation in the PARK10 region is not associated with PD risk. However, additional studies are needed to assess the role of PARK10 in modifying age at onset and to determine whether rare variants in this region might affect PD susceptibility.",

We aimed to delineate effects of age and gender on the phenotype in an incident cohort of PD patients and healthy controls from the Oxford Parkinson Disease Centre (OPDC).Clinical features, including demographic and medical characteristics and non-motor and motor symptoms, were analyzed in a group of PD patients within 3 years of diagnosis and a group of healthy controls from the OPDC cohort. Disease features were stratified according to age and compared between genders, controlling for effects of common covariates.490 PD patients and 176 healthy controls were analyzed. Stratification by age showed increased disease severity with age on motor scales. Some non-motor features showed similar trend, including cognition and autonomic features. Comparison across genders highlighted a pattern of increased severity and greater symptom symmetricality in the face, neck and arms in men with women having more postural problems. Amongst the non-motor symptoms, men had more cognitive impairment, greater rate of REM behavior disorder (RBD), more orthostatic hypotension and sexual dysfunction.Age in PD is a strong factor contributing to disease severity even after controlling for the effect of disease duration.

Perhaps the most important facet of idiopathic RBD is that it is a powerful prodromal marker of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. Several prospective studies have now established that patients with idiopathic RBD have up to an 80% risk of developing a defined neurodegenerative synucleinopathy. This has profound implications for understanding and treating early disease. First, the extremely high risk and long latency/time to intervene make RBD patients the ideal candidates for neuroprotective therapy against synucleinopathy. Second, RBD patients can be used as a \u2018test lab\u2019 to assess other potential prodromal predictors of PD, which could be applied to the general population in future large-scale screening programs. Third, assessing epidemiology of RBD allows us to study the epidemiology of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies 10\u201315 years earlier, reducing bias and opening new hypotheses as to the mechanism of action of selected risk factors. Finally, by prospectively observing RBD patients as they transition to full neurodegenerative synucleinopathy, one has an unprecedented window in which to directly observe evolution of PD from its prodromal stages. The evidence for RBD as a marker of prodromal PD and all these implications will be discussed.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this article is to review movement disorders in children. They are common but have etiology and phenomenology different than in adults. Tics are the most common phenomena although in most instances they are mild and have a favorable long-term prognosis. Dystonia is the second most common phenomena but when present it is usually genetic or idiopathic and causes meaningful disability. Sydenham's chorea is the most common cause of chorea in children worldwide. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a much rarer cause of chorea but it is always to be ruled out given the lack of a specific diagnostic marker for Sydenham's chorea. Tremor, usually caused by drugs or essential tremor, is regarded as rather uncommon in children. Arguably, most pediatric patients with tremor do not seek medical attention because of the lack of disability. Stereotypies are relatively uncommon but their recognition is clinically relevant since they are usually associated with severe conditions such as autism and Rett syndrome. Parkinsonism is quite rare in children and either results from encephalitis or is a side effect of medications. Wilson's disease must be ruled out in all children with movement disorders.",

     "abstract": "Aside from motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease is associated with a number of non-motor symptoms arising many years before motor signs. The most prevalent and predictive premotor symptoms include olfactory dysfunction, REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) and constipation. Several studies in toxin- or gene-based models have specifically investigated these non-motor signs in a premotor context. Altered olfactory discrimination has been reproduced both in toxin- and in gene-based models, and genetic models may also reproduce the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Sleep alterations have also been demonstrated, mostly in toxin-based models, and RBD-like features can be demonstrated in non-human primates. Gastrointestinal dysfunction and associated enteric pathology are reproduced both in toxin and genetic models displaying reduced colonic motility and enteric \u03b1-synuclein accumulation. This review describes the main premotor symptoms that are recapitulated both in toxin- and in gene-based models, their relevance to the human disease, and their potential to understand the underlying mechanisms of early symptoms and disease progression.",

Highly-penetrant mutations in different genes (SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35, Parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1) are known to cause rare monogenic forms of the disease. Furthermore, different variants with incomplete penetrance in the LRRK2 and the GBA gene are strong risk factors for PD, and are especially prevalent in some populations. Last, common variants of small effect size, modulating the risk for PD, have been identified by genome-wide association studies in more than 20 chromosomal loci.Here, I first outline the evolution of the research strategies to find PD-related genes, and then focus on recent advances in the field of the monogenic forms, including VPS35 mutations in autosomal dominant PD, and DNAJC6 and SYNJ1 mutations in recessive forms of juvenile parkinsonism. Additional genetic determinants of PD likely remain to be identified, as the currently known mutations and variants only explain a minor fraction of the disease burden.

Genetic studies have identified a total of 18 PARK loci that are associated with PD. The SNCA gene encodes the \u03b1-synuclein protein. The first pathogenic \u03b1-synuclein p.A53T substitution was discovered in 1997; this was followed by the identification of p.A30P and p.E46K pathogenic substitutions in 1998 and 2004, respectively. In the last year, two possible \u03b1-synuclein pathogenic substitutions, p.A18T and p.A29S, and two probable pathogenic substitutions, p.H50Q and p.G51D have been nominated. Next-generation sequencing approaches in familial PD have identified mutations in the VPS35 gene. A VPS35 p.D620N substitution remains the only confirmed pathogenic substitution. A second synucleinopathy, MSA, originally was considered a sporadic condition with little or no familial aggregation. However, recessive COQ2 mutations recently were nominated to be the genetic cause in a subset of familial and sporadic MSA cases.

Additional recessive forms of parkinsonism present with atypical signs, including very early disease onset, dystonia, dementia and pyramidal signs. New techniques in the search for phenotype-associated genes (next-generation sequencing, genome-wide association studies) have expanded the spectrum of both monogenic PD and variants that alter risk to develop PD. Examples of risk genes include the two lysosomal enzyme coding genes GBA and SMPD1, which are associated with a 5-fold and 9-fold increased risk of PD, respectively.

Moreover, clinical and neuropathological study has revealed diffuse involvement of the nervous system in Parkinson's disease associated with early and/or significant clinical symptoms. Behavior manifestations in Parkinson's disease include cognitive decline and unwanted positive behaviors such as hallucinations and impulse-control disorders. The pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease can be conceptualized at multiple levels that include: (1) Molecular pathogenesis, (2) Cellular/Tissue abnormalities, (3) Neurochemical changes, (4) Site and circuit dysfunction, and (5) Network dysfunction. Currently, there is only a vague correlation with genetic abnormalities that manifest worse Parkinson's disease behavior problems, but abnormalities in misfolded proteins such as \u03b1-synuclein and A\u03b2 peptide that are increased in cortical and subcortical areas do correlate with worse behavior signs and symptoms. Both Lewy-type synucleinopathy and Alzheimer's disease pathologies, along with loss of synaptic integrity, seem to correlate with Parkinson's disease cognitive decline. Neurochemical changes of dopamine, acetylcholine, and other monoamines are associated. The frontostriate circuit is most commonly implicated in Parkinson's disease behavior. However, there is now beginning to be evidence that diffuse global network dysfunction is possibly the unifying pathophysiology from all of these level abnormalities.",

These oscillations are greatly enhanced in Parkinson's disease (PD) and there is strong correlative evidence linking beta activity at rest and beta changes in response to treatment with bradykinesia and rigidity. Some evidence that this link may be mechanistically important or causal comes from studies in which either cortical or subcortical sites have been stimulated in the beta frequency range causing modest but significant slowing of movements. However, recent trials in which high frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) has only been delivered during periods of elevated beta activity have demonstrated major clinical effects that even exceed those of standard continuous high frequency DBS. These studies suggest that beta activity may be both causally and quantitatively important in the motor impairment of PD, and demonstrate how improvements in the understanding of the pathophysiology of PD can lead to enhanced therapeutic interventions in this condition.",

The identification of a common recurrent mutation (G2019S) worldwide provides an opportunity for developing guidelines that are applicable internationally. However, the incomplete penetrance of the mutation and the lack of clarity of the pathogenicity of many other reported LRRK2 mutations call for cautious implementation of genetic testing programs. The clinical utility of genetic testing is compounded by easy accessibility of Direct to Consumer genetic services and the relative lack of regulation on reliability of service providers in internet advertisements.

They exert this function by metabolizing biogenic amine-related aldehydes, e.g. 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL), and by protecting neurons against aldehyde- and oxidative stress-related neurotoxicity. The role of these different isoenzymes has been discussed in other neurodegenerative disorders before. It is somewhat surprising that only few studies have investigated their role in the aetiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), in both the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and the formation of Lewy bodies. Earlier studies report severe alterations of the cytosolic isoform of ALDH expression (ALDH 1A1) in the substantia nigra of patients with PD. However, there are no data regarding the activity of ALDH 2 located at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Since mitochondrial dysfunctions are hypothesized to be of importance in the aetiology of PD we have examined the enzymatic activity of mitochondrial ALDH 2 in post-mortem putamen and frontal cortex of patients with PD and controls. We found that mitochondrial ALDH 2 activity in contrast to the frontal cortex was significantly increased in the putamen of patients with PD compared to controls.",

     "abstract": "The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is important for numerous biological functions, including control of movement. Oxidation of DA to highly toxic and reactive species has been hypothesized to contribute to the selective neurodegeneration observed in Parkinson's disease (PD). DA catabolism is initiated by oxidative deamination via monoamine oxidase to yield 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL). Such metabolism can be problematic as it greatly increases the toxicity of DA by production of DOPAL, known to be a toxic and reactive intermediate. DOPAL undergoes carbonyl metabolism primarily via aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzymes to a less toxic acid product. Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that cellular ALDH enzymes are sensitive towards products of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation, which are thought to be elevated during PD pathogenesis. Inhibition of ALDH and the resulting accumulation of DOPAL are concerning as DOPAL is toxic to dopaminergic cells, readily modifies proteins and causes protein aggregation. In addition, pesticides with association between exposure and PD incidence can interfere with DA metabolism and trafficking and/or ALDH activity, directly or indirectly, yielding elevation of DOPAL. Therefore, impairment of carbonyl metabolism is a potential mechanistic link between cellular insult and generation of a toxic and reactive intermediate endogenous to dopamine neurons.",

All sporadic neurodegenerative disorders are diseases of old age. This epidemiological phenomenon is consistent with a view that spontaneous conformational change from soluble, monomeric precursor protein into an insoluble amyloid aggregate is accomplished via a seeded nucleation process characterized by a long lag phase.

Though this model is based on several sound neurophysiological observations, there are major problems as well. Despite its shortcomings, however, the model persists. With the traditional focus in ET on clinical neurophysiology, there has been little research on pathological anatomy, cell biology, and molecular mechanisms, and over the years, there have been few alternatives to the olivary model. However, rigorous tissue-based studies have recently identified a series of structural changes in the ET brain, most of which are centered on the Purkinje cell and connected neuronal populations, and which may involve a partial loss of Purkinje cells. An implication of these newer studies is that ET could be degenerative. This shift in paradigm opens the door for research that aims to identify the primary set of molecular triggers and the cascade of molecular/cellular events that accompany this disease.",

     "abstract": "Many pharmacological agents may induce a variety of movement disorders, including dystonia, tremor, parkinsonism, myoclonus and dyskinesia, with an acute, subacute or more chronic time course. Motor symptoms may be isolated or part of a more extensive cerebral or systemic condition, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome or the serotonin syndrome. Drug-induced movement disorders share a number of features that should make them easy to identify, including a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset, a dose-effect, and, with the exception of tardive syndromes, complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent. Diagnosis relies on a thorough medication history. Medications commonly involved include dopamine receptor blockers, antidepressants and anti-epileptics, among many others. Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia. The present review focuses on drug-induced movement disorders that typically develop as an acute (hours to days) or subacute (days to weeks) event, including acute dystonic reactions, akathisia, drug-induced parkinsonism, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, serotonin syndrome, parkinsonism-hyperpyrexia syndrome, drug-induced tremor, drug-induced hyperkinesias and movement disorders associated with the use of recreational drugs.",

This review provides a compiled update on TS, including phenomenology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, genetic correlations and therapeutics, highlighting the emerging experience with atypical antipsychotics. The advent of atypical antipsychotics, which have lower affinity for dopamine receptors and act on 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C serotonin receptors, was expected to dramatically reduce the prevalence and incidence of this iatrogenic problem. Recent studies have shown that the reduction has been more modest than expected and TS remains an important challenge. Recent insights on pathophysiology, risk factors and genetic correlations have raised the hope for further individualized treatment for schizophrenic patients, and more strict use of antipsychotics. Up to now, there is no definite treatment for TS, but options range from relatively innocuous low doses of propranolol to more invasive procedures such as deep brain stimulation.",

     "abstract": "The precise way that tremors emerge is not well known, but there is some good information and hypotheses. This review will focus on the classic (\u201crest\u201d) tremor of Parkinson disease and essential tremor. Both have their genesis in central oscillators, which appear to be malfunctioning networks. With classic Parkinson tremor, there appears to be dysfunction of the basal ganglia network and the cerebello\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical network. There is evidence that the basal ganglia network triggers the onset of tremor and the cerebellar network is responsible for the amplitude. Since it is a tremor of stability, the beta activity of the basal ganglia may be the trigger. With essential tremor, the cerebello\u2013thalamo\u2013cortical network itself is dysfunctional and perhaps the inferior olive\u2013cerebellar network as well. This is a tremor of action, and the associated ataxia suggests that delays in motor control processing may set up the oscillation.",

     "abstract": "There is clinical evidence that the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can be ameliorated by physical exercise, and we have been using animal models to explore the hypothesis that such exercise can also be neuroprotective. To do so we have focused on models of the dopamine deficiency associated with motor symptoms of parkinsonism, including mice treated systemically with MPTP and rats treated with 6-hydroxydopamine. Our focus on exercise derives in part from the extensive literature on the ability of exercise to increase mitochondrial respiration and antioxidant defenses, and to stimulate neuroplasticity. Beginning with constraint therapy and then employing wheel running and environmental enrichment, we have shown that increased limb use can reduce the behavioral effects of dopamine-directed neurotoxins and reduce the loss of dopamine neurons that would otherwise occur. While the mechanism of these effects is not yet known, we suspect a central role for neurotrophic factors whose expression can be stimulated by exercise and which can act on dopamine neurons to reduce their vulnerability to toxins. We believe these data, together with observations from several other laboratories, suggest that exercise, as well as neurotrophic factors, is likely to be an effective neuroprotective strategy in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

Treatments to halt these disease progressions are currently unavailable. With the recent induced pluripotent stem cells breakthrough and accomplishment, stem cell research, as the vast majority of scientists agree, holds great promise for relieving and treating debilitating movement disorders. As stem cells are the precursors of all cells in the human body, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern how they develop and work would provide us many fundamental insights into human biology of health and disease. Moreover, stem-cell-derived neurons may be a renewable source of replacement cells for damaged neurons in movement disorders. While stem cells show potential for regenerative medicine, their use as tools for research and drug testing is thought to have more immediate impact. The use of stem-cell-based drug screening technology could be a big boost in drug discovery for these movement disorders. Particular attention should also be given to the involvement of neural stem cells in adult neurogenesis so as to encourage its development as a therapeutic option.",

     "abstract": "The cascade of neurotoxic events involved in neuronal degeneration suggests that it is naive to think mono-target drugs can induce disease modification by slowing the process of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD). Employing the pharmacophore of rasagiline (N-propargyl-1-R-aminoindan), we have developed a series of novel multi-target neuroprotective drugs, including: (A) drugs [ladostigil, TV-3326 (N-propargyl-3R-aminoindan-5yl)-ethyl methylcarbamate)] with both cholinesterase-butyrylesterase (Ch-BuE) and brain-selective monamine oxidase-AB (MAO-AB) inhibitory activities and (B) iron chelator-radical scavenging drugs (M30) possessing brain-selective MAO-AB inhibitor activity and the neuroprotective-neurorescue propargylamine moiety of rasagiline. This was considered to be valid since brain MAO and iron increase in PD and aging, which could lead to oxidative stress-dependent neurodegeneration. The multi-target iron chelator, M30, has all the properties of ladostigil, but is not an acetylcholinesterase (CHE) inhibitor. However, M30 has both neuroprotective and neurorestorative activities for nigrostriatal dopamine neurons in post-lesion MPTP, lactacystin and 6-hydroxydopamine animal models of PD. The neurorestorative activity has been identified as being related to the ability of the drug to activate hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) by inhibiting prolyl-4-hydroxylase. M30 regulates cell cycle arrest and induces the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin (EPO), as well as glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF). These unique multiple actions of M30 make it potentially useful as a disease modifying drug for the treatment of PD.",

Due to the advent of next-generation sequencing, the field of dystonia genetics has been evolving very rapidly over the past two years, resulting in the reporting of \u2018DYT1-25\u2019 and, for the first time, in the identification of genes associated with adult-onset focal/segmental dystonia.

Based on a recent consensus approach, dystonias are subdivided on clinical grounds into isolated (with or without tremor) and combined (with other movement disorders) forms. Confirmed genes for isolated dystonias include TOR1A/DYT1; THAP1/DYT6; GNAL/DYT25. In the combined forms, dystonia is accompanied by parkinsonism (GCH1/DYT5a; TH/DYT5b; ATP1A3/DYT12; TAF1/DYT3) or myoclonus (SGCE/DYT11). Persistent and paroxysmal forms are distinguished according to their temporal pattern.

In addition, recent reports suggest a possible role for TDP-43 mutations in parkinsonism; TDP-43 is another RNA-binding protein implicated in ALS. Given these findings we investigated the role of FUS variants in Parkinson's disease (PD). We sequenced specific regions of the gene encoding three functional domains of the FUS protein in 702 patients with PD. Our sequencing study did not identify any novel non-synonymous variant that would appear to affect the subjects\u2019 susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. These findings and previous studies have shown that variants within the FUS gene are not a common cause of PD or ET, in comparison to their role in ALS.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a devastating, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the central and peripheral nervous systems. Although recent advancements have led to a better understanding of the disorder, there is currently no long-term disease-modifying strategy. Recently, preclinical data have identified the significant effects of pluripotent stem cell grafting in 6-OHDA and MPTP animal models of motor parkinsonism; there have also been some clinical data in patients with motor parkinsonism. Pluripotent stem cells can nestle in affected organs and can differentiate into a variety of cells, including neural (dopamine producing) cells. Depending on the environment into which they are grafted, these stem cells can also influence immune responses by regulating the activity of B-cells, T-cells, and NK-cells. Pluripotent stem cells can also produce chemotrophins, including BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), GDNF (glial-derived neurotrophic factor), NGF (nerve growth factor), TGF-\u03b2 (transforming growth factor-\u03b2), IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), NT-3 (neurotrophin 3), and SCF-1 (stem cell factor 1). Influencing these trophic factors can influence plasticity. This article explores the potential of pluripotent stem cells in the treatment of PD. We will explore the utilization of pluripotent stem cells in the immunomodulation of B-cells, T-cells and NK-cells, the transdifferentiation of pluripotent stems cells into DA-cells, and the secretion of trophic factors and its relation to plasticity. We will also cover how best to conduct a clinical trial, which stem cells can be safely used in patients, what are the methods of induction before application, and how to re-apply stem cells in patients by intravasal, intrathecal or intracerebral methods. Finally, we will describe how to objectively record the clinical results.",

Neurons are post-mitotic cells and particularly vulnerable to the impairment of autophagic degradation due to their inability to redistribute damaged proteins and organelles to daughter cells.

Abnormal accumulation of iron in the brain has been implicated in several neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). Although the cause of the neurodegenerative process in PD remains unclear, recent evidence suggests that failure of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of this disease. Our studies have shown that injection of the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin in the substantia nigra (SN) of rodents causes significant loss of dopamine (DA) neurons and induces intracellular inclusion body formation, which is accompanied by excessive iron accumulation in the midbrain. In the in vitro model, lactacystin causes a marked increase in labile iron, reactive oxygen species, alteration of iron regulatory protein (IRP)/iron response element expression levels, and an increase in the aggregation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins prior to cell injury and death. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that synthetic iron chelators and a genetic iron chelator are neuroprotective against proteasome inhibitor-induced DA neuron degeneration, suggesting that iron chelation might be a promising therapeutic target for PD.",

Recently, accumulating evidence has implicated the dysregulation of autophagy as underlying the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative diseases. Using culture models of Parkinson's disease, we have investigated whether and how prototypic autophagic events occur upon exposure to N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, a dopaminergic neurotoxin, or nigericin, a K+/H+ ionophore. From these independent studies, we have found that these drugs equally induce morphological and biochemical changes typical of autophagy, including accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, appearance of LC3-II forms, and alteration in the expression and distribution of p62. Further investigation has indicated that drug-induced autophagic phenomena are largely the consequences of an impaired autophagic flux. In these cell death paradigms, we have intriguingly found that Bak, a prototypic proapoptotic protein of the Bcl-2 family, exerts a protective role via reduction of the area occupied by swollen vacuoles and appearance of the LC3-II form, whereas silencing of Bak aggravates these phenomena. Further study has indicated that a protective role for Bak is primarily ascribed to its regulatory effect on the maintenance of autophagic flux and vacuole homeostasis. In this regard, a regulatory role for calcium has been proposed.",

However, such a multispecialty approach is complex to design, and there are no evidence-based templates that describe how multispecialty care should be organized. Here we elaborate on the various challenges associated with the organization of team-based care. We illustrate this by highlighting new research evidence for two different models of multispecialty team care in PD. We also discuss several critical components of multispecialty care, including composition of the team, collaboration forms between team members, and implementation of multispecialty care within everyday healthcare settings. We close by sharing some of the lessons learned from recent clinical trials on the clinical effectiveness of multispecialty team interventions in PD. This review underscores that designing multispecialty care within the setting of a modern healthcare system is almost as complex as PD itself, and that its scientific evaluation comes with significant challenges.",

Results of this review suggest that although data on the effect of apomorphine on NMS in PD patients are limited there is a strong suggestion of a beneficial effect that warrants further investigation in double-blind studies.",

     "abstract": "Clusterin is a multifunctional chaperone protein that has repeatedly been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and, more recently, also to Parkinson's disease (PD) by both genetic and proteomic analyses. Although clusterin is detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma, studies comparing clusterin levels in PD patients and controls have been scarce and yielded conflicting data. The aim of the present study was to determine whether CSF and/or plasma clusterin levels differ between PD patients and controls and are related to disease severity. We measured CSF and plasma clusterin levels in a group of 52 PD patients and in 50 age-matched neurologically healthy controls and found that clusterin levels in CSF and plasma were not different between the two groups. Furthermore, clusterin levels in CSF and plasma were not associated with disease duration, stage or severity. CSF clusterin levels did, however, correlate with CSF levels of total tau, phospho-tau and amyloid-\u03b2-42. We elaborate on the identified correlations between levels of clusterin and AD related proteins and on possible explanations for the discrepant findings in clusterin studies in PD so far.",

Diagnostic criteria for RBD were: violent behavior during sleep and body movements or vocalization indicative of dream enacting and at least six affirmative answers in the REM sleep behavior disorder screening questionnaire. Motor function assessment was performed with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Scale part II and III (total and partial scores for tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, gait/postural instability and dysarthria).25 Patients had RBD at baseline, vs. 35 at follow-up. Three RBD changed to non-RBD at follow-up, while 10 non-RBD patients developed RBD at follow-up (annual incidence of 12.5%). RBD and non-RBD patients did not differ significantly at baseline or follow-up. The presence of RBD at baseline was significantly related to an increase in UPDRS total and bradykinesia scores over time.RBD symptoms can vary over time and have a tendency to increase during the early stages of disease. The presence of RBD symptoms could be a risk factor for motor function deterioration and particularly for bradykinesia worsening.",

     "abstract": "Whereas the motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been related to deficits in basal ganglia (BG) structures, neural correlates of cognitive changes remain to be fully defined. This study tested the hypothesis that cognitive changes in non-demented PD may be related to cortical gray matter (GM) loss.High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of the brain and comprehensive cognitive function tests were acquired in 40 right-handed, non-demented PD subjects and 40 matched controls. GM changes were assessed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) in FSL. VBM and cognitive results were compared between PD and controls, and correlation analyses were performed between those brain areas and cognitive domains that showed significant group differences.PD patients demonstrated significant GM reduction localized predominantly in frontal and parieto-occipital regions. Patients also showed reduced performance in fine motor speed and set-shifting compared to controls. Fine motor speed and set-shifting were associated with GM volume in the frontal cortex in controls, whereas these domains were associated primarily with occipital GM regions in PD patients.Non-demented PD subjects demonstrate cortical structural changes in frontal and parieto-occipital regions compared to controls. The association between typically recognized \u201cfrontal lobe\u201d function and occipital lobe volume suggested a compensatory role of occipital lobe to primary fronto-striatal pathology in PD. Further longitudinal study of these changing structure\u2013function relationships is needed to understand the neural bases of symptom progression in PD.",

We investigated the potential effect of reproductive factors on the clinical features of idiopathic PD (IPD) patients.All IPD female patients admitted to and evaluated at our Institute over a 12-month period were included in the present cross-sectional study. We investigated the effect of the following parameters by multivariate linear regression analysis: age at menarche, age at menopause, length of fertile life, duration of exposure to endogenous estrogens and cumulative length of pregnancies, use of contraceptives and hormonal replacement therapy.In total, 579 patients were evaluated and 497 reported menopause before PD onset. In this population, age at PD onset was positively associated with age at menarche and at menopause, length of fertile life and duration of estrogen exposure. Moreover, UPDRS motor score was inversely associated with age at menopause, length of fertile life and duration of estrogen exposure. Increasing age at menarche was also associated with predominant resting tremor at PD onset. In models refitted on patients with early PD (disease duration <5 years; N\u00a0=\u00a0226) all the associations found were confirmed. The relationship between surrogates of estrogen exposure and UPDRS motor score actually became more significant.Our observations support the concept that hormonal exposure of the nigro-striatal network during life may influence its susceptibility to degenerative stimuli in later life, but the association does not seem to be unique? unidirectional. In particular, increased severity of PD signs correlates with shorter duration of estrogen exposure. The underlying mechanisms need to be clarified.",

However, literature regarding successful deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment is scarce, resulting in ambiguity regarding the optimal lead location. Most cases support the ventral intermediate nucleus, but there is evidence to defend DBS of the zona incerta, ventral oralis anterior/posterior, and/or a combination of these targets. We report five patients with disabling post-traumatic tremor treated with DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus and of the globus pallidus internus.Patients were referred to the Vanderbilt Movement Disorders Division, and surgical intervention was determined by a DBS Multidisciplinary Committee. Standard DBS procedure was followed.Patients 1\u20134 sustained severe diffuse axonal injuries. Patients 1\u20133 underwent unilateral ventral intermediate nucleus DBS for contralateral tremor, while Patient 4 underwent bilateral ventral intermediate nucleus DBS. Patients 1\u20133 experienced good tremor reduction, while Patient 4 experienced moderate tremor reduction with some dystonic posturing of the hands. Patient 5 had dystonic posturing of the right upper extremity with tremor of the left upper extremity. He was treated with bilateral DBS of the globus pallidus internus and showed good tremor reduction at follow-up.Unilateral or bilateral DBS of the ventral intermediate nucleus and bilateral DBS of the globus pallidus internus may be effective and safe treatment modalities for intractable post-traumatic tremor.

Recent studies have suggested that neurochemical alterations in the cholinergic systems play a role in the development of FOG. Here, we evaluated the association between subcortical cholinergic structures and FOG in patients with non-demented PD.We recruited 46 non-demented patients with PD, categorized into PD with (n\u00a0=\u00a016) and without FOG (n\u00a0=\u00a030) groups. We performed neuropsychological test, region-of-interest-based volumetric analysis of the substantia innominata (SI) and automatic analysis of subcortical brain structures using a computerized segmentation procedure.The comprehensive neuropsychological assessment showed that PD patients with FOG had lower cognitive performance in the frontal executive and visual-related functions compared with those without freezing of gait. The normalized SI volume did not differ significantly between the two groups (1.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 vs. 1.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31). The automatic analysis of subcortical structures revealed that the thalamic volumes were significantly reduced in PD patients with FOG compared with those without FOG after adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, the Unified PD Rating Scale scores and total intracranial volume (left: 6.71 vs. 7.16\u00a0cm3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029, right: 6.47 vs. 6.91\u00a0cm3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026).

A further four patients (3%) had a more atypical presentation of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. Three months after treatment, 11 (92%) of patients with classical benign paroxysmal positional vertigo were almost or completely without complaints. We found no \u2018hidden\u2019 benign paroxysmal positional vertigo among patients without dizziness. The prevalence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo among all patients with PD was 5.3%.Among Parkinson patients with symptoms of dizziness, up to 11% may have benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, which can be treated easily and successfully.",

Visual and quantitative analyses of [18F] N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2beta-carbon ethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (FP-CIT) PET in 36 patients were performed. Seventeen age-matched normal controls were also studied.On visual analysis, 28 patients (78%) showed normal [18F] FP-CIT uptake and eight (22%) showed significantly reduced uptake, suggesting nigrostriatal dopaminergic neuronal degeneration. The reduced [18F] FP-CIT uptake was significantly associated with earlier age-at-onset of tremor and asymmetric presentation of resting tremor. On quantitative analysis, there were statistically significant differences in the [18F] FP-CIT uptake ratio in the posterior putamen between patients with reduced uptake (2.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.83) and patients with normal uptake (6.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.35) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

     "abstract": "Impaired temporal stability and poor motor unit recruitment are key impairments in Parkinsonian motor control during a whole spectrum of rhythmic movements, from simple finger tapping to gait. Therapies based on imitation can be designed for patients with motor impairments and virtual-reality (VR) offers a new perspective. Motor actions are known to depend upon the dopaminergic system, whose involvement in imitation is unknown. We sought to understand this role and the underlying possibilities for motor rehabilitation, by observing the execution of different motor-patterns during imitation in a VR environment in subjects with and without dopaminergic deficits.10 OFF-dose idiopathic Parkinson's Disease patients (PD), 9 age-matched and 9 young-subjects participated. Subjects performed finger-tapping at their \u201ccomfort\u201d and \u201cslow-comfort\u201d rates, while immersed in VR presenting their \u201cavatar\u201d in 1st person perspective. Imitation was evaluated by asking subjects to replicate finger-tapping patterns different to their natural one. The finger-pattern presented matched their comfort and comfort-slow rates, but without a pause on the table (continuously moving).Patients were able to adapt their finger-tapping correctly, showing that in comparison with the control groups, the dopaminergic deficiency of PD did not impair imitation. During imitation the magnitude of EMG increased and the temporal variability of movement decreased.PD-patients have unaltered ability to imitate instructed motor-patterns, suggesting that a fully-functional dopaminergic system is not essential for such imitation. It should be further investigated if imitation training over a period of time induces positive off-line motor adaptations with transfer to non-imitation tasks.",

Out of 216 patients, 92% and 51% were willing to undergo APD changes to therapy because of the presence/worsening of motor or non-motor symptoms.Neurologist decision to change APD therapy and patients reasons for dissatisfaction with it can be prevalently attributed to the presence/worsening of motor symptoms and motor fluctuations in the advanced stages. Non-motor symptoms were considered more often by patients. The patient educational level played a key role in treatment decision.",

     "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease the degree of motor impairment can be classified with respect to tremor dominant and akinetic rigid features. While tremor dominance and akinetic rigidity might represent two ends of a continuum rather than discrete entities, it would be important to have non-invasive markers of any biological differences between them in\u00a0vivo, to assess disease trajectories and response to treatment, as well as providing insights into the underlying mechanisms contributing to heterogeneity within the Parkinson's disease population.Here, we used magnetic resonance imaging to examine whether Parkinson's disease patients exhibit structural changes within the basal ganglia that might relate to motor phenotype. Specifically, we examined volumes of basal ganglia regions, as well as transverse relaxation rate (a putative marker of iron load) and magnetization transfer saturation (considered to index structural integrity) within these regions in 40 individuals.We found decreased volume and reduced magnetization transfer within the substantia nigra in Parkinson's disease patients compared to healthy controls. Importantly, there was a positive correlation between tremulous motor phenotype and transverse relaxation rate (reflecting iron load) within the putamen, caudate and thalamus.Our findings suggest that akinetic rigid and tremor dominant symptoms of Parkinson's disease might be differentiated on the basis of the transverse relaxation rate within specific basal ganglia structures. Moreover, they suggest that iron load within the basal ganglia makes an important contribution to motor phenotype, a key prognostic indicator of disease progression in Parkinson's disease.",

Presence or absence of bradykinesia, rest tremor and rigidity was derived from Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale part III (UPDRS-III) in five different anatomical segments: axial, right and left upper- and lower-limbs. Based on this approach, four new scores were computed evaluating the anatomical spread of the cardinal motor symptoms of PD on the five body segments over a 18-month follow-up period. The four new scores included: the Bradykinesia Segmental Score, the Tremor Segmental Score, the Rigidity Segmental Score, measuring the occurrence of each motor symptom in different segments and the Combined Segmental Score evaluating the occurrence of any motor symptom in different anatomical regions. Data were analyzed using a repeated measures analysis of variance.The Combined Segmental Score showed a significant progression over time whereas the Hoehn and Yahr and the UPDRS-III scores did not.We suggest that a simple approach evaluating the anatomical distribution of motor symptoms and their progression over the body segments may be a useful complement to the classical rating tools to assess progression in early PD.",

One family and a sporadic case had been reported as gene negative in a previous study, but they typically had preserved dopamine transporter binding and low neopterin levels in cerebrospinal fluids; thus, GCH-1 mutation had been highly suspected, which was now confirmed by repeating the genetic testing this time. An early childhood-onset patient developed choreiform dyskinesias right after administration of levodopa. The dyskinesia had lasted for more than 4 years regardless of the levodopa dosages and then subsided while maintaining levodopa.This report emphasizes the usefulness of the neopterin level in cerebrospinal fluids and dopamine transporter imaging in the differential diagnosis of DRD syndromes and a possible mechanism of levodopa-induced-dyskinesia in early childhood onset case.",

     "abstract": "The detection of cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD), at the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage, has prognostic and treatment implications. The Movement Disorders Society (MDS) has recently published criteria and guidelines for the diagnosis of possible and probable PD-MCI. In the present study we assessed the ability of the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's disease-Cognition (SCOPA-Cog) to discriminate possible PD-MCI cases from patients with PD-dementia (PDD) and from cognitively intact PD subjects. Hundred-and-thirteen consecutive PD patients underwent the MMSE, the Dementia Rating Scale and an interview on independence in daily living, and were classified as cognitively intact (n\u00a0=\u00a049), or as possible PD-MCI (n\u00a0=\u00a033) or PDD (n\u00a0=\u00a031), according to MDS criteria. Logistic regression analysis was carried out with PD-MCI diagnosis (yes/no) as an outcome variable, and age, education and the SCOPA-Cog total score as covariates. Classification of cases according to the regression model was used for constructing Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Area Under the Curve (AUC) was 0.92 [95% CI 0.86\u20130.98], for the differential diagnosis between PD-MCI and cognitively normal patients, and 0.97 [95% CI 0.80\u20131.00], for the differential diagnosis between PD-MCI and PDD. Sensitivity and specificity were 90% and 73% for the PD-MCI versus no cognitive impairment differentiation, at the cutpoint \u226524, and 93% and 97% for the PD-MCI versus PDD discrimination, at the cutpoint \u226517. The SCOPA-Cog is a quick and psychometrically sound PD-specific scale. Our findings support its use for the screening of possible PD-MCI.",

Here, we argue that an alternative way to organize health care, namely more from the patient's perspective, may help to contain costs, while improving the quality, safety and access to care. This involves a redefinition of the patient\u2013doctor relationship, such that patients are no longer regarded as passive objects, but rather as active subjects who work as partners with health care professionals to optimize health (\u2018participatory medicine\u2019). The opportunities that come with such a collaborative and patient-centered care model are reviewed within the context of patients with Parkinson's disease.

Recent studies have suggested that freezing is related to both impairments in conflict resolution as well as the processing of environmentally salient information.In this study, we utilized a virtual reality gait paradigm to investigate differences in motor outflow between PD patients with (n\u00a0=\u00a036) and without (n\u00a0=\u00a037) Freezing of Gait, as well as age-matched healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a018).

Patients with Freezing of Gait also demonstrated increased motor latency compared to non-freezers and controls specifically in response to environmentally salient triggers including narrow doorways (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03 and 0.01 respectively) and the opening of a sliding door (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036 and 0.048 respectively).

Tai Chi exercise has recently gained attention as an attractive intervention for persons with PD because of its known potential to reduce falls and improve postural control, walking abilities, and safety at a low cost. The purpose of this report is to investigate the effect of Tai Chi exercise on dynamic postural control during gait initiation and gait performance in persons with idiopathic PD, and to determine whether these benefits could be replicated in two different environments, as complementary projects. In these two separate projects, a total of 45 participants with PD were randomly assigned to either a Tai Chi group or a control group. The Tai Chi groups in both projects completed a 16-week Tai Chi exercise session, while the control groups consisted of either a placebo (i.e., Qi-Gong) or non-exercise group. Tai Chi did not significantly improve Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III score, selected gait initiation parameters or gait performance in either project. Combined results from both projects suggest that 16 weeks of class-based Tai Chi were ineffective in improving either gait initiation, gait performance, or reducing parkinsonian disability in this subset of persons with PD. Thus the use of short-term Tai Chi exercise should require further study before being considered a valuable therapeutic intervention for these domains in PD.",

We performed a retrospective study in order to identify clinical predictors of survival in clinically diagnosed progressive supranuclear palsy patients referred to our centre.Data on medical history, survival and five clinical disability milestones (inability to walk unassisted, unintelligible speech, severe dysphagia, dementia and institutionalization) were collected from outpatients' medical records and by a telephone interview to caregivers. Patients were subdivided into Richardson's syndrome and PSP-Parkinsonism according to symptoms during the first 2 years of disease. Survival was analyzed by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and Cox regression analysis.Forty-three consecutive patients were enrolled (86% Richardson's syndrome). Motor disturbances were the most frequent symptoms of onset. During the follow-up, 60.5% of patients died after a median survival of 7.1 years (2.2\u201318).

     "abstract": "Impulsive behavior and poor sleep are important non-motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD) that negatively impact the quality of life of patients and their families. Previous research suggests a higher level of sleep complaints in PD patients who demonstrate impulsive behaviors, but the nature of the sleep disturbances has yet to be comprehensively tested.Consecutive idiopathic PD patients (N\u00a0=\u00a0143) completed the Minnesota Impulse Disorder Interview and a sleep questionnaire that assessed sleep efficiency, excessive daytime sleepiness, restless legs symptoms, snoring, dreams/nightmares, and nocturia. Patients were also given a Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor examination and they completed cognitive testing.Impulsive PD patients endorsed more sleep complaints than non-impulsive PD patients. The group difference was primarily attributable to poor sleep efficiency (e.g., greater nocturnal awakenings), p\u00a0<\u00a0.01, and greater daytime sleepiness, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01, in the impulsive PD patients. Interestingly, restless legs symptoms were also greater in the impulsive PD patients, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05. The results could not be explained by medications or disease severity.Poor sleep efficiency, restless legs symptoms, and increased daytime sleepiness are associated with impulsivity in PD. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether sleep disturbances precede impulsivity in PD.",

In the present study we analyzed the relation between findings of TCS, MIBG scintigraphy, and clinical presentation in 42 patients with IPD who were clinically diagnosed and underwent clinical follow-up over \u22653 years in order to confirm IPD diagnosis throughout the clinical course. The extent of substantia nigra hyperechogenicity (SN+) contralateral to the clinically more affected body side (SNcontra) was compared to myocardial 123I-MIBG uptake. SNcontra did not correlate with the myocardial MIBG uptake (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.10; p\u00a0=\u00a00.52).

Sensitivity of TCS in the diagnosis of IPD was 79%, of MIBG scintigraphy 81%. The combination of both measurements reached a sensitivity of 95%.

LIDs were objectively rated by means of the Unified Dyskinesias Rating Scale (UDyRS) by two movement disorders specialists while examining the patients.

Lastly, the patients rated the LIDs of other reference PD patients on a video recording. The same reference video recordings were shown to 15 healthy individuals matched for age, gender and education.Seven of the 30 PD patients investigated were subjectively unaware of the presence of their LIDs. The majority of patients, however, recognized their LIDs when watching video recording of themselves. Patients displayed a specific poor self-awareness of trunk LIDs, in both the subjective evaluation and in the video recording-based subjective evaluation. By contrast PD patients correctly recognized LIDs in video recordings of reference PD patients. Poor self-awareness correlated with predominance of motor symptoms on the left body side.Poor self-awareness of LIDs is present in a proportion of PD patients as a form of anosognosia. The poor self-awareness of LIDs in the trunk is likely to be due to a complex interplay involving both anosognosic mechanisms and deficits in proprioceptive axial kinesthesia.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of orthostatic myoclonus, its clinical characteristics and the underlying associated neurological disorders.A retrospective analysis of clinical data and electromyogram surface recordings from subjects with unexplained unsteadiness/gait impairment was performed. Diagnosis of OM was made when a pattern of non-rhythmic bursts was observed (duration range 20\u2013100\u00a0ms; bursts per second \u226416).Among 93 subjects studied, OM was the most frequent disorder (n\u00a0=\u00a016; 17.2%), followed by orthostatic tremor (13.9%) and low frequency tremors during orthostatism (12.9%). All patients with OM complained about unsteadiness during orthostatism and/or during gait. Leg jerking was only observed by visual inspection during orthostatism in four subjects and two also presented falls. Eleven out of 16 patients (68.7%) with OM had an associated neurodegenerative disease, such as multiple system atrophy (n\u00a0=\u00a03) Parkinson's disease (n\u00a0=\u00a02), Alzheimer's disease (n\u00a0=\u00a02), mild cognitive impairment (n\u00a0=\u00a02) and normal pressure hydrocephalus (n\u00a0=\u00a02). Although four subjects showed improvement of orthostatic myoclonus with antimyoclonic treatment, the follow-up was not systematic enough to evaluate their therapeutic effect on OM.Orthostatic myoclonus is often underdiagnosed and can be considered a possible cause of unsteadiness in subjects with neurodegenerative diseases. Electromyography surface recording is thereby an aid for investigating unsteadiness of unknown origin.",

Health-related quality of life was assessed by the 36-item Short-form Health Survey (SF-36). Motor and non-motor variables were derived from the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale and other established scales.Multiple regression analyses showed that the non-motor symptoms strongest associated with reduced SF-36 scores at diagnosis and three years later were depression, fatigue and sensory complaints. The motor symptoms most related to impaired SF-36 scores were problems with gait and activities of daily living that cover personal needs. The variance of SF-36 mental summary scores was much better explained by non-motor vs. motor symptoms, both at baseline (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.384 vs. 0.095) and 3 years later (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.441 vs. 0.195).

Fatigue, depression, sensory complaints and gait disturbances emerge as the most relevant symptoms and should be given corresponding attention in the management of patients with early PD.",

Several patients underwent unnecessary procedures prior to being appropriately diagnosed. Over a median of 2 (3.5) years, signs and symptoms progressed to impair walking. Seven patients had improvement in gait with treatment (e.g. botulinum toxin injections, benzodiazepines, physical therapy, bracing, body weight supported gait training and/or functional electrical stimulation of the peroneal nerve) and six returned to a reduced intensity exercise routine.Isolated lower extremity dystonia associated with strenuous, repetitive exercise is relatively uncommon, but disabling and challenging to treat. The pathophysiology may be similar to task-specific focal dystonias of the upper limb.

We hypothesized that the Nintendo Wii (Wii) is a useful tool in improving motor and non-motor aspects in patients with PD, given its ability to drive functional movements and interactive nature. We enrolled twenty subjects with early to mid-stage PD in an open-label within-subjects study design where each subject was evaluated at baseline and then re-evaluated after playing the Wii three times per week for four weeks. Subjects were then re-evaluated one month later after not playing the Wii for a month to see if effects carried over. Subjects demonstrated significant improvements in the primary outcome measure (Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Test (NEADL)), quality of life (PDQ-39) and motor function (UPDRS), and a trend toward improved mood (HAM-D) after four weeks of Wii therapy. Follow-up assessments one month later showed continued improvement for quality of life and UPDRS scores. The results demonstrate that Wii therapy provides short-term motor, non-motor, and quality of life benefits in PD.

Twelve patients (6 FOG-L, 6 FOG-R) completed walking trials in two conditions (optic flow or no optic flow). Results revealed that FOG frequency was similar between groups when optic flow was not available, however, optic flow provided by walking toward an illuminated doorframe, lead to a three-fold increase in FOG episodes in only the LPD (compared to RPD).

     "abstract": "Poor nocturnal sleep is common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and negatively impacts quality of life. There is little data on how dopaminergic drugs influence nocturnal sleep in PD, particularly in relation to medication timing. We examined the association between dopaminergic medications and subjective and objective nocturnal sleep in PD.Individuals with PD were recruited from the outpatient clinic. Demographics and disease information were collected. Patients underwent one-night polysomnography and responded to SCOPA-SLEEP, a self-administered questionnaire which includes a section on nighttime sleep and an overall measure of sleep quality; higher scores indicate worse sleep. Medication intake, including medication timing in relation to bedtime, was obtained and converted to levodopa equivalents.41 Males and 21 females, median age 63.9 years, participated. Median disease duration was 5 years. After adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, and disease duration, greater total levodopa equivalent intake within 4\u00a0h of sleep was associated with higher total SCOPA-nighttime score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) and greater wake time after sleep onset (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049). Greater dopaminergic medication intake prior to sleep was also associated with less rapid eye movement (REM) sleep as a percent of total sleep time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004).Higher amounts of dopaminergic medications taken prior to sleep were associated with poor sleep quality and less REM sleep. Although poor nocturnal sleep in PD is likely multi-factorial in etiology, our findings suggest that timing and dose of medications prior to sleep need to be considered in its management.",

The total LB score, the Braak stages for neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) and the Thal phases for A\u03b2 deposition were assessed in each case, according to previously published guidelines.All the three lesion types were more abundant in the demented PD group, compared to the non-demented PD group, but neocortical LB pathology was the most important substrate of dementia. A significant correlation was found between the severity of A\u03b2 phases, NFT stages and cortical LB scores. In a subgroup of severely demented PD patients, cortical tau burden was much higher than in the rest of the group. Extensive cortical NFTs associate unavoidably with dementia. Some patients remain cognitively intact despite high cortical LB score. In conclusion, our data strongly support a combining, yet distinct role of neocortical LBs and tau deposits.",

Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids (HDLS) is an autosomal dominant disorder with symptomatic onset in midlife and death within a few years after symptom onset. Neuroimaging reveals cerebral white matter lesions that are pathologically characterized by non-inflammatory myelin loss, reactive astrocytosis, and axonal spheroids. Most cases are caused by mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) gene.We studied neuropathologically verified HDLS patients with CSF1R mutations to assess parkinsonian features. Ten families were evaluated with 16 affected individuals. During the course of the illness, all patients had at least some degree of bradykinesia. Fifteen patients had postural instability, and seven had rigidity. Two patients initially presented with parkinsonian gait and asymmetrical bradykinesia. These two patients and two others exhibited bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and tremor (two with resting) early in the course of the illness. Levodopa/carbidopa therapy in these four patients provided no benefit, and the remaining 12 patients were not treated. The mean age of onset for all patients was about 45 years (range, 18\u201371) and the mean disease duration was approximately six years (range, 3\u201311).We also reviewed HDLS patients published prior to the CSF1R discovery for the presence of parkinsonian features. Out of 50 patients, 37 had gait impairments, 8 rigidity, 7 bradykinesia, and 5 resting tremor. Our report emphasizes the presence of atypical Parkinsonism in HDLS due to CSF1R mutations.",

The range of physical activity among sedentary PD patients is unknown, as are factors that determine this variability. Hence, we aimed to (1) assess daily physical activity in self-identified sedentary PD patients; (2) compare this with criteria of a daily physical activity guideline; and (3) identify determinants of daily physical activity.Daily physical activity of 586 self-identified sedentary PD patients was measured with a tri-axial accelerometer for seven consecutive days. Physical fitness and demographic, disease-specific, and psychological characteristics were assessed. Daily physical activity was compared with the 30-min\u00a0activity guideline. A linear mixed-effects model was estimated to identify determinants of daily physical activity.Accelerometer data of 467 patients who fulfilled all criteria revealed that >98% of their day was spent on sedentary to light-intensity activities. Eighty-two percent of the participants were \u2018physically inactive\u2019 (0 days/week of 30-min\u00a0activity); 17% were \u2018semi-active\u2019 (1\u20134 days/week of 30-min\u00a0activity).

However, the variance in daily physical activity across subjects was considerable. Higher age, being female, and lower physical capacity were the most important determinants of reduced daily physical activity. Future therapeutic interventions should aim to improve daily physical activity in these high-risk patients, focusing specifically on modifiable risk factors.",

When compared with non-dyskinetic PD patients, dyskinetic PD patients showed increased volume of the inferior frontal cortex and a dysfunctional imbalance between this region and the supplementary motor area during motor task. In the current study, we investigated the impact of age at onset of the disease on the neuroanatomical characteristics of dyskinetic patients, because it is well known that early-onset PD patients usually develop dyskinesias sooner with respect to late-onset PD.Whole-brain voxel-wise investigations of gray matter volume and cortical thickness were carried out in dyskinetic (n\u00a0=\u00a033), non-dyskinetic PD patients (n\u00a0=\u00a033) and in age-sex-matched healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a040). Neuroimaging analyses were performed separately according to the age at onset (early\u00a0<\u00a050\u00a0y\u00a0>\u00a0late).Independent of age at onset, dyskinetic PD patients showed altered morphology in the inferior frontal cortex when compared with non-dyskinetic patients. Moreover, additional significant abnormalities emerged in the early- and late-onset PD patients when compared to controls. In fact, early-onset dyskinetic patients showed increased volume in a large cluster of the midbrain encompassing substantia nigra and red nucleus, whereas late-onset dyskinetic patients were characterized by abnormal gray matter increase in the supplementary motor area.Our findings demonstrate different patterns of brain abnormalities in patients with LID according to age at onset, highlighting the role of the nigral pathology in early-onset and of the cortical pathology in late-onset patients with PD.",

However, for several populations, accurate data on the prevalence and types of mutations are not available, because previous studies have not investigated the complete coding regions of these genes in large samples.We studied 312 PD patients ascertained at a single centre in Lisbon, Portugal. In 61 patients, with familial PD, we sequenced the entire open reading frames and exon-intron boundaries of LRRK2 and GBA. In LRRK2, we identified ten heterozygous p.Gly2019Ser (16.4%), and two heterozygous p.Arg1441His carriers (3.3%); furthermore, six patients each carried a novel LRRK2 heterozygous variant (five coding and one 3\u2032-UTR variants) of undetermined pathogenic role. Segregation of the p.Arg1441His mutation with PD was observed in the families of both carriers. None of these variants were identified in 138 healthy controls. Screening of GBA revealed no mutations. In the remaining 251 PD patients (25 familial and 226 sporadic) we found ten additional carriers of the heterozygous p.Gly2019Ser and no carriers of the other mutations. Thus, the p.Gly2019Ser mutation was detected in a total number of 20 carriers out of 312 patients (6.4%), including twelve familial (14%) and eight sporadic patients (3.5%).This comprehensive study confirms that p.Gly2019Ser is the most important genetic cause of PD known so far in Portugal and supports the contention that p.Arg1441His is also a PD-causing mutation. These findings have relevance for the genetic testing and counseling of PD patients in this population.",

     "abstract": "Gait dysfunction and postural instability represent a major therapeutic challenge in Parkinson's disease (PD). Gait disability in PD has been historically attributed to striato-nigral degeneration, however there is emerging evidence that multiple neurotransmitter deficits contribute to mobility impairment in PD. 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), a potent neurotransmitter modulator, has a wide range of favorable effects on gait in patients with neurological conditions including multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and cerebellar ataxia. In this Review we identify the neurobiological pathways involved in gait dysfunction in PD and discuss the mechanisms of action of 4-AP and its effect on gait related neuronal networks. The proposed mechanisms that may facilitate 4-AP favorable effect on gait in Parkinson's disease include 1) neurotransmitter release (dopamine, glutamate, acetylcholine and noradrenaline) 2) modulation of neuronal network oscillations and 3) increased cortical excitation. Recent clinical trials of 4-AP in neurological conditions associated with gait disorders will be highlighted and the importance of studying non-dopaminergic medications such as 4-AP in PD patients with gait impairment will be emphasized.",

Pubmed, Cochrane review, and web of science searches were completed on all articles addressing DBS that contained a swallowing outcome measure. Outcome measures included the penetration/aspiration scale, pharyngeal transit time, oropharyngeal residue, drooling, aspiration pneumonia, death, hyolaryngeal excursion, epiglottic inversion, UPDRS scores, and presence of coughing/throat clearing during meals. The search identified 13 studies specifically addressing the effects of DBS on swallowing. Critical assessment of the 13 identified peer-reviewed publications revealed nine studies employing an experimental design, (e.g. \u201con\u201d vs. \u201coff\u201d, pre- vs. post-DBS) and four case reports. None of the nine experimental studies were found to identify clinically significant improvement or decline in swallowing function with DBS. Despite these findings, several common threads were identified across experimental studies and will be examined in this review. Additionally, available data demonstrate that, although subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation has been considered to cause more impairment to swallowing function than globus pallidus internus (GPi) stimulation, there are no experimental studies directly comparing swallowing function in STN vs. GPi. Moreover, there has been no comparison of unilateral vs. bilateral DBS surgery and the coincident effects on swallowing function.

Ventralis intermedius (VIM) thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been shown to be effective in reducing hand tremor, but its effects on head tremor have been inconsistent.Twenty-nine DBS patients with a diagnosis of ET met inclusion criteria. All implantations targeted VIM. The factors examined included age, gender, disease duration, presence or absence of head tremor, handedness, and the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin rating scale (TRS). This analysis specifically focused on TRS head tremor sub-scores at baseline, 6 months and 12 months post-DBS. Additionally, DBS lead entry angles were examined.Twenty-three ET patients underwent unilateral DBS and six underwent staged bilateral DBS. At both 6 and 12 months following DBS, stimulation resulted in diminished head tremor (ON vs OFF; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The most important predictor of head tremor suppression was the entry angle of the DBS lead in the sagittal projection relative to the AC\u2013PC axial plane (AC\u2013PC angle). Head tremor reduction was greater among more vertical AC\u2013PC angles.A more vertical AC\u2013PC angle of the DBS lead trajectory was associated with improved head tremor suppression.

Several non-motor symptoms, including depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances, were also taken into account, as these may influence cognitive performance.The PD with VH group performed significantly worse on the Trail Making Test part A (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, immediate recall (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). In addition, PD patients with VH were more anxious, more depressed and reported more sleep disturbances. Verbal learning scores were not associated with levels of anxiety, depression or sleep disruption, whereas worse Trail Making Test A performance was associated with concomitant sleep disturbances.In non-demented PD patients, the presence of VH is associated with a cognitive profile characterized by impairments in verbal learning and probably attention. Since these cognitive functions are believed to be non-dopaminergic mediated functions, the present results support the hypothesis that multiple neurotransmitter systems, other than dopamine, contribute to the pathophysiology of VH in PD.",

Patients were classified as having normal cognition (PD-NC), mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), or dementia (PDD) using recently proposed Movement Disorder Society PD-MCI and PDD criteria. Relationships between the sleep and cognitive measures and PD cognitive groups were examined.The PD cohort included PD-NC (n\u00a0=\u00a028), PD-MCI (n\u00a0=\u00a040), and PDD (n\u00a0=\u00a025) patients. ESS scores, as a measure of daytime sleepiness, were significantly worse (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) in cognitively impaired PD patients, particularly PDD patients. ESS scores correlated significantly with Mini-Mental State Examination scores and also with cognitive domain scores for attention/working memory, executive function, memory, and visuospatial function. In contrast, PSQI scores, as a measure of nighttime sleep quality, neither differed among cognitive groups nor correlated with any cognitive measures.Daytime sleepiness in PD, but not nighttime sleep problems, is associated with cognitive impairment in PD, especially in the setting of dementia, and attention/working memory, executive function, memory, and visuospatial deficits. The presence of nighttime sleep problems is pervasive across the PD cognitive spectrum, from normal cognition to dementia, and is not independently associated with cognitive impairment or deficits in cognitive domains.",

To clarify parkinsonism related to multiple mtDNA deletions, we used 3-T\u00a0neuromelanin magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess signal changes in the substantia nigra (SN) and locus ceruleus (LC) in our patients, and compared the results to those observed in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD) (n\u00a0=\u00a035).We report the first case of a Japanese family harboring a heterozygous p.Y955C mutation in POLG1. The clinical features of parkinsonism related to the Y955C mutation in a total of 16 patients, including our two cases, are indistinguishable from iPD. However, neuromelanin MRI showed a distinct pattern in our cases compared to iPD. The neuromelanin imaging results were consistent with the neuropathological findings reported in cases of POLG1 mutations, in which neurons of the SN were profoundly affected while those in the LC were preserved.Our results suggest that 3-T\u00a0neuromelanin MRI may be useful for differentiating POLG1 mutation-associated parkinsonism from iPD, and that POLG1 mutations may cause selective neuronal loss in the SN via a mechanism different from that of iPD.",

     "abstract": "Given the heterogeneity of mild cognitive deficits in non-demented Parkinson's disease (PD), sensitive and anatomically specific behavioural measures are crucial when evaluating cognition in this patient group. Inhibitory dysfunction is one such deficit increasingly being recognised in non-demented PD; however, few clinical measures exist to detect it and its associated fronto-striatal pathology.In 50 non-demented PD patients and 27 controls we employ a novel measure, the Excluded Letter Fluency (ELF) test, to objectively assess inhibitory dysfunction. ELF results were also contrasted with an established inhibitory measure (Hayling Test) and covaried against grey matter atrophy via voxel-based morphometry analysis in a subset of patients.The findings show that patients made significantly more rule-break errors than controls on the ELF and this measure was more sensitive than the Hayling in detecting inhibitory dysfunction, classifying over 76% of patients in logistic regression analysis. Importantly, ELF rule-break errors correlated with grey matter atrophy in known inhibitory-control regions (orbitofrontal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus and ventral striatum).The ELF is a brief bedside task that efficiently detects inhibitory dysfunction in non-demented PD. The utility of this novel behavioural measure is further substantiated by its anatomical specificity for fronto-striatal inhibitory control regions.",

Striatal involvement is seen in a large proportion of cases and results in a wide variety of movement disorders. Movement disorders and cognitive problems resulting from ODS affecting the basal ganglia may occur early in the course of the illness, or may present as delayed manifestations after the patient survives the acute phase. Such delayed symptoms may evolve over time, and may even progress despite treatment. Improved survival of patients in the last few decades due to better intensive care has led to an increase in the incidence of such delayed manifestations of ODS. While the outcome of ODS is not as dismal as hitherto believed \u2013 with the acute akinetic-rigid syndrome associated with striatal myelinolysis often responding to dopaminergic therapy \u2013 the delayed symptoms often prove refractory to medical therapy. This article presents a review of the epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, imaging, and therapy of movement disorders associated with involvement of the basal ganglia in ODS. A comprehensive review of 54 previously published cases of movement disorders due to ODS, and a video recording depicting the spectrum of delayed movement disorders seen after recovery from ODS are also presented.",

However, these biomarkers have not been longitudinally assessed in combination as PD-dementia predictors. In this prospective longitudinal study, 27 non-demented PD patients underwent CSF, neuropsychological and 3-T\u00a0brain-MRI studies at baseline and were re-assessed 18 months later in terms of progression to dementia (primary outcome) and longitudinal neuropsychological and cortical thickness changes (secondary outcomes). At follow-up 11 patients (41%) had progressed to dementia. Lower CSF amyloid-\u03b2, worse verbal learning, semantic fluency and visuoperceptual scores, and thinner superior-frontal/anterior cingulate and precentral regions were significant baseline dementia predictors in binary logistic regressions as quantitative and/or dichotomised traits. All participants without baseline biomarker abnormalities remained non-demented whereas all with abnormalities in each biomarker type progressed to dementia, with intermediate risk for those showing abnormalities in a single to two biomarker types (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Both the dementia-outcome and low baseline CSF amyloid-\u03b2 were prospectively associated with limbic and posterior-cortical neuropsychological decline and frontal, limbic and posterior-cortical thinning from baseline to follow-up.

The present study aimed to correlate the SN echogenic size and striatal dopamine transporter density in MJD patients.We performed TCS in 30 subjects and SPECT with [99mTc]-TRODAT-1 in 18 subjects with MJD. Fifteen healthy subjects matched for age and gender formed a control group.

There was a significant negative correlation with regard to the SN echogenic size and the ipsilateral striatal TRODAT-1 uptake: the higher the SN echogenicity, the lower the DAT uptake in the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere.Increase in SN echogenic size likely correlates with presynaptic dopaminergic nigrostriatal dysfunction in MJD, suggesting a concurrent in\u00a0vivo pathophysiological mechanism.",

Parkinsonism was defined by the presence of bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and resting tremor, but not postural or action tremor. After discontinuing their valproic acid, improvement was seen by all patients. The course of improvement took days to months after discontinuance. Two of these patients responded to dopaminergic therapy, with drug-induced dyskinesia observed in one.

     "abstract": "Pathological gambling (PG) and other Impulse Control Disorders (ICDs), such as hypersexuality, compulsive eating and buying, are often reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). The prevalence of PG is 2.2%\u20137% in treated PD patients, which is higher than the background population rate. As other non motor symptoms in PD, PG is frequently under-reported by patients and caregivers and may be under-recognized by the treating physicians.Factors associated with PG include male sex, younger age or younger age at PD onset, personal or family history of substance abuse or ICD, a personality profile characterized by impulsiveness, and treatment with dopamine agonists (DA) more than with levodopa (l-dopa). The DA effect seems to be a class effect and not specific for any DA.Neurofunctional studies suggest that medication-induced downregulation of frontostriatal connections and upregulation of striatum might combine to induce impulsive behavior. A dysfunction of fronto-subcortical circuits in PD patients with PG is also supported by neuropsychological findings of impaired executive control and monitoring abilities.Management of ICDs in PD is complex, and until now only discontinuation and/or tapering of DA treatment seem to be an effective management strategy for ICDs in PD. There is no empirical evidence supporting the use of psychiatric drugs for PG such as antipsychotics and antidepressants. Data regarding the effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS), particularly of subthalamic nucleus, on PG and ICDs in PD are still limited and sometimes conflicting since improvement of PG or new onset of PG after surgery have been reported.",

Upon awaking in the morning some patients experience good mobility, as if they are in an \u201con\u201d state induced by medication, contrary to what would be expected after a night without medication. This intriguing phenomenon is known as sleep benefit. Here, we review the available research on sleep benefit in PD, describing its prevalence, clinical effects and determinants. We also discuss the possible mechanisms underlying sleep benefit, and the potential clinical applicability. Finally, we propose a new definition of sleep benefit to allow for improved standardization and homogeneity in future research. Important research targets include the development of objective measures of sleep benefit, as a basis for obtaining a better understanding of sleep benefit, its underlying mechanisms and its potential therapeutic application.",

RECOVER, a randomized controlled trial of rotigotine transdermal system, was the first prospective controlled trial to use the Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) as an exploratory outcome for assessment of treatment effects on non-motor symptoms in PD. Rotigotine improved NMSS total score compared with placebo, and the \u201cSleep/fatigue\u201d and \u201cMood/apathy\u201d domains. This post hoc analysis further characterizes the effects of rotigotine on sleep/fatigue and mood/apathy.Patients with PD and unsatisfactory early-morning motor impairment were randomized to transdermal patches of rotigotine (2\u201316 mg/24\u00a0h) or placebo. Treatment was titrated to optimal dose over 1\u20138 weeks, maintained for 4 weeks. The NMSS was assessed at baseline and end of treatment. Post hoc analyses are presented for individual items of the \u201cSleep/fatigue\u201d and \u201cMood/apathy\u201d domains. The interpretation of p-values is considered exploratory in nature.Of 287 patients randomized, NMSS data were available for 267 patients (178 rotigotine, 89 placebo). Within the \u201cSleep/fatigue\u201d domain there was a significant difference, in favor of rotigotine, in change from baseline score in 1 of 5 items: \u201cfatigue (tiredness) or lack of energy\u201d (ANCOVA, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

A variable proportion of patients experience decline in benefit over time, however, most studies have not been designed to describe the phenomenon of waning benefit in terms that are helpful for patient counseling. In this retrospective single center study, we define waning benefit as a phenomenon that occurs after patients begin to require reprogramming visits to optimize DBS benefit on tremor. We employed a survival analysis with time to escape (TTE) as a quantitative measure of time elapsed between implantation and the need for subsequent reprogramming. In our cohort of ET patients operated on with Vim DBS from 1994 to 2009, among 45 subjects who met inclusion criteria, 73% reported waning benefit at some point during a mean follow-up period of 56 months (range 12\u2013152 months). The mean TTE from implantation date was 18 months (range 3\u201375 months). We conclude that loss of benefit over time from Vim DBS for ET is more prevalent than previously published estimates have indicated and should be discussed during patient counseling regarding durability of expected benefit. In addition, this data suggests that a disease-based explanation rather than technical factors are more likely to explain the decline in benefit.",

We retrospectively reviewed the outcome data from all patients with DT involving at least one upper extremity who underwent DBS at Vanderbilt University from July 2006 to July 2010. We evaluated the improvement of tremor and dystonia after their response to DBS was judged to be maximal. Ten patients met the inclusion criteria. Vim was targeted in four patients and three had unilateral procedure and one bilateral Vim DBS. GPi was targeted in four patients with bilateral DBS procedure in every patient from this subgroup. A combined bilateral GPi and unilateral Vim DBS was performed in two patients. The best results for tremor control were observed in patients with Vim DBS but they had persisting mild dystonia. Patients with GPi DBS had average DT improvement by approximately 50% but their dystonia symptoms were markedly improved. We propose that the patients with DT with a mild dystonia should be considered for Vim DBS procedure and the coexistence of severe DT and dystonia may be successfully controlled by combined GPi and Vim DBS surgeries.",

Video sequences were recorded according to a standardized protocol focusing on the change of tremor amplitude during transition from rest to posture (test 1) or to a target-directed movement (test 2). These videos were assessed for rest tremor suppression by 4 reviewers (2 specialists and 2 residents) blinded to the clinical diagnosis and were compared to the personal assessment of an unblinded movement disorder specialist.Rest tremor suppression was found in 39/44 PD patients and in 2/22 patients with ET during the personal assessment. Rest tremor suppression showed a high sensitivity (0.92\u20131.00) and an acceptable specificity (0.69\u20130.95) for PD tremor in both tests. The interrater-reliability of the video-sequences was good to very good (\u03ba 0.73\u20130.91).

We documented any seizures or other adverse events associated with these studies. Crude risks were calculated per subject and per session of TMS.We identified 84 single pulse (spTMS) and/or paired-pulse (ppTMS) TMS studies involving 1091 patients and 77 repetitive TMS (rTMS) studies involving 1137 patients. Risk of adverse events was low in all protocols. spTMS and ppTMS risk per patient for any adverse event was 0.0018 (95% CI: 0.0002\u20130.0066) per patient and no seizures were encountered. Risk of an adverse event from rTMS was 0.040 (95% CI: 0.029\u20130.053) per patient and no seizures were reported. Other adverse events included transient headaches, scalp pain, tinnitus, nausea, increase in pre-existing pain, and muscle jerks. Transient worsening of Parkinsonian symptoms was noted in one study involving rTMS of the supplementary motor area (SMA).We conclude that current TMS and rTMS protocols do not pose significant risks to PD patients.

All patients underwent a clinical and neuropsychological evaluation.In agreement with previous studies, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, compared to patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls, showed a reduced gray matter volume in several cortical and subcortical areas including cerebellum, frontal, temporal and parahippocampal cortical structures.

Here we investigated the interactions between SNPs in those three susceptibility genes and environmental exposures (pesticides application, tobacco smoking, coffee drinking, and alcohol drinking) also associated with PD susceptibility.Pairwise interactions between environmental exposures and 18 variants (16 SNPs and two variable number tandem repeats, or \u201cVNTRs\u201d) in SNCA, MAPT and LRRK2, were investigated using data from 1098 PD cases from the upper Midwest, USA and 1098 matched controls. Environmental exposures were assessed using a validated telephone interview script.Five pairwise interactions had uncorrected P-values\u00a0<\u00a00.05. These included pairings of pesticides\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SNCA rs3775423 or MAPT rs4792891, coffee drinking\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0MAPT H1/H2 haplotype or MAPT rs16940806, and alcohol drinking\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0MAPT rs2435211. None of these interactions remained significant after Bonferroni correction. Secondary analyses in strata defined by type of control (sibling or unrelated), sex, or age at onset of the case also did not identify significant interactions after Bonferroni correction.This study documented limited pairwise interactions between established genetic and environmental risk factors for PD; however, the associations were not significant after correction for multiple testing.",

We evaluated whether olfactory function deteriorates with time in IRBD. Progressive smell loss could be a useful way in which to monitor the effect of disease-modifying interventions in subjects with IRBD.We conducted a prospective study in which 19 IRBD patients and 19 healthy age and sex matched controls underwent serial clinical evaluations and olfactory identification testing. We used the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) at baseline and after 1.5, 3 and 4 years, and olfactory detection testing with the Smell Threshold Test (STT) at baseline and after 1.5 and 4 years.Mean UPSIT score was lower (poorer smell identification) in patients than in controls at baseline, 1.5-, 3-, and 4-year assessments. Mean STT score was higher (poorer smell detection ability) in patients than in controls at 1.5- and 4-year evaluations. At 4 years, there were no differences between patients and controls in the rate of change of UPSIT (P\u00a0=\u00a00.093) and STT (P\u00a0=\u00a00.964) scores from baseline. Three patients were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at 3-year evaluation and one with multiple system atrophy at 4-year assessment. At 4 years, UPSIT and STT scores did not change from baseline in these four patients.In IRBD, olfactory identification and detection deficits do not worsen over time. Serial olfactory tests may not serve as an outcome measure in future disease-modifying trials in IRBD.",

All patients received twelve, 45-min\u00a0treatment sessions, three days a week, for four consecutive weeks. The Robotic Gait Training group (n\u00a0=\u00a020) underwent robot-assisted gait training. The Treadmill Training group (n\u00a0=\u00a020) performed equal intensity treadmill training without body-weight support. The Physical Therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a020) underwent conventional gait therapy according to the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation concept. Patients were evaluated before, after and 3 months post-treatment. Primary outcomes were the following timed tasks: 10-m\u00a0walking test, 6-min walking test.No statistically significant difference was found on the primary outcome measures between the Robotic Gait Training group and the Treadmill Training group at the after treatment evaluation. A statistically significant improvement was found after treatment on the primary outcomes in favor of the Robotic Gait Training group and Treadmill Training group compared to the Physical Therapy group. Findings were confirmed at the 3-month follow-up evaluation.Our findings support the hypothesis that robotic gait training is not superior to equal intensity treadmill training for improving walking ability in patients with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease.",

     "abstract": "Writer's cramp patients show poor force regulation during handwriting, but also in other experimental tasks requiring fine motor control. Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) treatment is clinically effective in a substantial portion of writer's cramp patients, but the full mechanism of action remains enigmatic. BoNT possibly influences \u03b1- and \u03b3-motoneurons through chemodenervation not only of extra-, but also intrafusal muscle fibres and might thus influence muscle spindle afferents. Hence, BoNT weakens injected muscles, but may also modulate sensory aspects of force control. Ten patients and 18 controls pressed their index finger on a force sensor tracking two visual targets: The first target consisted of five plateaus with successively higher force levels and alternated with ascending ramps. In the second target condition the same successive plateaus were to be reached by abrupt jumps. The generated force displayed as a time dependant curve. Root mean square of the difference between target and produced force level was calculated for each plateau/ramp/jump. Patients were treated with BoNT at week 4 and measured at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8. Disturbed force regulation in patients for the plateaus and the second jump at baseline resolved after BoNT treatment, and the root mean square of force deviation decreased for the ramps. Fine force control was within the 95% confidence interval of the control group after treatment. In conclusion, force regulation was disturbed in patients and improved after BoNT treatment. This is not compatible with a simple muscle weakening and might thus reflect improved sensorimotor integration.",

Six of those patients and 9 without dementia, in addition to 10 controls, were included. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation including UMSARS, neuropsychological examinations, 3T-MRI, and Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) PET imaging. The cortical thickness was assessed using surface-based morphometry.Age and disease duration were similar between MSA with dementia and without dementia, while motor disability was more severe in MSA with dementia. In neuropsychological tests, attention, visuospatial function, and language function were impaired in MSA with dementia. Mean PIB binding was similar among the three groups. Cortical thickness was reduced in precuneus/cuneus, uncus, and posterior cingulate in MSA with dementia compared to the controls, and in parahippocampal and lingual cortices compared to MSA without dementia.Dementia was found in 15% of the probable MSA patients, which was similar to those reported in previous studies. It appears that amyloid pathology has limited role in dementia in MSA, although some patients had increased cortical amyloid burden. Cortical thinning in MSA-D was observed in areas where cortical thinning was reported in Alzheimer disease or Parkinson disease dementia, but its pathological relevance is unclear. The neuropathological processes leading to the development of dementia in MSA appears to be multifactorial and heterogenous.",

Resting-state brain FDG PET imaging was performed in a cohort of 33 PD patients and 33 age/gender-matched healthy controls to identify a PDRP. PDRP expression was then computed in a new cohort of 30 PD patients and 30 healthy controls using a voxel-based network quantification algorithm. Differences in PDRP expression were compared across groups and correlations with severities of PD were investigated. As a result, we identified a PDRP characterized by relative increases in pallidothalamic, pontine, and cerebellar metabolism, associated with concurrent metabolic decreases in the premotor and posterior parietal areas. PDRP expression in each of the two PD groups was significantly elevated relative to that of the healthy controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that the PDRP-based discrimination for PD patients and controls had high sensitivity and specificity (both\u00a0=\u00a093.9%) in the derivation cohort, which declined slightly in the validation cohort (both\u00a0=\u00a090.0%) at the same diagnostic threshold. Moreover, PDRP scores correlated positively with Hoehn and Yahr scores (r\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.590, P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores (r\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.646, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in both patient groups. In conclusion, PDRP is highly reproducible in Chinese cohorts based on FDG PET imaging.

     "abstract": "In advanced Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, continuous intra-duodenal infusion of levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) is an established approach in the management of motor complications that cannot be further improved by conventional oral therapy. In general, tolerability of LCIG has resembled that of oral dopaminergic therapy; however, cases of symptomatic peripheral neuropathy (PN), sometimes severe, have been reported in patients receiving LCIG. Cases are generally a sensorimotor polyneuropathy with both subacute and chronic onsets, often associated with vitamin B12 and/or B6 deficiency. Rare cases clinically resemble Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In the absence of prospectively collected data on possible associations between LCIG and PN, it is prudent to explore potential mechanisms that may explain a possible relationship. The PN may be linked to use of high-dose levodopa, promoting high levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid or reduced absorption of vitamins essential for homocysteine metabolism. Cases of LCIG-associated PN often have responded to vitamin supplementation without need for LCIG cessation, although LCIG cessation is sometimes necessary. It may be advisable to monitor vitamin B12/B6 status before and after patients start LCIG and be vigilant for signs of PN. Prospective, large-scale, long-term studies are needed to clarify whether vitamin supplementation and routine use of a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor may help prevent PN in LCIG recipients and whether these measures should be routine practice in patients with PD on high-dose oral levodopa.",

Safinamide plasma levels were monitored during the experiments.Safinamide pre-treatment (3, 10, 20 and 30\u00a0mg/kg) dose-dependently reduced LID scores, in two acute and one semi-chronic experiment. Intensity and duration of LID were reduced and inversely correlated with safinamide blood levels. All doses of safinamide tested prolonged the duration of the beneficial antiparkinsonian effect of l-DOPA. Amantadine (5 and 20\u00a0mg/kg) reduced LID, but reduced duration of antiparkinsonian response to l-DOPA. When added to amantadine (5\u00a0mg/kg), safinamide showed no (3\u00a0mg/kg) or modest (20\u00a0mg/kg) additional beneficial effects on LID while the combined treatment prevented the reduction of the duration of the l-DOPA antiparkinsonian effect observed with amantadine only.Safinamide and amantadine reduced LID in this primate model while only safinamide increased the duration of the antiparkinsonian response of l-DOPA, suggesting that safinamide may have effects on LID that are pharmacologically distinct from amantadine, which is in current clinical use for control of LID.",

The correlation between TCD findings and the clinical outcome of the patients, which was determined by follow-up structured phone interview, was analyzed. Adverse outcome was defined if a patient died, was in bed-ridden state or had recurrent syncope (>1 per month).Two characteristic TCD findings were revealed in the MSA patients but not in the controls, i.e. a blunted cerebral blood flow velocity rebound after standing and/or sustained higher pulsatility index upon standing than supine baseline. Structured phone interview was completed in 31 of the 38 patients (mean follow-up time, 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 months). While no subject had recurrent syncope before enrollment, 12 patients developed an adverse outcome during follow-up. The coexistence of two characteristic TCD findings predicted adverse outcomes with positive predictive value 66.7% and negative predictive value 87.5%.Supine-to-standing TCD test is valuable in predicting the course of MSA with OH at early stage.

A worsening of motor function after suppressing stimulation in the \u201coff\u201d state was not paralleled by a worsening of NMF.After two years of follow-up, STN-DBS in the \u201coff\u201d medication was associated with a reduction in the frequency and severity of NMF.

We compared pain thresholds and cerebral activity in nociceptive areas using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) during nociceptive stimulation before (OFF condition) and after (ON condition) levodopa challenge between nine PD patients with and nine PD patients without neuropathic pain.Pain thresholds were determined using a cold pressor test in the two conditions. We used H215O PET to study the regional cerebral blood flow changes in subjects while they received alternate randomized noxious and innocuous cold stimuli during OFF and ON periods.Pain thresholds were not significantly different between PD patients with and without pain in either condition (OFF and ON). In both groups of PD patients, levodopa significantly raised pain threshold (F1,16\u00a0=\u00a026.71; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) with a mean variation of\u00a0\u22122.7 (\u00b12.3\u00a0\u00b0C). In the OFF condition, PD patients with pain had a lower pain activation in the right prefrontal cortex and posterior insula and a higher pain activation in the right anterior cingulate cortex (BA32/8) than pain-free patients. Levodopa significantly reduced pain-induced-activation in the right insula and in the anterior cingulate cortex in both groups.Levodopa decreased nociceptive perception in both PD patients with and without pain. In PD patients with neuropathic pain the medial affective pathway was preferentially recruited whereas pain-free PD patients exhibited a greater activation in lateral discriminative nociceptive areas.",

Changes in a long list of additional genes have been suggested as causes for parkinsonism or PD, including genes for hereditary ataxias (ATXN2, ATXN3, FMR1), frontotemporal dementia (C9ORF72, GRN, MAPT, TARDBP), DYT5 (GCH1, TH, SPR), and others (ATP13A2, CSF1R, DNAJC6, FBXO, GIGYF2, HTRA2, PLA2G6, POLG, SPG11, UCHL1). This review summarizes the clinical features of diseases caused by mutations in these genes, and their frequencies. Point mutations and multiplications in SNCA cause cognitive or psychiatric symptoms, parkinsonism, dysautonomia and myoclonus with widespread alpha-synuclein pathology in the central and peripheral nervous system. LRRK2 mutations may lead to a clinical phenotype closely resembling idiopathic PD with a puzzling variety in neuropathology. Mutations in parkin/PARK2, PINK1 or DJ1/PARK7 may cause early-onset parkinsonism with a low risk for cognitive decline and a pathological process usually restricted to the brainstem. Carriers of mutations in the other genes may develop parkinsonism with or without additional symptoms, but rarely a disease resembling PD. The pathogenicity of several mutations remains unconfirmed. Although some mutations occur with high frequency in specific populations, worldwide all are very rare. The genetic cause of the majority of patients with sporadic or hereditary PD remains unknown in most populations. Clinical genetic testing is useful for selected patients. Testing strategies need to be adapted individually based on clinical phenotype and estimated frequency of the mutation in the patient's population.",

We found that seven of the 169 neurosyphilis patients presenting with MD, had originally been misdiagnosed with Parkinsonism (4), laryngeal dystonia (1), corticobasal syndrome (1), and sensory ataxia (1). None of these patients were initially suspected of having neurosyphilis.

The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations showed that four patients were CSF-RPR positive (titers \u22641:16) by CSF syphilitic serologic testing, but all seven patients were CSF-TPPA reactive. Moreover, two patients had CSF pleocytosis and four patients had elevated CSF protein expression.

However, the 130\u00a0Hz STN stimulation was restored in 4 subjects during the following months, because of a gradual worsening of parkinsonian symptoms. A sustained efficacy on motor features and IM was observed with 80\u00a0Hz stimulation frequency in the remaining patients.In this limited cohort of STN-DBS patients, we observed an improvement of residual IM after the switch of stimulation frequency from 130\u00a0Hz to 80\u00a0Hz. However, a moderate worsening of parkinsonian symptoms was observed in a portion of patients, requiring to return at 130\u00a0Hz STN-DBS.",

There is no consensus regarding the mechanisms and classification of pain in PD. This paper reviews current data on the possible mechanisms, classifications, evaluation and potential risk factors for pain in PD. Literature searches were performed to identify clinical trials and reviews covering patho-physiology, classification, type, evaluation and risk factors associated with pain in PD. Pain in PD could be related to pathologic changes in the anatomic structures involved in nociceptive mechanisms. Studies on pain mechanisms have been mostly conducted in animals. The mechanism of pain is complicated and influenced by different factors. There are several methodological differences between the studies trying to classify pain and to characterize its subtypes. Potential risk factors for pain in PD include: age, gender, and duration of the disease. Although pain is one of the non-motor symptoms most frequency experienced by patients, it is often under recognized and inadequately treated in contrast to motor symptoms Multicenter studies are needed that include a large cohort of subjects evaluated in multiple dimensions including pain in order to obtain more data and to allow improved management of pain in patients with PD.",

We then analyzed the validity and treatment sensitivity of the shortened scale. Principal component analyses evaluated the underlying structure. Scores were compared across age, gender, trial, cognition, and country of origin. Sensitivity to change was assessed by comparing change in psychosis scores to the clinical global impression of improvement score, and effect sizes were calculated to evaluate treatment response.Nine items were selected based on face-validity and symptom frequency. Principal component analysis yielded a 4-factor structure and identified delusions and visual, auditory, and somatic hallucinations as distinct constructs. Baseline total scores were similar across study, gender, region, and age group. The clinically meaningful change in the shortened scale, defined as a 1-unit change in clinical global impression, was 2.33 points, and the effect size was\u00a0\u22120.722. The change in scores did not significantly differ between those with cognitive impairment and those without.The shortened Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms for Parkinson's disease retains the reliability, sensitivity to change, and effect size of the larger scale while reducing administration time and, more importantly, score variability.

The nature of attention deficits in Parkinson's disease has rarely been investigated with robust, theory-based tasks. The main objective of the present study was to investigate attention disorders in Parkinson's disease patients by applying a paradigm based on a model of attention. We also sought to identify the main demographic and clinical characteristics associated with attention deficits in Parkinson's disease.Eighty non-demented Parkinson's disease patients and 60 healthy controls participated in the study. Attention was assessed in a computer-controlled reaction time paradigm. The test session comprised a simple reaction time task and four choice reaction time tasks: a go/no-go task, a one-dimension, focused-attention task, a two-dimension, divided-attention task and an alternating task. Performance was assessed by composite measures: (i) cognitive reaction time, corresponding to the difference between the simple reaction time and the choice reaction time in the given condition, and (ii) reaction time variability, corresponding to the sum of the coefficients of variance of the reaction times. Accuracy was also considered.Apart from an overall slowing and greater reaction time variability, Parkinson's disease patients were only significantly impaired in the alternating condition. This set-shifting impairment was associated with their performance in the go/no-go and divided-attention conditions.Our systematic assessment of the different attentional subcomponents revealed that mental flexibility is particularly impaired in non-demented Parkinson's disease patients.",

The objectives of this study were to measure the cortical resting motor threshold (RMT) and CMCT using transcranial magnetic stimulation in patients with SCA1, SCA2, and SCA3.The subjects of this study were 32 genetically confirmed patients with SCA (SCA1\u00a0=\u00a015, SCA2\u00a0=\u00a011, SCA3\u00a0=\u00a06).

RMT was determined using standard techniques and the CMCT by \u2018F\u2019 wave method. Comparison was made with data from 32 healthy controls.Compared to controls, the patients with SCA had significantly higher mean RMT as well as CMCT (RMT: 49.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.1 vs. 41.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; CMCT: 7.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0ms vs. 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6\u00a0ms; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

We anecdotally observed that oral administration of amantadine was very effective in treating both residual and stimulation-induced axial symptoms after bilateral STN-DBS in one PD patient. Therefore, we conducted a prospective multicenter observational study to evaluate the effects of amantadine on speech, gait and balance in PD patients with STN-DBS and incomplete axial benefit. Primary outcomes were changes in speech (UPDRS III, item 18), gait (item 29) and postural stability (item 30) with amantadine treatment compared to baseline. Secondary outcome was the patients' subjective scoring of axial symptoms with amantadine compared to baseline. Forty-six PD patients with STN-DBS were enrolled in the study and followed for 10.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.21 months (median: 9.00; range: 1\u201331). The mean daily dose of amantadine was 273.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a047.49\u00a0mg.

Thirty-five (76.1%) patients reported subjective improvement in speech, gait or balance with amantadine, whereas thirty (65.2%) patients reported improvement in gait and balance. In conclusion, our data suggest that amantadine may have new beneficial effects on axial symptoms in PD patients with STN-DBS.",

Recently a splicing mutation in the same gene was reported in two brothers with juvenile parkinsonism that was not L-Dopa responsive and not accompanied by pyramidal signs or mental retardation. Also, an 80-kb deletion that included DNAJC6 sequences was identified in a boy reported as having obesity, epilepsy and mental retardation but not any signs of parkinsonism. The phenotype of our study family resembles both of those families, which among themselves do not share any clinical features.

Difficulty with DT performance may be a sensitive indicator of early Parkinson's disease (PD) impairment. The objective of this study was to assess what elements of a DT performance (cognition or gait) are most associated with impairment and disability in PD.Performance in single and DT conditions was examined in 154 PD patients. The single task assessments included the time required to walk 50 feet (gait speed) and the number of words generated in a verbal fluency task (word generation). The DT comprised simultaneous performance of the single tasks. Impairment and disability were measured with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn &Yahr, Berg Balance Scale, and Older Americans Resource and Services Scale. Age, education, and gender were control variables. Standardized residuals from regressions of DT upon single task performance were computed separately for word and gait, indicating the extent that the individual performed proportionally better/worse than predicted in DT considering their single task performance.Multiple regressions revealed that individuals who performed worse than expected in DT-word had greater impairment and disability. Dual task-gait was not significant in any model. Verbal fluency during DT performance is more closely associated with PD-related impairment and disability than gait speed during DT.This suggests that subjects prioritize gait performance at the expense of cognitive performance, and that DT word generation may be a sensitive indicator of early PD impairment and disability.",

The aim of this study was to examine the validity of the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), a self-report measure that assesses the effects of fatigue on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning, in a sample of nondemented PD patients.PD patients (N\u00a0=\u00a0100) completed the MFIS, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS-X), and several additional measures of psychosocial, cognitive, and motor functioning. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and item analysis using Cronbach's alpha were conducted to determine structural validity and internal consistency of the MFIS. Correlational analyses were performed between the MFIS and the PANAS-X fatigue subscale to evaluate convergent validity and between the MFIS and measures of depression, anxiety, apathy, and disease-related symptoms to determine divergent validity.The PCA identified two viable MFIS subscales: a cognitive subscale and a combination of the original scale's physical and psychosocial subscales as one factor. Item analysis revealed high internal consistency of all 21 items and the items within the two subscales. The MFIS had strong convergent validity with the PANAS-X fatigue subscale and adequate divergent validity with measures of disease stage, motor function, and cognition.Overall, this study demonstrates that the MFIS is a valid multidimensional measure that can be used to evaluate the impact of fatigue on cognitive and physical/social functioning in PD patients without dementia.",

Patients who showed improvement with repeated injections were evaluated during a 90-day period.Eight out of 12 patients showed significant improvement in posture after a single lidocaine injection. However, the effect subsided several days after treatment. Repeated injections produced long-term improvement in 9 out of 12 patients, which was maintained during the 90-day observation period in eight of these patients.Our results showed that repeated lidocaine injections into the external oblique improved upper camptocormia, and that the effect was maintained in the majority of patients during the 90-day observation period, indicating that repeated lidocaine injections into the external oblique have therapeutic effect on upper camptocormia in patients with Parkinson's disease.",

Based on the association between parkinsonism and restless legs syndrome, and the unique characteristics of restless legs syndrome in patients with Parkinson's disease, we suggest that the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome in Parkinson's disease differs from that in patients without Parkinson's disease.",

The search for ET genes is severely hampered by clinical and genetic heterogeneity; the existence of this heterogeneity complicates the genetic analyses. We sought to determine the prevalence and clinical features of unreported dystonia in a family study of \u201cpure\u201d ET.ET probands and their reportedly affected first-and second-degree relatives were enrolled in a genetics study, the Family Study of Essential Tremor (FASET) at Columbia University Medical Center. The goal was to enroll cases with \u201cpure\u201d ET (i.e., ET without dystonia or other neurological problems). Each enrollee underwent a detailed neurological evaluation.There were 100 enrollees (28 probands, 72 relatives). Dystonia (primarily torticollis) occurred in 9 (32.1%) of 28 families, with 5 cases in one family, 2 cases in two families, and 1 case in six families. Those affected with dystonia included 3 (10.7%) probands and 12 (16.7%) relatives. There was a gender predilection: 14/15 (93.3%) with dystonia vs. 41/85 (48.2%) without dystonia were women (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Dystonia was previously undiagnosed in 14/15 (93.3%) cases.Dystonia (esp. torticollis in women) was present in nearly one-third of the ET families in a genetics study, including 10.7% of ET probands. Dystonia was unreported and previously undiagnosed in nearly all of these individuals. The overarching biological issue is whether ET and dystonia should be regarded as one disease or two; this has obvious implications for the structuring of analyses in genetic studies.",

ET is a highly familial disorder, and physicians often care for patients who have other affected family members. Do ET families differ from one another with respect to rate of progression? Are some families slower progressors and other families faster progressors? We are unaware of published data.ET probands and relatives were enrolled in a cross-sectional genetic study at Columbia University. Rate of progression was calculated as total tremor score \u00f7 log disease duration.There were 100 enrollees (28 probands, 72 relatives). Data from 78 enrollees (23 probands, 55 relatives) were selected for final analysis. The mean familial rate of progression ranged from as little as 8.4 to as much as 34.3, a\u00a0>\u00a04-fold difference. In an analysis of variance, we found significant evidence of heterogeneity in the log rate of progression across families (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with more than one-half (i.e., 55.4%) of the total variance in the log rate of progression explained by the family grouping.Familial factors seem to affect rate of tremor progression in ET. There was a 4-fold difference across families in observed mean rate of progression; thus, some families seemed to be more rapid progressors than others. We hope these data may be used by clinicians to provide basic prognostic and family guidance information to their patients and families with ET.",

It is well-known that the diagnostic accuracy of ADL scales for Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is influenced by confounding variables such as motor worsening.To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of ADL scales for PDD.In a cohort of 106 patients (21 with dementia), we evaluated observer-based activities of daily living rating scales (e.g. Pill Questionnaire, Schwab & England Scale), caregiver assessments, and patient questionnaires (e.g. Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale).Each inventory showed moderate or even high specificity for dementia (>75.3%). Sensitivity was highest for the Pill Questionnaire (90.5%). Interestingly, the ratings of caregivers and trained clinical observers overestimated the presence of dementia.Standardized activities of daily living assessments like the Pill Questionnaire accompanied by neuropsychological testing can be a helpful tool for the diagnosis of PDD.

The reported benefit ranges widely, but the majority of cases experienced at least a 50% improvement in symptoms.

A wide variety of voltages, frequencies, and pulse widths have demonstrated efficacy. A small number of reports which examined psychiatric symptoms before and after surgery did not find any decline, and in some cases revealed improvement in mood.

Factors associated with PPX effectiveness were examined: the ratio of REM sleep without atonia to total REM sleep (RWA/REM), length of RBD morbidity, frequency of vocalization or abnormal behavior, and Sniffin' Stick Test scores. These factors were also compared among the responders to PPX monotherapy, CNZP monotherapy, and PPX\u00a0+\u00a0CNZP combined therapy.PPX was efficacious in 61.7% (50/81) of the subject patients.

Responders to PPX\u00a0+\u00a0CNZP combined therapy showed significantly higher RWA/REM and frequency of vocalization or dream enactment behavior than either responders to monotherapy with PPX or to CNZP.PPX is probably applicable as an alternative to CNZP, especially for mild iRBD cases with a lower rate of RWA.

Functional connectivity from the posterior putamen bilaterally and rostral supplementary motor area was used to explore network interactions in the subjects.Both the asymptomatic carriers and patients had decreased connectivity within the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortical motor loop compared to controls. The asymptomatic carriers showed extensively increased connectivity compared to controls, including the cortico-cortical motor, cortico-cerebellar, cortico-brainstem, and part of the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortical motor circuits. In contrast, the connectivity of most of these networks was decreased in the patients. These abnormalities were relatively normalized after levodopa administration.In the preclinical stage of SCA2 parkinsonism, the connectivity of a part of the basal ganglia motor loop is weakened as a consequence of dopaminergic deficits; meanwhile, the connectivity of other large-scale brain networks is strengthened presumably to compensate for the dysfunction of the basal ganglia to maintain brain function in the early stage of dopaminergic deficits. The simultaneous effects of progressive disruption of basal ganglia motor circuits and failure of compensatory mechanisms as dopaminergic dysfunction progresses may contribute to the onset of clinical symptoms.",

LICI was weaker and increasing stimulation intensity had a lower effect on SP duration in dyskinetic patients than in controls. In dyskinetic patients, in contrast to non-dyskinetic patients, levodopa failed to increase SICI and SP duration, and potentiated to a lesser extent the effect of increasing the stimulation intensity on LICI. Although levodopa improved motor symptoms to a similar extent in both dyskinetic and non-dyskinetic patients, it failed to activate effectively the excitability of the inhibitory systems in dyskinetic patients.These findings suggest that dyskinesia is associated with an abnormal effect of levodopa on cortical motor inhibitory circuits.",

We also assessed the influence of medication continuation on clinical outcome measures, such as the Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Rating Scale, and the 36 item short-form health quality of life survey.Both unilateral and bilateral deep brain stimulation resulted in a decrease in primidone use (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0082, 0.046, respectively), and bilateral deep brain stimulation patients used less tremor suppressing medications 36 months following surgery (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

Drivers with PD reported more self-restrictions (higher SDA scores, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01; lower SDF scores, p\u00a0<\u00a0.05), yet drove more at night, in bad weather, in rush hour and on highways than they reported.

Therefore, the purpose of the present study has three aims: examine the turning gait kinematics in freezers, evaluate the prevalence of FOG at different turn angles, and characterize whether the specific turning strategies employed by PD patients might be associated with turning deficits.20 PD participants (10 freezers, 10 non-freezers) and 10 healthy controls walked down a 6-m pathway and completed randomized trials of 0\u00b0, 90\u00b0, 120\u00b0, and 180\u00b0 turns.Spatiotemporal gait kinematics were analysed using motion capture, while presence of FOG and classification of turn types (step out, crossover, or mixed strategy) were identified by two independent raters using video analysis.Freezers significantly increased step time variability and elicited more freezing episodes at sharper turns. Healthy controls consistently implemented a crossover turning strategy for all turning angles, while freezers tended to use a step out and mixed strategy especially during 180\u00b0 turns. This strategy in freezers was associated with a failure to increase step width (as healthy controls do). Additionally, in contrast to healthy controls and non-freezers, a dramatic decrease in velocity was identified in freezers for all turning angles.Freezing episodes are associated with a deficit in controlling gait timing. Additionally, freezers fail to increase step width despite employing a safer turn strategy.",

     "abstract": "To determine the demographic distribution of Young Onset Parkinson's Disease (YOPD) in the United States and to quantify the burden of neuropsychiatric disease manifestations.Cross sectional study of 3,459,986 disabled Americans, aged 30\u201354, who were receiving Medicare benefits in the year 2005. We calculated race and sex distributions of YOPD and used logistic regression to compare the likelihood of common and uncommon psychiatric disorders between beneficiaries with YOPD and the general disability beneficiary population, adjusting for race, age, and sex.We identified 14,354 Medicare beneficiaries with YOPD (prevalence\u00a0=\u00a0414.9 per 100,000 disabled Americans). White men comprised the majority of cases (48.9%), followed by White women (34.7%), Black men (6.8%), Black women (5.0%), Hispanic men (2.4%), and Hispanic women (1.2%). Asian men (0.6%) and Asian women (0.4%) were the least common race\u2013sex pairs with a YOPD diagnosis in this population (chi square, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Compared to the general population of medically disabled Americans, those with YOPD were more likely to receive medical care for depression (OR: 1.89, 1.83\u20131.95), dementia (OR: 7.73, 7.38\u20138.09), substance abuse/dependence (OR: 3.00, 2.99\u20133.01), and were more likely to be hospitalized for psychosis (OR: 3.36, 3.19\u20133.53), personality/impulse control disorders (OR: 4.56, 3.28\u20136.34), and psychosocial dysfunction (OR: 3.85, 2.89\u20135.14).Young Onset Parkinson's Disease is most common among white males in our study population. Psychiatric illness, addiction, and cognitive impairment are more common in YOPD than in the general population of disabled Medicare beneficiaries. These may be key disabling factors in YOPD.",

Herein, we test the effectiveness of visual information while treating swallowing disturbances in patients with PD.Forty two non-demented PD patients with swallowing disturbances were randomly divided into two groups. An experimental group received video-assisted swallowing therapy (VAST) and a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a021) was given conventional therapy. Both groups were given 6 interventional sessions by the same speech and swallowing therapist. Patients in the VAST group were exposed to video of the swallowing process in general as well as of their own, as part of all therapy sessions. Swallowing function was assessed before and post-intervention by fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Quality of life, quality of care and the degree of pleasure from eating were also assessed by questioners pre and post-intervention.There was a significant improvement in swallowing functions following both interventions. The FEESs demonstrated a significantly greater reduction in food residues in the pharynx in the VAST group compared to the conventional treatment group. There were significant group improvement in some parameters of the quality of life, quality of care and pleasure of eating scales.In cognitively intact patients with PD with swallowing disturbances VAST was associated with improved swallowing related QOL and less food residues in the pharynx.",

The amplitude and latency of event-related potentials were compared between groups.No group differences were found for reaction times or accuracy. A Group effect was found for P2 wave amplitude; patients with rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder had increased P2 in comparison with the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Patients with Parkinson's disease alone were not different from the two other groups for this component.

Although patients with Parkinson's disease alone were not significantly different from patients with combined Parkinson's disease and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, their P2 amplitudes were not sufficiently abnormal to differ from that of control subjects.

Internal consistency of the modified UPDRS (mUPDRS) was measured using Cronbach's alpha, and concurrent validity was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between the standard motor UPDRS and mUPDRS.The mUPDRS versus standard motor UPDRS is cross-sectionally (ICC\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.92) and longitudinally (ICC\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.92) reliable for both treatment groups.

The\u00a0statistical analysis of our data using Kendall's tau-b and intra-class correlations shows that (a) ranking patient videos based on severity is suitable for studying the utility of the SVS, and (b) SVS exhibits moderate utility to quantify dyskinesia severity when compared to manual assessment of dyskinesia by neurologists using the UDysRS. These results support the effective use of SVS as an objective measure to quantify dyskinesia and the rationale for a ranking system that complements traditional rating scales.",

The pathogenesis is multifactorial and the mechanism of PD metabolism control is unresolved. This cross-sectional study aimed to ascertain the relationship between rest energy expenditure (REE), PD duration, Hoehn & Yahr (H&Y) stage, drug therapy and body mass index (BMI), in order to determine possible predictors of weight loss.We studied fifty-eight PD subjects, after excluding conditions with a known influence on metabolism and weight (severe tremor, dyskinesias, dementia, fever, on-going infections, thyroid disease, and dysphagia). Subjects underwent REE measurement, through indirect calorimetry, in both the OFF state (12\u00a0h fasting and off medications) and in the ON state (60\u00a0min after taking dopaminergic drugs).OFF state. In the majority of PD patients REE values did not differ from those expected (based upon age, gender and BMI), being significantly higher in subjects in H&Y stage IV than H&Y stage II (t\u00a0=\u00a03.5; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Disease duration and rigidity were significantly associated with increased REE (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.31, F\u00a0=\u00a03.6; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0045). ON state. REE decreased by approximately 8% in all subjects, irrespective of disease duration or H&Y stage. BMI was inversely related to disease duration and UPDRS motor score in the OFF state and directly related to UPDRS motor score in the ON state (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.333, F\u00a0=\u00a03.5; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).In PD REE increases as a function of disease duration; its adverse role in the decrease in BMI seems to be compensated for by dopaminergic medication.",

Three promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs35652124, rs6706649, and rs6721961 were examined using polymerase chain reaction and restriction analysis. The associations of each of the SNPs and the haplotypes constructed by the variations with PD susceptibility were examined.

Recent studies have suggested that the mechanisms underlying development and expression of LID in PD may involve epigenetic changes that include deacetylation of striatal histone proteins. We hypothesised that inhibition of histone deacetylase, the enzyme responsible of histone deacetylation, would alleviate LID.Four female common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) were rendered parkinsonian by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Following stabilisation of the parkinsonian phenotype, marmosets were primed to exhibit dyskinesia with chronic administration of l-DOPA. We then investigated the effects of the brain-penetrant histone deacetylase inhibitor, RGFP109 (30\u00a0mg/kg p.o. once daily for 6 days), on LID and l-DOPA anti-parkinsonian efficacy.RGFP109 had no acute effects on dyskinesia after single or 6 days once-daily treatment (both P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). However, one week following cessation of RGFP109, dyskinesia and duration of ON-time with disabling dyskinesia were reduced by 37% and 50%, respectively (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), compared to that seen previously with l-DOPA alone. There was no change in anti-parkinsonian actions of, or ON-time duration afforded by, l-DOPA (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).Histone deacetylation inhibition may represent a novel approach to reverse established LID in PD and improve quality of the anti-parkinsonian benefit provided by l-DOPA.",

The retina is the most distal locus of visual dysfunction in PD as shown by electroretinographic (ERG) and optical coherence tomographic (OCT) studies. Thinning of the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and the fovea has been reported in PD. This review summarises retinal physiology and foveal visual dysfunction in PD and quantification of retinal thinning as reported in different studies and using different instruments. At this point due to methodological diversity and relatively low number of subjects studied, a meta-analysis is not yet possible. Results obtained on one equipment are not yet transferable to another. The author also briefly alludes to some links of visual processing deficits beyond visual detection, such as visual discrimination, visual categorisation and visuospatial orientation in PD.There are some promising results suggesting the potential applicability of ST-Oct as a biomarker in PD. Furthermore, these data raise some interesting neurobiological questions. However, there are identifiable pitfalls before OCT quantification may be used as a biomarker in PD. Analysis standardisation is needed on a larger than existing healthy and patient population. Furthermore, longitudinal studies are needed. The exact relationship between retinal foveal deficits and visuo-cognitive impairment in PD remains a challenging research question.",

Intriguingly, we identified a de novo MAPT p.S285R mutation. All six patients with early-onset PSP and the abnormal eye movements that are not typical of sporadic PSP had MAPT mutations. The gene dosages of MAPT and PGRN were normal.MAPT p.S285R is the first reported de novo mutation in a sporadic adult-onset patient. MAPT mutation analysis is recommended in both familial and sporadic patients, especially in early-onset PSP patients with these abnormal eye movements.

     "abstract": "Mutations in the phospholipase A2 Group 6 (PLA2G6) gene have been identified in autosomal recessive neurodegenerative diseases classified as infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy and neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation. Recently, PLA2G6 was also reported as the causative gene for early-onset PARK14-linked dystonia-parkinsonism.To address whether PLA2G6 mutations are also an important cause of PD, we screened sequence variants of PLA2G6 in 250 PD patients and 550 controls in a Chinese Han populations. We identified four sequence changes: a coding synonymous c.1959T>A transition of exon13 in one patient, two missense mutations c.1966C>G in exon13 and c.2077C>G in exon14 in two different patients, which caused two amino acids change Leu656Val and Leu693Val respectively. We also found a frame-shift mutation P.His597fx69 in exon 12 in one patient. These four rare variants were not represented in 550 control individuals. Furthermore, we found that WT PLA2G6 enzyme hydrolyzed phospholipids while mutant PLA2G6 with P.His597fx69 frame-shift caused loss of enzyme activity, exhibiting less than 6% of the specific activity in phospholipase assays compared to that of WT PLA2G6. Mutant PLA2G6 with Leu656Val and Leu693Val decreased their activity by 45% and 35% in phospholipase assay respectively.We identified four rare PLA2G6 mutations in 250 PD patients, enlarging the spectrum of PLA2G6 mutations in PD. Although PLA2G6 mutations account for only a small fraction of PD patients in Chinese populations, these mutations impair catalytic activity of their phospholipids-hydrolyzing function. These results indicate that PLA2G6 mutations maybe PD-causing in Chinese Han populations.",

In\u00a0vivo documentation of cardiac AS pathology is lacking.To prospectively assess the presence of AS aggregates in epicardial fat tissue from living subjects without parkinsonism undergoing elective cardiac surgery.Epicardial fat tissue obtained during cardiac surgery from 91 subjects was studied by histology and immunohistochemistry. Areas more likely to contain pANS elements were selected. PD-related motor and non-motor symptoms (NMS) were assessed immediately before or after surgery.Small autonomic nerves, ganglia and/or tyrosine-hydroxylase positive fibres were identified in epicardial fat in each of the 91 subjects (62 male/29 female, mean age 67 years). AS aggregates were detected in 7 subjects (7.7%), and were more frequent in those aged above 70 years. In AS-positive subjects constipation and acting dreams were significantly more frequent than in the AS-negative ones.AS aggregates occur in epicardial pANS in subjects without parkinsonism, suggesting the diagnosis of iLBD. The presence in some of these subjects of non-motor symptoms such as acting dreams and constipation known to occur in premotor PD supports this interpretation. Adequate follow-up of the subjects in this study will indicate the time, if any, to progression to motor PD.",

Kinematic data were recorded with a 3D ultrasound movement analysis system (CMS 70 P4-V5, Zebris, Germany).The effect of subthalamic stimulation was accentuated during the reach phase compared to the grip formation during the composed movement. Stimulation induced kinematic changes of the composed movement were comparable to those of both isolated submovements.Subthalamic stimulation improved certain aspects of all three hand movement types but did not differentially impact the composed reach-to-grasp task compared to the simple submovements. We assume that the complete reach-to-grasp task is encoded in a single generalised motor program which is affected by stimulation.",

A post hoc analysis of data from these pivotal trials was carried out to compare the adverse event (AE) profiles of younger and older patient populations. Data from early and advanced PD trials were separately pooled and evaluated using two age cut-offs (<65 vs. \u226565 years; <75 vs. \u226575 years). For most AEs, no age-related differences in incidence were observed. In the early PD pool, nausea (38% vs. 30%) and headache (15% vs. 9%) were more frequent in younger (<65 years) compared with older (\u226565 years) patients using the 65-year age cut-off.

PD has been shown to exhibit abnormal central pain processing, although underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood. In order to investigate this further, we assessed PD patients by specific A\u03b4 stimulation with intra-epidermal needle electrode and determined olfactory function.Forty-two patients (18 males and 24 females) with PD and 17 healthy control subjects (8 males and 9 females) were studied. A thin needle electrode was used to stimulate epidermal A\u03b4 fibers, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) recorded at the vertex. Olfactory function was evaluated using the Odor Stick Identification Test for Japanese (OSIT-J) and its relationship with pain-related SEPs was investigated.There were no significant differences in N1 latencies or P1 latencies although N1/P1 peak-to-peak amplitudes were significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in PD patients than in control subjects. In PD patients, there were significant correlations between N1/P1 amplitudes and disease duration (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.35, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), Hoehn-Yahr stage (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.38, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and UPDRS part III (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.42, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

     "abstract": "Smoking is a well documented environmental factor that reduces susceptibility to Parkinson's disease (PD). Several genetic variants within the nicotinic cholinergic receptor gene cluster, CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 have been reported to be associated with nicotine dependence (ND), and this association has been validated in multiple studies.Due to the inverse correlation between smoking and PD susceptibility, we investigated whether ND-related genetic variants are associated with age at onset (AAO) of PD among smokers.We performed a genetic association study in a sample of 677 Italian PD patients, ages 34\u201376. 438 had never smoked (NS), and 239 were current or past smokers (ever-smokers, ES). Three independent SNPs within the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster (rs588765, rs16969968, rs578776) were analyzed for association with AAO.We demonstrated an interaction between the rs588765 SNP and smoking status (NS vs. ES) that was nominally significant in its effect on PD AAO (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). The rs588765 ND risk allele \u2018C\u2019 was associated with delayed AAO among ES (even when smoking intensity variables are accounted for), but had no significant effect among NS. In the ES group, a dominant model of inheritance was observed: carriers of the \u2018CC\u2019 genotype presented delayed AAO compared to carriers of the \u2018CT\u2019 or \u2018TT\u2019 genotypes.Our preliminary results suggest that the ND risk variant, rs588765, has a protective effect in PD, and is associated with later AAO, but only when the individual was previously exposed to nicotine. This may be explained by modulating the neuroprotective effect of chronic nicotine exposure against striatal dopaminergic damage. Further validation studies in additional populations are required.",

Current CBD diagnostic criteria outline features of CBS but fail to distinguish CBD from other causative pathologies.To characterise the CBS presentation of sCJD (sCJD-CBS) in the context of existing CBD diagnostic criteria.Data of two new cases of sCJD-CBS and seven patients identified from the Australian National Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Registry database was reviewed.

Comparison was made with pathologically diagnosed CBD cases with ante-mortem CBS presentation (CBD-CBS).sCJD-CBS accounts for 1.8% of all Australian sCJD cases. Compared to CBD-CBS, disease progression is more rapid in sCJD-CBS (median time to diagnosis 48 vs.1.5 months, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; and disease duration until death 68 vs. 5 months, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

     "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated both clinical and neurochemical similarities between Parkinson's disease (PD) and narcolepsy. The intrusion of REM sleep into the daytime remains a cardinal feature of narcolepsy, but the importance of these intrusions in PD remains unclear. In this study we examined REM sleep during daytime Maintenance of Wakefulness Testing (MWT) in PD patients.Patients spent 2 consecutive nights and days in the sleep laboratory. During the daytime, we employed a modified MWT procedure in which each daytime nap opportunity (4 per day) was extended to 40\u00a0min, regardless of whether the patient was able to sleep or how much the patient slept. We examined each nap opportunity for the presence of REM sleep and time to fall asleep.Eleven of 63 PD patients studied showed 2 or more REM episodes and 10 showed 1 REM episode on their daytime MWTs. Nocturnal sleep characteristics and sleep disorders were unrelated to the presence of daytime REM sleep, however, patients with daytime REM were significantly sleepier during the daytime than those patients without REM. Demographic and clinical variables, including Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores and levodopa dose equivalents, were unrelated to the presence of REM sleep.A sizeable proportion of PD patients demonstrated REM sleep and daytime sleep tendency during daytime nap testing. These data confirm similarities in REM intrusions between narcolepsy and PD, perhaps suggesting parallel neurodegenerative conditions of hypocretin deficiency.",

We compared the frequency of levodopa-related fluctuation as identified by the WOQ-19 with recognition by neurologists. We compared patients with both motor and non-motor fluctuations with those who only had motor fluctuations. Non-motor fluctuations were separated into psychiatric, autonomic, and sensory categories for further analysis.The patients' average age was 70.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4 years (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) and disease duration was 6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0 years. The frequency of motor fluctuations was 69% and for non-motor fluctuation 40%. Fifty-three percent of patients with motor fluctuations also had non-motor fluctuations, whereas 93% of patients with non-motor fluctuations also had motor fluctuations. The WOQ-19 showed a sensitivity of 82% but a specificity of only 40%. The patients with both non-motor and motor fluctuations exhibited more severe motor symptoms, more non-motor symptoms and higher levodopa daily doses (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Patients had significantly higher fluctuation rates if they had psychiatric (49%) and sensory (45%) symptoms than patients with autonomic symptoms (32%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Forty-eight percent of patients with non-motor fluctuations exhibited more than one type of non-motor fluctuation.Forty percent of PD patients presented with non-motor fluctuations, and almost half of these exhibited more than one type. Appropriate recognition of levodopa-related fluctuations, both motor and non-motor, can lead to treatment modifications in PD patients.",

Recent studies demonstrated that pathological oscillations are seen largely within the dorsolateral portion of the STN, which is the same location that predicts optimal therapeutic benefit with DBS; however, the precise nature of the relationship between these two phenomena remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore localization of oscillatory activity in relation to the optimal contacts of DBS which results in the best motor improvement. We studied 23 PD patients who underwent electrode implantation into the STN for motor symptoms.Microelectrode recordings were taken from the STN during surgery and neuronal activity was analyzed offline. Spectral characteristics were calculated. Clinical outcomes were evaluated pre- and post-STN DBS implantation using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS III). The position of optimal electrode contacts was assessed by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and was compared to the location of oscillatory activity within the STN as well as its dorsal margin (where STN neuronal activity was first detected). Of the total 188 neurons obtained, 51 (27.1%) neurons showed significant oscillatory activity. Of those, 47 (92.2%) were localized in the dorsal portion of the STN. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the averaged coordinates of the position of 40 optimal contacts and the coordinates of the dorsal margin of the STN. The data indicate that the positions of the best contacts correlate with the locations of the oscillatory neurons supporting the prediction that stimulation of the dorsolateral oscillatory region leads to an effective clinical outcome for STN DBS surgery.",

Recently, we demonstrated that this clinical phenotype is associated with an abnormal gray matter increase in the prefrontal cortex when compared to PD without LID. This evidence was found by using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). However, VBM may not be the most appropriate procedure to assess cortical pathology, since its normalization/smoothing steps reduce the ability to anatomically characterize sulci and gyri. The aim of this study is to better delineate the LID-related anatomical abnormalities by using an advanced neuroimaging method that provides a direct and objective measure of the cortical morphology.Surface-based investigation of cortical mantle (cortical thickness) was carried out by using Freesurfer in two groups of treated PD patients with LID (no 29) and without LID (no 30), and one group of age- and sex-matched controls (no 24).Cortical thickness analysis revealed a pronounced increase of thickness in the right inferior frontal sulcus in PD patients with LID with respect to PD patients without LID.The current study confirms our previous morphological findings on the role of the prefrontal cortex in the pathophysiology of LID and delineates with more precision the anatomical abnormalities characterizing this clinical phenotype.",

Both performance on the TUG and PIGD score were weakly associated with working memory and response generation (semantic and phonemic fluency). TUG also correlated with semantic fluency when corrected for disease severity and age. These results indicate that response generation and working memory are associated with (and possibly also causally related to) gait and balance deficits.

Accumulating evidence from several Parkinson\u2019s disease cohorts of varying ethnicities suggests that glucocerebrosidase mutations even in the heterozygous state (carriers) may be a susceptibility factor for Parkinson\u2019s. Very few studies have analyzed the frequency of Parkinson\u2019s in carriers and individuals with Gaucher disease.To determine frequency of Parkinson\u2019s in patients with Gaucher disease and obligate carriers of glucocerebrosidase mutations and compare it with a control group.A questionnaire was completed by 100 Ashkenazi Jewish Gaucher patients followed at our center and 109 ethnicity-matched controls with no personal or family history of Gaucher disease.Frequency of Parkinson\u2019s was higher in Gaucher patients (8/100) than in controls (0/109; P\u00a0=\u00a00.0024). Frequency of Parkinson\u2019s in obligate carriers (11/200) was higher than controls (6/218), but the difference was not statistically significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.215). Average age of onset of Parkinson\u2019s was earlier in Gaucher patients (57.2) than the general population and in obligate carriers (60) when compared with controls (76.8; P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). The L444P genotype was more frequent in Gaucher patients who reported a parent with Parkinson\u2019s (36.40%) than those who did not (4.50%).Our study suggests that the risk for developing Parkinson\u2019s may be higher in affected versus carriers of glucocerebrosidase mutations and suggests that L444P may pose a higher risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s than other mutations.

The aim of the current study was to evaluate cZi DBS in tremor-dominant Parkinson's disease.14 patients with predominately unilateral tremor-dominant PD and insufficient relief from pharmacologic therapy were included and evaluated according to the motor part of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). The mean age was 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1 years and the disease duration 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7 years. Thirteen patients were operated on with unilateral cZi DBS and 1 patient with a bilateral staged procedure. Five patients had non-L-dopa responsive symptoms. The patients were evaluated on/off medication before surgery and on/off medication and stimulation after a minimum of 12 months after surgery.At the follow-up after a mean of 18.1 months stimulation in the off-medication state improved the contralateral UPDRS III score by 47.7%. Contralateral tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia were improved by 82.2%, 34.3%, and 26.7%, respectively. Stimulation alone abolished tremor at rest in 10 (66.7%) and action tremor in 8 (53.3%) of the patients.Unilateral cZi DBS seems to be safe and effective for patients with severe Parkinsonian tremor. The effects on rigidity and bradykinesia were, however, not as profound as in previous reports of DBS in this area.",

The neuropsychological performance of 94 patients with PD was compared with that of 84 healthy controls (HCs) and available normative data, using a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment including tests of executive, memory, psychomotor speed, attention, visuospatial, and language functions. Our results showed that PD patients performed significantly worse on executive function (i.e., category of card sorting) and psychomotor speed (i.e., processing speed index). Up to 46.8% were classified as PD-MCI and the majority of those having single-domain impairment (68.2%); 9.6% met the consensus diagnostic criteria for PDD. Accordingly, we suggest that early-stage PD patients have cognitive dysfunction predominately in the anterior brain.

Available comorbidity data included six common conditions (heart/circulation problems, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, respiratory disease, and other neurologic disease) that were clinician-rated for presence and severity. Available cognitive measures included semantic fluency and a 5-word recall memory task. The unique effects of comorbidities on cognition were analyzed (multiple hierarchical regression) controlling for demographic, PD disease severity (duration, Hoehn-Yahr), and medication status.The two most reported comorbidities were arthritis (46.6%) and heart/circulation problems (36.3%), with diabetes affecting 9% of the sample. Severity of heart/circulation problems independently contributed to worse delayed recall performance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). A trend emerged for more severe diabetes as contributing to worse semantic fluency scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06).This study with a large cohort of PD patients provides evidence for a small detrimental influence of specific health comorbidities, particularly heart/circulatory and diabetes, on general measures of cognition. This effect is present, above and beyond the influences of basic demographic information (age), duration and staging of PD, and medication status.

Because these investigations have never been performed in secondary dystonia due to Pantothenate-Kinase Associated Neurodegeneration, we report our results in a small group of such patients from the Dominican Republic.Functional magnetic resonance imaging was carried out in 7 patients with a genetically confirmed mutation of the PANK2 gene and a non-affected control group (matched pairs) using an event-related motor activation paradigm (hand movements).Compared to the control group (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01), patients showed a larger amount of activated voxels starting in the contralateral cerebellum and contralateral premotor cortex 2\u00a0s before the actual hand movement. Whereas these \u201chyperactivations\u201d gradually diminished over time, activations in the contralateral primary motor cortex and the supplementary motor area peaked during the next second and those of the contralateral putamen at the time of the actual hand movement. In a multiple regression analysis, all these areas correlated positively with the degree of dystonia of the contralateral arm as judged by the Burke\u2013Fahn\u2013Marsden-scale (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001).As in other forms of dystonia, the increased activations of the motor system found in our patients could be related to the origin of the dystonic movements. Because in this condition the primary lesion affects the pallidum, a defect of the feed-back control mechanism between basal ganglia and cortex might be the responsible factor.",

     "abstract": "Patient-centeredness is increasingly recognized as a crucial element of quality of care. A suitable instrument to assess the level of patient-centeredness for Parkinson's disease (PD) care is lacking. Here we describe the development and validation of the Patient-Centered Questionnaire for PD (PCQ-PD), and its initial application in a large patient sample.Based on the outcomes of eight focus groups we composed a questionnaire that measures patient-centeredness by assessing patients' care experiences. The questionnaire was sent to 1112 Dutch PD patients, and face-, content- and construct-validity and reliability were assessed. The level of patient-centeredness was determined by calculating scores for overall patient-centeredness [0\u20133], subscale experiences [0\u20133], item experience, item priority and quality improvement.895 PD patients (net response 82.0%) completed the questionnaire. After the validation procedure, the PCQ-PD addressed 46 care aspects in six different subscales of patient-centeredness. The internal consistency of the instrument, expressed in Cronbach's \u03b1 per subscale, ranged from 0.62 to 0.84. The overall patient-centeredness score was 1.69 (SD 0.45). \u2018Emotional support\u2019 (1.05, SD 0.90) and \u2018provision of tailored information\u2019 (1.18, SD 0.57) subscales received the lowest experience ratings. \u2018Access to medical records\u2019 obtained the highest item quality improvement score (5.44).This study produced a valid instrument to measure patient-centeredness in PD care. Psychometric properties of the instrument were good. Application of the PCQ-PD revealed the level of patient-centeredness in the care for PD patients in The Netherlands. The main outcome was a compelling call for the provision of tailored information and emotional support.",

     "abstract": "Postural instability in Parkinson's disease (PD) can lead to falls, injuries and reduced quality of life. We investigated whether balance in PD can improve by offering patients feedback about their own trunk sway as a supplement to natural sensory inputs. Specifically, we investigated the effect of artificial vibrotactile biofeedback on trunk sway in PD.Twenty PD patients were assigned to a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a010) or biofeedback group (n\u00a0=\u00a010). First, all patients performed two sets of six gait tasks and six stance tasks (pre-training assessment). Subsequently, all subjects trained six selected tasks five times (balance training). During this training, the feedback group received vibrotactile feedback of trunk sway, via vibrations delivered at the head. After training, both groups repeated all twelve tasks (post-training assessment). During all tasks, trunk pitch and roll movements were measured with angular velocity sensors attached to the lower trunk. Outcomes included sway angle and sway angular velocity in the roll and pitch plane, and task duration.Overall, patients in the feedback group had a significantly greater reduction in roll (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and pitch (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) sway angular velocity. Moreover, roll sway angle increased more in controls after training, suggesting better training effects in the feedback group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).One session of balance training in PD using a biofeedback system showed beneficial effects on trunk stability. Additional research should examine if these effects increase further after more intensive training, how long these persist after training has stopped, and if the observed effects carry over to non-trained tasks.",

     "abstract": "Freezing of gait is a debilitating and common gait disturbance observed in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). Although the underlying mechanisms of freezing remain unclear, bilateral coordination of steps, measured as a phase coordination index, has been suggested to be related to freezing. Phase coordination index has not, however, been measured during tasks associated with freezing such as turning and backward walking. Understanding how bilateral coordination changes during tasks associated with freezing may improve our understanding of the causes of freezing.Twelve individuals with PD who freeze (freezers), 19 individuals with PD who do not freeze (non-freezers), and 10 healthy, age-matched older adults participated. General motor disease severity and freezing severity were assessed. Phase coordination index was calculated for all subjects during forward walking, backward walking, continuous turning in small radius circles, and turning in large radius circles.Freezers and non-freezers had similar disease duration and general motor severity. Stepping coordination (measured as phase coordination index) was significantly worse in freezers compared to non-freezers and controls. Turning and backward walking, tasks related to freezing, resulted in worse coordination with respect to forward walking. Coordination was associated with severity of freezing scores such that worse coordination was correlated with more severe freezing.These results provide evidence that stepping coordination is related to freezing in people with PD. Identifying variables associated with freezing may provide insights into factors underlying this symptom, and may inform rehabilitative interventions to reduce its occurrence in PD.",

Although the etiology of anxiety in PD is likely to be multifactorial, a dysfunction in the dopaminergic system might be implicated in its pathogenesis. The aim of our study was to investigate a possible dopaminergic mechanism involved in anxiety in newly diagnosed never-medicated PD patients using SPECT and 123I-FP-CIT as the dopamine transporter ligand.Thirty-four newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients with asymmetric motor symptoms were included in the study: 17 patients with right- and 17 with left-motor onset, matched for age, disease duration and motor disability constituted the group. They were all evaluated for anxiety and depression and underwent an SPECT with 123I-FP-CIT. Dopamine transporter (DAT) availability values for right and left caudate and putamen were calculated and compared between patients with and without anxiety. Regression analyses were also performed in order to correlate DAT availability with the severity of the anxiety symptoms.Comparison between PD patients with and those without anxiety revealed significant differences of DAT availability in all the examined regions except the right putamen. In the group of patients considered as a whole, a significant correlation was found between increased anxiety severity and decreased DAT availability in right caudate.We reported an association between nigrostriatal DAT availability deficits and anxiety symptoms in newly diagnosed, untreated PD patients. Our results suggest that hypofunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system may represent one of the functional anomalies involved in anxiety in PD from the earliest stages of disease and irrespective of any therapy.",

The relationship between mutation carrier status and the time to LID onset was explored after matching carriers to non-carriers for age at PD onset, gender, and time from PD diagnosis to levodopa initiation, using Kaplan-Meier curves and the Cox proportional hazards model, using LID onset as an end-point.Overall, 349 Israeli PD patients [222 Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ), 60.5% males, mean age at diagnosis: 60.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.2 years] participated in the study.

Of 11 studies reporting Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III scores, 10 found improvements that met the CID of 10.8 points.

For controls, utilization of all forms of healthcare increased with age; for PD cases the relationship was weak, except for specialist visits, where an inverse relationship was observed. A rural region of residence was associated with a lower rate of seeing a specialist or any medical doctor, with a higher rate of hospitalization than for urban cases or controls. Comorbidity was strongly associated with healthcare use for both groups. Over the six-year study period significant differences in the trend were observed for mental disorder hospitalizations, hospital days, and physician visits.Factors associated with healthcare utilization in PD patients differ from those without PD.

Neuropsychological assessment showed a gradation in cognitive performance from controls to PDND (significantly worse on visuospatial performance) and then to PDD (more impaired on memory, naming, fluency and visuospatial functions). No CSF-VBM correlations were found in controls or PDND patients. In contrast, in the analysis of both the PDD subgroup and the entire PD (PDND\u00a0+\u00a0PDD) sample, we found significant negative CSF-GMV correlations for \u03c4 and phospho-\u03c4 and significant positive CSF-GMV correlations for A\u03b2 in mostly frontal and temporal structures.

However, considerable heterogeneity of LRRK2-PD suggests the existence of additional genetic and/or environmental modifiers for LRRK2 carriers, which have yet to be confirmed by large-scale human studies. In a Chinese cohort consisting of 2013 sporadic PD patients and 1971 controls, we investigated the modification of the two Asian-specific LRRK2 variants, G2385R and R1628P, by variants of five other PD-associated genes/loci (SNCA, MAPT, GBA, BST1, PARK16). Of all the PD patients, 13.1% carried LRRK2 G2385R and/or R1628P variant. Among these carriers, a total of 15 different polygenic genotypes were detected representing different combination patterns between LRRK2 variants and those of the other genes/loci, which, alone\u00a0or in combination, significantly modified the LRRK2-related risk for PD and the patients\u2019 ages at onset (AAOs). These results not only represent the largest replication data affirming the association between PD and all the six genes/loci in Chinese, but for the first time suggest that multiple PD-associated genetic factors modify both the penetrance and AAO of LRRK2 parkinsonism. This finding may have important implications for elucidating pathophysiologic mechanisms relevant to both LRRK2-associated and idiopathic PD. However, testing interactions among multiple genes by genetic association studies is still challenging. Future studies with much larger sample sizes are needed to confirm our findings.",

Olfaction was categorised into two groups at the cut-off of the median level of UPSIT scores. Data was analysed to study the relationship of olfaction on weight change.Thirty-nine were weight losers (WL) and 60 non-weight losers (NWL). WL were significantly older (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), females (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and had more severe impairment of olfaction, UPSIT 15\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 vs 19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05; p\u00a0<\u00a00.004.

There was no difference in the proportion of smokers, medication usage, difficult swallowing or calorie consumption in any group. Weight losers and severe olfaction loss were associated with more severe H&Y stage. Patients below the median-UPSIT (anosmic) had lost weight during the previous years whereas those above the median (hyposmic) had gained weight. Regression analysis revealed UPSIT at the median level to be the most significant variable (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for weight loss.

Leg extensor muscle strength and muscle power were measured using pneumatic variable resistance equipment. Lower limb bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor were measured using the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.

Patients with more severe disease may benefit from robot-assisted gait training performed by the Gait-Trainer GT1, as a harness supports them with their feet placed on motor-driven footplates. The aim of this study was to determine whether robot-assisted gait training could have a positive influence on postural stability in patients with PD at Hoehn & Yahr stage 3\u20134.Thirty-four patients with PD at Hoehn & Yahr stage 3\u20134 were randomly assigned into two groups.

The Robotic Training group (n\u00a0=\u00a017) underwent robot-assisted gait training, while the Physical Therapy group (n\u00a0=\u00a017) underwent a training program not specifically aimed at improving postural stability. Patients were evaluated before, immediately after and 1-month post-treatment. Primary outcomes were: Berg Balance scale; Nutt's rating.A significant improvement was found after treatment on the Berg Balance Scale and the Nutt's rating in favor of the Robotic Training group (Berg: 43.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.73; Nutt: 1.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.50) compared to the Physical Therapy group (Berg: 37.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.68; Nutt: 2.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.59).

Depressed individuals were selected from a representative sample of 33 PD patients using scores from the 15 question Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Magnetic Resonance Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) tractography was used to examine the structural integrity of the uncinate fasciculus (UF), a white matter tract that projects from the hippocampus, amygdala and temporal pole to the orbitofrontal cortex, and the corpus callosum. Integrity of the UF and corpus callosum was established through measures of mean diffusivity (MD), fractional anisotropy (FA) and tract length. A volumetric analysis of the hippocampal head, body and tail, as well as the amygdala was performed to determine whether volume differences in these structures in PD relate to depression.The depressed PD group showed smaller amygdala volumes compared to healthy controls, but the groups did not differ on any other measure.The present study found intact limbic connectivity but suggests that amygdala atrophy may be present in Parkinson's disease with depression.

     "abstract": "Alien limb phenomenon (ALP) has been rarely reported as a presenting feature of Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD), though neurologists may not recognize it as a prompt to search for CJD.This report demonstrates the clinical features of patients with ALP and CJD.All patients with the ALP between 1/1/1996\u00a0\u2013\u00a07/28/2011 were identified by the Mayo Clinic Medical Record Linkage system and cross-referenced with a diagnosis of CJD in that same time span. This yielded 13 patients, including six women.The median age at onset of CJD symptoms was 69 years. Two patients were classified as possible CJD, five as probable CJD, and six as definite CJD based on research diagnostic criteria for CJD. The median time to onset of ALP symptoms was 0.5 weeks. The ALP afflicted the left side in nine patients. The median time to death from CJD symptom onset was 10.5 weeks. In four patients ALP was the initial and sole neurologic sign. In four others it was the initial manifestation coexisting with other deficits. ALP related symptoms initially prompted three other patients to seek medical evaluation. ALP was either initially or eventually accompanied by ipsilateral hemineglect, ideomotor apraxia and/or cortical sensory loss in nine patients. Imaging of the contralateral parietal lobe demonstrated cortical T2 hyperintensity and/or restricted diffusion in all eight patients who had abnormal MRI neuroimaging.ALP should trigger suspicion of CJD. The neuroanatomic correlate of ALP in CJD appears to be the contralateral parietal lobe.",

     "abstract": "A large proportion of patients with Parkinson's disease develop dysphagia during the course of the disease. Dysphagia in Parkinson's disease affects different phases of deglutition, has a strong impact on quality of life and may cause severe complications, i.e. aspirational pneumonia. So far, little is known on how deep-brain-stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus influences deglutition in PD.Videofluoroscopic swallowing studies on 18 patients with Parkinson's disease, which had been performed preoperatively, and postoperatively with deep-brain-stimulation-on and deep-brain-stimulation-off, were analyzed retrospectively. The patients were examined in each condition with three consistencies (viscous, fluid and solid). The \u2018New Zealand Index for Multidisciplinary Evaluation of Swallowing (NZIMES) Subscale One\u2019 for qualitative and \u2018Logemann-MBS-Parameters\u2019 for quantitative evaluation were assessed.Preoperatively, none of the patients presented with clinically relevant signs of dysphagia. While postoperatively, the mean daily levodopa equivalent dosage was reduced by 50% and deep-brain-stimulation led to a 50% improvement in motor symptoms measured by the UPDRS III, no clinically relevant influence of deep-brain-stimulation-on swallowing was observed using qualitative parameters (NZIMES). However quantitative parameters (Logemann scale) found significant changes of pharyngeal parameters with deep-brain-stimulation-on as compared to preoperative condition and deep-brain-stimulation-off mostly with fluid consistency.In Parkinson patients without dysphagia deep-brain-stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus modulates the pharyngeal deglutition phase but has no clinically relevant influence on deglutition. Further studies are needed to test if deep-brain-stimulation is a therapeutic option for patients with swallowing disorders.",

     "abstract": "Cognitive and olfactory impairments have been demonstrated in patients with Machado\u2013Joseph disease (MJD), and a possible relationship with dopaminergic dysfunction is implicated. However, there is still controversy regarding the pattern of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in patients with MJD. In this study, we investigated whether these patients had different Dopamine Transporter (DAT) densities as compared to healthy subjects, and correlated these data with cognitive performance and sense of smell. Twenty-two MJD patients and 20 control subjects were enrolled. The neuropsychological assessment comprised the Spatial Span, Symbol Search, Picture Completion, Stroop Color Word Test, Trail Making Test and Phonemic Verbal Fluency test. The 16-item Sniffin' Sticks was used to evaluate odor identification. DAT imaging was performed using the SPECT radioligand [99mTc]-TRODAT-1, alongside with Magnetic Resonance imaging. Patients with MJD showed significantly lower DAT density in the caudate (1.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27 versus 2.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.50, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), posterior putamen (0.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32 versus 1.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and anterior putamen (1.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.31 versus 1.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared with healthy controls. The putamen/caudate ratio was also significantly lower in patients compared with controls (0.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.038 versus 0.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.032, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027). Even though we had only two patients with parkinsonism, we detected striatal dopaminergic deficits in those patients. No significant correlations were detected between DAT density and cognitive performance or Sniffin' Sticks scores. The data suggests that striatal dopamine deficit is not involved in cognitive or sense of smell deficits. This finding raises the possibility of extra-striatal dopamine and other neurotransmitter system involvement or of cerebellum neurodegeneration exerting a direct influence on cognitive and sensorial information processing in MJD.",

Furthermore, the QMAS scores at T0 significantly correlated with in-person rated TETRAS scores as well as with subsequent time-intervals instrumental scores. No significant differences were detected between time-intervals QMAS average measurements using ANOVA. There was a maximal 23% absolute variation in tremor amplitude from baseline as determined by the QMAS. Test for equality of variance showed high measurement variability for subjects with high QMAS scores at T0 and throughout the 6\u00a0h of assessment.Baseline measures are predictive of tremor amplitude at subsequent assessments during the day.

     "abstract": "The Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics Battery-4 for PD offers the promise of a computerized approach to cognitive assessment.To assess its utility, the ANAM4-PD was administered to 72 PD patients and 24 controls along with a traditional battery. Reliability was assessed by retesting 26 patients.The Cognitive Efficiency Score (CES; a global score) exhibited high reliability (r\u00a0=\u00a00.86). Constituent variables exhibited lower reliability. The CES correlated strongly with the traditional battery global score, but displayed weaker relationships to UPDRS scores than the traditional score. Multivariate analysis of variance revealed a significant difference between the patient and control groups in ANAM4-PD performance, with three ANAM4-PD tests, Math, Tower, and Pursuit Tracking, displaying sizeable differences. In discriminant analyses these variables were as effective as the total ANAM4-PD in classifying cases designated as impaired based on traditional variables. Principal components analyses uncovered fewer factors in the ANAM4-PD relative to the traditional battery. ANAM4-PD variables correlated at higher levels with traditional motor and processing speed variables than with untimed executive, intellectual or memory variables.The ANAM4-PD displays high global reliability, but variable subtest reliability. The battery assesses a narrower range of cognitive functions than traditional tests, and discriminates between patients and controls less effectively. Three ANAM4-PD tests, Pursuit Tracking, Math, and Tower performed as well as the total ANAM4-PD in classifying patients as cognitively impaired. These findings could guide the refinement of the ANAM4-PD as an efficient method of screening for mild to moderate cognitive deficits in PD patients.",

Here we investigated facial emotion recognition impairment in PSP with respect to Parkinson's disease (PD), with the primary aim of outlining the differences between the two disorders. Moreover, we applied an intensity-dependent paradigm to examine the different threshold of encoding emotional faces in PSP and PD.The Penn Emotion Recognition Test (PERT) was used to assess facial emotion recognition ability in PSP and PD patients. The 2 groups were matched for age, disease duration, global cognition, depression, anxiety, and daily L-Dopa intake.PSP patients displayed significantly lower recognition of sad and happy emotional faces with respect to PD ones. This applied to global recognition, as well as to low-intensity and high-intensity facial emotion recognition.These results indicate specific impairment of recognition of sad and happy facial emotions in PSP with respect to PD patients. The differences may depend upon diverse involvement of cortical\u2013subcortical loops integrating emotional states and cognition between the two conditions, and might represent a neuropsychological correlate of the apathetic syndrome frequently encountered in PSP.",

There is some consensus, however, about the involvement of the cerebellum and accumulating evidence points towards a dysfunction of the gabaergic system. We hypothesize that the serotonin neurotransmission system may also play a role as it does in tremor in Parkinson disease. This study aimed to investigate the association between the severity of tremor symptoms and the gabaergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission systems in essential tremor.We measured the tremor clinical rating scale score and acquired DASB and Flumazenil PET scans in 10 patients who presented with essential tremor at different stages of clinical severity. Statistically significant correlations were sought between the scale scores and parametric binding potential images.The correlation analysis of cerebellar Flumazenil uptake and tremor clinical rating scale scores reached statistical significance (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.423, p\u00a0=\u00a00.041), whereas no association was detected in the DASB scans.The severity of tremor correlated with the abnormalities found in GABA receptor binding, suggesting a primary gabaergic deficiency or a functional abnormality at the level of GABAA receptor subtypes.

Tetrabenazine is approved to treat chorea in Huntington disease, but its effect on posturography scores, and balance in general, is unknown.We designed a study to test computerized dynamic posturography performance while taking tetrabenazine and after stopping tetrabenazine for at least three days.10 Huntington disease patients were studied both ON and OFF tetrabenazine. The composite score was statistically different between ON and OFF conditions and both conditions were significantly worse than reference scores. There was no significant difference between ON and OFF trials in the number of falls. A significant improvement on Sensory Orientation Test conditions 3 (sway-referenced vision) and 5 (sway-referenced motion of the support surface and eyes closed) was seen while ON tetrabenazine. Strategy scores 1\u20133 were also significantly different while ON tetrabenazine.These findings suggest that tetrabenazine aided patients in gating out of abnormal visual cues when other sensory modalities were available, as well as in gating out abnormal kinesthetic cues when visual cues were not available. It could not help with gating out of simultaneous abnormal visual and somatosensory cues. Thus, tetrabenazine can improve postural stability when one sensory modality is irrelevant, but this effect is not sustained when multiple abnormal sensory modalities are present. This is the first study supporting the use of any medicine to treat balance problems in Huntington disease.",

     "abstract": "Essential Tremor (ET) and Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) are both highly heritable neurological disorders. The frequent occurrence of multi-incident families suggests the existence of highly penetrant alleles. However, linkage analyses and positional cloning approaches performed within the last 10 years essentially failed to identify responsible mutations. Several loci were found, but their relevance was questioned given the occurrence of suspected phenocopies in many of those families. Remarkably, in some ET and RLS families with an apparent autosomal dominant mode of transmission, the proportion of affected individuals was higher than the expected 50% and therefore suggests a non-mendelian inheritance in some cases. In fact, there is increasing evidence that epigenetic modifications, which refer to changes in gene expression without changes in DNA sequence, can be transmitted to the next generation. Moreover, epigenetic information can be transferred from one allele of a gene to the other allele of the same gene; if then inherited to the next generation, the offspring consequently presents phenotypic properties related to the untransmitted allele. This phenomenon known as paramutation is well documented in plants and has recently been shown to occur also in mammals. Here, I explore the possibility that it is the epigenetic and not only the genetic state which confers disease risk in families. Inheritance of epigenetic mutations along with paramutational events have the potential to explain the non-mendelian features in the genetics of both diseases.",

Further, we suggested this generic cell state (not restricted to neurons) could be epigenetically locked-in. This raises the theoretical possibility of reverting a cell\u2019s PD-state to normality by appropriate epigenetic reprogramming. In here, we propose an in\u00a0vitro relatively high throughput search for a cocktail of molecules that induces an epigenetic reversal of the PD-state. A generic multi-tissue PD-state phenotype appears to be a defect on mitochondrial bioenergetics. In the above search, we suggest utilizing a metabolic challenge as a preliminary screen for assessing, via improvement of energy metabolism, reversal of the PD-state.",

There were genetic associations between four variants (G2019S, G2385R, R1628P and A419V) and increased PD risk, while there was no evidence of statistically significant association between P755L and PD. Publication bias and heterogeneity were absent in most analyses.

The two sons developed dystonia-parkinsonism in adolescence after consuming large amounts of alcohol. All 3 of those with psychiatric interviews reached diagnosable thresholds for mood disorder (bipolar or dysthymia) and some form of anxiety disorder.The phenotype and age of onset is broader than previously reported in RDP, suggesting that it could be under-reported. Prior to this study, neuropsychologic symptoms associated with RDP were under-appreciated. Those patients who are at risk or suspected of having RDP should be cautioned to avoid excessive alcohol intake. Further study is needed to assess if the cognitive and psychiatric features are part of a broader RDP phenotype and this may have implications for future research into genetic susceptibility for psychiatric disease.",

     "abstract": "Visual processing extends from the retinal level to the ventral temporal lobe, and is modified by top-down and bottom-up processing. Complex visual hallucinations (VH) are commonly a feature of disorders which affect temporal lobe structures, frequently in association with impairment of ascending monoaminergic pathways. When Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with VH, pathological changes characteristically affect the temporal lobes, a finding which is recapitulated by imaging findings. However, a major association of VH is with cognitive decline, and this is typically linked to deficits in attention and working memory, both of which are modulated by dopamine. Similarly, dopamine plays a crucial role in the function of prefrontal cortex, in addition to controlling access to consciousness via gating mechanisms that are dependent on the basal ganglia.",

Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the reliability/validity of the Dynamic Parkinson Gait Scale (DYPAGS) composed of eight relevant items for the objective quantification of PD gait features: walking forwards/backwards/with dual-task, turning to both sides, imaginary obstacle avoidance with both legs and passing through narrow spaces. The scale was validated on thirty-five patients with mild to severe parkinsonism in their habitual \u201con-state\u201d. A shorter 6 item-version was designed on the basis of a principal component analysis. No significant floor/ceiling effect was detected. The internal consistency was excellent. The levels of interrater agreement, precision and minimal detectable change were adequate. The criterion-related validity was demonstrated by strong correlations with the DYPAGS scores and those at the gait subscales of the Tinetti Mobility Test and MDS-UPDRS. The construct validity was assessed by moderate-strong correlations with the Freezing of Gait Questionnaire, mobility index of the PD Questionnaire (PDQ-39), disease duration and levodopa equivalent daily doses. Statistical analyses using the coefficient of determination showed that both DYPGAS versions were superior to the other instruments to identify patients with gait disturbances with poorer response to dopaminergic treatment. Full and short DYPAGS are reliable instruments for the quantification of \u201con\u201d PD-related episodic gait disturbances. The full version is sensitive to detect subtle disturbances in mild parkinsonism. The shorter one is easily administered and reliably quantifies gait disturbances in moderate to severe parkinsonism. We recommend their use for research and clinical practice.",

Five cases had subacute clinical worsening and two sudden deterioration. All of them had an impedance increment (>4000\u00a0\u03a9) with the active contacts. Further reprogramming was attempted in all the cases using the undamaged contacts. However, five patients had incomplete clinical control and were reoperated with an electrode replacement.

Aim of the present study was to explore cortical and subcortical metabolic modulations measured by Positron Emission Tomography associated with improved motor manifestations after deep brain stimulation in Parkinson disease, comparing the ON and OFF conditions.Investigations were performed in the stimulator off- and on-conditions in 14 parkinsonian patients and results were compared with a group of matched healthy controls. The results were also used to correlate metabolic changes with the clinical effectiveness of the procedure.The comparisons using Statistical parametric mapping revealed a brain metabolic pattern typical of advanced Parkinson disease. The direct comparison in ON vs OFF condition showed mainly an increased metabolism in subthalamic regions, corresponding to the deep brain stimulation site. A positive correlation exists between neurostimulation clinical effectiveness and metabolic differences in ON and OFF state, including the primary sensorimotor, premotor and parietal cortices, anterior cingulate cortex.Deep brain stimulation seems to operate modulating the neuronal network rather than merely exciting or inhibiting basal ganglia nuclei. Correlations with Parkinson Disease cardinal features suggest that the improvement of specific motor signs associated with deep brain stimulation might be explained by the functional modulation, not only in the target region, but also in surrounding and remote connecting areas, resulting in clinically beneficial effects.",

Onset of motor symptoms was asymmetric in 93 (59%) and symmetric in 65 patients (41%). Symmetric motor onset was associated with greater disease severity. Chronic levodopa response was positive in 75 (47.8%) and negative in 82 patients (52.2%). A negative response to levodopa was associated with greater frequency of symmetric onset of motor symptoms, worst disease severity, absence of dyskinesia and greater number of vascular risk factors. Frontal lobe showed largest vascular load. Striatal DAT was normal in 48 (30.4%) and abnormal in 110 (69.6%) patients. Patients with normal DAT binding showed higher vascular load at MRI. Significant predictive factors of worst disease severity and negative response to levodopa were hypertension, vascular lesions in basal ganglia/periventricular regions, and normal DAT uptake.Multiple cerebral vascular lesions modify clinical presentation and severity in patients with parkinsonism and this is underlined by specific risk factors primarily hypertension.

In one patient, we also performed transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) using single and paired pulses.In all patients, the EMG features revealed movement activated quasi-rhythmic repetitive jerks; the JLBA and EEG-EMG spectral and coherence profiles indicated a cortical generator of the myoclonus. All patients had enhanced LLRs during muscle contraction, while none showed giant SSEPs. The evaluation of intracortical inhibition by means of TMS revealed reduced inhibition at short and long interstimulus intervals.The rhythmic course of the action myoclonus and the characteristics of the LLRs suggest that myoclonus is due to a reverberant circuit involving the motor cortex, possibly because of an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory cortical neuronal systems.Our findings suggest a similar cortical dysfunction in childhood and juvenile onset HD, which probably results from a specific circuitry impairment.",

The definition of gastroparesis varies; currently the most widely accepted definition (from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium) is the presence of appropriate symptoms (including nausea, retching, vomiting, stomach fullness, and inability to finish a meal) for \u226512 weeks, together with delayed gastric emptying on scintigraphy and the absence of any obstructive lesions on upper GI endoscopy. In PD patients, gastroparesis has the potential to affect nutrition and quality of life, as well as the absorption of PD medications, including L-dopa. This reduced absorption of L-dopa has implications for the control of the PD motor symptoms for which it is administered. We performed a systematic review of the literature on gastroparesis in PD with the aim of developing an evidence-based approach to its management. Based on this review, we conclude that while gastric emptying has been reported to be frequently delayed in PD, the existing data do not permit definitive conclusions concerning its true prevalence, relationship to the underlying disease process, relevance to PD management, or the optimal therapy of related GI symptoms.

The recommended starting dose in patients with blepharospasm is 2.5\u20135.0 U/injection site. Patients can be switched using a 1:1 conversion ratio from Botox\u00ae (onabotulinumtoxinA, Allergen Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) to Xeomin without any loss of efficacy or safety concerns. Xeomin does not differ from Botox in terms of its potency, onset, diffusion profile, or duration and waning of effect.

     "abstract": "Albert Schweitzer (1875\u20131965) the world-famous philosopher, theologian, concert organist, musicologist, philanthropist and winner of the 1952 Nobel Peace Prize suffered throughout most of his life from severe and painful muscle cramps in his right upper extremity which were triggered exclusively by handwriting. They led to tonic finger flexion and wrist extension and produced slow and clumsy handwriting of a reduced character size. Other motor functions including Schweitzer\u2019s highly skilful and famous organ playing were not affected. Inheritance from his mother is likely. Schweitzer applied several coping strategies including a specific holding pattern for pens, usage of special pens, avoidance of handwriting and slowing of handwriting. With all these features Schweitzer presents as a classical case of action-specific dystonia in the form of a simple tonic writer\u2019s cramp.Interestingly, Schweitzer never received a medical diagnosis, although writer\u2019s cramp had already been identified and described as a medical condition. Impairment of his handwriting but not his organ playing may give insight into the multifactorial aetiology of writer\u2019s cramp.",

Of these 20 patients, 15 (75%) developed chorea gravidarum. Generalized chorea was found in 67% of these 15 patients, focal or multifocal chorea was identified in 20% and 13.4% developed hemichorea. In 80% of cases chorea began in the first 6 months of gestation. Three women with previous persistent chorea experienced worsening of the movement disorder during pregnancy. Remission occurred after delivery in 11 patients whereas the other four remained with non-disabling chorea during the first 12 months after delivery. Abortion occurred in two patients (13%). All patients with chorea gravidarum subsequently treated with oral contraceptives developed recurrence of chorea.Chorea gravidarum is a frequent complication of pregnancy in patients with previous history of Sydenham\u2019s Chorea and an increased risk of miscarriage should be considered. Our findings confirm the notion that chorea gravidarum results from hormonal changes acting on previously dysfunctional basal ganglia.",

     "abstract": "Difficulty switching between motor programs is a proposed cause of motor blocks in Parkinson disease (PD). Switching from one movement to another has been studied in the upper extremity and during postural control tasks, but not yet in the eyes and lower limb in PD. The purpose of this study was to compare movement orientation switching ability between people with PD and age-matched controls (CON) and to determine if switching ability is correlated between the eyes and lower limb. Twenty-six persons with PD and 19 age-matched controls participated. Movement orientation switching was studied in a seated position with the head fixed in a chinrest. In response to a randomly generated tone, participants switched from a continuous back-and-forth movement in either the horizontal or vertical orientation to the opposite orientation as quickly as possible. Lower limb movements were performed with the great toe pointing back and forth between targets positioned on a 45\u00b0 angled floor platform. Eye movements were back and forth between the same targets. Eye and lower limb switch time was reduced in PD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but after normalizing switch time to movement velocity, no differences existed between PD and CON. Eye and lower limb switch times were correlated in PD (r\u00a0=\u00a00.513, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but not in CON. In PD, switch time and movement velocity of the lower limb, but not the eyes, correlated with bradykinesia and postural instability/gait. Our results suggest that individuals with PD experience movement-switching deficits with both the eyes and lower limb, perhaps driven by overall bradykinesia.",

In this study, we tested the protective and rescue action of NIr treatment in a chronic MPTP model, developed to resemble more closely the slow progressive degeneration in PD patients. We examined three regions of dopaminergic cells, the SNc, periaqueductal grey matter (PaG) and zona incerta-hypothalamus (ZI-Hyp). BALB/c mice had MPTP or saline injections over five weeks, followed by a three-week survival. NIr treatment was applied either at the same time as (simultaneous series) or after (post-treatment series) the MPTP insult. There were four groups within each series; Saline, Saline-NIr, MPTP and MPTP-NIr. Brains were processed for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunochemistry and cell number was analysed using the optical fractionator method. In the SNc, there was a significant reduction (\u223c45%) in TH+ cell number in the MPTP groups compared to the saline controls of both series. In the MPTP-NIr groups of both series, TH+ cell number was significantly higher (\u223c25%) than in the MPTP groups, but lower than in the saline controls (\u223c20%). By contrast in the PaG and ZI-Hyp, there were no significant differences in TH+ cell number between the MPTP an MPTP-NIr groups of either series. In summary, exposure to NIr either at the same time or well after chronic MPTP insult saved many SNc dopaminergic cells from degeneration.",

However, to date no well-validated carer specific quality of life measure has been developed for carers of people with PD.This paper documents the development and validation of a PD specific carer quality of life scale.In depth interviews were undertaken with carers of people with PD. The interviews were transcribed and analysed thematically to derive a pool of potential items for the questionnaire. A pilot survey was used to refine the initial version of the questionnaire. A developmental survey was undertaken and the results analysed to produce the final 29-item measure. A validation survey was then undertaken to assess the construct validity and reliability of the measure.Survey results suggest a 29-item questionnaire tapping four dimensions of quality of life (Social and Personal Activities, Anxiety and Depression, Self care, and Strain). Internal consistency reliability was found to be high for all domains. Data completeness was high. Construct validity (assessed by correlations with a generic measure of quality of life) confirmed prior hypotheses.The 29-item Parkinson Disease Questionnaire for Carers (PDQ-Carer) is a short, meaningful quality of life instrument, which taps areas of specific salience and concern to PD carers.",

Adjunctive levodopa was allowed. Primary outcomes included adverse events (AEs) and extent of rotigotine exposure. Other outcomes included time to levodopa, incidence of dyskinesias, and efficacy using the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II\u00a0+\u00a0III total score.Of 217 patients entering the open-label study, 47% were still in the study upon closure; 24% withdrew because of AEs and 6% because of lack of efficacy. The median exposure to rotigotine was 1910 days (\u223c5 years, 3 months; range 1\u20132188 days). Most common AEs were somnolence (23% per patient-year), falls (17%), peripheral edema (14%), nausea (12%), and application site reactions (ASRs; 12%). 3% withdrew because of ASRs. 26% patients did not initiate levodopa; of those who did, fewer than half started levodopa in the first year. Dyskinesias were reported by 25% patients; the majority (83%) reported their first episode after initiating levodopa. Mean UPDRS II\u00a0+\u00a0III total scores remained below double-blind baseline for up to 2 years of open-label treatment.This is the longest interventional study of rotigotine conducted to date. Transdermal rotigotine was generally well tolerated for up to 6 years; AEs reported were similar to those observed in shorter studies and led to discontinuation in only 24% patients.",

The purpose of the present study is to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of studies on the diagnostic performance of 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy for the differential diagnosis of PD and other neurodegenerative parkinsonism, specifically multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration.A computer literature search of the PubMED/MEDLINE database was conducted to find relevant published articles on 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy for the differential diagnosis of PD and other neurodegenerative parkinsonism. We used the bivariate random-effects model to obtain the pooled estimates of the sensitivity and specificity and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals.Thirteen studies comprising 845 patients including 625 PD and 220 other neurodegenerative parkinsonism were analyzed. The pooled sensitivity and specificity to differentiate PD from other neurodegenerative parkinsonism by the early heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratio were 82.6% and 89.2%, respectively, and those by the delayed H/M ratio were 89.7% and 82.6%, respectively. When PD was limited to early stage (Hoehn-Yahr stage 1 or 2), the pooled sensitivity and specificity by the delayed H/M ratio were 94.1% and 80.2%, respectively.The present meta-analysis confirmed high sensitivity and specificity of 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy for differentiating PD from other neurodegenerative parkinsonism in both early and delayed imaging phases. Furthermore, 123I-MIBG myocardial scintigraphy was highly effective for distinguishing early PD.",

Only data from the 17 patients who completed the Parkinson Fatigue Scale (PFS) and Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) before and approximately 6 months after surgery were analyzed. Other evaluations included the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS).When the cohort was analyzed as a whole, there was no significant change in the mean or binary PFS score from baseline to the 6 month evaluation. However, the fatigue response of individual subjects was variable. Six of 12 subjects with fatigue before surgery were not fatigued post-operatively, while 3/5 subjects without fatigue before surgery became fatigued after DBS surgery. Fatigue in 8 subjects remained unchanged. Change in fatigue scores correlated significantly with change in the motor UPDRS, GDS and AES. Improvement in PFS also correlated with a higher PFS baseline score and higher baseline UPDRS motor off score.Changes in fatigue severity were not observed in our cohort as a whole, but there were changes in fatigue on an individual level. These changes appear to be related to the effects of STN DBS on motor improvement and mood.",

At T\u00a0=\u00a04\u20136\u00a0h, Positive Affect rebounded below baseline in dyskinetics only. On regression analysis, rebound worsening positively correlated with ratings of dyskinesia severity. Negative Affect improved with L-dopa in all groups and tended to remain below baseline for 6\u00a0h after L-dopa challenge. Peak effects of L-dopa on Positive Affect and Negative Affect occurred significantly earlier than effects on Purdue Pegboard test and were positively correlated with L-dopa equivalent daily dose.There is a clinical dissociation between L-dopa effects on motor function, Positive Affect and Negative Affect. Rebound worsening in Positive Affect occurred only in dyskinetic patients and the onset of rebound worsening occurred before the end of the motor benefit phase.

We investigate the role of PARK2 polymorphisms on PD risk and their interactions with mitochondrial haplogroups/clusters as well as with TFAM variability.104 early-onset PD patients (EOPD, age at onset \u226450 years) were screened for PARK2 coding sequence changes including gene dosage alterations. Three selected PARK2 polymorphisms (S167N, V380L, D394N) were genotyped in 326 PD patients and 315 controls using TaqMan allelic discrimination assay.PARK2 screen revealed two heterozygous changes in two EOPD patients: exon 2 deletion and one novel synonymous variation (c.999C\u00a0>\u00a0A, P333P).In association study no differences in genotype/allele frequencies of S167N, V380L, D394N were found between analyzed groups.

Cronbach's \u03b1, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and the smallest detectable change (SDC) were calculated. Bland and Altman analysis was performed. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to explore structural validity. Floor and ceiling effects were investigated.Cronbach's \u03b1 for the MFI-total and subscales ranged from 0.74 (reduced motivation (RM)) to 0.92 (MFI-total). ICC's ranged from 0.65 (mental fatigue (MF) to 0.81 (physical fatigue (PF)), SDC ranged from 4 points (PF and RM) to 15 points (MFI-total). Bland and Altman analysis showed no systematic differences between assessments. A floor effect was found for MF and ceiling effects for PF and reduced activity (RA). A four-factor model was extracted, combining general fatigue (GF) and PF as one factor.The MFI is reliable and valid to assess fatigue in patients with PD. Clinicians and researchers interested in assessing specific aspects of fatigue should consider interpreting GF and PF as one subscale measuring physical aspects of fatigue. To establish whether the MFI can detect meaningful changes, studies on anchor-based responsiveness and the minimal important change are needed in PD.",

The tasks included gait initiation, stepping over an obstacle and gait termination using an event-related design. Subjects watched a video clip showing an actor walking and imagined the walking process.At gait initiation, no significant difference could be found between PD and the Old controls. Activation in the visual related areas in the Old subjects was increased compared to the Young subjects. While imagining stepping over obstacles, the right dorsal premotor area (PMd), precentral, right inferior parietal lobule, and bilateral precuneus were more activated in PD compared to the Old. An extensive network of bilateral SMA, PMd, posterior parietal lobe and visual association areas was activated in the Old versus the Young subjects. At gait termination, visual related areas were noted when PD was compared to the Old. In contrast, increased activation in bilateral pre-SMA, PMd, ventral premotor area, precentral, posterior parietal lobes and visual association areas were activated in the Old when compared to the Young.Our study provides image based evidence for gait disturbance in PD patients and during normal aging. The compensatory cortical mechanism in the findings could be a background resource for further therapeutic interventions.",

Gait asymmetry and reduced coordination of gait have also been implicated in freezing of gait. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of controlling for step length on asymmetry and coordination of gait. A\u00a0second aim was to determine if asymmetry and bilateral coordination predicted freezing.Data for sixteen participants with PD and freezing of gait, ten people with PD but no history of freezing and ten controls was analyzed. Participants, in their \u2018off\u2019 state, had their gait recorded walking at preferred and normalized step lengths of 100%, 75%, 50% and 25%.Asymmetry of swing time increased in all groups as step length decreased from 100% to 25% and did not differ between the PD group with freezing compared to the PD group without freezing in the preferred and normalized step length conditions after adjusting for step length and disease severity. Coordination of walking worsened in all groups at the shorter normalized step lengths with no difference between PD groups in the 25% condition where the frequency of freezing was highest. Asymmetry and coordination of gait were not predictive of freezing in the 25% condition.These results suggest asymmetry and decreased coordination of gait are affected by step length and may not be factors in determining freezing of gait in PD.",

We undertook a pilot, open-label study of a group-based singing intervention, consisting of twelve 90-min weekly sessions led by a voice and speech therapist/singing instructor. The primary outcome measure of vocal loudness as measured by sound pressure level (SPL) at 50\u00a0cm during connected speech was not significantly different one week after the intervention or at 13 weeks after the intervention. A number of secondary measures reflecting pitch range, phonation time and maximum loudness also were unchanged.

Included were 229 cases within 6 years of onset of PD as defined according to the UK PD Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria. Controls were 357 inpatients and outpatients without neurodegenerative disease. Adjustment was made for sex, age, region of residence, and smoking. Based on the recessive model, compared with subjects with the CC or CT genotype of SNP rs356220, those with the TT genotype had a significantly increased risk of sporadic PD: the adjusted OR was 1.42 (95% CI: 1.002\u20132.02). In the additive model, SNP rs2736990 was significantly related to the risk of sporadic PD: the adjusted OR was 1.30 (95% CI: 1.002\u20131.68).

Characteristic features include: early onset symptoms with slow clinical course, good response to low doses of levodopa, and frequently treatment-induced dyskinesia. Studies using a voxel-based morphometry approach showed a decrease in the gray matter volume of the basal ganglia in mutation carriers during the symptomatic stages.

Patients but not controls also underwent a neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessment.Results revealed a reduction of bilateral caudate nuclei volumes in YOPD-p patients compared to the YOPD patients while there were no statistically significant differences between other groups. YOPD-p patients showed similar results to other patient groups on neuropsychiatric and neuropsychological evaluation measures.YOPD-p and YOPD patients showed a different pattern of volume changes in basal ganglia. Despite its relatively benign clinical course, carrying the Parkin mutation seems to be associated with greater atrophy in subcortical structures. Failure of compensatory mechanisms, different mutation types and pathophysiologic processes may underlie this diverse pattern of subcortical brain changes.",

We studied thirty-nine Zambian patients, thirty-eight with PD and one with parkinsonian-pyramidal syndrome (18% familial; average onset age 54.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.2 years). In the whole group, all SNCA exons and LRRK2 exons 29 to 48 (encoding for important functional domains) were sequenced. In the familial patients and those with onset <55 years (n\u00a0=\u00a022) the whole LRRK2 coding region was sequenced (51 exons). In the patients with onset <50 years (n\u00a0=\u00a012), all parkin, PINK1, and DJ-1 exons were sequenced, and dosage analysis of parkin, PINK1, DJ-1, LRRK2, and SNCA was performed. Dosage analysis was also performed in the majority of the late-onset patients.The LRRK2 p.Gly2019Ser mutation was not detected. A novel LRRK2 missense variant (p.Ala1464Gly) of possible pathogenic role was found in one case. Two heterozygous, likely disease-causing deletions of parkin (exon 2 and exon 4) were detected in an early-onset case. Pathogenic mutations were not detected in SNCA, PINK1, or DJ-1. We also report variability at several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the above-mentioned genes.This is the first molecular genetic study in Zambian PD patients, and the first comprehensive analysis of the LRRK2 and SNCA genes in a Sub-Saharan population. Common disease-causing mutations were not detected, suggesting that further investigations in PD patients from these populations might unravel the role of additional, still unknown genes.",

The current 'gold standard' of assessing the severity of freezing is based on clinical identification (by up to 3 raters) of the number of episodes from video. The aims of this study were to systematically assess this \u2018gold standard\u2019 across multiple Parkinson's disease centers, and to compare these clinical ratings with objective measures derived from lower limb acceleration data. Video recordings were acquired during a timed up-and-go task from 10 Parkinson's disease patients (with a clinical history of freezing) in the 'off' state. Patients were instrumented with accelerometers on the lateral aspect of each shank. Ten experienced clinicians were recruited from four Parkinson's disease centers to independently assess the videos for number and duration of freezing events. The reliability of clinical video assessment for number of freezing events was moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient 0.63). Percent time frozen (cumulative duration of freezing episodes/total duration of the walking task) demonstrated stronger agreement between raters (0.73). Agreement of accelerometry-derived measures of freezing severity with mean clinician ratings was strong for number of episodes (0.78) and very strong for percent time frozen (0.93). The results demonstrate the viability of objective measures of freezing, and that percent time frozen is a more reliable metric of severity than number of freezing events for both clinical and objective measures. The large variability between clinicians suggests that caution should be used when comparing subjective ratings across centers.",

The LINGO family includes LINGO-1 to LINGO-4. In two of them, LINGO-1 and LINGO-2 expressions are detectable in the adult mouse brain and appear to be restricted to neuronal tissue. Given the high degree of homology between the LINGO-1 and LINGO-2 proteins, LINGO-1 and its paralog LINGO-2 are reasonable candidate genes for PD. Recently, some variants of LINGO-1 and LINGO-2 have been reported as risk factors for developing PD in some Caucasian populations, but which has not been confirmed in others. In this study we aimed to assess whether the LINGO-2 variant (rs10968280) is associated with PD among Taiwanese. We examined the SNP of LINGO-2 gene (rs10968280 (T\u00a0>\u00a0A)) in a total of 457 PD patients (44.9% female) and 378 controls (44.9% female) recruited from neurology clinics at Linkou Chang-Gung Memorial Hospital. The frequencies of rs10968280 genotypes and alleles were similar between the PD and control group. Stratification by age at onset (<50 and \u226750 years) and sex also demonstrated no differences in the minor allele (A) frequency in either cohort. We conclude that the LINGO-2 variant rs109668280 does not contribute to the risk of developing PD in Taiwan.",

     "abstract": "Autonomic failure is a key feature of multiple system atrophy (MSA). Moreover, early autonomic failure is an independent predictive factor for rapid disease progression and shorter survival. The assessment of autonomic failure is therefore important for both, the diagnosis and prognosis of MSA. Here, we evaluate autonomic dysfunction in MSA patients by the Scopa-Aut questionnaire. Potential associations between the Scopa-Aut questionnaire and established markers of disease progression \u2013 that is the Unified MSA Rating Scale (UMSARS) \u2013 were further assessed. The results confirm early and prominent autonomic failure in MSA patients. Relative scores were highest for the sexual and urinary subdomains. Surprisingly, relative scores in the cardiovascular subdomain were lowest suggesting that the Scopa-Aut questionnaire is suboptimal for the screening and evaluation of cardiovascular symptoms in MSA. A multivariate regression showed an association between total Scopa-Aut and UMSARS I scores. No significant changes in Scopa-Aut scores were observed during follow-up except for the urinary subdomain, while UMSARS I, II and IV scores significantly increased over time. In conclusion, Scopa-Aut can be used as a simple auto-questionnaire for the screening of autonomic symptoms in multiple system atrophy. It seems not useful as endpoint for disease-modification or neuroprotection trials.",

Previous reports have described that patients with PD have premorbid personality profiles such as industriousness, inflexibility, cautiousness, and lack of novelty seeking. As well, psychological stress often aggravates RBD symptoms. These phenomena encouraged us to investigate personality profiles in iRBD patients.In this study, 53 patients with iRBD and 49 age and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. We used the revised version of the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PIR) to measure the personality of these subjects, and the 5 domains and the 30 facets of the NEO-PIR were compared between the two groups. Within the iRBD group, we investigated the association between RBD variables, e.g. the proportion of REM sleep without atonia (RWA/REM), length of RBD morbidity, frequency of vocalization or abnormal behavior, and the variables of NEO-PIR.In the patients, olfactory function was significantly lower than that of healthy controls, but the inventory differences were not significant. The inventory showed no association with any RBD variable, or the existence of aggravation of these symptoms triggered by psychological stress, or olfactory dysfunction.These results suggest that RBD patients do not have a personality profile that might predict PD development. The personality profile itself cannot explain the psychological-stress-dependent aggravation of RBD symptoms.",

Three days of trimethobenzamide, as recommended, was actually associated with more nausea than a single dose or no dose, even though a lack of association after matched analysis was found. A younger patient age was associated with hypotension. L-dopa equivalent dose modestly correlated with final apomorphine dose to turn \u201con\u201d.A previous history of nausea and hypotension, and older age should not dissuade a trial of apomorphine if clinically justified.

Normal controls had no history of neurological disease and had normal standard neuropathological studies. The PC counts were done by a neuropathologist who was blinded to the clinical diagnosis. Three different methods were used for counting PC; section through any part of the PC, through any part of the PC nucleus, and through any part of PC nucleolus. The counts were done in five non-contiguous microscopic fields.59 brains were studied. These included 12 ET, 41 PD controls, and six normal controls. The mean age at death was 82.7 in ET, 79.1 in PD, and 75.7 years in the normal controls. The mean duration of symptoms was 34 years in ET and 15.7 years in the PD cases.

     "abstract": "Over the last decades, increasing knowledge about the genetic architecture of Parkinson\u2019s disease(PD) has provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of the disorder. Recently, several studies in different populations have found a strong association between idiopathic PD and the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs356219, which is located in the 3\u2032UTR of the SNCA gene. In this study, we aimed to verify these findings and to explore further the nature of the association in a subset of Chinese Han PD patients.Four hundred and three unrelated patients with sporadic PD and 315 healthy ethnically matched control subjects were recruited consecutively for the study. Patients and normal controls were genotyped for SNCA rs356219 variant by ligase detection reaction (LDR).A statistically significant difference was found in the frequencies of the single alleles of rs356219 (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a012.986,P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) between PD patients and normal subjects.

We computed the estimates of the pooled prevalence weighted by sample size.Twelve studies were suitable for calculating prevalence rates. Ten studies provided an estimate based on subjective outcomes, which proved statistically heterogeneous (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), with a pooled prevalence estimate with random effect analysis of 35% (95% CI 28\u201341).

Objectively measured dysphagia rates were much higher, with 4 out of 5 patients being affected. This suggests that dysphagia is common in PD, but patients do not always report swallowing difficulties unless asked.

All-cause and injury mortalities and relative risk of death for those persons with PD were also examined.A historical cohort study was conducted using 5 provincial administrative databases from 1991/92 to 2000/2001. A series of algorithms based on the databases were created for case ascertainment of PD for persons 65 years or older. Crude and age-specific incidence and mortality rates were calculated using person-years of follow-up as the denominator. The impact of PD on all-cause and injury mortalities was examined using multivariate Cox regression models to provide adjusted hazard ratios.10,910 incidence cases over 6,051,682 person-years of follow-up were identified. The crude annual incidence rate was 252 per 100,000 person-years. Over the nine year period, age standardized incidence for males ranged from 207 to 396 per 100,000 person-years and 127 to 259 per 100,000 person-years for females. Persons with PD were at a 43% greater risk of all-cause mortality and specifically, 51% greater risk of injury mortality.Incidence of PD is substantially higher in advanced age with age adjusted increases for both all-cause and injury mortalities. These findings also highlight falls as a primary factor for injury mortality in PD.",

So far, only two families worldwide have been identified with this mutation. By screening DNA from seven brains of PD patients, we found one individual with seemingly sporadic PD and LRRK2 p.N1437H mutation. Clinically, the patient had levodopa-responsive PD with tremor, and developed severe motor fluctuations during a disease duration of 19 years. There was severe and painful ON-dystonia, and severe depression with suicidal thoughts during OFF. In the advanced stage, cognition was slow during motor OFF, but there was no noticeable cognitive decline. There were no signs of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus had unsatisfactory results on motor symptoms. The patient committed suicide. Neuropathological examination revealed marked cell loss and moderate alpha-synuclein positive Lewy body pathology in the brainstem. There was sparse Lewy pathology in the cortex. A striking finding was very pronounced ubiquitin-positive pathology in the brainstem, temporolimbic regions and neocortex. Ubiquitin positivity was most pronounced in the white matter, and was out of proportion to the comparatively weaker alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. Immunostaining for tau was mildly positive, revealing non-specific changes, but staining for TDP-43 and FUS was entirely negative. The distribution and shape of ubiquitin-positive lesions in this patient differed from the few previously described patients with LRRK2 mutations and ubiquitin pathology, and the ubiquitinated protein substrate remains undefined.",

The objective of this study was to examine the prevalence and demographic and clinical correlates of apathy and depression in a clinical population-based sample of patients with PD and to assess whether apathy may present as a primary behavioral disturbance independent from depression and cognitive impairment. A series of 360 PD patients underwent psychiatric investigation with the Starkstein\u2019s Apathy Scale (AS), and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), motor scoring with Hoehn and Yahr (HY) staging, and the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); and cognitive screening with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) on the same day. Apathy coexisted with depression in 133 (36.9%) of PD patients, compared with depression without apathy in 16 (4.4%), apathy without depression in 84 (23%), and neither apathy nor depression in 127 PD patients (35.2%). Apathy was associated with higher axial UPDRS impairment score, lower MMSE score, higher l-dopa dosage, and earlier HY stages, while depression was predicted by the more advanced HY stages and younger age of PD patients. These findings suggest that apathy and depression may be separable in PD, although both are common in patients with PD. Therefore these two conditions should be systematically screened and considered in the care and management of PD.",

Impaired temporal speech patterns have been contributed to dysfunctional basal ganglia circuits, but little is known about a possible differential role of right and left basal ganglia concerning speech production, although neurodegeneration in PD typically follows an asymmetrical pattern. The aim of our study was to reveal a possible influence of lateralized basal ganglia dysfunction on speech timing in PD.60 patients with PD (30 with predominant symptoms on the left-side PD_L and 30 with predominant symptoms on the right side PD_R) and 40 healthy controls were tested. Participants had to repeat a single syllable in a self chosen steady pace. Additionally, the participants performed a reading task in order to measure speaking rate related to connected speech.Syllable repetition showed a significant instability in both PD groups as compared to controls. However, the PD_L group performed in a much higher pace with further significant pace acceleration in the course of the syllable repetition task. This pattern showed a further correlation to axial motor symptoms. No correlations were seen between parameters of syllable repetition and the reading task.Lateralization of basal ganglia dysfunction in PD seems to differentially impact the stability of spontaneous syllable repetition pace. Our data suggest a crucial role of the right basal ganglia in the maintenance of isochronous speech rhythms at least in patients with additional axial motor symptoms.",

To date, there have been few candidate gene studies for primary dystonia and only two DYT genes, TOR1A and THAP1, have been assessed. We therefore employed a haplotype-tagging strategy to comprehensively assess if common polymorphisms in eight DYT genes (TOR1A, TAF1, GCH1, THAP1, MR-1 (PNKD), SGCE, ATP1A3 and PRKRA) confer risk for sporadic primary dystonia. The 230 primary dystonia cases were matched for age and gender to 228 controls, recruited from movement disorder clinics in Brisbane, Australia and the Australian electoral roll. All subjects were genotyped for 56 tagging SNPs and genotype associations were investigated. Modest genotypic associations (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were observed for three GCH1 SNPs (rs12147422, rs3759664 and rs10483639) when comparing all cases against controls. Associations were also seen when the cases were stratified based on presentation. Overall, our findings do not support the hypothesis that common TOR1A variants affect susceptibility for sporadic primary dystonia, and that it is unlikely that common variants around the DYT genes confer substantial risk for sporadic primary dystonia. Further work is warranted to follow up the GCH1 SNPs and the subgroup analyses.",

Uremic RLS (u-RLS) is the most common secondary form, but its pathophysiological mechanisms remain unsettled. Aim of this study was to explore spinal cord excitability by evaluating group I nonreciprocal (Ib) inhibition in u-RLS patients in comparison with p-RLS patients and healthy subjects.Eleven u-RLS patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis treatment, nine p-RLS patients and ten healthy subjects were studied. Soleus H reflex latency (HR-L), H max / M max ratio, and Ib inhibition were evaluated. Ib inhibition was tested measuring the amplitude changes in soleus H reflex following stimulation of the synergist gastrocnemius medialis (GM) nerve at rest. Nerve conduction studies were performed in the uremic patients.The H max / M max ratio did not differ in the three groups. The u-RLS patients showed a normal Ib inhibition comparable with the healthy group, whereas the p-RLS group had evidence of a reduced active inhibition compared with both u-RLS patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007), prominently at 5\u00a0ms (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and at 6\u00a0ms (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) of conditioning-test interval. Neurophysiological examination disclosed abnormalities ranging from higher HR-L to clear-cut polyneuropathy in most u-RLS patients.Unlike p-RLS patients, u-RLS patients had normal Ib inhibition, suggesting a regular supraspinal control of Ib spinal interneurons. Subclinical peripheral nerve abnormalities were detected in most uremic patients. Peripherally disrupted sensory modulation may represent the major pathophysiological determinant of uremic RLS.",

The apolipoprotein E gene (APOE) alleles \u03b52, \u03b53, and \u03b54 produce three different apoE isoforms with different biological effects, which can determine risks of many human diseases, including neurodegenerative and liver disease. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of APOE genotype on the variability of WD phenotypic expression.We analyzed data on 383 WD consecutive patients in the WD registry. The APOE genotypes (APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 (wild-type), APOE \u03b52-positive, and APOE \u03b54-positive) were determined and the APOE genotype effect on the phenotypic WD presentation was assessed in all symptomatic WD patients, as well as in patient subgroups divided according to sex and ATP7B genotype.APOE genotype had no impact on WD presentation in the general population of symptomatic patients. However, APOE \u03b54-positive women tended to present WD symptoms earlier than women possessing the wild-type APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 genotype (24.2 vs. 27.9 years; p\u00a0=\u00a00.08). The effect of the APOE \u03b54-positive genotype was more pronounced in ATP7B p.H1069Q homozygous women, in whom disease symptoms started almost 6 years earlier (23.6 vs. 29.9 years; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than in APOE \u03b53/\u03b53 women.In women, APOE \u03b54-positive genotype is associated with earlier onset of WD symptoms, particularly among ATP7B p.H1069Q homozygous patients.

Familial PD results from rare, highly penetrant pathogenic mutations whereas multiple variants of low penetrance may contribute to the risk of sporadic PD. Common variants implicated in PD risk appear to explain only a minor proportion of the familial clustering observed in sporadic PD. It is therefore plausible that combinations of rare and/or common variants in genes already implicated in disease pathogenesis may help to explain the genetic basis of PD.We have developed a CustomSeq Affymetrix resequencing array to enable high-throughput sequencing of 13 genes (44\u00a0kb) implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. Using the array we sequenced 269 individuals, including 186 PD patients and 75 controls, achieving an overall call rate of 96.5% and 93.6%, for two respective versions of the array, and >99.9% accuracy for five samples sequenced by capillary sequencing in parallel. We identified modest associations with common variants in SNCA and LRRK2 and a trend suggestive of an overrepresentation of rare variants in cases compared to controls for several genes. We propose that this technology offers a robust and cost-effective alternative to targeted sequencing using traditional sequencing methods, and here we demonstrate the potential of this approach for either routine clinical investigation or for research studies aimed at understanding the genetic aetiology of PD.",

     "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying the development of impulse control disorders (ICDs) like compulsive gambling, buying, sexual, and eating behaviors in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) are debated. We assessed whether allelic variants of dopamine D2 receptors (DRD2), catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and dopamine transporter (DAT) were associated with the development of ICDs in PD.We enrolled 89 idiopathic PD patients (48 without ICDs and 41 with ICDs). All patients were screened with the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview (MIDI) and fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for the ICD positive cohort. Differences in the frequency of the genotypes between ICDs and non-ICDs groups were assessed using the \u03c72 test.Genotyping was performed for variants of the DRD2 Taq1A (rs1800497), COMT Val158Met (rs4680), DAT1 (3\u2032 UTR 40\u00a0bp VNTR). Variants of DRD2 Taq1A, COMT and DAT1 were not associated with the risk of developing ICDs.In our study, there were no differences in the frequency of variant of DRD2 Taq1A, COMT and DAT1 between the two groups. Polymorphisms of dopaminergic genes do not play a relevant role in the development of ICD in PD suggesting that ICD originate from inability to filter inappropriate behaviors triggered by dopaminergic therapy.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a common, treatable movement disorder that often remains undiagnosed despite clinically manifest symptoms. Screening for parkinsonism could lead to improved detection and earlier treatment, and facilitate research studies of PD prevalence. In order to determine the feasibility of screening, this study evaluated the validity of previously developed screening questionnaires. We systematically searched online databases PubMed and EMBASE for English-language studies published between 1980 and 2009. In each database a \u201cParkinson(s) disease\u201d or \u201cparkinsonism\u201d term was combined with a screening term (\u201cscreening instrument,\u201d \u201cscreening questionnaire,\u201d \u201cscreen\u201d or \u201cprevalence survey\u201d) and a validity term (\u201cvalidation,\u201d \u201csensitivity\u201d and \u201cspecificity\u201d). Included studies reported the psychometric properties of at least one self-report questionnaire for parkinsonism. Twenty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. From these studies, 9 screening questionnaires were identified. Sensitivity and specificity estimates varied widely. Sensitivity estimates were as high as 100% when questionnaires were tested among previously diagnosed PD patients and included a high number of parkinsonism specific items, but were as low as 48% when tested among early cases in a community-based sample. Specificity estimates were lower, ranging from 22 to 100%. An older sample, presence of multiple co-morbid conditions and lower literacy led to lower specificity estimates. Higher specificity estimates were seen when the screening questionnaires were administered by a physician. Screening questionnaires can detect symptomatic parkinsonism. However, the performance of these questionnaires varied based on the individual items, study sample, and method of administration. The performance of screening questionnaires in the detection of early or mild parkinsonism was modest.",

The aim of this study was to investigate changes in TCS in a larger group of clinically stable patients with Wilson\u2019s disease (WD), and to correlate them with demographic and clinical data. TCS was conducted in 54 consecutive, clinically stable patients with WD who were classified as predominantly neurologic or hepatic form of the disease and were adequately assessable by TCS from both sides. TCS revealed significantly higher prevalence of SN (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and LN hyperechogenicity (0.001) in WD patients when compared to controls. Moderate to marked SN hyperechogenicity was found in 31.5% of WD patients (in 42% and 7% of those with neurologic and hepatic form of WD, respectively) and in 8% of healthy controls. Disease severity correlated with the hyperechogenicity of SN (r\u00a0=\u00a00.303; p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) and with the width of the third ventricle (r\u00a0=\u00a00.351; p\u00a0=\u00a00.011).

However, gait impairment may also result from other PD symptoms including slowing, motor asymmetry, gait variability, dystonia or stooped posture.The Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Older Americans Resources and Services Disability Scale (OARS) and the SF-12 Health Status Survey were used to evaluate patients with PD. Responses to UPDRS Items #14 (Freezing) and # 29 (Gait) were used to create 4 subgroups: 1) No FOG or gait impairment, 2) FOG, no gait impairment, 3) Gait impairment, no FOG, and 4) Both FOG and gait impairment. Disease severity, disability, and quality of life were compared across the subgroups with ANOVAs, and between subgroups with t-tests.916 PD patients were divided into 4 subgroups based on their gait and freezing score (#1: n\u00a0=\u00a0213, #2: n\u00a0=\u00a041, #3: n\u00a0=\u00a0323 and #4: n\u00a0=\u00a0339). Total UPDRS progressively increased from Group 1 through Group 4 (1\u00a0=\u00a025.2, 2\u00a0=\u00a033.7, 3\u00a0=\u00a039.2, 4\u00a0=\u00a059.2; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Group 3 (Gait impairment, no FOG) showed greater disease severity than Group 2 (FOG, no gait impairment; Total and Motor UPDRS; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but the difference did not reach significance for disability or quality of life.Gait impairment without FOG was associated with greater disease severity than FOG without gait impairment. The combination of gait impairment and FOG was associated with the greatest disease severity and disability. These results show differential effects of diverse features of gait impairment in PD and demonstrate the importance of gait features unrelated to freezing.",

Disease severity was measured at each time-point using the progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale. Rates of ventricular expansion and rates of atrophy of the whole brain, superior frontal lobe, thalamus, caudate and midbrain were calculated. Rates of atrophy and clinical decline were used to calculate sample sizes required to power placebo-controlled treatment trials over 6 and 12-months. Rates of whole brain, thalamus and midbrain atrophy, and ventricular expansion, were increased over 6 and 12-months in progressive supranuclear palsy compared to controls. The progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale increased by 9 points over 6-months, and 18 points over 12-months. The smallest sample size estimates for treatment trials over 6-months were achieved using rate of midbrain atrophy, followed by rate of whole brain atrophy and ventricular expansion. Sample size estimates were further reduced over 12-month intervals. Sample size estimates for the progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale were worse than imaging measures over 6-months, but comparable over 12-months. Atrophy and clinical decline can be detected over 6-months in progressive supranuclear palsy. Sample size estimates suggest that treatment trials could be performed over this interval, with rate of midbrain atrophy providing the best outcome measure.",

Several independent GWAS and metanalysis studies have shown a genome-wide significant association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the \u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) regions. Here we investigated the role of SNCA and MAPT as PD susceptibility genes in a large Italian population of 904 patients and 891 controls. An evaluation of gene\u2013gene and gene-environment interactions in association with PD was also attempted.The SNCA Rep1 microsatellite was genotyped by a fluorescent PCR assay, whereas the SNPlex genotyping system was used to genotype 12 additional markers across the SNCA gene, and 2 SNPs tagging the risk MAPT H1 haplotype.Single-marker analysis demonstrated nominal evidence of association for: i) the 261-bp-long allele of Rep1; ii) 7 SNPs in the SNCA region (top SNP: rs356186, P\u00a0=\u00a03.08\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221204, intron 4); iii) both SNPs identifying the MAPT H1 haplotype (P\u00a0=\u00a04.63\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221204 and P\u00a0=\u00a04.23\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221204 for rs1800547 and rs9468, respectively).

Postural sway was measured using center of pressure (CoP) root mean square displacement (RMSCoP) and mean velocity (VCoP) in the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) directions.All CoP parameters were larger in moderate/advanced subjects vs controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and early subjects. Only RMSCoPML was larger in early subjects vs controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Med, DBS and DBS\u00a0+\u00a0med decreased UPDRS III compared to off-med (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). RMSCoPML and VCoPML were larger on-med vs off-med and vs DBS (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Compared to controls and PD subjects with normal CoP sway off-med, med increased all CoP parameters (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but DBS returned VCoPML to normal values. For \u2018abnormal\u2019 PD subjects, STN-DBS improved the excessive VCoP in ML compared to off and on-med pre-DBS (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Postural sway in quiet stance increased with disease severity. Only ML CoP displacement was abnormal in early stage PD, and this may be a compensatory mechanism. Medication increased ML postural sway. In \u2018normal\u2019 PD subjects, STN-DBS reversed medication induced postural instability. Subjects with abnormal balance in quiet stance did not benefit from medication or DBS, except for improvement in ML CoP velocity from DBS. This may serve to reduce postural instability and falling.",

Control subjects were 65 age-matched patient spouses without neurological or spinal disorders.There were no differences in age or sex between PD patients and controls. The frequencies of anterior and lateral flexion of the trunk were significantly higher in PD patients than in controls. The frequency and severity of anterior and lateral flexion and the incidence of dropped head increased as the disease progressed. Other factors related to anterior and lateral flexion included age, disease duration, lower MMSE score, lumbago and levodopa equivalent daily dose of dopaminergic drugs. Women tended to develop more severe anterior flexion than men. Anterior flexion severity also correlated with that of lateral flexion and the emergence of dropped head.Postural disorders are frequent complications in PD patients and their severity increases with disease progression. Advancing age and disease severity may be the major risks for developing postural disorders.",

Genetic variations in the leucine-rich repeat and lg domain containing nogo receptor-interacting protein genes (LINGO1 and LINGO2) were reported to be associated with an increased risk of developing ET. To explore whether the LINGO4 gene (a homologous gene of the LINGO1 and the LINGO2 genes) plays a role in ET susceptibility, we performed genetic analysis of coding region of the LINGO4 gene in 100 patients with ET from Mainland China. Two nucleotide variants had been identified: (1) T\u00a0>\u00a0A transition (rs61746299), predicted to lead to the amino acid change Thr444Ser, and (2) C\u00a0>\u00a0T transition (rs1521179), located 12 bp downstream to the end of coding region. To evaluate whether these variants are related to ET susceptibility, we investigated a total of 150 Chinese Han ET patients (77 familial ET and 73 sporadic ET) and 300 sex, age and ethnicity matched normal controls. No significant differences in genotypic and allele distributions between patients and control subjects for rs61746299 and rs1521179 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.531 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.867 for genotypic distributions; p\u00a0=\u00a01.000 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.844 for allele distributions) were observed, suggesting variants in coding region of the LINGO4 gene may play litter or no role in the risk of ET susceptibility.",

The objective of this review is to investigate the relationships between gait impairments and activity limitations in people with idiopathic PD. Six electronic databases (MEDLINE ISI, CINAHL, Web of Science ISI, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Scopus) were systematically searched using relevant terms to source for English-language studies published between 1900 and January 2011. Only studies that reported associations between impairments and activity limitations were considered for the review. The methodological quality of eligible studies was evaluated using a customized checklist by two independent reviewers. Data on participant characteristics, disease severity and associations between variables were extracted using a standardized data extraction form. Correlation coefficients were transformed to standardized scores and pooled using the fixed or random effects models. 16 of the 1735 studies screened were included, comprising 1882 participants.

Clearer understanding of the pathophysiology of hemiballism has led to important insights into the function and interaction of structures within the basal ganglia. Newer models of basal ganglia function have been proposed based on the study of the pathophysiology of hemiballism.

Ability to work and ability to live independently were based on clinical interview and examination. Cox regression models adjusted for age and disease duration were used to evaluate associations of baseline characteristics with loss of ability to work and loss of ability to live independently.Higher UPDRS dyskinesia score, UPDRS instability score, UPDRS total score, Hoehn and Yahr stage, and presence of intellectual impairment at baseline were all associated with increased risk of future loss of ability to work and loss of ability to live independently (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.0033).

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been shown to play an important role in the survival of dopaminergic neurons and its genetic polymorphism was associated with an increased risk for PD at an older age onset.

The most effective test to provoke FOG was rapid 360\u00b0 turns in both directions and, if negative, combined with a gait trajectory with dual tasking. Repeated testing improved the diagnostic yield. The least informative tests included wide turns, 180\u00b0 turns or normal speed full turns. Sensitivity to provoke objective FOG in subjective freezers was 0.65 for the rapid full turns in both directions and 0.63 for the FOG trajectory.The most efficient way to objectively ascertain FOG is asking patients to repeatedly make rapid 360\u00b0 narrow turns from standstill, on the spot and in both directions.",

Pearson's correlations were analyzed between these scales and the RS-15.Greater resilience correlated with less disability (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.30, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01), and better physical and\u00a0mental QoL (r\u00a0=\u00a0.31, p\u00a0<\u00a0.01; r\u00a0=\u00a0.29, p\u00a0=\u00a0.01), but not with PD severity (T-UPDRS, r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.17, p\u00a0>\u00a0.05). Among non-motor symptoms and personality domains, resilience strongly correlated with less apathy (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.66), less depression (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.49), and more optimism (r\u00a0=\u00a0.54, all p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Moderate correlations were seen between more resilience, reduced fatigue (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.40) and anxiety (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.34; both p\u00a0<\u00a0.001).Resilience correlated with less disability and better QoL but not with PD severity. Resilience was also highly associated with both non-motor symptoms (less apathy, depression, fatigue) and a personality domain (more optimism). The role of resilience in helping patients adapt to living with symptoms of chronic disease may explain its lack of correlation with PD severity.",

The GBA gene was sequenced and, in a subset of patients and in normal volunteers, GBA enzyme activity was measured.We have identified nine index MJD/SCA3 patients with parkinsonian manifestations. Overall, GBA sequence variations were found in 3/9 MJD/SCA3 index cases with parkinsonian manifestations (33%) and in 0/40 MJD/SCA3 controls without parkinsonism (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03, Fisher exact test). The GBA sequence variations found were p.K(-27)R, p.E326K, and p.T369M. The latter two sequence variations were also found in two symptomatic relatives with no parkinsonian manifestations. A MJD/SCA3 relative belonging to the first positive pedigree and carrier of the p.K(-27)R mutation also presented parkinsonian manifestations. GBA activity in MJD/SCA3 patients was similar to those found in the normal control group.Sequence variations at the GBA gene may play a role as a minor, modifying gene of MJD/SCA3 phenotype.

     "abstract": "Impairments in executive functions are frequently reported in Parkinson's disease (PD). However, little is known about patients' experience regarding these impairments. This knowledge is crucial because if patients do not experience their cognitive impairments they do not report them to their attending neurologist. Consequently, patients might not get appropriate treatment. This study investigated if patients with a mild to moderate PD experience impairments in executive functions in daily life and whether these correspond with impairments as measured in neuropsychological assessments.Forty-three PD patients and 25 healthy participants were included. Groups did not differ in age, sex and education. All participants and their closest relatives completed a standardized questionnaire measuring executive functions in daily life. Furthermore, all participants were assessed with a test battery measuring executive functions.PD patients reported significantly more problems with executive functions in daily life than healthy participants. Furthermore, co-morbid depression had a negative impact on the number of problems with executive functions in daily life as reported by PD patients. The experienced daily life problems in executive functions were not associated with the patients' performance on objective cognitive measures.In conclusion, PD patients were aware of problems with executive functions in daily life and reported considerably more problems than healthy controls. These problems were however not reflected by neuropsychological tests and may indicate a lack of ecological validity of neuropsychological assessment.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: Dopaminergic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for restless legs syndrome (RLS). We analyzed the frequency and clinical characteristics of impulse control disorders (ICD) in patients with RLS on transdermal rotigotine treatment. Methods: Retrospective case series at a university movement disorder clinic (n\u00a0=\u00a028, 17 women). Symptoms of ICD were assessed via detailed history taking and scoring with the Zurich Screening Questionnaire for ICD (ZICD) prior to and after initiation of treatment. Results: None of the patients had a history of ICD prior to treatment. Baseline mean scores for patients who did (8.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5) and did not (6.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7) develop ICD under treatment did not differ. Six male patients (21%) developed various symptoms of ICD (mean ZICD scores 20.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.2) on rotigotine treatment (mean dose: 3.8\u00a0mg/d), including binge eating, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping, pathological gambling, and punding, equaling a prevalence rate of 21%. Also in the non-ICD group, ZICD scores increased (7.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8). Conclusion: This is the first report of ICD in patients treated with transdermal rotigotine for RLS. In contrast to literature, even low doses of rotigotine (mean 3.8\u00a0mg/d) can cause ICD. Therefore every prescribing physician should be aware that ICD may emerge in both RLS and PD patients on any dopaminergic treatment, and should actively ask for such symptoms. The ZICD questionnaire not only replicated the findings of detailed history taking but also showed an increased tendency towards impulsive behaviour in subjects that did not develop ICD.",

The relationships between ICDs and DBS treatment of the motor complications of Parkinson\u2019s disease remain unclear. We describe 50 consecutive patients in whom detailed neuropsychiatric assessments were performed as part of our routine pre-operative assessment. Eight had current or past ICDs during pre-operative assessment. These patients were more likely to be male and were younger than those without ICDs. Other psychosocial variables did not predict the presence of ICDs. Detailed neuropsychological examination failed to show any between-group differences. Our prevalence rate of 16% helps raise awareness of ICDs in this specialised clinic population and may reflect common denominators between significant motor fluctuations and dopaminergic drug \u2013 related behavioural disturbances. Four patients were deemed suitable for surgery after multi-disciplinary assessment. One had re-emergence of his ICD 18 months post-operatively, the ICD having resolved in the first 18 months.

Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) were similarly studied as a disease control. The results obtained were compared with the clinical characteristics of the patients and statistically analyzed.WMHs in patients with MSA were statistically greater compared with PD patients or controls. There were no significant differences in either lacunar or territorial infarcts. Multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated that age, supine systolic blood pressure, and a drop in orthostatic blood pressure were significantly and independently correlated with WMH scores in MSA.The present study suggests that white matter is differentially involved in MSA. In addition to aging, cerebral hypoperfusions caused by fluctuations of blood pressure may be a significant contributing factor to WMHs in MSA, although the possibility that degenerative processes occurring in oligodendrocytes may be associated with WMHs should not be excluded.",

With appropriate advanced ToM, one can behave well in social interactions and can understand the intention of others\u2019 behavior. Prefrontal cortex plays a vital role in this ability, as shown in functional brain imaging and lesion studies. Considering the primary neuropathology of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) involving the frontal lobe system, patients with PD are expected to exhibit deficits in advanced ToM. However, few studies on this issue have been explored, and whether advanced ToM is independent of executive functions remains uncertain. Thirty-nine early non-demented PD patients and 40 normal control subjects were included. Both groups were matched in age, level of education, and verbal intelligence quotient. Each participant received advanced ToM, executive functions, and verbal intelligence quotient tests. We discovered that the performance of the PD patients on the Cartoon ToM task was significantly poorer than that of their normal counterparts. Correlation analysis revealed that performance scores of advanced ToM in PD patients were significantly associated with their executive functions scores; however, this is not the case for normal controls. We conclude that dysfunction of advanced ToM develops in early PD patients, who require more cognitive abilities than their normal counterparts to generate advanced ToM. Our findings might be helpful in developing educational and medical care programs for PD patients in the future.",

We studied twenty-four patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease who self-reported significant freezing while in their practically-defined \u2018off\u2019 state. Prior to clinical assessment they completed both freezing of gait questionnaires before being video-recorded while performing a series of timed up-and-go tasks, which incorporated turning, rotating and passing through narrow gaps. The rating of video recordings by two independent observers identified a total of 530 freezing events. The frequency and duration of freezing episodes for each patient were calculated and correlated with questionnaire ratings. Scores on either questionnaire did not correlate with either the frequency or duration of freezing episodes experienced by patients during objective assessment. These results suggest the need to re-evaluate the utility of questionnaires in the assessment of freezing of gait. Furthermore, these results highlight the need for accurate objective methods of identifying freezing events when assessing future clinical interventions aimed at reducing this potentially disabling symptom of Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

We report our clinical series of DHS arising in the setting of parkinsonism.Patients with DHS were initially identified by a retrospective computer search of the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) medical record database from January 1997 to July 2010. Subsequent record review confirmed DHS and documented those with parkinsonism.We identified 21 patients with DHS and parkinsonism, 12 male, 9, female. The median age of DHS onset was 69 years (interquartile range: 63.6\u201377.5 years). This included 10 patients with Parkinson\u2018s disease (PD), 10 with MSA, and 1 with drug-induced parkinsonism. The DHS component of their disorder segregated into three different subgroups: dystonia-alone (12 patients); myopathy-alone (4 patients; focal cervical myopathy in 3 and generalized myopathy in one); coexisting dystonia and myopathy (5 patients; 3 generalized, 2 focal cervical myopathy).DHS may be seen in either MSA or PD.

In the patients with PD, the only variable associated with the H/M ratio was age at onset of the disease.",

     "abstract": "Isolated action tremor (IAT) is the hallmark clinical feature of essential tremor (ET), but it may also be a prominent feature of some individuals with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) suggesting a pathogenic relationship between these two disorders.We investigated the integrity of the striatal presynaptic dopaminergic system in subjects presenting IAT to improve the diagnostic accuracy and to explore any putative relationships between ET and PD.The striatal dopaminergic system was examined by means of dopamine transporter imaging using 123I-(fluoropropyl)-2\u00df-carbomethoxy-3\u00df-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane ([123I]-FP-CIT) single-photon emission tomography (DAT-SPECT) in a clinical series of individuals with IAT, excluding those with associated resting tremor and bradykinesia.Among 167 incidental individuals with IAT eligible for DAT-SPECT (Male/Female\u00a0=\u00a058.9/41.1%; Age\u00a0=\u00a067.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.3 years), reduced striatal uptake was observed in 114 out of 167 (68.3%), whereas normal striatal binding was observed in the remaining 53 subjects (31.7%). Onset of tremor after 50 years and asymmetrical distribution of tremor were predictive variables of nigrostriatal denervation, whereas gender, family history and the presence of intentional, cephalic or voice tremors were not associated with nigrostriatal denervation.Our findings suggest that IAT is a frequent presenting symptom in a subset of individuals with PD, often misdiagnosed as ET, and that DAT-SPECT can help differentiate between these two disorders. Current diagnostic criteria for ET should be revised to include asymmetry and late-onset tremor as predictors of nigrostriatal denervation.",

     "abstract": "Although non-motor manifestations of Parkinson\u2019s disease are common and can cause severe disability, they are often under-recognized, leading to missed treatment opportunities. Screening tools for non-motor symptoms are urgently needed. Recently a 30\u2013item screening Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire was developed. Although some psychometric properties have been evaluated, sensitivity and specificity of the questionnaire have not been systematically assessed.Parkinson patients completed Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire, then underwent a gold-standard clinical evaluation of non-motor symptoms and signs that included extensive standardized questionnaires, cognitive/behavioural assessment, and neurological examination to determine whether each manifestation was present or absent. The sensitivity and specificity of each non-motor symptom, in relation to the gold-standard were estimated.For the 70 participants, the mean age was 66.7+/\u22129.3, 64% were men, and disease duration was 3.8+/\u22122.8 years. From the gold-standard evaluation, the prevalence of non-motor manifestations ranged from 8.7% (hallucinations) to 78.3% (nocturia). The mean sensitivity of all Non Motor Symptoms was 63.4%. This varied considerably among different manifestations, ranging from 24% (sleepiness, hyposmia) to 100% (diplopia). By restricting analysis to clinically significant non-motor problems (i.e. those serious enough to warrant treatment), the mean sensitivity increased to 71.8%. The specificity for most items was high, with an overall mean specificity of 88.5%.For many non-motor manifestations Non Motor Symptoms Questionnaire is an effective screen; however, for manifestations such as somnolence, olfactory loss and apathy, sensitivity is suboptimal. Overall, this questionnaire can be a useful clinical tool for screening non-motor problems in an office setting.",

However the neural basis for these clinical effects have not yet been demonstrated.We investigated the effects of repeated sessions of cerebellar continuous theta burst stimulation in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with levodopa induced dyskinesia on brain metabolism by means of positron emission tomography scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) to characterize the specific cerebral network activated by cerebellar stimulation in these patients.We found that five days of bilateral cerebellar continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) were effective in reducing levodopa induced dyskinesia. Clinical changes were paralleled by a reduction of 18F-FDG metabolism in the cerebellum as revealed by positron emission tomography imaging. We found a global decrease in the metabolism of the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres, and a significant decrease in 18F-FDG uptake in correspondence of bilateral dentate nucleus.Our study demonstrates the antidyskinetic effect of cerebellar cTBS in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients with levodopa induced dyskinesia, is paralleled by modulation of the activity of the pathways connecting the cerebellar cortex with the deep cerebellar nuclei, confirming the hypothesis that the motor cerebellar circuit is involved in the generations of levodopa induced dyskinesia.",

Unilateral STN DBS also improves motor function in PD, but its effects on sleep have not been extensively investigated.We report the effects of unilateral STN DBS on subjective sleep quality as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) in 53 consecutive PD patients.

One possible reason for the difficulty in finding mutations underlying PD is that rare predominantly brain-situated somatic mutations underlie the disease; these mutations would be missed by analysing blood DNA only. To test the feasibility of looking for somatic mutations in PD brain tissue, we compared copy number variants (CNVs) between 8 PD and 26 control brains using Affymetrix 6.0 arrays. The median number of CNVs per brain, and the overall proportion of amplifications and deletions, were similar in PD and control brains. In 7 of the 8 PD brains, however, a total of 45 CNVs were found that were not present in control brains. Twelve of these CNVs overlapped with one or more genes, some of which are involved in pathways suspected in the pathogenesis of PD, or are rare. This study shows that PD brain CNVs can be detected, and raises the possibility that brain-situated mutations could underlie some cases of PD. A method of undertaking a definitive study of brain somatic mutations in PD, using massively parallel sequencing and multiple tissues, is suggested.",

This was done by performing high resolution melt (HRM) as well as multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analyses. In total, seven patients (3.1%; 7/229) had either compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations in parkin, and seven patients (3.1%) had heterozygous sequence variants. Two of the patients with parkin mutations are of Black African ancestry. Reverse-transcription PCR on lymphocytes obtained from two patients verified the presence of parkin mutations on both alleles.

Over time, disease burden slowly accumulates resulting in diminished health status. Many clinicians consider the 10 year disease duration mark as significant, however the clinical status and health-related quality of life of patients reaching this milestone have not been well documented.A cross-sectional study was performed on PD patients with \u226510 years disease duration (PD-10) (n\u00a0=\u00a01835) included in the multicenter National Parkinson's Foundation Quality Improvement Initiative (NPF-QII). Demographic, clinical and health-related quality of life data was analyzed.PD-10 patients (62.2% male) had a mean age of 67.8 years (\u00b19.5) with a mean age of PD onset of 52.7 years (\u00b110.6), and median disease duration 14.3 years (interquartile range 11.5\u201318.1). Many were minimally disabled with Hoehn and Yahr stage 1 or 2 (44.0%) or experiencing postural instability (HY stage 3, 40.3%). Most (88.2%) were able to stand unaided, but falls were common (54.8%). Almost all were living at home (93.1%) with a family member as a regular caregiver (83.8%). PD-10 patients had an average of 1.9 (\u00b11.4) co-morbidities, with arthritis (48.9%) and heart problems (31.7%) most commonly encountered. The majority (86.7%) took at least 2 medications: levodopa (95.7%), dopamine agonists (45.6%) and antidepressants (37.3%) were most commonly recorded. Most PD-10 patients were not currently utilizing physical, occupational or speech therapy, although two-thirds reported engaging in physical activity. Deep brain stimulation was documented in 22.4%. Overall the mean health-related quality of life and caregiver burden was impaired in all domains.Our data on PD patients with at least 10 years disease duration confirmed the younger age of onset of PD, but not the higher proportion of females or rest tremor, or the lower proportion of Caucasians seen in other aged PD cohorts. PD-10 patients had increased disease burden, increased caregiver burden, and impaired health-related quality of life. Although subjects mostly remained independently mobile, balance could be impaired with frequent falls identified. The prevalence of PD-10 patients living at home (93%) was very high in our sample which was drawn from specialty clinics, compared to prior studies reporting up to 27% PD patients institutionalized at 10 years duration. Thus policies to improve in-home support and caregiver support will be crucial in efforts aimed at maintaining patients in a home setting.",

In Parkinson's disease (PD) the negative impact of providing care has been referred to as caregiver strain. Grief has not been explored in PD caregivers, and understanding grief may offer new insights for future intervention.Volunteer caregivers (n\u00a0=\u00a074) filled out the Marwit and Meuser Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI-SF) which measures 3 types (i.e. subscales) of grief: Personal Sacrifice and Burden, Heartfelt Sadness and Longing, Worry and Felt Isolation. This scale also provided a total grief score. Volunteer caregivers also responded to self-reported UPDRS questions about the motor and non-motor symptoms of their PD relative (i.e. spouse or parent). T-tests were used to correlate CG subscales of grief with patient variables. A hierarchical regression analysis was used to determine the predictive contribution of motor and nonmotor symptoms to grief.Grief based on the total score was found in 17% of CGs. Grief was significantly higher in CG's whose relative had more severe symptoms. The type of grief experienced was similar across all three subscales. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that nonmotor symptoms explained slightly more of the variance (14\u201323%) than motor symptoms (11\u201317%).This study revealed that pre-death grief is a significant finding in PD caregivers. The severity of symptoms and the presence of nonmotor symptoms, especially cognitive decline, predict caregivers who are at greatest risk of prolonged grief; however it should be kept in mind that motor symptoms also contribute.",

While the monogenic forms of PARK disorders have been reviewed extensively, it is not easy to do differential diagnosis of PARK disorders due to the additional features except for typical parkinsonism. In this presentation, we focus on two different scenarios of patients with autosomal dominant parkinsonism: (1) parkinsonism with mutations in one of the PARK genes; (2) parkinsonism with mutations other than PARK genes or yet other genes where parkinsonism is a well recognized, concomitant, or even an isolated feature.",

     "abstract": "Several forms of autosomal recessive parkinsonism are known. In three forms, caused by mutations in parkin (PARK2), PINK1 (PARK6), or DJ-1 (PARK7), the phenotype is usually characterized by levodopa-responsive parkinsonism without atypical features. Parkin mutations are most frequent, explaining \u223c50% of the cases with a clinical diagnosis of familial Parkinson's disease compatible with recessive inheritance and onset <45 years, and \u223c15% of the sporadic cases with onset <45. Mutations in PINK1 and DJ-1 are less common, accounting for \u223c1\u20138%, and \u223c1\u20132% of the sporadic cases with early-onset. Since point mutations and genomic rearrangements can be present, sequencing and exon dosage are both required for accurate mutational screening of these genes. The phenotype of parkin mutations is characterized by early-onset parkinsonism, good response to levodopa, and benign course. The average onset age is in the 30s, but late-onset cases have been described. The phenotype associated with PINK1 and DJ-1 mutations has been studied in a smaller number of patients but it is overall indistinguishable from that of parkin. Mutations in other genes, including ATP13A2 (PARK9), PLA2G6 (PARK14), and FBX07 (PARK15), cause more rare forms of recessive parkinsonism with very early-onset (<30 years) and usually additional, atypical features (pyramidal, dystonic, ocular movement, and cognitive disturbances). Yet, it is expected that other monogenic forms of parkinsonism will be identified in the future, as mutations in the above-mentioned genes are not found in other patients with similar phenotypes.",

     "abstract": "Over the past two decades the understanding and classification of Parkinson's disease (PD) has been revolutionized by genetic research. Currently, sixteen PARK loci have been identified with autosomal dominant genes such as SNCA, and LRRK2, and autosomal recessive genes such as PRKN, DJ-1, and PINK1. Among these genes, LRRK2 is the most prevalent. Additionally, susceptibility variants located on some of these genes are widely recognized as risk factors for PD in certain ethnic populations. Alpha synuclein Lewy body (LB) pathology, the hallmark of sporadic PD, is predominantly seen in carriers of SNCA and LRRK2. Recently two new autosomal dominant PD genes have been discovered, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4-gamma (EIF4G1) and vacuolar protein sorting 35 (VPS35). EIF4G1 is associated with LB pathology; however, only limited data currently exists on pathology of the VPS35. Thus, it remains to be seen if LB pathology can be identified on autopsy examination of carriers of VPS35 gene. The mechanism behind the cause of PD has yet to be elucidated; however, genetic studies on autosomal dominant PD have provided novel insights into the potential etiology of PD. Thus, paving the way for future targeted therapies aimed at disease prevention and cure.",

Thus, a disease that is driven by the accumulation and aggregation of misfolded proteins, in case of PD \u03b1-synuclein (aSyn) is incriminated. Accordingly, removal of aSyn is assumed of having the potential to modify the course of the disease. Both active and passive aSyn targeting immunotherapy were found to modify disease in mice overexpressing human aSyn and recapitulating various aspects of synucleopathies. Translating immunotherapy to humans needs to consider the issue of potential autoimmunity. PD vaccines developed by AFFiRiS integrate the safety concept as applied for the company's AD vaccine candidates. This includes the use of short antigens, precluding activation of aSyn-specific T cells and, thus, cellular autoimmunity. Moreover, the selection of AFFITOPES\u00ae for clinical development is based on the principle of exclusive aSyn reactivity of vaccine-induced Abs excluding crossreactivity to \u03b2-synuclein (bSyn), which is ensured by the AFFITOME\u00ae platform technology.

While the lineage restriction of adult neural stem cells limits their clinical applicability for patients with PD, human pluripotent stem cells provide an opportunity to replace specific types of degenerating neurons. Now, cellular reprogramming technology can provide patientspecific neurons for neural transplantation and problems with cell fate specification and safety are resolving. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived neurons are also a unique tool for interpreting the genetic basis for an individual's risk of developing PD into clinically meaningful information. For example, clinical trials for neuroprotective molecules need to be tested in presymptomatic individuals when the neurons can still be protected. Patient-specific neural cells can also be used to identify an individual's responsiveness to drugs and to understand the mechanisms of the disease.

The etiology of sporadic PD is not fully understood but several lines of evidence suggest that genetic vulnerability and environmental toxicants converge to incite pathology-the multiple hit hypothesis. One gene linked to both familial and sporadic PD is SNCA, which encodes for the protein a-synuclein that has a propensity to misfold into toxic moieties. Here we show that a-synuclein directly activates microglia inciting the production of proinflammatory molecules and altering the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We discuss the role for \u03b1-synuclein-directed TLR expression changes in PD and the therapeutic potential of modifying this response.",

A second wave of targets came from basic research, enabled by the low morbidity, reversibility, and adaptability of DBS. This was the case for the subthalamic nucleus (STN) which improves the triad of dopaminergic symptoms, and the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) for gait disorders in PD. The new concepts of the role of basal ganglia in psychiatric disorders indicate the subgenual cortex CG 25 for severe resistant depression, the accumbens nucleus for depression, anorexia nervosa, and addiction, and the thalamus intralaminar nuclei for minimally conscious states. Serendipity and a scientific approach have provided several instances where targets have produced unexpected effects (such as STN in OCD), as well as limbic effects observed during attempts at VMH stimulation for obesity: this might offer a novel way to treat mild cognitive impairment, or memory deficits reported in Alzheimer's disease.

Its characterization has allowed for a re-grouping of diseases according to the expected pathology. The clinical syndrome of PD can now be classified into forms with and without alpha-synuclein pathology. DLB and PDD are synucleinopathies, and MSA shows alpha-synuclein pathology with glial inclusions. ADHD symptoms commonly occur in persons that will subsequently develop DLB. A similar phenomenon may be the early personality changes and frontotemporal atrophy in patients with SNCA multiplication. RLS is not known to have alpha-synuclein pathology, but as PD and ADHD, involves a hypodopaminergic state. Furthermore, PD and RLS co-occur in families in a way that suggests common inheritance. A proportion of patients with ET have brainstem Lewy body pathology. Gaucher disease and other lysosomal storage disorders also have alpha-synuclein pathology. Alpha-synuclein is a naturally unfolded protein. Non-fibrillar oligomeres may be the toxic species, and Lewy body formation may in fact be protective. Inhibiting alpha-synuclein toxicity seems to be an attractive novel treatment strategy and several approaches are being developed. When such treatments become available, clinicians will need to be familiar with the clinical features that distinguish the synucleinopathies from their look-alikes.",

Here, we first review the prevalence of alpha-synuclein neuropathology in elderly and discuss its clinical relevance in Parkinson patients. Subsequently, the results of a retrospective study focussing on the distribution of neuropathology in Parkinson patients with a tremor-dominant (TD), non-tremordominant (NTD) or rapid disease progression (RDP) subtype are presented. The study population recruited by the Netherlands Brain bank consisted of 149 non-neurological donors, 26 donors with incidental Lewy body disease (iLBD) and 111 Parkinson patients. In total, 89% of these cases could be classified in accordance with the Braak staging when taking into account the severity of alpha-synuclein pathology and adding an amygdala-predominant category of synucleinopathy. The pathological progression seemed to be non-linear. Interestingly, a strong correlation between neuronal loss and alpha-synuclein pathology was observed in the substantia nigra in Braak stages 3\u20136 (P < 0.01). However, there was no correlation between Hoehn & Yahr and Braak stages. Neuropathological progression may, however, vary between subtypes as cortical Lewy body load and Braak stages were higher in patients with NTD compared to TD and Alzheimer pathology was more prevalent in RDP patients. Recognition of clinical subtypes in neuropathological studies is essential to identify selective vulnerability to protein accumulation that may determine the clinical phenotype in PD.",

Early in the course of PD, depression and expectations about impending demise impact significantly on the quality of life of patients. Initial responses to medical therapy may also dictate patients' expectations. Later, the two most devastating features may be motor instability/falls/injury and dementia.Mounting evidence for the benefits of treatment aimed at these arenas is accumulating and revolves around recognition and facilitating healthy routines that may mitigate future negative clinical phenomenon.

Currently, the most advanced studies of this technique involve delivery of an adeno-associated viral vector encoding glutamic acid decarboxylase into the subthalamic nucleus. This treatment has shown modest benefit in early clinical trials. Other gene therapies, in various stages of human clinical trials, include gene transfer for the production of trophic factors, for aromatic amino acid decarboxylase alone, and most recently, a lentiviral vector transfer of an enzymatic dopamine \u201cfactory\u201d consisting of three essential enzymes required for production for this neurotransmitter.",

MCI refers to a clinical syndrome with impairment in one or more cognitive domains, with essentially normal performance of activities of daily living. Patients with the amnesic subtype of MCI often develop the dementia syndrome and neuroimaging findings characteristic of AD [e.g., hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), temporoparietal and posterior cingulate hypometabolism on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), positive uptake on amyloid PET, normal striatonigral uptake on dopamine transporter scanning (DAT), etc.]. In contrast, the MCI syndrome associated with LBD pathology regardless of the coexisting presence or absence of parkinsonism is usually characterized by impairment in the executive and/or visuospatial domains, and the cognitive features are often preceded by REM sleep behavior disorder by many years. There is minimal hippocampal atrophy on MRI, minimal if any cortical uptake on amyloid-PET, and one would predict that hypometabolism would be maximal in the occipital cortex on FDG-PET and uptake would be decreased on DAT. The early data suggests that differentiating underlying AD vs LBD in the MCI phase will be feasible.",

Initially, research focused on the selective neurotransmitter disturbance in PD. While investigations of dopamine metabolism (as reflected by its major metabolite, homovanillic acid [HVA]) have been relatively uninformative, we found that indexing HVA concentration to that of the purine metabolite xanthine permits differentiation of PD specimens from healthy controls (p < 0.0016) [Brain Research 2011;1408:88\u201397]. In another recent biomarker study, we utilized ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography linked to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for metabolomic analysis [Movement Disorders 2011;26(Suppl 2):S193]. Using t-tests to differentiate PD and control groups at p < 0.02, we found changes in compounds not known to be related to the neurodegenerative process (4 increased in CSF concentration and 8 decreased).

The unique feature of dopaminergic neurons of the human substantia nigra pars compacta is the presence of the polymer pigment neuromelanin which gives this region its characteristic dark colour. In the healthy brain, neuromelanin appears to play a functional role to protect neurons from oxidative load but we have shown that in the Parkinson's disease brain the pigment undergoes structural changes and is associated with aggregation of \u03b1-synuclein protein, even early in the disease process. Further, the role of the pigment as a metal binder has also been suggested to underlie the relative vulnerability of these neurons, as changes in metal levels are suggested to be associated with neurodegenerative cascades in Parkinson's disease. While most research to date has focused on the role of iron in these pathways we have recently shown that changes in copper may contribute to neuronal vulnerability in this disorder.",

     "abstract": "Over the last decade, several autosomal dominant and recessive genes causative of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been identified. The functional studies on their protein products and the pathogenetic effect related to their mutations have greatly contributed to understand the many cellular pathways leading to neurodegeneration, that include oxidative stress damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, misfolded protein stress and impairment of cellular clearance systems, namely the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy pathway.Although mendelian genes are responsible only for a small subset of PD patients, it is expected that the same pathogenetic mechanisms could play a relevant role also in the more frequent sporadic PD, that is currently recognized as a multifactorial disorder. In this model, different genetic and environmental factors, either playing a protective or a susceptibility role, variably interact to reach a threshold of disease over which PD will become clinically manifest. As an example, mutations or multiplication of the alpha-synuclein gene cause autosomal dominant PD, while common genetic variants at the same locus have been consistently associated to the risk of developing PD by genome-wide association studies. These findings are opening novel interesting perspectives to identify critical molecular pathways leading to neurodegeneration.",

Of the behavioural disorders in PD, mood disorders are amongst the most common and can occur in both early and late stages of PD. In some cases, these problems may even precede the development of motor symptoms of PD. These disorders have a major impact in the quality of life and affect daily function. This review will focus on depression, anxiety and apathy, and will discuss the epidemiological, clinical features, diagnosis and management of these disorders. The diagnosis and evaluation of these problems remain a challenge in view of the overlapping symptoms between these disorders and also with the clinical features of PD. The development and validation of diagnostic criteria and rating scales for these disorders remain a priority particularly in relation to anxiety and apathy. Another gap in the management of these disorders is the limited empirical evidence for the treatment of these problems. There is therefore an urgent need for systematic studies in the pharmacological and non-pharmacological management of these disorders to enable a holistic and evidence-based approach to the management of mood disorders in PD.",

The most common ICDs reported are pathological gambling (PG), hypersexuality (HS), compulsive shopping and compulsive eating. More than a quarter of the patients with ICDs have 2 or more behavioral addictions. These abnormal behaviors impair activities of daily living and have a negative impact on quality of life of patients and their families. As with many other non motor symptoms in PD, ICDs are frequently under-reported by patients and caregivers and may be under-recognized by the treating physicians. Treatment with dopamine agonists (DA) is the main risk factor for developing ICDs, and stimulation of mesolimbic D3 receptors by DA is thought to underlie their development. The DA effect seems to be a class effect and not specific for any DA. Levodopa can also induce ICDs but much less so than the DAs. The management of ICDs in PD is complex. Modifications in dopaminergic drug treatment are frequently necessary. In some cases alternative therapies such as atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants or deep brain stimulation if motor symptoms become incapacitating after adjustment of dopamine replacement therapy should be considered.",

     "abstract": "There are a number of tremors that may affect patients with Parkinson's disease, but the classic is tremor-at-rest. The tremor is also seen during postural action after a short pause, and is often called re-emergent tremor although it appears that the physiology is the same. As a manifestation of Parkinson's disease, it is separate from bradykinesia and rigidity as the magnitude of tremor is not related to dopamine deficiency nor does it respond readily to dopamine treatment. Cellular activity in the different basal ganglia nuclei can be coherent with tremor, but cellular activity in the VIM nucleus of the thalamus, a cerebellar relay nucleus, is more coherent than cellular activity in basal ganglia. It is also notable that different body parts may have similar tremor frequencies, but are generally not exactly the same and are not phase locked. This suggests that each body part has a separate tremor generator. The ability to stay separate may be due to the somatotopic segregation of basal ganglia loops. Analysis of cellular behavior in the thalamus shows that the thalamus is not the generator of tremor. New data suggest that the basal ganglia trigger a cerebellar circuit to produce the tremor.",

The prevalence of Parkinson's disease is about 100\u2013300 per 100,000, and the majority (70\u2013100%) of these patients may develop tremor during the course of the disorder. The expression of tremor is also influenced by the genetic background of selected patients. On the other hand, Parkinson patients with a predominant tremor phenotype may have a more favourable prognosis in terms of mortality and the development of motor and non-motor complications. The diagnosis of Parkinson tremor is based on a clinical diagnosis of both underlying Parkinson's disease and on the tremor itself. Tremor is a rhythmical, involuntary oscillatory movement of a body part, and includes resting tremor, action tremor including postural and kinetic tremor. The classical type is resting tremor, but other phenotypes may also occur. Misdiagnoses between Parkinson tremor and essential tremor are relatively common. Electrophysiological and functional imaging examinations can be useful in the distinction of the two, but both approaches suffer from some limitations.

Among the hundreds of studies performed to determine the value of medical and surgical approaches on motor and non motor signs of PD, only a minority specifically considered effect on tremor as an efficacy outcome. Current available guidelines for PD treatment include attempts to specifically address tremor treatment but stress the low level of evidences available. In these conditions, with its still poorly understood pathophysiological basis and variable clinical expression PD tremor treatment is a clinical challenge. Only surgery (lesion or high frequency stimulation) of discrete deep brain targets consistently provides symptomatic long lasting alleviation.Through revision of contemporary scientific evidence, the purpose of this paper is to offer a systematic pragmatic approach to symptomatic management of tremor as one of the distinctive signs of PD that may generate substantial disability.",

Initially, PET was mostly used to assess in vivo the severity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction and the resulting motor symptomatology in PD. It has been demonstrated that PET measurements of putaminal dopaminergic function, as measured by [18F]-Fluorodopa uptake, correlate well with stages of disease and symptom severity in PD patients, particularly with bradykinesia and rigidity.Analysis of metabolic changes across the brain has identified specific brain networks associated with the main motor features of the disease, including bradykinesia and tremor.In more recent years, the growing availability of new imaging radiotracers for monoaminergic and cholinergic neurons has enabled the evaluation of the non-dopaminergic brain pathways that are likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of non motor symptoms of PD, including depression, fatigue, sleep disorders, and cognitive impairment. Finally, \u03b2-amyloid imaging agents have been used to assess the influence of coexistent cortical Alzheimer pathology in PD.

[Perception 2008;37:419\u201332] described posterior perisaccadic gamma (35\u201345 Hz) modulation associated with voluntary saccades. Voluntary impairment is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD).We have done correlational analysis of frontally and posteriorly (posterior-parietal) recorded intrasaccadic gamma (ISG) powers, to understand cortical control of voluntary saccades in PD and healthy controls.Fifteen PD patients (55\u201371 years, 4 females) and 17 healthy controls (54\u201372 years, 9 females) participated in the study. The EEG was recorded over frontal and posterior-parietal scalp sites. Saccades were recorded with electro-oculogram and infra-red ISCAN camera. Subjects executed horizontal voluntary saccades to a mark; 15 degree distance rightwards or leftwards (centrifugal CF) from the central fixation, then back to the center (centripetal CP) and so on, for 2 minutes. Perisaccadic EEG segments were wavelet transformed followed by Hilbert transform to obtain ISG (35\u201345 Hz) powers. ISG power was trial-averaged, separately for the 4 possible saccade types; CP and CF, rightwards and leftwards.The perisaccadic EEG revealed disorganization in the intrasaccadic period. The correlations between frontal and posterior ISG power are high in PD (correlation coefficient >0.6) while low in controls (correlation coefficient <0.02).We interpret these results as lack of modulatory coupling between frontal and posterior intrasaccadic mechanisms in PD. Impaired volition in PD may be due to impaired circuitry of preemptive perception (PEP). Interareal phase coupling analysis will help in investigating the cortical voluntary saccade control with greater temporal precision.",

     "abstract": "It is now recognized that the neuropathology of early Parkinson's disease (PD) is not limited to the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, but also involves various brainstem nuclei, the hypothalamus, the olfactory system, and the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Given the disseminated neuropathology of early PD, the earliest clinical signs include a myriad of non-motor manifestations including sleep-wake cycle regulation, cognition, mood and motivation, olfactory and gustatory functions, autonomic functions, and sensory and pain processing.Despite this realization, there is clearly a paucity of trials that have systematically evaluated the treatment of non-motor symptoms of PD in the early stages. For example, only one largescale, placebo-controlled randomized trial has been conducted on the treatment of depression in PD patients. There are no reports of randomized controlled trials of therapeutic agents looking at the frequently reported anxiety and fatigue in early PD patients. Based on this lack of evidence, therapy for early non-motor manifestations is often ignored and the focus remains on dopamine replacement strategies with main outcomes being restricted to motor measurements, such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. This article presents the case for prioritizing well-designed, controlled clinical trials of therapeutic interventions focusing on non-motor symptoms in early PD patients.",

Pulsatile levodopa administration likely contributes to the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia after a few years. All studies comparing levodopa versus dopamine agonist early therapy indicate that initiation with agonists is associated with a reduced risk of motor complications - in particular, dyskinesias - possibly because agonists' longer half-lives provide continuous dopaminergic delivery. Indeed, this therapeutic strategy may delay the emergence of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia which is essential to maintaining satisfactory quality of life. In advanced disease various levodopa-based strategies may be tried to control motor complications, such as dose fragmentation (smaller, more frequent dosing) or the use of orally administered, liquid levodopa formulations that may reduce off-time intervals or facilitate absorption. More recently introduced, continuous levodopa delivery by duodenal infusion (but also apomorphine infusion) may represent a more effective approach to treat motor complications in advanced PD, and its effect can be perceived by improvement both in clinical scales as well as in health-related items.

Alterations in presynaptic dopaminergic function coupled to changes in the response of post-synaptic dopaminergic receptors causing alterations in striatal output underlie attempts at compensation and the control of movement in early PD. However, eventually compensation fails and persistent changes in striatal function ensue that involve morphological, biochemical and electrophysiological change. Key alterations occur in cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission in the striatum and there are changes in motor programming controlled by events involving LTP/LTD. Dopamine replacement therapy with L-DOPA modifies altered striatal function and restores motor function but non-physiological dopamine receptor stimulation leads to altered signalling through D1 and D2 receptor systems and changes in striatal function causing abnormalities of LTP/LTD mediated through glutamatergic/nitric oxide (NO) mechanisms. These lead to the onset of dyskinesia and underlie the priming process that characterise dyskinesia and its persistence.",

     "abstract": "L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia is a major problem in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Today there are few anti-dyskinetic treatments available for the patients, and all of them have major limitations. Recent findings have revealed an important role of the serotonin system in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. In the parkinsonian brain, serotonin axon terminals can compensate for the dopamine loss by converting L-DOPA into dopamine and releasing it as a false neurotransmitter. However, the terminals represent an aberrant source of dopamine release, increasing the risk for dyskinesia. In line with this, a relatively high density of serotonin axon fibres in striatum has been reported in dyskinetic animals and patients. Furthermore, serotonin can influence dyskinesia by modulating glutamate or GABA signalling in the basal ganglia via receptors located on non-serotonergic neurons. Through either mechanism, modulation of certain serotonin receptors has been shown to reduce the severity of dyskinetic movements.The serotonin system represents an interesting target for developing anti-dyskinetic treatments. Future therapies may take advantage of the synergistic effect produced by the modulation of different serotonin receptors or pursue a region-specific modulation of certain receptors. Moreover, morphological or biochemical features of the serotonin system could be used to develop biomarkers for patient stratification in clinical trials of anti-dyskinetic compounds.",

     "abstract": "Although initially thought to be important primarily in neural development, a number of trophic proteins have been found to have neuroprotective and neuroregenerative activity in the adult central nervous system, particularly for midbrain dopamine neurons (MDN). Neurorestoration is potentially feasible for MDN since there is an initial loss of phenotype for these neurons in Parkinson's disease (PD) rather than neuronal death. There is a considerable recent literature on trophic properties of TGF-\u03b2 superfamily proteins for MDN's, including glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), neurturin, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). This paper will review studies with the factors listed above, as well as describe more recent studies with two newly described trophic proteins, MANF and CDNF. Data will be presented from various animal models of PD suggesting that these trophic proteins may eventually lead to PD therapeutics in man. In addition, some data on small molecules with neuroprotective properties (AP4A, retinoic acid and vitamin D3) will also be described.",

     "abstract": "Although a good deal is known about the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease and information is emerging about its cause, there are no pharmacological treatments shown to have a significant, sustained capacity to prevent or attenuate the condition. However, accumulating clinical evidence suggests that physical exercise can provide this much needed treatment, and studies of animal models of the dopamine deficiency associated with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease further support this hypothesis. Thus, in our collaborative research efforts, we seek to understand the biological basis for exercise-induced protection in order to assist in the development of a safe and clinically effective intervention based on increased physical activity. In addition, we recognize that some individuals cannot or will not engage in physical exercise, and believe that mechanistic studies of exercise-induced protection will provide insights into the development of drugs that could emulate its effects. Using toxins that induce a deficiency of dopamine, we have affirmed that physical exercise can reduce behavioral and neurobiological deficits induced by such toxins, and suggest that these neuroprotective effects are likely to involve the activation of signaling cascades by neurotrophic factors such as glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor.",

We examined the effect of M30 on a pre-existing lesion induced by the parkinsonism-inducing toxin, MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine). In this neurorescue/neurorestorative paradigm, M30 was orally administered to mice for 14 days (2.5\u20135 mg/kg/day) following post MPTP or lactacystin lesion and was shown to significantly elevate striatal dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline levels, reduce their metabolism, and elevate tyrosine-hydroxylase protein levels. Importantly, M30 elevated MPTP-reduced dopaminergic and transferrin receptor cell count in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). Finally, M30 was shown to decrease mitosis and elevate HIF (hypoxia induced factor) which regulates the neurotrophins BDNF, GDNF, VEGF and erythropoietin by elevating their brain levels, thus providing additional protection. These findings indicates that brain-permeable M30 has neurorestorative activity, which may clearly be of clinical importance for the treatment of PD.",

That a movement is bizarre can be helpful, but still must be considered thoughtfully since organic movement disorders can have endless variety. The diagnosis should rest on positive findings such as paroxysmal nature, maximum severity at or near onset, variability of tremor direction, frequency and amplitude, entrainment of tremor, distractability and suggestibility, and wildly swaying gait and balance problems with no falling. Psychogenic parkinsonism often poses a problem because of the relatively high frequency of overlap of psychogenic and organic disease. In regard to psychogenic parkinsonism, there are special features to look for. There might be tremor with kinetic movement as well as rest and posture, and finger tremor might be absent. With sequential movements, the sequence effect is typically lacking. Extreme slowness and grunting with great effort may be seen. Improvement in arm swing while running, a feature of organic parkinsonism, may not be seen.",

In 2011, dystonia remains a purely clinical diagnosis. Primary dystonia includes syndromes in which dystonia is the sole phenotypic manifestation with the exception that tremor can be present as well. Primary dystonias are typically mobile and may show task specificity. Fixed dystonias are often psychogenic or associated with complex regional pain syndrome. Fixed dystonia may also be the terminal consequence of long-standing, inadequately-treated, severe appendicular or cervical dystonia. The vast majority of primary dystonias have their onset in adults. Late-onset, primary, focal dystonia, particularly blepharospasm, may spread to affect other anatomical segments. Patients with focal dystonia may also exhibit spontaneous remissions that last for years. Although sensory tricks are commonly reported by patients with primary dystonia, they have also been described in subjects with secondary dystonia. Another important sensory aspect of dystonia is pain which is relatively common in cervical dystonia but also reported by many patients with masticatory dystonia, hand-forearm dystonia and blepharospasm.

Which target provides the best outcomes is unknown.The utility of GPi and STN as targets has been confirmed in numerous studies, including randomized comparisons of GPi DBS and STN DBS that demonstrated no difference in motor outcomes. DBS at either site improves appendicular motor symptoms, but beneficial effects on axial manifestations of PD such as postural instability or gait dysfunction (PIGD) are less apparent.PPN has been introduced as a DBS target due to failure of GPi and STN DBS to improve PIGD. Small observational studies indicate improved PIGD with PPN DBS, but small blinded trials show only subjective reduction in falls with no other impact on PIGD or other PD manifestations.No single DBS target is superior to the others.

     "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) targets for Parkinson's disease have been limited to neuronal regions wherein lesions have produced beneficial effects. Improvements in imaging allow placement in small and novel targets. Additionally, due to the ability of impulse generators to accommodate multiple electrodes, simultaneous stimulation in multiple neuronal regions is possible.Given that the two most disabling clinical features of Parkinson's disease, namely postural instability and dementia, have evaded effective treatment, consideration for new structural targets is warranted. Characteristics of dementia in parkinsonism include progressive deficits in attention and executive function. Additionally, many patients experience pronounced variability in cognition with profound fluctuations/variability in attention and alertness.Anecdotal and initial trial reports concerning DBS to the fornix/hypothalamus have been associated with improvement in memory function and reductions in expected cognitive decline in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. The fornix constitutes the major inflow and output pathway from the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe.I hypothesize that tandem DBS, targeting the STN/GPi and fornix/hypothalamus and/or hippocampus may have a positive impact on improving cognitive function and/or reducing risk for subsequent dementia with Lewy bodies/Parkinson dementia. Such targets also pose potential negative ramifications. Nevertheless, given the tremendous disability produced by dementia, new structural targets require systematic study.",

     "abstract": "Myoclonus is complex, and is likely to encompass a number of relatively disparate phenomena. A widely used approach to the classification of myoclonus is a physiological one, in which the major forms are cortical and subcortical. In this classification, cortical forms of myoclonus are defined by the presence of enlarged somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP), back-averaged potentials, and enhanced long latency reflexes, whereas subcortical forms are largely delineated by the absence of these features. In addition to cortical and subcortical types, the presence of generalized spike and wave discharges on EEG indicate the presence of cortical-subcortical interactions, analogous to absence seizures of idiopathic generalized epilepsy.However, a number of difficulties arise in applying these criteria to many forms of myoclonus: 1. With regard to enlarged evoked potentials, double dissociations may be found when contrasting disease entities which are known to affect cortical or subcortical structures. 2. On back-averaging, the latency of the pre-myoclonic potential may be incompatible with a primarily cortical origin for the myoclonic jerk. 3. The triad of enhanced SEP, back-averaged potential and long latency reflex may all be present or only one component may be present, suggesting different pathophysiological mechanisms underpin these phenomena.One can conclude that it is likely that many forms of myoclonus lie on a spectrum between myoclonus and tremor. Some have clearcut evidence for being of cortical origin, whereas others are cortical-subcortical or purely subcortical. The role of subcortical structures in influencing electrophysiological phenomena is poorly understood, and merits further investigation.",

Moreover, the knocked down cells displayed a lethal phenotype in differentiated cells exhibiting proteinaceous round inclusions, which were almost identical in composition to human Lewy bodies. Knock down of SKP1A rendered SN4741 cells especially sensitive to genetic reduction of the DA metabolizing enzyme, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 and exposure to external Stressors implicated in PD pathology.Future studies should contemplate intrinsic and environmental manipulations in Skp1-deficient animals to emulate the motor and non-motor disabilities, the progressive nature of PD, and striatal-nigral and adjacent areas pathology.

T-cell infiltration accompanies activated microglial and astrocytic accumulation in and around the SNpc. Although potentially beneficial, microglial activation is most likely responsible for furthering disease pathology and DA neuron degeneration through the release of harmful substances such as pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxidative species and reactive nitrogen species. Activation of the NF-\u03baB death pathway has been shown to occur following microglial activation related release of Cox-2, IL-1\u03b2, and Toll-like receptor activation, resulting in increased degeneration of DA neurons of the SNpc. Blockade of microglial activation can lead to DA neuron protection in animal models of PD; however, clinical application of anti-inflammatory drugs has not yielded similar benefits.

     "abstract": "Both epidemiological and genetic studies support a role of neuroinflammation in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, post mortem studies confirm the involvement of innate as well as adaptive immunity in the affected brain regions in patients with PD. Indeed, activated microglial cells and T lymphocytes have been detected in the substantia nigra of patients concomitantly with an increased expression of pro-inflammatory mediators. Preclinical investigations conducted in various animal models of PD indicate that inflammatory processes are instrumental in neuronal cell death even though they are unlikely to be a primary cause for neuronal loss. Neuroinflammatory processes in PD are rather involved in self-perpetuating deleterious events that lead to protracted neuronal degeneration. In line with this, recent data indicate that glucocorticoid receptors are important in curtailing microglial reactivity, and deregulation in their activity in PD could lead to sustained inflammation-mediated degeneration. Altogether, neuroinflammatory processes might represent a target for neuroprotection in PD.",

     "abstract": "Neuroinflammation is closely associated with the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and other neurological disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that inhibition of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation might represent a promising therapeutic potential for PD and related disorders. Fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, is commonly used for the treatment of major depression due to its tolerability and safety profiles. Recent studies have shown that fluoxetine affords robust neuroprotection in a series of neurological disease models. However, the mechanism underlying fluoxetine-mediated neuroprotection remains unclear. Here, by using rat primary midbrain neuronglia cultures, we report that both R and S enantiomers of fluoxetine attenuated chronic neurodegeneration induced by a common inflammogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and a neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). Reconstituted cell culture studies further revealed that microglia were required for fluoxetine-mediated neuroprotection. Fluoxetine significantly inhibited LPS-induced activation of microglia and subsequent release of multiple pro-inflammatory and cytotoxic factors including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, inhibition of microglial NF-\u03baB signaling pathway participated in fluoxetine-mediated neuroprotection. Collectively, fluoxetine exerted neuroprotection against microglia-mediated neurotoxicity. Thus, fluoxetine might hold a potential to retard inflammation-mediated chronic neurodegenerative process of PD.",

Over the past decade, immunization strategies were developed in our laboratories to combat disease progression. These strategies were developed in laboratory and animal models of human disease. Induction of humoral immune responses can be elicited against misfolded protein aggregates. Robust cell-mediated immunity against nitrated misfolded protein(s) accelerates disease progression through effector T cell responses that facilitate neuronal death. We propose that shifting the balance between effector and regulatory T cell activity can attenuate neurotoxic inflammatory events. We now summarize our works that support immune regulation in PD with the singular goal of restoring homeostatic glial responses. New methods to optimize immunization schemes and measure their clinical efficacy are discussed.",

In addition, we searched PubMed and the China Hospital Knowledge Database for epidemiological studies of pain and fatigue among PD patients from 1999 to 2011 to understand the prevalence of these symptoms around the world and associated clinical features. The 901 PD cases were recruited from 42 university affiliated hospitals randomly selected from seven provincial capitals across four economic regions of China. We documented motor and non-motor symptoms via clinical examinations and questionnaire surveys. Using logistic regression models, we evaluated factors that were associated with PD pain among these Chinese patients. Of the 901 Chinese patients, 269 (29.9%) had PD-related pain. After adjusting for confounders, only dyskinesias (OR = 2.66) and depression (OR = 2.88) were independently associated with PD pain. The literature search identified a total of 16 eligible studies on PD-pain and 19 on PD fatigue with various tools for symptom assessment. The data suggest a crude prevalence of 33.7% for PD pain in Asia and 79.4% in Northern Europe; the prevalence for PD fatigue was 35.4% in Northern Europe and 59.1% in Western Europe. Interestingly, Northern-European PD patients reported the highest prevalence of pain, but the lowest prevalence of fatigue. These studies suggest that motor complications and depression are likely key predictors for PD pain, while disease severity, depression and sleep disturbance are associated with PD fatigue. More studies with standardized methods would be needed to better understand the prevalence of PD pain and fatigue across various regions of the world.",

     "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease (PD), nigral degeneration determines an altered neuronal ouput from the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus, and as a consequence functional changes in the motor circuits linking basal ganglia to the motor cortical areas. Movement slowness, rigidity and tremor are among the principal motor symptoms of PD. Studies of movement execution have shown that PD patients have difficulty in performing simultaneous and sequential movements. In executing sequential movements the abnormalities of PD patients worsen as the sequence progresses. This phenomenon, called sequential effect, may be one of the mechanisms underlying the fatigue of PD patients. Cortical deafferentation is thought to be responsible for the motor disturbances of PD and studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation showed that in PD patients there are abnormalities in cortical plasticity and in cortical connectivity. Sensorimotor integration refers to the processes that link sensory input to motor output to produce appropriate voluntary movements. Sensory information is important for motor preparation and execution in parkinsonian patients, and PD patients have greater difficulty in performing movements when no external cues are provided. Investigating the role of sensory information, several studies provided evidence that PD patients have numerous somatosensory deficits, including tactile temporal discrimination threshold. Neurophysiological testing in PD has also found altered central somatosensory processing. Finally PD patients may experience painful sensations after the onset of the disease and various evidence suggests an abnormal nociceptive input processing in the central nervous system that might predispose PD patients to developing pain.",

We found a female predominance (2.4:1 and 1.9:1 for primary and secondary dystonia, respectively). The cervical region was most commonly affected in primary dystonia and the limbs in secondary cases.

The most common lesions were strokes involving the corticospinal pathway. All of those patients exhibited limb dystonia, except one with cervical dystonia following a thalamic infarct. In conclusion, primary and secondary dystonias are more prevalent in women, suggesting a sex-related predisposition to the development of this movement disorder.

In healthy people, co-speech gestures can add significant meaning and emphasis to speech. There is, however, little research into how this important channel of communication is affected in PD.The present study provides a systematic analysis of co-speech gestures which spontaneously accompany the description of actions in a group of PD patients (N\u00a0=\u00a023, Hoehn and Yahr Stage III or less) and age-matched healthy controls (N\u00a0=\u00a022). The analysis considers different co-speech gesture types, using established classification schemes from the field of gesture research. The analysis focuses on the rate of these gestures as well as on their qualitative nature. In doing so, the analysis attempts to overcome several methodological shortcomings of research in this area.Contrary to expectation, gesture rate was not significantly affected in our patient group, with relatively mild PD. This indicates that co-speech gestures could compensate for speech problems. However, while gesture rate seems unaffected, the qualitative precision of gestures representing actions was significantly reduced.This study demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out fine-grained, detailed analyses of gestures in PD and offers insights into an as yet neglected facet of communication in patients with PD. Based on the present findings, an important next step is the closer investigation of the qualitative changes in gesture (including different communicative situations) and an analysis of the heterogeneity in co-speech gesture production in PD.",

There were no serious adverse events. One subject withdrew due to worsening of tremor and dystonia. The most commonly reported adverse events were vaginal spotting, breast enlargement and breast tenderness.

In Mexico and Brazil SCA10 represents the second most common type of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia. The phenotype described in Mexico, is characterized by the association of cerebellar ataxia with epilepsy, while in Brazil the SCA10 phenotype is that of a pure cerebellar ataxia. As yet unidentified genotypic variables may account for this phenotypic difference.",

However, it remains unclear whether levodopa affects GIT function in PD.To perform an open study of levodopa\u2019s effects on anorectal constipation in de novo PD patients by the quantitative lower-gastrointestinal autonomic test (QL-GAT).Nineteen unselected de novo PD patients (10 men, 9 women; mean age, 66 years; mean duration of the disease, 2.2 years) were recruited for the study. Eighteen of the patients reported constipation. These patients were treated with 200/20\u00a0mg b.i.d. of levodopa/carbidopa for 3 months. Pre- and post-treatment, objective parameters in the QL-GAT that comprised the colonic transit time (CTT) and rectoanal videomanometry were obtained.Levodopa was well tolerated by all patients. There was a trend toward subjective improvements in bowel frequency and difficulty defecating. Levodopa did not significantly change CTT of the total colon or any segment of the colon. During rectal filling, levodopa significantly lessened the first sensation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). It also tended to augment the amplitude of spontaneous phasic rectal contraction (not statistically significant). During defecation, levodopa significantly lessened the amplitude in paradoxical sphincter contraction upon defecation (PSD) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). It also tended to augment the amplitude of rectal contraction and lessen the amplitude of abdominal strain (not statistically significant). Overall, levodopa significantly lessened post-defecation residuals (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The QL-GAT in the present study showed for the first time that levodopa augmented rectal contraction, lessened PSD, and thereby ameliorated anorectal constipation in de novo PD patients.",

Evidence for activated glia involvement in PSP has raised the possibility that neuroinflammation may contribute to its pathogenesis. To investigate the correlation between neuroinflammation and PSP, a comparative study was conducted on the patterns of cytokine expression in different regions of the brains of PSP, Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) patients and normal controls. Our results show different patterns of cytokine expression in each disease, with the expression of IL-1\u03b2 transcripts being significantly higher in the substantia nigra of PSP than in AD and controls, while AD brains had significantly higher IL-1\u03b2 expression in the parietal cortex compared to PSP and controls. In addition, expression of TGF\u03b2 was significantly higher in the cortical areas (particularly frontal and parietal lobes) of AD compared to PSP and controls. These results show a disease-specific topographical relationship among the expression of certain cytokines (IL-1\u03b2 and TGF\u03b2), microglial activation and neurodegenerative changes, suggesting that these cytokines may contribute to the pathologic process. If so, the use of cytokine-inhibitors and/or other anti-inflammatory agents may be able to slow disease progression in PSP.",

Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1), a DNA-binding enzyme and transcriptional regulator, plays an important role in modulating the cellular response to oxidative stress, inflammatory stimuli, and in apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of PARP1 results in significant neuroprotection in PD animal models; moreover PARP1 has a physiological role in the regulation of alpha-synuclein expression. A previous study had demonstrated that variants located within the PARP1 gene promoter reduce the risk of PD and delay the disease age at onset. In light of these data, we carried out an association study to investigate whether variability within this gene is associated with PD risk and disease age at onset in an Italian cohort composed of 600 PD patients and 592 healthy controls. To this purpose, we used a comprehensive tag SNP approach spanning the entire gene and the upstream and downstream regions. We did not detect any significant association of the PARP1 gene with PD either at genotypic or haplotypic level; none of the 11 genotyped SNPs was significantly associated with PD age at onset. We conclude that, despite previous evidence, PARP1 is not a susceptibility gene for PD in our population.",

Empirical findings support the value of the concept of MCI in this population, from the early untreated stages onwards. Further studies are needed to establish 1) the clinical-neuroimaging characteristics of MCI subtypes in PD, in comparison to those MCI subtypes in patients without PD; 2) whether different types of MCI in PD are associated with different rates of cognitive decline during the progression of the disease. Preliminary empirical evidence also shows that education might exert a protective effect on cognitive decline in PD and that less educated subjects are at increased risk for developing dementia, lending support to the CR hypothesis, in this population as well. Further studies are necessary to investigate how CR modulates cognitive decline in PD and other frontal-subcortical disorders, e.g. by identifying possible differential effects of CR on different cognitive domains.",

     "abstract": "In contrast to our vast knowledge of the dopamine (DA) system, much less is known about the involvement of serotonin (5-HT) in neurodegenerative diseases affecting the basal ganglia. Therefore, we designed a study that aimed at characterizing the status of the striatal DA and 5-HT systems in patients who suffered from either Parkinson\u2019s (PD) or Huntington\u2019s disease (HD), compared to age-matched controls. Antibodies against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and 5-HT transporter (SERT) were used as markers of DA and 5-HT axonal profiles, respectively. The density and pattern of TH+ and SERT\u00a0+\u00a0innervation were determined by optical density measurements as well as by direct stereological estimates of labeled axon varicosities. The results reveal a significant decrease in TH immunoreactivity and TH\u00a0+\u00a0axon terminals throughout the striatum in both PD and HD, whereas the intensity of SERT immunostaining and the density of SERT\u00a0+\u00a0axon varicosities were found to be slightly increased in the striatum of PD and HD patients compared to controls. These findings reveal that the nigrostriatal DA system is significantly impaired in both PD and HD compared to the striatal 5-HT innervation, which is slightly increased in these two conditions. The striatal 5-HT augmentation observed in PD might be the result of a neural mechanism designed to compensate for DA denervation, whereas the marked atrophy of the striatum might explain the increase in the 5-HT innervation noted in HD. These findings underline the importance of the complex interplay between DA and 5-HT striatal afferents in the elaboration of appropriate motor behaviour.",

Eighteen probable PSP subjects and 18 controls had resting-state (task-free) fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging and structural MRI. Functional connectivity was assessed between thalamus and the rest of the brain, and within the basal ganglia, salience and default mode networks (DMN). Patterns of atrophy were assessed using voxel-based morphometry, and patterns of white matter tract degeneration were assessed using tract-based spatial statistics. Reduced in-phase functional connectivity was observed between the thalamus and premotor cortex including supplemental motor area (SMA), striatum, thalamus and cerebellum in PSP. Reduced connectivity in premotor cortex, striatum and thalamus were observed in the basal ganglia network and DMN, with subcortical salience network reductions. Tract degeneration was observed between cerebellum and thalamus and in superior longitudinal fasciculus, with grey matter loss in frontal lobe, premotor cortex, SMA and caudate nucleus. SMA functional connectivity correlated with SMA volume and measures of cognitive and motor dysfunction, while thalamic connectivity correlated with degeneration of superior cerebellar peduncles. PSP is therefore associated with disrupted thalamocortical connectivity that is associated with degeneration of the dentatorubrothalamic tract and the presence of cortical atrophy.",

The nucleus ventralis intermedius thalami (Vim) is the target of choice, but promising results have been presented regarding DBS in the posterior subthalamic area (PSA). The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible influence of gender, age and severity of disease on the outcome of these procedures.Sixty eight patients (34 Vim, 34 PSA) with ET were included in this non-randomised study. Evaluation using the Essential Tremor Rating Scale (ETRS) was performed before, and one year after surgery concerning PSA DBS, and at a mean of 28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a024 months concerning Vim DBS. Items 5/6 and 11\u201314 (hand tremor and hand function) were selected for analysis of tremor outcome.The efficacy of DBS on essential tremor was not related to age or gender. Nor was it associated with the severity of tremor when the percentual reduction of tremor on stimulation was taken into account. However, patients with a more severe tremor at baseline had a higher degree of residual tremor on stimulation. Tremor in the treated hand and hand function were improved with 70% in the Vim group and 89% in the PSA group.",

A variety of standardized motor, cognitive, psychiatric, and global severity measures were administered. A multivariate logistic regression model was built to determine the variables producing discrepancy between the MDS-TF and DSM-IV criteria for PDD and the clinical features that distinguished false negative cases.Agreement between MDS-TF and DSM-IV criteria was substantial (87.3%; kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.72), but the DSM-IV criteria failed to identify 22% of patients fulfilling MDS-TF criteria. False negative cases were older and had more severe motor symptoms but less psychosis than those true non-demented PD. False positives had less severe motor symptoms than true PDD, although the difference did not reach statistical significance.Our findings suggest that the MDS-TF criteria are more sensitive than the DSM-IV for a diagnosis of PDD. Old age, absence of psychiatric symptoms, and severe motor impairment can hinder the diagnosis of PDD.",

We aimed to determine the prevalence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension (OH) in patients with PD and atypical parkinsonism, and to evaluate the risk factors for OH in this population. We reviewed the records of 1318 patients diagnosed with PD or atypical parkinsonism at the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Center and Movement Disorders Clinic, Baylor College of Medicine. The frequency of symptomatic OH was 81% (21/26) in patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 18% (198/1125) of PD patients, and 19% (31/167) of patients with non-MSA atypical parkinsonism. Among PD patients, those with symptoms of OH were significantly older (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), had more advanced Hoehn & Yahr stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), a longer duration of PD symptoms (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031), and a greater range between their highest and lowest sitting systolic and diastolic BPs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) over time. In the atypical parkinsonism group, excluding MSA, patients with symptoms of OH were taking more anti-hypertensive medications than those without symptoms of OH (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043). On the other hand, MSA patients with symptoms of OH were less likely to be taking anti-hypertensive medications than those without symptoms (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035).

The first genome-wide association study in ET showed a significant association with the rs9652490 SNP of the leucine-rich repeat and Ig domain containing 1 (LINGO1) gene. Since patients with PD have higher LINGO1 expression levels compared to healthy controls, and animal models of PD show elevated LINGO1 protein levels after experimentally induced damage in the striatum, it can be inferred that LINGO1 is probably involved in PD pathophysiology.In this study, we performed a genetic association analysis of the rs9652490 and rs11856808 SNPs in Italian PD patients and controls to assess the role of these variants in our population. A total of 567 patients with PD and 468 control subjects were enrolled in five Movement Disorder centers located in Central-Southern Italy. Both variants were significantly associated with PD under a recessive model of inheritance before applying the Bonferroni correction. The GG genotype of rs9652490 and the TT genotype of rs11856808 were less frequent in patients than in controls, suggesting a protective effect against the disease. However, after stringent correction, only the P-values obtained from allele and genotype comparisons of the rs11856808 SNP remained significant. Our findings suggest that LINGO1 plays a certain role in the development of PD in the Italian population and represents an interesting candidate gene responsible for PD, due to its involvement in neurological processes.",

We previously showed that in a choice-reaction time and a predictable timed-response task, normal subjects perform reaching movements to the same targets with two different kinematic patterns, a marker of flexibility. Here, we used the two tasks to determine whether basal ganglia are involved in the selection and modulation of movement kinematics and therefore in flexible force production.We tested seventeen patients in the early stages of Parkinson\u2019s disease, eleven pre-symptomatic Huntington\u2019s disease carriers and sixteen age-matched normal controls with the above-mentioned motor tasks.In both patient groups, the difference in kinematics (movement duration, peak velocity and acceleration) between the two tasks was significantly reduced compared to controls, indicating a limited range of choices or flexibility. However, this reduction was skewed in opposite directions in the two disorders, with force production being generally higher in Huntington\u2019s carriers and lower in Parkinson\u2019s patients compared to controls.We conclude that basal ganglia are involved in adapting movement to different contexts and selecting the appropriate movement force. The opposite trends in Parkinson\u2019s and Huntington\u2019s disease suggest that such regulation might depend on the balance between the outputs of direct and indirect pathways.",

The discovery of at least six PD-causing genes in predominantly early-onset forms of the disorder has cemented a genetic component to the etiology. Notably, the discovery of mutations in the LRRK2 gene in patients presenting with typical \u2018sporadic\u2019 PD with ages at onset in their sixties and seventies has shifted paradigms in the field of PD research. The G2019S mutation in LRRK2 has been found in diverse populations worldwide and usually resides on a common haplotype revealing that many of these individuals share a common ancestor, probably of Middle Eastern origin. The only validated coding susceptibility alleles for PD, G2385R and R1628P, are both in this gene but to date have been found exclusively in Asian populations. Concomitant with genetic testing for PD is the need for appropriate and informed genetic counseling. Families of patients with LRRK2 mutations and susceptibility alleles need to be informed about the current lack of disease preventative strategies and the implications surrounding incomplete penetrance. In summary, single-handedly LRRK2 has had a major impact on the field of PD research and the findings have been of interest to both clinicians and scientists. We anticipate that other genes of such major impact exist for PD and look forward to their discovery.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, studies of essential tremor (ET) have demonstrated that the disease is associated with functionally-relevant cognitive abnormalities, a mood disturbance and other psychiatric co-morbidities, a functionally significant gait disorder, hearing deficits, and a variety of types of tremor. The tremor has been shown to be progressive in nature and quite disabling for a large number of sufferers. Also, recent clinical\u2013epidemiological studies have linked prevalent ET to other neurodegenerative diseases and at least one study has demonstrated an increased risk of mortality in an ET cohort. While many of these studies are derived from clinic-based samples, population-based studies have also substantiated these findings, suggesting that even in the general population, the disease is associated with disability and with co-morbidity. Based on these available studies, it would seem inaccurate to append the word \u201cbenign\u201d to ET. Not unlike the word \u201cessential\u201d itself, the word \u201cbenign\u201d is an antiquated and outdated term that reflects an era where little was understood about ET. Historically, the general doctors who frequently encountered the disorder would educate patients that it was a benign, non-progressive condition not associated with any co-morbidity or risk of long-term worry. This notion, conceived by prior generations of physicians, is now known to be inaccurate. It is therefore our recommendation that the medical community open the dialog to consider formally discontinuing this nosology (\u201cbenign essential tremor\u201d) and to adopt the use of the term \u201cessential tremor.\u201d Use of the word \u201cbenign\u201d is a mischaracterization of the disease course, and could be prove misleading especially in the evolving doctor\u2013patient relationship. In those cases with currently-mild tremor, the nosology \u201cmild essential tremor\u201d would be a more accurate reflection of disease.",

In SCA1, the severity of ataxia strongly correlated with the degree of gray matter atrophy in cerebellar hemispheres.

Four movement disorder specialists independently rated video segments of the standardized tasks but not the ADL tasks. Quantitative features were extracted from the motion sensors and used to develop mathematical models for predicting rating scores from kinematic data.The quantitative motion features were highly correlated with wTRS ratings for postural (r\u00a0=\u00a00.90) and kinetic (r\u00a0=\u00a00.80) tremors. Mathematical models produced tremor ratings that correlated strongly with clinician ratings of the wTRS tasks (mean r\u00a0=\u00a00.80) and also produced ADL task ratings that correlated well with the most recent clinician wTRS ratings (mean r\u00a0=\u00a00.72).Recordings from motion sensors can be used to classify tremor as postural or kinetic and quantify tremor severity during both standardized and non-standardized activities.",

There were no accompanying motor or cognitive signs. In this kindred, age of onset ranged from 45 to 50 years and onset was frequently sudden, with symptoms developing within weeks or months. DYT1 was excluded as the cause of dystonia in this kindred. The entire genomic region of THAP1, including non-coding regions, was sequenced. We identified 13 sequence variants in THAP1, although none co-segregated with dystonia. A novel THAP1 variant (c.-237-3G>T/A) was found in 3/84 AA dystonia patient alleles and 3/212 AA control alleles, but not in 5870 Caucasian alleles. In summary, although previously unreported, familial primary dystonia does occur in African\u2013Americans. Genetic analysis of the entire genomic region of THAP1 revealed a novel variant that was specific for African\u2013Americans. Therefore, genetic testing for dystonia and future studies of candidate genes must take genetic background into consideration.",

     "abstract": "Wilson disease patients present with any of several neurologic phenotypes, and their treated outcomes vary widely. Our goal was to determine whether presenting clinical features of neurologic Wilson disease (WD) predict longer term neurologic outcomes in patients receiving anticopper treatment.Patients enrolled in four WD treatment trials received a standardized neurologic examination at trial enrollment and then at pre-specified intervals following anticopper therapy, initially with tetrathiomolybdate or trientine and then with zinc. The examination scored patients\u2019 motor signs, including tremor, rigidity, dystonia, dyarthria, and gait. The Total Score was obtained by summing these subscores.Eighty-six patients were included in our analysis, with a mean follow-up of 34.7 months. Retrospectively, the analysis compared scaled and unscaled sign subscores at enrollment and follow-up with change in the Total Score, using a generalized estimating equations approach.In the primary analysis, improvement in the Total Score was best predicted by sign subscores for tremor (beta\u00a0\u22120.7, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), gait abnormalities (beta\u00a0\u22123.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and speech (beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Dystonia (beta\u00a0=\u00a01.8, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and facial expression (beta\u00a0=\u00a01.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) were associated with worsening Total Score. Of the motor signs followed individually, dystonia proved most resistant to treatment.This is the first large-scale prospectively acquired study assessing prognostic significance of specific neurologic signs in WD. Our data support the historical observations that tremor is a favorable prognostic sign while dystonia is relatively refractory to treatment in WD.",

Although not clinically apparent, we hypothesized that spontaneous sway in quiet stance is abnormal in people with untreated PD.We examined 13 subjects, recently diagnosed with PD, who were not yet taking any anti-parkinsonian medications and 12 healthy, age-matched control subjects. Postural sway was measured with a linear accelerometer on the posterior trunk (L5 level) and compared with traditional force plate measures of sway. Subjects stood for 2\u00a0min under two conditions: eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC).One of the most discriminative measures of postural changes in subjects with untreated PD was the increased \u2018JERK\u2019 of lower trunk in the EO condition, measured with the accelerometer. Root mean square and the frequency dispersion of postural sway in the EO condition also discriminated sway in untreated PD subjects compared to control subjects.We conclude that accelerometer-based sway metrics could be used as objective measures of postural instability in untreated PD. Accelerometer-based analysis of spontaneous sway may provide a powerful tool for early clinical trials and for monitoring the effects of treatment of balance disorders in subjects with PD.",

     "abstract": "This paper began as a letter to the editor, commenting on several methodological and conceptual problems with the paper by Rajput et\u00a0al. [1]. We were asked by the editors to expand the paper to include a more general discussion of the role of the cerebellum in essential tremor (ET). The study of the neuropathological underpinnings of essential tremor (ET) is a relatively new undertaking. The purpose of this paper is three-fold. The first is to comment on methodological problems in a recently-published paper by Rajput et\u00a0al., the major one being the small sample size of that study, which resulted in a Type II statistical error. Hence, one cannot conclude based on their data that there is no Purkinje cell (PC) loss in ET. Secondly, we comment on conceptual problems with that study, which suggested that PC loss might not be a featured characteristic of ET because it is also found in other disease states. We discuss why this is an erroneous conclusion. Our third purpose is to more broadly discuss the role of the cerebellum in ET, giving consideration to the wealth of clinical and postmortem data that have accumulated over recent years. In this discussion, we make the following points: (1) it is now generally recognized that ET is a disease of cerebellar systems dysfunction, (2) given the nature of the postmortem work, revealing the presence of several types of structural-anatomical changes within the cerebellum and absence of detectable changes in other brain regions, the most empirically-based explanation is that the primary problem in ET is in the cerebellum itself, (3) that the collection of cellular changes in the cerebellum in ET are also present in other cerebellar degenerations should add to rather than detract from the notion that ET is a disease of cerebellar degeneration.",

Cerebellar PC counts were done in all cases by a neuropathologist using three different methods to identify PC.There were individual differences in PC counts in all subgroups. There was no difference between ET and controls of the same age. The PC count in ET was not related to: onset site of ET, severity of symptoms, or any other clinical features that we studied but there was a trend to a reduced number of PC with age in all groups.There is no evidence in our study or in the literature to date indicating that PC loss is the pathological basis of ET.

Especially the impulse control disorders (ICD) such as pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive eating and buying may have dramatic repercussions on family, personal and professional life. Drug replacement therapy (DRT) is believed to play an important role in the onset of these behavioral disturbances. Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) might be a therapeutic option for those patients with DRT-related behavior, it may also induce ICD. So far, little is known about the relationship between STN DBS and impulse control and related disorders. Our aim was to review the current knowledge on this relationship in PD patients. The available studies showed that stimulation of the STN is associated with both favorable and negative outcome in terms of impulse control and related disorders. Preoperative disorders may resolve or improve after STN DBS, but these can also worsen or show no change at all. Moreover, STN DBS can also reveal or even induce ICD. Possible explanations for this variability are proposed and suggestions for clinical management are given.",

Iron may only cause oxidative stress injury when it is available as labile iron for Fenton reaction. This may be related to the decreased ability of ferritin to retain iron within the iron core of ferritin. This happens in PD and in neuroferritinopathy. In PD there is a decrease in the concentration of L ferritin, while in neuroferritinopathy there is a genetically induced mutation in L ferritin causing its loss of function. We discuss the importance of the ratio H/L ferritin and its changes in neurodegeneration.",

Optical coherence tomography can examine retinal structure non-invasively and retinal thinning has been suggested as a potential biomarker for neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Our aim was to examine the retinal thickness of a cohort of Parkinson's disease subjects (and age-matched controls) to establish the practical utility of optical coherence tomography in a representative older Parkinson's disease group.Fifty-one established Parkinson's disease subjects and 25 healthy controls were subjected to ophthalmological assessment and optical coherence tomography (Zeiss Stratus 3000\u2122) of macular thickness and volume and retinal nerve fibre thickness around the optic nerve head. Twenty four percent of control and 20% of Parkinson's disease subjects were excluded from final analysis due to co-morbid ocular pathology. Further data was excluded either due to poor tolerability of optical coherence tomography or poor quality scans.Despite a reduction in both visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in the residual evaluable Parkinson's disease cohort, we did not detect any differences between the two study groups for any measures of retinal thickness, in contrast to previously published work.In addition to technical problems inherent in the evaluation, the lack of difference between Parkinson's disease and healthy control subjects suggests longitudinal studies, employing newer techniques, will be required to define the role of optical coherence tomography as a potential diagnostic biomarker.",

Primary concerns were adherence to the outpatient medication schedule and poor understanding by hospital staff of medications that worsen PD. Few Centers had a policy with their primary hospital that notified them when their patients were admitted. Rather, notification of hospitalization came often from the patient or a family member. Several Centers (29%) reported not finding out about a hospitalization until a routine clinic visit after discharge. Quick access to outpatient PD care following discharge was a problem in many Centers. Elective surgery, fall/fracture, infection, and mental status changes, were identified as common reasons for hospitalization.There is a perceived need for PD specialists to be involved during hospitalization of their patients. Improvement in communication between hospitals and PD Centers is necessary so that hospital clinicians can take advantage of PD specialists\u2019 expertise. Education of hospital staff and clinicians regarding management of PD, complications of PD, and medications to avoid in PD is critical. Most importantly, outpatient access to PD specialists needs to be improved, which may prevent unnecessary hospitalizations in these patients.",

Self reports, secondary records of physician diagnosis and drug tracer methods each exhibit known disadvantages but have rarely been compared directly. Prescriptions of levodopa have in some studies been considered to comprise a reasonable proxy for Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnosis. We tested this assumption by comparing three methods of population-level case ascertainment.We compared the number of Parkinson\u2019s disease cases in British Columbia derived from self-reports in the 2001 Canadian Community Health Survey to those obtained from administrative records of filled levodopa prescriptions and to Parkinson\u2019s disease diagnoses from physician visit billing and hospital discharge records in 1996 and 2005. We directly compared a case definition based on levodopa prescriptions with a definition based on records of physician diagnosis by calculating positive predictive value and sensitivity.Crude prevalence estimates ranged from approximately 100 to 200 per 100,000. Levodopa-based case definitions overestimated prevalence, while physician- and hospital-record-based case definitions provided lower prevalence estimates compared to survey derived estimates. The proportion of levodopa users with a diagnosis of Parkinson\u2019s disease declined from 62% to 52% between 1996 and 2005. This decrease was most dramatic among women (64%\u201344%) and those under age 65 (54%\u201339%).Sex and age trends suggest increasing use of levodopa among patients with conditions other than Parkinson\u2019s disease, such as restless legs syndrome.

     "abstract": "When reaching movements are performed in an unusual area of work, normal subjects produce a rightward directional error. This has been considered to be caused by an impaired representation of limb configuration, which hampers the actual movement vector. Motor programming has been found to be impaired in dystonia. To understand how patients affected by idiopathic cervical dystonia (CD) perform reaching movements in an unusual area of work, we investigated 10 CD patients and 10 age-matched controls. Reaching movements on a digitized tablet were recorded both with the right arm aligned to the midline (central position) and shifted to the right (lateral position), but hidden from view. While differences in the main kinematic parameters were not affected by the position both in patients and controls, the directional error was significantly increased in dystonic patients for the lateral position. We hypothesise that an impaired integration of proprioceptive information with the motor output and egocentric spatial perception could be responsible for a greater error in spatial representation of hand location and consequently to an increased directional error in dystonic patients.",

Although deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery is a safe and highly effective treatment, it may be under-utilized. We are unaware of studies that assess ET patients\u2019 attitudes toward DBS surgery and the factors that motivate them toward or away from such surgery.ET cases, enrolled in an ongoing clinical\u2013pathological study, underwent an in-person evaluation. They were asked \u201cWhat is the likelihood that you would allow yourself to have DBS surgery?\u201d, thus rating their \u2018surgical receptivity\u2019 from 0 to 100.One-third (47/146, 32.2%) of ET cases reported that they would consider DBS surgery.

Interestingly, psychosocial variables (dysthymia, depressive symptoms, self-reported embarrassment) featured prominently among these factors; indeed, self-reported embarrassment was the most robust factor. Tremor severity, though associated in univariate analyses with increased surgical receptivity, was not as robust of a predictor as was self-reported embarrassment.

     "abstract": "There is an ongoing debate about generic drug use for a multitude of conditions including epilepsy, psychosis, hypertension, post-organ transplantation, and several infectious diseases. Most of the concerns involve drugs with narrow therapeutic indices. There is a heightened attention to health care costs and macroeconomic policy as well as microeconomic business decisions that may impact the use of generic drugs. The issues surrounding generic substitution for chronic degenerative conditions such as in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) continue to be controversial subjects for physicians, pharmacists, patients, Medicare/governmental insurance programs, and for private insurance companies. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires that generic drugs meet a standard for bioequivalence prior to market approval, but this may not translate to therapeutic efficacy or to overall patient tolerance. In this review we will address issues related to the use of generics versus branded drugs in PD, and the potential impact substitution of generics may have on patients and on clinicians. Having proper documentation may help in deciding the appropriate usage of these drugs in PD. Medicare, governmental run health care systems, and third party insurance companies should in a complex disease such as PD, allow physicians and patients the chance to properly document the superiority of brand versus generic approaches. Currently, in the U.S, and in many countries around the world, there is no obligation for payers to respect these types of patient specific bedside trials, and there has been no standardization of the process.",

Data were extracted for neurobehavioural outcome, for study design and for the reporting of measures to avoid bias. Standardised mean difference meta-analysis was used to provide summary estimates of efficacy, with the effects of study quality and study design explored using stratified meta-analysis.253 publications reported the use of a dopamine agonist in an animal model of PD; of these 121 reported data suitable for inclusion in meta-analysis. 47 interventions were tested in 601 experiments using 4181 animals. Overall, neurobehavioural outcome was improved by 1.08 standard deviations (SD; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.97\u20131.19). Reporting of measures to reduce bias was low and publications which reported the blinded assessment of outcome had significantly smaller effect sizes (0.85, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.07) than those which did not (1.18, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.31, p\u00a0<\u00a00.005).While dopamine agonists do appear to have efficacy in animal models of PD the low prevalence of reporting of measures to avoid bias is of concern.

We assessed the cognitive outcomes of 19 STN-DBS patients compared to a group of 18 medically-managed PD patients on a comprehensive neuropsychological battery at baseline and two years post-surgery. Patients did not demonstrate changes in global cognitive functioning on screening measures. However, neuropsychological results revealed impairments in nonverbal recall, oral information processing speed, and lexical and semantic fluency in STN-DBS patients compared to PD controls 2 years post-surgery in these preliminary analyses. Additionally, reliable change indices revealed that approximately 50% of STN-DBS patients demonstrated significant declines in nonverbal memory and oral information processing speed compared to 25\u201330% of PD controls, and 26% of STN-DBS patients declined on lexical fluency compared to 11% of PD patients. Approximately 30% of both groups declined on semantic fluency.

The mean Gallyas-positive PSP features grading for subjects with possible incidental neuropathological PSP was compared to those of subjects with clinically manifest disease.There were 5 cases with histopathological findings suggestive of PSP, but no parkinsonism, dementia or movement disorder during life. Cognitive evaluation revealed 4 of the 5 cases to be cognitively normal; one case had amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in her last year of life. The mean age at death of the 5 cases was 88.9 years (range 80\u201394). All 5 individuals had histopathologic microscopic findings suggestive of PSP. Mean Gallyas-positive PSP features grading was significantly lower in subjects with possible incidental neuropathological PSP than subjects with clinical PSP, particularly in the subthalamic nucleus.We present 5 patients with histopathological findings suggestive of PSP, without clinical PSP, dementia or parkinsonism during life. These incidental neuropathological PSP findings may represent the early or pre-symptomatic stage of PSP. The mean Gallyas-positive PSP features grading was significantly lower in possible incidental PSP than in clinical PSP, thus suggesting that a threshold of pathological burden needs to be reached within the typically affected areas in PSP before clinical signs and symptoms appear.",

     "abstract": "A role for the immune system in the pathogenesis of Parkinson\u2019s Disease (PD) has previously been suggested. A recent genome-wide association (GWA) study identified an association between one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) region (HLA-DRA rs3129882) and PD in a population of American patients with European ancestry. In that study, the minor rs3129882 allele (G) was associated with an increased risk of PD under an additive model. Due to the increased likelihood of obtaining false positive results in GWA studies compared to studies conducted based on a hypothesis-driven approach, repeated validation of findings from GWA studies are necessary. Herein, we evaluated the association between rs3129882 and PD in three different Caucasian patient-control series (combined 1313 patients and 1305 controls) from the US, Ireland, and Poland. We observed no association (OR: 0.96, P\u00a0=\u00a00.50) between rs3129882 and PD when analyzing our data under an additive or dominant model. In contrast, when examined under a recessive model, the GG genotype was observed to be protective in the Irish (OR: 0.55, P\u00a0=\u00a00.008), Polish (OR: 0.67, P\u00a0=\u00a00.040) and combined (OR: 0.75, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) patient-control series. In view of these diverging results, the exact role of genetic variation at the HLA region and susceptibility to PD remains to be resolved.",

The present study investigated whether HD is associated with changes in emotional responses to a variety of visual and verbal stimuli selected to elicit core disgust, moral disgust, fear and happiness. Thirteen patients with HD and twelve controls provided emotional ratings after both reading emotion eliciting scenarios and viewing pictures from the International Affective Picture System database. Patients with HD exhibited executive dysfunction. In comparison to controls, they gave similar ratings for happy stimuli and did not differ significantly in response to core disgust or moral disgust stimuli. However, they did exhibit lower fear ratings in response to both sets of fear stimuli (pictures and scenarios), and higher anger ratings than controls in response to fear pictures. These differences in fear response could reflect dysfunction within frontostriatal pathways involving the amygdala. Changes to fear responses in HD may impair decision making and lead to increased risk-taking behaviour with significant personal or social consequences.",

Although the role of alpha-synuclein in the pathology of PD is still unclear, the fact that its aggregation contributes to the loss of dopaminergic neurons has been confirmed. Therefore, controlling the alpha-synuclein protein level may be critical for PD pathogenesis and may provide potential therapeutics. Wild-type alpha-synuclein is physiologically degraded by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), and dysfunction of CMA results in alpha-synuclein aggregation and compensative macroautophagy activation which finally leads to cell death. Therefore, CMA may participate in PD pathogenesis as a very important factor, and up-regulating CMA activity could degrade overloaded alpha-synuclein. In view of potential compensative effects, maintenance of the balance of CMA activity will be another major challenge in the future development of the therapeutic strategy.

Data collected included referral reasons, pre-operative evaluation, DBS programming thresholds, DBS placement, need for optimization of therapy, and ultimate patient outcomes.Ninety percent of patients reported at least one area of symptomatic dissatisfaction with the results of their DBS. Common issues included pre-operative misdiagnosis (28%), presence or exacerbation of symptoms not addressable by current DBS technology (48%), lead misplacement (43%), and need for medication (27%) or DBS programming (37%) optimization. Compared with leads placed using microelectrode recording (MER), leads placed without MER were strongly associated with misplacement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Overall, 42% of subjects had no improvement, 37% slight improvement and 21% large improvement after medical and/or surgical management.This study reveals common reasons why DBS patients may seek follow-up care at another institution. Although 90% of patients reported one or more problematic areas, many of these could not be addressed by current DBS technology.

To examine this question, comprehensive assessments of motor and non-motor symptoms from 249 subjects with idiopathic PD followed in three community-based movement disorders neurology practices were analyzed. HS was measured using the 8-item PD Questionnaire (PDQ-8). Psychiatric diagnoses were established by consensus using a panel of six psychiatrists with expertise in geriatric psychiatry and movement disorders. Stepwise multiple regression analyses were used, with the PDQ-8 score as the dependent variable, to identify independent predictors of HS among motor, psychiatric, and other non-motor variables. Among the anxiety disorders, only anxiety associated with motor fluctuations was an independent predictor of HS after accounting for co-morbid depression and other clinical features. In addition, depressive disorders were also an independent predictor of lower HS. Prevention or treatment of state-dependent anxiety may improve HS in persons with PD.",

Clinical data included the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), motor and non-motor symptoms. The generic instrument EuroQol (EQ-5D and EQ-VAS) was used to evaluate HrQol. Factors influencing HrQol were assessed by multivariate regression analysis.Severe problems in at least one dimension of the EQ-5D were experienced by 60% of PD patients versus 4.7% in general Italian population.

This study investigated the acute effects of the novel mGluR5 antagonist AFQ056 on motor behavior in l-Dopa-treated monkeys with a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) lesion to model PD. Six Macaca fascicularis MPTP monkeys were treated repeatedly with l-Dopa; this treatment increased their locomotion and reduced their parkinsonian scores, but also induced dyskinesias. When AFQ056 (doses of 5, 25, 125 or 250\u00a0mg/kg) was administered one hour prior to a high dose of l-Dopa, the antiparkinsonian activity of l-Dopa was maintained as measured with locomotion and antiparkinsonian scores, whereas dyskinesias were significantly reduced at 25, 125 and 250\u00a0mg/kg AFQ056 for peak dyskinesia score and at 125 and 250\u00a0mg/kg for the 1\u00a0h peak period of dyskinesia score. Administration of AFQ056 one hour before l-Dopa led to peak or elevated plasma AFQ056 concentrations occurring close to l-Dopa peak-dose dyskinesias. We next investigated AFQ056 25\u00a0mg/kg combined with a low dose of l-Dopa. The antiparkinsonian activity of l-Dopa was increased as measured with locomotion, while dyskinesias remained low at these doses. Our results show a beneficial motor effect of AFQ056 with l-Dopa in MPTP monkeys. This supports the therapeutic use of an mGluR5 antagonist to restore normal glutamatergic neurotransmission in PD and decrease dyskinesias.",

Little is known about outpatient interventions that might reduce the need for hospitalization and also reduce hospital-related complications.A literature review was performed on PubMed about hospitalization and PD between 1970 and 2010. In addition, in press peer-reviewed papers or published abstracts known to the authors were included. Information was reviewed by a National Parkinson Foundation workgroup and a narrative review article was generated.Motor disturbances in PD are believed to be a causal factor in the higher rates of admissions and complications. However, other conditions are commonly recorded as the primary reason for hospitalization including motor complications, reduced mobility, lack of compliance, inappropriate use of neuroleptics, falls, fractures, pneumonia, and other important medical problems. There are many relevant issues related to hospitalization in PD. Medications, dosages and specific dosage schedules are critical. Staff training regarding medications and medication management may help to avoid complications, particularly those related to reduced mobility, and aspiration pneumonia. Treatment of infections and a return to early mobility is also critical to management.Educational programs, recommendations, and guidelines are needed to better train interdisciplinary teams in the management of the PD patient. These initiatives have the potential for both cost savings and improved outcomes from a preventative and a hospital management standpoint.",

In this study, we compared the pharmacokinetics of LD between two groups of elderly PD patients, early- (75 years or younger) and late-elderly (76 years or older). After oral administration of a tablet containing 100\u00a0mg LD per 10\u00a0mg carbidopa in 155 PD patients, we measured plasma LD concentrations. Peak drug concentration (Cmax), time to peak drug concentration (Tmax), halftime of drug (T1/2) and area under the curve (AUC) were determined. AUC and T1/2 were significantly higher and longer, respectively, in the late-elderly group than in the early-elderly group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and <0.05, respectively). However, Cmax and Tmax were not statistically different between the groups. The present data indicate that LD absorption is consistent in PD patients, regardless of age. The difference in oral LD bioavailability between the groups may result from a difference in excretion ability. Physicians should consider LD pharmacokinetics when treating elderly PD patients.",

We assessed observer variability and validity in reporting of impulse control disorder (ICD) symptoms in PD by using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson\u2019s Disease (QUIP). PD patients and their informants (71 pairs) completed the QUIP to assess four ICDs (compulsive gambling, buying, sexual behavior, and eating) in patients. Trained raters then administered a diagnostic interview. Sensitivity of the QUIP for a diagnosed ICD was 100% for both patient- and informant-completed instruments, and specificity was 75% for both raters. Approximately 40% of patients without an ICD diagnosis had a positive QUIP, suggesting that many PD patients experience subsyndromal ICD symptoms that require ongoing monitoring. Agreement between patient- and informant-reporting of any ICD behaviors on the QUIP was moderate (kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.408), and for individual ICDs was highest for gambling (kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.550). Overall, a negative QUIP from either the patient or informant rules out the possibility of an ICD, while a positive QUIP requires a follow-up diagnostic interview and ongoing monitoring to determine if symptoms currently are, or in the future become, clinically significant.",

To address responsiveness, ON/OFF medication performance was compared. To address predictive validity, areas under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were compared. Comparisons were made using separate non-parametric tests.Thirty-six persons (24 male, 12 female) with PD (22 fallers, 14 non-fallers) participated. Only the FGA was able to detect differences between fallers and non-fallers for both ON/OFF medication testing. The predictive validity of the FGA and the TUG for fall identification was higher during OFF medication compared to ON medication testing. The predictive validity of the FGA was higher than the TUG and the Pull test during ON and OFF medication testing.In order to most accurately identify fallers, clinicians should test persons with PD in ecologically relevant conditions and tasks.

Subcortical volume was measured automatically by FreeSurfer. Multivariate analysis of covariance, adjusted for intracranial volume (ICV), sex and age, was used to explore group differences.No volumetric differences were found between PD and controls group; otherwise the volumes of the cerebellum, the thalamus, the putamen, the pallidum, the hippocampus, and the brainstem were significantly reduced in PSP and MSA-P compared to patients with PD and control subjects. PSP and MSA-P patients only differed in thalamus volume which was smaller in PSP group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Moreover, patients with PSP and MSA-P showed a ventricular system (including lateral, third and fourth ventricles) larger than that detected in PD and controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Volumetric data obtained with automated segmentation of cerebral regions show a significant atrophy of different brain structures in parkinsonisms rather than in PD.

Symptoms, pathology and physiology of the cardiovascular, skin/sweat gland, urinary, gastrointestinal, pupillary and neuroendocrine systems can be probed by autopsy, biopsy and non-invasive electrophysiological techniques in vivo which assess autonomic anatomy and function. There is mounting evidence that PD affects a chain of neurons in autonomic pathways. Consequently, autonomic physiology may serve as a window into non-motor PD progression and allow the development of mechanistically based treatment strategies for several non-motor features of PD. End-organ physiologic markers may be used to inform a model of PD pathophysiology and non-motor progression.",

     "abstract": "Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder contributed by both environmental and genetic factors. The inconsistent findings in genetic association studies may be due to unrecognized interactions with other genetic or environmental factors. Therefore, we assessed the combined effects of genetic variants of three candidate genes of familial PD and environmental exposure on risk of PD in Taiwanese population. A total of 744 study subjects, 453 PD cases and 291 ethnicity-matched controls, were included. The genetic variants on the PINK1, BDNF, and LRRK2 genes were sequenced accordingly. We used a regression approach based on a generalized linear model to evaluate single-locus genotype effects and detection of gene\u2013environment interaction by incorporating interaction terms in the model. We found a significant difference of LRRK2 G2385R and R1628P between PD patients and controls, which confirmed our previous findings. A logistic regression model which included gene\u2013environment interactions was applied. Notably, we identified the variant of LRRK2 T4939A (S1647T) (TT, OR\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.36, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) is associated with increased PD risk, after considering the interaction effects with environmental factors in the model. Additionally, two novel interactions were detected: pesticide exposure with BDNF (OR\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.85, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and to a lesser extent, with PINK1 (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.99, p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). Our findings reinforced the importance that PD risk is modulated by both genetic and environmental exposures. LRRK2 S1647T may be another risk factor for PD development in our ethnicity while considering the joint interaction effects with environmental factors.",

We therefore argue that taking the patients\u2019 perspectives of their condition may allow for a more in-depth assessment of patient goals and subsequent tailoring of care.One hundred and forty-eight patients with idiopathic PD completed a modified version of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Questionnaire (PCOQ-PD), to evaluate treatment success and expectations from the patient\u2019s perspective across 10 motor and non-motor functional domains. We also examined patient subgroups based on importance of improvement in various domains.Patients\u2019 ratings suggested there was substantial variation in functional interference that was generally unrelated to demographic variables. On average, across all domains, patients indicated a 50.32% reduction in symptoms would be successful (range\u00a0=\u00a040.63\u201358.23%), regardless of treatment experience. Change scores between patients\u2019 usual levels of symptom interference and their treatment success levels suggested a greater degree of change was desired in motor versus non-motor domains (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Finally, cluster analyses revealed two patient subgroups based on overall importance of improvement (High vs. Low Importance Endorsement). Notably, the two groups differed in self-reported usual symptom levels despite having similar clinical severity.We empirically examined treatment success from the PD patient\u2019s view as opposed to clinician judgment alone, thereby broadening the set of criteria by which to evaluate outcome. Findings from this exploratory study may guide future treatment emphases and guide patient-provider communication via clarification of patient-defined success.",

Our primary outcome measure was the frequency of patient telephone calls over a three-month period relative to baseline demographics, State-Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) scores, Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores, and medication use. Based on the median call rate (1 call/3 months), subjects were dichotomized into frequent (\u22652 calls) and infrequent (\u22641 call) caller groups.A total of 297 calls were received, of which 264 (89%) were from the frequent caller group (n\u00a0=\u00a063 subjects), and only 33 (11%) were from the infrequent caller group (n\u00a0=\u00a0112 subjects). Compared with calls from infrequent callers, those from frequent callers more commonly related to somatic symptoms of PD (46.8% vs. 19.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, independent predictors of frequent calling were: anxiety (STAI \u226555; adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.62, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), sleep disorders (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.36, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), dyskinesias (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a03.07, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and dopamine agonist use (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.27, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).

Aggressive treatment of these non-motor symptoms and motor complications might potentially reduce the burden of patient telephone calls in PD.",

Simultaneous cardiac measures (respiratory sinus arrythmia during deep breathing, Valsalva ratio, resting heart rate variability (HRV), orthostatic change in blood pressure and orthostatic change in heart rate) were obtained. Nonparametric statistics were used to compare PD with control participants and to calculate correlation coefficients between pupillary and cardiac measures.Pupillary unrest and orthostatic decreases in systolic blood pressure were greater in PD than controls. Respiratory sinus arrythmia during deep breathing and resting HRV were lower in PD. Among all participants, there was a negative correlation between HRV and redilation velocity and a positive correlation between orthostatic change in heart rate and pupillary unrest. A modifying effect of PD was found on the association between high frequency HRV and pupillary unrest.Results demonstrate simultaneous autonomic dysfunction in both pupillary and cardiac systems in PD. The correlations between pupillary and cardiac measures suggest shared central centers of autonomic integration, while the modifying effect of PD may reflect autonomic effects of PD-related pathology not present in controls.",

We retrospectively analyzed data from 17 stable HP rhesus monkeys treated long-term with chronic intermittent dosing of levodopa (LD) in an attempt to induce choreoathetoid and dystonic dyskinesias. Rhesus monkeys in stable HP state for greater than 6 months as confirmed by multiple blinded behavioral ratings and 18F-dopa Positron Emission Tomography (PET) were treated with optimal doses of LD to provide maximal amelioration of unilateral clinical parkinsonism without any adverse effects. Thereafter, each animal was given chronic intermittent daily challenge with doses of LD up to 700\u00a0mg/day orally or with 300\u00a0mg/kg/day parenteral injections.

These results suggest that the stable strictly unilateral HP rhesus monkey model of PD may not be a suitable animal model to test experimental therapeutics targeted against dyskinesias, and that bilateral parkinsonian rhesus models that readily demonstrate drug-induced dyskinesias and clinically relevant motor fluctuations are more appropriate for preclinical experimental testing of therapies designed to treat patients with advanced PD.",

ROS including hydroxyl radicals and H2O2 react with guanine residues in DNA and produce 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). 8-OHdG serves as a biomarker for oxidative stress in various diseases.We investigated urinary 8-OHdG levels in 61 PD patients and 28 normal subjects to evaluate the correlation with various clinical features. We quantified disease severity using the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale for motor symptoms (UPDRS part 3), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for mental function, and the Tottori University Hallucination Rating Scale (TUHARS) for quantifying hallucinations.There were significant correlations between 8-OHdG and all the examined parameters, but the partial correlation coefficients excluding contributions of all the other parameters showed that only TUHARS and UPDRS part 3 are significantly related to 8-OHdG. In particular, TUHARS correlates best with urinary 8-OHdG levels.The significant correlation between urinary 8-OHdG levels and hallucinations but not with dementia suggests that hallucinations are likely to have unique but unidentified mechanisms that lead to excessive production of 8-OHdG.",

     "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nuclei (STN) is a well established treatment in advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Based on the clinical efficacy and elicited side-effects, both unipolar and bipolar stimulation modes may be applied. Bipolar stimulation usually produces a more focused and therefore thinner area of tissue activated during stimulation than unipolar stimulation does. The primary aim of our clinical study was to quantify the different clinical efficacy between these two stimulation modes.Twenty-one patients with PD previously underwent bilateral STN DBS implantation were involved in the study. Approximately three years after the implantation, we evaluated rigidity, tremor and bradykinesia according to the Unified Parkinson\u2019s disease Rating Scale in a practically off condition. Keeping the cathode of the chronic stimulation setting constant, the amplitude of stimulation was changed between 0 and 3.6\u00a0V by 0.2\u00a0V steps. Subsequently, the improvements in rigidity, tremor and bradykinesia were compared between unipolar and bipolar modes using 60\u00a0\u03bcs pulse-width and 130\u00a0Hz frequency.Within the examined amplitude range, unipolar stimulation usually had a significantly higher efficacy than bipolar stimulation; however, also with a higher rate of side-effects (19% vs. 0%). Depending on the evaluated parkinsonian symptoms, the efficacy of uni- and bipolar stimulation was different. To achieve the same level of improvement during bipolar stimulation, approximately 0.4\u20130.5\u00a0V higher amplitude was required than in unipolar mode. However in some cases, the efficacy of bipolar stimulation was unable the reach that of unipolar stimulation within the examined amplitude range.",

     "abstract": "More than a third of stroke patients will develop post-stroke spasticity, especially involving the paretic upper limbs. Despite established, intensive rehabilitation programmes in place, spasticity may still affect a post-stroke patient\u2019s quality of life and create economic and caregiver burdens. Hence, there is a need to explore how botulinum toxin (BTX) therapy may further improve patient outcomes. Consensus guidelines on the clinical use of BTX for established and symptomatic upper-limb spasticity are now available. While BTX therapy has been universally shown to reduce muscle tone in spasticity, its corresponding improvement in functional-outcome measures are far from consistent. This review article attempts to analyse the reasons for the inconsistency and makes the case that improved and reliable functional outcomes after BTX therapy may be achieved when: patient-specific goals that incorporate realistic expectations (such as improving passive as well as active functions and reducing pain) are used as functional-outcome measures; patients are followed up over a reasonable amount of time so as to optimise learning, rehabilitation and possibly even allow plasticity to occur; and, correct and thoughtful muscle targeting that considers various factors, such as spread, technique and avoidance of compensatory muscles, is employed. This article also summarises the characteristics of post-stroke patients who are at greatest risk for developing spasticity and those who are most likely to become the \u201cbest responders;\u201d and, it attempts to outline the potential advantages of early BTX therapy in the acute to sub-acute post-stroke period, while spasticity is still evolving.",

Muscle spindles play a pivotal role in the generation of dystonic movements. Abnormal behaviour in the muscle spindles that generates an irregular proprioceptive input via the group-IA afferents may result in abnormal cortical excitability and intracortical inhibition in dystonia. The aim of this article is to support our hypothesis that dystonic movement is at the end of an impaired function of somatosensory pathways and analysers, which, in turn, may be hinged on the abnormality of sensorimotor integration, that is, brain plasticity. BoNT treatment can potentially modulate this plasticity mechanism and is probably the seminal cause of the sustained effect of the subsequent BoNT-treatment sessions and the long-term alleviation of symptoms of dystonia.",

     "abstract": "Although the subspeciality of movement disorders was established in neurology more than 20 years ago, it is relatively new in Thailand, and while most physicians are generally aware of Parkinson\u2019s disease, they often are not familiar with dystonia. As one of the common movement disorders seen in general practice, a number of family and population studies have suggested that as many as two-thirds of patients with dystonia may be underdiagnosed and it is likely that misdiagnosis occurs frequently. Moreover, there is little information on the prevalence of dystonia in Thailand.The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical profile of dystonia among Thai patients who came from the southern part of Bangkok, which is in the catchment area of Chulalongkorn University Hospital. In addition, the diagnostic accuracy of dystonia among referred patients was assessed. The medical records of 207 patients were reviewed and it was determined that a large proportion of them (71.9%) had focal dystonia with cervical dystonia being the most common form. Primary dystonia (68.1%) accounted for the majority of the cases. The prevalence of all forms of dystonia, primary dystonia and focal dystonia was 19.9, 13.6 and 14.3 per 100\u2008000 persons, respectively.The diagnostic accuracy of dystonia among referred patients was 85.5%. The most common misdiagnosis was cervical spondylosis, followed by myofascial pain syndrome. Most patients had an average disease duration of 4 years before dystonia was finally diagnosed. Most patients with focal dystonia responded well to botulinum toxin therapy, with 13.3% suffering only mild transient adverse events. In spite of the limitations of this study, this data will initiate a process of increasing both patient and professional awareness of dystonia in Thailand.",

Its extraordinarily high toxicity depends on the affinity of the receptor-binding site to the receptor located inside the synaptosome. The membrane fusion mechanism is important not only in neurotransmitter release at the nerve terminals but also in the expression of pain receptors on the cell surface. Based on these mechanisms, BoNT is increasingly used for varieties of conditions including cosmetic uses, muscle hyperactivity, hyperhydrosis, pain, overactive bladder and epilepsy. It will become a major arm of neuromodulating treatments for neurological diseases. A part of this toxin, such as the heavy chain, may become a novel drug-delivery system for neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, clinical uses for botulinum toxin A have continued to expand, with increased use in conditions implicating sensory pain nerve dysfunction. Chronic pain is associated with excess pain fiber activity. When the site of this excess activity resides in the peripheral portion of the pain pathway, a condition of peripheral sensitization can establish. During this state, excess pain signaling reaches the central nervous system, which can then lead to a condition of central sensitization, manifesting as the symptoms associated with chronic pain (i.e. burning, electric pain, lowered pain threshold to normal stimuli, etc). Experimentally, botulinum toxin type A has been shown to reduce neuropeptides and neurotransmitter release from treated cells or nerve endings and to attenuate nociception in both neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain models. This review summarizes the literature to update the hypothesis for the mechanism by which botulinum toxin type A can modulate chronic pain.",

     "abstract": "Botulinum toxin (BTX), the exotoxin of the obligate anaerobe, Clostridium botulinum, is used to ameliorate pain and treat conditions associated with glandular, smooth and skeletal muscle overactivity. The benefits derived from the injection of BTX may be negated by unintended weakness of uninjected muscles. Performance of BTX injections may be facile, requiring only surface marking or clinical-localisation techniques but may be more technically demanding, necessitating the use of equipment, such as electromyography (EMG) or ultrasonography (U/S). Less often, endoscopic, fluoroscopic or computed tomographic (CT) guidance may be required. Despite evidence to support the efficacy of BTX injections in treating many conditions, there is no evidence to support the superiority of any one injection technique over needle localisation using surface anatomy. This is possibly due to the lack of well-designed controlled studies, that is, current studies are hampered by small patient numbers, lack of consistency of injection technique and the application of different rating scales. Intuitively, certain injection techniques are more suited to injection of specific muscles or conditions, for example, U/S or passive-monitoring EMG should be used to treat cervical dystonia, active-monitoring EMG applied for strabismus injections, whereas either active-monitoring EMG or endoscopy is indicated when giving BTX for spasmodic dysphonia. Finally, electrical-stimulation EMG or U/S (or a combination of both) would be most suitable when injecting the forearm muscles for spasticity or writer\u2019s cramps.",

The LFP signals were categorised into episodes of tremorous and atremorous activity (identified through EMG power spectra), then divided into delta (2\u20134\u00a0Hz), theta (4\u20138\u00a0Hz), alpha (8\u201313\u00a0Hz), and beta (13\u201330\u00a0Hz) frequency bands. Modulation of LFP oscillatory activity in these frequency bands were compared between the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) to determine if differential tremor-related characteristics were identifiable for either target. Our results suggest that such local characteristic activity is identifiable in the STN, and thus could be a target for initial development of a closed-loop demand driven stimulator device which capitalises on such activity to trigger stimulation, even during voluntary movement activity.",

Seventy one of them accepted to be evaluated for neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric studies with the aim to compare mutation carriers with non-carriers. For neuropsychological testing, comparisons between LRRK2 G2019S carriers and non-carriers were made after stratification according to the level of education: median and high school versus low level. Memory was investigated with the five words test, 2 novel tests with verbalized visual material dedicated to illiterate patients, the TNI-93 (nine pictures test), The TMA-93 (associative memory test), and digit spans (forward/backward). Cognitive analyse did not show major differences between the two groups of patients. Nevertheless, behavioral abnormalities, mostly depression and hallucinations, were more frequent in the LRRK2 G2019S carriers, suggesting the presence of a greater involvement of the limbic system in these patients. Sleep disorders which were also more common amongst mutation carriers than non-carriers might be related to depression.",

Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that only the existence of RBD symptoms was significantly associated with reduced MIBG uptake among PD patients without dementia after adjusting for demographic and PD symptom-related variables.PD patients with clinical RBD might suffer from a wider \u03b1-synuclein pathology, including reduced cardiac sympathetic ganglia function as reflected by a lowered MIBG uptake.",

     "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms are common in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), generally associated with the medications used to treat the motor symptoms. On rare occasion they occur in patients not taking medication for PD. Psychotic symptoms are usually hallucinations, typically visual, less commonly auditory, and rarely in other domains. Hallucinations are generally stereotyped and without emotional content. Initially patients usually have insight so that the hallucinations are benign in terms of their immediate impact but have poor prognostic implications, with increased risk of dementia, worsened psychotic symptoms and mortality. Delusions occur in about 5\u201310% of drug treated patients and are considerably more disruptive, being paranoid in nature, often of spousal infidelity or abandonment by family. Treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease psychosis (PDP) focuses on reducing the psychiatric symptom load while balancing the competing problem of mobility. Contributors to the psychotic symptoms should be searched for, such as systemic illness and other psycho-active medications. If none are identified or can be eliminated then the PD medications should be reduced to the lowest levels that allow tolerable motor function. Once this level has been reached there are two schools of thought on treatment, using either acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or atypical anti-psychotics. Only clozapine has level I evidence to support its use. Quetiapine is the only other anti-psychotic free of motor side effects, but it has failed double blind placebo controlled trials to demonstrate efficacy.",

The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of idiopathic PD in a rural area of North-East England.The same case-finding methodology as that employed in North Tyneside was used to identify cases of PD in an area of North Northumberland with a population of 59,613 at the 2001 UK census. All GPs in the study area were asked to provide details of patients registered with their service that may have PD or were on PD medication. Furthermore, all patients registered with the local PD service or under the care of a consultant neurologist or other relevant secondary care specialist were considered for inclusion. Inclusion in the study required fulfilment of the UK Brain Bank criteria.One-hundred-and-six cases were identified (50 women and 56 men), giving crude and age-adjusted prevalence estimates of 178 cases (95% CI 144 to 212) and 142 cases (95% CI 118 to 165) per 100,000 respectively.

Their clinical characteristics included: early onset, dominant myoclonus and dystonia in the neck, trunk and upper limbs. By direct sequencing of the SGCE gene coding regions, we identified a small heterozygous deletion (c.842delA) in exon 7 of the three sibs and asymptomatic father in the first family and an eight-base heterozygous deletion (c.524_531del) in exon 5 of the mother and a daughter in the second family. Using multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), a large heterozygous deletion of 2\u201311 exons was identified in the father and a son in the third family which was undetected by initial sequencing. It is the largest intragenic deletion ever reported. In conclusion, we have identified three novel mutations of SGCE in the respective three M\u2013D families. The large deletion was responsible for one third of these M\u2013D families which might implicate an important contribution to Taiwanese M\u2013D syndrome. We suggest that the contribution of large deletion should be further verified in a large cohort of patients with M\u2013D syndrome in Han Chinese.",

To date, studies suggest that this relationship, believed to be due to involvement of nondopaminergic circuitry, occurs later in the disease process. Research has yet to adequately investigate this cognitive-posturomotor relationship especially when examining earlier disease states. To gain greater understanding of the relationship between postural stability and cognitive function/dysfunction we evaluated a more stringent, objective measure of postural stability (center of pressure displacement), and also more specific measures of cognition in twenty-two patients with early to moderate stage Parkinson\u2019s disease. The magnitude of the center of pressure displacement in this cohort was negatively correlated with performance on tests known to activate dorsolateral frontal regions. Additionally, the postural stability item of the UPDRS exhibited poor correlation with the more objective measure of center of pressure displacement and all specific measures of cognition. These results may serve as rationale for a more thorough evaluation of postural stability and cognition especially in individuals with mild Parkinson\u2019s disease. Greater understanding of the relationship between motor and cognitive processes in Parkinson\u2019s disease will be critical for understanding the disease process and its potential therapeutic possibilities.",

To address this issue further we analysed neurovascular coupling in a non-motor area.Twenty PD patients selected for bilateral STN-DBS were investigated with functional transcranial Doppler (f-TCD) before and after surgery. Hemodynamic responses to visual stimulation were registered in left posterior cerebral artery (PCA) and analysed with a control-system approach (parameters gain, rate time, attenuation and natural frequency).

Genetic expression and plasticity may determine pre-disposition to age of onset of PD and dyskinesia, these are currently non-modifiable factors arising due to an interaction of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Lower initial body weight and weight loss during the course of the disease increase the risk of dyskinesia. Levodopa dose per kilogram body weight is a more significant risk factor than absolute levodopa dose. Early use of longer acting non-levodopa (i.e. dopamine agonists) medications delays the onset of dyskinesia. Interaction between body weight, levodopa dose and mode and duration of drug delivery is a significant modifiable factor.Dyskinesia in PD arises as a consequence of the interaction of intrinsic versus extrinsic and modifiable versus non-modifiable factors. Identification and manipulation of modifiable factors for an individual patient may reduce the risk and burden of dyskinesia. Adjustment of levodopa dose according to body weight during the course of the disease seems to be a significant modifiable risk factor for dyskinesia.",

     "abstract": "Differential diagnosis between patients with Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) may be confusing, particularly in early disease stages. However, in contrast to PD, CBS shows a widespread cortical atrophy that suggests an involvement of the corpus callosum (CC). To test this hypothesis, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a 1.5T scanner to compare 14 CBS patients, 14 PD patients, and an age-matched control group. The mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were determined in the whole CC and in five subdivisions. Group comparisons were performed using the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. We found a significantly increased MD and decreased FA in CBS patients compared to PD, particularly in the posterior truncus. No differences were found between PD patients and controls. A receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis shows that the MD is particularly useful for discriminating between the two neurodegenerative diseases. Our data suggest that abnormal CC diffusivity in CBS reflects an atrophy and degraded transcallosal connectivity, making the CC a potential target to differentiate CBS from PD patients.",

However, the sensitivity of some of the cognitive measures used for detecting change in cognitive status in early PD patients is not known nor is the relationship between cognitive outcome measures and other motor and non-motor disease characteristics and various demographic parameters in early PD patients. The current analysis of the NET-PD cohort (i.e., untreated patients) was undertaken to: 1) assess which (if any) baseline demographic parameters correlate with baseline cognitive measures and any potential change in cognitive measures over the 12\u201318 months evaluation period; 2) assess the extent to which cognitive measures employed (i.e., Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS), Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and Letter-Number Sequencing) are sensitive to change over time; 3) examine whether initiation of symptomatic therapy is associated with change in cognitive status. At baseline, NET-PD subjects had no significant impairment on the assessments employed. Only education and age were significant predictors of cognitive score at baseline. None of the summary measures were indicative of change in cognitive status over the 12\u201318 months of study. These results suggest either the cognitive domains examined are not affected in the population examined or that more sensitive measures of cognition than those currently employed may need to be considered for use in a large trial setting in which an early, highly educated PD population is studied.",

Positive response to acute levodopa test was defined as an improvement of at least 15% in the tapping test, and at least 25% in the walking test and rigidity or tremor score. Subsequently, all patients were treated continuously with levodopa and evaluated after 6 and 12 months by means of UPDRS II/III.Positive response to the acute levodopa test was observed in 55% of DLB patients (acute DLB responders), and in 90% of PD patients (acute PD responders). Acute DLB responders showed increased latency, and reduction of both duration and amplitude of response to acute levodopa in comparison with acute PD responders. At the 6-month follow-up visit, acute DLB responders showed a greater motor benefit compared with acute DLB non-responders. This improvement was similar to that observed in PD patients. However, at 1-year follow-up acute DLB responders showed a faster worsening of UPDRS III scores compared with acute PD responders, implying a reduction of levodopa efficacy.Positive response to acute levodopa test can occur in DLB patients and may be predictive of long-term benefit of chronic levodopa therapy, although the motor improvement is less impressive than in PD patients.",

Yet, thermolitic lesion of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is still a valid option when DBS cannot be applied, and little has been published regarding its impact on cognition and mood. We examined the cognitive and neuropsychiatric functions of 10 consecutive patients with advanced PD undergoing simultaneous bilateral subthalamotomies. With 24 months of follow-up, the patients, three of whom were on anticholinergics prior to surgery, showed no deterioration in cognitive assessments including verbal fluency. Hypoactive behaviors (depression and apathy) showed lasting improvement, while hyperactive behaviors (euphoria and disinhibition) transiently increased after surgery. Improvement in hypoactive behaviors correlated with improvement in hypokinetic movements, and enhanced hyperactive behaviors followed the course of post-operative hyperkinetic movements. Such correlations may support the role of the STN in modulating limbic connections between the basal ganglia and frontal cortex. The results of this proof-of-concept pilot study suggest the need for larger, long-term, randomized controlled studies to assess motor, neuropsychiatric, behavioral and radiologic correlations after subthalamotomies.",

     "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established surgical treatment for Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), essential tremor and dystonia. It is generally acknowledged that the development of DBS as we know it today started with the publication of Benabid, Pollak et al in 1987 on thalamic DBS for tremor. This technique gained momentum in the mid-Nineties after that Pollak and Benabid introduced the subthalamic nucleus as a target in advanced PD.This paper reviews the gestational pre-natal era of deep brain stimulation, before 1987. The origin of DBS can be traced back to the practice of intra-operative electrical stimulation, used for target exploration prior to lesioning, during the early years of stereotactic functional neurosurgery. During the 60s, Sem-Jacobsen and others implanted externalised electrodes which were used for intermittent stimulation and evaluation during weeks or months, prior to subsequent ablation of thalamic and other basal ganglia targets. In the early 70s Bechtereva treated PD patients using \u201ctherapeutic electrical stimulation\u201d through electrodes implanted for up to 1.5 years. In the late 70s and early 80s the term Deep Brain Stimulation was coined and few groups attempted treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease, non-Parkinsonian tremor and dystonia with high-frequency stimulation using chronically implanted DBS systems. Cumbersome, un-sophisticated DBS hardware, together with the general decline of all surgery for PD following the introduction of levodopa, may have contributed to the lack of popularity of old-times DBS. It is to the credit of the Grenoble Group to have reinvented, modernised and expanded modern DBS in surgical treatment of movement disorders.",

This is a retrospective database and record review from a movement disorder clinic. Of 421 dystonia patients, we identified 17 with LPD (4%). Of these cases, the diagnoses were: primary cranial dystonia (5), primary generalized dystonia (2), tardive dystonia (7), heredodegenerative disease (1), multifactorial (1) and post-infectious (1). All primary cases had concomitant oromandibular dystonia. In\u00a0some secondary cases the LPD was the only cranial feature. Nine received botulinum toxin injections and 55.6% sustained moderate or marked improvement. Of 89 total botulinum toxin sessions, 66.3% had an excellent response, and 92.1% had some response. 97.8% of the sessions resulted in no significant adverse effects. On one occasion one patient developed severe dysphagia requiring placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tube. We conclude that LPD is rare, most commonly the result of tardive and primary dystonia. Botulinum toxin therapy may be very effective but needs to be utilized with care because of the possibility for the development of dysphagia.",

The glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are candidate genes for PD because they are involved in the metabolism of pesticides and cigarette smoke. We investigated the relationship of the seven GST polymorphisms (GSTM1 deletion, GSTT1 deletion, GSTP1 rs1695, GSTO1 rs4925, GSTO1 rs11191972, GSTO2 rs156697 and GSTO2 rs2297235) and PD risk with special reference to the interaction with pesticide use or cigarette smoking among 238 patients with PD cases and 370 controls in a Japanese population. None of the GST polymorphisms were associated with PD. GSTO1 rs4925 and GSTO2 rs2297235 were found to be in strong linkage disequilibrium (D\u2032\u00a0=\u00a00.98). Cigarette smoking was significantly associated with decreased risk of PD. However, no interaction of smoking with any of the GST polymorphisms was observed. Self-reported pesticide use was not associated with increased risk of PD. There was no evidence of interaction between self-reported pesticide use and either GST polymorphism. Our results suggest that the tested GST polymorphisms did not play an important role in PD susceptibility in our Japanese population. Our study does not give evidence of interaction between the GST polymorphisms and smoking may although this study provided sufficient statistical power to detect modest interaction. As for interaction between GSTP polymorphisms and pesticide use, the power of this study to detect an interactive effect was low due to a small number of pesticide users. Future studies involving larger control and case populations and better pesticide exposure histories will undoubtedly lead to a more thorough understanding of the role of the GST polymorphisms in PD development.",

     "abstract": "Studies using the Iowa gambling task (IGT) have shown that patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) make disadvantageous choices characterized by immediate large rewards and delayed larger punishments. These results can be interpreted in two ways: either PD patients are hypersensitive to immediate outcomes and/or insensitive to delayed consequences or PD patients are hypersensitive to rewards and/or insensitive to punishments. In this study, we used a modified IGT in which selection of cards from the disadvantageous decks leads to immediate, small punishments and delayed, smaller rewards and selection of cards from the advantageous decks leads to immediate, large punishments and delayed larger rewards. We then compared the results obtained using this modified IGT with those obtained using the original IGT. If the PD patients were hypersensitive to the immediate outcomes of decisions, they would make disadvantageous choices in both the original and the modified IGTs. Differences between the results of the original and modified tasks would indicate impairments in balancing reward and punishment. In our analysis, PD patients selected advantageous decks and gained as much as normal subjects during the modified IGT, but they selected disadvantageous decks during the original IGT. These results indicate that the decision-making difficulties of PD patients are caused by their inability to balance reward and punishment and their hypersensitivity to reward and/or insensitivity to punishment.",

Mucuna pruriens, a legume extensively used in Ayurveda to treat PD, is reputed to provide anti-parkinsonian benefits without inducing DID. We compared the behavioral effects of chronic parenteral administration of a water extract of M. pruriens seed powder (MPE) alone without any additives, MPE combined with the peripheral dopa-decarboxylase inhibitor (DDCI) benserazide (MPE\u00a0+\u00a0BZ), LD\u00a0+\u00a0BZ and LD alone without BZ in the hemiparkinsonian rat model of PD. A battery of behavioral tests assessed by blinded investigators served as outcome measures in these randomized trials. In experiment 1, animals that received LD\u00a0+\u00a0BZ or MPE\u00a0+\u00a0BZ at high (6\u00a0mg/kg) and medium (4\u00a0mg/kg) equivalent doses demonstrated significant alleviation of parkinsonism, but, developed severe dose-dependent DID. LD\u00a0+\u00a0BZ at low doses (2\u00a0mg/kg) did not provide significant alleviation of parkinsonism. In contrast, MPE\u00a0+\u00a0BZ at an equivalent low dose significantly ameliorated parkinsonism. In experiment 2, MPE without any additives (12\u00a0mg/kg and 20\u00a0mg/kg LD equivalent dose) alleviated parkinsonism with significantly less DID compared to LD\u00a0+\u00a0BZ or MPE\u00a0+\u00a0BZ. In experiment 3, MPE without additives administered chronically provided long-term anti-parkinsonian benefits without causing DID. In experiment 4, MPE alone provided significantly more behavioral benefit when compared to the equivalent dose of synthetic LD alone without BZ. In experiment 5, MPE alone reduced the severity of DID in animals initially primed with LD\u00a0+\u00a0BZ. These findings suggest that M. pruriens contains water-soluble ingredients that either have an intrinsic DDCI-like activity or mitigate the need for an add-on DDCI to ameliorate parkinsonism. These unique long-term anti-parkinsonian effects of a parenterally administered water extract of M. pruriens seed powder may provide a platform for future drug discoveries and novel treatment strategies in PD.",

The ToM abilities were not associated with other cognitive functions, depressive symptoms or clinical data. However, affective ToM was correlated with health-related quality of life (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Parkinson patients are impaired in affective as well as cognitive ToM. These deficits are largely independent from other cognitive impairments, depressive symptoms and motor impairment. The relationship of affective ToM to the health-related quality of life of PD patients points to a clinical relevance of this issue and suggests that ToM dysfunctions must be regarded as an important non-motor feature of Parkinson\u2019s disease.",

We compared the BMD of 108 PD patients (58 females) with an average age of 68 (range 42\u201383) years with that of 216 sex- and age-matched controls, adjusting for other covariate factors (exercise levels, estrogen status, dietary calcium intake, smoking, drinking, body mass index, and percentage of body fat). The mean BMD in the hip and lumbar spine of male PD patients did not differ significantly from those of male controls. On the other hand, the mean BMD in femoral neck was significantly lower in female PD patients than in controls (0.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0g/cm2 versus 0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10\u00a0g/cm2, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Compared with controls, female PD patients experienced menopause much earlier (47 years versus 50 years, P\u00a0=\u00a00.028). The percentage of body fat was also lower in female PD patients (33% versus 36%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). A lower BMD in the hip in female PD patients was associated with an increased number of months after menopause (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and lower percentage of body fat (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025). We concluded that female patients with PD have lower hip BMD, but this association appears largely attributable to differences in percentage body fat and years since menopause. After multivariate adjustment, PD no longer remained independently associated with reduced BMD in female patients.",

The age, disease duration, motor scores, quality of life (PDQ-39), and levodopa equivalent daily dosage (LEDD) were compared between PD droolers vs. PD non-droolers.58 PD patients and 51 age-matched controls participated. In PD patients, the mean: disease duration was 10.96 years (SD 8.66) and UPDRS on motor score was 30.76 (SD 10.57). The drooling severity score was significantly different between patients vs. controls (3.41 vs. .58; p\u00a0<\u00a0.01). 14% of controls vs. 59% of patients were droolers (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01).

Two trials (CALM-PD-CIT and REAL-PET studies) used neuroimaging dopamine changes as a surrogate marker for PD progression, and concluded that pramipexole and ropinirole could have a neuroprotective effect compared to levodopa. However, it should be recognized that all the presynaptic dopamine markers currently available for SPECT and PET studies are potentially subject to regulatory changes. Consequently, the results of these two trials can also be interpreted in terms of drug-related differences in dopamine regulation. More recently, the delayed-start design was applied to test whether rasagiline could have a neuroprotective effect in PD (ADAGIO study). Unfortunately, a major limitation of the delayed-start design is that, whenever the active treatment has a symptomatic effect, the blinding can be broken. This can lead to unequally-distributed placebo responses during phase 2, and is also a potential source of raters\u2019 biases. None of the trials on neuroprotective therapies for PD has yet provided solid evidence for neuroprotection.",

In order to investigate the pathophysiology of this phenomenon, we screened a population of Parkinson's disease (PD) outpatients who underwent subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN DBS).We conducted a patient-and-relative-completed survey with 24 consecutive patients in an academic outpatient care center, using a modified version of a structured interview. Patients were administered the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Obsessive\u2013Compulsive Inventory and the Sheehan Disability Scale.Five (20.8%) of the 24 subjects were identified as punders, including three men (60%) and two women. The punders were comparable to the non-punders in terms of clinical and demographic factors.

     "abstract": "Treatment-related motor complications such as dyskinesias are a major problem in the long-term management of Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). In sporadic PD, a relatively early onset of the disease is known to be associated with an early development of dyskinesias. Although linked with early onset, patients with Parkin-associated PD often show a stable long-term response to dopaminergic therapy without developing treatment-induced motor complications. Therefore, we reasoned that this difference in vulnerability to develop dyskinesias under long-term dopaminergic therapy may be associated with differences in movement-related activation patterns in Parkin-associated compared to sporadic PD. To test this hypothesis, medicated non-dyskinetic patients with either Parkin-associated or sporadic PD underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing externally specified or internally selected movements. Patients with Parkin-associated and sporadic PD showed no difference in movement-related activation patterns. Moreover, the covariates \u2018age\u2019 and \u2018disease duration\u2019 similarly influenced brain activation in both patient groups. The present finding suggests that a stable long-term motor response in some patients with Parkin-associated PD may not be related to differences in cortical recruitment. In conclusion, our findings corroborate a substantial pathophysiologic overlap between Parkin-associated and sporadic PD and lend further support to the notion that Parkin-associated PD is a suitable genetic model for sporadic PD.",

We\u00a0investigated whether this difficultyx results from impaired dopamine-modulated connectivity. We recorded the EEG in PD subjects off and on l-dopa medication performing simultaneous and unimanual tracking tasks. To deal with the inherent non-stationarity of the EEG during motor tasks, we segmented the data into task-related sections based on transient synchronisation between independent components of\u00a0the data, before assessing the mutual information (MI) between each EEG channel pair. In both tasks, PD\u00a0subjects off-medication demonstrated enhanced fronto-central and decreased occipital synchronisation within theta and alpha bands, and widespread increased beta-band synchronisation, compared to controls. Synchronisation changes in theta and beta bands were partially normalised by l-dopa, but l-dopa had relatively little effect on alpha band synchronisation. When comparing simultaneous movements to unimanual tracking, PD subjects off-medication demonstrated synchronisation changes within theta and beta bands, however alpha connectivity was largely unchanged. These results suggest that downstream influences of impaired basal ganglia function on cortico-cortical connectivity may result in difficulties with dual task performance in PD.",

The results from these 3 PGCs were compared with [11C]DAA1106 PET results from age-matched 9 healthy volunteers (HV), and with l-[\u03b2-11C]dopa and [11C]MP4A PET results from 10 HV. Values considered significant were more than 2 SDs greater or less than the normal control mean, as the number of subjects was small for group comparisons.Glial activities were increased in the frontal cortex of one PGC, the occipital cortex of two PGCs, and the posterior cingulate cortex of one PGC, although none of the PGCs showed overt glial activation in the brain. Only one of the PGCs showed reduced AChE activity in the temporo-parietal cortex. Three PGCs showed low dopamine synthesis rates in the putamen. Hippocampal atrophy was observed in two PGCs.Hippocampal atrophy and striatal dopaminergic dysfunction may be early disease processes in the pathogenesis of FTDP-17. Neuroinflammation may also be an in vivo signature of tau pathology at a prodromal stage, although current PET techniques may not constantly reveal it as the earliest neuroimaging abnormality.",

This study compared the correlation among two standard postural stability tests \u2013 the postural stability score on the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Functional Reach Test (FRT) \u2013 and ecologically valid reaching tasks that correspond to reaching at different cupboard heights among 20 individuals with PD and 20 age-matched controls. Both the FRT and the UPDRS postural stability tests are quick measures that can be performed during the clinical examination. The FRT, but not the postural stability score, demonstrated a significant correlation with the ecologically valid reaching tasks, among individuals with PD. Furthermore the FRT scores did not correlate with the UPDRS postural stability scores, indicating that these are measuring different aspects of balance. This study suggests that the FRT score may better predict the risk of postural instability encountered during daily activities among individuals with PD.",

II \u2013 I can drink with one hand, but I have to fill the glass with less liquid to avoid spills. III \u2013 I cannot drink with one hand, I need both hands. IV \u2013 I cannot drink with my hands, I need a straw. The score is followed by \u201cA\u201d if tremor involves only the upper limbs, and \u201cB\u201d if not. Construct validity of the Glass scale was tested against the Tremor Clinical Rating Scale (TCRS) and the Bain disability scale.

High inter-rater validity was also observed (w. kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.937).The Glass scale appears to be a reliable and valid tool to determine tremor severity in ET.

     "abstract": "Dementia is a common feature in Parkinson disease (PD), the time of onset determining how patients are classified. Those patients where dementia develops prior to parkinsonism or during the first year of disease are designated as having dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In those where dementia develops over a year after the onset of motor signs, the condition is known as Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD).While this seems at first sight to be a definitive way to distinguish these conditions, reality is rather different. The overlap between them is considerable, and there is much uncertainty associated with patients who have both motor symptoms and early cognitive impairment. The diagnosis is still based on medical history and clinical evaluation. It is not even certain that they can be accurately distinguished at autopsy. For this reason, the data concerning these entities have been reviewed, to examine various markers employed or measured in clinical, neuropathological, neuroimaging, and biochemical investigations. The concept of PDD and DLB being separate conditions is comparatively new, and the most promising tools with which to separate them at present are cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning that indicate increased amyloid-\u03b2 burden in DLB compared to PDD. However as yet there are no markers that unequivocally distinguish between PDD and DLB.",

     "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) are typically discharged from the hospital the day following deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery; however, factors extending hospital stay are largely unknown. This study examined potential factors that might have corresponded to increased post-operative stays following unilateral DBS surgery.A retrospective review was performed on 115 unilateral PD DBS patients. Age, gender, number of microelectrode passes, duration and severity of illness, and pre-operative neuropsychological scores were considered as possible contributors to length of stay.Most patients (79%) had a hospital stay of one day following surgery. The most frequent reasons for delayed discharge (>1\u00a0day) included mental status change (N\u00a0=\u00a06) and hemorrhage (N\u00a0=\u00a05). Those with delayed discharge had significantly lower pre-surgical cognitive screening scores (Mini-Mental State Evaluation; MMSE), higher pre-surgical \u201con\u201d medication motor score, and more microelectrode passes than those with immediate discharge. In correlation analyses, increasing length of hospital stay was significantly associated with more microelectrode passes, higher pre-surgical \u201con\u201d medication motor scores, and decreasing MMSE scores. When the significant variables from the preliminary analyses were entered into a Poisson regression model, a greater number of microelectrode passes as well as lower MMSE scores remained significant predictors of increased length of stay.The number of microelectrode passes utilized for DBS surgery as well as a patient's general cognitive status may be important factors related to extended hospital stay. UPDRS \u201con\u201d medication motor score may also provide some predictive power for immediate post-operative morbidity in unilateral DBS patients.",

No significant difference was found in the total concentrations of copper or iron in the whole substantia nigra between parkinsonian and control samples. M\u00f6ssbauer spectroscopy detected no Fe2+ in any samples.The substantia nigra of parkinsonian patients contained more labile iron compared with that of controls. This labile iron generated higher reactive oxygen species activity.

Previously, we failed to identify a relationship between the types of dopaminergic therapy and occurrence of ICDs in 33 PD patients. In this study, we aim to evaluate the outcome of ICD behaviors in the same patient group.Among 33 patients with ICDs, 22 patients were included. Demographics, dopaminergic therapy and disease severity were compared between two time points (Time 1: time of diagnosis of ICD, Time 2: last visit) and between patients who recovered from ICDs and with ongoing ICDs. Types of antipsychotic and antidepressant medication were noted.Mean follow-up period was 43.2 months. At Time 2 mean dopamine agonist (DA) dose was significantly lower, levodopa dose and total UPDRS score was significantly higher. ICDs were dissolved in 16 patients (73%), but persisted in six (27%). In ICD(+) subgroup, DA doses in Time 1 was found significantly higher than ICD(\u2212). However, age, PD severity, disease duration and levodopa dosage were similar. Fourteen patients were prescribed atypical antipsychotics and 13 antidepressants. In ICD(+) group, symptoms of ICDs were mainly increased libido and compulsive eating.Although we studied a small number of patients the recovery from compulsive behaviors may be associated with the decrease in DA dosage and increase in levodopa. Furthermore, majority were given antipsychotic and/or antidepressant drugs. It is difficult to speculate which strategy could be more effective on the improvement of ICDs in such a small group. In patients who were on high doses of DA, ICDs could be persistent.",

For monkeys, there were four groups: Normal, MPTP, STN-lesioned (+MPTP) and STN-DBS (+MPTP). For mice, BALB/c albino mice were divided into three groups, Saline, MPTP_50 (50\u00a0mg/kg), MPTP_100 (100\u00a0mg/kg). Animals were perfused transcardially with aldehyde fixative 6\u201312 days after their last MPTP injection. Brains were processed for immunochemistry and the number of cells was estimated using the optical fractionator method. Our results revealed significant reductions (25\u201330%) in TH+ cell number in the PAG of MPTP-treated monkeys and mice compared to controls. These reductions were not as substantial as those recorded in the SNc in the same animals (40\u201360%). Further, in monkeys, there were significantly more TH+ cells in the PAG of STN-lesioned and STN-DBS groups compared to the MPTP group. In fact, the number of TH+ cells in the STN alteration cases were similar to the Normal group. In summary, our results indicated that MPTP is toxic to TH+ cells in the PAG of monkeys and mice and that in monkeys, lesion or DBS of the STN offers neuroprotection against this toxicity.",

Therefore, we aimed to delineate the nature of subjective sleep disturbances and identify important correlates of sleep impairment in HD patients and premanifest mutation carriers.Using standardized questionnaires (including Epworth's Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, SCOPA-SLEEP, and Beck's Depression Inventory), daytime sleepiness, night-time sleep, and depressed mood were assessed in 63 HD patients, 21 premanifest mutation carriers and 84 controls.Night-time sleep impairment was significantly more prevalent in HD patients compared with controls (58.1% vs. 34.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012), but daytime sleepiness was not (12.7% vs. 7.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.560). Depression was the only independent correlate of night-time sleep impairment in HD patients, accounting for 10% of the variance. Compared with controls, both sleep onset latency and wake-up time were significantly delayed in HD patients. Moreover, in HD patients, later wake-up time was significantly associated with cognitive score (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.43), total functional capacity (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.54) and depressive symptoms (r\u00a0=\u00a0+0.47).

Studies investigating health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in Eastern European and Asian countries are scarce. The objective of this cross-sectional survey was to assess HRQoL in Russian patients with PD and identify its social and clinical determinants.The study included 100 outpatients with idiopathic PD and 100 controls. Patients were consecutively recruited from the neurological department of the Russian Medical State University in Moscow between October 2004 and December 2005. Regional healthy controls were matched for age and sex. The evaluation of HRQoL was performed using the EuroQol instrument (EQ-5D and EQ VAS). Disease severity was assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Multivariate regression analyses were used to identify independent determinants of HRQoL.HRQoL was more notably decreased in PD patients than in controls (98% versus 74% of individuals with moderate or severe problems in at least one dimension of the EQ-5D (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), respectively). As compared to patients, the controls reported a higher mean EQ VAS score (74.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.0 versus 47.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Thirteen RBD, 222 IPD and 50 controls underwent cardiac 123I-MIBG scintigraphy. Resulting heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) ratios were significantly lower in patients with RBD and IPD as compared to the control ratios. H/M ratios were lower for delayed than for early images in patients with RBD and IPD; whereas, the controls had higher ratios for delayed images. H/M ratios were significantly lower for patients with RBD than for those with IPD at Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 and 2. Disease duration did not differ between the two groups. Our study revealed that cardiac 123I-MIBG uptake was more markedly reduced in patients with RBD than in those with early stage IPD. RBD may not necessarily be a prodromal condition of IPD with respect to cardiac 123I-MIBG uptake results.",

Auditory P300 has previously been reported to be abnormal in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to investigate whether acute deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) itself can cause changes in the configuration of ERPs.Using a standard auditory oddball paradigm, we elicited ERPs in 10 patients with PD (in both DBS-ON and DBS-OFF conditions). The patients acted as their own controls. The N100, P200, N200 and P300 latencies, amplitudes and areas were compared between DBS-ON and DBS-OFF states. The motor reaction times were also recorded and compared between the two states.Comparison of the DBS-ON and DBS-OFF states revealed that neither amplitudes nor areas of the ERP components changed significantly; however, significant changes were observed in the latency of N100 potential when the target stimulus was applied, although there was no significant change in the latency of the P300 potential. No significant changes were noted in the latencies of the other observed ERP components. There was a marked improvement in the reaction time after the DBS electrode was turned ON.Our data indicate that DBS might have varied impacts on electrophysiological parameters during the auditory oddball paradigm. Moreover, it may also worsen the orientation response as reflected by the increase in the N100 latency after the DBS electrode is turned ON.",

This study investigated the relationships between leg extensor muscle power and strength with walking speed and past falls in people with PD.Forty people with mild to moderate PD were assessed. Walking velocity was measured over 10\u00a0m and the number of falls the participant reported having in the past 12 months was recorded. Leg extensor muscle power and strength were measured using a Keiser leg press machine.Muscle power explained more than half of the variance (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.54) in walking velocity and remained significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) associated with walking velocity in models which included Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores. Participants with low muscle power were 6 times more likely to report multiple falls in the past year than those with high muscle power (OR\u00a0=\u00a06.0, 95% CI 1.1 to 33.3), though this association between falls and power was no longer significant in models which included UPDRS motor scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09).Muscle power is a significant determinant of walking velocity in PD even after adjusting for UPDRS motor score.

Recent evidence suggests that RBD is associated with akinetic rigid disease type and increased frequency of falls. We wondered whether the presence of RBD would also influence the long-term outcome of STN-DBS.Forty-one consecutive PD patients treated with bilateral STN-DBS were assessed. The diagnosis of pRBD was based on a clinical interview investigating the occurrence of diagnostic criteria for RBD. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale was used to compare the on- and off-medication conditions preoperatively and the on-stimulation/on- and off-medication conditions 1 and 3 years postoperatively. The general linear model for multivariate measures was used to analyse the interaction of pRBD with STN-DBS outcome measures.pRBD was present in 12 out of 41 patients (29%) undergoing STN-DBS. Patients with pRBD had a significantly poorer outcome three years after STN-DBS compared to patients without pRBD, in particular for axial symptoms.Our findings suggest that the presence of pRBD in PD patients undergoing STN-DBS may be associated with a less favourable outcome and a more prominent development of axial symptoms over time.",

Pons area, midbrain area, medial cerebellar peduncle (MCP) width, and superior cerebellar peduncle width were measured using MRI. Poor quality sleep, risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and restless legs syndrome (RLS) were detected in all groups. Patients with MSA showed higher risk of OSA and less frequent RLS. In MSA, a correlation between PSQI scores and Hoehn and Yahr stage was observed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In PSP, RLS was frequent (57%) and related with reduced sleep duration and efficiency. In PD, excessive daytime sleepiness was related to atrophy of the MCP (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). RLS was more frequent in PD and PSP, and in PSP, was associated with reduced sleep efficiency and sleep duration. Brain morphometry abnormalities were found in connection with excessive daytime sleepiness and risk of OSA in PD and PSP suggesting widespread degeneration of brainstem sleep structures on the basis of sleep abnormalities in these patients.",

In addition, an occupational, residential, and environmental survey was administered to elucidate potential shared environmental risk factors.Eighteen married subjects had a clinical picture suggestive of idiopathic Parkinson disease. Average age of motor symptom onset was 66.1 (\u00b16.22) years in women, 63.4 (\u00b17.87) years in men. Subjects cohabitated an average of 39.9 years prior to motor symptom onset in the first affected spouse and an average of nine years elapsed prior to symptom onset in their partner.

Both groups decreased step length and step speed when performing a secondary task. Neither group showed changes of gait characteristics in steady state walking prior to stopping. For stopping trials, the number of steps, time, and distance taken to stop were compared for PwP and controls. In planned stops PwP used more steps and took a longer time to stop, but both groups stopped within a similar distance. A secondary motor task did not alter stopping distance or number of steps to stop, but stopping time increased in the comparisons.

     "abstract": "Psychogenic movement disorders (PMD) represent a diagnostically challenging group of patients in movement disorders. Finger tapping tests (FTT) have been used in neuropsychiatric evaluations to identify psychogenic conditions, but their use in movement disorders has been limited to the quantification of upper extremity disability in idiopathic Parkinson disease (IPD). We evaluated the ability of the FTT to objectively identify PMD by screening 195 individuals from a movement disorder clinic with IPD, dystonia, essential tremor, or PMD and compared them to 130 normal adults. All subjects performed six-30\u00a0s trials using alternate hands. We compared mean FTT score and the coefficient of variation between diagnostic groups. FTT scores in IPD were inversely correlated with Hoehn and Yahr stage (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III (motor) subscale (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). FTT scores were significantly lower in PMD (mean\u00a0=\u00a041.72) when compared to the other diagnostic groups after controlling for age. The coefficient of variation was not significantly different between diagnostic groups. ROC analysis identified a cutoff FTT ratio of 0.670 or less was 89.1% specific and 76.9% sensitive for the diagnosis of PMD. We conclude the FTT can provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis of PMD.",

The presence of ICRBs was screened using a modified version of the Minnesota Impulsive Disorders Interview that comprised five ICRB modules: compulsive buying, gambling, sexual behavior, eating, and punding. Data regarding the patients' clinical features and concurrent anti-PD drugs were also collected during the interview. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of the daily doses of dopamine agonist and l-dopa for the development of an ICRB were calculated after adjustment for clinical variables.Among the 1167 patients recruited, 118 (10.1%) exhibited ICRBs. Punding was the most common ICRB (4.2%), followed by compulsive eating (3.4%), sexual behaviors (2.8%), buying (2.5%), and gambling (1.3%). Two or more ICRBs were present concomitantly in 34 of these 118 patients (28.8%). There were dose\u2013response relationships between the dopamine agonist dose and the ORs for compulsive buying, gambling and sexual behaviors.

Subjects were classified as S-CBD if no differences had been observed between right- and left-sided cortical or extrapyramidal signs or symptoms. S-CBD cases were compared to 10 randomly selected typical CBS cases.Five cases (2 female) met criteria for S-CBD. None had limb dystonia, myoclonus, apraxia or alien limb phenomena. S-CBD cases had significantly less asymmetric atrophy when compared with CBS cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009); they were also younger at onset (median 61 versus 66 years, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and death (67 versus 73 years, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Procedures were performed by the same surgeon, and included DBS in 126 patients, ablation in 507 patients and DBS after prior unilateral ablation procedures in 11 patients. Of 796 target procedures, 207 were DBS including 202 subthalamic nucleus (STN) targets, 3 ventralis intermedius nucleus (Vim) targets and 2 globus pallidus internus (GPi)\u00a0targets, and the others were 589 ablation procedures including 474 GPi targets and 115 Vim targets. Postoperative CT or MRI was performed in all patients within 24\u00a0h of lead implantation or ablation treatment. Statistical correlation analysis of risk factors for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) was performed by stepwise logistic regression. Explanatory variables were patient age, sex, blood pressure, anatomical targets, the number of microelectrode recording (MER) penetrations and surgical modality.Postoperative symptomatic ICH occurred in 10 cases (8 pallidotomy and 2 thalamotomy) and asymptomatic ICH in 14 cases (9 pallidotomy, 4 thalamotomy and 1 DBS). Hypertension and surgical modality were significant factors contributing to hemorrhage (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The likelihood of hemorrhage in hypertensive patients was 2.5 times that in normotensive patients. The risk of hemorrhage during ablation was 5.4 times that in DBS. The number of MER trajectories did not significantly correlate with ICH occurrence (P\u00a0=\u00a00.07). No statistically significant difference was found in age, sex and anatomical targets.This study demonstrated that hypertension is a risk factor for ICH in PD patients. DBS is generally a safe surgical modality as compared with ablation. Increasing microelectrode trajectories seemed to increase the risk of ICH, but no statistically significant difference was found (P\u00a0=\u00a00.07).",

     "abstract": "Olfactory deficits are frequent among patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, apathy (as quantified by the Apathy Evaluation Scale), is more prevalent in PD patients compared to the general population. Olfactory impairment and apathy are associated with dysfunction in overlapping brain regions. Neuroimaging studies indicate that the anterior cingulate gyrus and medial orbitofrontal cortex are hypoactive in apathetic patients and are also involved in secondary olfactory processing. However, no study until this point has been published investigating whether there is any association between olfactory dysfunction and apathy in PD patients.In our study seventy consecutive patients with PD took the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT), completed the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) and were administered the Folstein Mini-Mental Status exam (MMSE).Apathetic PD patients performed poorly on the B-SIT compared with non-apathetic PD patients and olfactory impairment correlated with apathy. The simultaneous disruption of olfaction and emotion in Parkinson's could be the result of disease pathology in brain regions involved in both olfactory and emotional processing and reinforces the idea that this link between olfaction and emotions may have clinical consequences.",

We investigated the safety of TMS using simulation models with an implanted DBS device.The DBS lead was inserted into plastic phantoms filled with dilute gelatin showing impedance similar to that of human brain. TMS was performed with three different types of magnetic coil. During TMS (1) electrode movement, (2) temperature change around the lead, and (3) TMS-induced current in various situations were observed. The amplitude and area of each evoked current were measured to calculate charge density of the evoked current.There was no movement or temperature increase during 0.2\u00a0Hz repetitive TMS with 100% stimulus intensity for 1\u00a0h. The size of evoked current linearly increased with TMS intensity. The maximum charge density exceeded the safety limit of 30\u00a0\u03bcC/cm2/phase during stimulation above the loops of the lead with intensity over 50% using a figure-eight coil.Strong TMS on the looped DBS leads should not be administered to avoid electrical tissue injury. Subcutaneous lead position should be paid enough attention for forthcoming situations during surgery.",

ET cases (n\u00a0=\u00a0275, including 42 with rest tremor) and controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0289) were enrolled in an epidemiological study (Columbia University). Post-mortem brain tissue samples were obtained on 24 additional ET cases, including 3 with brainstem Lewy bodies. We performed a comprehensive analysis of the LRRK2 gene by genotyping 4 LRRK2 mutations (G2019S, I2020T, R1441C and Y1699C), 2 rare LRRK2 variants (L1114L and I1122V) and 19 LRRK2 SNPs. All GBA exons were sequenced in a subset of 93 Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) cases, 62 AJ controls and 24 ET brains. LRRK2 mutations were not found in any ET cases or ET brains and none of the LRRK2 SNPs was associated with ET. GBA mutations were found in 7.5% (7/93) of AJ ET cases and 4.8% (3/62) of AJ controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.75). 8.3% (2/24) of ET brains carried a GBA mutation. Four different heterozygous mutations were identified, including 3 previously reported mutations (N370S, R496H, and E326K) and 1 new missense variant (R44C). As suggested by several smaller prior reports, the known mutations for the LRRK2 gene are not risk factors for ET. Furthermore, a similar frequency of GBA mutations in AJ ET cases and controls suggests that GBA is not a common cause of ET either.",

In the present study of 10 patients with PD, 21 with MSA, 14 with PSP, 11 with corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and 59 healthy controls, this previous observation is confirmed and also extended to include CBD by showing that similarly high CSF NFL levels are seen not only in MSA and PSP but also in CBD. CSF levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a protein expressed mainly in fibrillary astrocytes, were similar in all investigated groups. In addition, consecutive analyses of CSF NFL and CSF GFAP levels showed relatively stable levels over time in all the investigated parkinsonian disorders, suggesting that the rate of neuronal degeneration is rather constant over time. Our results suggest that measurements of CSF NFL but not GFAP can be useful in the differential diagnosis of PD versus atypical parkinsonian disorders (APD).

MJD/SCA3 is caused by a CAG repeat expansion mutation in the protein coding region of the ATXN3 gene located at chromosome 14q32.1. Current hypotheses regarding pathogenesis favor the view that mutated ataxin-3, with its polyglutamine expansion, is prone to adopt an abnormal conformation, engage in altered protein\u2013protein interactions and aggregate. Expanded CAG repeat length correlates with the range and severity of the clinical manifestations and inversely correlates with age of disease onset. Though MJD/SCA3 is classically described as affecting the cerebellum, brainstem and basal ganglia, recent neuropathology and neuroimaging series demonstrate involvement of other areas such as the thalamus and cerebral cortex. Clinically, much emphasis has been placed in the description and recognition of the non-motor symptoms observed in these patients, such as pain, cramps, fatigue and depression. Currently, no disease modifying treatment exists for MJD/SCA3. Standard of care includes genetic counseling, exercise/physical therapy programs, and speech and swallow evaluation. Symptomatic treatment for clinical findings such as depression, sleep disorders, parkinsonism, dystonia, cramps, and pain is important to improve the quality of life for those with MJD/SCA3.",

Twenty-eight genetic subtypes have been identified, of which 7 are caused by expansion of a CAG trinucleotide repeat that encodes a polyglutamine tract in the respective proteins. SCA17 is caused by a CAG/CAA repeat expansion in the TATA box-binding protein-gene (TBP). In some cases the clinical phenotype of SCA17 overlaps that of Huntington's disease (HD), hence the use of the term Huntington's disease-like. We screened 89 patients with a Huntington's disease-like phenotype without the HD-gene mutation and 178 patients with genetically unclassified cerebellar ataxia for the mutation in TBP. A 33-year old woman presenting with an HD like phenotype with a de novo 54 CAG/CAA repeat expansion was identified. Her normal allele included 38 repeats. The patient's mother and father both carried normal range repeats, 38/38 and 33/39 respectively. Analysis of the repeat structures revealed that the expansion had occurred upon expansion of the longer paternal allele. We conclude that, however rare, SCA17 must be considered as a cause of Huntington's disease-like phenotypes and ataxia syndromes, also in isolated cases.",

The principal aim of the study was to address this issue. Twenty-five non-demented PD patients and 24 demographically-matched controls were administered BADS and other commonly used executive tools. Comparisons between groups indicated that two of the six BADS subtests (Temporal Judgement and Action Program) did not have sufficient sensitivity to executive impairments. However, when we explored group-predictive capabilities among the tests, the BADS total score was the most sensitive, followed by the Tower of London (TOL). We obtained similar results when we disentangled the sensitivity of the six BADS subtests. The BADS Six Elements task was the best group predictor followed by the TOL.Our findings showed that BADS is more sensitive to executive dysfunction than some of the tools commonly used to assess this construct in PD. However, we also demonstrated that, to assess executive impairments in PD without dementia adequately, this battery should be administered in combination with the TOL.",

Health-economic data were collected using a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach. Costs were calculated from the societal perspective and the human capital approach was used to estimate indirect costs. Czech currency was converted into 2004 Euros (EUR) and inflated to 2008 prices. Independent cost-driving factors were identified in multivariate regression analysis.Total semi-annual costs of PD were EUR 5510 (95% CI: 4470\u20137090) per patient. Direct costs accounted for 60% of the total costs and indirect costs for 40%. Patients' expenditures accounted for 40% of their income. Independent cost-driving factors included disease severity, motor complications, psychosis and age. In conclusion, our study demonstrates a considerable economic burden of PD in the Czech Republic. Total costs are generally lower than in Western Europe but the proportion of costs that fall on patients is higher because of lower incomes. More intensive government support for patients with chronic diseases such as PD and the development of disease-management programs that incorporate both the clinical and economic effects of PD treatment are needed.",

     "abstract": "[11C]-PK11195 PET has been used for in vivo brain imaging of microglia activation in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. COX-2 inhibition has been shown to reduce neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in animal models of PD. This pilot study assessed the use of [11C]-PK11195 PET to quantify neuroinflammation and evaluate the ability of COX-2 inhibition to reduce neuroinflammation in PD patients.Fourteen PD patients and eight healthy, age matched controls underwent a [11C]-PK11195 PET and MRI scan. Five PD patients were scanned before and after one month of celecoxib treatment 200\u00a0mg/day. Arterial plasma sampling and metabolite analysis were performed to create plasma input curves. A\u00a02-compartment model and Logan analysis were applied and parametric DV images were compared using t-test in SPM2. In addition a simplified reference region model (SRTM) was applied, with both the cerebellum and a reference region derived from cluster analysis.Using the cluster analysis, PD patients showed higher contralateral putamen BP and midbrain BP compared to controls, although considerable overlap was seen and differences were not statistically significant. Unexpectedly, BP and DV after celecoxib were slightly higher. Cerebellum as reference region resulted in lower BP values and k3/k4 gave 10-fold higher BP values. Linearization of the data did not show differences between PD patients and controls.In current practice, [11C]-PK11195 seems an unsuitable tracer for accurate or reliable quantification of neuroinflammation. Refinement of [11C]-PK11195 uptake analysis and, more importantly, further development of better tracers is necessary to enable accurate measurement of neuroinflammation and effects of anti-inflammatory treatment in patients.",

     "abstract": "Little is known about research participants' understanding of consent information over the course of a clinical study and the relationship of this information with participant behavior.We conducted a cross sectional patient completed questionnaire of comprehension and satisfaction administered at the end of a Parkinson's disease clinical trial.Scores on 9 comprehension items in a 30 item questionnaire covering the key elements of informed consent.78% of eligible trial participants completed this substudy. Greater than 90% of respondents showed good comprehension of the study purpose, method of treatment assignment, experimental nature of drugs, voluntary participation, and expected effect of the trial on their PD. However, 42.3% of subjects incorrectly endorsed that participating in the study was part of the \u201cusual treatment\u201d for their PD. We found no relationship between comprehension, compliance, and satisfaction with whether or not one's own neurologist was also the study doctor. Years of education and cognitive function at baseline were correlated with comprehension of study information.Overall comprehension of key study information presented in the consent was high after 12 months of trial participation, although there were inconsistencies in responses that need further study.",

     "abstract": "The present paper was aimed at investigating the effect of low-frequency electrical stimulation (25\u00a0Hz) of the peduncolopontine (PPN) area on working memory (WM) functioning in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Five PD patients who underwent simultaneous PPN area- and subthalamic nucleus-deep brain stimulation (DBS) implantation participated in the study. PD patients were evaluated in the morning at least 12\u00a0h after antiparkinsonian therapy withdrawal in two conditions: i) after continuous PPN area stimulation (Off Therapy/On PPN: \u201cOn\u201d condition); ii) at least 120\u00a0min after PPN area had been switched \u201cOff\u201d (Off Ther/Off PPN: \u201cOff\u201d condition). The experimental WM task consisted of an n-back paradigm with verbal and visual-object stimuli. PD patients showed a consistent response time decrease on both the verbal and the visual-object tasks passing from the \u201cOff\u201d to the \u201cOn\u201d condition (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, the accuracy score did not significantly differ between the two experimental conditions.The present findings, although preliminary, suggest that PPN area stimulation facilitates the speed processing of information in the content of WM, possibly through the modulation of the attentional resources.",

     "abstract": "We report transcranial sonography findings in two siblings (one male and one female) of a proband with Perry syndrome. A moderate degree of parkinsonism and prominent apathy were present in both subjects. The female patient displayed dyspnea and weight loss, indicating more advanced stages of Perry syndrome and for whom recently discovered specific mutation of Perry syndrome had been identified. In both patients, transcranial sonography exhibited marked substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity, which is characteristic of idiopathic Parkinson's disease. This observation, together with similar findings reported for several different types of monogenic forms of parkinsonism, supports the suggestions that SN hyperechogenicity may be a common sign of nigral degeneration irrespective of underlying molecular pathology.",
