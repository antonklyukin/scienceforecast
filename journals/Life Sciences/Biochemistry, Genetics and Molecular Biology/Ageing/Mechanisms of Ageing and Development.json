     "abstract": "The proportion of the population over the age of 65 is growing the most rapidly due to the longevity revolution. Frailty is prevalent in this age group and strongly associated with disability and hospitalization, having a significant impact on the costs of health and social care. New effective interventions to delay or reverse frailty are urgently required. Geroprotectors are a new class of drugs, which target fundamental mechanisms of ageing and show promise in delaying the onset of or boosting resilience in frail older people. However, there are challenges to their clinical translation. Here we review the literature for evidence that frailty can be delayed or reversed and geroprotectors can improve frailty in murine models and in patients. We will then discuss the challenges, which make their clinical testing complex and propose potential options for moving forward.",

     "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that increases in prevalence with advanced age. While a multitude of factors contribute to the development of OA, ageing has been implicated as a major driving force leading to an inability of the joint to repair itself and maintain normal health. In aged individuals, changes in joint cellular composition and signalling mechanisms have been observed which could lead to the development of degenerative joint disease. Senescent cells found in both aged and OA joints release senescent-associated mediators which can destroy articular tissues. These changes in addition to the chronic pro-inflammatory environment associated with ageing may hinder the ability of the joint to repair culminating in OA. We hypothesise that frailty may also drive OA development by creating an inflammatory environment that can interfere with normal tissue health. The molecular and biochemical changes associated with OA may in turn promote frailty resulting in an exorable deterioration of the joint. Frailty may therefore be considered an additional risk factor for the development of OA.",

     "abstract": "Heterogeneity in aging can be explained by frailty. Lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity can help manage frailty levels. Conversely, sedentary behaviours are associated with frailty independently of physical activity. Here, we summarize epidemiological and clinical trial evidence concerning the impact of physical activity and sedentary behaviors on frailty levels. We also analysed the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to describe physical activity and sedentary behavior accumulation patterns across frailty levels and their impact on mortality risk. The few prospective and intervention studies demonstrate that higher physical activity levels are associated with a lower incidence of frailty. There are no interventions published which limit sedentary behaviors to manage frailty. Using the NHANES data we demonstrate that individuals are less likely to meet physical activity guidelines and are more likely to accumulate sedentary time in prolonged bouts. Prolonged sedentary bouts and total sedentary time were associated with a higher mortality risk in frail individuals but not in the fit group. Non-bouted sedentary time was not associated with mortality risk. Our review and novel data suggest that there is a need for more intervention studies which focus on increasing physical activity or minimizing sedentary time to manage frailty levels.",

     "abstract": "Although survival has been the focus of aging research for many years, the field is rapidly evolving towards incorporating healthspan and health indices in studies that explore aging-related outcomes. Frailty is one such measure that is tightly correlated with human aging. Several frailty measures have been developed that focus on phenotypes of aging, including physical, cognitive and metabolic health that define healthspan. The extent at which cumulative deficits associated with frailty predict functional characteristics of healthy aging and longevity is currently unknown. A growing consensus for the use of animal models has emerged to evaluate a composite measure of frailty that provides a translational basis to understanding human frailty. In this review, we will focus on the impact of several anti-aging interventions, some of which have been characterized as caloric restriction (CR) mimetics such as metformin, rapamycin, and resveratrol as well as more novel approaches that are emerging in the field - nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide precursors, small molecule activators of sirtuins, and senolytics - on a number of frailty measurements associated with aging-related outcomes in mice and discuss the translatability of such measures to human frailty.",

High intensity interval training (HIIT), which couples bursts of vigorous activity interspersed with active recovery intervals, shows promise for the treatment of frailty. Here we compare and contrast five Fried physical phenotype and one deficit accumulation based mouse frailty assessment tools for identifying the impacts of HIIT on frailty and predicting functional capacity, underlying pathology, and survival in aged female mice. Our data reveal a 10-minute HIIT regimen administered 3-days-a-week for 8-weeks increased treadmill endurance, gait speed and maintained grip strength. One frailty tool identified a benefit of HIIT for frailty, but many were trending suggesting HIIT was beneficial for physical performance in these mice, but the 8-week timeframe may have been insufficient to induce frailty benefits. Finally, most frailty tools distinguished between surviving or non-surviving mice, whereas half correlated with functional capacity measured by nest building ability, and none correlated with underlying pathology. In summary, this study supports the ongoing development of mouse assessment tools as useful instruments for frailty research.",

In an approach to develop a first mouse model for therapy-induced long-term frailty, we irradiated male C57Bl/6 mice at 5\u20136 months of age sub-lethally with 3\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009Gy (whole body) and assessed subsequent frailty for up to 6 months using a Rockwood-type frailty index (FI). Frailty scorers were trained to obtain excellent inter- and intra-observer reproducibility. Irradiated mice developed progressive frailty approximately twice as fast as controls. This was premature frailty; it was phenotypically identical to that in non-irradiated mice at higher age. As expected, frailty was associated with decreased cognition and predicted mortality. In irradiated mice, frailty and neuromuscular performance, measured by Rotarod and Hanging Wire tests, were not associated with each other, probably because of long-term decreased body weights after irradiation. We conclude that progressive frailty following sub-lethal irradiation comprises a sensitive and easy to use test bed for interventions to stop premature ageing in long-term tumour survivors.",

In women, miR-146a circulating levels showed negative correlations with azotemia, uric acid, waist/hip ratio and ferritin. A significant miR-146a decline with aging was also observed in T2DM patients. Significant positive correlations were found between miR-146a in diabetic patients and total cholesterol, LDL-C, ApoA1, ApoB, and platelets, and negative correlations with serum iron and ferritin. Notably, miR-146a was significantly overexpressed in T2DM patients treated with metformin. MiR-146a levels were significantly lower in diabetic patients than in age-matched CTR and negatively correlated to both fasting glucose and HbA1c in males. Finally, age-related trajectories for circulating miR-146a levels showed an inverted U-shaped relationship; however, in T2DM patients the trajectory was significantly shifted towards lower levels.

     "abstract": "In replicative senescence, cells with critically-short telomeres activate a DNA-damage response leading to cell-cycle arrest, while those without telomere dysfunction would be expected to cycle normally. However, population growth declines more gradually than such a simple binary switch between cycling and non-cycling states would predict. We show here that late-passage cultures of human fibroblasts are not a simple mixture of cycling and non-cycling cells. Rather, although some cells had short cycle times comparable to those of younger cells, others continued to divide but with greatly extended cycle times, indicating a more-gradual approach to permanent arrest. Remarkably, in late passage cells, the majority showed prominent DNA-damage foci positive for 53BP1, yet many continued to divide. Evidently, the DNA-damage-response elicited by critically-short telomeres is not initially strong enough for complete cell-cycle arrest. A similar continuation of the cell cycle in the face of an active DNA-damage response was also seen in cells treated with a low dose of doxorubicin sufficient to produce multiple 53BP1 foci in all nuclei. Cell cycle checkpoint engagement in response to DNA damage is thus weaker than generally supposed, explaining why an accumulation of dysfunctional telomeres is needed before marked cell cycle elongation or permanent arrest is achieved.",

Our comparative analysis resulted in higher biodiversity within Ruminococcaceae in centenarians, with respect to younger adults, irrespective of their nationality. We observed bacterial signatures that are common among extremely old people of different nationality. Comparative metabolites profiling identified the fecal metabolic signature of extreme aging in the Indian study population.

Four brain structures were compared: hippocampus, striatum, parietal cortex, cerebellum. Our CR diet elicits significant prevention of oxidative damages with the upregulation of antioxidant defenses (levels of glutathione [GSH], mRNAs of clusterin and of three key antioxidant enzymes) as compared to age-matched AL controls, in a strikingly region-specific pattern. CR also prevented a drastic rise of the glial fibrillary acidic protein in the hippocampus of old AL rats. Besides, the CR effects at age 19 months mainly consist in improving endogenous defenses before the onset of age-related redox alterations. These effects are more prominent in the hippocampus.",

Frailty is an important challenge because the loss of physiological reserve means that even minor stressors can lead to disability and death in those who are frail.

These pre-clinical models are based on \u201creverse-translation\u201d. Investigators have adapted either the \u201cfrailty phenotype\u201d approach or the \u201cfrailty index\u201d approach, originally developed in humans, for use in animals. This review briefly describes rodent models of frailty, discusses how these models have been used to explore mechanisms of frailty and how they have been employed to assess the impact of frailty on various experimental outcomes. The review also highlights studies that have used rodent models to investigate interventions to attenuate frailty, including drug treatment, dietary modifications and exercise. The ability to model frailty in animals is an exciting development that promises to accelerate the translation of laboratory discoveries into new clinical interventions, and situates frailty research in the larger context of geroscience.",

According to the pooled results, the G allele of the G-395\u2009A polymorphism conferred a significantly higher risk of urolithiasis; G-395\u2009A was related to the susceptibility to cardiovascular disease under allele, dominant, and recessive models. There was no significant association between the G-395\u2009A polymorphism and cognitive impairment among the elderly.

     "abstract": "From a biological point of view, aging can be considered a progressive inability of an organism to react to stress, maintain homeostasis, and survive unfavourable changes during post-maturational life. The expression of several adipokines changes during aging and for some changes, a role in the onset of chronic disease and frailty has been proposed. Among adipokines, resistin was shown in recent studies to play a key role in aging.Resistin is a small secreted protein that regulates glucose metabolism in mammalians. High resistin levels induce insulin resistance and exert proinflammatory effects. Consistently, resistin has been shown to play a pivotal role in various metabolic, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases.Herein, the role of resistin as a molecular link between aging and age-related conditions was reviewed and the clinical implications of this knowledge discussed.",

AGEs accumulate over time and are responsible for various age-dependent diseases and impairments. Two very potent dicarbonyls to generate AGEs are glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal (MGO). The plasma level of such dicarbonyls is higher in aging and age-related diseases. Natural killer (NK) cells are cells of the innate immune system and provide a major defense against tumor cells and virus infected cells. They are able to kill modified or infected cells and produce different cytokines to modulate the function of other immune cells. Here we investigated the effect of GO- and MGO-induced glycation on the function of NK cells. Using the human NK cell line NK-92, we could demonstrate that both GO and MGO lead to glycation of cellular proteins, but that MGO interferes much stronger with NK cell function (cytotoxicity) than GO. In addition, glycation of NK cell targets, such as K562 tumor cells, also interferes with their lysis by NK cells. From this data we conclude that glycation acts negatively on NK cells function and reduces their cytotoxic potential towards tumor cells.",

Under neurodegenerative condition such as in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), tau-microtubule binding dynamics and equilibrium are severely affected due to its aberrant post-translational modifications including acetylation and hyperphosphorylation. This event results in its conformational changes to form neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) after aggregation in the cytosol. The formation of NFT is more strongly correlated with cognitive decline than the distribution of senile plaque, which is formed by polymorphous beta-amyloid (A\u03b2) protein deposits, another pathological hallmark of AD. In neurodegenerative conditions, other than AD, the disease manifestation is correlated with mutations of the MAPT gene. In Primary age-related tauopathy (PART), which is commonly observed in the brains of aged individuals, tau deposition is directly correlated with cognitive deficits even in the absence of A\u03b2 deposition. Thus, tauopathy has been considered as an essential hallmark in neurodegeneration and normal brain aging. In this review, we highlighted the recent progress about the tauopathies in the light of its posttranslational modifications and its implication in AD and the aged brain.",

     "abstract": "FAHD1, a member of the FAH superfamily of enzymes, was identified in a proteomic screen for mitochondrial proteins with differential expression in young versus senescent human endothelial cells. FAHD1 acts as oxaloacetate decarboxylase, and recent observations suggest that FAHD1 plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial function. Thus, mutation of the nematode homolog, fahd-1, impairs mitochondrial function in Caenorhabditis elegans. When FAHD1 gene expression was silenced in human cells, activity of the mitochondrial electron transport (ETC) system was reduced and the cells entered premature senescence-like growth arrest. These findings suggest a model where FAHD1 regulates mitochondrial function and in consequence senescence. These findings are discussed here in the context of a new concept where senescence is divided into deep senescence and less severe forms of senescence. We propose that genetic inactivation of FAHD1 in human cells induces a specific form of cellular senescence, which we term senescence light and discuss it in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction associated senescence (MiDAS) described by others. Together these findings suggest the existence of a continuum of cellular senescence phenotypes, which may be at least in part reversible.",

In this work, we show that SOX2 expression decreases significantly in the brain with ageing, in both humans and rodents. The administration of resveratrol for 6 months in mice partly attenuated this reduction. We also identified an age-related decline in SOX2 mRNA and protein expression in several other organs, namely, the lung, heart, kidney, spleen and liver. Moreover, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from elderly expressed lower levels of SOX2 than those from young individuals. Mechanistically, SOX2 expression inversely correlates with p16Ink4a levels.

Critically short telomeres trigger cellular senescence in normal cells, or genomic instability in pre-malignant cells, which contribute to numerous degenerative and aging-related diseases including cancer. Therefore, a detailed understanding of the mechanisms of telomere loss and preservation is important for human health. Numerous studies have shown that oxidative stress is associated with accelerated telomere shortening and dysfunction. Oxidative stress caused by inflammation, intrinsic cell factors or environmental exposures, contributes to the pathogenesis of many degenerative diseases and cancer. Here we review the studies demonstrating associations between oxidative stress and accelerated telomere attrition in human tissue, mice and cell culture, and discuss possible mechanisms and cellular pathways that protect telomeres from oxidative damage.",

A decline of protein degradation during aging results in the formation of oxidatively damaged and aggregated proteins finally resulting in failure of cellular functionality. Besides protein aggregation in response to oxidative damage, amyloids are a different type of protein aggregates able to distract proteostasis and interfere with cellular functionality. Amyloids are clearly linked to the pathogenesis of age-related degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Human amylin is one of the peptides forming fibrils in \u03b2-sheet conformation finally leading to amyloid formation. In contrast to rodent amylin, human amylin is prone to form amyloidogenic aggregates, proposed to play a role in the pathogenesis of Type 2 Diabetes by impairing \u03b2-cell functionality. Since aggregates such as lipofuscin and \u03b2-amyloid are known to impair proteostasis, it is likely to assume similar effects for human amylin.

As the fifth class of histone proteins the linker histones not only interact with DNA and core histones but also with other chromatin proteins.

Our recent results have proved that Saccharomyces cerevisiae linker histone \u2013 Hho1p, physically interacts with the actin-related protein 4 (Arp4) and that the abrogation of this interaction through the deletion of the gene for the linker histone in arp4 mutant cells leads to global changes in chromatin compaction. Here, we show that the healthy interaction between the yeast linker histone and Arp4p is critical for maintaining genome stability and for controlling cellular sensitivity to different types of stress. The abolished interaction between the linker histone and Arp4p leads the mutant yeast cells to premature ageing phenotypes. Cells die young and are more sensitive to stress. These results unambiguously prove the role of linker histones and chromatin remodelling in ageing by their cooperation in pertaining higher-order chromatin compaction and thus maintaining genome stability.",

Several factors have been identified as causes of aging to elucidate the decline in functions. Various aspects of physiological deterioration are controlled by the hypothalamus, a critical brain region that connects the neuroendocrine system to physiological functions. In addition, functional alterations in a set of agouti-related peptide/neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY) and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, a set of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and somatostatin (SST) neurons, a set of arginine vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) neurons, and a set of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin (KNDy) neurons contribute to age-related physiological decline in energy metabolism, hormone regulation, circadian rhythm, and reproduction, respectively. The underlying cellular mechanism for the hypothalamus-mediated aging progression comprises dysregulation of nutrient sensing, altered intercellular communication, stem cell exhaustion, loss of proteostasis, and epigenetic alterations. Furthermore, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), NF-kB, hypothalamic stem cell, autophagy, and SIRT1 have been recognized as critical factors or pathways mediating the mechanism. Perhaps, further dissection of these pathways or components could provide the potential for developing a therapeutic intervention for age-related diseases or the extension of healthy lifespan.",

Multiple markers of ageing have been identified, including loss of protein homeostasis, increased inflammation, and declining metabolism.

To address this gap, we outline the age-associated consequences of dysregulation of \u2018Adaptive Homeostasis\u2019 and its proposed contributing role as an accelerator of the ageing phenotype. Adaptive Homeostasis is a phenomenon, shared across cells and tissues of both simple and complex organisms, that enables the transient plastic expansion or contraction of the homeostatic range to modulate stress-protective systems (such as the Proteasome, the Immunoproteasome, and the Lon protease) in response to varying internal and external environments. The age-related rise in the baseline of stress-protective systems and the inability to increase beyond a physiological ceiling is likely a contributor to the reduction and loss of Adaptive Homeostasis. We propose that dysregulation of Adaptive Homeostasis in the final third of lifespan is a significant factor in the ageing process, while successful maintenance of Adaptive Homeostasis below a physiological ceiling results in extended longevity.",

In our previous work we identified frailty and loss of resilience as a potential target for geroprotectors. Frailty is the result of an accumulation of deficits, which occurs with age and reduces the ability to respond to adverse events (physical resilience). Modelling frailty and physical resilience in mice is challenging for many reasons. There is no consensus on the precise definition of frailty and resilience in patients or on how best to measure it. This makes it difficult to evaluate available mouse models. In addition, the characterization of those models is poor. Here we review potential models of physical resilience, focusing on those where there is some evidence that the administration of acute stressors requires integrative responses involving multiple tissues and where aged mice showed a delayed recovery or a worse outcome then young mice in response to the stressor.

In this manuscript we describe an initial exploration where a set of in vivo imaging based subject-specific technologies originally developed to predict the risk of femoral strength and hip fracture in osteoporotic patients, were adapted to assess the efficacy of bone drugs pre-clinically on mice. The CT2S technology we developed generates subject-specific models based on Computed Tomography that can separate fractured and non-fractured patients with an accuracy of 82%. When used in mouse experiments the use of in vivo imaging and modelling was found to improve the reproducibility of Bone Mineral Content measurements to a point where up to 63% less mice would be required to achieve the same statistical power of a conventional cross-sectional study.

It is believed that when a subset of chromosomes reach a critically short length, an ATM-initiated and p53-mediated transcriptional response inhibits cell growth, promoting cell senescence. In addition to loss of telomeric sequence, senescence can be induced by other stresses including ionizing radiation, oxidative damage, chemical crosslinkers like the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin, as well as overactivation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Our group found that the expression of an isoform of the INhibitor of Growth 1 gene called ING1a increases approximately 10-fold as fibroblasts approach senescence and that forced expression rapidly induces a senescent phenotype in primary diploid fibroblasts, epithelial and endothelial cells that resembles replicative senescence by most physical and biochemical measures. ING1a induces these changes through strongly inhibiting endocytosis to block mitogen signaling by inducing the expression of intersectin 2, a key scaffolding protein of the endosomal pathway. This, in turn increases the expression of Rb and of p57Kip2 and p16INK4a that serve to maintain Rb is an active, growth inhibitory state.

Here we showed that a combination of low glucose, hypoxia, high osmolality and absence of serum is anti-proliferative for young disc cells. In addition, we demonstrated for the first time that classical senescence markers, namely p16INK4a, p21WAF1 and ICAM-1, remain up-regulated in senescent cells under these conditions. Finally, up-regulation of the main senescence-associated ECM degrading enzymes, i.e. MMP-1, -2 and -3 was maintained in this strict environment. Conservation of IVD cells\u2019 senescent phenotype under the actual conditions these cells are confronted with in vivo further supports their possible implication in IDD.",

The rate of ageing differs between individuals of the same chronological age, meaning that \u2018biological age\u2019 of a person may be different from \u2018chronological age\u2019. Furthermore, ageing represents a very potent risk factor for diseases and disability in humans. Therefore, establishment of markers of biological ageing is important for preventing age-associated diseases and extending health span. MARK-AGE, a large-scale European study, aimed at identifying a set of biomarkers which, as a combination of parameters with appropriate weighting, would measure biological age better than any marker in isolation. But beyond the identification of useful biomarkers, MARK-AGE provided new insights in age-associated specific cellular processes, such as DNA methylation, oxidative stress and the regulation of zinc homeostasis.",

To prevent frailty, we need a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms and early detection of individuals at risk.

We used univariate (Rank-ANOVA) and multivariate (elastic net) approaches on the RASIG study population (age range: 35\u201374 years, n\u202f=\u202f2220) of the MARK-AGE study to study up to 331 (bio)markers between individuals with and without frailty for each domain. Biomarkers and markers identified by both approaches were studied further regarding their association with frailty using logistic regression. Univariately, we found lower levels of antioxidants, including \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin, in those who were physically, cognitively or psychologically frail. Additionally, self-reported health was worse in these three frail groups. Multivariately, we observed lower levels of \u03b2-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin in the cognitively frail. Levels of these carotenoids were inversely associated with the risk of being cognitively frail after adjusting for confounders. Antioxidants and self-reported health are potential (bio)markers to detect persons at risk of becoming frail. The biomarkers identified may indicate the involvement of inflammation in frailty, especially for physical and cognitive frailty.",

Notably, analysis focused on Fp identified significant transcriptional signatures associated with ageing, which included transcripts related to extracellular matrix, focal adhesion points, and cytoskeleton, thus suggesting functional consequences on tissue structure. At a cellular level, an increased contractility was identified as a property of aged Fp. Accordingly, further investigations were conducted on the KN motif and ankyrin repeat-containing protein 4 (KANK4) to explore its possible function as an original effector involved in the acquisition of aged properties in Fp, notably their increased contractility. We show that KANK4 down-modulation using siRNA led to increased Rho pathway activity, thereby reducing their contractility. As a proof-of-principle, the present study shows that targeting KANK4 was efficient to attenuate aged Fp characteristics.",

We demonstrate that oenocyte-specific reduction of desaturase activity is sufficient to dramatically alter the composition of the hydrocarbon mix displayed by the flies. In addition, flies with altered desaturase activity display changes in fecundity and stereotypical mating behavior, and, importantly, extended longevity.

Enzymes involved in homocysteine metabolism also take part in H2S production and hence, in this study, the impact of MR on hyperhomocysteinemia and H2S production capacity were investigated using Fischer-344 rats assigned either a control or a MR diet for 8 weeks. The MR animals showed elevated plasma homocysteine accompanied with a reduction in liver cysteine content and methylation potential. It was further found that MR decreased cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (CBS) activity in the liver, however, MR increased hepatic cystathionine-\u03b3-lyase (CGL) activity which is the second enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway and also participates in regulating H2S production. The relative contribution of CGL in H2S production increased concomitantly with the increased CGL activity. Additionally, hepatic mercaptopyruvate-sulphur-transferase (MPST) activity also increased in response to MR. Taken together, our results suggest that reduced CBS activity and S-Adenosylmethionine availability contributes to hyperhomocysteinimia in MR animals.

Cell division asymmetry is an important source of microbial phenotypic heterogeneity. A consecutive set of asymmetric divisions can cause the gradual accumulation of deleterious factors and, at late stages, the death of old pole (mother) cells. This phenomenon is known as replicative aging. As the old cells are constantly being diluted by the progeny, the majority of a microbial population is represented by replicatively young cells. Therefore, early-age changes in yeast mother cells have a much greater impact on the integral performance of the microbial population than does functional deterioration at later ages. Here, we review the early manifestations of replicative aging in Saccharomyces cerevisiae mother cells that occur during the first ten cell cycles. Early age-dependent changes occur in stress resistance, genomic instability, protein aggregate levels, redox balance and metabolism. We speculate that some of these manifestations can be beneficial during stress exposure; therefore, early aging may be a bet-hedging mechanism. Together, the data suggest that the age component of variation in populations of asymmetrically dividing microorganisms is substantial and may play an important role in adaptations to changing environments.",

Our primary goal was to provide an updated review about the main neural and musculotendinous mechanisms underpinning age-related reductions in force capacity.

This review suggests that several steps in the force production pathway, from cortical to muscular mechanisms, are negatively affected by ageing. However, combining aerobic and strength training can attenuate these effects. Strength training (i.e. moderate to high- intensity, progressive volume, accentuated eccentric loading and fast concentric contraction velocity) can increase overall force production capacity by producing beneficial neural and musculotendinous adaptations. Additionally, aerobic training (i.e. moderate and high intensities) plays an essential role in preserving the structure and function of the neuromuscular system.",

Autophagy could eliminate redundant production of ROS in aging stem cells and helps to maintain the proliferation capacity by restraining the expression of p16INK4a. Current studies showed that improving autophagy could restore the regenerative ability of aging stem cells. Therefore, it is important for an organism to maintain the appropriate autophagy.

     "abstract": "Developments in medicine have led to a significant increase in the average human lifespan. This increase in aging is most readily apparent in the case of HIV where antiretroviral therapy has shifted infection from a terminal to a chronic but manageable disease. Despite this advance, patients suffer from co-morbidities best described as an accelerated aging phenotype. A potential contributor is cellular senescence, an aging-associated growth arrest, which has already been linked to other HIV co-morbidities such as lipodystrophies and osteoporosis in response to antiretroviral drugs. We have previously demonstrated that astrocytes senescence in response to antiretroviral drugs. As endothelial cells play a critical role regulating the blood brain barrier (BBB) and senescence could severely impact barrier permeability, we investigate the role of a commonly used combination of HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors on the senescence program of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Our studies indicate that HUVECs underwent premature senescence associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and altered eNOS activation. Treated cells had detrimental paracrine effects on astrocytes including paracrine senescence, suggesting that senescent HUVECs could influence astrocytes, which line the other side of the BBB. These results may have implications for HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), a set of neurological deficits.",

     "abstract": "In older adults, the prevalence of osteoarthritis (OA) increases directly with age and is the most common cause of chronic disability. It is necessary to recognize that OA is a degenerative disease that strongly correlates with age, and often promotes elevated levels of cartilage injury. Chondrocytes undergo an age-dependent decline in proliferative and synthetic capacity. It is thought that cellular senescence may play a significant role in the pathology of OA, with chondrocytes exhibiting a variety of senescence-associated phenotypes. In this review, we discuss cellular senescence and its relationship with OA. More importantly, we introduce novel strategies for the modulation of cellular senescence, including the use of sirtuin 6, mammalian target of rapamycin, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, proteoglycan-4 and senolytic, which may help to delay senescence and improve cartilage regeneration in the aging population.",

However, the epigenetic memory of a cell remains a challenge facing the current reprograming methods and does not allow transcription factors to bind properly. Because somatic cells can be reprogramed by transferring their nuclear contents into oocytes, introducing specific oocyte factors into differentiated cells is considered a promising approach for mimicking the reprograming process that occurs during fertilization. Mammalian metaphase II oocyte possesses a superior capacity to epigenetically reprogram somatic cell nuclei towards an embryonic stem cell-like state than the current factor-based reprograming approaches. This may be due to the presence of specific factors that are lacking in the current factor-based reprograming approaches. In this review, we focus on studies identifying human oocyte-enriched factors aiming to understand the molecular mechanisms mediating cellular reprograming. We describe the role of oocyte-enriched factors in metabolic switch, chromatin remodelling, and global epigenetic transformation. This is critical for improving the quality of resulting reprogramed cells, which is crucial for therapeutic applications.",

Therefore, a biochemical biomarker reflecting the relative biological age would be helpful to predict an individual\u2019s health status and aging disease risk. Although it is already known for years that cumulative epigenetic changes occur upon aging, DNA methylation patterns were only recently used to construct an epigenetic clock predictor for biological age, which is a measure of how well your body functions compared to your chronological age. Moreover, the epigenetic DNA methylation clock signature is increasingly applied as a biomarker to estimate aging disease susceptibility and mortality risk. Finally, the epigenetic clock signature could be used as a lifestyle management tool to monitor healthy aging, to evaluate preventive interventions against chronic aging disorders and to extend healthy lifespan. Dissecting the mechanism of the epigenetic aging clock will yield valuable insights into the aging process and how it can be manipulated to improve health span.",

Recent discoveries demonstrate that these mobile genetic elements not only act as intragenomic parasites, but also exert regulatory roles in living cells. The risk of genomic instability represented by endogenous retroelements is normally counteracted by a series of epigenetic control mechanisms which include, among the most important, CpG DNA methylation. Indeed, most of the genomic CpG sites subjected to DNA methylation in the nuclear DNA are carried by these repetitive elements. As other parts of the genome, endogenous retroelements and other transposable elements are subjected to deep epigenetic alterations during aging, repeatedly observed in the context of organismal and cellular senescence, in human and other species.

We examined global DNA methylation profiles in tissues from rats of different age, fed with standard or low-calorie diet, and evaluated their association with aging and nutrition. Tissue-specific variations occur during aging with hyper-methylation taking place in all tissues except for liver. The expression of enzymes involved in methylation reactions (DNMTs and TETs) was consistent with the methylation patterns. Nutrition affects global DNA methylation status throughout lifespan. Interestingly, the differences among different tissues are magnified in 96 weeks old rats fed with low calorie diet. Moreover, the low-calorie diet appears to affect the offspring\u2019s epigenetic status more strongly if administered during the maternal pre-gestational period than the gestational and lactation time.Therefore, we propose that changes in the global DNA methylation status may represent an epigenetic mechanism by which age and nutrition intersect each other and, in turn, influence the aging plasticity.",

Epigenetic modification is a natural, age-associated process resulting in highly contextualised gene expression with clear implications for cell differentiation and disease onset. Biological/epigenetic age is independent of chronological age, constituting a highly reflective snapshot of an individual\u2019s overall health. Accelerated vascular ageing is of major concern, effectively lowering disease threshold. Age-related chronic illness involves a complex interplay between many biological processes and is modulated by non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors. These alter the static genome by a number of epigenetic mechanisms, which change gene expression in an age and lifestyle dependent manner. This \u2018epigenetic drift\u2019 impacts health and contributes to the etiology of chronic illness. Lifestyle factors may cause acceleration of this epigenetic \u201cclock\u201d, pre-disposing individuals to cardiovascular disease. Nutrition and physical activity are modifiable lifestyle choices, synergistically contributing to cardiovascular health. They represent a powerful potential epigenetic intervention point for effective cardiovascular protective and management strategies.

Among these mechanisms the knowledge gained on the roles played by epigenetic regulation of gene expression is extensive. Epigenetic control of transcription requires the function of protein complexes whose specific biochemical activities, such as histone mono-ubiquitylation, affect chromatin compaction and, consequently activation or repression of gene expression. Complexes composed of Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins promote transcriptional silencing while those containing trithorax group (trxG) proteins promote transcriptional activation. However, other epigenetic protein factors, such as RYBP, have the ability to interact with both PcG and trxG and thus putatively participate in the reversibility of chromatin compaction, essential to respond to developmental cues and stress signals. This review discusses the developmental and mechanistic functions of RYBP, a ubiquitin binding protein, in epigenetic control mediated by the PcG/trxG proteins to control transcription. Recent experimental evidence indicates that proteins regulating chromatin compaction also participate in other molecular mechanisms controlling development, such as cell death.

Although all vessels manifested aging-related impairment in endothelial vasodilation, CA was the most impacted by aging considering the onset (at 6 months) and magnitude of endothelial dysfunction (reduction by 1.5 log units in the concentration required for 50% of maximal relaxation for acetylcholine). H2O2-induced vasodilations were progressively reduced by aging in aorta, CC and CA while NO-donor-induced vasodilation was impaired by aging only in CA. Serum asymmetric dimethylarginine significantly correlated to endothelial decline in aorta, MA, and CC, while HOMA-IR was significantly associated with endothelial dysfunction in CA and MA. CA are especially vulnerable to aging-related vascular dysfunction. Correlations of vascular dysfunction with systemic biomarkers differ among vessels, further suggesting heterogeneity in aging-induced vascular impact.",

Specifically, maintenance of heterochromatin stability is critical for cellular integrity, and its loss induces genomic instability and cellular aging. However, the causes and effects of heterochromatin instability in multicellular tissue aging still remain unclear. Here, in the adult Drosophila midgut, we report age-related loss of heterochromatin stability in enterocytes (ECs) due to the loss and dispersion of tri-methylated histone H3 Lys9 (H3K9me3) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). Our study further shows that EC-specific knockdown of Su(var)3-9, histone lysine methyltransferase for H3K9me3 formation, or HP1a leads to intestinal stem cell (ISC) aging through genomic stress, JNK signaling, and apoptotic death in ECs. Our findings revealed the plausible causes of age-related loss of heterochromatin stability in ECs, including oxidative stress and nutrient-sensing AKT/TOR signaling. Taken together, the loss of heterochromatin stability may be the crucial niche aging mechanism for ISC aging which is the prime determinant of intestinal tissue aging. Furthermore, our study provides new clues on the link between heterochromatin and aging.",

In human populations, convincing evidence has been accumulated indicating that intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) resulting in low birth weight (<2.5\u202fkg) followed by postnatal catch-up growth is associated with various aspects of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. Fetal macrosomia (birth weight\u202f>\u202f4.5\u202fkg), by contrast, is associated with high risk of non-diabetic obesity and cancers in later life. Developmental modification of epigenetic patterns is considered to be a central mechanism in determining such developmentally programmed phenotypes. Growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis is likely a key driver of these processes. In this review, evidence is discussed that suggests that different aging trajectories can be realized depending on developmentally programmed life-course dynamics of IGF-1. In this hypothetical scenario, IUGR-induced deficit of IGF-1 causes \u201cdiabetic\u201d aging trajectory associated with various metabolic disorders in adulthood, while fetal macrosomia-induced excessive levels of IGF-1 lead to \u201ccancerous\u201d aging trajectory.

     "abstract": "The recognized role of neuroinflammation in the age-related deterioration of neuronal function highlights the importance of understanding the factors that control microglial activation. Microglia, as the immune cells of the brain, are the arbiters of the inflammatory profile in the brain. Normally they are maintained in a quiescent state by means of ligand-receptor interactions with neurons, within a prevailing anti-inflammatory microenvironment. The evidence indicates that, as the ageing process continues, microglia become activated, shift towards an inflammatory phenotype and alter the milieu in the brain. Although there has been progress in identifying factors that contribute to age-related microglial activation, our understanding remains incomplete. Here we report that there was an age-related increase in circulating inflammatory cytokines, accompanied by microglial activation. Neutrophils, and to a greater extent, macrophages, infiltrate the brain with age, perhaps as a result of increased chemokine expression in the brain, specifically CXCL1 and CCL2. We sought to determine whether macrophages might trigger microglial activation and the evidence shows that conditioned medium obtained from interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)-stimulated macrophages potently activated microglia. The data suggest that infiltrating macrophages may be one factor that contributes to age-related microglial activation.",

An increasing collection of data suggests a significant role of circadian system in regulation of cellular response to oxidative stress. However, the molecular mechanism linking circadian clock and antioxidant pathway it is not completely understood. Here we investigated a possible protective role of entrained circadian clock to ozone induced damage in keratinocytes, the main cellular component of human epidermis. Our results showed that, clock-synchronized keratinocytes compared to arrhythmic ones exhibited a more efficient antioxidant response, attested by a faster activation of the master antioxidant regulatory factor NRF2. Moreover, analysis of clock gene expression profiles reveals a more rapid induction of the cardinal clock gene Bmal1 in entrained cells. Based on these findings, we suppose that an adequate coordination of circadian system and antioxidant pathway might be essential to maintain homeostasis in the skin. Alteration of metabolic pathways occurred in neurological diseases or in irregular schedule of life activity could negatively influence tissue gene expression programs and associated organ physiology via its effect on the circadian system.",

     "abstract": "The role of NADPH oxidase in ageing is debated because of the dual roles of free radicals, toxic though necessary. In this paper we summarize some results about two aspects linked to the regulation of the activity of phagocyte NADPH oxidase (Nox2), encountered frequently in elderly people: inflammation and hypercholesterolemia. In the presence of a high amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS) created by itself or by any other source, the enzyme activity is mostly lowered. Oxidation of the membrane and/or of one of the cytosolic partners could be responsible for this loss of activity. However using a cell free system, we had also shown that a low amount of ROS could activate this enzyme. Similarly, cholesterol has a similar dual role, either activating or inhibiting. In in vitro cell free system with neutrophil membranes from healthy donors, the addition, as well as the removal of cholesterol, diminishes the Nox2 activity. The activity of Nox2 is lowered in neutrophils of untreated hypercholesterolemic patients. Finally oxysterols (25-hydroxy-cholesterol or 5\u03b1, 6\u03b1 \u2212 epoxy-cholesterol) do not induce effects different from that of non-oxidized cholesterol. These findings are in agreement with the Janus role of NADPH oxidase, the main source of non-mitochondrial ROS.",

Bioinformatic analysis revealed that OxPL exposure induced the Nrf2 antioxidant stress response and aldosterone signaling. The analysis also revealed that OLR1 is not required for the transcriptional regulation induced by oxidized PAPC but interestingly, OLR1 knockdown affected expression of CNN2, HMRR, ITGB6 and KIF20A, all genes governing cell proliferation and motility.

Chronic wounds are defined as barrier defects that have not proceeded through orderly and timely reparation to regain structural and functional integrity. Several growth factors are involved in wound healing, of which transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) is of particular importance for all phases of this procedure. It exerts pleiotropic effects on wound healing by regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, extracellular matrix production, and modulating the immune response.

As a result, free peroxynitrite and H2O2 interact and generate secondary singlet oxygen. Inactivation of further catalase molecules by secondary singlet oxygen leads to auto-amplification of singlet oxygen generation and catalase inactivation. This allows reactivation of intercellular ROS/RNS-signaling and selective apoptosis induction in tumor cells.The initial singlet oxygen generation seems to be the critical point in this complex biochemical multistep mechanism. Initial singlet oxygen generation requires the interaction between distinct tumor cell-derived ROS and RNS and may also depend on either the induction of NO synthase expression or NOX1 activation through the FAS receptor. FAS receptor activation can be achieved by singlet oxygen.Autoamplificatory generation of singlet oxygen through the interaction between peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide inherits a rich potential for the establishment of synergistic effects that may be instrumental for novel approaches of tumor therapy with high selectivity towards malignant cells.",

Several studies have demonstrated that SR-B1 is also implicated in other physiological processes, such as bacteria and apoptotic cells recognition and regulation of intracellular tocopherol and carotenoids levels. Among the tissues where it is localized, SR-B1 has been shown to be significantly expressed in human epidermis. Our group has demonstrated that SR-B1 levels are down-regulated in human cultured keratinocytes by environmental stressors, such as cigarette smoke, via cellular redox imbalance. Our present study aimed to investigate whether such down-regulation was confirmed in a 3D skin model and under other environmental challengers such as particulate matter and ozone. We also investigated the association between oxidation-induced SR-B1 modulation and impaired wound closure. The data obtained showed that not only cigarette, but also the other environmental stressors reduced SR-B1 expression in epidermal cutaneous tissues and that this effect might be involved in impaired wound healing.",

In a recent work, we have reported increased oxidative and inflammatory responses in Reconstituted Human Epidermis (RHE) exposed to ambient particles (CAPs) and we also demonstrated the ability of CAPs to penetrate the skin tissue.The present study was aimed to better understand the cellular mechanisms beyond the oxidative changes induced by CAPs (5\u201310\u201325\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) in human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT).After 24\u00a0h of treatment, CAPs were able to enter the cells leading to a decrease in viability, increased levels of 4-hydroxinonenal products (4-HNE) and IL-1\u03b1 release. Overall these data, suggest lipid and protein oxidative damage, as well as an increase of inflammatory response after being challenged with CAPs. In addition, 3\u00a0h after CAPs exposure we found a significant increase in NF-kB and Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus. In contrast, no differences in gene expression and enzymatic activity of Nrf2 target genes were detected. This last finding could be explained by the ability of CAPs to possibly alter the binding of Nrf2 to the ARE DNA sequence.",

MCPIP1 upregulation was dependent on the induction of p38, but not p53, as demonstrated by using p38 inhibitor SB203580 and p53 inducer RG7388, respectively. This increase was also blocked by antioxidants (\u03b1-tocopherol and ascorbic acid), suggesting the involvement of MCPIP1 in UVA-induced oxidative stress response. Si-RNA-mediated down-regulation of MCPIP1 expression in HaCaT cells resulted in increased sensitivity to UVA-induced DNA damage and apoptosis. This was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of p53 and p38 in MCPIP1-silenced cells following UVA irradiation. The activation of p38 in response to low doses of ultraviolet radiation was postulated to be protective for p53-inactive cells. Therefore, MCPIP1 may favor the survival of p53-defective HaCaT cells by sustaining the activation of p38. This creates a loop of mutual positive regulation between p38 and MCPIP1 protein in HaCaT cells, providing the protection against the consequences of UVA irradiation.",

Furthermore, new studies have demonstrated that particulate matter (PM) pollutants can penetrate the skin transepidermally and through hair follicles to induce skin aging via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), a recently discovered ligand-activated transcription factor that regulates and protects keratinocytes, melanocytes, and fibroblasts.

In this study, we sought to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the osteogenic differentiation capacities that occur during replicative senescence. It is well known that Oct4 is a key transcription factor essential for maintaining differentiation capacities of the stem cells. In this study, we found that BMSCs at passage 6 (replicative senescent BMSCs) showed marked decreases in the osteogenic differentiation potential and the level of Oct4. These were accompanied by reduced levels of Snf5 and histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in the Oct4 promoter. In BMSCs at passage 2, knockdown of Snf5 diminished expression of Oct4 and disrupted the up-regulation of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) after osteogenic differentiation induction, which was accompanied by a reduction in Snf5 and H3K4me3 binding to the Oct4 promoter. These findings indicate that the decreased level of Snf5 binding to the promoter region of the Oct4 gene down-regulated the expression of Oct4, which may be the mechanism underlying the decline in osteogenic capacities in replicative senescent BMSCs.",

Knockdown of laminin-332 during the culture of IFE-SC-model cells to construct 3-dimensional epidermis in vitro resulted in failure to form proper structure, although no significant change was observed in either cell growth or apoptosis.

Telomere shortening is the key mechanism driving replicative senescence in human fibroblasts. Later, pioneering work by Olivier Toussaint and others showed that stress plays a major role in the induction of senescence in vitro, a phenomenon known as stress-induced premature senescence or SIPS. It is also now widely accepted that senescence plays a role in vivo. An emerging body of evidence from animal models, and particularly mice, has demonstrated an important role for senescence in several processes such as embryonic development, wound healing, tumour suppression and ageing. However, mostly due to a lack of availability of tissues and specific markers, less is known about the importance of cell senescence in humans. In this review, we summarize some of the key findings in the field of senescence, stress-induced senescence and telomeres.

Senescence of proliferation-prone cells is a state of permanent cell cycle arrest accompanied by metabolic activity manifested by high secretion levels of numerous factors, including pro-inflammatory ones. It seems that cell senescence is a stress response. There are many intrinsic and extrinsic stress inducers which can elicit cell senescence. Generally accepted are those causing DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), which trigger permanent activation of DNA damage response (DDR) considered as a hallmark and a cause of cell senescence. In this review we discuss the possibility that cell senescence can be acquired in the absence of DDR or following DDR in the absence of DNA damage. Any scenario seems possible, based on data obtained by many researchers including ourselves, but it should be emphasized that unrepaired DSBs are a well-recognized trigger of senescence.",

In the present study it is shown that during C85 cell progression into methotrexate-induced senescence, dihydrofolate reductase, the primary intracellular target for the drug, is stabilized at the protein level and its enzymatic activity, assayed in crude cellular extracts, decreases by 2-fold. Dihydrofolate reductase inhibition results in an increase in dihydrobiopterin level and an ultimate decrease in the tetrahydrobiopterin: dihydrobiopterin ratio in senescent cells. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression declines. Despite concomitant upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, no nitric oxide generation in senescent cells is detected. Progressing oxidative stress accompanies establishment of the state of senescence. DNA damage, in the form of double strand-breaks, occurs at the highest level at the senescence initiation phase and decreases as cells progress into the senescence maintenance phase.",

The accumulation of senescent cells in tissues is accelerated by stress signals from senescent cells that induce DNA damage and ultimately senescence in bystander cells. We examine here the interplay of senescence-associated mitochondrial dysfunction (SAMD)\u2014driven production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in causing the bystander effect. We show that in various modes of fibroblast senescence ROS are necessary and sufficient to activate the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), which facilitates a large part of the SASP. This ROS-NF-\u03baB axis causes the DNA damage response in bystander cells. Cytokines IL-6 and IL-8 are major components of the pro-inflammatory SASP in senescent fibroblasts. However, their activation in senescence is only partially controlled by NF-\u03baB, and they are thus not strong candidates as intercellular mediators of the bystander effect as mediated by the ROS-NF-\u03baB axis.",

In order to investigate the impact of gossypol on mitochondrial function, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and on oxidative stress in more detail, we used the aging model Podospora anserina that lacks endogenous Bcl-2 proteins. We found that treatment with gossypol selectively increases hydrogen peroxide levels and impairs mitochondrial respiration in P. anserina, apoptosis-deficient Bax/Bak double knockout mouse embryonal fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells. Significantly, we provide evidence that CYPD-mediated opening of the mPTP is required for gossypol-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, autophagy and cell death during organismic aging of P. anserina and in glioblastoma cells.

The expanded ER and the large cell size characteristics of senescent fibroblasts were both reduced upon the invalidation of COX2 as well as ATF6\u03b1. These effects of the ATF6\u03b1 invalidation were prevented by favoring the import of PGE2, but not just by supplying extracellular PGE2.

We have attempted to establish multiple stress response profiles (SRP) of early passage young and late passage senescent human facial skin fibroblasts, FSF-1, exposed to either mild (41\u00a0\u00b0C) and severe (43\u00a0\u00b0C) heat shock for 1\u00a0h, or to mild (2%) and severe (0%) serum deprivation for up to 48\u00a0h. The results obtained show that FSF-1 cells exposed to two different intensities of stress from two different stressors separately have differential SRP to mild and severe stress, which also vary significantly between young and senescent cells. Establishing multiple and differential SRP to mild and severe stress may facilitate distinguishing between the mild stress-induced beneficial hormetic effects and the harmful effects of severe stress.",

However, increasing evidence supports a role for PrPC in the cellular response to oxidative stress. In the present study, a new link between PrP and senescence is highlighted. The role of PrP in premature senescence induced by copper was investigated. WI-38 human fibroblasts were incubated with copper sulfate (CuSO4) to trigger premature senescence. This induced an increase of PrP mRNA level, an increase of protein abundance of the normal form of PrP and a nuclear localization of the protein. Knockdown of PrP expression using specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) gave rise to appearance of several biomarkers of senescence as a senescent morphology, an increase of senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity and a decrease of the cellular proliferative potential. Overall these data suggest that PrP protects cells against premature senescence induced by copper.",

The rats were fed with high-fat diet to establish a hyperlipidemic model, which showed an increase in plasma lipids and endothelial senescence, accompanied by the elevation in plasma levels of miR-21-5p/203a-3p, down-regulation of Drp1 and up-regulation of p53 in the aorta of hyperlipidemic rats; these phenomena were reversed by atorvastatin.

The primary focus of the first part was to monitor changes in cortical activity when unexpectedly altering the sensory conditions of upright stance, such as switching from stable (eyes open, fixed support surface) to less-stable (eyes closed, sway-referenced support surface) conditions. Our results demonstrate increased cortical activations in delta (0.2\u20134\u202fHz) and gamma (30\u201350\u202fHz) oscillations, primarily over central-frontal, central, and central parietal cortices during challenging postural conditions. While increased delta rhythms were observed in both groups during challenging sensory conditions, elderly individuals also showed increased gamma band activity over sensorimotor and parietal cortices, when compared to the younger group. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show age differences in balance related cortical activations during continuous postural tasks with challenging sensory conditions. Preliminary correlations also suggest that increased cerebral activity became more relevant to the control of Center of Mass (COM) dynamics when upright stance is threatened. The results of Experiment-2 also showed for the first time that oscillatory rhythms of the cortex are coherent with muscle firing characteristics suggesting increased corticospinal drive from leg motor cortex to lower limb motoneurons following postural perturbations. Finally, perturbation evoked potential (PEP) analyses suggest that, rather than motor system malfunctioning, impairments in perceptual processing of sensory afference forms the basis of prolonged muscle response delays during perturbed balance in the elderly.",

This is a perspective of studying oxidative stress as a constitutive signal within the cell.

The ability of miRNAs to regulate multiple targets within a pathway or even multiple pathways allows for coordinated regulation of brain functions. miRNA-mediated, brain functional changes are evident in cognition, inflammation, neuroprotection, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and lifespan. Dysregulation of brain miRNAs contributes to accelerated cognitive decline and increased neurological disorders. Elucidating mechanisms by which miRNAs and their multiple targets are temporally and spatially regulated in normal and pathological brain aging will provide a deeper understanding on the process of interrelated pathways of brain aging, and a new insight into therapeutic interventions.",

     "abstract": "Ageing is a complex biological process characterized by the progressive loss of biological fitness due to the accumulation of macromolecular and cellular damage that affects most living organisms. Moreover, ageing is an important risk factor for many pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and cancer. However, the ageing rate can be modulated by genetic, nutritional, and pharmacological factors, highlighting the concept of \u201cageing plasticity\u201d. Progeroid syndromes are a group of rare genetic diseases that resemble many characteristics of physiological ageing. Accordingly, studies on these diseases have been very useful for gaining mechanistic insights in ageing biology. In recent years, a great effort has been made in ageing research and several works have confirmed that geromiRs, the growing subgroup of miRNAs implicated in ageing, are able to modulate organismal lifespan. However, very little is still known about the impact of miRNA in premature ageing. In this review, we will address the functional relevance of this class of small non-coding RNAs in the regulation of the hallmarks of progeroid syndromes. In addition, we will discuss the potential strategies for managing progeria based on geromiR modulation.",

In this commentary, we first demonstrate the causes and mechanisms of somatic stem cell aging in a new aspect of miRNAs. The functions of stem cells decline with age in diverse tissues due to cellular damages and congenital disorders. The somatic stem cells exhibit type-specific phenotypes with cellular senescence during the aging process. We explore the specific miRNAs regulating stem cell aging and age-related diseases. The functional investigations of the miRNAs in somatic stem cells and degenerative diseases might facilitate the translation of knowledge into clinical practice for the regulation of stem cell aging and aging-related diseases.",

Accumulating studies in a wide range of species from yeast to human revealed changes associated with the aging process to be conserved throughout evolution. The main characteristics of aging are (i) genomic instability, (ii) loss of telomere function, (iii) epigenetic changes,(iv) increased cellular senescence, (v) depletion of the stem cell pool, (vi) altered intercellular communication and (vii) loss of protein homeostasis. Among the multiple molecular mechanisms underlying aging, alterations of the translation machinery affecting the rate and selectivity of protein biosynthesis seem to play a central role. At the very heart of translation is the ribosome, a multifaceted and universally conserved RNA-protein particle responsible for accurate polypeptide synthesis and co-translational protein folding. Here we summarize and discuss recent developments on the contribution of altered translation and age-dependent modifications on the ribosome structure to aging and cellular senescence.",

If true, this suggests that aging may be widespread among microbial species in general, and that studying aging in microbes may inform other long-standing questions in aging.

Evaluating the lipidomics profile of the whole thymus, between the ages of 4 (young) and 18 months (old), we found increased amounts of triacylglycerides, free cholesterol, cholesterol ester and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) with age. Moreover, levels of C24:0 and C24:1 sphingomyelins and ceramide C16:0 were elevated in 12\u201314 month-old (middle-aged) mice while the levels of sulfatide ceramide and ganglioside GD1a increased in the old thymus. Evaluating isolated thymocytes, we found increased levels of cholesterol ester and 4-HNE adducts, as compared to young mice. Next, we treated middle-aged mice with growth hormone (GH), which has been considered a potent immunomodulator. GH reduced thymic levels of TNF-\u03b1 and 4-HNE and increased the number of thymocytes as well as the thymic levels of dihydroceramide, a ceramide precursor and autophagic stimuli for cell survival.

More importantly, to the best of our knowledge, no longitudinal study has thus far examined the link between polymorphisms in DSB repair and the risk of death. This longitudinal study thus analyses whether four common polymorphisms (rs2155209, rs7963551, rs17105278, rs2735383) in four selected DSB repair genes (MRE11A, RAD52, RAD51B, NBS1) influence the hazard of age-adjusted death in a cohort of patients with typical symptoms of ischemic heart disease.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of CD34+ cell telomere length and hTERT expression on the clinical outcome of autologous CD34+ cell transplantation. We studied 43 patients with cardiomyopathy. Their peripheral blood CD34+ cells were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, enriched by immunoselection and delivered transendocardially. Relative telomere length and expression levels of hTERT were measured using a real-time PCR assay. Immunoselected CD34+ cells had longer telomere length compared to leukocytes in leukapheresis products (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In multivariate analysis, CD34+ cell telomere length was not associated with the clinical outcome (b\u00a0=\u00a03.306, p\u00a0=\u00a00.540). While hTERT expression was undetectable in all leukapheresis products, 94.4% of the CD34+ enriched cell products expressed hTERT. Higher CD34+hTERT expression was associated with a better clinical outcome on univariate analysis (b\u00a0=\u00a087.911, p\u00a0=\u00a00.047). Our findings demonstrate that CD34+ cell telomere length may not influence the clinical outcome in cardiomyopathy patients treated with autologous CD34+ cell transplantation. Larger studies are needed to validate the impact of the CD34+hTERT expression on the clinical outcome of autologous CD34+ cell transplantation.",

We aimed to assess the age-dependency of ventricular arrhythmias in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and the corresponding ventricular structural and molecular remodeling.Ventricular arrhythmias were quantified using 24-h radiotelemetry ECG monitoring in eight SHRs and four Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats at 14 (young), 24 (adult), and 48 (aging) weeks of age. Left ventricular histology and mRNA expressions of 89 proarrhythmogenic genes were assessed in six additional groups (n\u00a0=\u00a04 each) of young, adult, and aging SHRs and WKYs.Regardless of their age, SHRs presented more premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) than age-matched WKYs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The arrhythmogenicity peak occurred in adult SHRs; ventricular tachycardias only occurred in adult SHRs. Among the SHRs, LV thickness, interstitial fibrosis, and the number of deregulated genes increased with age. Kcnj11 expression was deregulated in adult, but not in young or aging SHRs.This study confirms the presence of higher ventricular ectopy in SHRs than in age-matched WKYs. LVH appeared to be an adaptive, antiarrhythmic process. Myocardial energetic changes with advancing age, as reflected by Kcnj11 expression changes, could underlie this age-dependency of ventricular arrhythmias.",

When mechanistically attributed to repair of critically short telomeres, the lifespan extending action of telomerase cannot be reconciled with the observation that telomerase-null mice do not exhibit shortening of lifespan for at least two generations. We hypothesized that telomerase may interfere with replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in a way that reduces formation of deletions \u2212 the primary cause of age-dependent cell attrition in non-renewable cells such as myocytes and neurons. Here we show that several tRNA genes may function as alternative origins of replication (ORIs). We also show that telomerase interacts with canonical light strand ORI (ORIL) and tRNAs and modifies their activities. Our results suggest that replication of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) proceeds through a variety of mechanisms resulting in a mixture of classic strand-displacement mode, and coupled replication of heavy and light strands. Our results also suggest that effects of telomerase may arise from binding ORIL and thus limiting contribution of the deletion-prone strand displacement mode to mtDNA synthesis. These findings imply that it may be possible to uncouple detrimental and beneficial effects of telomerase, and thereby to improve telomerase-based strategies to extend lifespan.",

Medically, approximately 97% of centenarians contract chronic diseases including hypertension and gastrointestinal disease; however, they present with few cardiovascular risk factors. The low prevalence of diabetes mellitus and carotid atherosclerotic plaques is peculiarities of centenarians, which could be associated with high adiponectin levels. While conducting the Tokyo centenarian study (TCS), we found that only 20% of centenarians enjoyed physical and cognitive independence at the age of 100 years, although most remained independent in daily living until into their 90s. Those who maintained physical independence at 100 years of age were highly likely to become semi-supercentenarians (over 105 years) or even supercentenarians (beyond 110 years). We also describe parts of results of the Japan Semi-supercentenarian Study (JSS), which showed that the suppression of chronic inflammation is an important driver of successful aging at extreme old age. Telomere maintenance and an extremely low frequency of APOE-\u03b54 alleles are genetic peculiarities of (semi)-supercentenarians. The available data confirm our conviction that semi-supercentenarians are a more appropriate model for the study of human longevity.",

Longevity is a complex multifactorial phenomenon on which specific biological pathways, including hormonal networks involved in the regulation of homeostasis and survival, exert a strong impact. THs are the key responsible for growth, metabolism rate and energy expenditure, and help in maintaining cognition, bone and cardiovascular health. THs production and metabolism are fine tuned, and may help the organism to cope with a variety of environmental challenges. Experimental evidence suggests that hypothyroid state may favor longevity by reducing metabolism rate, oxidative stress and cell senescence. Data from human studies involving healthy subjects and centenarians seem to confirm this view, but THs changes observed in older patients affected by chronic diseases cannot be always interpreted as a protective adaptive mechanism aimed at reducing catabolism and prolonging survival. Medications, selected chronic diseases and multi-morbidity can interfere with thyroid function, and their impact is still to be elucidated.",

     "abstract": "Human life expectancy and the number of the oldest old are rapidly increasing worldwide. Advanced age is the main risk factor for dementia, representing one of the major causes of disability/dependency among older people with a strong impact on their families/caregivers. Centenarians have reached the extreme limits of human life escaping or delaying the major age-related diseases. Thus, these extraordinary individuals embody the best model to answer the crucial question if cognitive decline and dementia are progressive and unavoidable occurrences of increasing age. Despite a growing amount of data underlines the importance of cognitive function for quality of life and survival in old age, studies on centenarians have paid more attention to their physical condition rather than the assessment of their actual cognitive abilities. Accordingly, this work aims to summarize available data on the prevalence of dementia in centenarians and to critically address topics which can have a relevant impact on the cognitive assessment/status of the oldest old: (i) lack of standardized tools for cognitive assessment; (ii) criteria and threshold to establish the presence of dementia; (iii) influence of birth cohort and education; (iv) role of depression or positive attitude towards life; (v) gender differences.",

We describe the connections between genes that promote longevity and genes associated with age-related diseases considering tradeoff mechanisms in which the same genetic variants could have different effects according to the tissue considered and could be involved in several biological pathways. Then we describe mechanisms of antagonistic pleiotropy, focusing on the complex interplay between genetic variants and environmental changes (internal or external). We sustain the use of centenarians as \u201csuper-controls\u201d for the study of the major age-related diseases, starting from the concept that the maximization of the phenotypic differences in the considered cohort, achieved by selecting the most divergent phenotypes, could be useful for increasing the significant differences observed in the genetic association study.

However, in the context of antigen receptor gene assembly, known as V(D)J recombination, DSBs are obligatory intermediates that allow the establishment of genetic diversity and adaptive immunity. V(D)J recombination is initiated when the lymphoid-restricted recombination-activating genes RAG1 and RAG2 are expressed and form a site-specific endonuclease (the RAG nuclease or RAG recombinase). Here, we discuss the ability of the RAG nuclease to minimize the risks of genome disruption by coupling the breakage and repair steps of the V(D)J reaction. This implies that the RAG genes, derived from an ancient transposon, have undergone strong selective pressure to prohibit transposition in favor of promoting controlled DNA end joining in cis by the ubiquitous DNA damage response and DNA repair machineries. We also discuss the idea that, in addition to being essential for the rearrangement of antigen receptor genes, RAG-mediated DSBs could impact cellular processes and outcomes by affecting genetic and epigenetic programs.",

Past research has been largely focused on cell-autonomous stress responses; however, recently their systemic outcomes within an organism and their implications at the ecological and species levels have emerged. Maintenance of species depends on the high fidelity transmission of the genome over infinite generations; thus, many pathways exist to monitor and restore the integrity of the genome and to coordinate DNA repair with other cellular processes, such as cell division and growth. The specifics of these DNA damage responses (DDRs) vary vastly but some general themes are conserved from ancient organisms, such as bacteria and archaea, to humans. Despite decades of research, however, DDRs still have many layers of complexity and some surprises left to be discovered. One of the most interesting current research topics is the link between DNA damage and stress resistance: the outcomes of DDRs can protect the organism from other secondary challenges. At this time, these types of responses are best characterized in bacteria and the simple metazoan model, Caenorhabditis elegans, but it is becoming clear that similar processes also exist in higher organisms.",

Among the 7 selected miRNAs, miR-21-5p and miR-203a-3p were significantly up-regulated in a human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) senescent model induced by ox-LDL, consistent with their changes in the hyperlipidemic rats. After performing the bioinformatic analysis, dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) was predicted to be a potential target for both miR-21-5p and miR-203a-3p. In ox-LDL-induced senescent HUVECs, Drp1 was significantly down-regulated, concomitant with mitochondrial dysfunctions and the activation of AMPK-p53/p16 pathway, while these phenomena were attenuated by miR-21-5p or miR-203a-3p inhibitor. Luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed a direct interaction between miR-21-5p and Drp1 but not between miR-203a-3p and Drp1. Based on these observations, we conclude that miR-21-5p/203a-3p promote ox-LDL-induced endothelial senescence through down-regulation of Drp1 in a direct or indirect way.

In addition, the mRNA expression level of the catalase gene CTT1 (which encodes cytosolic catalase) and total catalase activity were strongly down-regulated in the KSP1-deleted strain compared with those in wild-type cells. Moreover, the KSP1 deficiency also leads to a shortened replicative lifespan, which could be restored by the increased expression of CTT1.

Each time a cell divides, 25\u2013200 base pairs are lost from the terminal sequence of chromosomes. By becoming truncated during cell division, telomeres protect essential genes from being shortened and thus inactivated. In addition, telomeres are sensitive to inflammation and oxidative stress, which can further promote telomere shortening. Reduction in the length of telomeres leads to the cessation of cell division and thus cellular senescence and apoptosis. This review discusses evidence for the role of oxidative stress and inflammation in regulating the length of telomeres in mammalian cells during senescence.

We further examined whether such within-individual changes differed among birds living under control (ad lib food) or more challenging environmental conditions (unpredictable food availability), having previously found that the latter increased corticosterone levels when food was absent but improved survival over a three year period. Our key findings were: (i) 8-OHdG and PC increased with age in both environments, with a higher increase in 8-OHdG in the challenging environment; (ii) SOD increased with age in the controls but not in the challenged birds, while the opposite was true for OXY; (iii) control birds with high levels of 8-OHdG died at a younger age, but this was not the case in challenged birds.

Moreover, aging is associated with a state of chronic inflammation, influencing life expectancy. Our purpose was to investigate a 10-year predictive ability of CD34\u00a0+\u00a0CPCs, inflammatory marker levels, classic CV risk factors (CVRFs), and Framingham Risk Score (FRS) in a population of healthy, self-sufficient octogenarians.

Moreover, by dividing our patients into tertiles based on age reached, this difference was more remarkable the higher the age reached. Regressive analyses suggested that the chances of reaching an older age depend on higher CD34\u00a0+\u00a0CPCs at baseline and are not significantly affected by inflammatory markers levels, FRS, CVFRs, or HDL-C levels.

Aging is a process by which these systems gradually lose their ability to maintain their out-of-equilibrium state, as measured by their free-energy rate density, and hence, their order. Thus, the process of aging reduces the efficiency of those systems, making them fragile and less adaptive to the environmental fluctuations, gradually driving them towards the state of thermodynamic equilibrium. In this paper, we discuss the various metrics that can be used to understand the process of aging from a complexity science perspective. Among all the metrics that we propose, action efficiency, is observed to be of key interest as it can be used to quantify order and self-organization in any physical system. Based upon our arguments, we present the dependency of other metrics on the action efficiency of a system, and also argue as to how each of the metrics, influences all the other system variables. In order to support our claims, we draw parallels between technological progress and biological growth. Such parallels are used to support the universal applicability of the metrics and the methodology presented in this paper. Therefore, the results and the arguments presented in this paper throw light on the finer nuances of the science of aging.",

Complex processes involving gene expression and epigenetic regulation are considered to perpetuate across generations. In addition to transfer of germline factors, epigenetic inheritance via gametes also requires a mechanism whereby the information pertaining to the induced traits is communicated from soma to germline. Despite violating a century-old view in biology, this communication seems to play a role in transmission of environmental effects across generations. Circulating RNAs, especially those associated with extracellular vesicles like exosomes, are emerging as promising candidates that can transmit gene regulatory information in this direction. Cumulatively, these new observations provide a basis to integrate epigenetic inheritance.

Reconfiguring existing research paradigms, we review the concept of \u2018degeneracy\u2019, which has divergent popular and technical definitions. The technical meaning of degeneracy refers to the structural diversity underlying functional plasticity. Degeneracy is a distributed system property that can be observed within individual brains or across different brains. For example, dementias with similar behavioural anomalies can result from a diverse range of cellular \u201cfaults\u201d, which is an example of degeneracy because the symptoms are similar in spite of different underlying mechanisms. Degeneracy is a valuable epistemological tool that can transformatively enhance scientific models of bodily ageing. We propose that movement science is one of the first areas that can productively integrate degeneracy into models of bodily ageing. We also propose model organisms such as eusocial honey bees in which degeneracy can be studied at the molecular and cellular level. Developing a vocabulary for thinking about how distributed variable factors are interlinked is important if we are to understand bodily ageing not as a single entity, but as the heterogeneous construction of changing biological, social, and environmental processes.",

Cardiolipin is the main anionic phospholipid present in mitochondrial membranes, and plays a key role in mitochondrial function, signaling and stress response. Expression levels of the enzymes involved in cardiolipin biosynthesis and remodeling were quantified and found to be upregulated in CR animals. Interestingly, when mitochondrial membranes were fractionated, the outer membrane presented a higher content of cardiolipin, indicating a redistribution of this phospholipid mediated by a phospholipid scramblase in CR. This change is associated with Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fragmentation and autophagy. Overall, we find that CR promotes extensive mitochondrial membrane remodeling, decreasing oxidatively damaged lipids, and increasing cardiolipin levels and redistributing cardiolipin. These changes in membrane properties are consistent with and may be causative of changes in mitochondrial morphology, function and turnover previously found to occur in CR.",

The results showed that, in the absence of glycation, a small number of these CD45+ cells could differentiate either into dendritic-like cells (DC-SIGN+, BDC1a+, DC-LAMP+) or macrophage- like cells (CD14+, CD68+, CD163+) whereas, with glycation, the number of monocytes, dendritic cells, macrophage-like cells were found surprisingly increased. In-vivo our results showed also that dendritic and macrophage-like cells were increased and suggest a possible link with the age-dependent glycation level in the skin. In addition, we found that, unlike fibroblasts incorporated in the reconstructed skin, these cells expressed specific receptors for AGEs (RAGE and SRA). Taken altogether, our data show that cells of the monocyte lineage, in the presence of AGEs, can differentiate into dendritic or macrophage-like cells and could lead to a micro inflammatory environment.",

The mechanisms that regulate the aging epigenome and level of conservation are not entirely clear. We performed affinity-based enrichment with methyl-CpG binding domain protein followed by high-throughput sequencing (MBD-seq) to assay DNA methylation in mouse samples. Consistent with previous reports, aging is associated with increase in methylation at CpG islands that likely overlap regulatory regions of genes that have been implicated in cancers (e.g., C1ql3, Srd5a2 and Ptk7). The differentially methylated regions in mice have high sequence conservation in humans and the pattern of methylation is also largely conserved between the two species. Based on human ENCODE data, these sites are targeted by polycomb proteins, including EZH2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that these regions interact with EZH2 in mice as well, and there may be reduction in EZH2 occupancy with age at C1ql3. This adds to the growing evidence that EZH2 is part of the protein machinery that shapes the aging epigenome. The conservation in both sequence and methylation patterns of the age-dependent CpGs indicate that the epigenetic clock is a fundamental feature of aging in mammals.",

This work demonstrates the development of a significant AD-like neuropathology due to these metabolic alterations.C57BL/6J mice strain were divided into two groups, one fed with a diet rich in palmitic acid (high-fat diet, HFD) since their weaning until 16 months of age, and another group used as a control with a regular diet. The analyses were carried out in the dentate gyrus area of the hippocampus using a Thioflavin-S stain and immunofluorescence assays.The most significant finding of the present research was that HFD induced the deposition of the \u03b2A peptide. Moreover, the diet also caused alterations in different cell processes, such as increased inflammatory reactions that lead to a decrease in the neuronal precursor cells. In addition, the results show that there were also dysregulations in normal autophagy and apoptosis, mechanisms related to \u03b2A formation.The present findings confirm that HFD favors the formation of \u03b2A depositions in the brain, a key feature of AD, supporting the metabolic hypothesis of sporadic AD.",

We hypothesize that limited surrogate light chain (SLC) and compromise of the pre-B cell receptor checkpoint in old mice contribute to both reduced new B cell generation and changes in the anti-PC antibodies seen in old age. In old mice: 1) early pre-B cell loss is most pronounced at the preBCR checkpoint; however, the reduced pool of early pre-B cells continues to proliferate consistent with preBCR signaling; 2) increased PC reactivity is seen in bone marrow immature B cells; 3) deficient SLC promotes increased B cell PC reactivity and diminished T15 idiotype expression; and 4) as pre-B cell losses and reduced SLC become progressively more severe, increased T15 negative PC reactive B cells occur. These results associate a reduction in pre-B cells, imposed at the preBCR checkpoint, with increased reactivity to PC, but more limited expression of the protective T15 idiotype among PC reactive antibodies in old age.",

After 28 consecutive days of immobilization stress, behavioral tests were conducted and tissue sampling was performed. The results showed that the body weight of middle-aged mice was severely lowered by stress, but emotional behaviors were hardly influenced by either aging or stress. Aging influenced changes in amino acid metabolism in the brain and increased various amino acid levels in the uterus and ovary.

These changes influence the expression of catabolic factors resulting in increased production of matrix metalloproteinases and cytokines, reduced levels of collagen type II and aggrecan synthesis, and increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

During ageing, a general deregulation of metabolism occurs, affecting molecular, cellular and physiological activities in the organism. Dysfunction of mitochondria has been associated with ageing and age-related diseases indicating their importance in the maintenance of cell homeostasis. Three major nutritional sensors, mTOR, AMPK and Sirtuins are involved in the control of mitochondrial physiology. These nutritional sensors control mitochondrial biogenesis, dynamics by regulating fusion and fission processes, and turnover through mito- and autophagy. Apart of the known factors involved in fusion, OPA1 and mitofusins, and fission, DRP1 and FIS1, emerging factors such as prohibitins and sestrins can play important functions in mitochondrial dynamics regulation. Mitochondria is also affected by sexual hormones that suffer drastic changes during ageing. The recent literature demonstrates the complex interaction between nutritional sensors and mitochondrial homeostasis in the physiology of adipose tissue and in the accumulation of fat in other organs such as muscle and liver. In this article, the role of mitochondrial homeostasis in ageing and age-dependent fat accumulation is revised.

Both pro-survival and pro-death programs involve regulated communication between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. In yeast, recent data suggest this inter-organelle contact is facilitated by the endoplasmic reticulum mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES). These membrane contacts are not only important for the exchange of cellular signals, but also play a role in mitochondrial tethering during mitophagy, mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial inheritance.

We showed instead that, in the absence of any apoptotic stimulus, the Tps1 protein itself was necessary in preventing massive, spontaneous commitment of yeast cells to apoptosis during growth. Without Tps1p, the life span was shortened and cells were sensitized to acetic acid (AA) and H202, whereas the overexpression of the inactive variant of Tps1p almost abolished AA-triggered apoptosis. Genetic interaction analysis of TPS1 and genes such as YCA1, NUC1 and AIF1 indicated that these key executioners of cell death partially relayed tps1\u0394-triggered signaling.

In conclusion, our studies demonstrated that tolerance/survival-promoting properties of OSIP108 can be significantly improved by single amino acid substitutions, and that these properties are dependent on (an) intracellular target(s), yet to be determined.",

     "abstract": "A universal feature of the replication of positive-strand RNA viruses is the association with intracellular membranes. Carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) replication in plants occurs in vesicles derived from the mitochondrial outer membrane. The product encoded by CIRV ORF1, p36, is required for targeting the virus replication complex to the outer mitochondrial membrane both in plant and yeast cells. Here the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model host to study the effect of CIRV p36 on cell survival and death. It was shown that p36 does not promote cell death, but decreases cell growth rate. In addition, p36 changed the nature of acetic acid-induced cell death in yeast by increasing the number of cells dying by necrosis with concomitant decrease of the number of cells dying by programmed cell death, as judged by measurements of phosphatidylserine externalization. The tight association of p36 to membranes was not affected by acetic acid treatment, thus confirming the peculiar and independent interaction of CIRV p36 with mitochondria in yeast. This work proved yeast as an invaluable model organism to study both the mitochondrial determinants of the type of cell death in response to stress and the molecular pathogenesis of (+)RNA viruses.",

Caloric restriction (CR) is the only non-genetic intervention shown to promote lifespan extension in several model organisms. CR has been shown to alleviate syn toxicity and herein we confirmed the same effect on the yeast model for synucleinopathies during chronological lifespan. The data gathered showed that TOR1 deletion also results in similar longevity extension and abrogation of syn toxicity. Intriguingly, these interventions were associated with decreased autophagy, which was maintained at homeostatic levels. Autophagy maintenance at homeostatic levels promoted by CR or TOR1 abrogation in syn-expressing cells was achieved by decreasing Sir2 levels and activity.

Here, we investigated the effects of NAM supplementation in the context of yeast chronological aging, the established model for studying aging of postmitotic quiescent mammalian cells. Our data show that NAM supplementation at the diauxic shift results in a phenocopy of chronologically aging sir2\u0394 cells. In fact, NAM-supplemented cells display the same chronological lifespan extension both in expired medium and extreme Calorie Restriction. Furthermore, NAM allows the cells to push their metabolism toward the same outcomes of sir2\u0394 cells by elevating the level of the acetylated Pck1. Both these cells have the same metabolic changes that concern not only anabolic pathways such as an increased gluconeogenesis but also respiratory activity in terms both of respiratory rate and state of respiration. In particular, they have a higher respiratory reserve capacity and a lower non-phosphorylating respiration that in concert with a low burden of superoxide anions can affect positively chronological aging.",

Aneuploidy is commonly linked to pathological states. It is a hallmark of spontaneous abortions and birth defects and it is observed virtually in every human tumor, therefore being generally regarded as detrimental for the development or the maturation of tissues under physiological conditions. Polyploidy however, occurs as part of normal physiological processes during maturation and differentiation of some mammalian cell types. Surprisingly, high levels of aneuploidy are present in the brain, and their frequency increases with age suggesting that the brain is able to maintain its functionality in the presence of high levels of mosaic aneuploidy. Because somatic aneuploidy with age can reach exceptionally high levels, it is likely to have long-term adverse effects in this organ. We describe the mechanisms accountable for an abnormal DNA content with a particular emphasis on the CNS where cell division is limited. Next, we briefly summarize the types of GIN known to date and discuss how they interconnect with CIN. Lastly we highlight how several forms of CIN may contribute to genetic variation, tissue degeneration and disease in the CNS.",

Myelin is only formed by fully differentiated oligodendrocytes, but the entire oligodendrocyte lineage are clear targets of the altered chemistry of the aging brain. As in neurons, unrepaired DNA damage accumulates in the postmitotic oligodendrocyte genome during normal aging, and indeed may be one of the upstream causes of cellular aging \u2013 a fact well illustrated by myelin co-morbidity in premature aging syndromes arising from deficits in DNA repair enzymes. The clinical and experimental evidence from Alzheimer\u2019s disease, progeroid syndromes, ataxia-telangiectasia and other conditions strongly suggest that oligodendrocytes may in fact be uniquely vulnerable to oxidative DNA damage. If this damage remains unrepaired, as is increasingly true in the aging brain, myelin gene transcription and oligodendrocyte differentiation is impaired. Delineating the relationships between early myelin loss and DNA damage in brain aging will offer an additional dimension outside the neurocentric view of neurodegenerative disease.",

We investigated the age-related events that contribute to 3-NPA toxicity. 3-NPA induced neuronal death, oxidative stress and altered mitochondrial structure in neuronal cells. 3-NPA injection in vivo caused motor impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage with different trend in young and adult mice. To understand the age-dependent mechanisms, we carried out proteomic analysis of the striatal protein extract from young mice (control: YC vs. 3-NPA treated: YT) and adult mice (control: AC vs. 3-NPA treated: AT). Among the 3752 identified proteins, 33 differentially expressed proteins (mitochondrial, synaptic and microsomal proteins) were unique either to YT or AT. Interestingly, comparison of the proteomic profile in AC and YC indicated that 161 proteins (linked with cytoskeletal structure, neuronal development, axogenesis, protein transport, cell adhesion and synaptic function) were down-regulated in AC compared to YC.

In recent years, novel mechanisms linking DNA damage to neuronal dysfunction have been identified and have led to the development of noninvasive treatment strategies. Further investigations into the molecular mechanisms connecting DNA damage to AD pathology may help to develop novel treatment strategies for this debilitating disease.

It has been shown that insulin resistance impairs glucose metabolism and mitochondrial function, thus increasing production of reactive oxygen species. Recent progress in Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) research revealed that insulin production and signaling are severely impaired in AD brain, thereby resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress. Among possible oxidative DNA lesions, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) is highly accumulated in the brain of AD patients. Previously we have shown that incorporating 8-oxoG in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA promotes MUTYH (adenine DNA glycosylase) dependent neurodegeneration. Moreover, cortical neurons prepared from MTH1 (8-oxo-dGTPase)/OGG1 (8-oxoG DNA glycosylase)-double deficient adult mouse brains is shown to exhibit significantly poor neuritogenesis in vitro with increased 8-oxoG accumulation in mitochondrial DNA in the absence of antioxidants. Therefore, 8-oxoG can be considered involved in the neurodegenerative process in AD brain. In mild cognitive impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative damage may induce synaptic dysfunction due to energy failures in neurons thus resulting in impaired cognitive function. If such abnormality lasts long, it can lead to vicious cycles of oxidative damage, which may then trigger the neurodegenerative process seen in Alzheimer type dementia.",

AD neurodegeneration is initially apparent in the hippocampus; as AD progresses, many more brain regions are affected. PD-associated neurodegeneration is relatively limited to dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), especially in cases in which patients inherit particular disease-causing mutations. Thus, the task of elucidating mechanisms by which loss of function of one particular protein triggers death of a subset of neurons may be more approachable. Understanding the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in these forms of PD may not only shed light on avenues leading toward therapeutic strategies in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases, but also on those leading toward understanding natural ageing. Neurodegeneration in PD patients harboring homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the PARK2 gene may result from unbalanced levels of ROS, which are mostly produced in mitochondria and can irreparably damage macromolecules and trigger apoptosis. This review discusses mitochondrial sources of ROS, how ROS can trigger apoptosis, mechanisms by which Parkin loss-of-function may cause neurodegeneration by increasing ROS levels, and concludes with hypotheses regarding selective SNpc dopaminergic neuron vulnerability.",

In many cases, these syndromes almost exclusively impact the nervous system, underscoring the critical requirement for genome stability in this tissue. A striking example of this is defective enzymatic activity of polynucleotide kinase-phosphatase (PNKP), leading to microcephaly or neurodegeneration. Notably, the broad neural impact of mutations in PNKP can result in markedly different disease entities, even when the inherited mutation is the same. For example microcephaly with seizures (MCSZ) results from various hypomorphic PNKP mutations, as does ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 4 (AOA4). Thus, other contributing factors influence the neural phenotype when PNKP is disabled. Here we consider the role for PNKP in maintaining brain function and how perturbation in its activity can account for the varied pathology of neurodegeneration or microcephaly present in MCSZ and AOA4 respectively.",

     "abstract": "It is unknown whether DNA damage accumulation is an upstream instigator or secondary effect of the cell death process in different populations of adult postmitotic neurons in the central nervous system. In two different mouse models of injury-induced neurodegeneration characterized by relatively synchronous accumulation of mitochondria, oxidative stress, and DNA damage prior to neuronal apoptosis, we enforced the expression of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) and human apurinic-apyrimidinic endonuclease-1/Ref1 (hAPE) using recombinant adenoviruses (Ad). Thalamic lateral geniculate neurons and lumbar spinal cord motor neurons were transduced by Ad-hOGG1 and Ad-hAPE injections into the occipital cortex and skeletal muscle, respectively, prior to their target deprivation- and axotomy-induced retrograde apoptosis. Enforced expression of hOGG1 and hAPE in thalamus and spinal cord was confirmed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. In injured populations of neurons in thalamus and spinal cord, a DNA damage response (DDR) was registered, as shown by localization of phospho-activated p53, Rad17, and replication protein A-32 immunoreactivities, and this DDR was attenuated more effectively by enforced hAPE expression than by hOGG1 expression. Enforced expression of hOGG1 and hAPE significantly protected thalamic neurons and motor neurons from retrograde apoptosis induced by target deprivation and axotomy. We conclude that a DDR response is engaged pre-apoptotically in different types of injured mature CNS neurons and that DNA repair enzymes can regulate the survival of retrogradely dying neurons, suggesting that DNA damage and activation of DDR are upstream mechanisms for this form of adult neurodegeneration in vivo, thus identifying DNA repair as a therapeutic target for neuroprotection.",

Strong metabolic activity associated with high transcriptional levels in these long lived post-mitotic cells render them vulnerable to oxidative genome damage, including DNA strand breaks and mutagenic base lesions. There is growing evidence for the accumulation of unrepaired DNA lesions in the central nervous system (CNS) during accelerated aging and progressive neurodegeneration. Several germ line mutations in DNA repair or DNA damage response (DDR) signaling genes are uniquely manifested in the phenotype of neuronal dysfunction and are etiologically linked to many neurodegenerative disorders. Studies in our lab and elsewhere revealed that pro-oxidant metals, ROS and misfolded amyloidogenic proteins not only contribute to genome damage in CNS, but also impede their repair/DDR signaling leading to persistent damage accumulation, a common feature in sporadic neurodegeneration. Here, we have reviewed recent advances in our understanding of the etiological implications of DNA damage vs. repair imbalance, abnormal DDR signaling in triggering neurodegeneration and potential of DDR as a target for the amelioration of neurodegenerative diseases.",

ATM is a key regulatory kinase that interacts with and phosphorylates multiple substrates that influence critical, cell-cycle control and DNA damage repair pathways in addition to other pathways.

We considered lifespan and feeding behaviors as well as motor and cellular functions on the 1:2 and 1:16 P:C diets. We observe that parkin mutants have a longer lifespan when fed the 1:16 P:C compared to those fed the 1:2 P:C diet. Parkin mutants fed the 1:16 P:C diet have delayed climbing deficit, increased resistance to starvation. Mutant flies fed the 1:16 P:C diet also have improved mitochondrial functions as evidenced by increased respiratory control ratio and mitochondrial membrane potential and decreased reactive oxygen species production and superoxide activity especially in old parkin mutants.

EPC impairment contributes to doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin accelerates EPC aging, although mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain to be fully clarified. Here we investigated if Nox2 activity is able to modulate the premature senescence induced in vitro by doxorubicin in human EPCs. Results showed that in conditioned media obtained from late EPC cultures, the levels of interleukin-6, isoprostanes and nitric oxide bioavailability were increased and reduced respectively after 3\u00a0h of doxorubicin treatment. These derangements returned to physiological levels when cells were co-treated with apocynin or gp91ds-tat (antioxidant and specific Nox2 inhibitors, respectively). Accordingly, Nox2 activity resulted to be activated by doxorubicin. Importantly, we found that Nox2 inhibition reduced doxorubicin-induced EPC senescence, as indicated by a lower percentage of \u03b2-gal positive EPCs. In conclusion, Nox2 activity efficiently contributes to the mechanism of oxidative stress-induced increase in premature aging conferred by doxorubicin.

The discovery of EPCs has lead to new insights in vascular repair and atherosclerosis and also a new theory for ageing. EPCs from the bone marrow and some other organs aid in vascular repair by migrating to distant vessels where they differentiate into mature endothelial cells and replace old and injured endothelial cells. The ability of EPCs to repair vascular damage depends on their number and functionality. Currently marketed drugs used in a variety of diseases can modulate these characteristics. In this review, the effect of currently available treatment options for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders on EPC biology will be discussed. The various EPC-based therapies that will be discussed include lipid-lowering agents, antihypertensive agents, antidiabetic drugs, phosphodiesteraze inhibitors, hormones, as well as EPC capturing stents.",

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) are the main players involved in the endogenous repair mechanisms that can counteract endothelial dysfunction.A mounting body of data indicates that exercise enhances endothelial renewal through mobilization of bone marrow-derived EPCs and CACs, making it an effective therapeutic tool for CHF.Interestingly, emerging evidence has been showing that exercise training can also promote epigenetic modifications, e.g. DNA methylation, histone modifications, and differential expression of specific non-coding RNAs like microRNA (miRNAs).Since deregulation of the miRNAs involved in endothelial function modulation has widely been documented in circulating cells and plasma of CHF patients, deregulation of epigenetic features could play a key role in disease progression.Here, we review current knowledge of the contribution of EPCs and CACs to endothelial repair mechanisms in CHF patients, focusing on the effects induced by exercise training and hypothesizing that some of these effects can be mediated by epigenetic mechanisms.",

An impaired function of the immune system may increase susceptibility to various diseases in the elderly population such as infections, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Although it is unclear how this immune phenotype develops, emerging evidence suggest that it may reflect an exhaustion of the immune system, possibly caused by one or several chronic infections. The main candidate is human cytomegalovirus (CMV), which can induce immune dysfunctions observed in immunoscenescence. Although the immune system is currently considered to be exhausted in CMV positive elderly individuals, it is not known whether such dysfunction of the immune system is a main reason for increased susceptibility to other diseases, or if direct effects of the virus in disease pathogenesis reflect the increased vulnerability to them.

Here we report suppressive effects of sirtinol, a sirtuin antagonist, on hCMV infection and its cellular and molecular consequences. Human diploid fibroblast WI-38 cells were infected by hCMV Towne strain in the absence or presence of sirtinol. hCMV replication was measured using qPCR. Senescent phenotype was determined by senescence-associated \u03b2 galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) activity. Expression of hCMV immediate early (IE) and early (E) proteins and senescence-associated proteins (pRb and Rb, p16INK4, and p53) and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed using standard laboratory assays. The results demonstrated that sirtinol suppressed hCMV infection as well as hCMV-induced activation of molecular mechanisms of senescence and ROS production. While underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated, these findings indicate sirtinol as a novel and potent anti-hCMV agent with the potential to be developed as an effective treatment for chronic hCMV infection and its cellular and molecular consequences that are important to ageing and health of older adults.",

Even though entropy cannot be easily associated with any specific molecular damage, the increase of entropy in structural mass may be connected with heat stress, which is known to generate double strand breaks. Double strand breaks, which are in turn known to play an important role in process of aging, are thus connected to both aging and an increase of entropy. In view of these associations, we propose a new model where the increase of entropy leads to the formation of double strand breaks, resulting in an aging phenotype.

The purpose of this study was to determine if aging alters skeletal muscle regeneration and leucine-induced alterations in markers of protein synthesis.

Protein and gene expression of markers of protein synthesis and degradation, respectively, were analyzed at three days post-injection. Following injury in young mice, leucine supplementation was observed to elevate only p-p70S6K.

The tissue was stained using a modification of toluidine blue (nucleic acid \u2013 specific) staining method. A total of 480 chromatin structures (20 for each animal) were analyzed. For each structure, the values of fractal dimension, lacunarity, textural angular second moment and inverse difference moment were calculated using ImageJ software and its plugins. The results indicated the age-related reduction in fractal dimension and increase in lacunarity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Fractal dimension is a potentially good indicator of age associated changes in chromatin structure. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that fractal complexity of hepatocyte chromatin decreases during the process of physiological aging. Fractal analysis as a method could be useful in detection of small age-related changes in chromatin distribution not otherwise visible with naked eye on conventional tissue micrographs.",

Methionine restriction lead to decreased blood glucose levels compared to control-fed mice, and enhanced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt and S6 in kidneys, indicative of improved glucose homeostasis. Increased expression of lipogenic genes and downregulation of PEPCK were observed, suggesting that kidneys from MR-fed animals are more insulin sensitive.

     "abstract": "Drugs screenings in search of enhancers or suppressors of selected readout(s) are nowadays mainly carried out in single cells systems. These approaches are however limited when searching for compounds with effects at the organismal level. To overcome this drawback the use of different model organisms to carry out modifier screenings has exponentially grown in the past decade. Unique characteristics such as easy manageability, low cost, fast reproductive cycle, short lifespan, simple anatomy and genetic amenability, make the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans especially suitable for this purpose. Here we briefly review the different high-throughput and high-content screenings which exploited the nematode to identify new compounds extending healthy lifespan. In this context, we describe our recently developed screening strategy to search for pro-longevity interventions taking advantage of the very reproducible phenotypes observed in C. elegans upon different degrees of mitochondrial stress. Indeed, in Mitochondrial mutants, the processes induced to cope with mild mitochondrial alterations during development, and ultimately extending animal lifespan, lead to reduced size and induction of specific stress responses. Instead, upon strong mitochondrial dysfunction, worms arrest their development. Exploiting these automatically quantifiable phenotypic readouts, we developed a new screening approach using the Cellomics ArrayScanVTI-HCS Reader and identified a new pro-longevity drug.",

     "abstract": "The progression of many neurodegenerative diseases is assumed to be caused by misfolding of specific characteristic diseases related proteins, resulting in aggregation and fibril formation of these proteins. Protein misfolding associated age related diseases, although different in disease manifestations, share striking similarities. In all cases, one disease protein aggregates and loses its function or additionally shows a toxic gain of function. However, the clear link between these individual amyloid-like protein aggregates and cellular toxicity is often still uncertain. The similar features of protein misfolding and aggregation in this group of proteins, all involved in age related neurodegenerative diseases, results in high interest in characterization of their structural properties. We review here recent findings on structural properties of some age related disease proteins, in the context of their biological importance in disease.",

Their deregulation is often observed in various pathologies, such as age and non-age related diseases including cancer. Although epithelial cells and fibroblasts are capable to exert both functions, under a plethora of insults, the fact that they exhibit notable intrinsic differences in cell/tissue homeostasis properties, might be a crucial determinant of the mode of response to a certain stress signal. Sparse evidence in the literature reveals that in the same tissue/organ context and under the same conditions, the cell type seems to drive the differential counteraction between epithelia and fibroblasts. Based on the above notion we propose that, upon stress insults, human fibroblasts seem to predominantly respond via senescence, while epithelial cells prefer to exert apoptosis. We suggest that considering the tissue as a whole (epithelium and stroma) would benefit research into new therapeutic strategies for chronic diseases and cancer.",

In this paper, we review some recent publications investigating dynamics of biomarkers in relation to mortality, which use single biomarkers as well as cumulative measures combining information from multiple biomarkers.

These studies were designed to assess age-dependent alterations in renal structure and function at late-life timepoints, 16\u201324 months. Elevations in BUN and plasma creatinine were not significant until 24 months, however, elevations in the more sensitive markers of function, plasma cystatin C and proteinuria, were detectable at 16 and 18 months, respectively. Interestingly, cystatin C levels were not corrected by caloric restriction. Urinary Kim-1, a marker of CKD, was elevated as early as 16 months. Klotho gene expression was significantly decreased at 24 months, but not at earlier timepoints. Alterations in renal structure, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, were noted at 16 months, with little change from 18 to 24 months. Tubulointerstitial inflammation was increased at 16 months, and remained similar from 18 to 24 months. A SEM (structural equation modeling) model of age-related renal dysfunction suggests that proteinuria is a marker of renal damage, while urinary Kim-1 is a marker of both damage and function. Taken together, these results demonstrate that age-dependent nephropathy begins as early as 16 months and progresses rapidly over the next 8 months.",

These events have different effects on the several aspects of reproductive function.

Its developmental expression is strictly regulated and it is rapidly induced in conditions of stress. Hsp22 is one of the few sHSP to be localized inside mitochondria, and is the first sHSP to be involved in the mitochondrial unfolding protein response (UPRMT) together with Hsp60, mitochondrial Hsp70 and TRAP1. The UPRMT is a pro-longevity mechanism, and interestingly Hsp22 over-expression by-itself increases lifespan and resistance to stress. To unveil the effect of Hsp22 on the mitochondrial proteome, comparative IEF/SDS polyacrylamide 2D gels were done on mitochondria from Hsp22+ flies and controls. Among the proteins influenced by Hsp22 expression were proteins from the electron transport chain (ETC), the TCA cycle and mitochondrial Hsp70. Hsp22 co-migrates with ETC components and its over-expression is associated with an increase in mitochondrial protease activity. Interestingly, the only protease that showed significant changes upon Hsp22 over-expression in the comparative IEF/SDS-PAGE analysis was cathepsin D, which is localized in mitochondria in addition to lysosome in D. melanogaster as evidenced by cellular fractionation. Together the results are consistent with a role of Hsp22 in the UPRMT and in mitochondrial proteostasis.",

Laminins are major components of the basement membranes and cooperate with growth factors and matrix-dependent receptors in cell proliferation and differentiation. Previously, we reported the association of rs659822-C/T in LAMA5, encoding the laminin-\u03b15 chain, with weight and height in a cohort of healthy 64\u2013107 aged Italian individuals. Notably, two independent meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies found the C-allele of LAMA5 rs4925386-C/T correlated with the risk of colorectal cancer.We tested additional SNPs within the LAMA5 gene for association with anthropometric traits and longevity in our cohort of elderly subjects (N\u00a0=\u00a0624). Under an additive model, the rs2427283-C allele (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and the rs4925386-T allele (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) were associated with shorter stature. Age-stratified analyses showed that the rs4925386-T allele was also positively associated with longevity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The association of LAMA5 rs4925386 alleles with both inter-individual differences in height and in longevity suggests that laminins may be among the factors linking stature and cancer susceptibility.",

The objective of this study was to examine the development of DC in adult C57Bl6J mice fed a 40% ER diet. We observed increased myeloid progenitors, but decreased common DC progenitors, precursor conventional DC and plasmacytoid DC. Furthermore, we observed increased macrophages and cells expressing CD169 in the bone marrow of ER mice.

Examining rates of proliferation with 6\u00a0h BrdU incorporation and Ki-67 staining showed these DC progenitor populations have different proliferation rates in ER compared with AL mice. We show here, for the first time, ER results in altered myelopoiesis resulting in reduced DC development but enhanced monocyte/macrophage development in steady-state C57Bl6J mice. In conclusion, these data may partially explain prior observations of impaired early innate immune responses to primary infection such as influenza in ER mice.",

We selected four high-confidence aDMPs (located in the vicinity of the ELOVL2, GLRA1, MYOD1 and PDE4C genes) and quantified DNA methylation across these regions in four tissues (blood, lung, cerebellum and hippocampus) from male and female C57BL/6J mice, ranging in age from fetal (embryonic day 17) to 630 days. We observed tissue-specific age-associated changes in DNA methylation that was directionally consistent with those observed in humans. These findings lend further support to the notion that changes in DNA methylation are associated with chronological age and suggest that these processes are often conserved across tissues and between mammalian species.

To contribute to a better understanding of the correlation of calorie reduction and DNA repair in humans, we adapted the host cell reactivation assay to an application with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, we used this reliable and reproducible assay to research the influence of a special kind of calorie reduction, namely F. X. Mayr therapy, on DNA repair capacity. We found a positive effect in all persons with low pre-existing DNA repair capacity. In individuals with normal pre-existing DNA repair capacity, no effect on DNA repair capacity was detectable. Decline of DNA repair, accumulation of oxidative DNA damages, mitochondrial dysfunction, telomere shortening as well as caloric intake are widely thought to contribute to aging.

However, FUdR alters lifespan in some genotypes and induces resistance to thermal and proteotoxic stress. We report that hypertonic stress in combination with FUdR treatment or inhibition of the FUdR target thymidylate synthase, TYMS-1, extends C. elegans lifespan by up to 30%. By contrast, in the absence of FUdR, hypertonic stress decreases lifespan. Adaptation to hypertonic stress requires diminished Notch signaling and loss of Notch co-ligands leads to lifespan extension only in combination with FUdR. Either FUdR treatment or TYMS-1 loss induced resistance to acute hypertonic stress, anoxia, and thermal stress. FUdR treatment increased expression of DAF-16 FOXO and the osmolyte biosynthesis enzyme GPDH-1. FUdR-induced hypertonic stress resistance was partially dependent on sirtuins and base excision repair (BER) pathways, while FUdR-induced lifespan extension under hypertonic stress conditions requires DAF-16, BER, and sirtuin function. Combined, these results demonstrate that FUdR, through inhibition of TYMS-1, activates stress response pathways in somatic tissues to confer hormetic resistance to acute and chronic stress. C. elegans lifespan studies using FUdR may need re-interpretation in light of this work.",

Knockdown of gst-14 dramatically extends the lifespan of gas-1 and increases hydroxynonenal (HNE) modified mitochondrial proteins without improving complex I function. We observed no change in reactive oxygen species levels as measured by Mitosox staining, consistent with a potential role of GST-14 in HNE clearance. The upregulation of gst-14 in gas-1 animals is specific to the pharynx. These data suggest that an HNE-mediated response in the pharynx could be beneficial for lifespan extension in the context of complex I dysfunction in C. elegans.

Some biochemical and genetic defects that initiate and promote AD include: (a) increased oxidative stress, (b) chronic inflammation (c) mitochondrial dysfunction, (d) A\u00df1-42 peptides generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), (e) proteasome inhibition, and (f) mutations in APP, presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 genes.

Therefore, reducing these defects simultaneously may reduce the development and progression of AD. Previous studies with individual antioxidants produced consistent benefits in animal models of AD; however, a similar approach produced inconsistent results in human AD. This review proposes a hypothesis that simultaneous elevation of the levels of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant compounds is necessary for optimally reducing oxidative stress and chronic inflammation in human AD. Supplementation can enhance the levels of antioxidant compounds; but elevation of antioxidant enzymes requires activation of Nrf2. This review discusses activation and regulation of Nrf2. The need for multi- antioxidants that can affect multi-targets has been proposed without specific recommendations.

At the peak of EAE, the frequency of reactivated cells was lower, whereas that of the regulatory CD4+ cells was higher in male rat spinal cord.

All these processes are regulated by cis-acting motifs and trans-acting factors that determine the rates of translation and degradation of transcripts. Specific messenger RNA granules that harbor the mRNA decay machinery or various factors, involved in translational repression and transient storage of mRNAs, are also part of the mRNA fate regulation. Their assembly and function can be modulated to promote stress resistance to adverse conditions and over time affect the ageing process and the lifespan of the organism. Here, we provide insights into the complex relationships of ageing modulators and mRNA turnover mechanisms.",

This work analyze whether high concentration of extracellular phosphate induces vascular smooth muscle cells senescence, exploring the intracellular mechanisms and highlighting the in vivo relevance of this phenomenon.Human aortic smooth muscle cells treated with \u03b2-Glycerophosphate (BGP, 10\u00a0mM) suffered cellular senescence by increasing p53, p21 and p16 expression and the senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity. In parallel, BGP induced ILK overexpression, dependent on the IGF-1 receptor activation, and oxidative stress. Down-regulating ILK expression prevented BGP-induced senescence and oxidative stress. Aortic rings from young rats treated with 10\u00a0mM BGP for 48\u00a0h, showed increased p53, p16 and ILK expression and SA-\u03b2-gal activity. Seven/eight nephrectomized rats feeding a hyperphosphatemic diet and fifteenth- month old mice showed hyperphosphatemia and aortic ILK, p53 and p16 expression.In conclusion, we demonstrated that high extracellular concentration of phosphate induced senescence in cultured smooth muscle through the activation of IGF-1 receptor and ILK overexpression and provided solid evidences for the in vivo relevance of these results since aged animals showed high levels of serum phosphate linked to increased expression of ILK and senescence genes.",

From spot intensity analysis, CD4+ T cell surface \u03b1-enolase was decreased in expression by 1.5 fold in the older age group; this was verified by flow cytometry (n\u00a0=\u00a022) and qPCR with significantly lower expression of cellular \u03b1-enolase mRNA and protein compared to young adult CD4+ T cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Mice were daily submitted to rotational stress, for 28 days, until euthanasia. After 28 days, mice were killed and normal skin was analyzed. Macroscopically, dorsum skin of chronically stressed mice presented more wrinkled when compared to that of nonstressed mice. In mice skin, chronic stress increased lipid peroxidation, carbonyl protein content, nitrotyrosine levels, neutrophil infiltration, neutrophil elastase, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 and metalloproteinase-8 levels. Nevertheless, chronic stress reduced dermis thickness, collagen type I, fibrilin-1 and elastin protein levels in mice skin. In in vitro assays, murine skin fibroblasts were exposed to elevated epinephrine levels plus inhibitors of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS), fibroblast activity was evaluated in a short time. In skin fibroblast culture, treatment with inhibitors of ROS and RNS synthesis abolished the increase in carbonyl protein content and lipid peroxide accumulation induced by epinephrine.

The effect of nanomolar concentrations of TTX on SAN pacemaking was lessened in adulthood compared with that in youth. Interestingly, the pacemaking became more sensitive to TTX and TTX-induced sinus arrhythmias occurred more frequently in the senescent group. The presences of NaCh \u03b1 subunit isoforms Nav1.1, Nav1.6 as well as \u03b2 subunit isoforms Nav\u03b21 and Nav\u03b23 in SAN were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Western blot revealed a declination of Nav1.1, Nav1.6, Nav\u03b21 and Nav\u03b23 proteins during aging. Furthermore, laser captured SAN cells were used for further real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis, which also confirmed the presences of Nav1.1, Nav1.6, Nav\u03b21 and Nav\u03b23 mRNA and their reduced levels in rat SAN during aging.These results indicated an age-dependent alterations in expression and relative function of NaCh in rat SAN.",

     "abstract": "In multicellular organisms the proper system functionality is ensured by the balance between cell division, differentiation, senescence and death. This balance is changed during aging. Immunosenescence plays a crucial role in aging and leads to the shrinkage of T cell repertoire and the propensity to apoptosis. The elimination of expanded T cells at the end of immune response is crucial to maintain homeostasis and avoid any uncontrolled inflammation. Resting mature T lymphocytes, when activated via their antigen-specific receptor (TCR) and CD28 co-receptor, start to proliferate and then undergo the so called activation induced cell death (AICD), which mechanistically is triggered by the death receptor and leads to apoptosis. T lymphocytes, like other cells, are also exposed to damage, which can trigger the so called damage-induced cell death (DICD). It was hypothesized that oxidative stress and chronic antigenic load increasing with age reduced lymphocyte susceptibility to DICD and enhanced a proinflamatory status leading to increased AICD. However, data collected so far are inconsistent and does not support this assumption. Systematic and comprehensive studies are still needed for conclusive elucidation of the role of AICD and DICD in human immunosenescence, including the role of autophagy and necroptosis in the processes.",

Glycation, a feature of ageing, can lead to non-degradable and less functional proteins and enzymes and can additionally induce inflammation and further pathophysiological processes such as neurodegeneration.In this study we investigated the influence of glycation on the high affinity NGF-receptor TrkA and the AGE-receptor RAGE. We quantified the binding affinity of the TrkA-receptor and RAGE to their ligands by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and compared these to the binding affinity after glycation. At the same time, we established a glycation procedure using SPR. We found that glycation of TrkA reduced the affinity to NGF by a factor of three, which could be shown to lead to a reduction of NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Glycation of RAGE reduced binding affinity of AGEs by 10-fold.",

     "abstract": "Regular physical exercise has anti-inflammatory effects in elderly subjects. Yet, the inflammatory responses after whole body vibration (WBV) training, a popular exercise paradigm for the elderly, remain to be elucidated. This study assessed the effects of WBV training on the inflammatory response associated with toll-like receptors (TLRs) signaling pathways. Twenty-eight subjects were randomized to a training group (TG) or a control group (CG). TG followed an 8-week WBV training program. Blood samples were obtained before and after the training period in both groups. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated, and mRNA and protein levels of makers involved in the TLR2/TLR4 myeloid differentiation primary response gen 88 (MyD88) and TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing interferon (TRIF)-dependent pathways were analyzed. Plasma TNF\u03b1 and C-reactive protein levels were also assessed. The WBV program reduced protein expression of TLR2, TLR4, MyD88, p65, TRIF and heat shock protein (HSP) 60, while HSP70 content increased. IL-10 mRNA level and protein concentration were upregulated, and TNF\u03b1 protein content decreased, after WBV training. Plasma concentration of C-reactive protein and TNF\u03b1 decreased in the TG. The current data suggest WBV may improve the anti-inflammatory status of elderly subjects through an attenuation of MyD88- and TRIF-dependent TLRs signaling pathways.",

Despite many studies recently probed into the comorbid state of both diseases, so far the precise mechanism for this association is poorly understood. Emerging evidences suggest that defects in galanin play a central role on type 2 diabetes mellitus and is considered to be a risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease development. This review provides a new insight into the multivariate relationship among galanin, type 2 diabetes mellitus and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, highlighting the effect of galanin system on the cross-talk between both diseases in human and rodent models. The current data support that activating central GalR2 attenuates insulin resistance and Alzheimer\u2019s disease feature in animal models.

In order to test the hypothesis that syndecans might affect life span by affecting metabolic endophenotypes, 11 SNPs within the SDC4 gene were tested for association with longevity in a cohort of 64\u2013107 aged individuals. We then determined whether the longevity-associated SNPs were correlated with metabolic parameters in the age group 64\u201385 years. RobustSNP association tests showed that rs1981429 was negatively associated with longevity (Theop\u00a0=\u00a00.028), but also with high levels of triglyceride (Theop\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and low levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (Theop\u00a0=\u00a00.009).

Phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors have recently been shown a potential therapeutic effect on AD. In this study, the effects of yonkenafil (yonk), a novel PDE-5 inhibitor, on cognitive behaviors as well as the pathological features in transgenic AD mice were investigated. Seven-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice were treated with yonk (2, 6, or 18\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)) or sildenafil (sild) (6\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.) daily for 3 months and then behavioral tests were performed. The results demonstrated that yonk improved nesting-building ability, ameliorated working memory deficits in the Y-maze tasks, and significantly improved learning and memory function in the Morris water maze (MWM) tasks. In addition, yonk reduced the area of A\u03b2 plaques, and inhibited over-activation of microglia and astrocytes. Furthermore, yonk increased neurogenesis in the dentate granule brain region of APP/PS1 mice, indicated by increased BrdU+/NeuN+ and BrdU+/DCX+ cells compared to vehicle-treated transgenic mice. These results suggest that yonk could rescue cognitive deficits by ameliorated amyloid burden through regulating APP processing, inhibited the over-activation of microglia and astrocytes as well as restored neurogenesis.",

Aging carries with it a series of physiological changes; one of them is an imbalance in the hemostatic system. Thus the levels or activity of various proteins involved, such as most coagulation factors, natural anticoagulants and the fibrinolytic system are altered so that the hemostatic balance leans toward thrombosis. Also, platelet activity suggests a state of abnormal activation (P-selectin, beta thromboglobulin and platelet factor). In this review we will systematically examine the alterations in the hemostatic components that occur during aging.

The StAR protein predominantly regulates steroid biosynthesis in steroidogenic tissues. We have reported that regulation of retinoid, especially atRA and 9-cis RA, responsive StAR transcription is largely mediated by an LXR\u2013RXR/RAR heterodimeric motif in the mouse StAR promoter. Herein we demonstrate that retinoids are capable of enhancing StAR protein, P-StAR, and steroid production in granulosa, adrenocortical, glial, and epidermal cells. Whereas transient expression of RAR\u03b1 and RXR\u03b1 enhanced 9-cis RA induced StAR gene transcription, silencing of RXR\u03b1 with siRNA, decreased StAR and steroid levels. An oligonucleotide probe encompassing an LXR\u2013RXR/RAR motif bound to adrenocortical and epidermal keratinocyte nuclear proteins in EMSAs. ChIP studies revealed association of RAR\u03b1 and RXR\u03b1 with the StAR proximal promoter. Further studies demonstrated that StAR mRNA levels decreased in diseased and elderly men and women skin tissues and that atRA could restore steroidogenesis in epidermal keratinocytes of aged individuals. These findings provide novel insights into the relevance of retinoid signaling in the up-regulation of steroid biosynthesis in various target tissues, and indicate that retinoid therapy may have important implications in age-related complications and diseases.",

Genotyping was conducted for CYP1B1 (rs1056836), COMT (rs4680), GSTP1 (rs1695), MnSOD (rs4880), KRAS (rs61764370), and MTHFR (rs1801133 and rs1801131) polymorphisms.

Our recent work showed that Drosophila ISCs are an excellent model for stem cell studies evaluating age-related increase in centrosome amplification. Here, we showed that metformin, a recognized anti-cancer drug, inhibits age- and oxidative stress-induced centrosome amplification in ISCs. Furthermore, we revealed that this effect is mediated via down-regulation of AKT/target of rapamycin (TOR) activity, suggesting that metformin prevents centrosome amplification by inhibiting the TOR signaling pathway. Additionally, AKT/TOR signaling hyperactivation and metformin treatment indicated a strong correlation between DNA damage accumulation and centrosome amplification in ISCs, suggesting that DNA damage might mediate centrosome amplification. Our study reveals the beneficial and protective effects of metformin on centrosome amplification via AKT/TOR signaling modulation.

Macrodissected hippocampus, striatum, parietal cortex, cerebellum were assayed for tissue concentrations of glutathione (GSH), gamma-glutamyl-cysteine-synthetase (\u03b3-GCS), total thiols, protein carbonyls, mRNAs of clusterin and the known protective enzymes thioredoxine-1 (TRX-1), glutaredoxine-1 (GLRX-1), superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1).

Clusterin, TRX-1, GLRX-1, SOD-1 mRNA levels were maintained or increased in the hippocampus with age. Age-dependency of the markers differed between sexes, with SOD-1 and TRX-1 decreases out of hippocampus in females. Since antioxidants were reported to decrease with age in the brain of Wistar rats, maintenance of GSH levels and of protective enzymes mRNA levels in the LOU rat brain could contribute to the preservation of cognitive functions in old age.

The higher levels of p21 in OA MPCs are also correlated with a decreased chondrogenic differentiation capacity and synovial inflammation, however, there was no evidence of senescence in the OA cells.The results of this study suggest that cell cycle regulation in MPCs may be altered in OA and that modulation of this pathway may have therapeutic potential once the mechanism by which this regulates stem/progenitor cells is better understood.",

     "abstract": "Ageing affects most, if not all, functional systems in the body. For example, the somatic motor nervous system, responsible for initiating and regulating motor output to skeletal musculature, is vulnerable to ageing. The nigrostriatal dopamine pathway is one component of this system, with deficits in dopamine signalling contributing to major motor dysfunction, as exemplified in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). However, while the dopamine deficit in PD is due to degeneration of substantia nigra (SN) dopamine (DA) neurons, it is unclear whether there is sufficient loss of SN DA neurons with ageing to explain observed motor impairments. Instead, evidence suggests that age-related loss of DA neuron function may be more important than frank cell loss. To further elucidate the mechanisms of functional decline, we have investigated age-related changes in gene expression specifically in laser microdissected SN DA neurons. There were significant age-related changes in the expression of genes associated with neurotrophic factor signalling and the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity. Furthermore, reduced expression of the DA neuron-associated transcription factor, Nurr1, may contribute to these changes. Together, these results suggest that altered neurotrophic signalling and tyrosine hydroxylase activity may contribute to altered DA neuron signalling and motor nervous system regulation in ageing.",

The model takes into considerations the energy tradeoffs between life history traits and the efficiency of the energy utilization, and offers quantitative and qualitative explanations for a set of seemingly contradictory empirical results. We show that oxidative metabolism can affect cellular damage and longevity in different ways in animals with different life histories and under different experimental conditions. Qualitative data and the linearity between energy expenditure, cellular damage, and lifespan assumed in previous studies are not sufficient to understand the complexity of the relationships. Our model provides a theoretical framework for quantitative analyses and predictions. The model is supported by a variety of empirical studies, including studies on the cellular damage profile during ontogeny; the intra- and inter-specific correlations between body mass, metabolic rate, and lifespan; and the effects on lifespan of (1) diet restriction and genetic modification of growth hormone, (2) the cold and exercise stresses, and (3) manipulations of antioxidant.",

The results indicate signal propagation from G protein-coupled receptors through signaling pathway components and other stress and nutrient-induced transcription factors resulting in adaptation of yeast cells to the lack of nutrients by activating metabolism associated with aerobic metabolism of carbon sources such as ethanol, glycerol and fatty acids. In addition, we found STE12, XBP1 and TOS8 as highly connected nodes in the subnetworks of ageing yeast.",

Phosphodiesterases (PDE) are the enzymes involved in the metabolism of cyclic nucleotides and the inhibition of phosphodiesterases is considered to be viable strategy to restore the level of cyclic nucleotides and their functions in the brain. Various synthetic PDE inhibitors had been used clinically for various disorders and also suggested to be useful candidates for treating neurological disorders. However, side effects of these synthetic PDE inhibitors have limited their use in clinical practice. Natural plant extracts or their bio-active compounds are considered to be safe and are widely acceptable. During the last decade, many plant extracts or their bio-active compounds were tested pre-clinically for PDE inhibitory activity and are reported to be equally potent in inhibiting PDE\u2019s, as that of synthetic compounds. The present review is aimed to discuss the potential plant extract/compounds with PDE inhibitory activity and critically discuss their potential role in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

We previously identified a protein named WDR-23 as a direct repressor of SKN-1 in C. elegans. Loss of wdr-23 influences stress resistance, longevity, development, and reproduction, but it is unknown if WDR-23 influences development and reproduction solely through SKN-1 and the mechanisms by which SKN-1 promotes stress resistance and longevity are poorly defined. Here, we characterize phenotypes of wdr-23 and skn-1 manipulation and explore the role of glutathione. We provide evidence that diverse wdr-23 phenotypes are dependent on SKN-1, that beneficial and detrimental phenotypes of wdr-23 and skn-1 can be partially decoupled, and that SKN-1 activation delays degenerative tissue changes during aging. We also show that total glutathione levels are substantially elevated when the wdr-23/skn-1 pathway is activated and that skn-1 is required for preserving this cellular antioxidant during stress and aging. Alternatively, total glutathione was not elevated in worms with reduced insulin/IGF-1-like signaling or dietary restriction suggesting that SKN-1 ensures longevity via different mechanisms under these conditions. Lastly, genetic interaction data revise our understanding of which skn-1 variants are required for longevity during dietary restriction.",

     "abstract": "Aging is an inevitable and multifactorial biological process. Free radicals have been implicated in aging processes; it is hypothesized that they cause cumulative oxidative damage to crucial macromolecules and are responsible for failure of multiple physiological mechanisms. However, recent investigations have also suggested that free radicals can act as modulators of several signaling pathways such as those related to sirtuins. Caloric restriction is a non-genetic manipulation that extends lifespan of several species and improves healthspan; the belief that many of these benefits are due to the induction of sirtuins has led to the search for sirtuin activators, especially sirtuin 1, the most studied. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red grapes, was first known for its antioxidant and antifungal properties, and subsequently has been reported several biological effects, including the activation of sirtuins. Endogenously-produced melatonin, a powerful free radical scavenger, declines with age and its loss contributes to degenerative conditions of aging. Recently, it was reported that melatonin also activates sirtuins, in addition to other functions, such as regulator of circadian rhythms or anti-inflammatory properties. The fact that melatonin and resveratrol are present in various foods, exhibiting possible synergistic effects, suggests the use of dietary ingredients to promote health and longevity.",

     "abstract": "Though defective genome maintenance and DNA repair have long been known to promote phenotypes of premature aging, the role protein methylation plays in these processes is only now emerging. We have recently identified the first N-terminal methyltransferase, NRMT1, which regulates protein-DNA interactions and is necessary for both accurate mitotic division and nucleotide excision repair. To demonstrate if complete loss of NRMT1 subsequently resulted in developmental or aging phenotypes, we constructed the first NRMT1 knockout (Nrmt1\u2212/\u2212) mouse. The majority of these mice die shortly after birth. However, the ones that survive, exhibit decreased body size, female-specific infertility, kyphosis, decreased mitochondrial function, and early-onset liver degeneration; phenotypes characteristic of other mouse models deficient in DNA repair. The livers from Nrmt1\u2212/\u2212 mice produce less reactive oxygen species (ROS) than wild type controls, and Nrmt1\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts show a decreased capacity for handling oxidative damage. This indicates that decreased mitochondrial function may benefit Nrmt1\u2212/\u2212 mice and protect them from excess internal ROS and subsequent DNA damage. These studies position the NRMT1 knockout mouse as a useful new system for studying the effects of genomic instability and defective DNA damage repair on organismal and tissue-specific aging.",

During progressive ageing atrial conduction slows associating with increasing susceptibility to arrhythmias. Changes in Cx43 protein expression, or its phosphorylation status, can instigate changes in the conduction of the cardiac action potential. This study investigated whether increased levels of activated c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) is responsible for the decline of Cx43 during ageing. Right atria from guinea pigs aged between 1 day and 38 months of age were examined. The area of the intercalated disc increased with age concurrent with a 75% decline in C43 protein expression. An age-dependent increase in activated-JNK correlated with a rise in phosphorylated Cx43, but also slowing of action potential conduction velocity across the atria from 0.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0m/s at 1 month of age to 0.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0m/s at 38 months. The JNK activator anisomycin increased activated JNK in myocytes and reduced Cx43 protein expression simulating ageing. The JNK inhibitor SP600125, was found to eradicate almost all trace of Cx43 protein. We conclude that in vivo activation of JNK increases with age leading to the loss of Cx43 protein resulting in impaired conduction and contributing to the increasing risk of atrial arrhythmias with advancing age.",

Throughout zooidal life, multipotent epithelial and coelomic cell nuclei showed strong trimethylation signals at H3 lysine27 (H3K27me3), consistent with the results of western blotting. Epidermal H3K27me3 repeatedly appeared in protruding buds and disappeared in senescent adult zooids. The budding-specific cytostatic factor TC14-3 allowed aging epidermal cells to restore H3K27me3 signals and mitochondrial gene activities via mitochondrial transcription factor a, all of which were made ineffective by an H3K27me3 inhibitor. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that TC14-3 enhances H3K27me3 of transdifferentiation-related genes and consequently downregulates the expression of these genes. In contrast, trimethylation signals at H3 lysine4 (H3K4me3) appeared transiently in transdifferentiating bud cells and stably lasted in undifferentiated adult cells without affecting H3K27me3. A transdifferentiation-related gene external signal-regulated kinase heavily underwent H3K4me3 in developing buds, which could be reproduced by retinoic acid. These results indicate that in P. misakiensis, TC14-3-driven H3K27 trimethylation is a default state of bud and zooid cells, which serves as the histone code for cell longevity.

Here, we investigated the association between leukocyte telomere length (LTL) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content in elderly and explored possible intermediate mechanisms by determining the gene expression profile of candidate genes in the telomere-mitochondrial axis of ageing.Among 166 non-smoking elderly, LTL, leukocyte mtDNA content and expression of candidate genes: sirtuin1 (SIRT1), tumor protein p53 (TP53), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3-coactivator1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3-coactivator1\u03b2 (PGC-1\u03b2), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1) and nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NRF2), using a quantitave real time polymerase chain assay (qPCR). Statistical mediation analysis was used to study intermediate mechanisms of the telomere-mitochondrial axis of ageing.LTL correlated with leukocyte mtDNA content in our studied elderly (r\u00a0=\u00a00.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0047). SIRT1 gene expression correlated positively with LTL (r\u00a0=\u00a00.26, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0094) and leukocyte mtDNA content (r\u00a0=\u00a00.43, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The other studied candidates showed significant correlations in the telomere-mitochondrial interactome but not independent from SIRT1. SIRT1 gene expression was estimated to mediate 40% of the positive association between LTL and leukocyte mtDNA content.The key finding of our study was that SIRT1 expression plays a pivotal role in the telomere-mitochondrial interactome.",

By measuring and manipulating sphingolipid metabolism using pharmacological and genetic tools in Caenorhabditis elegans, we provide evidence that the synthesis and remodeling of specific ceramides (e.g., dC18:1\u2013C24:1), gangliosides (e.g., GM1\u2013C24:1), and sphingomyelins (e.g., dC18:1\u2013C18:1) influence development rate and lifespan. We found that the levels of fatty acid chain desaturation and elongation in many sphingolipid species increased during development and aging, with no such changes in developmentally-arrested dauer larvae or normal adults after food withdrawal (an anti-aging intervention). Pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNAs directed against serine palmitoyl transferase and glucosylceramide synthase acted to slow development rate, extend the reproductive period, and increase lifespan. In contrast, worms fed an egg yolk diet rich in sphingolipids exhibited accelerated development and reduced lifespan. Our findings demonstrate that sphingolipid accumulation and remodeling are critical events that determine development rate and lifespan in the nematode model, with both development rate and aging being accelerated by the synthesis of sphingomyelin, and its metabolism to ceramides and gangliosides.",

Physical activity levels were assessed using a questionnaire. Grip strength was measured using a handheld dynamometer and usual walking speed was measured over 4-m. The results suggest that a reduction in physical activity would not only degrade physical performance, but it would further reduce physical activity through declines in physical performance. As both physical activity and physical performance impact frailty, improvement of physical activity could help reduce frailty directly as well as indirectly via improved physical performance. Our findings support a priori hypothesis that feed-forward loops are present in the phenotype of frailty, which is due to dysregulated energetics. A methodologically broader implication is that we introduce modeling and analysis of feed-forward loop data here. The feed-forward loop, as we define it, is different from the concept of feedback loops used in biochemical systems. Generalizing our model of two-variable feed-forward loop, three, four or multivariable feed-forward loop can be applied to other biological systems.",

Both transporters have similar but not identical expression patterns. In brain regions with an established blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), ABCB1 and ABCC1 were ubiquitously expressed in endothelial cells of the microvasculature and in a subset of larger blood vessels (mostly venules). Remarkably, both transporters were also found in fenestrated capillaries in circumventricular organs where the BBB is absent. Moreover, ABCB1 and ABCC1 were also expressed in various non-endothelia cells such as pericytes, astrocytes, choroid plexus epithelia, ventricle ependymal cells, and neurons. With regard to their neuronal expression it was shown that both transporters are located in specific nerve cell populations, which are also immunopositive for three putative cell markers of purinergic cell signalling, namely 5\u2032-nucleotidase, adenosine deaminase and nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-2.

The function and duration of such transplanted livers are apparently comparable to those from young donors, suggesting that, despite some morphological and structural age-related changes, no major functional changes do occur in liver with age. We tested this hypothesis by performing a comprehensive study on proteasomes, major cell organelles responsible for proteostasis, in liver biopsies from heart-beating donors. Oxidized and poly-ubiquitin conjugated proteins did not accumulate with age and the three major proteasome proteolytic activities were similar in livers from young and old donors. Analysis of proteasomes composition showed an age-related increased of \u03b25i/\u03b14 ratio, suggesting a shift toward proteasomes containing inducible subunits and a decreased content of PA28\u03b1 subunit, mainly in the cytosol of hepatocytes. Thus our data suggest that, proteasomes activity is well preserved in livers from aged donors, concomitantly with subtle changes in proteasome subunit composition which might reflect the occurrence of a functional remodelling to maintain an efficient proteostasis. Gender differences are emerging and they deserve further investigations owing to the different aging trajectories between men and women.

Tumor necrosis factor Receptor Associated Protein 1 (TRAP1), the mitochondrial analog of Hsp75, regulates levels of reactive oxygen species in vitro and is found expressed at higher levels in tumor cells where it is thought to play a pro-survival role. While TRAP1-directed compartmentalized protein folding is a promising target for cancer therapy, its role at the organismal level is unclear. Here we report that overexpression of TRAP1 in Drosophila extends healthspan by enhancing stress resistance, locomotor activity and fertility while depletion of TRAP1 has the opposite effect, with little effect on lifespan under both conditions. In addition, modulating TRAP1 expression promotes the nuclear translocation of homeobox protein Dve and increases expression of genes associated with the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), indicating an activation of this proteostasis pathway. Notably, independent genetic knockdown of components of the UPRmt pathway dampen the enhanced stress resistance observed in TRAP1 overexpression flies. Together these studies suggest that TRAP1 regulates healthspan, potentially through activation of the UPRmt.",

Using a recently validated measure of PD involving the calculation of a multivariate distance (DM) from biomarker data, we show that PD trajectories predict mortality, frailty, and chronic diseases (cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes). Specifically, relative risks of outcomes associated with individual slopes in (i.e. rate of) dysregulation range 1.20\u20131.40 per unit slope. We confirm the results by replicating the analysis using two suites of biomarkers selected with markedly different criteria and, for mortality, in three longitudinal cohort-based studies.

Heat shock response (HSR) protects the cells against accumulation of damaged proteins after exposure to elevated temperatures and also in aging cells. To understand the role of Hsp70 in regulating life span of Daphnia, we examined the expression of Hsp70 in two ecotypes that exhibit strikingly different life spans. Daphnia pulicaria, the long lived ecotype, showed a robust Hsp70 induction as compared to the shorter lived Daphnia pulex. Interestingly, the short-lived D. pulex isolates showed no induction of Hsp70 at the mid point in their life span. In contrast to this, the long-lived D. pulicaria continued to induce Hsp70 expression at an equivalent age. We further show that the Hsp70 expression was induced at transcriptional level in response to heat shock. The transcription factor responsible for Hsp70 induction, heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), although present in aged organisms did not exhibit DNA-binding capability.

Rapamycin also extends lifespan in experimental animals. Because AICAR is a relatively weak activator of p53, we investigated whether stimulation of p53 by the strong activator actinomycin D is also sensitive to the inhibitory effect of rapamycin. In A549 lung cancer cells, activation of p53 by actinomycin D was associated with phosphorylation of p53 on Ser46. Rapamycin inhibited the accumulation of phospho-Ser46 p53, attenuated upregulation of some p53 target genes, and altered cell-cycle progression. Moreover, in cells exposed to actinomycin D, rapamycin attenuated the accumulation of PML, a protein that in some conditions stimulates Ser46 phosphorylation. However, Ser46 phosphorylation was not diminished in PML-knockdown cells, suggesting that in our system PML does not play a major role in stimulating p53 phosphorylation on Ser46. Knockdown of p53 diminished the upregulation of PML by stress-inducing agents, consistent with the idea that PML is a p53-regulated gene. Our data suggest that the attenuation of p53 phosphorylation on Ser46 may play a significant role in the biological activity of anti-aging rapamycin.",

     "abstract": "Clonally expanded mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations resulting in focal respiratory chain deficiency in individual cells are proposed to contribute to the ageing of human tissues that depend on adult stem cells for self-renewal; however, the consequences of these mutations remain unclear. A good animal model is required to investigate this further; but it is unknown whether mechanisms for clonal expansion of mtDNA mutations, and the mutational spectra, are similar between species. Here we show that mice, heterozygous for a mutation disrupting the proof-reading activity of mtDNA polymerase (PolgA+/mut) resulting in an increased mtDNA mutation rate, accumulate clonally expanded mtDNA point mutations in their colonic crypts with age. This results in focal respiratory chain deficiency, and by 81 weeks of age these animals exhibit a similar level and pattern of respiratory chain deficiency to 70-year-old human subjects. Furthermore, like in humans, the mtDNA mutation spectrum appears random and there is an absence of selective constraints. Computer simulations show that a random genetic drift model of mtDNA clonal expansion can accurately model the data from the colonic crypts of wild-type, PolgA+/mut animals, and humans, providing evidence for a similar mechanism for clonal expansion of mtDNA point mutations between these mice and humans.",

However, for more complex cancers, existing multistage models are less convincing. To fill this gap, I hypothesize that neoplasms preferentially arise when stem cell exhaustion creates a short supply of progenitor cells at ages of high proliferative demand. To test this hypothesis, published datasets were employed to model the age distribution of osteochondroma, a benign lesion, and osteosarcoma, a malignant one. The supply of chondrogenic stem-like cells in femur growth plates of children and adolescents was evaluated and compared with the progenitor cell demand of longitudinal bone growth. Similarly, the supply of osteoprogenitor cells from birth to old age was compared with the demands of bone formation. Results show that progenitor cell demand-to-supply ratios are a good risk indicator, exhibiting similar trends to the unimodal and bimodal age distributions of osteochondroma and osteosarcoma, respectively. The hypothesis also helps explain Peto's paradox and the finding that taller individuals are more prone to cancers and have shorter lifespans. The hypothesis was tested, in the manner of Knudson, by its ability to convincingly explain and demonstrate, for the first time, a bone tumour's bimodal age-incidence curve.",

Aging is characterized by aberrant immune responses, including impaired wound healing and increased cancer risk. The behavior and polarized phenotype of tissue macrophages are distinct between young and old organisms. The balance of M1 and M2 macrophages is altered in the aged tissue microenvironment, with a tilt towards an M2-dominant macrophage population, as well as its associated signaling pathways. These M2-type responses may result in unresolved inflammation and create an environment that impairs wound healing and is favorable for cancer growth. We discuss the concept that exercise training can improve the regulation of macrophage polarization and normalize the inflammatory process, and thereby exert anticancer effects and enhance wound healing in older humans.",

Inflamm-aging, i.e. chronic low-grade inflammation during aging, is commonly characterized by pro-inflammatory biomarkers. However, most studies use just one marker at a time, sometimes leading to conflicting results due to complex interactions among the markers. A multidimensional approach allows a more robust interpretation of the various relationships between the markers. We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to 19 inflammatory biomarkers from the InCHIANTI study. We identified a clear, stable structure among the markers, with the first axis explaining inflammatory activation (both pro- and anti-inflammatory markers loaded strongly and positively) and the second axis innate immune response. The first but not the second axis was strongly correlated with age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.56, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.08 p\u00a0=\u00a00.053), and both were strongly predictive of mortality (hazard ratios per PCA unit (95% CI): 1.33 (1.16\u20131.53) and 0.87 (0.76\u20130.98) respectively) and multiple chronic diseases, but in opposite directions. Both axes were more predictive than any individual markers for baseline chronic diseases and mortality. These results show that PCA can uncover a novel biological structure in the relationships among inflammatory markers, and that key axes of this structure play important roles in chronic disease.",

The primary goal of this study was to obtain N-glycan profiles of human placental membrane proteins using a reliable, simple and high-throughput method. The second goal was to examine whether the N-glycan profile alters during gestation. Placental membrane proteins were isolated from women of different ages after first and third trimesters of pregnancy. The N-glycan fingerprint of membrane proteins was obtained using DNA sequencer-assisted fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis (DSA-FACE). Lectin blotting was used to confirm DSA-FACE results. Observed gestation-related alterations were: greater abundance of core-fucosylated and multiantennary N-glycans, but lower amounts of bisected biantennary N-glycans together with a decrease in \u03b12,3-sialylation. Age-related alterations were: more core Fuc and more \u03b12,3-Sia in first trimester placentas from older women than in those from younger women; also less core Fuc and less \u03b12,6-Sia in third trimester placentas from older women compared to those from younger women.

In order to assess the activity of each mitochondrial complex, several different substrates were tested and the rate of oxidative phosphorylation measured. Aging does not affect mitochondrial activity except in the F344 rat adrenal cortex where the maximal ADP-stimulated oxidative phosphorylation decreased with age.

We report three experiments using the blowfly Calliphora stygia, where this theory was tested by manipulation of dietary fat profile. Although the fat profile of the larval diet resulted in small alterations of individual membrane fatty acids, it had no effect on the peroxidation index (PI) of membrane lipids and furthermore had no effect on maximum lifespan. Similarly, manipulation of the fat profile of the adult diet resulted in small changes in individual fatty acids, but had no effect on the PI of membrane lipids. There was a small increase in maximum lifespan when adult diet was supplemented with PUFA in form of vegetable oils but no effect when diet was supplemented with pure PUFA. This difference is possibly due to antioxidant content of vegetable oils. The relative refractoriness of membrane PI to dramatic changes in response to diet is similar to the situation in the rat. These results also indicate the blowfly is unable to convert 18-carbon PUFA to more highly polyunsaturated 20- and 22-carbon PUFA.",

However, there are concerns about possible adverse effects of iron supplements, either in relation to pro-inflammatory effects in the gut or inappropriate tissue iron deposition.

Specific dietary patterns, like the Mediterranean diet, may be more beneficial than a high consumption of single nutrients or specific food items. A strong link between vascular risk factors and dementia has been shown, and the association of diet with several vascular and metabolic diseases is well known.

The effect of resistance-type exercise training with or without protein supplementation on cognitive functioning in frail and pre-frail elderly people was assessed in a secondary analysis. Two 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled intervention studies were carried out in parallel. Subjects performed a resistance-type exercise program of two sessions per week (n\u00a0=\u00a062) or no exercise program (n\u00a0=\u00a065). In both studies, subjects were randomly allocated to either a protein (2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a015\u00a0g daily) or a placebo drink. Cognitive functioning was assessed with a neuropsychological test battery focusing on the cognitive domains episodic memory, attention and working memory, information processing speed, and executive functioning. In frail and pre-frail elderly, resistance-type exercise training in combination with protein supplementation improved information processing speed (changes in domain score 0.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51 versus \u22120.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 in the non-exercise group, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

The initiating events of the inflammatory cascade promoting a greater AT inflammatory profile are not completely understood. Nutrients may determine changes in the amount of body fat, in its distribution as well as in AT function with some nutrients showing a pro-inflammatory effect on AT. Evidences are sparse and quite controversial with only a few studies performed in older subjects.

Systems biology has helped in identifying the mediators and pathways involved in these phenomena, mainly through the application of high-throughput screening methods, valued for their molecular comprehensiveness. Nevertheless, inflammation and metabolic regulation are dynamical processes whose behavior must be understood at multiple levels of biological organization (molecular, cellular, organ, and system levels) and on multiple time scales.

Many characteristics of the traditional Okinawan diet are shared with other healthy dietary patterns, including the traditional Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, and Portfolio diet. All these dietary patterns are associated with reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, among other age-associated diseases. Overall, the important shared features of these healthy dietary patterns include: high intake of unrefined carbohydrates, moderate protein intake with emphasis on vegetables/legumes, fish, and lean meats as sources, and a healthy fat profile (higher in mono/polyunsaturated fats, lower in saturated fat; rich in omega-3). The healthy fat intake is likely one mechanism for reducing inflammation, optimizing cholesterol, and other risk factors. Additionally, the lower caloric density of plant-rich diets results in lower caloric intake with concomitant high intake of phytonutrients and antioxidants. Other shared features include low glycemic load, less inflammation and oxidative stress, and potential modulation of aging-related biological pathways. This may reduce risk for chronic age-associated diseases and promote healthy aging and longevity.",

CSB is essential for genome maintenance and has numerous interaction partners with established roles in different DNA repair pathways including transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair. Here, we describe a new interaction partner for CSB, the DNA glycosylase NEIL2. Using both cell extracts and recombinant proteins, CSB and NEIL2 were found to physically interact independently of DNA. We further found that CSB is able to stimulate NEIL2 glycosylase activity on a 5-hydroxyl uracil lesion in a DNA bubble structure substrate in vitro. A novel 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyA) specific incision activity of NEIL2 was also stimulated by CSB. To further elucidate the biological role of the interaction, immunofluorescence studies were performed, showing an increase in cytoplasmic CSB and NEIL2 co-localization after oxidative stress. Additionally, stalling of the progression of the transcription bubble with \u03b1-amanitin resulted in increased co-localization of CSB and NEIL2. Finally, CSB knockdown resulted in reduced incision of 8-hydroxyguanine in a DNA bubble structure using whole cell extracts.

Many studies have been performed in aged C57BL/6 mice; however, analyses of the age-related changes that occur at a gene expression level and transcriptional profile in vascular tissue have not been elucidated in depth. To determine the changes of the vascular transcriptome, we conducted gene expression microarray experiments on aortas of adult and old mice, in which age-related vascular dysfunction was confirmed by increased stiffness and associated systolic hypertension. Our results highlight differentially expressed genes overrepresented in Gene Ontology categories. Molecular interaction and reaction pathways involved in vascular functions and disease, within the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) pathway, the renin-angiotensin system and the detoxification systems are displayed. Our results provide insight to an altered gene expression profile related to age, thus offering useful clues to counteract or prevent vascular aging and its detrimental consequences.",

     "abstract": "The effect of aging on natural killer cell homeostasis is not well studied in humans or in animal models. We compared natural killer (NK) cells from young and aged mice to investigate age-related defects in NK cell distribution and development. Our findings indicate aged mice have reduced NK cells in most peripheral tissues, but not in bone marrow. Reduction of NK cells in periphery was attributed to a reduction of the most mature CD11b+ CD27\u2212 NK cells. Apoptosis was not found to explain this specific reduction of mature NK cells. Analysis of NK cell development in bone marrow revealed that aged NK cells progress normally through early stages of development, but a smaller percentage of aged NK cells achieved terminal maturation. Less mature NK cells in aged bone marrow correlated with reduced proliferation of immature NK cells. We propose that advanced age impairs bone marrow maturation of NK cells, possibly affecting homeostasis of NK cells in peripheral tissues. These alterations in NK cell maturational status have critical consequences for NK cell function in advanced age: reduction of the mature circulating NK cells in peripheral tissues of aged mice affects their overall capacity to patrol and eliminate cancerous and viral infected cells.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) exists in multiple copies per cell and is essential for oxidative phosphorylation. Depleted or mutated mtDNA promotes numerous human diseases and may contribute to aging. Reduced TORC1 signaling in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extends chronological lifespan (CLS) in part by generating a mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) signal that epigenetically alters nuclear gene expression. To address the potential requirement for mtDNA maintenance in this response, we analyzed strains lacking the mitochondrial base-excision repair enzyme Ntg1p. Extension of CLS by mtROS signaling and reduced TORC1 activity, but not caloric restriction, was abrogated in ntg1\u0394 strains that exhibited mtDNA depletion without defects in respiration. The DNA damage response (DDR) kinase Rad53p, which transduces pro-longevity mtROS signals, is also activated in ntg1\u0394 strains. Restoring mtDNA copy number alleviated Rad53p activation and re-established CLS extension following mtROS signaling, indicating that Rad53p senses mtDNA depletion directly. Finally, DDR kinases regulate nucleus-mitochondria localization dynamics of Ntg1p. From these results, we conclude that the DDR pathway senses and may regulate Ntg1p-dependent mtDNA stability. Furthermore, Rad53p senses multiple mitochondrial stresses in a hierarchical manner to elicit specific physiological outcomes, exemplified by mtDNA depletion overriding the ability of Rad53p to transduce an adaptive mtROS longevity signal.",

A proportion of splicing factors are regulated during ageing by mechanisms involving the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) gene, but the factors that determine the remaining proportion have yet to be identified.DNA methylation is known to be an important regulatory mechanism of gene expression. We assessed age-associated methylation and expression levels for 27 splicing factor genes, in peripheral blood samples from the InCHIANTI study. Examination of splicing patterns at specific loci was examined in a second cohort, the Exeter 10000 study.27/502 methylation probes in 17 different genes were associated with age. Most changes were not associated with transcript expression levels or splicing patterns, but hypomethylation of the SF3B1 promoter region was found to mediate 53% of the relationship between age and transcript expression at this locus (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).DNA methylation does not appear to play a major role in regulation of the splicing factors, but changes in SF3B1 expression may be attributable to promoter hypomethylation at this locus.

We compared the effectiveness of four previously proposed criteria (Franceschi et al., 2000, Evert et al., 2003, Gondo et al., 2006, Andersen-Ranberg et al., 2001) in 1160 phenotypically fully characterized Italian siblings of 90 years of age and older (90+, mean age: 93 years; age range: 90\u2013106 years) belonging to 552 sib-ships, recruited in Northern, Central and Southern Italy within the EU-funded project GEHA, followed for a six-year-survival. Main findings were: (i) \u201chealthy\u201d subjects varied within a large range, i.e. 5.2% (Gondo), 8.7% (Evert), 17.7% (Franceschi), and 28.5% (Andersen-Ranberg); (ii) Central Italy subjects showed better health than those from Northern and Southern Italy; (iii) mortality risk was correlated with health status independently of geographical areas; and (iv) 90+ males, although fewer in number, were healthier than females, but with no survival advantage. In conclusion, we identified a modified version of Andersen-Ranberg criteria, based on the concomitant assessment of two basic domains (cognitive, SMMSE; physical, ADL), called \u201cSimple Model of Functional Status\u201d (SMFS), as the most effective proxy to distinguish healthy from not-healthy subjects.

Short-term CR blunted the increased glomerular volume, the degree of fibrosis, p16 and the positive rate of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase staining of the kidneys in old ad libitum group. Light chain 3/Atg8 as an autophagy marker exhibited a marked decline in aged kidneys, which was increased by short-term CR. The levels of p62/SQSTM1 and polyubiquitin aggregates, which were increased in older kidneys, were blunted by short-term CR. Short-term CR retarded the level of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine, a marker of mitochondrial DNA oxidative damage. Moreover, we found an increased level of SIRT1 and AMPK, and a decreased level of mTOR in aged kidneys after short-term CR. These results suggested that short-term CR could be considered as a potential intervention for retardation of renal senescence by increasing autophagy and subsequently reducing oxidative damage. Three master regulators of energy metabolism, SIRT1, AMPK and mTOR are associated with these effects.",

The ATM protein is a PI3kinase family member best known for its role in the DNA damage response. While repair of DNA damage is a critical function that every CNS neuron must perform, a growing body of evidence indicates that the full range of ATM functions includes some that are unrelated to DNA damage yet are essential to neuronal survival and normal function. For example, ATM participates in the regulation of synaptic vesicle trafficking and is essential for the maintenance of normal LTP. In addition ATM helps to ensure the cytoplasmic localization of HDAC4 and thus maintains the histone \u2018code\u2019 of the neuronal genome by suppressing genome-wide histone deacetylation, which alters the message and protein levels of many genes that are important for neuronal survival and function. The growing list of ATM functions that go beyond its role in the DNA damage response offers a new perspective on why individuals with A-T express such a wide range of neurological symptoms, and suggests that not all A-T symptoms need to be understood in the context of the DNA repair process.",

     "abstract": "The repair of damaged DNA is essential to maintain longevity of an organism. The brain is a matrix of different neural cell types including proliferative astrocytes and post-mitotic neurons. Post-mitotic DNA repair is a version of proliferative DNA repair, with a reduced number of available pathways and most of these attenuated. Base excision repair (BER) is one pathway that remains robust in neurons; it is this pathway that resolves the damage due to oxidative stress. This oxidative damage is an unavoidable byproduct of respiration, and considering the high metabolic activity of neurons this type of damage is particularly pertinent in the brain. The accumulation of oxidative DNA damage over time is a central aspect of the theory of aging and repair of such chronic damage is of the highest importance. We review research conducted in BER mouse models to clarify the role of this pathway in the neural system. The requirement for BER in proliferating cells also correlates with high levels of many of the BER enzymes in neurogenesis after DNA damage. However, the pathway is also necessary for normal neural maintenance as larger infarct volumes after ischemic stroke are seen in some glycosylase deficient animals. Further, the requirement for DNA polymerase \u03b2 in post-mitotic BER is potentially more important than in proliferating cells due to reduced levels of replicative polymerases. The BER response may have particular relevance for the onset and progression of many neurodegenerative diseases associated with an increase in oxidative stress including Alzheimer's.",

Astrocyte biology has been examined using molecular, biochemical and structural methods, as well as 3D brain imaging in live animals and humans. Exosomes are extracelluar membrane vesicles that facilitate communication between glia, and have significant potential for biomarker discovery and drug delivery. Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes may indirectly influence the structure and function of membrane proteins expressed in glial cells and predispose specific cell subgroups to degeneration. Physical exercise may reduce or retard age-related brain deterioration by a mechanism involving neuro-glial processes. It is most likely that additional information about the distribution, structure and function of glial cells will yield novel insight into human brain ageing. Systematic studies of glia and their functions are expected to eventually lead to earlier detection of ageing-related brain dysfunction and to interventions that could delay, reduce or prevent brain dysfunction.",

However, the mechanisms explaining the effects of H. pylori infection are not fully elucidated. H. pylori infection is known to induce genetic instability in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of gastric epithelial cells. The mutagenic effect of H. pylori infection on nuclear DNA is known to be a consequence, in part, of a down-regulation of expression and activity of major DNA repair pathways. In this study, we demonstrate that H. pylori infection of gastric adenocarcinoma cells causes mtDNA mutations and a decrease of mtDNA content. Consequently, we show a decrease of respiration coupled ATP turnover and respiratory capacity and accordingly a lower level and activity of complex I of the electron transport chain. We wanted to investigate if the increased mutational load in the mitochondrial genome was caused by down-regulation of mitochondrial DNA repair pathways. We lowered the expression of APE-1 and YB-1, which are believed to be involved in mitochondrial base excision repair and mismatch repair. Our results suggest that both APE-1 and YB-1 are involved in mtDNA repair during H. pylori infection, furthermore, the results demonstrate that multiple DNA repair activities are involved in protecting mtDNA during infection.",

Furthermore, Pol\u03b2 transcriptional expression was significantly lower in transgenic 12 months old mice than in wt.

Our candidate genes act in pathways implicated in aging and longevity, including neurodegeneration, cognitive function, lipid metabolism, DNA repair, and genome maintenance. By implementing custom-designed Agilent SureSelect target capture and next-generation sequencing, we discovered a total of 89 novel non-synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) and validated 51 nsSNPs by iPLEX MassArray assays. Genotyping analysis of these novel SNPs in 410 Ashkenazi Jewish controls and 390 centenarians showed significant enrichment (5.3 fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) of the p.Y318C variant in PMS2 and significant depletion (7.5 fold, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) of the p.V465A variant in GABRR3 in centenarians compared to controls.

Their activity is highly dependent on the availability of ATP and forms a directed energy-exporter network, linking decreased mitochondrial function with highly impaired ABC transporter activity and disease progression.

Here, we compared tolerance of the M. smegmatis strains to genotoxic stress (ROS and RNI) under aerobic, hypoxic and recovery conditions of growth by monitoring their survival. We show an increased susceptibility of mycobacteria to genotoxic stress under hypoxia. UvrB deficiency led to high susceptibility of M. smegmatis to the DNA damaging agents. Ung was second in importance in strains with single deficiencies. Interestingly, we observed that while deficiency of UdgB had only a minor impact on the strain's susceptibility, its combination with Ung deficiency resulted in severe consequences on the strain's survival under genotoxic stress suggesting a strong interdependence of different DNA repair pathways in safeguarding genomic integrity. Our observations reinforce the possibility of targeting DNA repair processes in mycobacteria for therapeutic intervention during active growth and latency phase of the pathogen.

As it seems plausible to explain the origin of sarcopenia through a motor neuron degeneration model, the focus of sarcopenia research should combine neuroscience with the study of the original myocyte and satellite cells. Although a complete mechanism underlying the development of sarcopenia has yet to be elucidated, we propose that the primary trigger of sarcopenia could be gliogenic in origin based on the close relationship between the glia, neurons and non-neural cells, for example, the motor unit and its associated glia in both the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS).

Potential regulators of splicing factor expression were investigated by siRNA analysis.Approximately one third of splicing factors demonstrated age-related transcript expression changes in two human populations. Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) transcript expression correlated with splicing factor expression in human microarray data. Senescent primary fibroblasts and endothelial cells also demonstrated alterations in splicing factor expression, and changes in alternative splicing. Targeted knockdown of the ATM gene in primary fibroblasts resulted in up-regulation of some age-responsive splicing factor transcripts.We conclude that isoform ratios and splicing factor expression alters with age in vivo and in vitro, and that ATM may have an inhibitory role on the expression of some splicing factors.

Second, genetic studies have also shown that mice, whose growth hormone function is genetically modified (GM), grow slower and live longer than their wild-type siblings. Despite a wealth of empirical data, still largely missing is a theoretical framework that specifies and makes quantitative predictions on this trade-off. Here, I present a mechanistic model based on the principles of energy conservation. The model quantifies explicitly how DR and GM alter the animal's energy budget, and channel metabolic energy to somatic maintenance by suppressing growth, thereby extending lifespan. Data from a diverse set of empirical studies on small rodents supports the predictions of the model. More importantly, the model reveals that although DR and GM are two different methods to extend lifespan, i.e., environmental vs. genetic, the underlying mechanisms of them are the same from the energetic viewpoint.",

     "abstract": "Age-related changes in stem cells could have a profound impact on tissue aging and the development of age-related diseases such as cancer. However, the effects of metformin, a recently recognized anti-cancer drug, on stem cell aging remain largely unknown. In the present study, an experiment was set up to investigate the underlying mechanism of metformin's beneficial effects on age-related changes in intestinal stem cells (ISCs) derived from Drosophila midgut. Results showed that metformin reduced age- and oxidative stress-related accumulation of DNA damage marked by Drosophila \u03b3H2AX foci and 8-oxo-dG in ISCs and progenitor cells. Metformin also inhibited age and- oxidative stress-related ISC hyperproliferation as well as intestinal hyperplasia. Our study further revealed that the inhibitory effects of metformin on DNA damage accumulation may be due to the down-regulation of age-related and oxidative stress-induced AKT activity. These data indicate that metformin has beneficial effects on age-related changes in ISCs derived from Drosophila midgut. Further, our results suggest a possible impact of DNA damage on stem cell genomic instability, which leads to the development of age-related diseases. Additionally, our study suggests that Drosophila midgut stem cells can be a suitable model system for studying stem cell biology and stem cell aging.",

In the present study we show that lack of CB1 receptors leads to a significant increase in lipofuscin accumulation and a reduced expression and activity of cathepsin D, lysosomal protease implicated in the degradation of damaged macromolecules, in the hippocampus of 12-month-old mice. The impaired clearance of damaged macromolecules due to the low cathepsin D levels and not enhanced oxidative stress may be responsible for the lipofuscin accumulation because macromolecule oxidation levels were comparable between the genotypes within the same age group. The altered levels of autophagy markers p62 and LC3-II suggest that autophagy is upregulated in CB1 knockout mice. Increased autophagic flux in the absence of CB1 receptors is probably a compensatory mechanism to partially counteract decreased lysosomal degradation capacity. Together, these results suggest that CB1 receptor activity affects lysosomal activity, degradation of damaged macromolecules and thus it may influence the course and onset of brain aging.",

However, the mechanisms underlying activation of xenobiotic genes remain largely unknown. Here we showed that although farnesoid X receptor (FXR, Nr1h4) mRNA levels do not change significantly, FXR protein levels are elevated in the livers of the long-lived Little mice, leading to increased DNA binding activity of FXR. Hepatic FXR expression is sex-dependent in wild-type mice but not in Little mice, implying that up-regulation of FXR might be dependent on the reduction of growth hormone in Little mice. Growth hormone treatment decreased hepatic expression of FXR and xenobiotic genes Abcb1a, Fmo3 and Gsta2 in both wild-type and Little mice, suggesting an association between FXR and xenobiotic gene expression. We found that Abcb1a is transactivated by FXR via direct binding of FXR/retinoid X receptor \u03b1 (RXR\u03b1) heterodimer to a response element at the proximal promoter. FXR also positively controls Fmo3 and Gsta2 expression through direct interaction with the response elements in these genes. Our study demonstrates that xenobiotic genes are direct transcriptional targets of FXR and suggests that FXR signaling may play a critical role in the lifespan extension observed in Little mice.",

Large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+(MaxiK) channel, with pore-forming \u03b1-subunit and modulatory \u03b21-subunit, is a key regulator of vascular tone. This study explored functional and molecular evidence of MaxiK alteration with aging in the mesenteric artery(MA). Young, Middle-aged, and Old male Wistar rats were used. Selective MaxiK channel blocker (Iberiotoxin) induced a significant increase of vascular tension in MA in all three age groups. However, these effects were greatly decreased in Old animals. The amplitude and frequency of spontaneous transient outward currents were significantly decreased with aging. Single channel recording revealed that aging induced a decrease of the open probability and the mean open time, but an increase of the mean closed time of MaxiK channel. The Ca2+/voltage sensitivity of MaxiK was also decreased. Western blotting showed that the protein expression of MaxiK \u03b21- and \u03b1-subunit was significantly reduced with aging, and the suppression of \u03b21 subunits was larger than that of \u03b1 subunits. These data suggest that aging decreases capability of MaxiK channel in regulating vascular tone in the MA, which may be partially mediated by unparallel downregulation of \u03b1- and \u03b21-subunit expression.",

There was no differential fertility between bright and dim individuals, suggesting that dim worms were not excessively frail. Worms with high hsp-16.2::gfp expression had improved mobility, consistent with improved health span. We predicted that the increased longevity of the bright worms would be associated with increased expression of protective genes such as those shown to be upregulated in Age mutants. However, few genes were differentially transcribed, although internal controls (hsp-16.2 and family members) were differentially expressed. Quite surprising was the observation that expression level of the transgenic reporter was inherited by the progeny: in seven experiments bright worms consistently produced progeny that were brighter. We tested and ruled out possible artifacts such as differential copy-number of the transgene as an explanation of this differential brightness. These results suggest that a robust physiological state does not depend heavily upon transcriptional differences for its establishment, consistent with proteostatic mechanisms underlying the differential longevity.",

We tested the hypothesis that spermidine, a nutrient associated with the anti-aging process autophagy, would improve arterial aging. Aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, was \u223c20% greater in old (O, 28 months) compared with young C57BL6 mice (Y, 4 months, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Arterial endothelium-dependent dilation (EDD), a measure of endothelial function, was \u223c25% lower in O (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs. Y) due to reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. These impairments were associated with greater arterial oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine), superoxide production, and protein cross-linking (advanced glycation end-products, AGEs) in O (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Spermidine supplementation normalized aPWV, restored NO-mediated EDD and reduced nitrotyrosine, superoxide, AGEs and collagen in O. These effects of spermidine were associated with enhanced arterial expression of autophagy markers, and in vitro experiments demonstrated that vascular protection by spermidine was autophagy-dependent. Our results indicate that spermidine exerts a potent anti-aging influence on arteries by increasing NO bioavailability, reducing oxidative stress, modifying structural factors and enhancing autophagy.

Sexual dimorphism in renal cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS) activity was observed in control mice but not in Snell dwarfs. Instead, female Snell mice exhibited \u223c2-fold higher CBS activity, comparable to levels seen in male Snell dwarf and in control mice. Taurine levels were significantly higher in kidney and brain of Snell dwarf versus control mice. Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) was higher in liver of Snell dwarfs, and the higher concentration of its product, S-adenosylmethionine, was correlated with elevated global DNA methylation status. Application of a mathematical model for methionine metabolism revealed that the metabolite perturbations in Snell dwarfs could be explained by decreased methionine transport, increased MAT and increased methyltransferase activity.

After 4 weeks of age, we noted the gradual establishment of sex-dependent hypomethylation in each of these genes in either males or females. The exposure of male mice to female-like growth hormone (GH) profile repressed male-predominant hypomethylation and promoted female-predominant hypomethylation. The occurrence of age-dependent hypomethylation, including at loci for which we also observed sex-dependent changes in DNA methylation, was accompanied by the downregulation of DNMT3A/B. In addition, we found that age-dependent hypomethylation was promoted through liver regeneration induced by partial hepatectomy, suggesting that DNMT activities were not enough to retain methylation levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that sex-dependent GH profiles influence the age-progressive hypomethylation under decreased DNMT3A/B levels in certain regions of the genome.",

The fusion protein is as highly conserved as CSB, suggesting that it is advantageous in health; however, expression of the fusion protein in CSB-null cells induces a constitutive interferon (IFN) response. The fusion protein binds in vivo to PGBD3-related MER85 elements, but is also tethered to c-Jun, TEAD1, and CTCF motifs by interactions with the cognate transcription factors. The fusion protein regulates nearby genes from the c-Jun (and to a lesser extent TEAD1 and CTCF) motifs, but not from MER85 elements. We speculate that the fusion protein interferes with CSB-dependent chromatin remodeling, generating double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that induces an IFN response through endosomal TLR or cytoplasmic RIG-I and/or MDA5 RNA sensors. We suggest that the fusion protein was fixed in primates because an elevated IFN response may help to fight viral infection.

Studies using cells from patients and mouse models have shown that the CSB protein is involved in a variety of cellular pathways and plays a major role in the cellular response to stress. CSB has been shown to regulate processes such as the transcriptional recovery after DNA damage, the p53 transcriptional response, the response to hypoxia, the response to insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), transactivation of nuclear receptors, transcription of housekeeping genes and the transcription of rDNA. Some of these processes are also affected in combined XP/CS patients.

Taken together, the data demonstrate that CSA and CSB, in addition to their established role in transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair, can modulate the base excision repair (BER) of oxidized DNA bases both directly (by interaction with BER proteins) and indirectly (by modulating the expression of the DNA repair genes). Both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA repair is affected by mutations in CSA and CSB genes. However, the observed retardations of repair and the resulting accumulation of unrepaired endogenously generated DNA lesions are often mild, thus pointing to the relevance of additional roles of the CS proteins, e.g. in the mitochondrial response to oxidatively generated DNA damage and in the maintenance of gene transcription.",

Endogenous reactive oxygen is considered as an ultimate cause of DNA damage that contributes to Cockayne syndrome pathology.

Although the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is well known as a particularly suitable model for genetic manipulations, it has been recently used in a number of pharmacological studies searching for compounds with anti-aging activity. These compound screens are regularly performed in amphipathic solvents like dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the solvent of choice for high-throughput drug screening experiments performed throughout the world. In this work, we report that exposing C. elegans to DMSO in liquid extends lifespan up to 20%. Interestingly, another popular amphipathic solvent, dimethyl formamide (DMF), produces a robust 50% increase in lifespan. These compounds work through a mechanism independent of insulin-like signaling and dietary restriction (DR). Additionally, the mechanism does not involve an increased resistance to free radicals or heat shock suggesting that stress resistance does not play a major role in the lifespan extension elicited by these compounds.

In myometrium, the presence of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels has been detected and they could be a factor in regulating uterine quiescence in pregnancy and contractions during labour. Here, we have examined a possibility of ageing-mediated regulation of KATP channels in the human myometrium. Myometrial samples were taken from non-pregnant women undergoing hysterectomy (n\u00a0=\u00a034) and from women undergoing caesarean section in late pregnancy (n\u00a0=\u00a036). Real time RT-PCR revealed that mRNAs of all known KATP channel subunits were present in the human myometrium. In non-pregnant myometrium, ageing up-regulated SUR2B/Kir6.1, subunits forming KATP channels in this tissue, without affecting the expression of other channel subunits. In the late pregnant myometrium, the level of subunits that do not form functional KATP channels was not affected by age within 20\u201341 age range. However, uterine SUR2B and Kir6.1 were up-regulated in parturient over 35 years. An ageing-induced increase in those channel subunits was confirmed by Western blotting. Thus, this study suggests that KATP channels are up-regulated with increasing age in human myometrium. This may help explain, at least partially, increased rate of birth complications in women aged over 35 years.",

Cyclisation of l-Asp residues yields four isomers: l-Asp, l-isoAsp, d-Asp and d-isoAsp, however little is known about their rate of formation or interconversion. This is important because PIMT is inactive towards d-isoAsp. Peptides containing the four Asp isoforms corresponding to a susceptible site (Asp 151) in the chaperone, \u03b1A-crystallin, were examined for their interconversion at pH 7. d-Asp formed from l-Asp readily, whereas l-isoAsp was not detected until significantly later. d-isoAsp formed very slowly, with just 1% present after 8 days at 60\u00a0\u00b0C. These findings can be used to rationalise the substrate specificity of PIMT. In addition, both the d-isoAsp and l-isoAsp peptides were found to be remarkably stable, showing little conversion to other isomers, even after weeks of incubation. Therefore l-isoAsp and d-isoAsp appear to represent \u201cterminal\u201d stages of l-Asp modification. If PIMT is present, l-isoAsp may be reverted to l-Asp, however there appears to be no prospect of reversing d-isoAsp formation in aged proteins.

This cellular state can be reached by replicative loss of telomeres or certain stresses in cell culture and is characterized by the termination of cell division; however, the cells remain metabolically active. To identify metabolites that are characteristic for senescent cells, extracts of human embryonic lung fibroblast (WI-38 cell line) have been investigated with NMR spectroscopy. Three different types of senescence have been characterized: replicative senescence, DNA damage-induced senescence (etoposide treatment) and oncogene-induced senescence (hyperactive RAF kinase). The metabolite pattern allows (I) discrimination of senescent and control cells and (II) discrimination of the three senescence types. Senescent cells show an increased ratio of glycerophosphocholine to phosphocholine independent from the type of senescence. The increase in glycerophosphocholine implicates a key role of phospholipid metabolism in cellular senescence. The observed changes in the choline metabolism are diametrically opposite to the well-known changes in choline metabolism of tumour cells. As tumours responding to chemotherapeutic agents show a \u201cglycerophosphocholine-to-phosphocholine switch\u201d i.e. an increase in glycerophosphocholine, our metabolic data suggests that these malignant cells enter a senescent state emphasizing the role of senescence in tumour suppression.",

     "abstract": "Despite the long held hypothesis that oxidant stress results in accumulated oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules and subsequently to aging and age-related chronic disease, it has been difficult to consistently define and specifically identify markers of oxidant stress that are consistently and directly linked to age and disease status. Inflammation because it is also linked to oxidant stress, aging, and chronic disease also plays an important role in understanding the clinical implications of oxidant stress and relevant markers. Much attention has focused on identifying specific markers of oxidative stress and inflammation that could be measured in easily accessible tissues and fluids (lymphocytes, plasma, serum). The purpose of this review is to discuss markers of oxidant stress used in the field as biomarkers of aging and age-related diseases, highlighting differences observed by race when data is available. We highlight DNA, RNA, protein, and lipid oxidation as measures of oxidative stress, as well as other well-characterized markers of oxidative damage and inflammation and discuss their strengths and limitations. We present the current state of the literature reporting use of these markers in studies of human cohorts in relation to age and age-related disease and also with a special emphasis on differences observed by race when relevant.",

     "abstract": "Aging is a biological process associated with impairment of mitochondrial bioenergetic function, increased oxidative stress, attenuated ability to respond to stresses and increased risk in contracting age-associated diseases. When mitochondria are subjected to oxidative stress, accompanied by calcium overload and ATP depletion, they undergo \u201ca permeability transition\u201d, characterized by sudden induced change of the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability for water as well as for low-molecular weight solutes (\u22641.5\u00a0kDa), resulting in membrane depolarization and uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. Research interest in the entity responsible for this phenomenon, the \u201cmitochondrial permeability transition pore\u201d (MPTP) has dramatically increased after demonstration that it plays a key role in the life and death decision in cells. The molecular structure and identity of MPTP is not yet known, although the pore is thought to exist as multiprotein complex. Some evidence indicate that the sensitivity of mitochondria to Ca2+-induced MPTP opening increases with aging; however the basis of this difference is unknown. Changes in MPTP structure and/or function may have important implications in the aging process and aged-associated diseases. This article examines data relevant to this issue. The important role of a principal lipidic counter-partner of the MPTP, cardiolipin, will also be discussed.",

Here, we characterize the cell cycle expression pattern of Cdt1 and Geminin during successive passages of primary fibroblasts and compare it to tumour-derived cell lines. Cdt1 and Geminin are strictly expressed in distinct subpopulations of young fibroblasts, similarly to cancer cells, with Geminin accumulating shortly after the onset of S phase. Cdt1 and Geminin are down-regulated when primary human and mouse fibroblasts undergo replicative or stress-induced senescence. RNAi-mediated Geminin knock-down in human cells enhances the appearance of phenotypic and molecular features of senescence. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts heterozygous for Geminin exhibit accelerated senescence compared to control fibroblasts. In contrast, ectopic expression of Geminin in mouse embryonic fibroblasts delays the appearance of the senescent phenotype.

Cigarette smoking has also been associated with sarcopenia, the age-related loss of muscle mass and strength. In order to investigate the cellular mechanisms by which cigarette smoke (CS) promotes muscle catabolism, C2 myotubes from an in vitro skeletal muscle cell line, were exposed to different levels of whole vapor phase CS using a controlled CS exposure apparatus. Exposure of C2 myotubes to CS caused a reduction in diameter of myotubes and a time- and dose-dependent degradation of myosin heavy chain. Also, CS exposure resulted in increased intracellular oxidative stress and p38 MAPK phosphorylation, which led to up-regulation of the muscle specific E3 ubiquitin ligases: MAFbx/atrogin-1 and MuRF1. Pretreatment with the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine and inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 prevented CS induced catabolism. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that exposure of skeletal myotubes to CS leads to increased oxidative stress and activation of the p38 MAPK pathway resulting in muscle cell atrophy and breakdown of muscle protein mediated by muscle specific E3 ubiquitin ligases. Our findings provide a possible molecular mechanism for the catabolic effects of CS in skeletal muscle.",

Previously, we demonstrated IDD in a murine model of a progeroid syndrome caused by reduced expression of a key DNA repair enzyme. This led us to hypothesize that DNA damage promotes IDD. To test our hypothesis, we chronically exposed adult wild-type (Wt) and DNA repair-deficient Ercc1\u2212/\u0394 mice to the cancer therapeutic agent mechlorethamine (MEC) or ionization radiation (IR) to induce DNA damage and measured the impact on disc structure. Proteoglycan, a major structural matrix constituent of the disc, was reduced 3\u20135\u00d7 in the discs of MEC- and IR-exposed animals compared to untreated controls. Expression of the protease ADAMTS4 and aggrecan proteolytic fragments was significantly increased. Additionally, new PG synthesis was reduced 2\u20133\u00d7 in MEC- and IR-treated discs compared to untreated controls. Both cellular senescence and apoptosis were increased in discs of treated animals. The effects were more severe in the DNA repair-deficient Ercc1\u2212/\u0394 mice than in Wt littermates. Local irradiation of the vertebra in Wt mice elicited a similar reduction in PG. These data demonstrate that genotoxic stress drives degenerative changes associated with IDD.",

     "abstract": "In women as well as in mice, oocytes exhibit decreased developmental potential (oocyte quality) with advanced age. Our current data implicate alterations in the levels of oocyte ceramide and associated changes in mitochondrial function and structure as being prominent elements contributing to reduced oocyte quality. Both ROS levels and ATP content were significantly reduced in aged oocytes. The decreased in ROS levels are of intrigue because it is contrary to what has been previously reported. Lowered levels of both ROS and ATP indicate diminished mitochondrial function that was accompanied by alterations in mitochondrial structure. Interestingly, developmental potential of old oocytes was improved by microinjection of mitochondria isolated from young oocytes. Co-treatment of aged oocytes with ceramide and a cytoplasmic lipid carrier (l-carnitine) improved both mitochondrial morphology and function, and totally rescued spontaneous in vitro fragmentation. In addition, ceramide localization was altered in old oocytes possibly due to downregulation of the ceramide transport protein (CERT). However, knockdown of CERT alone was not sufficient to increase young oocyte's susceptibility to death, because the sequential manipulation of ceramide levels (its chronic decrease, followed by downregulation of CERT, and finally a ceramide spike) were all necessary to replicate the aging phenotype. These results indicate that oocyte aging is due to a multiplicity of events; and that with increasing biological age, changes in levels of both ceramide and its transport protein contribute to deterioration of oocyte mitochondrial structure and function. Hence, those changes may represent potential targets to manipulate when attempting to ameliorate aging phenotypes in germ cells.",

As aging is accompanied by a significant decline in proteasomal proteolysis in primary human T lymphocytes, we evaluated the contributory role of USP14 in this decline. Our studies for the first time demonstrate that enzymatic activity of proteasome-associated USP14 is significantly higher in T cells obtained from elderly donors. Additionally, such an increase in USP14 activity could be mimicked by chemically inhibiting the proteasome, using lactacystin. Thus, USP14 activity appears to be reciprocally regulated by the catalytic function of the 26S proteasome. To determine whether the inhibition of USP14 activity counter regulates proteasomal proteolysis, T cells pretreated with a small molecule inhibitor of USP14, IU1, were activated and assessed for I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation as a measure of proteasomal proteolysis. While T cells obtained from young donors demonstrated increased degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1, those from the elderly remained unaffected by IU1 pretreatment. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the decrease in proteolysis of proteasomal substrates during aging is independent of the increased USP14 activity and that the reciprocal regulation of USP14 and proteasomal catalytic activity may be necessary to maintain cellular ubiquitin homeostasis.",

Here, we investigate the mechanisms of takeout-dependent longevity.takeout overexpression specifically in the fat body is sufficient to increase fly longevity and is additive to the longevity effects of Dietary Restriction. takeout long-lived flies do not show phenotypes often associated with increased longevity, such as enhanced stress resistance or major metabolic abnormalities. However, males exhibit greatly diminished courtship behavior, leading to a reduction in fertility. Interestingly, takeout contains a binding domain for Juvenile Hormone, a fly hormone that plays a role in the regulation of developmental transitions. Importantly, the longevity and courtship phenotypes of takeout overexpressing flies are reversed by treatment with the Juvenile Hormone analog methoprene.These data suggest that takeout is a key player in the tradeoff-switch between fertility and longevity. takeout may control fertility via modulation of courtship behavior. This regulation may occur through Juvenile Hormone binding to takeout and a subsequent reduction in Juvenile Hormone signaling activity.",

In response to 30\u00a0\u03bcM H2O2, levels of the ER stress proteins BiP, ATF6 and pEIF2\u03b1 were significantly increased within 4\u00a0h of exposure.

Application of 10 and 30\u00a0\u03bcM (+)-pentazocine, a sigma 1 receptor agonist, significantly inhibited the H2O2 induced cell death. (+)-Pentazocine also suppressed the oxidative stress induced reduction of pro-caspase 12 and suppressed the induction of the ER stress proteins BiP and EIF2\u03b1. When applied to cultured human lenses, (+)-pentazocine protected against apoptotic cell death, LDH release and against H2O2 induced opacification.

Decline of p400 ATPase in senescent IMR-90 cells prompted us to investigate structural changes in the chromatin of the p21 promoter during in vitro aging. Whereas doxorubicin treatment in early-passaged cells results in nucleosome density changes near the p53 binding sites of the p21 promoter, our studies show that senescent cells with a high p21 transcription activity had a comparable nucleosome distribution as unstressed young cells. However, H2A.Z that is highly enriched within the p21 promoter of young cells is depleted in senescent cells, suggesting that downregulation of p400 and loss of H2A.Z localisation play roles in relieving p21 gene repression in senescent IMR-90 cells.

Using long-living, thermosensory mutants of C. elegans, we tested whether the temperature dependency of the mean lifespan is compatible with the Arrhenius equation, which typically represents one of the chemical reaction rate theories. The temperature dependency of C. elegans was the Arrhenius type or normal, but daf-2(e1370) mutants were quite different from the others. However, taking into account the effect of the thermal denaturation of DAF-2 with the temperature, we showed that our analyzed results are compatible with previous ones. We investigated the timing mechanism of one parameter (the onset of biodemographic aging (t0)) in the lifespan equation by applying the RNAi feeding method to daf-2 mutants in order to suppress daf-16 activity at different times during the life cycle. In summary, we further deepened the biological role of two elements, t0 and z (the inverse of the aging rate), in the lifespan equation and mean lifespan formulated by our diffusion model z2\u00a0=\u00a04Dt0, where z is composed of t0 and D (the diffusion constant).",

This study determined whether responses to ET-1 differed in retinal arterioles isolated from adult (2\u20133 months) and aged (>20 months) Fischer 344 rats of both sexes. Risk factors for retinal disease (retinal perfusion pressure, intraocular pressure, blood glucose) were not affected by age. However, sensitivity to ET-1 declined with age, especially in females. Vasoconstrictor responses to 50\u00a0mM KCl and Ca2+ release by caffeine (10\u00a0mM) were similar in all groups. Retinal ETA and ETB receptor expression also was similar in young and aged rats, regardless of sex. Contractions elicited by 10\u00a0nM ET-1 were inhibited by the ETA antagonist BQ-123 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) in all groups. In contrast, the ETB antagonist BQ-788 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) restored ET-1-induced contractions in aged female vessels, but had no effect in any other group. Removal of the endothelium also restored contractions in vessels from aged females but not males. Thus, responsiveness to ET-1 declines with age in retinal microvasculature. In males, this is likely mediated by age-related changes in the ETA receptor signaling pathway. By contrast, effects of ET-1 on endothelial ETB receptors attenuate vasoconstrictor responses in aged females.",

However, little is known about age-related changes in the mitochondrial response to elevated ROS in vivo. Significantly, ROS-induced uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation has received attention as a negative feedback mechanism to reduce mitochondrial superoxide production. Here we use a novel in vivo spectroscopy system to test the hypothesis that ROS-induced uncoupling is diminished in aged mitochondria. This system simultaneously acquires 31P magnetic resonance and near-infrared optical spectra to non-invasively measure phosphometabolite and O2 concentrations in mouse skeletal muscle. Using low dose paraquat to elevate intracellular ROS we assess in vivo mitochondrial function in young, middle aged, and old mice. Oxidative phosphorylation was uncoupled to the same degree in response to ROS at each age, but this uncoupling was associated with loss of phosphorylation capacity and total ATP in old mice only. Using mice lacking UCP3 we demonstrate that this in vivo uncoupling is independent of this putative uncoupler of skeletal muscle mitochondria. These data indicate that ROS-induced uncoupling persists throughout life, but that oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial deficits and loss of ATP in aged organisms that may contribute to impaired function and degeneration.",

The regeneration of the oral siphon (OS) involves wound healing, blastema formation, cell proliferation, and replacement of 8 oral pigment organs (OPO), the latter via differentiation and migration of stem/precursor cells from localized niches in the siphon. The restoration of OPO pattern during OS regeneration occurs with a high degree of accuracy through three successive cycles of amputation. It is shown here that oral siphons of the largest and oldest members of a wild Ciona population do not completely regenerate their siphons after amputation. The loss of regeneration capacity was accompanied by reduced cell proliferation. In contrast to arrested OS outgrowth, the stem/precursor cells responsible for OPO replacement \u201cover-differentiate\u201d after OS amputation in the oldest animals, the typical number of OPO is increased from 8 to 12\u201316, and malformed OPO are produced. Also in contrast to younger animals, the oldest animals of the population show arrested OPO development after two consecutive cycles of amputation and regeneration. We conclude that there is a size and age threshold in Ciona after which the regenerative capacity of the OS is compromised due to effects of aging on cell proliferation.",

Levels of 3-NT rose rapidly with age in Tg brain homogenate whereas normal controls maintained constant lower levels. The age-related slope for 3-NT was 3.6-fold steeper in untreated Tg compared to treated Tg (p\u00a0<\u00a00.009), although treated Tg showed elevation in youth. Opposite to Tg, treated Nr mice had reduced 3-NT in youth (p\u00a0<\u00a00.02).The age-related pattern of mitochondrial 3-NT in Nr mice was parabolic (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005). Remarkably, levels in treated Nr were reduced by \u223c50% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0007). Untreated Tg showed strongly increasing mitochondrial 3-NT with higher mitochondrial activity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) whereas treated Tg showed lower nitrosylation at higher levels of mitochondrial activity.

Genetic polymorphisms in the Uncoupling Protein 3 (UCP3) gene, whose product is mainly expressed in skeletal muscle, were suggested to be associated with hand grip (HG) performances in elderly populations. Considering the population specificity of the quality of aging, we aimed to add further support to this evidence by analyzing the association between four SNPs in the UCP3 gene and relative haplotypes in two large cohorts of middle aged (N\u00a0=\u00a0708) and oldest old Danes (N\u00a0=\u00a0908). We found that the variability at rs1685354 and rs11235972 was associated with HG levels both at single and haplotypic level in both cohorts. Furthermore, taking advantage of large cohort and period survival data of the oldest cohort, we tested the association of each SNP with survival at 10\u00a0years from the baseline visit. Interestingly, we found that allele A at rs11235972, associated in this cohort with lowest HG scores, influences also the survival patterns, with people carrying this allele showing higher mortality rates. On the whole, our work supports the role of UCP3 gene in functional status and survival at old age.",

We found a linear age-related decline in CS, DS and HS/H, the first one being the predominant plasma GAG during ageing. The possible deleterious effect of oxidative phenomenon on proteins\u2019 and proteoglycans\u2019 metabolism during ageing process was analyzed by plasma carbonyls (PCO) and thiols (PSH) as well as by total antioxidant capacity (TAS). An age-dependent increase in PCO and decrease in PSH concentrations were found, both strongly correlated with decreasing with age plasma TAS. Intensity of glycation was assessed by circulating N\u025b-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and endogenous secretory receptor for AGE (esRAGE), both of them founding associated with ageing. Moreover, all markers of oxidative and AGE-mediated damage correlated with CS and DS level and could be contributing factors to age-related changes of these GAG types. Thus, plasma CS and DS could become promising biomarkers of human ageing to date, owning to its close association with oxidative status and glycation processes.",

Exogenous overexpression of p21Waf1/Cip1 demethylated p16Ink4a and restored its expression, which induced cell growth arrest and senescence. While in non-tumorigenic immortalized cells, the Ink4a loci and adjacent genomic DNA were found to be deleted.These data suggest that the loss of p16Ink4a function by either genomic DNA deletion or methylation have been adopted by senescent WS MEFs escaping from senescence, with distinct tumorigenic consequences. The fact that cells that had escaped senescence via the spontaneous biallelic deletion of the Ink4a loci could not form tumors suggests that the functional loss of p16Ink4aper se might not be sufficient for tumorigenesis; most likely, it is a byproduct and passenger mutation. The mutations in factors regulating p16Ink4a methylation might be the driver mutation. These findings shed light on the strategy of anti-aging by regulating p16Ink4a expression.",

Expression of 27/56 (InCHIANTI) and 19/44 (SAFHS) genes were associated with age after correction for multiple testing. 8 genes were robustly associated with age in both cohorts.

EVOO effects on health are often attributed to its unique mixture of phenolic compounds with tyrosol and hydroxityrosol being the most biologically active. Although these compounds have been extensively studied in terms of their antioxidant potential and its role in different pathologies, their actual connection with longevity remains unexplored. This study utilized the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the possible effects of tyrosol in metazoan longevity. Significant lifespan extension was observed at one specific tyrosol concentration, which also induced a higher resistance to thermal and oxidative stress and delayed the appearance of a biomarker of ageing. We also report that, although tyrosol was efficiently taken up by these nematodes, it did not induce changes in development, body length or reproduction. In addition, lifespan experiments with several mutant strains revealed that components of the heat shock response (HSF-1) and the insulin pathway (DAF-2 and DAF-16) might be implicated in mediating tyrosol effects in lifespan, while caloric restriction and sirtuins do not seem to mediate its effects. Together, our results point to hormesis as a possible mechanism to explain the effects of tyrosol on longevity in C. elegans.",

The disease is caused by mutations in the WRN gene which encodes a DNA helicase/exonuclease which is involved in multiple aspects of DNA metabolism. Current methods mostly rely on radiometric techniques to assess WRN exonuclease activity. Here we present an alternative, quantitative approach based on non-radioactive isotope dilution mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS). A oligoduplex substrate mimicking the telomeric sequence was used for method development. Released nucleotides, which correlate with the degree of oligoduplex degradation, were dephosphorylated, purified, and quantified by LC\u2013MS/MS. Heavy-isotope-labeled internal standards were used to account for technical variability. The method was validated in terms of reproducibility, time-course and concentration-dependency of the reaction. As shown in this study, the LC\u2013MS/MS method can assess exonuclease activity of WRN mutants, WRN's substrate and strand specificity, and modulatory effects of WRN interaction partners and posttranslational modifications. Moreover, it can be used to analyze the selectivity and processivity of WRN exonuclease and allows the screening of small molecules for WRN exonuclease inhibitors. Importantly, this approach can easily be adapted to study nucleases other than WRN. This is of general interest, because exonucleases are key players in DNA metabolism and aging mechanisms.",

We detected that ageing brings about a specific increase in insulin receptor tyrosine phosphatase activity and PTP1B serine phosphorylation. Increased association of PTP1B and leukocyte common antigen-related tyrosine protein phosphatase (LAR) with insulin receptor was also observed in hypothalamus from aged rats. Besides these mechanisms, increased activation of the IKK\u03b2-NF\u03baB pathway, p38 and PKC\u03b8 serine/threonine kinases were also detected. These data contribute to explain the hypothalamic insulin resistance associated with ageing.

Age was inversely associated with LTL (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.10, P\u00a0=\u00a00.31 in Cretan men and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.19, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02 in Dutch men). In all men LTL was not related to indicators of oxidative stress and plasma antioxidants. However, the endogenous antioxidants serum albumin (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.18, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and uric acid (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.13, P\u00a0=\u00a00.045) were positively associated with LTL. The age-adjusted difference between Crete and Zutphen was reduced by 25% after adjustment for serum albumin and uric acid. We conclude that Greek elderly men have significantly longer LTL compared to Dutch counterparts. The endogenous antioxidants albumin and uric acid were positively associated with longer telomeres.",

Using the method of Tukey, we established five categories summarizing the summer daily conditions of mortality (exceptionally high values, minor extremely high values, common values, minor extremely low values, and exceptionally low values).Whatever the mortality conditions during the summer months, the mortality trajectories by age are exponential for both sexes: males die twice more than females at the age of 65 and their level of mortality linearly converges around the age of 97 to that of the females.Being male remains a major risk factor of mortality during heat waves. This issue was missed by previous epidemiological studies because almost all of them focused only on the relative increase in mortality and not on the sex specific mortality rates which implies being able to estimate the population at risk.",

However, whether both mTOR and SIRT1 are involved in high glucose-inducing mesangial cells (MCs) senescence still remains to be explored. Hence we investigate the potential functional interrelationship between these two proteins in high glucose-inducing MCs senescence. High glucose increased mTOR expression and activity, but decreased SIRT1 expression and activity. The level of mTOR was increased significantly, while the SIRT1 expression and activity was declined significantly with serial cell culture passage. The siRNA-SIRT1 and nicotinamide promoted MCs senescence. NAD or resveratrol arrested high glucose-inducing MCs senescence. Meanwhile, the effects of NAD or resveratrol on high glucose-inducing MCs senescence were also completely blocked by SiRNA-SIRT1. Rapamycin arrested MCs senescence induced by high glucose and prevented MCs senescence with serial cell culture passage, and meanwhile increased the SIRT1 expression and activity. Moreover, the effects of rapamycin on MCs senescence induced by high glucose were also completely blocked by treating cells with niacinamide or siRNA-SIRT1. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that SIRT1 is required for the effects of rapamycin on high glucose-inducing MCs senescence.",

In the present study, we identified gene response patterns from which plausible mechanisms responsible for the observed effects on life span might be inferred. Functional clustering analysis of the transcriptome data revealed that biological processes affected by GCLc in young flies (10\u00a0days) were generally related to cell morphogenesis and differentiation, while those in older flies were associated with nucleosome organization and detoxification processes. Notably, in older flies there was considerable reduction in the expression of genes related to humoral immunity in the GCLc over-expressors and this was observed in flies of the same chronological age (\u223c40\u00a0days old flies) and in flies of equivalent physiological age (10% dead for both experimentals and controls). Our study demonstrates that most of the GSH-mediated processes and targets are relatively distinct in young and old flies.

Evidence suggests that deletion of p66Shc could partially attenuate weight gain on a high fat diet by increasing energy expenditure. However, the impact of p66Shc on the metabolic response to calorie restriction (CR) has not been determined. Thus, we used indirect respiration calorimetry to determine the impact of CR on energy expenditure (EE) and substrate utilization (RQ) in 18mo p66Shc(\u2212/\u2212) and wild-type (WT) mice. Calorimetry measurements were completed at baseline and following 3\u00a0d of 40% CR and 2\u00a0mo of 26% CR. There was no difference (P\u00a0>\u00a00.10) in EE and RQ between gentoypes, regardless of how EE data was normalized. Both p66Shc(\u2212/\u2212) and WT mice showed decreases (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in EE normalized for body weight at 2\u00a0mo of CR.

The shelterin subunits TRF1 and TRF2 bind in a sequence-specific manner to double-stranded telomeric DNA, providing a vital platform for recruitment of additional shelterin proteins as well as non-shelterin factors crucial for the maintenance of telomere length and structure. Both TRF1 and TRF2 are engaged in multiple roles at telomeres including telomere protection, telomere replication, sister telomere resolution and telomere length maintenance. Regulation of TRF1 and TRF2 in these various processes is controlled by post-translational modifications, at times in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, affecting key functions such as DNA binding, dimerization, localization, degradation and interactions with other proteins. Here we review the post-translational modifications of TRF1 and TRF2 and discuss the mechanisms by which these modifications contribute to the function of these two proteins.",

Moreover, the senescence of HCT116 cells was accompanied by autophagy, that was confirmed by electron microscopy observations of autophagosomes in the curcumin-treated cells as well as LC3-II expression, punctue staining of LC3 and increased content of acidic vacuoles. Inhibition of autophagy, due to the diminished expression of ATG5 by RNAi decreased the number of senescent cells induced by curcumin, but did not lead to increased cell death. Altogether, we demonstrated a new antitumor activity of curcumin leading to cancer cell senescence and revealed the presence of a functional link between senescence and autophagy in curcumin-treated cells.",

Oxidative stress-related signals and some microRNAs affect the differentiation potential shift of MSC by directly targeting key regulatory factors such as Runx-2 or PPAR-\u03b3, and energy metabolism pathway is involved as well.

We used miRNA-seq by the Illumina platform to quantify and compare the temporal miRNA expression profiles in the brain of a short-lived (GRZ) and a longer-lived strain (MZM) of the annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri. We used fuzzy-c-means clustering to group miRNAs with similar profiles. In MZM, we found tumor suppressors with known negative interactions with MYC and/or positive interactions with TP53 among up-regulated miRNAs (e.g. miR-23a, miR-26a/b, miR-29a/b and miR-101a) in aged animals. Conversely, we found oncogenes which are MYC targets among down-regulated miRNAs (miR-7a, members of miR cluster 17\u223c92). These latter were previously shown to be regulated in human replicative aging. In addition, three regulated miRNAs (miR-181c, miR-29a and miR-338) are known to be age-regulated and to globally contribute to regulation of their targets in the human brain. Therefore, there appears to be a degree of evolutionarily conservation in age-dependent miRNA expression between humans and N. furzeri. GRZ showed specific regulation of some miRNAs, notably a marked up-regulation of miR-124, a miRNA important for neuronal differentiation. The two strains differ in their miRNA expression profiles already at sexual maturity. Short lifespan in GRZ could therefore be \u2013 at least partially \u2013 due to dysregulated miRNA expression.",

Sixteen EP lines corresponding to 15 genes significantly extended lifespan when their target genes were driven by da-Gal4. In each case, the target genes were seen to be over-expressed. Independently derived UAS-gene transgenic stocks were available or made for two candidates: ImpL2 which is ecdysone-inducible gene L2, and CG33138, 1,4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme. With both, adult lifespan was increased upon over-expression via the GeneSwitch inducible Gal4 driver system.

Mammals have two types of adipose tissue: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). In this study, proteome analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with MALDI-TOF MS, and subsequent analyses were performed on both WAT and BAT from 9-month-old male rats fed ad libitum or subjected to CR for 6 months. Our findings suggest that CR activates mitochondrial energy metabolism and fatty acid biosynthesis in WAT. It is likely that in CR animals WAT functions as an energy transducer from glucose to energy-dense lipid. In contrast, in BAT CR either had no effect on, or down-regulated, the mitochondrial electron transport chain, but enhanced fatty acid biosynthesis. This suggests that in CR animals BAT may change its function from an energy consuming system to an energy reservoir system. Based on our findings, we conclude that WAT and BAT cooperate to use energy effectively via a differential response of mitochondrial function to CR.",

Treatment with either an iron chelator (deferoxamine) or over-expression of ftn-1, encoding the iron sequestering protein ferritin, increased resistance to t-BOOH and, in the latter case, reduced protein oxidation, but did not increase lifespan. Expression of ftn-1 is greatly increased in long-lived daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor mutants. In this context, deletion of ftn-1 decreased t-BOOH resistance, but enhanced both daf-2 mutant longevity and constitutive dauer larva formation, suggesting an effect of ferritin on signaling. These results show that high levels of iron can increase molecular damage and reduce lifespan, but overall suggest that iron levels within the normal physiological range do not promote ageing in C. elegans.",

Other rats were euthanized 30\u00a0min after training, and CREB and pCREB expression levels were examined in the hippocampus, amygdala, and piriform cortex using immunohistochemistry. CREB levels decreased with age in the hippocampus and amygdala. After training with either shock level, young rats exhibited good memory and increases in pCREB levels in the hippocampus and amygdala. Aged rats exhibited good memory for the moderate but not the low shock but did not show increases in pCREB levels after either shock intensity. These results suggest that decreases in total CREB and in pCREB activation in the hippocampus and amygdala may contribute to rapid forgetting in aged rats. After moderate foot shock, the stable memory in old rats together with absence of CREB activation suggests either that CREB was phosphorylated in a spatiotemporal pattern other than analyzed here or that the stronger training conditions engaged alternate mechanisms that promote long-lasting memory.",

     "abstract": "Insulin resistance develops with aging in rats in parallel to fat mass accretion, central leptin resistance and hyperleptinemia. Previous studies demonstrated that insulin resistance appears earlier in adipose tissue than in muscle during aging and pointed to a role of hyperleptinemia in the impairment of insulin action. Here we explored the evolution along aging of insulin sensitivity in soleus and EDL muscles by analyzing insulin signaling in vivo and insulin-dependent glucose transport ex vivo. A decrease in insulin action was observed in both muscles. Caloric restriction improves insulin sensitivity at early aging but not in older animals. We also tested the role of leptin on insulin action in skeletal muscle. Short-term pretreatment with leptin inhibits in vivo muscle insulin signaling and insulin-dependent glucose transport in isolated muscle strips. This effect is mediated by its action on early insulin signaling as well as by the inhibition of p38. In contrast, chronic central administration of leptin elicits an insulin sensitizing effect on soleus. These data suggest that leptin can act as muscle insulin sensitizer, when acting at central level, and as insulin antagonistic when interacting directly with soleus muscle. This effect may be relevant in situations of hyperleptinemia such as aging.",

Isc1p functions upstream of the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase Sit4p through the modulation of ceramide levels. Here, we show that both ceramide and loss of Isc1p lead to the activation of Hog1p, the MAPK of the high osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway that is functionally related to mammalian p38 and JNK. The hydrogen peroxide sensitivity and premature aging of isc1\u0394 cells was partially suppressed by HOG1 deletion. Notably, Hog1p activation mediated the mitochondrial dysfunction and catalase A deficiency associated with oxidative stress sensitivity and premature aging of isc1\u0394 cells. Downstream of Hog1p, Isc1p deficiency activated the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway. Deletion of the SLT2 gene, which encodes for the MAPK of the CWI pathway, was lethal in isc1\u0394 cells and this mutant strain was hypersensitive to cell wall stress. However, the phenotypes of isc1\u0394 cells were not associated with cell wall defects. Our findings support a role for Hog1p in the regulation of mitochondrial function and suggest that constitutive activation of Hog1p is deleterious for isc1\u0394 cells under oxidative stress conditions and during chronological aging.",

Sea urchins grow indeterminately, reproduce throughout their life span and some species exhibit negligible senescence. Using a microarray and qRT-PCR, age-related changes in gene expression were examined in three tissues (muscle, esophagus and nerve) of the sea urchin species Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. The results indicate age-related changes in gene expression involving many key cellular functions such as the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway, DNA metabolism, signaling pathways and apoptosis. Although there are tissue-specific differences in the gene expression profiles, there are some characteristics that are shared between tissues providing insight into potential mechanisms that promote lack of senescence in these animals. As an example, there is an increase in expression of genes encoding components of the Notch signaling pathway with age in all three tissues and a decrease in expression of the Wnt1 gene in both muscle and nerve. The interplay between the Notch and Wnt pathways may be one mechanism that ensures continued regeneration of tissues with advancing age contributing to the general lack of age-related decline in these animals.",

We tested the effect of deleting sirtuins and several acetyltransferases to find that the role of many of these proteins during grape juice fermentation is the opposite to that under standard laboratory aging conditions using synthetic complete media. For instance, SIR2 deletion extends maximum chronological lifespan in wine yeasts grown under laboratory conditions, but shortens it in winemaking. Deletions of sirtuin HST2 and acetyltransferase GCN5 have the opposite effect to SIR2 mutation in both media. Acetic acid, a well known pro-aging compound in laboratory conditions, does not play a determinant role on aging during wine fermentation. We discovered that gcn5\u0394 mutant strain displays strongly increased aldehyde dehydrogenase Ald6p activity, caused by blocking of Ald6p degradation by autophagy under nitrogen limitation conditions, leading to acetic acid accumulation. We describe how nitrogen limitation and TOR inhibition extend the chronological lifespan under winemaking conditions and how the TOR-dependent control of aging partially depends on the Gcn5p function.",

Isogeny adversely affected both life span and fertility, but w had little or no effect on either trait.

Further, we suggest these pathways are involved in the leukemogenesis of Down syndrome. We have reviewed the role of BER in the processing of oxidative stress, and the impact of folate depletion on BER capacity. Further, we have reviewed the role that loss of BER, specifically DNA polymerase beta, plays in accelerating the rate of aging.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are unavoidable byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation and are the major contributors of endogenous oxidative damage. To prevent the negative effects of ROS, cells have developed DNA repair mechanisms designed to specifically combat endogenous DNA modifications. The base excision repair (BER) pathway is primarily responsible for the repair of small non-helix distorting lesions and DNA single strand breaks. This repair pathway is found in all organisms, and in mammalian cells, consists of three related sub-pathways: short patch (SP-BER), long patch (LP-BER) and single strand break repair (SSBR). While much is known about nuclear BER, comparatively little is known about this pathway in the mitochondria, particularly the LP-BER and SSBR sub-pathways. There are a number of proteins that have recently been found to be involved in mitochondrial BER, including Cockayne syndrome proteins A and B (CSA and CSB), aprataxin (APTX), tryosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), flap endonuclease 1 (FEN-1) and exonuclease G (EXOG). These significant advances in mitochondrial DNA repair may open new avenues in the management and treatment of a number of neurological disorders associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, and will be reviewed in further detail herein.",

     "abstract": "Retinoic acid (RA) is used in differentiation therapy to treat a variety of cancers including neuroblastoma. The contributing factors for its therapeutic efficacy are poorly understood. However, mitochondria (MT) have been implicated as key effectors in RA-mediated differentiation process. Here we utilize the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line as a model to examine how RA influences MT during the differentiation process. We find that RA confers an approximately sixfold increase in the oxygen consumption rate while the rate of glycolysis modestly increases. RA treatment does not increase the number of MT or cause measurable changes in the composition of the electron transport chain. Rather, RA treatment significantly increases the mitochondrial spare respiratory capacity. We propose a competition model for the therapeutic effects of RA. Specifically, the high metabolic rate in differentiated cells limits the availability of metabolic nutrients for use by the undifferentiated cells and suppresses their growth. Thus, RA treatment provides a selective advantage for the differentiated state.",

Our results demonstrate that BER activity in neurons markedly declines with age. The decline in BER could be attributed to decrease in the expression levels and activities of BER enzymes. Supplementing neuronal extracts with uracil DNA-glycosylase (UDG), 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1), apurinic endonuclease 1, pol \u03b2 and T4 DNA ligase independently could not restore the loss of BER activity in adult and old neuronal extracts. However, supplementation of pol \u03b2 in combination of T4 DNA ligase to neuronal extract, improved the BER in adult and old neuronal extracts. Additional supplementation of the extracts with UDG or OGG1 apart from pol \u03b2 and T4 DNA ligase, or with all pure enzymes restored very markedly the loss of BER in aging neurons. These results suggest the age-dependent decline in BER is due to an overall deficiency of the various factors needed for BER but pol \u03b2 and DNA ligase seem to be the most limiting factors.",

FEN1 processes 5\u2032 flaps through a previously unknown, but structurally elegant double-stranded (ds) recognition/single stranded (ss) incision mechanism that both selects for 5\u2032 flaps and selects against ss DNA or RNA, intact dsDNA, and 3\u2032 flaps. Two major DNA binding interfaces, including a K+ bridge between the DNA and the H2TH motif, are spaced one helical turn apart and together select for substrates with dsDNA. A conserved helical gateway and a helical cap protects the two-metal active site and selects for ss flaps with free termini. Structures of substrate and product reveal an unusual step between binding substrate and incision that involves a double base unpairing with incision occurring in the resulting unpaired DNA or RNA. Ordering of the active site requires a disorder-to-order transition induced by binding of an unpaired 3\u2032 flap, which ensures that the product is ligatable. Comparison with FEN superfamily members, including XPG, EXO1, and GEN1, identifies superfamily motifs such as the helical gateway that select for ss\u2013dsDNA junctions and provides key biological insights into nuclease specificity and regulation.",

TopoII\u03b2 deficient granule neurons (CGNT\u0304) show greater sensitivity to N-ethyl N-nitroso urea (ENU)-mediated DNA damage. The cell-free extracts of TopoII\u03b2 knockdown cells (ECGNT\u0304) show a significant decrease in G-U BER activity during ENU-treatment as well as during recovery, suggesting that TopoII\u03b2 promotes G-U BER activity. Since G-U BER activity is not affected in the presence of ICRF-193, catalytic inhibitor of TopoII\u03b2, the activity of enzyme per se may not be participating in BER activity. Further characterization of the activities of BER enzymes present in ECGNT\u0304 shows that uracil DNA-glycosylase (UDG) and ligase (LIG) activities decrease significantly in both ENU treatment and recovery. Supplementation of TopoII\u03b2 to ECGNT\u0304 does not restore ligation activity and ICRF-193 does not influence the LIG activity.

     "abstract": "The most frequent mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation is a 4977\u00a0bp deletion known as the common deletion (mtDNACD4977). mtDNACD4977 is related to skin photo-aging and to chronological aging of cells with high-energy demands such as neurons and muscle cells. The human eye contains both sun-exposed (cornea, iris) and high-energy demand structures (retina). In this study, we employed a highly sensitive quantitative PCR technique to determine mtDNACD4977 occurrence in different structures of the human eye. We found that the cornea, the most anterior structure of the eye, contains the highest amount of mtDNACD4977 (2.6%, 0.25% and 0.06% for the cornea, iris and retina, respectively). Within the cornea, mtDNACD4977 is almost exclusively found in the stroma, the cellular layer conferring transparency and rigidity to the human cornea (8.59%, 0.13% and 0.05% in the stroma, endothelium and epithelium, respectively). Moreover, we show that mtDNACD4977 accumulates with age in the corneal stroma. Taken together, our results suggest that mtDNACD4977 is related to photo-aging rather than chronological aging in the human eye. Similar to the involvement of mtDNACD4977 in skin photo-aging phenotypes, we believe that the clinical manifestations of corneal aging, including clouding and stiffening, are associated with the accumulation of mtDNACD4977 in the corneal stroma.",

We demonstrate that spontaneous loss of folate in the colon results in DNA damage accumulation and aberrant DNA damage responses that may contribute to the increased genomic instability and cancer risk in colon. We find greater than 2-fold changes in the expression of folate-absorption and folate retention genes within the colonocyte, demonstrating that with age the colon is able to induce expression of appropriate genes in response to limiting folate status. However, we also find that aging results in spontaneous accumulation of uracil in colon DNA, indicating that folate status is not fully restored by the increase in folate absorption. Expression of uracil-excising enzymes (Ung and Smug) are induced in response to uracil accumulation, and with age we see an approximate 3-fold increase in the level of expression that is matched by a corresponding increase in DNA polymerase \u03b2 expression. In further evaluating the DNA damage response, we investigated p53 localization and function and find abundant p53 levels, with p53 sequestered almost entirely in the cytoplasm. To determine whether cytoplasmic localization might impact p53 transactivation function, we conducted an unbiased screen of p53-target genes and found that age substantially alters expression of p53-target genes.",

     "abstract": "Age-related increases of body weight and adiposity, indicating dysregulation of food intake/energy expenditure, can be prevented in rodents by long-term 40% caloric restriction. The dorsal vagal complex (DVC), the brainstem center mediating the satiety reflex, has recently emerged as a determinant effector of long-term feeding adaptation. To study the effects of aging and caloric restriction on satiety circuits, leptin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling systems were studied in 2- and 19-month-old ad libitum-fed (AL) and 19-month-old calorie-restricted (CR) rats. Age-induced hyperleptinemia in AL rats was correlated with elevated DVC BDNF immunoreactive concentrations and satiety threshold stability, suggesting functional desensitization of the DVC to these signals. To better understand this phenomenon, mRNA levels of receptor and post-receptor signaling effectors were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Aging selectively increased BDNF receptors and suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) mRNA levels. Caloric restriction prevented age-related increases of serum leptin, DVC BDNF and SOCS-3 mRNA levels, but not those of BDNF receptors. In CR rats, prevention of leptin resistance-promoting SOCS-3 induction was also observed at the protein level. This study suggests that leptin post-receptor targets and BDNF signaling play a role in the establishment of age-related DVC dysfunction.",

We found that repetitive heat treatment induced skin wrinkles after a period of 6 weeks in skin of hairless mice. Histologically, heat treatment resulted in increased thickness of the epidermis and dermis. And repetitive heat treatment resulted in significantly increased expression of MMP-13 protein and mRNA, but not MMP-2 and -9, in skin of hairless mice. We also demonstrated that activities of antioxidant enzymes, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), were reduced by chronic heat treatment. In addition, oxidative damage was increased in skin of mice after chronic exposure to heat shock.Taken together, our results suggested that chronic exposure of the skin to heat can cause skin wrinkling. And, increase of MMP-13, decrease of antioxidant enzymes activity, and consequent oxidative damage by chronic heat treatment may play an important role in development of skin aging in hairless mice.",

Interestingly, SSM had preserved enzyme function and efficiently utilized palmitate. Analysis of IFM CPT1 kinetics showed both diminished Vmax and Km (60% and 49% respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) when palmitoyl-CoA was the substrate. However, no age-related changes in enzyme kinetics were evident with respect to l-carnitine. ALCAR supplementation restored CPT1 activity in heart IFM, but not apparently through remediation of l-carnitine levels.

The bioavailability of the tested flavonoids was demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC/DAD) and a 2-aminoethyl diphenyl borate-based in vivo approach. While all flavonols increased lifespan in wild-type, only myricetin elongated the mev-1(kn1) lifespan, suggesting that the flavonols antioxidant action alone is not sufficient for longevity. Structural prerequisites of high antioxidant action in vitro were also essential to reduce the reactive oxygen species (ROS) load in vivo in C. elegans and were tested in isolated mouse muscle mitochondria. Since the insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS) cascade is a key regulator of lifespan, all compounds were tested for the ability to cause nuclear translocation of the FOXO transcription factor DAF-16 and changes in target gene expression. An increased DAF-16 translocation and sod-3 promoter activity were observed with all flavonoids but was independent of their ROS scavenging capability and their effects on lifespan.",

This impairment of serum and HDL cholesterol efflux capacity was significantly inversely correlated to the AD severity as evaluated by MMSE scores. Results obtained from SR-BI-enriched Fu5AH and ABCA1-enriched J774 cells revealed that AD impaired the interaction of HDL and apoA-I with both the ABCA1 transporter and SR-BI receptor. Purified apoA-I from AD patients also failed to remove free excess cholesterol from ABCA1-enriched J774 macrophages. Interestingly, the decrease in plasma \u03b1-tocopherol content and the increase in MDA formation and HDL relative electrophoretic mobility indicated that AD patients had higher levels of oxidative stress. The anti-inflammatory activity of HDL was also significantly lower in AD patients as measured by the level of ICAM-1 expression.

Metalloprotease 1, NADP-dependent mitochondrial malic enzyme (isoform 2) and citrate synthase were identified by mass spectroscopy to contain HNE/MDA adducts. DBA/2 mice exhibited little effect of age or CR on protein HNE/MDA content in skeletal muscle mitochondria. In contrast, protein-HNE levels in liver mitochondria showed a significant increase with age in AL-fed mice of both strains, and CR caused significant attenuation of this damage.

It is often assumed that these can be compensated for using appropriate controls. We show here that this is not the case for a metabolomic analysis of a long-lived daf-2 mutant strain: not only were the effects of FUdR much greater than the effects of the mutation, there were clear interactions between FUdR and genotype, such that identification of daf-2-dependent metabolites would have been compromised on FUdR plates. This indicates that FUdR should only be used with caution for C. elegans ageing experiments, and should not be assumed to be independent of other factors being studied.",

ROS induce cellular dysfunctions such as stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS), which is believed to contribute to normal organismal aging and play a role in age-related diseases. Consistent with this hypothesis, increased oxidative damage of DNA, proteins, and lipids have been reported in aged animals and senescent cells accumulate in vivo with advancing age. Caveolin-1 acts as a scaffolding protein that concentrates and functionally regulates signaling molecules. Recently, great progress has been made toward understanding of the role of caveolin-1 in stress-induced premature senescence. Data show that caveolin-mediated signaling may contribute to explain, at the molecular level, how oxidative stress promotes the deleterious effects of cellular senescence such as aging and age-related diseases. In this review, we discuss the cellular mechanisms and functions of caveolin-1 in the context of SIPS and their relevance to the biology of aging.",

A reduced supply of energy at the cellular level leads to an increased concentration of AMP, which, in turn, results in LKB1-mediated activation of the AMPK kinase. The activation of the p53 tumor suppressor protein by metabolic stress has been shown to be mediated by AMPK. Increased intracellular AMP can be mimicked by 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR). We showed that AICAR activated the p53 pathway in LKB1-deficient cells. This activation was strongly attenuated by two inhibitors of the ATM kinase (caffeine and Ku-55933), which is dysfunctional in ataxia-telanagiectasia patients. In cells with ATM expression silenced by shRNA, AICAR-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser15 and Ser37 was attenuated. Furthermore, p53 activation by AICAR was blocked by rapamycin, a specific inhibitor of the mTOR kinase, which is a crucial regulator of cell growth. Rapamycin did not block p53 activation by resveratrol, which, in contrast to AICAR, induced the DNA damage response, senescence-like growth inhibition, a high level of post-translational modification of p53, and weak upregulation of MDM2 (the negative regulator of p53). Thus, ATM and mTOR participate in the activation of p53 in response to a compound mimicking metabolic stress.",

Since frailty has been associated with increased fat infiltration in muscle and bone, we hypothesized that lamin A/C, a protein of the nuclear envelope that regulates adipose differentiation, could be associated with the pathophysiology of both osteo and sarcopenia in the frailty syndrome. Four-week-old lamin A/C null (Lmna\u2212/\u2212), heterozygous (Lmna+/\u2212) and wild type (WT) mice were sacrificed and their mid-thigh analyzed for fat infiltration using invasive (histology) and non-invasive (\u03bcCT) methods.

Furthermore, fat infiltration happened concomitantly with a significant decline in muscle and bone strength in Lmna\u2212/\u2212 mice. From a mechanistic approach, high levels of pro-adipogenic factors PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 were associated with a reduction in myogenic and osteogenic factors from the Wnt-10b/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway in Lmna\u2212/\u2212 mice.

This mild-intensity exercise program increased muscle oxygen consumption by soleus and heart in aging rats and reversed age-related long-term spatial learning and memory impairments evaluated in the water maze and step-down inhibitory avoidance tasks. Remarkably, the observed cognitive-enhancing properties of short bouts of exercise were accompanied by the activation of serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) and cAMP response element binding (CREB) pro-survival signaling that culminates in the marked increase on the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression and BDNF protein levels on the hippocampus of aging rats.

Physical ability was evaluated using a self reported scale of 11 questions, while cognitive function was scored by MMSE and a cognitive composite score sensitive to age-related decline.A random intercept model revealed a positive, significant association between LTL and physical ability. For every unit increase in physical ability score, LTL increased by 0.066\u00a0kb (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), equal to approximately three years of age-dependent LTL shortening.

Moreover, the intra-pair difference in LTL was associated with intra-pair difference in physical ability (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), confirming the association.

Such a rate proved to mirror the function of the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) rather than other processes linked to the both oxidative and substrate level phosphorylation. The changes in both Ki for atractyloside and Km for ADP suggest the occurrence of modification of the ANT conformation during aging in which the ANT Vmax was found to decrease in normotensive but to increase under spontaneously hypertension in 24 week-old rats with a subsequent decrease in both cases.

We showed that NK cells from aged mice were reduced and had impaired function and altered phenotype in lungs during influenza infection. Aged NK cells demonstrated decreased IFN-\u03b3 production, but not degranulation, after influenza infection. However, after ex vivo activation with YAC-1 cells, aged NK cells demonstrated both reduced IFN-\u03b3 production and degranulation. IFN-\u03b3 was also reduced in aged NK cells after activation with anti-NKp46 and soluble cytokines. IFN-\u03b2, and IL-12p40 mRNA expression was not significantly different from that observed in adult mice. Analysis of NK cell subsets indicated that aged mice had more immature and less terminally mature NK cells. These data suggest that aging affects the numbers, function and phenotype of NK cells.

     "abstract": "The canonical Wnt pathway plays a critical role in myogenesis and age-related inefficient muscle regeneration. To gain insights into changes in Wnt signaling in muscle during the lifetime of a mouse, mRNA levels of secreted Wnt antagonists were investigated. Among 13 analyzed antagonists, seven genes were found to be down-regulated in skeletal muscles of adult and old mice. Epigenetic modifications at the promoter regions of these seven Wnt antagonists were then examined to understand how these correlate with this transcriptional repression. DNA methylation was stably maintained, while chromatin modifications changed to transcriptionally inactive states over the course of a lifetime. Similar patterns of changes in chromatin modifications were observed at the promoters of all of the studied genes. The observations indicated that an upstream factor might regulate the chromatin states and the transcriptional repression of Wnt antagonists. Several bioinformatic analyses revealed that a FOXD3 binding motif is present within promoter regions of the seven antagonists. Furthermore, age-dependent differential FOXD3 binding is observed at the motifs of the seven gene promoters. Our results suggest that FOXD3 as a potential epigenetic regulator may mediate the transcriptional repression of the seven antagonists, possibly through regulation of histone modifications.",

Meanwhile, NBS1 is phosphorylated by ATM at Serine 278 and Serine 343 and thereby assists the activation of the ATM downstream targets. To study the physiological function of the Nbs1 phosphorylation, we have knocked in a point mutation in the moue genome that results in the replacement of Threonine 278 (equivalent to the human Serine 278) by Alanine. The Nbs1T278A knock-in mice develop normally and show no gross defects. The mutation of this phosphorylation site does not affect the proliferation or genomic stability. Ionizing radiation (IR) of primary Nbs1T278A MEFs reveals no obvious defects in the Chk2 phosphorylation at 1\u00a0Gy, but a delayed phosphorylation of Chk2 and Smc1 only at intermediate (4.5\u00a0Gy) and high (10\u00a0Gy) doses, respectively. In contrast to Serine 343 mutant, Threonine 278 mutation has no effect on the HU-induced ATR-Chk1 activation. Our study thus shows that Nbs1 phosphorylation at the Threonine 278 is dispensable for mouse development and plays a differential function in assisting the DDR of downstream effectors in vivo, depending on the doses of DNA damage.",

It is now clear that brain pathology is, to a very great extent, pathology of neurons, glia and the vascular system as these determine the degree of neuronal death as well as the outcome and scale of the neurological deficit. This review article is focused on the intricate interrelations among neurons, glia, the vascular system, neuronal cells, and the DNA damage response.

     "abstract": "Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate central nervous system and plays an important role in synaptic plasticity required for learning and memory. Activation of glutamate ionotropic receptors promptly triggers membrane depolarization and Ca2+ influx, resulting in the activation of several different protein kinases and transcription factors. For example, glutamate-mediated Ca2+ influx activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase, protein kinase C, and mitogen activated protein kinases resulting in activation of transcription factors such as cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB). Abnormally prolonged exposure to glutamate causes neuronal injury, and such \u201cexcitotoxicity\u201d has been implicated in many acute and chronic diseases including ischemic stroke, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and Parkinson's diseases. Interestingly, although glutamate-induced Ca2+ influx can cause DNA damage by a mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-mediated mechanism, the Ca2+ simultaneously activates CREB, resulting in up-regulation of the DNA repair and redox protein apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1. Here, we review connections between physiological or aberrant glutamate receptor activation, Ca2+-mediated signaling, oxidative DNA damage and repair efficiency, and neuronal vulnerability. We conclude that glutamate signaling involves an adaptive cellular stress response pathway that enhances DNA repair capability, thereby protecting neurons against injury and disease.",

Mitochondrial transfection of isolated organelles and in whole cells with customized DNA synthesized to contain defined lesions has wide prospects for deciphering repair mechanisms in a physiological context. We document here the strategies currently developed to transfer DNA of interest into mitochondria. Methodologies with isolated mitochondria claim to exploit the protein import pathway or the natural competence of the organelles, to permeate the membranes or to use conjugal transfer from bacteria. Besides biolistics, which remains restricted to yeast and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, nanocarriers or fusion proteins have been explored as methods to target custom DNA into mitochondria in intact cells. In further approaches, whole mitochondria have been transferred into recipient cells. Repair failure or error-prone repair leads to mutations which potentially could be rescued by allotopic expression of proteins. The relevance of the different approaches for the analysis of mitochondrial DNA repair mechanisms and of aging is discussed.",

Nerve conduction studies revealed normal nerve function in young adult (8 week) Ercc1\u2212/\u0394 mice, but significant abnormalities in 20 week-old animals. Morphologic and ultrastructural analysis of the sciatic nerve from mutant mice revealed significant alterations at 20 but not 8 weeks of age.

To determine if increased DNA oxidation is associated with altered repair capacity, levels of OGG1 protein in HPG were measured by immunohistochemistry and levels of OGG1 mRNA were measured in SMTG using quantitative PCR. Results show significantly increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) 8-OHG immunostaining in DNA and RNA of PCAD HPG and significantly increased 8-OHG in PCAD SMTG. Quantification of OGG1 showed significantly elevated mRNA in PCAD SMTG and a trend toward elevated protein immunostaining in PCAD HPG.

We hypothesized that an age-associated increase in activity of phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway may be playing a causal role in the age-associated cytokine dysregulation. We found that gene expression of both the regulatory (p85\u03b2) and the catalytic (p110\u03b4) subunits of Class IA PI3K is higher in aged than in young splenic macrophages. The age-associated increase in the activity of PI3K was also demonstrated by an upregulation of P-Akt and its downstream target, glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Inhibition of PI3K enhanced induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, by TLR-2/TLR-1, TLR-2/TLR-6 and TLR-4 ligands as well as heat killed S. pneumoniae (HKSP). Therefore, targeting PI3-Kinase could rescue cytokine dysregulation in aged macrophages and enhance the relevant pro-inflammatory cytokines needed to support B-cell activation and differentiation.",

     "abstract": "This study examined age-related changes in renal dopaminergic activity and expression of amino acid transporters potentially involved in renal tubular uptake of l-DOPA in Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats. Aging (from 13 to 91 weeks) was accompanied by increases in systolic blood pressure (SBP) in both WKY and SHR. The sum of urinary dopamine and DOPAC and the urinary dopamine/l-DOPA ratio were increased in aged SHR but not in aged WKY. The urinary dopamine/renal delivery of l-DOPA ratio was increased in both rat strains with aging. LAT2 abundance was increased in aged WKY and SHR. The expression of 4F2hc was markedly elevated in aged SHR but not in aged WKY. ASCT2 was upregulated in both aged WKY and SHR. Plasma aldosterone levels and urinary noradrenaline levels were increased in aged WKY and SHR though levels of both entities were more elevated in aged SHR. Activation of the renal dopaminergic system is more pronounced in aged SHR than in aged WKY and is associated with an upregulation of renal cortical ASCT2 in WKY and of LAT2/4F2hc and ASCT2 in SHR. This activation may be the consequence of a counter-regulatory mechanism for stimuli leading to sodium reabsorption.",

     "abstract": "The age-related increased impedance in large arteries overloads the senescent heart, and the myocardial phenotype is hypertrophic. Together with qualitative changes observed in the senile heart, this can be responsible for impaired diastolic function. A restricted diet providing adequate nutrient intake, e.g. alternate-day fasting (ADF), has been shown to extend life-span and decrease incidence and progression of age-associated diseases in laboratory rodents, and to ameliorate some metabolic markers of aging in rhesus monkeys and humans.This study reports an age-related increase of some biological and morphological hypertrophy markers in the rat heart, together with increased plasma BNP, a well known marker of heart failure. The tissue modifications might likely be related to hyper-activation of two of the signaling pathways associated with myocardial pathological hypertrophy: ERK1/2 and PI3K\u03b3. Increased ERK1/2 activation might be in part related to the disturbance of STAT3, with a consequent decrease of SOCS3.In this context, the down-modulation of ERK1/2 and PI3K\u03b3 signaling, together with the restoration of STAT3 activity and SOCS3 content, both observed with ADF, might help to reduce pathological hypertrophy stimuli and to rescue an important cardioprotective pathway, possibly opening new preventive and therapeutic perspectives in age-related heart failure.",

Importantly, viability is determined on the basis of the cell's ability to divide and form a colony, probably not the ideal parameter when studying post-mitotic cellular ageing. This study describes the optimization and validation of a method based on the flow cytometric monitoring of propidium iodide (PI) uptake for assessing yeast cell death during CLS. The optimized protocol is quick, reliable, reproducible and can accommodate high-throughput studies. The method was validated by determining CLS of several strains used in yeast ageing research and by evaluating the effect of genetic disturbances known to extend or reduce yeast chronological life span.",

Only one association, namely that of SNP rs4420638 near the APOC1 gene, achieved genome-wide significance (allele-based P\u00a0=\u00a01.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u221210). However, logistic regression analysis revealed that this association, which was replicated in an independent German sample, is fully explicable by linkage disequilibrium with the APOE allele \u025b4, the only variant hitherto established as a major genetic determinant of survival into old age. Our GWAS failed to identify any additional autosomal susceptibility genes. One explanation for this lack of success in our study would be that GWAS provide only limited statistical power for a polygenic phenotype with loci of small effect such as human longevity. A recent GWAS in Dutch LLI independently confirmed the APOE\u2013longevity association, thus strengthening the conclusion that this locus is a very, if not the most, important genetic factor influencing longevity.",

In clk-1, complexes I\u2013III activity is inhibited while complexes II\u2013III activity is normal. We asked whether the complexes I\u2013III defect in clk-1 was caused by: (1) a defect in the ETC; (2) an inhibitory effect of DMQ9; or (3) a decreased amount of ubiquinone.We extracted the endogenous quinones from wildtype (N2) and clk-1 mitochondria, replenished them with exogenous ubiquinones, and measured ETC activities.Replenishment of extracted mutant and wildtype mitochondria resulted in equal enzymatic activities for complexes I\u2013III and II\u2013III ETC assays. Blue native gels showed that supercomplex formation was indistinguishable between clk-1 and N2. The addition of a pentane extract from clk-1 mitochondria containing DMQ9 to wildtype mitochondria specifically inhibited complexes I\u2013III activity. UQ in clk-1 mitochondria was oxidized compared to N2.Our results show that no measurable intrinsic ETC defect exists in clk-1 mitochondria.

At the cellular level, aging of human mammary epithelial cells is associated with significant morphological and functional alterations such as an increased cell size and a reduced proliferation. Cellular senescence of HMEC cannot be explained by a single mechanism but represents an interaction of numerous extra- and intracellular events and the complexity of such orchestrating pathways is still hardly understood. Besides the contribution of reactive oxygen species and telomere dysfunction to aging, it is the aim of this mini-review, to compare distinct changes to extracellular signals by certain matrix metalloproteinases including MMP-7 and associated growth factor pathways mediated by HB\u2013EGF activation in young and aging HMEC. Such changes can alter hormone receptor levels within aged HMEC, induce tissue fibrosis and promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition as a potential prerequisite for breast cancer development. Moreover, an accumulation of aging cells during the normal life span of the breast tissue may also substantially effect and interact with adjacent neighboring populations in the local microenvironment to provide optimized growth conditions which would also support neoplastic cells.",

Rats were acclimated to COOL or TMN for 2 months, instrumented for cardiovascular telemetry and studied in calorimeters.

Groups of rats were studied after 10 weeks CR, one year CR, and after 4 days of re-feeding. Both 10 weeks and one year of CR reduced HR and VO2 irrespective of Ta. Evaluation of the relationship between metabolic organ mass (liver, heart, brain, and kidney mass) and energy expenditure revealed a clear shift induced by CR to reduce expenditure per unit metabolic mass in both COOL and TMN groups. Re-feeding resulted in prompt elevations of HR and VO2 to levels observed in control rats. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that long term CR produces sustained reductions in metabolic rate and heart rate in rats.",

In the present study diperoxovanadate (DPV) was used as it is known to be stable at physiological pH, to be catalase-resistant and to substitute for H2O2 in its activities at concentrations order of magnitudes lower. On treating NIH3T3 cells with DPV, SIPS-like morphology was observed along with an immediate response of rounding of the cells by disruption of actin cytoskeleton and transient G2/M arrest. DPV could bring about growth arrest and senescence associated features at 25\u00a0\u03bcM dose, which were not seen with similar doses of either H2O2 or vanadate. A minimal dose of 150\u00a0\u03bcM of H2O2 was required to induce similar affects as 25\u00a0\u03bcM DPV. Increase in senescent associated markers such as p21, HMGA2 and PAI-1 was more prominent in DPV treated cells compared to similar dose of H2O2. DPV-treated cells showed marked relocalization of Cyclin D1 from nucleus to cytoplasm. These results indicate that DPV, stable inorganic peroxide, is more efficient in inducing SIPS at lower concentrations compared to H2O2.",

Electrophysiological results in CA1 hippocampal slices showed that basal synaptic transmission was not affected by EE in adult mice whereas it was partially improved in aged animals, even though not sufficient to rescue the decrease related to aging. Besides, no effect of EE on N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and theta-burst-induced long-term potentiation was found in adult or aged animals.These results indicate that continuous EE is able to improve cognitive abilities in adult NMRI female mice, that does not correlate with changes in theta burst-related synaptic plasticity within neuronal networks.

It is also demonstrated that connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a Wnt-4 target gene and is potentially involved in a negative feed-back loop of Wnt signal regulation.

The level of positive TUNEL cells (both apoptotic and with DNA fragmentation), oxidative DNA damage (8-oxoG immunostaining), sister chromatid exchange and bleomycin-induced chromatid breaks were significantly increased in the combined old group compared to the combined adult group. We observed a negative correlation between micronuclei formation and age, which may be associated with damaged cells undergoing apoptosis, rather than expressing micronuclei. We were unable to show any significant changes in the nuclear division index value, which reflects the proliferative status of the viable cell fraction during aging.

But it is evident that the information that can be gleaned from a direct analysis in specific tissues is largely greater. Nevertheless, the accurate measurement of disulfides is frequently hampered by the artifactual oxidation occurring during sample manipulation as a consequence of the presence of heme-proteins. Therefore, the levels of disulfide forms of low molecular mass thiols in tissues are still poorly investigated, even if their measurements could represent a powerful index of the oxidative status. Here we have used an artifact-free procedure to measure low molecular mass thiols and their disulfides in different rat tissues. Our findings suggest that disulfides are a reliable biomarker of even slight oxidative damage.

We examined the relation of father's age at the birth of the offspring (FAB) with LTL in the offspring in 2177 participants of the Family Heart Study and the probability of developing breast cancer in 1405 women from the Framingham Heart Study (offspring cohort). For each year of increase in FAB (adjusted for mother's age at birth), LTLs in the daughters and sons were longer by 19.4\u00a0bp and 12.2\u00a0bp, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

We conclude that older fathers endow their offspring with a longer LTL and their daughters with increased susceptibility to breast cancer. These independent observations cannot provide evidence for a causal relationship, mediated by telomere length, between FAB and increased breast cancer risk in daughters. However, with couples delaying having children in today's society, studies exploring the LTL association with increased breast cancer risk in daughters of older fathers might be timely and relevant.",

In this study, phenotypic characteristics and function of Treg cells were analyzed in young (4\u20136\u00a0months) and aged (18\u201322\u00a0months) mice prior to and during the course of primary influenza infection. Upon infection, aged, but not young, mice have a significant expansion of Treg cells. In addition, Treg cells of aged mice demonstrate both a higher percentage and higher expression per cell of CD69 both at baseline and during infection compared to young mice. However, Treg cells isolated from young and aged mice comparably suppress CD8 T cells and suppression is dose dependent. These results suggest that the increase in the percentage of Treg cells in aged mice may contribute to the diminished CD8 T cell response to primary influenza infection.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrially encoded proteins in long-lived animals exhibit a characteristic anomaly on the amino acid usage level: they abstain from the use of cysteine in a lifespan-dependent fashion. Here, we have further investigated this phenomenon by analyzing respiratory chain complex subunits individually. We find that complex I cysteine depletion is the almost exclusive carrier of the cysteine-lifespan correlation, whereas complex IV cysteine depletion is uniform in all aerobic animals, unrelated to longevity, but even more pronounced than complex I cysteine depletion in the longest-lived species. In nuclear encoded subunits of the respiratory chain, we find lifespan-independent cysteine depletion ranging from moderate in complex I to severe in complex V. However, a separate analysis of the transmembrane domains of these proteins unmasks an intramembrane pattern of cysteine usage that significantly correlates with longevity. Hence, cysteine usage in the respiratory chain seems to be governed by two independent molecular mechanisms acting on the protein level: a global trend of cysteine avoidance in all proteins, and a specific effect on transmembrane domain cysteines that reflects longevity. To account for these characteristic patterns, a thiyl radical-based molecular mechanism of intramembrane hydrophobic cross-linking is discussed.",

     "abstract": "Lsh, a protein related to the SNF2 family of chromatin-remodeling ATPases, is a major epigenetic regulator that is essential for DNA methylation and histone acetylation at repetitive elements. Lsh represses endogenous p16INK4a expression by recruiting HDAC to the p16INK4a promoter, which in turn delays cell senescence. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern loss of Lsh expression during cellular senescence have yet to be elucidated. Here we investigate the transcriptional regulation of the human Lsh promoter. We find that the minimal Lsh promoter is located between positions \u2212216 and \u2212119 relative to the transcription start site, and contains two putative E2F binding sites. Ectopic E2F1 increases expression of Lsh at both transcriptional and translational levels. E2F1 physically interacts with the Lsh promoter by binding to each of the two putative binding sites and transactivates the Lsh promoter. E2F1 also induces Lsh protein expression and transactivates the Lsh promoter in 2BS cells. At the same time, E2F1-induced Lsh promoter activity is reduced in senescent cells compared to young cells. These results indicate that E2F1 plays a crucial role in transcriptional control of the human Lsh gene and the decrease of Lsh expression in senescent cells is related to the repression of E2F1.",

Dendritic cells (DCs) are major activators of T cells, providing signals that drive their expansion and differentiation. In this study, we asked if decreased CD4+ T cell responses were influenced by the age of DCs rather than being exclusively due to T cell defects. Old T cells transferred to young recipients expanded and differentiated similarly to young T cells. However, aged recipients were poor stimulators of both old and young T cells, which failed to acquire CD44 expression and produce interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3). DCs in aged hosts expressed fewer MHC\u2013peptide complexes. The CD86 expression in the DCs of both hosts was similar; however, CD40 levels were reduced in old DCs. Finally, old DCs failed to produce inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS. Our results indicate that the impairment of aged CD4+ T cell function is intimately related to multiple alterations in aged DCs, rather than being caused solely by intrinsic T cell defects, suggesting that the function of aged T cells may be partially rescued in vivo when appropriate stimulation is applied. These findings are relevant to vaccination design for elderly populations.",

Our study shows that the DIs robustly characterize accelerated rates of aging irrespective of specific of deficits. When a wider spectrum of health dimensions is considered these rates are better approximated by quadratic law. Exponential rates are more characteristic for more severe health dimensions. The aging rates are the same for males and females. Individuals who contracted major diseases and those who were free of them exhibited the same aging rates as characterized by the DI constructed using mild deficits.

A 26% CR regime induced at 14 months of age for 70 days in male C57Bl/6 (ICRFa) mice resulted in a reduction in body mass of 17%. A decrease in daily energy expenditure was associated with decreased body mass in CR mice. There was no difference in total levels of physical activity between the CR and ad libitum (AL) groups; however, activity patterns were different. We developed a Bayesian model to dissect the impact of food anticipation activity (FAA) and feeding on physical activity. FAA was stronger in CR mice and remaining basal activity was higher in AL mice, but CR mice displayed larger diurnal variations as well as a phase shift in their diurnal activity. CR mice displayed lower body temperature, especially late during the dark phase. This was due to lower basal (activity-independent) temperature at all times of the day, coupled to a phase shift in the diurnal rhythm. The correlation between body temperature and physical activity was independent of feeding regimen and light/dark cycles. Reduction of body mass and basal temperature were major compensatory mechanisms to reduced food availability during late-onset, short-term CR.",

On HB101 food, the eat-2, eat-5 and dbl-1 mutants show increased lifespan compared to that of the wild type. This result is probably due to nutrient limitation because the eat mutations reduce food uptake and the mutation of dbl-1 that regulates expression of several digestive enzymes leads to nutrient limitation. In contrast, the lifespans of the eat-2 and dbl-1 mutants decreased from that of the wild type on OP50 food. We found that live OP50 cells within a worm were markedly more in these mutants than in the wild type, which suggests that impaired digestion of pathogenic OP50 decreased lifespan in the eat-2 and dbl-1 mutants.",

     "abstract": "Age-dependent loss of oxidative defense is well recognized in rodent models, although the control mechanism is still obscure; a few studies have shown how microRNAs, a non-coding RNA species, regulate the expression of their target genes at the post-transcriptional level. In the current study, miR-34a and miR-93 are observed to increase in middle- and old-age rat liver, compared to young rats; the up-regulation of these two miRNAs is determined by qPCR through a grind-and-find approach, and histochemical in situ hybridization. Three commonly used miRNA target prediction programs suggest four candidate targets of miR-34a and miR-93: Sp1, Nrf2 (Nfe2l2), Sirt1 and Mgst1; their expression is found to be reduced inversely to the up-regulation of the two miRNAs by Western blotting of protein extracts, as well as immunofluorescence staining of intact liver tissues. Furthermore, the suppression of the four proteins by miR-34a/miR-93 is examined in HEK 293 cells by transfection and co-transfection; miR-34a represses all four proteins\u2019 expression, whereas miR-93 affects only Sp1, Sirt1 and Mgst1. Taken together, our study suggests a model of post-transcriptional repression, not only of genes involved in oxidative stress regulation and oxidative stress defense proteins, such as Sirt1 and Mgst1, but also of upstream transcription factors (TFs) regulating their activation, since Sp1 is the TF for both Sirt1 and Mgst1, and Nrf2 is the TF of Mgst1. Thus, up-regulation of both miR-34a and miR-93 constitutes an inescapable repression of two vital oxidative defense genes, by targeting not only the targets, but also transcription factors controlling their activation, a double dampening regulation at the post-transcriptional level.",

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TLR4 gene, such as +896A/G, known to attenuate receptor signaling, have been described. The +896A/G SNP is significantly less frequent in patients with myocardial infarction, Alzheimer's disease or prostate cancer, whereas it is overrepresented in centenarians. To clarify and confirm the biological effects of +896A/G SNP and its role in the pathophysiology of age-related diseases and longevity, we assessed the levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10 and eicosanoids (LTB4 and PGE2) in LPS-stimulated whole blood samples in vitro of 50 young healthy Sicilians, screened for the presence of this SNP. To evaluate the possible influence of SNPs in PTGS2 and 5-Lo genes on eicosanoid production, the enrolled individuals were also genotyped for \u2212765G/C PTGS2 and \u22121708G/A 5-Lo SNPs. Both pro-inflammatory cytokines and eicosanoids were significantly lower in carriers bearing the TLR4 mutation, whereas the anti-inflammatory IL-10 values were higher. On the basis of data reported herein, some suggestions can be drawn. First, pathogen load, by interacting with the host genotype, determines the type and intensity of inflammatory responses, according to the pro-inflammatory status and tissue injury, implicated in the pathophysiology of major age-related diseases. Second, adequate control of inflammatory response might reduce the risk of these diseases, and, reciprocally, might increase the chance of extended survival in an environment with reduced antigen (that is, pathogen) load.",

LP pups in the first generation were smaller at birth, but catch-up growth; F2-LP offspring had higher body mass at birth, but there was no difference in the F3 generation. The pancreatic mass decreased in F1-LP through F3-LP at birth but increased in F2-LP at weaning. The islet volume density and diameter were smaller in all restricted groups at day 1 and 21, and F1-LP had the lowest islet number; at birth, beta cell mass was smaller in F1-LP through F3-LP and remained low throughout suckling. At day 1 and 21, pups were normoglycemic, but were hypoinsulinemic at weaning.

The fraction of this type of mutation among the different types of mutations detected was not affected by calorie restriction. The percentage of the other types of mutation was not influenced either.

Both groups were exposed to extreme physical activity, as well. Among the divers following the oxidative stress, significant telomere elongation was observed in granulocytes and na\u00efve T cells, but not in memory T cells and B cells. Telomere length in granulocytes was mildly elongated in the control group as well, a finding that may relate to the extreme physical activity to which they were exposed. While telomere elongation in na\u00efve T cells may be attributed to telomerase activation, we suggest that in granulocytes the elongation results from undifferentiated hematopoietic cells carrying longer telomeres that repopulate the peripheral hematopoietic compartment. This event might be accompanied by enhanced cell division within the repopulating pool. Since the aging of mammalian tissues can be attributed in part to the reduction in the replicative potential of self renewing cells, enhanced cell turnover under conditions of hyperbaric oxidative stress might be directly relevant to tissue and organismal aging.",

When analysis included all regions, aging was associated with expression of genes linked to mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, and stress responses, and in some cases, expression was reversed by CR.

CR decreased cytosolic ubiquitin and upregulated deubiquitinating genes. Region specific analyses indicated that CA1 was more susceptible to aging stress, exhibiting a greater number of altered genes relative to CA3 and the dentate gyrus (DG), and an enrichment of genes related to the immune response and apoptosis. CA3 and the DG were more responsive to CR, exhibiting marked changes in the total number of genes across diet conditions, reversal of age-related changes in p53 signaling, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, and enrichment of genes related to cell survival and neurotrophic signaling.

For all the quantification methods, the concentration of cf-DNA was significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in nonagenarians as compared to controls. The quality of the cf-DNA also displayed a marked difference between nonagenarians and controls; a fragmented pattern or appearance of low molecular weight cf-DNA was observed in the majority of the nonagenarians, whereas in controls, cf-DNA was intact and had a quasi-genomic, high molecular weight appearance. In nonagenarians, the quality of cf-DNA appeared similar in the original and follow-up samples. We propose that some, as yet uncharacterized, aspects of aging are reflected in the appearance of cf-DNA.",

     "abstract": "After extended proliferation, cells enter a state of replicative quiescence that is probably due to progressive telomere shortening. It is supposed that changes in telomere structure eventually expose the chromosome ends to undesired recombination events and thus promote cell senescence. The telomeric 3\u2032-overhang is crucial for efficient chromosome capping, but its specific role in telomere shortening and in triggering the senescence program is uncertain. We have addressed this issue by measuring the 3\u2032-overhangs of a human tissue cells aging in vivo. The 3\u2032-overhangs were analyzed in blood samples from 41 individuals aged 91\u2013106 years and 89 individuals ranging from 6 months to 85 years. We found that the overall 3\u2032-overhang length did not significantly change with age, but did, however, find extensively eroded 3\u2032-overhangs in 3 subjects of the 91\u2013106 years cohort and one 61 years old subject affected with Down syndrome. These subjects had 3\u2032-overhang length distributions skewed towards shorter tails, the shortest overall telomere lengths and the highest frequencies of very short telomeres. These data raise the possibility that during ageing very short telomeres with very poor 3\u2032-overhangs can reach a critical point for functional telomeres.",

They catalyze the NAD+-dependent modification of proteins with poly(ADP-ribose). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation plays a key role in a plethora of processes including DNA repair, tumor progression and aging. Here we report that PaPARP, the single protein with a PARP catalytic domain, in the fungal aging model Podospora anserina, indeed displays a NAD+-dependent poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity. While unable to select a PaParp deletion strain, we succeeded in the generation of PaParp overexpressors. Biochemically these strains are characterized by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and a lowered ATP content. They show an increased sensitivity against different stressors including the DNA damaging agent phleomycin, the reactive oxygen generator paraquat, and the apoptosis inducer farnesol. PaParp overexpressors are impaired in growth, in pigmentation and fertility, and have a shortened lifespan. Our results demonstrate the relevance of poly(ADP-ribose) metabolism for aging and development in P. anserina. With a single PARP this metabolism is less complex than in higher eukaryotes and thus P. anserina appears to be a promising system to connect basic PARP functions with the well established network of pathways relevant for organismal aging.",

     "abstract": "Restricted feeding regimes in rodents that extend longevity lower the rate of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species generation. This effect is not dependent upon the depression of the state III and IV mitochondrial respiration rates. Mitochondria from liver, skeletal muscle and brown adipose tissue adapt to DR feeding with a lowered membrane potential that results from an enhanced proton leak across the inner membrane. Mitochondrial ROS generation is very sensitive to the magnitude of the membrane potential and the enhanced proton leak and ROS generation rates are reversible by exogenous insulin in liver and heart mitochondria. The adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) was shown to be the dominant proton leak channel induced under DR feeding regimes in these tissues, while in brown fat mitochondria, UCP1 was activated, but this was not sensitive to exogenous insulin treatment. The effect of DR to modify the proton leak, membrane potential and ROS generation rate can be simulated by a range of non-esterified free fatty acids (NEFA) acting on the ANT to enhance its protonophoric activity. Mobilisation of NEFA under DR feeding, when insulin plasma concentrations are extremely low, explains the indirect action of insulin to counteract the effects of DR feeding on mitochondrial ROS generation.",

We studied whether the level of this protein was affected in the HHS in old animals. The effects of aging are compared to those of an oxidant compound (cumene hydroperoxide) administered to young rats. The results indicate that oxidative stress could be involved in the alterations of eEF-2, which forms adducts with malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE). The alterations of eEF-2 levels, secondary to lipid peroxidation and adduct formation with these aldehydes could contribute to the suboptimal hormone production from these tissues during aging.

While the deleterious effects of age-dependent methylation changes after adulthood have attracted the attention of researchers, the relationship between those changes and changes that occur before adulthood have not been focused on. In this study, dozens of CpG sites whose methylation status changed after adulthood were identified in the mouse muscle, brain, and liver, by analysis of the methylation status of 316 CpG sites located within \u22127 to 3\u00a0kb of the transcription start sites (TSS-flanking regions) of 350 genes. Although the majority of the methylation changes were tissue-specific, two characteristics were observed in the methylation changes of each tissue. First, most DNA methylation changes after adulthood were preceded by prominent and same-direction DNA methylation changes before adulthood, and second, the expression levels of genes near progressively methylated and demethylated CpG sites were already significantly low and high, respectively, in young mice. The latter finding was also confirmed by analyzing recently published data of genome-wide age-dependent methylation changes. These results suggest that the DNA methylation status consistently move toward development/maturation throughout lifespan, and the tissue-dependent epigenetic or transcriptional status underlies the methylation changes.",

Moreover, these animals exhibit a smaller body size, a trait also observed in several other long-lived mouse models. One hypothesis is that alterations in the expression of paternally methylated imprinted genes are responsible for the life-extension of bi-maternal mice. Considering the similarities in postnatal growth retardation between mice with mutations in the Rasgrf1 imprinted gene and bi-maternal mice, Rasgrf1 is the most likely culprit for the low body weight and extended lifespan of bi-maternal mice. Rasgrf1 is a neuronal guanine-nucleotide exchange factor that induces Ras signaling in a calcium-dependent manner and has been implicated in learning and memory. Like other long-lived mouse strains, Rasgrf1 mutants are known to have low growth hormone and IGF-1 levels and the Rasgrf1 yeast homolog CDC25 had been previously associated with lifespan. Therefore, although the evidence is not conclusive, it does point towards the involvement of Rasgrf1 in the regulation of longevity, hypothetically through a mechanism similar to that observed in other long-lived mice of low GH/IGF-1 signaling causing a low body weight and life-extension.",

Many studies proved that oxidation is the key reason of nuclear cataract. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are formed in mitochondria as a by-product of normal metabolism and as a consequence of exposure to environmental compounds. Therefore, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is at particularly high risk of ROS-induced damage. Oxidative damage to mtDNA has been implicated as a causative factor in a wide variety of degenerative diseases and aging. However, the effect of mtDNA damage to the lens has not been studied. The goals of the study were to identify if there was increased mtDNA damage in lens when the eye were exposed to hyperoxic or hypoxic conditions and also to evaluate the changes in gene expression of mtDNA base excision repair (mtBER) enzymes. Our data have shown that the damage of mtDNA, the expression of mtBER enzymes and the level of 8-OHdG in lens increased after inspired hyperoxia, which is likely associated with oxidative stress. However, there was no effect to mtDNA and mtBER enzymes in lens after inspired hypoxia.

In the present study we have compared patch-clamp potassium (K+) current recordings from dermal fibroblasts (DF) obtained from young, elderly and centenarian donors. We found that in DF from elderly donors, but not from centenarians, K+ current amplitude is significantly smaller with respect to DF from young donors. Moreover, cell membrane capacitance of DF from elderly donors is smaller with respect to young donors and centenarians. We also observed that the voltage-gated Shaker Kv1.1 channel is expressed in higher percentage of elderly's and centenarian's DF than young's, whereas the large-conductance calcium-activated K+ (BKCa) channel \u03b21 subunit is expressed in lower percentage of centenarian's DF than in elderly's and young's. The maintenance of \u201cyoung\u201d K+ currents and the peculiar age-related remodeling of K+ channel subtypes in centenarian's DF is likely associated with successful aging and might provide a predictive marker of longevity.",

This study investigated the effects of AGEs-bovine serum albumin (AGEs) in human T cells. Incubation of Jurkat and several immortalized T cell lines with AGEs resulted in cell death dose-dependently. AGEs-induced cell death was partially but significantly blocked by neutralizing antibodies recognizing receptor of AGEs. In addition to detecting DNA nick, simultaneous stainings of annexin V with 7-amino-actinomycin D further confirmed the apoptotic nature of cell death. AGEs also caused apoptosis in purified T cells. Although AGEs-induced apoptosis could be blocked by the pan-caspase inhibitor, Ala-Asp-fluomethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk), there was no activation of caspase-3, -5, -8 and -9. AGEs caused mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization and this process was prevented by an antioxidant or Z-VAD-fmk. Furthermore, AGEs treatment led to translocation of apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) from the mitochondria into the nucleus. Altogether, this report demonstrated that AGEs induced T cell apoptosis in an oxidative stress-associated and caspase-dependent manner with involvement of the mitochondrial pathway. It is likely that AGEs-induced T cell apoptosis may play a role in T cell homeostasis in ageing.",

In this paper, we systematically analyzed properties of longevity genes in Caenorhabditis elegans and found that, when compared to genes not yet known to be involved in longevity, known longevity genes display the following features: (i) longer genomic sequences and protein sequences, (ii) a stronger tendency to co-express with other genes during a transition from dauer state (an extremely long lifespan) to non-dauer state (a normal lifespan), (iii) significant enrichment in certain functions and RNAi phenotypes, (iv) higher sequence conservation, and (v) higher in several network topological features such as degrees in a functional interaction network. Based on these features, we developed an algorithm to predict longevity genes in C. elegans and obtained 243 novel longevity genes with a precision rate of 0.85.

Mutations in ttx-3 and ceh-10 were associated closely with lower pumping rates at adult day 8 and caused a more rapid accumulated intestinal autofluorescence than wild-type N2. Mutations in ceh-10 remarkably affected fertility and egg number in the uterus. The regulation of ttx-3 and ceh-10 on longevity was not temperature-dependent, and ttx-3, and ceh-10 mutants all formed very few dauers at 27\u00a0\u00b0C. The shortened lifespan of the ttx-3 or ceh-10 mutants was completely or largely rescued by expression of TTX-3 or CEH-10 in AIY interneurons. Moreover, the long-lived phenotype of the daf-2 mutant could be suppressed by both the ttx-3 and the ceh-10 mutations. Furthermore, ablation of AIY interneurons shortened the longevity of wild-type and the daf-2 mutant. Therefore, ttx-3 and ceh-10 regulate the longevity through influencing the insulin/IGF signaling pathway in C. elegans.",

To establish whether they play a role in the age-specific thymic decline, the miRNA expression pattern was examined in TN subsets of young and aged mice. Fifty-two percent of the miRNAs exhibited elevated expression levels in the aged TN1 cells.

It is known that when the concentration of intermediates in Krebs cycle is increased, NAD+/NADH ratio will be decreased. NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase sirtuin1 (SIRT1) prolongs mammalian cellular lifespan. Therefore, we propose that NaDC3 accelerates cellular aging by inhibiting SIRT1. After NaDC3 was overexpressed in two human embryo lung fibroblastic cell lines, WI38 and MRC-5, we found that the cells displayed aging-related phenotypes in advance. Meanwhile, the level of SIRT1 activity was down-regulated. In WI38/hNaDC3 cells treated with the activators of SIRT1, aging-related phenotypes induced by NaDC3 were obviously improved. The NAD+/NADH ratio in WI38/hNaDC3 cells was also decreased. Further study found that enhanced intracellular NAD+ level could attenuate the aging phenotypes induced by NaDC3.

Results demonstrate that fibroblasts from aged donors, already at early CPD, exhibit an impaired redox balance, highlighting the importance of this parameter during ageing, even in the presence of standard environmental conditions, which are considered optimal for cell growth. By contrast, several proteins, as those related to heat shock response, or involved in endoplasmic reticulum and membrane trafficking, appeared differentially expressed only during in vitro ageing, suggesting that, at high CPD, the whole cell machinery becomes permanently altered.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs189037) in the promoter region of ATM gene was identified, and significant association between CT genotype and longevity was observed.

This robust proliferation is then suppressed as the animal approaches adult size, bringing many tissues to a quiescent state where proliferation occurs only as needed to replace dying cells. Recent evidence suggests that the mechanism responsible for this decline in proliferation involves a multi-organ genetic program. We hypothesized that this genetic program continues to progress into later adult life, eventually suppressing proliferation to levels below those needed for tissue renewal, thus contributing to aging. We therefore used expression microarray to compare the temporal changes in gene expression that occur in adult mouse organs during aging to those occurring as juvenile proliferation slows. We found that many of the changes in gene expression that occur during the aging process originate during the period of juvenile growth deceleration. Bioinformatic analyses of the genes that show persistent decline in expression throughout postnatal life indicated that cell-cycle-related genes are strongly over-represented. Thus, the findings support the hypothesis that the genetic program that slows juvenile growth to limit body size persists into adulthood and thus may eventually hamper tissue maintenance and repair, contributing to the aging process.",

We report that reduced complexes I, III, and IV activity extend lifespan but that complex II disruption does not. However, disruption to all four complexes affected metabolism in a similar manner suggesting that metabolic effects induced by ETC disruption are separable from lifespan extension.

This includes induction of genes for mitochondrial fatty-acid \u03b2-oxidation (acs-2), the glyoxylate cycle (gei-7), gluconeogensis (PEPCK), and glycolysis (gpd-3).

In these experiments, loss of WRN resulted in a significant decrease in nonhomologous integration events and ablation of recombinants that required random integration of the corrected targeting vector. Aberrant recombinants were also recovered, but only from WRN-depleted cells.

Iron overload, especially in mitochondria, increases the availability of redox-active iron, which may be a causal factor in the extensive age-related biomolecular oxidative damage observed in aged organisms. Such damage is thought to play a major role in the pathogenesis of iron overload diseases and age-related pathologies. Indeed, recent findings of the beneficial effects of iron manipulation in life extension in Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and transgenic mice have sparked a renewed interest in the potential role of iron in longevity. A substantial research effort now focuses on developing and testing safe pharmacologic interventions to combat iron dyshomeostasis in aging, acute injuries and in iron overload disorders.",

A progressive loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and brain leads to muscle paralysis and death. As in other common neurodegenerative diseases, aging-related mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly being considered among the pathogenic factors. Mitochondria are critical for cell survival: they provide energy to the cell, buffer intracellular calcium, and regulate apoptotic cell death. Whether mitochondrial abnormalities are a trigger or a consequence of the neurodegenerative process and the mechanisms whereby mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to disease are not clear yet. Calcium homeostasis is a major function of mitochondria in neurons, and there is ample evidence that intracellular calcium is dysregulated in ALS. The impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on intracellular calcium homeostasis and its role in motor neuron demise are intriguing issues that warrants in depth discussion. Clearly, unraveling the causal relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium dysregulation, and neuronal death is critical for the understanding of ALS pathogenesis. In this review, we will outline the current knowledge of various aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction in ALS, with a special emphasis on the role of these abnormalities on intracellular calcium handling.",

Studies have employed a wide array of targeted molecules including antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, peroxiredoxin, superoxide dismutases and small molecular compounds which recapitulate the antioxidant activities of these enzymes. Lifespan and healthspan effects differ between interventions suggesting varied roles for specific mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and their impact on usual aging.

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are central players in the determination of cell life and death. They are essential for energy production, since most cellular ATP is produced in their matrix by the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. At the same time, mitochondria are the main regulators of apoptotic cell death, mediating both extrinsic (cell-surface receptor mediated) and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulate as side products of the electron transport chain, causing mitochondrial damage. Non-functional mitochondria accumulate in aged individuals, and cell homeostasis is maintained by removing damaged mitochondria by an autophagic process called \u201cmitophagy\u201d. In addition, mitochondrial ROS represent signaling molecules leading to autophagy, consisting in the bulk degradation of cytosolic portions. When cell homeostasis is perturbed, and cytosolic components are damaged, autophagy represents a defense mechanism aimed at removing non-functional proteins and organelles. If this is not sufficient, cell death occurs with distinct morphological hallmarks from apoptosis. This binary choice integrates a number of critical information converging on a number of common regulatory elements. In this review, the focus will be placed on the central role of mitochondria in the cross-talk between autophagy and apoptosis, highlighting the signaling pathways and molecular machinery impinging on these organelles.",

Among protein spots in which patterns of aging in expression in the limbic forebrain differed between SAMP10 and control, we identified three proteins by mass spectrometry: pyridoxal phosphate phosphatase (PLPP), collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2) and \u03b1-internexin. Expression of PLPP was increased in the limbic forebrain of 3-month-old SAMP10 mice.

Western blot revealed elevation in the level of phosphorylated CRMP-2 and the ratio of phosphorylation of \u03b1-internexin. Immunohistochemistry revealed that \u03b1-internexin was chiefly distributed in axons. Aging in SAMP10 mice was associated with abnormality of PLPP, CRMP-2 and \u03b1-internexin, all of which are known to be involved in brain cytoskeleton formation and associated with acute and chronic neurodegenerative conditions.

Due to its versatile role, PARP-1 is discussed both as a longevity factor and as an aging-promoting factor. Recently, we generated a mouse model with ectopic integration of full-length hPARP-1 [Mangerich, A., Scherthan, H., Diefenbach, J., Kloz, U., van der Hoeven, F., Beneke, S. and B\u00fcrkle, A., 2009.

Moreover, mutant male mice showed impaired glucose tolerance, yet without developing manifest diabetes. Overall tumor burden was comparable in wild-type and hPARP-1 mice, but tumor spectrum was shifted in mutant mice, showing lower incidence of sarcomas, but increased incidence of carcinomas. Furthermore, DNA repair was delayed in splenocytes of hPARP-1 mice, and gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was dysregulated.

Current vaccines are only partially protective in old age, which makes the elderly a critical target group for the development of new vaccine strategies. The recognition of pathogens via toll like receptors (TLR) and the subsequent generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines has generated interest in incorporating TLR agonists into new vaccines to enhance immunogenicity. However, TLR function is reportedly decreased in old age, leading to questions regarding the benefit of including TLR agonists into vaccines for the elderly. It is critical that we understand the function and role of TLRs in aged hosts prior to approving new TLR based adjuvants for vaccines that will be delivered to the elderly. In this study we determine the ability of TLRs on pulmonary macrophages from old mice to recognize and respond to infection with the virulent pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Although pulmonary (CD11c+) cells from old mice were fully capable of producing cytokines in response to M. tb infection, we demonstrate that in contrast to young mice, M. tb induced cytokine production occurred independently of TLR-2. Our data indicate that the inclusion of TLR-2 agonists into new vaccines may not be fully effective in the elderly population. Investigation into such age-related differences in TLR function is of critical importance for the design of effective vaccines that will protect the elderly against infectious diseases.",

WRN belongs to the RecQ DNA helicase family, members of which play a role in maintaining genomic stability. Here, we demonstrate that WRN rapidly forms discrete nuclear foci in an NBS1-dependent manner following DNA damage. NBS1 physically interacts with WRN through its FHA domain, which interaction is important for the phosphorylation of WRN. WRN subsequently forms DNA damage-dependent foci during the S phase, but not in the G1 phase. WS cells exhibit an increase in spontaneous focus formation of pol\u03b7 and Rad18, which are important for translesion synthesis (TLS). WRN also interacts with PCNA in the absence of DNA damage, but DNA damage induces the dissociation of PCNA from WRN, leading to the ubiquitination of PCNA, which is essential for TLS. This dissociation correlates with ATM/NBS1-dependent degradation of WRN. Moreover, WS cells show constitutive ubiquitination of PCNA and interaction between PCNA and Rad18 E3 ligase in the absence of DNA damage. Taken together, these results indicate that WRN participates in the TLS pathway to prevent genomic instability in an ATM/NBS1-dependent manner.",

In this study, we examined whether mRNA editing levels of two mRNA species, CYFIP2 and GABRA3, change with aging. CYFIP2 has been implicated in synaptic maintenance, while GABRA3 is a GABA receptor subunit, a part of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter system in the CNS. The levels of mRNA editing were assessed in cortex samples of 20 subjects 22\u2013102 years old. The data show an age-dependent statistically significant decrease in editing in CYFIP2. GABRA3 editing remained much more stable with age, implying that age-related decline of RNA editing is gene-specific. This is the first report of age-dependent decline in A-to-I editing.

The mechanisms by which advancing age predisposes to disease are now beginning to unfold, due in part, to genetic and environmental manipulations of longevity in lower organisms. Converging lines of evidence suggest that DNA damage may be a final common pathway linking several proposed mechanisms of aging. The present review forwards a theory for an additional aging pathway that involves modes of inherent genetic instability. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) are endogenous non-LTR retrotransposons that compose about 20% of the human genome. The LINE-1 (L1) gene products, ORF1p and ORF2p, possess mRNA binding, endonuclease, and reverse transcriptase activity that enable retrotransposition. While principally active only during embryogenesis, L1 transcripts are detected in adult somatic cells under certain conditions. The present hypothesis proposes that L1s act as an \u2018endogenous clock\u2019, slowly eroding genomic integrity by competing with the organism's double-strand break repair mechanism. Thus, while L1s are an accepted mechanism of genetic variation fueling evolution, it is proposed that longevity is negatively impacted by somatic L1 activity. The theory predicts testable hypotheses about the relationship between L1 activity, DNA repair, healthy aging, and longevity.",

     "abstract": "The transcription factor E47, which regulates immunoglobulin class switch in murine splenic B cells, is down-regulated in aged B cells due to reduced mRNA stability. Part of the decreased stability of E47 mRNA is mediated by tristetraprolin (TTP), a physiological regulator of mRNA stability. We have previously shown that TTP mRNA and protein expression are higher in old B cells, and the protein is less phosphorylated in old B cells, both of which lead to more binding of TTP to the 3\u2032-UTR of E47 mRNA, thereby decreasing its stability. PP2A is a protein phosphatase that plays an important role in the regulation of a number of major signaling pathways. Herein we show that not only the amount but also the activity of PP2A is increased in old B cells. As a consequence of this higher phosphatase activity in old B cells, p38 MAPK and TTP (either directly or indirectly by PP2A) are less phosphorylated as compared with young B cells. PP2A dephosphorylation of p38 MAPK and/or TTP likely generates more binding of the hypophosphorylated TTP to the E47 mRNA, inducing its degradation.

A survey of wild-type isolates from a local population of the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina for the presence of seven optional mitochondrial introns indicated that mitochondrial recombination does take place in nature. Moreover the recombination frequency appeared to be correlated with age: the more rapidly ageing fraction of the population had a significantly lower linkage disequilibrium indicating more recombination. Direct confrontation experiments with heterokaryon incompatible strains with different mitochondrial markers at different (relative) age confirmed that mitochondrial recombination increases with age.

Aging rats were subjected to swimming for two 1.5-h long bouts, separated by a 45\u00a0min rest period.

Our results show that the reduction in glucose disappearance rate (Kitt), observed in aged rats, was restored at 16\u00a0h after exercise. Aging led to an increase in Ser307 phosphorylation of IRS-1, and this was reversed by exercise in the skeletal muscle, in parallel with a reduction in pJNK and IkB\u03b1 degradation. Moreover, aging induced an increase in the expression of PTP-1B and attenuated insulin signaling in the muscle of rats, a phenomenon that was reversed by exercise.

Age-dependent SN-BER and LP-BER activity was increased in the mitochondria of liver, kidney and heart, but generally decreased in skeletal muscles. In contrast, no significant changes in repair activity were observed in nuclear extracts of the same tissues, except for quadriceps, where the SN-BER activity was higher in the old animals. Moreover, the BER activities in both the nucleus and the mitochondria were significantly lower in skeletal muscles compared to liver or kidney of the same mice. The protein level of three antioxidant enzymes, Mn and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (SOD) and catalase, was also significantly lower in skeletal muscle compared to liver or kidney. In addition, we found higher levels of protein carbonylation in the mitochondria of skeletal muscle relative to other tissues. Thus, it appears likely that mouse skeletal muscle is highly susceptible to oxidative stress due to deficiency in both repair of oxidative DNA damage and antioxidant enzymes, contributing to age-dependent muscle loss.",

The Gln27Gln genotype increases risks of cancer, MI and IC, whereas the Glu27 allele or, equivalently, the Gly16Glu27 haplotype tends to be protective against these diseases. Genetic associations with longevity are of opposite nature at young-old and oldest-old ages highlighting the phenomenon of antagonistic pleiotropy. The mechanism of antagonistic pleiotropy is associated with an evolutionary-driven advantage of carriers of a derived Gln27 allele at younger ages and their survival disadvantage at older ages as a result of increased risks of cancer, MI and IC. The ADRB2 gene can play an important systemic role in healthy aging in evolutionary context that warrants exploration in other populations.",

In keratinocytes, type II keratin 6 (K6) interacts with type I keratin 16 (K16). We previously showed that the intermediate filament protein K16 is up-regulated in aged human skin. Here, we report that there is an obvious imbalance of K16 to K6 mRNA in in vivo and in vitro aging, which possibly leads to cellular effects. To unveil a possible biological function of K16 overexpression we investigated the migration potential of keratinocytes having up-regulated K16 expression in vitro. Two cell lines were established by transfection of human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) with K16 or control vectors and subsequent fluorescence-activated cell sorting. By performing migration assays we were able to show a 90% reduction in the migration ability of the K16-overexpressing keratinocytes. In addition, a delay in wound closure associated with K16-overexpressing cells was shown by scratch assays. Transient overexpression of K6A in K16-overexpressing keratinocytes partially corrected the cell-migration defect. By real-time PCR we excluded co-regulation of the annotated interaction partner, K6, in the K16 cell line. Finally, we observed a decreased level of tyrosine phosphorylation in K16-overexpressing cells. Taken together, these data highlight the possibility of a physiological role for K6/K16 heterodimers in keratinocyte cell migration, in addition to the heterodimer's known functions in cell differentiation and mechanical resilience.",

Our aim was to investigate whether an antioxidant treatment combined with telomerase (hTERT) over-expression would prevent senescence of EC isolated from patients with severe atherosclerosis.Cells were isolated from internal mammary arteries (n\u00a0=\u00a011 donors), cultured until senescence with or without N-acetylcystein (NAC) and infected, or not, with a lentivirus over-expressing hTERT.Compared to control EC, hTERT-NAC cells had increased telomerase activity, longer telomeres and underwent more cell divisions. According to the donor, hTERT-NAC either delayed (n\u00a0=\u00a05) or prevented (n\u00a0=\u00a04) EC senescence, the latter leading to cell immortalization. Lack of cell immortalization by hTERT-NAC was accompanied by an absence of beneficial effect of NAC alone in paired EC. Accordingly, lack of EC immortalization by hTERT-NAC was associated with high endogenous susceptibility to oxidation. In EC where hTERT-NAC did not immortalize EC, p53, p21 and p16 expression increased with senescence, while oxidative-dependent DNA damage associated with senescence was not prevented.Our data suggest that irreversible oxidative stress-dependent damages associated with cardiovascular risk factors are responsible for senescence of EC from atherosclerotic patients.",

Because it is unlikely that many would be willing or able to maintain a DR lifestyle, there has been intense interest in mimicking its beneficial effects on health, and potentially longevity, with drugs. To date, such efforts have been hindered primarily by our lack of mechanistic understanding of how DR works. Sirtuins, NAD+-dependent deacetylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases that influence lifespan in lower organisms, have been proposed to be key mediators of DR, and based on this model, the sirtuin activator resveratrol has been proposed as a candidate DR mimetic. Indeed, resveratrol extends lifespan in yeast, worms, flies, and a short-lived species of fish. In rodents, resveratrol improves health, and prevents the early mortality associated with obesity, but its precise mechanism of action remains a subject of debate, and extension of normal lifespan has not been observed.

FGF23 also reduces serum vitamin D levels to suppress phosphate absorption from intestine. Thus, FGF23 functions as a hormone that induces negative phosphate balance. One critical feature of FGF23 is that it requires Klotho, a single-pass transmembrane protein expressed in renal tubules, as an obligate co-receptor to bind and activate cognate FGF receptors. Importantly, defects in either FGF23 or Klotho not only cause phosphate retention but also a premature-aging syndrome in mice, which can be rescued by resolving hyperphosphatemia. In addition, changes in extracellular and intracellular phosphate concentration affect glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and oxidative stress in vivo and in vitro, which potentially affect aging processes. These findings suggest an unexpected link between inorganic phosphate and aging in mammals.",

The derivatives of NAD+, such as reduced and oxidized forms of NAD(P)+, play important roles in maintaining and regulating cellular redox state, Ca2+ stores, DNA damage and repair, stress responses, cell cycle timing and lipid and energy metabolism. NAD+ is also a substrate for signaling enzymes like the sirtuins and poly-ADP-ribosylpolymerases, members of a broad family of protein deacetylases and ADP-ribosyltransferases that regulate fundamental cellular processes such as transcription, recombination, cell division, proliferation, genome maintenance, apoptosis, stress resistance and senescence.

Despite these important functions, the basic molecular determinants of SIRT6 enzymatic function \u2013 including the mechanistic and regulatory roles of specific domains of SIRT6 \u2013 are not well understood. Sirtuin proteins consist of a conserved central \u2018sirtuin domain\u2019 \u2013 thought to comprise an enzymatic core \u2013 flanked by variable N- and C-terminal extensions. Here, we report the identification of novel functions for the N- and C-terminal domains of the human SIRT6 protein. We show that the C-terminal extension (CTE) of SIRT6 contributes to proper nuclear localization but is dispensable for enzymatic activity. In contrast, the N-terminal extension (NTE) of SIRT6 is critical for chromatin association and intrinsic catalytic activity. Surprisingly, mutation of a conserved catalytic histidine residue in the core sirtuin domain not only abrogates SIRT6 enzymatic activity but also leads to impaired chromatin association in cells. Together, our observations define important biochemical and cellular roles of specific SIRT6 domains, and provide mechanistic insight into the potential role of these domains as targets for physiologic and pharmacologic modulation.",

DN-Dmp53 expression furthermore leads to reduction of Drosophila insulin-like peptide (dILP) 2 mRNA levels and a decrease in insulin/insulin-like growth factor-signaling activity (IIS) in the fly fat body. It is unclear by which mechanisms DN-Dmp53 extends longevity, and whether modulation of insulin-signaling activity plays a pivotal role in life span regulation by Dmp53. Here we show that life span extension due to DN-Dmp53 expression is likely due to reduction of Dmp53 activity and that decreased Dmp53 activity does not extend life span when dILP2 is concomitantly over expressed. Furthermore, extended longevity due to DN-Dmp53 expression does not further extend the life span of flies over expressing the IIS associated transcription factor dFoxO, indicating that DN-Dmp53-dependent life span extension may be related to IIS. However, reduction of dFoxO levels does not decrease DN-Dmp53-dependent longevity extension. Interestingly, when DN-Dmp53 is expressed in flies lacking the translation initiation controlling factor Thor/4E-BP, the downstream target of dTOR signaling, no increase in life span is observed. Taken together, these data suggest that Dmp53 may affect life span by differentially engaging the IIS and dTor pathways.",

In male animals, soleus and EDL muscle to body weight ratios decreased steadily with age while in the females, losses remained unchanged after 26 months. These age-related changes in the degree of muscle atrophy across sex were associated with differences in the regulation of Akt, mTOR, and p70s6k in the slow-twitch soleus and the regulation of AMPK, 4EBP1, p70s6k and rpS6 in the fast-twitch EDL. Irrespective of muscle type, aging in both the genders was associated with increased calcineurin expression. Taken together, these data suggest that indices of protein synthesis and muscle adaptation are regulated differently with aging in different muscle types and sex.",

     "abstract": "While there is evidence that longevity runs in families, the study of long-lived families is complicated by the fact that longevity-related information is available only for the oldest old, many of whom may be deceased and unavailable for testing, and information on other living family members, primarily descendents, is censored. This situation requires a creative approach for analyzing determinants of longevity in families. There are likely biomarkers that predict an individual's longevity, suggesting the possibility that those biomarkers which are heritable may constitute valuable endophenotypes for exceptional survival. These endophenotypes could be studied in families to identify human longevity genes and elucidate possible mechanisms of their influence on longevity. In this paper, we analyze data collected in the Long Life Family Study (LLFS) investigating whether indicators of physiological state, cognitive functioning and health/well-being among offspring predict longevity in parents. Good predictors can be used as endophenotypes for exceptional survival. Our analyses revealed significant associations between cumulative indices describing physiological state, as well as a number of offspring phenotypes, and parental lifespan, supporting both their familial basis and relevance to longevity. We conclude that the study of endophenotypes within families is a valid approach to the genetics of human longevity.",

The objective of this study is to find the most appropriate method of BA estimation by examining the association between Work Ability Index (WAI) and the differences of each algorithm's estimates from chronological age (CA). The WAI was found to be a measure that reflects an individual's current health status rather than the deterioration caused by a serious dependency with the age. Experiments were conducted on 200 Korean male participants using a BA estimation system developed principally under the concept of non-invasive, simple to operate and human function-based. Using the empirical data, BA estimation as well as various analyses including correlation analysis and discriminant function analysis was performed. As a result, it had been confirmed by the empirical data that Klemera and Doubal's method with uncorrelated variables from principal component analysis produces relatively reliable and acceptable BA estimates.",

Our purpose was to examine how aging affects the subcellular localization of apoptogenic factors involved in mitochondrially mediated cell death in cardiac muscle. Employing 6- and 36-month-old Fischer 344xBN animals, we assessed markers of organelle content and function, as well as the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartmentalization of proteins implicated in apoptosis. Aging was associated with decrements in cardiac mitochondrial content and respiratory function. These changes were accompanied by a greater cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c and AIF, as well as a higher mitochondrial Bax and a faster rate of permeability transition pore opening. Mitochondria from aged hearts demonstrated a greater enrichment of p66Shc and p46Shc providing further evidence of enhanced apoptogenic signaling. Opa1 was greater in the senescent myocardium, while Drp1 was higher in the mitochondrial fraction of aged, compared to the young animals. Furthermore, the level of fragmented DNA was greater in the hearts of senescent animals. Thus, the specific compartmentalization of apoptogenic proteins implies that mitochondrially mediated cell death signaling is highly active in the aged myocardium, which may contribute to progressive cardiac pathophysiology.",

To date, the validation of reference genes in aging has received little attention and suitable reference genes have not yet been defined. Our aim was to evaluate the expression stability of frequently used reference genes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with respect to aging. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we carried out an extensive evaluation of five housekeeping genes, i.e. 18s rRNA, ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1 and GUSB, for stability of expression in samples from donors in the age range 35\u201374 years.The consistency in the expression stability was quantified on the basis of the coefficient of variation and two algorithms termed geNorm and NormFinder. Our results indicated GUSB be the most suitable transcript and 18s the least for accurate normalization in PBMCs. We also demonstrated that aging is a confounding factor with respect to stability of 18s, HPRT1 and ACTB expression, which were particularly prone to variability in aged donors.",

This case\u2013control study combines an AD material (725 cases and 845 controls), and a cataract material (489 cases and 182 controls). Genetic variation in NFE2L2 and KEAP1 was tagged by eight and three tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), respectively. Single SNPs and haplotypes were analyzed for associations with disease risk, age parameters, MMSE and AD cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. NFE2L2 and KEAP1 were not associated with risk of AD or cataract. However, one haplotype allele of NFE2L2 was associated with 2 years earlier age at AD onset (pc\u00a0=\u00a00.013) and 4 years earlier age at surgery for posterior subcapsular cataract (pc\u00a0=\u00a00.019). Another haplotype of NFE2L2 was associated with 4 years later age at surgery for cortical cataract (pc\u00a0=\u00a00.009).

To investigate potential differences underlying the CR response in male DBA/2 and C57BL/6 mice, we examined several metabolic parameters following acute (1\u20135 weeks) 30% CR. Acute CR decreased body mass (BM) in both strains, with lean and fat mass decreasing in proportion to BM. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) was unaltered by CR, following appropriate corrections for BM differences, although RMR was higher in DBA/2 compared to C57BL/6 mice. Acute CR decreased fed blood glucose levels in both strains, decreased fasting blood glucose in C57BL/6 mice but increased fasting levels in DBA/2 mice. Glucose tolerance improved after 1 week of CR in C57BL/6 mice but improved only after 4 weeks in DBA/2 mice. Acute CR had no effect on insulin levels, but lowered insulin sensitivity and decreased insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels in both strains. DBA/2 mice were hyperinsulinaemic and insulin resistant compared to C57BL/6 mice. These strain-specific differences in glucose homeostatic parameters may underlie the reported unresponsiveness of DBA/2 mice to CR. We also demonstrate delineation in the response of insulin and IGF-1 to acute CR in mice.",

The potentiation of NO production by l-Arg was significantly suppressed by L-NIO (eNOS-specific inhibitor) in young HUVECs and was suppressed by 1400W (iNOS-specific inhibitor) in aged HUVECs.

Little is known, however, about potential correlations between long-term culture of neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs), changed differentiation and self-renewal capacities, and the occurrence of chromosomal instability. This study investigates the effect of extended culture time on self-renewal, differentiation capacity, cell cycle phase distribution, telomere length, telomerase activity and chromosomal stability on fetal brain-derived cells that form floating sphere colonies (neurospheres). We observed that increased sphere-forming capacity indicative of increased proliferation was accompanied by a decreased ability to differentiate into neural lineages. The high mobility group A (Hmga2) gene positively regulates self-renewal via repression of p16Ink4a and p19ARF gene expression. This study discerned an upregulation of Hmga2 gene and protein expression and decreased p16Ink4a and p19ARF gene expression, suggesting that Hmga2 might promote the proliferation of neurosphere cells in long-term culture. Further, our analyses revealed a significant decrease in telomere length after 4 weeks of culturing that is paralleled by a moderate upregulation of telomerase activity. Importantly, regular gain of chromosome 1 with random structural chromosomal aberrations was observed within 16 weeks of neurosphere cell culture. Genetic instability and diminished differentiation capacity seem to be a consequence of long-term culture of neurosphere cells. These data indicate the necessity to analyze self-renewal, differentiation capacity, telomere length, tumor suppressor genes and chromosomal stability in neurosphere cultures prior to their usage in basic research, drug testing or the development of therapeutic strategies.",

Respiration parameters were obtained using a Clarke-type electrode. Aged rats displayed no significant alterations in respiration, indicating mitochondria must be more resilient to the aging process than previously thought. Synaptic mitochondria displayed lower respiration capacities than the extrasynaptic fraction. Aged F344 rats appear capable of normal electron transport chain function without declines in ability to produce ATP. Markers of cortical oxidative damage (3-nitrotyrosine [3-NT], 4-hydroxynonenal [4-HNE], and protein carbonyls [PC]) were collected from the post-mitochondrial supernatant (PMS) from the contralateral hemisphere, and from mitochondrial samples following respiration analysis. Age-related increases in PC and 3-NT levels were found in synaptic mitochondria, whereas significant extrasynaptic elevations were only found in middle aged rats. These findings support an age-related increase in oxidative damage in the cortex, while proposing the two fractions of mitochondria are differentially affected by the aging process. Levels of oxidative damage that accumulates in the cortex with age does not appear to significantly impair cortical mitochondrial respiration of F344 rats.",

We found that during aging subunit composition and subcellular distribution of proteasomes changed without substantial alterations in the total level of core complexes. We observed that the general decline in proteasomes functions was limited to nuclear and cytosolic compartments. Surprisingly, the observed changes in activity and specificity were linked to the amount of the activator module and distinct composition of the catalytic subunits. In contrast, activity, specificity and composition of the microsomal-associated proteasomes remained mostly unaffected by aging; however their relative contribution to the total activity was substantially elevated. Unexpectedly, the nuclear proteasomes were affected most profoundly by aging possibly triggering significant changes in cellular signaling and transcription.

A few years ago, an unexpected finding showed that the inactivation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) in Caenorhabditis elegans, during the developmental stages only, extended lifespan. Activation of this mitochondrial pathway affecting aging (MIT) is associated with several phenotypic features: increased longevity, increased time of development, decreased fertility/fecundity and reduced adult size. Here, we investigated this pathway in another model organism, Drosophila melanogaster. To assess the role of mitochondrial activity in the Drosophila aging process, we partially inactivated the MRC using RNA interference (RNAi) during larval stages. Developmental perturbation of the respiratory process prolonged development, increased lethality during developmental stage, reduced both fecundity and fertility and slightly reduced individual weight. However, in contrast to the nematode, this genetic intervention either shortened or had no effect on lifespan, depending on the level of gene inactivation. Thus, the effects of MRC disruption during development on aging differ between species. We discuss the possible origins of such differences.",

Indeed, the greatest number of up-regulated genes in young mice encoded components of the extracellular matrix required for the maintenance of the satellite cell niche. Moreover, other genes included Wnt inhibitors (Wif1 and Sfrp2) and Notch activator (Dner), which are putatively involved in the interconnected signalling networks that control satellite cell function. The widespread expression differences for inhibitors of TGFbeta signalling further emphasize the shortcomings in satellite cell performance. Therefore, we draw attention to the breakdown of features required to maintain satellite cell integrity during the ageing process.",

     "abstract": "Silent information regulators are potent NAD+-dependent protein deacetylases, which have been shown to regulate gene silencing, muscle differentiation and DNA damage repair. Here, changes in the level and activity of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in response to exercise in groups of young and old rats were studied. There was an age-related increase in SIRT1 level, while exercise training significantly increased the relative activity of SIRT1. A strong inverse correlation was found between the nuclear activity of SIRT1 and the level of acetylated proteins. Exercise training induced SIRT1 activity due to the positive effect of exercise on the activity of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and thereby the production of sirtuin-fueling NAD+. Exercise training normalized the age-associated shift in redox balance, since exercised animals had significantly lower levels of carbonylated proteins, expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and vascular endothelial growth factor. The age-associated increase in the level of SIRT6 was attenuated by exercise training. On the other hand, aging did not significantly increase the level of DNA damage, which was in line with the activity of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, while exercise training increased the level of this enzyme. Regular exercise decelerates the deleterious effects of the aging process via SIRT1-dependent pathways through the stimulation of NAD+ biosynthesis by NAMPT.",

     "abstract": "Research into the age-associated decline in the immune system has focused on the factors that contribute to the accumulation of senescent CD8 T cells. Less attention has been paid to the non-immune factors that may maintain the pool of na\u00efve CD8 T cells. Here, we analyzed the status of the na\u00efve CD8 T-cell population in healthy nonagenarians (\u226590-year-old), old (60\u201379-year-old), and young (20\u201334-year-old) subjects. Na\u00efve CD8 T cells were defined as CD28+CD95\u2212 as this phenotype showed a strong co-expression of the CD45RA+, CD45RO\u2212, and CD127+ phenotypes. Although there was an age-associated decline in the percentage of CD28+CD95\u2212 CD8 T cells, the healthy nonagenarians maintained a pool of na\u00efve CD28+CD95\u2212 cells that contained T-cell receptor excision circles (TREC)+ cells. The percentages of na\u00efve CD28+CD95\u2212 CD8 T cells in the nonagenarians correlated with the sera levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and leptin. Higher levels of triiodothyronine (T3) negatively correlated with the accumulation of TREC\u2212CD28\u2212CD95+ CD8 T cells from nonagenarians. These results suggest a model in which IGFBP3, leptin and T3 act as non-immune factors to maintain a larger pool of na\u00efve CD8 T cells in healthy nonagenarians.",

     "abstract": "Age-related changes in cardiomyocytes reduce the capacity to recover from acute injury or to adapt during chronic disease in advanced age. N-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6PUFA) lead to higher lipid peroxidation during aging than the less oxidizable monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA); and coenzyme Q (CoQ)-supplemented n-6PUFA lengthens the lifespan and reduces peroxidation in comparison to non-supplemented n-6PUFA. Here, lifelong feeding on MUFA, n-6PUFA, and n-6 PUFA\u00a0+\u00a0CoQ was compared regarding age-related alterations in rat heart. Less mitochondrial area and perimeter were reported for aged n-6 PUFA-fed animals while MUFA led to a higher density of mitochondrial cristae. Mitochondrial complexes and cytochrome c oxidase activity decreased with aging (except complex I and cytochrome c oxidase in n-6 PUFA\u00a0+\u00a0CoQ), while increased apoptosis-inducing factor was found with aging. MUFA led to lower mitochondrial DNA-deletion frequency. The lowest hydroperoxide levels for aged animals were found for n-6 PUFA\u00a0+\u00a0CoQ, which also showed lower concentrations than did n-6 PUFA. For protein oxidation, specific carbonyl compounds were lower in aged animals; meanwhile lipoxidation-derived protein-oxidation markers were higher. The results suggest that MUFA can protect mitochondria from age-related changes, and that CoQ supplementation to n-6 PUFA partially resembles MUFA benefits. Moreover, under our experimental conditions, lipid-derived oxidative damage appears to be more important than the pure protein-derived oxidative damage during aging.",

     "abstract": "Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels have been observed in mammals during aging, implying an important role of ROS in the aging process. Most bird species are known to live longer and to contain lower ROS levels than mammals of the same body weight. The influence of ROS on the aging process of birds has been investigated using pigeon embryonic fibroblasts (PEF) and chicken embryonic fibroblasts (CEF). ROS levels in young avian cells were much lower than in human cells. When cultivated till replicative senescence, PEF proliferated about one-third longer compared to CEF. However, both senescent avian cell populations showed no increased ROS levels or accumulation of ROS-induced damage on the mtDNA or protein level. The investigation for quality control (QC) mechanisms revealed that the autophagosomal/lysosomal pathway was not downregulated in old avian cells and stable overexpression of the autophagy protein ATG5 improved mitochondrial fitness, enhanced the resistance against oxidative stress and prolonged the life span of CEF. Oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis induced a dose-dependent cell proliferation in CEF as well as in PEF. Taken together, our data indicate that autophagy and compensatory proliferation act as QC mechanisms, while ROS did not influence the aging process in avian cells.",

     "abstract": "Although most fungi appear to be immortal, some show systemic senescence within a distinct time frame. Podospora anserina for example shows an irreversible growth arrest within weeks of culturing associated with a destabilization of the mitochondrial genome. Here, we show that calorie restriction (CR), a regimen of under-nutrition without malnutrition, increases not only life span but also forestalls the aging-related decline in fertility. Similar to respiratory chain deficiencies the life span extension is associated with lower levels of intracellular H2O2 measurements and a stabilization of the mitochondrial genome. Unlike respiratory chain deficiencies, CR cultures have a wild-type-like OXPHOS machinery similar to that of well-fed cultures as shown by native electrophoresis of mitochondrial protein complexes. Together, these data indicate that life span extension via CR is fundamentally different from that via respiratory chain mutations: Whereas the latter can be seen as a pathology, the former promotes healthy life span extension and may be an adaptive response.",
