     "abstract": "The steady increase in the number of people suffering from chronic diseases and increasing life expectancy raises new demands on health care. At the same time, the need for informal caregivers is increasing. This study aims to perform a systematic review of the methodologies used to identify effect of different types of training on informal caregivers and their older persons.MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL and Ovid were searched from December 2016 and April 2017. The following keywords were used; \"informal caregiver\", \"training\" \"elderly\", older persons\". Identified publications were screened by using the following inclusion criteria; systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort and multicentre studies, English language full text journals, samples or interventions that included caregivers of older persons and published in last 10 years.Twenty four studies (12 randomised control trials, 8 intervention studies and 4 systematic reviews) were included. Most of the randomized controlled trials involved both caregivers and elderly. Pretests and post-tests were used in intervention studies (5 out of the 8 studies). ICT-based, psychosocial interventions on family caregivers' education program for caregivers were applied. Caregivers following a supportive educative learning had a significantly better quality of life.The findings of this systematic review suggest that support interventions for caregivers can be effective in reducing caregivers' stress, with a consequent improvement of the quality of care. However, results are based on relatively small studies, reporting somewhat controversial findings supporting the need to perform further research in this field.",

     "abstract": "We explored the bidirectional association between depressive symptoms and measures of carotid atherosclerosis. This study included 1155 participants aged 55 years and older. Depressive symptoms was assessed by 30-item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30) score. Common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CCA-IMT), carotid plaques and carotid stenosis were measured at both common carotid arteries using an edge detection system. In part 1, we explored the risk of CCA-IMT on depressive symptoms. We identified a significantly increased risk of depressive symptoms with the severity of carotid atherosclerosis. ORs (95%CI) of CCA-IMT thickening, carotid plaque and carotid stenosis for depressive symptoms were 1.48(0.72\u20133.03), 2(1.03\u20133.85) and 5.29(2.16\u201312.97) comparing with normal CCA-IMT in adjusting all potential risk factors models. When using carotid atherosclerosis as a continuous variable, the OR for depressive symptoms was 1.32 (95%CI 1.16\u20131.49) with every 0.1mm elevated in CCA-IMT after adjustment for all potential confounders. In part 2, we explored the risk of depressive symptoms on carotid atherosclerosis. We found elevated depressive symptoms significantly increased the risk of carotid atherosclerosis in multi-factor adjusted models [OR (95%CI): 1.65(1.10\u20132.47)]. When using depressive symptoms as a continuous variable, the ORs for carotid artery atherosclerosis were 1.32 (95%CI 1.16\u20131.49) with every 1 GDS-30 score elevated after adjustment for all convenient risk factors. The current study demonstrated the bidirectional links of carotid atherosclerosis measures with depressive symptoms. More cohort study and clinical trial focusing on the issue need to be explored in the future.",

They appear to have adapted well to their lives and are likely to be influenced by previous lifestyle habits, and their life satisfaction is influenced by mental and psychological health.The aim of this study is to explore centenarians\u2019 lifestyles by sex and their potential contribution to life satisfaction.In order to examine the common characteristics of centenarians in Hainan and the potential differences between men and women, a cross-sectional survey was conducted with 223 cognitively-intact Chinese centenarians. We also explored the association between life satisfaction and other physical factors using binary logistic regression and principal component analysis.The results provided supplementary evidence indicating that women tended to live longer than men. However, the difference in life satisfaction observed between the sexes was not obvious (p\u2009=\u20090.659). The proportion of physical factors between each sex showed a similar trend in distribution. Most centenarians\u2019 lifestyles were similar, in that they followed a light diet and did not smoke or drink alcohol. Centenarians in better physical condition and with higher self-assessment, as well as those with \u201calcohol and tobacco habits,\u201d were more satisfied with their life. Of the factors examined in the binary logistic regression, sleep satisfaction was the only factor significantly positively correlated with life satisfaction (p\u2009<\u2009.01).The research findings elucidated physiological and psychological health in centenarians and provided a model of healthy aging strategies for reference purposes.",

Our objective was to determine whether higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentration correlated with less severe first-diagnosed bullous pemphigoid (BP) in older inpatients.This cross-sectional study was performed from November 2012 to February 2014 among 30 consecutive older inpatients (21 women; mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, 83\u2009\u00b1\u20097 years; all Caucasian) with a de novo diagnosis of active BP recruited in the Department of Dermatology of Angers University Hospital, France. The severity of BP was graded clinically on the basis of i) the number of bullae during the first three days of hospitalization (grade 0\u20134, worse), and ii) the extent of the lesions (grade 0\u20135, worse).Sixteen participants had \u2264 5 bullae at the time of diagnosis, 8 had 6\u201320 bullae, 3 had 20\u201350 bullae, and 3 had >50 bullae. The lesions were spread over 5 cutaneous areas in 5 participants (17%). The median 25OHD concentration was 23 [IQR, 16\u201342] nmol/L. Serum 25OHD concentration was inversely correlated with the bullae grade (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.38, p\u2009=\u20090.04) and the lesion extension grade (\u03c1\u2009=\u2009\u2212\u20090.50, p\u2009=\u20090.005).Higher serum 25OHD concentration correlated with less severe BP prior to initiation of treatment among our sample of older inpatients. This result suggests that vitamin D may be involved in the pathophysiology of BP and could serve as prognostic biomarker of BP.",

All demographic characteristics, mental status, depressive mood, functional status, and frailty were determined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to calculate the cut-off of the SNAQ according to both the MNA long and short forms for malnutrition or risk of malnutrition. Reliability and validation of the SNAQ was analysed.We included 905 community-dwelling elderly, but those with middle-stage dementia (MMSE score <18, n\u202f=\u202f30) were excluded.

In this study, we proposed a loneliness of model of hypochondriasis among older adults in which loneliness triggers a maladaptive threat response in which there is greater self-focus, leading to hypochondriasis through greater intolerance of uncertainty and anxious symptoms. Community-dwelling older adults (N = 280) participated in an interview survey. Results found that loneliness was associated with higher hypochondriasis even after controlling for perceived health status and relationship status. Loneliness had a serial indirect effect on hypochondriasis through higher intolerance of uncertainty and anxious symptoms. With intolerance of uncertainty and anxious symptoms in the model, the relationship between loneliness and hypochondriasis was no longer significant, suggesting full mediation. The results support a loneliness model of hypochondriasis among older adults. Health care professionals working with older adults suffering from hypochondriacal concerns may wish to consider social factors such as loneliness.",

     "abstract": "There are various \u2018quality of life\u2019 scales developed for older people. Although quality of life is a subjective concept, most of these scales are based on expert opinions rather than perspectives of older people. The aim of this study is to evaluate validity and reliability of Older People\u2019s Quality of Life-brief scale (OPQOL-brief), which is based on perspectives of older people, in Turkish population.A cross-sectional study was implemented in a Geriatric medicine outpatient clinic. Total number of 168 older patients who speak in Turkish fluently were recruited. Comprehensive geriatric assessment and OPQOL-brief was applied to all participants together with another quality of life scale validated in Turkish population, CASP-19 (Control, Autonomy, Self-realization, Pleasure). Validity was evaluated with construct validity, convergent validity and discriminant validity. Reliability was assessed with internal consistency and test-retest reliability.Mean age of the study population was 73.3\u2009\u00b1\u20095.9 years. Female participants were 64.9% (n\u2009=\u2009109). Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 coefficient. OPQOL-brief scale demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1\u2009=\u20090.876). Test-retest reliability was assessed by interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and showed high reliability (ICC\u2009=\u20090.98, 95%CI\u2009=\u20090.96-0.99, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Strong and significant correlation was detected between OPQOL-brief and CASP-19 scales (r\u2009=\u20090.763, p\u2009<\u20090.001).Turkish version of OPQOL-brief has acceptable validity and reliability in Turkish population. The scale can be used to measure quality of life of older people.",

Although the association between MMT and muscle strength is also known, the quality of the masseter muscle were not assessed in detail previously. We examined the relationship of masseter muscle echo intensity (MMEI) with skeletal muscle, physical function, and nutrition status, in order to determine whether MMEI could be a good indicator of these parameters.We assessed 139 community-dwelling elderly individuals (men: 65, women: 74). Age, body mass index (BMI), skeletal muscle mass index, grip strength, walking speed, calf circumference, tooth-loss (Eichner classification), occlusal force, MMT, and MMEI were obtained. In multiple regression analysis, MMEI were set as dependent variables.Multiple regression analysis revealed BMI (p < 0.05), grip strength (p < 0.01), walking speed (p < 0.01), and MMT (p < 0.01) as factors with significant association with MMEI.MMT is related to occlusal force and MMEI. MMEI was related strongly to grip strength and walking speed, but not to tooth-loss. However, MMEI, which is easily determined ultrasonographically, could be a good indicator of grip strength and walking speed, and thus may be predictive of dynapenia.",

To investigate the influence of hip joint dysfunction on motor disorders, we determined the JHEQ and GLFS-25 scores and performed muscle strength testing in female patients with hip osteoarthritis.The subjects were 108 women who had received THA, 56 women scheduled for THA, and 64 women on conservative treatment. The JHEQ score (evaluation scale for hip joint function) and GLFS-25 score (evaluation scale for ADL) were determined and muscle strength testing was conducted at a routine outpatient visit.A strong correlation was found between the total JHEQ score and the GLFS-25 score (r = - 0.837). Patients after THA and patients with successful conservative treatment aged 60\u201379 years showed similar motor function to healthy persons of the same age.

Mortality was ascertained from the death registry and fractures were self-reported. Baseline appendicular lean mass (ALM) was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and normalised to body mass index (BMI). Hand grip strength (HGS) was assessed by dynamometer. Osteosarcopenia and osteodynapenia were defined as having T-scores of the total hip and/or lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) < \u20131 combined with being in the lowest 20% of the sex-specific distribution for ALM/BMI or HGS respectively.Results: Incident fracture risk was significantly higher in participants who were osteodynapenic (RR\u2009=\u20092.07, 95% CI: 1.26\u20133.39), dynapenic alone (RR\u2009=\u20091.74, 95% CI: 1.05\u20132.87), and osteopenic alone (RR\u2009=\u20091.63, 95% CI: 1.15\u20132.31), compared to those without dynapenia or osteopenia. Mortality risk was significantly higher only in participants with osteosarcopenia (RR\u2009=\u20091.49, 95% CI: 1.01\u20132.21) compared to those without sarcopenia or osteopenia. However, osteosarcopenia and osteodynapenia did not lead to a significantly greater fracture or mortality risk compared to having these conditions on their own.Conclusion: These findings suggest that the combined effect of osteopenia and sarcopenia or dynapenia on fracture and mortality risk, respectively, may not be greater than that of each individual condition.",

Participants included 618 Colombian adults aged 60\u201392 years. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted. Regarding the subjective well-being, neuroticism was associated with lower scores on life satisfaction, and positively associated with negative affect, whereas extroversion and conscientiousness were associated with higher scores on life satisfaction and positive affect. For psychological well-being, neuroticism showed a negative and significant association with all of the psychological well-being dimensions, except purpose in life, whereas extroversion and conscientiousness showed a significant and positive relationship with the six dimensions. Neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness represent personality predispositions for general well-being. Extraversion and conscientiousness are predictors of optimal aging.

The first step of successful fall prevention is to identify those at risk of falling. Recent technology advancement offers the possibility of objective, lowcost and self-guided fall risk assessment. The present work evaluated the preliminary validity and usability of a Kinect camera-based selfinitiated fall risk assessment system in a hospital setting. A convenience sample of 29 female participants (77.5\u2009\u00b1\u20097.9 years old) enrolled in this study. This low-cost self-guided system included a Kinect depth-sensing camera, a PC-based computer, and custom-built software. An onscreen Fall Risk Assessment Avatar (FRAAn) utilizing visual and verbal instructions led participants through a fall risk assessment consisting of self-report measures and clinically validated balance and mobility tests. Participants also completed clinical fall risk evaluation (Timed-Up and Go, and Berg Balance Scale) led by a researcher. User experience was evaluated by the System Usability Scale (SUS). Results indicate that FRAAn-based outcome measures (postural sway metrics, and sit-to-stand speed) were highly correlated with clinical fall risk measures, and were able to differentiate individuals with increased fall risk. Additionally, 83% participants reported high usability (SUS > 80), indicating the system is well received among older users. Overall, our results indicate that the FRAAn system has promise for providing a self-guided fall risk assessment, and is well received by older users. This affordable, portable and self-guided system has potential to facilitate objective fall risk assessment in older adults in various settings.",

The prevalence in people between 60\u201370 years is about 5\u201313% and in adults over 80 years, between 11\u201350% in the USA. Sarcopenia increases the risk of mortality and nosocomial infections.Community-acquired pneumonia is the first infectious-related cause of death in elderly people. However, there is lack of evidence about the association between sarcopenia and pneumonia. The aim of our study was to determine the incidence and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia in older adults with sarcopenia in a Peruvian hospital.A retrospective cohort study was conducted in the geriatrics service of Centro Medico Naval \u201cCirujano Mayor Santiago Tavara\u201d.

Results showed that the average baseline scores on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ) and Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) were 9.07 and 26.01, respectively. The proportions of smoking and exercising at baseline were 24.12% and 58.67%, respectively. A linear regression analysis indicated that old adults who were current and consistent exercisers had better subsequent 4-year SPMSQ scores than those who were not exercisers (P\u2009<\u20090.05). The MNA score was positively associated with subsequent 4- and 8-year SPMSQ scores for the 65\u201374-year-old adults (P\u2009<\u2009 0.05). The logistic regression analysis showed that current and consistent exercise was negatively associated with subsequent 4-year cognitive decline (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Previous exercise experience was positively associated with subsequent 8-year cognitive decline for the \u226575-year-old adults (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Few studies have investigated the association of circulating miRNA with the early stages of cognitive impairment, such as mild cognitive impairment, in the general population. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between cognitive function and several serum miRNAs levels related to amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis in a Japanese general population who had never been diagnosed with dementia.We conducted a cross-sectional study of 337 Japanese subjects (144 men, 193 women) who attended a health examination. The short form of the Mini-Mental State Examination (SMMSE) was used to assess cognitive function. Serum levels of 6 miRNAs (let-7d, miR-17, miR-20a, miR-27a, miR-34a, miR-103a) were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.Multivariable-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for lower SMMSE score (SMMSE score < 28) were significantly increased in the lowest tertile of serum miR-20a (OR, 2.08; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09\u20134.04) and miR-103a (OR, 1.91; 95%CI, 1.00\u20133.69) compared to the highest tertile.

In particular, we examined technical feasibility, and the feasibility of participant recruitment, data collection and analysis.AMBIENT was installed in a specialized dementia inpatient unit. AMBIENT captured gait bouts as the participants walked within the view of the sensor during their daily routine and computed the spatiotemporal parameters of gait.Twenty participants (age: 76.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7 years, female: 50%) were recruited over a period of 6 months. We recorded a total of 3843 gait bouts, of which 1171 could be used to extract gait data. On average, 58\u2009\u00b1\u200947 walking sequences per person were collected over a recording period of 28\u2009\u00b1\u200920 days. We were able to consistently extract six quantitative parameters of gait, consisting of stride length, stride time, cadence, velocity, step length asymmetry, and step time asymmetry.This study demonstrates the feasibility of longitudinal tracking of gait in a dementia inpatient setting. This technology has important potential applications in monitoring functional status over time, and the development of dynamic falls risk assessments.",

     "abstract": "Few studies consider multiple pathways for explaining the gendered patterns of depression in Europe\u2019s aged population, although ageing is often associated with an increased exposure to risk factors for depression, and the relevance of these risk factors is likely to differ between countries.Based on the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we assess the relevance of gender inequalities in the exposure to psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors for explaining the gender gap in depression. Further, we investigate the association between depressive symptoms and these explanatory variables by gender and analyse whether their relevance differs between countries.Both the prevalence of depression by gender and the magnitude of the gender gap were low in Northern Europe and rather high in Southern Europe. Part of the gender gap was explained by psychosocial, socio-economic, and health-related factors but significant gender differences remained. Health-related factors were of outstanding importance for explaining within-country variation in depressive symptoms for both women and men. With regard to psychosocial and socio-economic factors, the results were less clear.The assessment of gender inequalities in depression and their determinants within different social policy contexts enables evidence-based interventions to reduce the gender gap and ensure high quality of life for older men and women. To that end, the reduction of health-related risk factors seems to be of utmost importance in all European countries, whereas interventions in the area of socio-economic and psychosocial risk factors should be gender- and context-specific.",

Descriptive univariate information for individual variables and four dimensions of social exclusion are presented. Multinomial and binary logistic regression models are used to examine the associations between social exclusion and self-rated health and depression.Older people who were in the lower level of exclusion from social relationships or subjective feelings of exclusion were significantly less likely to report fair or poor self-rated health than people in the higher level of exclusion (lower level of exclusion from social activities was significantly associated with being less likely to report poor SRH only). Older people who were in the lower level of subjective feeling of exclusion or exclusion from financial products were significantly less likely to report depression.Different dimensions of social exclusion have different effects on self-rated health and depression. Social policies need to reflect this and efforts of services could usefully be oriented to prevent multi-dimensions of social exclusion. Ultimately, such policies should have the potential to enhance the health of older people in China.",

Dementia was defined as having at least one registered diagnosis of dementia in the National Patient Register. The incidence of dementia in different immigrant groups, using Swedish-born as referents, was assessed by Cox regression, expressed in hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). All models were stratified by sex and adjusted for age, geographical residence in Sweden, educational level, marital status, and neighbourhood socioeconomic status.A total of 136,713 individuals had a registered dementia event, i.e. 4.2%; 3.6% among men and 4.9% among women.

Identifying modifiable predictors is essential for developing effective strategies that would increase time spent out-of-home by older adults. This study examined social and physical environmental predictors of objectively measured out-of-home time spent among older adults with cognitive decline.This study was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial (n\u2009=\u2009147). Out-of-home time per day was measured by a Global Positioning System at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Baseline data of social environment (living alone, social network [Japanese version of the Lubben Social Network Scale]), objective physical environment (road network distance from each home address to nearest supermarket store, convenience store, and public transportation), and demographic factors (gender, age, education, driving status, fear of falling) were examined as potential predictors.After adjusting main effects of allocation group, time of measures, and their interactive effect, a mixed model showed that younger age (p\u2009=\u20090.044), current driving status (p\u2009=\u20090.039), and stronger social network (p\u2009=\u20090.003) were predictors of out-of-home time. However, none of the physical environmental factors significantly predicted outdoor time.The present study found that social network was a predictor of objectively measured out-of-home time among older adults with global cognitive decline. A sufficient social network might help increase out-of-home time among them. However, the influence of physical environment on out-of-home time might be small.",

Human skin will undergo extrinsic aging, known as photoaging upon prolonged exposure to sunlight which is characterized by wrinkles, dryness, loss of elasticity, and so on. The model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans which is widely used in aging studies, could be used to study photoaging also. Transcription factor DAF-16, which regulates longevity, stress resistance and many other physiological events, mediates the photoaging mechanism in C. elegans. Elevation in extracellular ROS and altered expression of SGK-1 indicates the role of DAF-16 during UV-A exposure. Further, the role of daf-2, the receptor gene and lys-7, an effector gene of DAF-16 were characterized through mutant based studies. The long lived daf-2 mutants upon UV-A exposure showed reduction in lifespan, but the upregulation of daf-16 allowed the other molecular mechanisms like healthspan, antimicrobial and stress resistance to be active. In the case of lys-7 mutants, the lifespan was reduced and all other molecular mechanisms were also downregulated. However, the daf-16 mutants showed no change in lifespan irrespective of UV-A exposure. This signifies the role of DAF-16 during UV-A mediated photoaging in C. elegans. The present study helps in understanding the role of daf-16 in UV-A mediated stress response which will be of considerable importance in the field of pharmacy in designing targets for specific agents against photoaging.",

In order to investigate co-production, we set out to review the evidence concerning personhood and dignity in dementia care.We adopted a meta-ethnographic approach to synthesise the predominantly- qualitative literature on personhood and dignity in dementia care using EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ASSIA databases. We also included relevant policy documents. Members of Patient and Public Involvement (PPI) group were consulted throughout.A total of 14 empirical studies were subjected to content analysis. Three themes were identified: dignity and personhood, coping with dementia, and barriers to dignity in care. The findings suggest that positive strategies and coping mechanisms are associated with superior outcomes in relation to: sense of self, dignity and quality of care. The 22 policy documents yielded six themes pertaining to co-production: the part played by the person with dementia, family, environment, behaviour, governance and law, and health care partnership.Personhood in dementia care is enhanced through co-production, by actively participating in social, civic and political life. This is promoted through behavioural changes at the micro and macro levels of society, including providers of care being trained in co-producing care and policy makers creating opportunities with, rather than for people with dementia.",

Our study examines the profile of IMAT across a spectrum of body compositions and associations with physical performance and inflammatory biomarkers including Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), a novel biomarker of adipose tissue inflammation.187 community dwelling elderly participants were recruited and classified into 4 subgroups: normal, obese, sarcopenia and SO, using validated criteria for sarcopenia and waist circumference to define central obesity. We performed magnetic resonance imaging of mid-thigh sections to segment IMAT and muscle. Participants were assessed for muscle strength, physical performance and blood inflammatory biomarkers of interleukin-6, C-Reactive Protein and MCP-1. We examined correlation of IMAT(ratio) with muscle function measures and blood biomarkers. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine the association of body composition types and IMAT(ratio) with muscle function.IMAT(ratio) was highest in SO and obese groups. Overall, higher IMAT(ratio) is significantly associated with raised MCP-1, lower gait speed and muscle strength. SO had lowest scores in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), gait speed, hand-grip and knee extension strength. IMAT(ratio) is independently associated with SPPB and handgrip strength, whilst SO is independently associated with muscle strength.Our results suggest the possible role of IMAT as a candidate imaging biomarker for adipose tissue inflammation and associated poorer functional outcomes in SO.",

Visual impairment was categorized as follows: normal vision, moderate vision impairment, and severe vision impairment. Dental treatments were categorized as conservative, prosthodontic, implant, periodontal, surgical, preventive, or others. All data were statistically analyzed using a negative binomial regression.Main outcome measure: Frequency of dental care utilization.Results: Approximately 50% of the subjects had visual impairment. The frequency of dental care utilization for patients with severe vision impairment was 41% less than patients with normal vision. The dental care utilization for implant treatment was two times higher and periodontal treatment was 1.7 times lower than the conservative treatments among patients who reported moderate and severe vision impairment, respectively.Conclusions: Visual impairment has a negative association with dental care utilization among older adults. It is imperative to implement systematic interventions to prevent visual impairment from becoming a barrier to dental care in this population.",

Migration status included: urban residents, rural residents, urban-to-urban, rural-to-urban, rural-to-rural, and urban-to-rural migrants. Cognitive function was assessed by immediate and delayed recall tests, digit span tests, and verbal fluency test. Ordinary least square regression models were used to adjust for sociodemographic characteristics, psychosocial factors, health behaviors, and physical health status.Controlling for multiple covariates, significant differences in cognitive function were found between men and women, and across migration groups. A consistent female disadvantage was found in China and India for cognitive function. Women who were rural residents or rural-to-rural migrants had the poorest cognitive function in both the Chinese and the Indian samples. Among males in China, rural residents had poorer cognitive function than urban residents, while urban-to-urban migrants had highest cognition scores; however, for male counterparts in India, rural-to-rural migrants had the poorest cognitive function.The results suggest that the association between migration and cognitive function differs by gender and country. In our study populations, major sociodemographic characteristics play a key role in accounting for the differences in cognitive function.",

The objective of this study was to identify patterns of aged care use among older Australian women and to examine how these patterns were associated with their demographic and health-related characteristics.The sample consisted of 8768 women from the 1921\u20131926 birth cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women\u2019s Health (ALSWH), who had survived to age 75-80 years. ALSWH survey and linked administrative aged care and death datasets from 2001 to 2011 were utilized. Patterns of aged care use were identified using a repeated measure latent class analysis.We identified four patterns of aged care use over time, differentiated by timing of service onset, types of service use and time of death. Approximately 41% of the sample were non-users or using basic home and community care (HACC), while 24% were at high risk of using moderate to high-level HACC/community aged care package (CACP). Only 11% had a greater risk of using residential aged care (RAC) over time. Being widowed, residing in remote/regional areas, having difficulty in managing income, having a chronic condition, reporting poor/fair self-rated health, and lower SF-36 quality of life scores were associated with an increased odds of being a member of the following classes: 1) moderate to high-level HACC/CACP, 2) increasing RAC, and 3) early mortality, compared with the non-user class.Distinct patterns of aged care use were identified. These results will facilitate future capacity planning for aged care systems in Australia.",

In fully adjusted analyses, females, older age, high household income (\u2265MYR4000), inadequate fruits and vegetables consumption (<5 servings/day), high sedentary time, having diabetes, and having mobility impairment were all associated with physical inactivity. Approximately half of the Malaysian older population are physically inactive. Identifying the correlates of physical inactivity among Malaysian older adults will help to develop public health policies and interventions that encourage active living among older people and promote healthy aging in Malaysia.",

We extend the Andersen model by including proxies for the relative attractiveness of community living compared to institutional care. Using longitudinal data on long-term care use in the Netherlands from 1996 to 2012, we examine to what extent a decline in institutional care is associated with changes in perceived attractiveness of institutional LTC care compared to community living.With a Blinder\u2013Oaxaca decomposition regression, we decomposed the difference in admission to LTC institutions between the period 1996\u20131999 and 2009\u20132012 into a part that accounts for differences in predictors of the Andersen model and an \u201cunexplained\u201d part, and investigate whether the perceived attractiveness of institutional care reduces the size of the unexplained part.We find that factors related to the perceived attractiveness of institutional care compared to community living explains 12.8% of the unexplained negative time trend in admission rates over the total period (1996\u20132012), and 19.1\u201319.2% over shorter time frames.Our results show that changes in the perceived attractiveness of institutional LTC may explain part of the decline in demand for institutional care.

There are many evidences certificated that obesity is associated with disability in developed countries. However, few studies pay attention to relationship between them in developing countries. Furthermore, it is also unknown whether the association is similar among the oldest-old in rural and urban areas. The purpose of this study is to explore rural-urban differences in the association between disability and BMI among the oldest-old in China.4076 seniors (80+) were included from the 2014 wave of Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Study. Disability, body mass index and other information including socio-demographic variables, health behavior conditions and health status were collected. Logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the association.Of 4076 respondents, 1817 (44.6%) were urban elderly. Overall, 26.6% of the participants had disability, and 31.8% for urban, 22.4% for rural. After controlling for other variables, the significant association between BMI and disability was found for urban oldest seniors, but not for rural ones. Age, living arrangement, Non-communicable disease and annual physical examination were important determinants related to disability.The association between BMI and disability differed according to residence. Both overweight and underweight were red flags of disability among Chines seniors (80+) in urban areas. Therefore, proper weight management is important for preventing disability among urban oldest-old. Additionally, annual physical examination, prevention and control of chronic diseases should be recommended to all of the oldest-old.",

Participants were diagnosed according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. Cervical spine degeneration and head and neck postures were identified using the lateral cephalogram. Myofascial trigger points (TrPs) were evaluated in the temporalis, masseter, trapezius, sternocleidomastoid, sub-occipitalis, and splenius capitis muscles. Relationships among number of TrPs, head postures, and cervical degeneration were investigated using repeated-measure analysis of variance and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient.The cerTMD showed higher number of active TrPs in the masticatory and cervical muscles, greater forward head posture, and more severe degenerative changes in the cervical spine than mTMD did. The degenerative changes in each level of the cervical spine had complex interactions with head postures. Cervical degeneration, particularly at level of second to third vertebra appeared to be linked to the development of active TrPs in the masticatory and cervical muscles.The results of this study demonstrated that degenerative changes in the cervical spine were related to altered head postures and the development of active TrPs in the craniocervical musculature in elderly with myofascial TMD.",

The National Health Survey (PNS in Portuguese) data makes it possible.This study aimed to construct a frailty index (FI) of the elderly Brazilian population using the PNS data, in order to compare it with the index of other population and to measure its association with social factors.A set of the PNS variables was selected to carry out the index, taking into account criteria identified in the literature. The FI score was categorized as: non-frail (FI\u2009\u2265\u20090.10); vulnerable (0.10\u2009<\u2009FI\u2009\u2265\u20090.21); frail (0.21\u2009<\u2009FI\u2009\u2265\u20090.45); and most frail (FI\u2009>\u20090.45). A logistic regression model was adjusted to measure the association of the FI with some risk factors and social factors.The Brazilian FI, calculated with 26 variables, presented a mean score of 0.13 and the best was a gamma distribution. Of the individuals, 53.9% were non-frail, 30.1% vulnerable, 13.6% frail and 2.5% most frail. The variables that significantly distinguished each level of the frailty were: self-perceived health status; instrumental activities of daily living (IADL); and difficulty in hearing, seeing and concentrating. Additionally, socio-demographic and sedentary lifestyle were identified as risk factors.The proposed index showed a similar distribution to the ones observed in the literature and it is associated with social factors.

Life-space mobility (LSM) was evaluated by the Life-Space Assessment in Persons with Cognitive Impairment (LSA-CI). Bivariate analyses and multivariate regression analyses were used to investigate associations between LSM and physical, cognitive, psychosocial, environmental, financial and demographic characteristics, and physical activity behavior.LSM in 118 older, multimorbid participants (age: 82.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.0 years) with cognitive impairment (MMSE score: 23.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4 points) was substantially limited, depending on availability of personal support and equipment. More than 30% of participants were confined to the neighborhood and half of all patients could not leave the bedroom without equipment or assistance. Motor performance, social activities, physical activity, and gender were identified as independent determinants of LSM and explained 42.4% (adjusted R\u00b2) of the LSA-CI variance in the regression model.The study documents the highly restricted LSM in older persons with CI following geriatric rehabilitation. The identified modifiable determinants of LSM show potential for future interventions to increase LSM in such a vulnerable population at high risk for restrictions in LSM by targeting motor performance, social activities, and physical activity. A gender-specific approach may help to address more advanced restrictions in women.",

However, the most adequate oral anticoagulant, attending to its relative efficacy and safety, remains unclear.Methods: We searched for phase III randomized controlled trials (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, SciELO collection and Web of Science) comparing novel non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in the elderly population (\u226575 years-old) in atrial fibrillation (AF). Risk ratios (RR) were calculated using a random effects model. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed in statistically significant results to evaluate whether cumulative sample size was powered.Results: Four trials rendered data about elderly (\u226575 years-old) and younger patients (<75 years-old) with AF. NOACs demonstrated a 30% significant risk reduction (RR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.80) in elderly patients compared to VKA, without heterogeneity across studies (I2\u2009=\u20090%). The TSA showed that cumulative evidence of this subgroup exceeded the minimum information size required for the risk reduction. In younger patients, VKA and NOACs shared a similar risk of stroke and systemic embolism (RR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.79 to 1.18). Regarding major bleeding risk in the elderly, the overall comparative risk of NOACs was not different from VKA (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.16; I2\u2009=\u200986%).Conclusions: NOACs reduce significantly the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in elderly patients without increasing major bleeding events.

In the multivariable analysis, patients who were initiated on oxybutynin extended-released (ER), tolterodine, trospium, darifenacin, solifenacin, and fesoterodine were significantly less likely to be discontinued therapy compared to oxybutynin IR (p\u2009<\u20090.001).After one year of antimuscarinic initiation, only 14% of older adult patients continuously utilized their initial antimuscarinic therapy suggesting a need for clinical interventions to improve continual use of antimuscarinics.",

Data for older adults (78 years and above) from the Health and Retirement Study (N\u2009=\u20091680) were used to explore meaningful subtypes of cognitive function and transitions patterns between those profiles across times. Age, gender, levels of education and nursing home were incorporated as covariates to explore the association between these variables and cognitive function transition pattern. Three cognitive function subgroups (Normal Cognitive Function, Fluid Intelligence Impairment and Cognitive Impairment) were identified. Individuals in Normal Cognitive Function status had a high probability to convert to the Fluid Intelligence Impairment status whereas the Cognitive Impairment status appeared a predominant tendency for stability. Increasing age played a significant role in fluid intelligence impairment and cognitive impairment process. Female and individuals with nursing home might be at higher risk of subsequent fluid intelligence impairment, while higher education did not protect against fluid intelligence impairment. These findings highlighted the usefulness to adopt a person-centered approach rather than a variable-centered approach, suggesting directions for future research and tailored interventions approaches to older adults with particular characteristics.",

Recent advances suggest that the aetiology of multimorbidity includes a life-long process. The purpose of this study was to determine the association between childhood adversity and multimorbidity in community-dwelling older adults, and to investigate variation in participants born immediately before, during and at the end of the Second World War.Participants were 4731 community-dwelling older adults who enrolled in the Lausanne cohort 65+ study (Switzerland) at age 65\u201370 years in 2004/2009/2014. A baseline questionnaire provided several indicators of childhood adversity including premature birth, food restrictions, child labour, family economic environment, serious illness/accident, and stressful life events. Multimorbidity at age 67\u201372 years was defined as \u22652 active chronic diseases at the 2-year follow-up questionnaire.All childhood adversity indicators except premature birth were significantly associated with multimorbidity. Odds ratio (OR) ranged from 1.23 (P\u2009=\u20090.034) for poor family economic environment to 1.74 (P\u2009<\u20090.001) for stressful life events. In a multivariable model adjusted for socioeconomic status, health behaviours and stressful life events in adulthood (>16 years), a history of serious illness/accident (OR\u2009=\u20091.45; P\u2009<\u20090.001) and stressful life events (OR\u2009=\u20091.42; P\u2009=\u20090.001) in childhood remained significantly associated with multimorbidity. Comparisons between cohorts indicated substantial variations in the prevalence of childhood adversity indicators but similar associations with multimorbidity.There was an independent association between childhood adversity and multimorbidity after age 65. This study encourages a comprehensive life-course perspective to better understand and potentially prevent multimorbidity.",

This study aimed to assess anxiety, depression and cognitive disorders among urban elderly, and explore availability of social support mechanisms and of a responsive health system to implement the national mental health programme.244 respondents were randomly selected from Berhampur city. We administered a semi-structured interview schedule to assess substance abuse, chronic morbidity, anxiety, depression and cognitive abilities. Further, in-depth interviews were conducted with 25 key informants including district officials, psychiatrists, and programme managers. We used R software and \u2018thematic framework\u2019 approach, respectively, for quantitative and qualitative data analysis. Ethical standards were complied with.About half of the respondents were economically dependent; 57.3% had moderate to severe anxiety; 46.7% had moderate to severe depression; while about 25% had severe cognitive impairments. We found association of chewing tobacco (1.34(0.28\u20132.40)) and depression (0.52(0.37\u20130.68)) with anxiety; negative perception about elderly-friendly society (1.64(0.75\u20132.53)) and physical inactivity (2.88(1.60\u20134.16)) with depression; and age (-0.11(-0.20 \u2013 -0.02)) and physical inactivity (-3.44(-5.13 \u2013 -1.74)) with cognitive disorders. Qualitative analysis revealed lack of awareness, social stigma, poor availability of trained human resources, and poor political commitment as important systemic barriers to early detection and treatment of mental ailments among the elderly.Establishing tobacco cessation centres, sensitizing community about mental health needs of elderly, incentivizing physical activity of elderly, integrating mental health with primary care, multi-skilling providers and developing a cadre of community counsellors need urgent attention of policy makers and programme implementers.",

On the admission day, serum inflammatory markers, including CRP, PCT, sTREM-1, and CPIS were analyzed. By severity, the CAP patients were subdivided into non-severe CAP group and severe CAP group. By outcome, the patients were classified into survival group and death group. The efficiency of three inflammatory markers and CPIS on predicting prognosis of pneumonia patients was then analyzed.The serum inflammatory markers and CPIS were significantly higher in CAP patients than in healthy controls. These biomarkers and CPIS were significantly higher in patients with severe CAP than in patients with non-severe CAP. Compared with patients who would survive, these markers and CPIS were significantly higher in patients who would die. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve and sensitivity were higher for serum sTREM-1 than for other indicators, while the specificity of serum PCT was the highest.Serum CRP, PCT, and sTREM-1 and CPIS determined on the admission day are effective indicators to evaluate the severity and prognosis of CAP in the elderly.

We study 1) how adult offspring\u2019s social class is associated with physical function (PF) among older adults, 2) whether geographical closeness and contact frequency with offspring modify the association, and 3) whether intergenerational social mobility of offspring is associated with PF of older adults.Data are obtained from the 2002 (n\u2009=\u2009621) and 2011 (n\u2009=\u2009931) waves of the Swedish Panel Study of Living Conditions of the Oldest Old.

The Fullerton Advance Balance (FAB) scale was used to assess balance. Mobility in terms of gait velocity, cadence, stride length, and gait stability ratio (GSR) were assessed using the 50-foot Walk test. PA was assessed through a face-to-face interview using the Baecke questionnaire, and functional fitness was assessed with Senior Fitness tests (strength, flexibility, and aerobic endurance).Balance and mobility were negatively associated with age and BMI, and positively related to PA and functional fitness. Moreover, male presented better performance in balance and mobility. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that functional fitness explained the highest amount of variance in balance and all mobility parameters (over and above age, sex, BMI, and PA). Specifically, entering functional fitness components significantly increased explained variance in FAB (+19%), gait velocity (+25%), cadence (+15%), stride length (+9%), and GSR (+ 31%). In these models, aerobic endurance consistently had the strongest contribution.Strength, flexibility, and especially aerobic endurance, over and above non-modifiable variables like age and sex, are crucial for maintaining or improving balance and mobility and, thereby, prevent falls in older people.",

Although different scales yielded vastly different frailty prevalence (SUHB 9.7%, Fried 30.4%, CFS 43.7%), predictive discrimination of poor discharge outcomes (death, poor self-reported health/quality of life, need for community services post-discharge, or reattendance to ED after the index hospitalization) for all identical final models was equivalent across all scales (AUROC 0.735 for Fried, 0.730 for CFS and 0.720 for SUHB).This study confirms that screening for frailty in older ED patients can inform prognosis and target discharge planning including community services required. The CFS was as accurate as the Fried and SUHB in predicting poor outcomes, but more practical for use in busy clinical environments with lower level of disruption. Given the limitations of objectively measuring frailty parameters, self-report and clinical judgment can reliably substitute the assessment in EDs. We propose that in a busy ED environment, frailty scores could be used as a red flag for poor follow-up outcome.",

     "abstract": "Background: To explore the associations of frailty phenotype and frailty index (FI) defined frailty and pre-frailty with mortality in a Chinese elderly population.Methods: Data of 1788 community-dwelling elders aged 70\u201384 years from the ageing arm of Rugao Longevity and Ageing Study, a prospective cohort study, were used. Frailty phenotype was defined using modified Fried\u2019s phenotype (FP) criteria and FI was constructed using 45 health deficits. Mortality was ascertained using the Death Registry of Rugao's Civil Affairs Bureau.Results: During 3-year follow-up, 149 (8.3%) of the 1788 elderly subjects died. For frailty phenotype, about 9.5% of the elderly were frail and 43% were pre-frail. For FI, frail (FI\u2009>\u20090.21) was approximately 27.5%, and pre-frail (FI: 0.1\u20130.21) was approximately 51.3%. Highest mortality was observed among frail participants defined by both FP and FI criteria (all Log Rank P\u2009<\u20090.05). Frailty defined by the frailty index was associated with a 2.31 fold (95% CI 1.16\u20134.6) risk of all-cause death compared with robust elderly. Compared with the robust elderly, not only frailty (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.31\u20133.83) defined by frailty phenotype but also pre-frailty (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03\u20132.21) was associated with risk of all-cause mortality.Conclusions: Frailty, defined by either phenotype or index, is associated with increased risks of mortality in elderly Chinese community population.",

     "abstract": "To explore whether higher socioeconomic status attenuates the effects of depressive symptoms on disability among older adults.We conducted a cross-sectional study based on 596 older adults, aged 65 and over, from a large city (Belo Horizonte) in Brazil. Disability was defined as limitation in activities such as Basic Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). Covariates were age, comorbidities, Body Mass Index (BMI) and grip strength. Statistical analyses were based on Ordinal Logistic Regression and calculated separately for men and women.Elderly women with disability and higher education levels have similar prevalence of depressive symptoms compared to those without disability (17.9% and 16.1%, respectively), but lower compared to those disabled with lower education (37.2%). A positive gradient trend was observed for depressive symptoms across disability categories among women (OR\u2009=\u20092.61; 95% CI 1.52, 4.48). However, these patterns were not observed among men.A higher level of education attenuates odds of depressive symptoms in elderly women with disability but does not eliminate it. Therefore, screening for depressive symptoms in low-educated elderly women is important in order to identify them and start early prevention care for target risk population and decrease the disability expenses for health services.",

Frailty indexes comprehensively assess a range of deficits in health, and can incorporate routinely collected data. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effect of frailty indexes on surgical and intensive care risk stratification and patient outcomes (mortality, complications, length of stay, and discharge location).A prospectively registered systematic review was performed. MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched to identify studies enrolling adult surgical or intensive care patients which used a frailty index. Included studies were those published subsequent to 1990, of any study design, which utilised a frailty index consisting of \u226530 health deficits. Primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes were complications, length of stay (LOS) and discharge location. Study and frailty index quality were critically appraised by three independent reviewers, with findings narratively described.2026 articles were screened, from which nine prospective and four retrospective cohort studies (enrolling 2539 patients) were included. Frailty prevalence ranged between 19\u201362%; frailty indexes identified patients at risk of increased death [mortality rates ranging between 1.9\u201373.1%; reported odds ratios (ORs) for death ranging between 1.76\u20133.09 for frail vs. non-frail patients], surgical complications (ORs\u2009=\u20091.67\u20134.4), increased LOS, and discharge to residential care (ORs\u2009=\u20091.9\u20133.64). The term \u201cfrailty index\u201d was found to be applied to a number of alternative measurement scales.Frail patients are at significantly increased risk in critical illness and the perioperative period. Better standardisation of frailty indexes is recommended.",

The present study was designed to evaluate the age-related acceleration of osteoporosis and CAC, as well as the relationship between BMD and CAC in Chinese elderly men.Participants included 120 men older than 60 years. CAC was measured with high-definition computerized tomography. It is a highly sensitive technique for detecting the CAC and provides the most accurate CAC scores up to date.Mean (standard deviation) age was 73 (8.5) years. For osteoporosis, there was a strongly inverse correlation between age and BMD of all scanned body parts (p\u2009<\u20090.05 for all) except the lumbar spine 1\u20134 (p\u2009>\u20090.05 for all). For CAC, there was a moderately positive correlation of agatston, volume and mass scores with age. CAC was present in 67% of participants. There was no significant correlation between all kinds of CAC scores including agatston, volume and mass scores, and BMD of all scanned body parts including lumbar spine 1\u20134, femoral neck, femoral trochanter and total femur (p\u2009>\u20090.05 for all). BMD of all these body parts had no ability to identify the CAC (p\u2009>\u20090.05 for all). Furthermore, on multiple linear regression analysis, the relationship between CAC scores and BMD remained statistically non-significant.Age constituted an important factor common for loss of BMD and development of CAC detected by HDCT, and no direct relationship was observed between osteoporosis and CAC in Chinese elderly men.",

We aimed to clarify the association between these variables in elderly individuals.Subjects were 118 healthy community-dwelling individuals aged \u226565 years (men: 37, women: 81). We measured total muscle mass, grip strength, jaw-opening force, tongue pressure, cross-sectional area (CSA) of the geniohyoid muscle, and tongue muscle thickness. The appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI) and trunk muscle mass index (TMI) were calculated based on the appendicular skeletal muscle mass and trunk muscle mass, and corrected by height squared. Multiple regression analysis was performed with jaw-opening force and tongue pressure as dependent variables and with age, sex, grip strength, ASMI, TMI, CSA of the geniohyoid muscle, and tongue muscle thickness as independent variables.Significant explanatory factors for jaw-opening force were sex (p\u2009=\u20090.002) and TMI (p\u2009=\u20090.003). Significant explanatory factors for tongue pressure were aging (p\u2009=\u20090.001), tongue muscle thickness (p\u2009=\u20090.027), and TMI (p\u2009=\u20090.033).Until now, the relationship between swallowing muscles and whole body muscle mass has been reported using ASMI as the indicator of whole body muscle mass.

We collected measures of clinical variables, self-reported symptom status, OHRQoL, nutritional status and HRQoL. The 517 participants were randomly assigned to one of two samples, to provide one training sample for estimation and one testing sample for validation. The path analysis with all observed variables was conducted based on the proposed theoretical model delineating pathways.All of the direct pathways hypothesized by the model were significant. Functional status (OHRQoL measured by OHIP-14T) mediated clinical occlusion, and symptom status mediated nutritional status (MNA) and HRQoL (WHOQOL-BREF). The model accounted for 29% of the variance in HRQoL and demonstrated a good fit with the data.This conceptual model suggests that OHRQoL, as an important mediator, links clinical conditions, symptom status, nutritional status, and overall HRQoL. Therefore, when therapeutic efforts are made to improve the outcomes for patients with oral diseases, not only can the OHRQoL be enhanced, but also the HRQoL can be improved as a result.",

After adjusting for all confounders, compared with decreased/low, the consistently high group presented the highest mortality risk (p\u2009<\u20090.001; Ptrend\u2009<\u20090.001), with hazard ratios (HR) of 3.48 at 1-year, 2.53 at 3-year, and 1.92 at 5-year follow-up, followed by the increased and decreased/high groups. Five distinct comorbidity trajectories were identified that predicted increased risk of mortality. The group with the consistently high comorbidity scores over time exhibited the highest mortality risk.",

Bivariate analyses are used to explore the relationship between the different combinations of care use and frailty.Latent Class Analysis (LCA) identified 8 different types of care use, which vary in combinations of informal and formal caregivers. Older adults who are more likely to combine care from family and care from all types of formal caregivers are more physically, psychologically and environmentally frail than expected. Older adults who are more likely to receive care only from nuclear family, or only from formal caregivers are more socially frail than expected.Older adults with a higher need for care are more likely to receive care from different types of informal and formal caregivers. High environmental frailty and low social frailty are related with the use of care from different types of informal and formal caregivers. This study confirms that informal care can act as substitute for formal care. However, this substitute relationship becomes a complementary relationship in frail older adults. Policymakers should take into account that frailty in older adults affects the use of informal and formal care.",

The self-designed elderly health assessment scale questionnaire was used. The data were analyzed through \u03c72-test and ordinal logistic regression. The results showed that the older women were higher in proportion than older men, the elderly women had lower in education, higher in divorced or widowed proportions, higher in living alone, and higher in no occupations. The proportion of elderly women suffering from chronic disease was lower than that of elderly men. The proportion of the elderly woman suffering from high cholesterol was higher, lower in high blood pressure. Elderly women were poorer than men in Physiological health, Memory and Multidimensional health status. The elderly women who had older, lower-education level, non-couples living, general employees or workers had poorer Multidimensional health status. This study demonstrated that the health status of elderly women of Nanjing, China were in a vulnerable position, especially some associated factors.

Residents in all care homes with capacity to participate were eligible for the study. Interviews explored how residents accessed NHS professionals. The Andersen model of health seeking behaviour was our analytic framework.Thirty-five participants were interviewed with an average of 4 different conditions. Expectations of their health and the effectiveness of services to mitigate their problems were low. Enabling factors were the use of intermediaries (usually staff, but also relatives) to seek access. Residents expected that care home staff would monitor changes in their health and seek appropriate help unprompted.Care home residents may normalise their health care needs and frame services as unable to remediate these which may combine to disincline older care home residents to seek care. Care access was enabled using intermediaries -either staff or relatives-and the expectation that staff would proactively seek care when they observed new/changed needs. Residents may over-estimate the health-related knowledge of care home staff and their ability to initiate referrals to NHS professionals.",

The aim of this study was to explore the process of establishing a shared care plan from the perspective of elderly people and their next of kin. Data were collected via 12 semi-structured interviews with 12 older persons targeted in joint care planning and 11 next of kin, either alone or together. The analysis was conducted using content analysis. The results reflect the process of establishing a shared care plan in the three categories; Preparation, Content and Results with belonging sub-categories. Preparation showed that the possibility to influence the preparation of the joint care plan meeting was sometimes limited and the purpose was not always clear. The Content category showed that the meeting was sometimes experienced as an unstructured, general conversation or focused on practical matters. And Results of the process were shown to be successful in terms of having positive effects or fulfilling needs, but also sometimes as being pointless. Thus, the results show that the process of establishing a shared care plan is somewhat unclear to the older person and their next of kin and that they are rarely involved in the decisions regarding when and if a shared care plan is needed. If joint care planning is expected to serve as a tool to accomplish a more person-centred care, then the person must be regarded as an equal partner all throughout the decision-making and planning process.",

The stages of sarcopenia were classified according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People. Volunteers were classified into four groups as follows: nonsarcopenia, presarcopenia, sarcopenia, and severe sarcopenia. Participants were tracked by phone calls for ascertainment of falls during a follow-up period of 18 months. Cox proportional regressions were conducted. A total of 195 women were followed over the 18-month period. Proportions of each sarcopenia stage were 6.7%, 13.8%, and 12.8% for presarcopenia, sarcopenia, and severe sarcopenia, respectively. The proportion of fallers progressively increased according to the severity of sarcopenia, with 15.4%, 40.7%, and 72% for presarcopenia, sarcopenia, and severe sarcopenia, respectively (X2\u202f=\u202f30.637; p\u202f<\u202f0.001). Severe sarcopenia was consistently associated with a higher risk of falls (hazard ratio: 3.843; 95% CI: 1.816\u20138.131), even after adjustments for age, body mass index, physical activity level, regular use of four or more medications, reduced peripheral sensation, presence of two or more chronic diseases, and history of lower-limbs pain. It is concluded that severe sarcopenia is independently associated with higher incidence of falls in older women.

A cross-sectional survey was conducted from May to July 2015 in Liaoning Province, China. 1050 community residents aged \u226560 years were ultimately chosen to participate. The Chinese version of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI), the Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale(CES-D),the Chinese version Perceived Stress Scale(CPSS), and the Sense of Coherence Scale (SOC) were used to estimate sleep quality, late-life depression, perceived stress, and sense of coherence (SOC) respectively. Pearson\u2019s correlations and the PROCESS macro were applied to analyze the data. The results showed that perceived stress partially mediated the association between poor sleep quality and depression symptoms (35% proportion mediated). In addition, the effect of poor sleep quality and the effect of perceived stress on late-life depression was moderated by SOC.The current findings indicates that the impact of poor sleep quality on late-life depression through perceived stress can be buffered when the elderly individuals have a high SOC. Interventions should therefore target individuals who are classified as poor sleepers but only have a lower SOC score. However, longitudinal studies should be conducted in future to substantiate these findings. Importantly, this research provides a useful theoretical and methodological approach for prevention of depression among the elderly in urban China.",

     "abstract": "Social exclusion (SE) is a process that limits participation in society across life domains, and is associated with poor quality of life. Neighbourhood exclusion has been identified as particularly important for older adults. This paper examines the association between SE and well-being in older adults from urban and rural areas, focusing on neighbourhood exclusion.Using a cross-sectional survey design with a stratified sampling frame, participants (aged 65+) from rural (n\u2009=\u2009628) and urban (n\u2009=\u2009627) areas of Barnsley, United Kingdom, completed a questionnaire containing indicators of five SE domains: civic activity, material resources, social relationships, services and neighbourhood. Sequential multiple regression models were developed for 1) total sample; 2) rural areas; and 3) urban areas, with well-being regressed on SE indicators after controlling for self-reported health.SE indicators explained 13.4% of the variance in well-being in the total sample (of which neighbourhood exclusion explained 1.2%); corresponding figures for the rural model were 13.8% (3.8%) and for the urban model 18.0% (1.7%); the addition of neighbourhood exclusion significantly improved all three models. Five SE indicators were significant in the rural model, compared with seven in the urban model, with four common to both.Neighbourhood exclusion explained more variance in well-being in rural than urban areas, whereas exclusion from services explained more variance in urban than rural areas. Area characteristics and the role of neighbourhood should be considered in policy initiatives to reduce SE and promote well-being.",

Six months after SSS, the global health status/QOL had recovered. In both groups, global health status/QOL was related to role and social functioning. Among participants aged <60 years, global health status/QOL was significantly related to emotional functioning, which is related to future perspective.

Although the association between sarcopenia and a decrease in masticatory function has been reported, the mechanism underlying this association has not been widely reported. Therefore, in order to elucidate the relationship between sarcopenia and masticatory function, we examined whether the masseter muscle thickness (MMT), which is a factor influencing masticatory function, in community-dwelling elders is associated with the appendicular skeletal muscle index (SMI), a diagnostic criterion for sarcopenia.MMT was measured in 774 community-dwelling elders aged 65 years or older at resting state via ultrasonography, and SMI was measured with the bioelectrical impedance method. The relationships were investigated by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age and sex, SMI, and oral-related items were performed to determine the association between these factors.There was a significant correlation between the MMT and the SMI. The multiple regression analysis indicated that SMI was significantly associated with a decrease in MMT.The reduction in whole-body skeletal muscle mass in sarcopenia may be involved in the reduction in MMT.

Results indicated that the scores of housebound status were positively correlated with the MMSE scores. Being housebound correlated negatively with MMSE scores. Housebound status and three dimensions of CES-D-R (i.e. negative affect, positive affect, and interpersonal problems) were deemed as significant predictors of cognitive function among rural elders. The effect of housebound status on cognitive function was fully mediated by depression.Not all subscales of CES-D-R can affect MMSE scores among rural elders.

In the elderly group, all measurements declined with age more sharply in men (HGS: r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.56, TP: r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.63, JOF: r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.13) than in women (HGS: r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.38, TP: r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.49, JOF: r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.003). TP declined more steeply than did JOF. Thus, the age related-decline in TP was similar to that of the HGS, but not the JOF. The results reveal that different patterns exist in the age-related decline in swallowing muscle strength, and suggest that maintenance of JOF might contribute to safe swallowing in healthy elderly individuals.",

Relevant data, including indicators of risk of bias, were extracted.Nine studies were reviewed. Reminiscence therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy are viable group interventions for geriatric depression, and were significantly superior to most controls. Conclusions about the long-term effects were unclear. Significant improvements were obtained for different intervention durations and facilitators, and with participants of different nationalities and age. Most studies recruited participants from the community, which limited generalizability. Group therapy also resulted in improvements in other psychological variables.Group therapy can significantly improve geriatric depression. Improvements were found across a variety of settings, protocols, participant characteristics, and for several psychological domains.",

In a longitudinal study of 112 community-dwelling adults (age 50\u201371\u202fyears at study entry), we used a machine learning approach to evaluate the relative strength of 52 variables in association with WML burden. Variables included socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health indices\u2014as well as multiple cognitive abilities (modeled as latent constructs using factor analysis)\u2014repeatedly measured at three- to six-year intervals. Greater chronological age, symptoms of cardiovascular disease, and processing speed declines were most strongly linked to elevated WML burden (accounting for \u223c49% of variability in WML). Whereas frontal lobe WML burden was associated both with elevated cardiovascular symptoms and declines in processing speed, temporal lobe WML burden was only significantly associated with declines in processing speed. These latter outcomes suggest that age-related WML-cognition associations may be etiologically heterogeneous across fronto-temporal cerebral regions.",

We defined functional disability as receiving certification for long-term care insurance in Japan, and frequent community activity as engaging in community activity more than once a month. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for frequent community activity based on functional disability among partners. We also conducted additional analyses using three types of community activities (neighborhood associations; sports, exercise, or a hobby; and volunteering for nonprofit organizations) as outcomes.Multivariate adjusted analysis showed that the OR (95% CI) for frequent community activity was 0.70 (0.54\u20130.89, P\u202f<\u202f0.01) among those whose partners had functional disabilities, compared with those whose partners did not have functional disabilities. This finding remained true even for different types of community activities such as neighborhood activities, sports, exercises, hobbies, and volunteering for nonprofit organizations.In this cross-sectional study of an elderly Japanese population, participants whose partners had functional disabilities were less likely to participate in community activity. We conclude that enhancement of support systems is important to promote participation in community activity, not only for patients with disability but their partners as well.",

This study investigated the role of physical and cognitive function with regard to road traffic injury in senior drivers.A community survey was carried out among people aged 60 years and older in the villages representing four regions of Thailand. Face-to-face interviews and anthropometric measurements were used to gather data including individual characteristics, medical history, risk behaviors, cognitive function and traffic injury within the last 12 months. Associations between risk factors and injury were assessed by the chi-square tests, and comparison of the cognitive function score between the injury and non-injury groups was identified using the independent t-test.A total of 314 completed questionnaires were used for analysis. Ten percent of respondents had experienced a road traffic injury in the last 12 months. Analysis revealed that level of cognitive function, smoking behavior and been diagnosed with arthritis were associated with road traffic injury incidence in senior drivers (p-value < 0.05).Results revealed the potential need for strategies to increase road traffic safety in senior drivers. Special protection should be prioritized for the elderly with physical and cognitive impairment.",

Self-perceptions of aging were considered as a moderator of the effects of threat. Overall, the effects of threat on physical performance were mostly not significant across tasks. However, threat condition influenced older adults' mental subjective age after they had performed the physical tests; people in the high-threat condition felt closer to their chronological age. Threat also influenced participants' physical subjective age, and this effect was moderated by self-perceptions of aging. More precisely, participants in the high-threat condition felt 7% physically older than their chronological age when they had more negative self-perceptions, while participants in the low-threat condition felt 13% younger. No differences emerged for participants who had more positive self-perceptions. The present findings suggest that performing physical tests under stereotype threat might worsen older people\u2019s subjective experience of their own aging by making them feel older.",

This study aims to evaluate the prevalence and factors related to polypharmacy in older adults across 17 European countries, plus Israel.In this cross-sectional analysis, we used data from participants aged 65 or more years from Wave 6 of the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) database. Polypharmacy was defined as the concurrent use of five or more medications. Age, gender, education, physical inactivity, number of limitations with activities of daily living, network satisfaction, quality of life, depression, number of chronic diseases and difficulty taking medication variables were found to be associated with polypharmacy.Our results showed a prevalence of polypharmacy ranging from 26.3 to 39.9%. Switzerland, Croatia and Slovenia were the countries with the lowest prevalence, whereas Portugal, Israel and the Czech Republic were the countries where the prevalence of polypharmacy was the highest. Age, gender, number of limitations with activities of daily living, number of chronic diseases, quality of life, depression, physical inactivity, network satisfaction, difficulty in taking medications, years of education and shortage of money were significant variables associated with polypharmacy.Polypharmacy is a highly prevalent condition in the elderly population. Identification of variables associated with polypharmacy, such as those identified in this study, is important to identify and monitor elderly groups, which are most vulnerable to polypharmacy.",

They were made of people who applied to LTCI program at least once since July 2008, and their hospital utilization records since 2002 were observed. Estimates of length of hospital stay (LOS) after the introduction of LTCI program were calculated using a segmented regression analysis. Although average LOS in hospitals implementation was lower pre-implementation period than post-implementation (16.865\u202fdays, SD: 4.864; 26.078\u202fdays, SD: 2.215, respectively, p\u202f<\u202f.0001), a decreasing trend was observed along the post-implementation period. The estimate for baseline trend, which reflect a trend in LOS before LTCI implementation, was 0.219\u202fdays (p\u202f<\u202f.0001). The estimate for Level change after intervention which is only indicated as the change of LOS was 2.821\u202fdays at the time of LTCI implementation, and was statistically significant (p\u202f<\u202f.0001). The estimate for Trend change after intervention, reflecting the trend in LOS after LTCI implementation, was \u22120.313, indicating a decreasing trend in LOS of \u22120.094\u202fdays (p\u202f=\u202f0.0055), compared with the baseline trend.

In this study, 310 French-speaking older adults (56 geriatric patients and 254 community-dwelling older adults) completed the M-FES Fr. Among the community-dwelling older adults, 67 fallers and 70 non-fallers were also asked to complete questionnaires related to variables such as health, fear of falling, and physical activity levels.A two-factor solution (indoor vs outdoor activities) was suggested, which accounted for 68.1% of the total variance. Reliability estimates for both factors were good (Cronbach \u03b1 > 0.94, ICC\u202f>\u202f.93). Significant differences between geriatric patients and community-dwelling older adults and between fallers and non-fallers were highlighted. Furthermore, the M-FES Fr scores were significantly linked to various risk factors for falling.The M-FES Fr has psychometric properties which are similar to those found in the original version, including reliability and validity. This questionnaire will enable French-speaking researchers and health professionals to work with the same concepts as those used in other languages. Notably, the M-FES Fr could be used in the development and evaluation of intervention strategies in the prevention of falls.",

To close this gap, this study examined the separate and combined effects of self-reported vision and hearing impairment for depressive symptoms in a sample of oldest-old individuals, controlling for other mental health risks (e.g., functional disability, health interference, and loneliness).Centenarians and near-centenarians (N\u2009=\u2009119; average age\u2009=\u200999) were recruited from the community and geriatric healthcare organizations. In-person interviews were conducted at participants\u2019 place of residence.Vision impairment and its interaction with hearing impairment as well as functional disability, health interference with desired activities, and loneliness were significant predictors of depressive symptoms in hierarchical regression analyses. Hearing impairment alone was not associated with depressive symptoms, but follow-up analyses clarifying the interaction effect showed that individuals with poor vision had the highest levels of depressive symptoms, if they had a concurrent hearing impairment. Thus, a concurrent presence of poor vision and poor hearing resulted in an increased vulnerability for depressive symptoms.Given that a majority of oldest-old has sensory impairments which can result in mental health issues, it is important to facilitate this population\u2019s access to vision and audiological treatment and rehabilitation.",

Therefore, this study aimed to assess whether protective factors, derived from a systematic literature review, moderate the relationship between multidimensional frailty and ADL dependency, and whether this differs across age groups.A longitudinal study with a follow\u2013up after 24 months was conducted among 1027 community-dwelling people aged \u226565 years. Multidimensional frailty was measured with the Tilburg Frailty Indicator, and ADL dependency with the ADL subscale from the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale. Other measures included socio-demographic characteristics and seven protective factors against ADL dependency, such as physical activity and non-smoking. Logistic regression analyses with interaction terms were conducted.Frail older people had a twofold risk of developing ADL dependency after 24 months in comparison to non-frail older people (OR\u202f=\u202f2.12, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.45\u20133.00).

Moreover, in a collectivist community like the Philippines, the family, community, and Transcendent are inseparable in promoting quality of life. This study developed and tested a model of quality of life (QoL) among chronically-ill, community-dwelling older adults.From August to November 2017, a cross-sectional study of 304 chronically-ill, community-dwelling older adults from selected rural communities in the Philippines was conducted. Respondents completed a five-part survey packet composed of the socio-demographic profile, modified Older People\u2019s Quality of Life, Spirituality Assessment Scale, Hypertension Self-Care Profile, and Diabetes Self-Management Questionnaire.Socio-demographics, community satisfaction, spirituality, and disease self-management accounted 29.00% of QoL, generating a good model (\u03c72/df\u202f=\u202f1.44, RMSEA\u202f=\u202f0.038, and PNFI\u202f=\u202f0.64). Spirituality (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.34, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) was the strongest predictor of QoL, while community satisfaction had both direct (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.26, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and indirect (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.08, p\u202f<\u202f0.01) effects. Disease self-management directly (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f0.15, p\u202f=\u202f0.016) influenced QoL. In contrast, longer chronicity and larger family size impair QoL.Quality of life among chronically-ill, community-dwelling older adults is a multi-faceted health construct influenced by socio-demographics, disease self-management, community satisfaction, and spirituality. The presented model highlights the positive effect of disease self-management, community satisfaction, and spirituality which can be utilized in developing appropriate community-based geriatric strategies, policies, and programs. Further, forming collaborative groups with socially-active community elderly and community-based self-care programs can be ventured to address the needs of older adults.",

Medicare as primary payer was associated with greater odds of NH admission. Admission from nursing facilities substantially increased the odds of NH admission upon hospital discharge. Patients discharged with diagnoses of stroke, lower-limb fractures, and a chronic ulcer, as well as those with a longer length-of-stay (> 5 days) experienced increased odds of NH admission. Being discharged from a larger hospital (with >200 beds) decreased the odds for NH admission; as did being discharged from a government-owned hospital.Older Black patients with mental health disorder experienced significantly greater odds of NH admission after adjusting for other factors. Public policy initiatives are needed to address the specific needs in the vulnerable population to avoid unwanted NH admission.",

The Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to test the statistical significance of differences between age groups and eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. This article shows mathematical equations, which quantitatively express increases in body sway and its velocity with age.

     "abstract": "Given the social burden and significant cost of dementia care in Australia, finding evidence-based approaches that improve outcomes, maintain independence, and reduce the impact on patients and families is essential. Finding effective ways to train and assist the healthcare staff who support these individuals is also critical, as they are considered to be at risk of workplace stress, burnout, and other psychological disturbances which negatively affects standards of care. The current paper describes a protocol for evaluating the effects of a Montessori-based approach to dementia care, in non-residential respite centres. An 18 month prospective observational, cohort controlled design is suggested that will compare participants from a community respite service that has undergone a Montessori-based workplace culture change and those from a service that provides a person-centred \u2018care as usual\u2019 approach. To achieve this, the protocol includes the assessment of participants across multiple variables on a monthly basis including the cognitive, behavioural, and emotional functioning of clients with dementia, levels of caregiver burden experienced by informal carers, and burnout, compassion satisfaction and workplace engagement among respite staff. The protocol also employs a qualitative evaluation of program fidelity. This approach will provide further insight into the potential benefits of early intervention with Montessori approaches for persons living with dementia in the community, their caregivers, and the staff and volunteers who assist them.",

Process measures included geriatric-focused care practices, such as early mobilization, safety precautions, delirium management, use of potentially inappropriate medications and documentation of advanced directives as well as discharge disposition.Of the 10,529 patients, 2949 (28.0%) were cared for by staff hospitalists, 7181 (68.2%) by non-staff hospitalists and 399 (3.79%) by geriatrician-hospitalists. Patients cared for by geriatrician-hospitalists were significantly older with more comorbidities than those admitted to staff and non-staff hospitalists (average age: 86.3, 79.7, and 80.3, respectively, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001; Charlson Comorbidity Index: 7.46, 7.01, and 7.17, respectively, p\u202f=\u202f0.0005). Multivariate analysis showed no difference in LOS, 30-day readmissions, and discharge disposition. In terms of care practices, significant differences were found for the following: time to PT (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), duration of indwelling bladder catheters (p\u202f=\u202f0.018), documentation of Do-Not-Resuscitate (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), benzodiazepine use (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and anticholinergics (p\u202f=\u202f0.0029), respectively.As the population continues to age at unprecedented rates and hospitals struggle to meet the demands and expectations, geriatrician-hospitalists may improve care practices important for older adult care management.",

The purpose of this study is to compare 32 healthy older adults, 31 amnestic mild cognitively impaired (aMCI) adults, and 32 patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in order to determine whether there are differences in their psychological wellbeing, resilience, and coping strategies. Unifactorial MANOVAS and ANOVAS were performed to analyze the between-group differences. The results reveal that the AD group showed lower levels of resilience and orientation toward problem-solving and greater use of religious strategies. In addition, they had significantly lower wellbeing scores than the other groups. The worsening of the pathology impedes the capacity for adaptation and resilience and the application of strategies oriented toward the problem, and it increases the application of strategies based on magical thinking. Moreover, it also produces a reduction in wellbeing.",

Latent Class Analyses (LCAs) were estimated. The classes obtained were compared on markers of successful aging.Three latent classes were deemed optimal. Significant differences for several markers of successful aging were found.A main conclusion derived from the results is that not all old people do exercise for the same motives, and the class of motives you are in had an impact/relation on markers of successful aging. Motives related to internal rather than external pressures should be promoted in the old age.",

The overall incidence of falls was high (40.2%), and falls risk awareness scores reduced with age. The older adults with greater falls risk awareness and non-fallers presented better scores in all functional tests and physical activity level (P\u202f<\u202f.05). Functional tests and falls risk awareness differed among age groups and differed between fallers and non-fallers, irrespective of age group (P\u202f<\u202f.05).

Similarly, the age-adjusted incidence of hip fracture increased until 1997 but declined thereafter. The decline was especially clear in women whose age-adjusted incidence was 537.9 (per 100,000 persons) in 1997 but only 344.1 in 2016. In men, the corresponding incidence was 256.5 in 1997 and 194.7 in 2016. With the current 2016 incidence rates, the number of hip fractures in Finland will increase by 44% by the year 2030 due to the sharp growth of the population at risk. The only way to limit the rise is to have a further decline in fracture incidence in 2016\u20132030.The decline in the incidence of hip fracture in Finland has continued through the entire new millennium. Despite this we have to effectively continue implementation of the fracture prevention efforts, because our elderly population will grow rapidly in the near future.",

Whereas it had no direct effect, generativity had an indirect effect on fear of death: It was associated with increased ego integrity which, in turn, was associated with reduced fear of death. This pattern was verified for the three cultural groups via structural equation modeling. Results suggest that generativity is not sufficient in coming to terms with one\u2019s mortality. Instead, generativity contributes to ego integrity which then helps to face death relatively unafraid.",

In spite of these, the process by which successful aging is experienced by incarcerated older women remains to be a blank spot in research.This study purports to describe the process by which incarcerated older Filipino women experience successful aging.Strauss and Corbin's grounded theory design was employed. Semistructured interviews were conducted among 15 purposively selected incarcerated older Filipino from a Philippine penal institution exclusive for women. Further, data gathered was reduced to field text and was analyzed through open, axial and selective coding. Finally, truthfulness and trustworthiness of the findings were established through member checking.The study generated \u201cThe Road to Success Model\u201d. Interestingly, five phases relative to successful aging emerged, namely: Struggling, Remotivating, Reforming, Reintegrating and Sustaining. These phases describe how select incarcerated older Filipino women undergo transformation towards successful aging. Similar to a road, each phase is considered a station where one must pass through in order to get to the destination.Findings of the study serve as an impetus for structural and procedural changes in prison, with a view to providing an environment conducive to successful aging and appropriate recognition to the older prisoner's efforts to achieve successful aging.",

Hierarchical linear modeling statistical techniques were used to examine the effects of gait quality and balance ability (using the Tinetti Gait and Balance Test) and cognitive status (using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) on walking activity (distance, sustained distance, sustained speed). The latter were measured objectively and continuously by a real-time locating system (RTLS).A one-point increase in balance ability was associated with an 8% increase in sustained walking distance (p\u202f=\u202f0.03) and a 4% increase in sustained gait speed (p\u202f=\u202f0.00).

Hospitalization rates increased 4.7 times throughout the study period. Pneumonia and urinary tract infections were the most frequent main diagnoses, while dementia itself was the cause of admission in a minority (6.8%) of cases. Cerebrovascular disease, diabetes without chronic complications, and congestive heart failure were the most prevalent comorbidities; 5.9% of patients with dementia admitted to hospital underwent a surgical procedure, orthopedic surgeries being the most frequent. The median length of hospital stay was 8.0\u202fdays, and in-hospital mortality rate was 16.1%.Dementia patients represent a significant amount of hospital admissions. Most leading causes of hospital admissions are preventable if timely diagnosed and could be effectively managed in the outpatient setting. These findings may be useful for healthcare resource planning and allocation. Further research should drive evidence-based reorganization of health care systems.",

This study aimed to explore how older adults responded to challenges after the earthquake in Iran.This study was based on qualitative analysis. Data were collected through in-depth and semi-structured interviews. 29 participants including 18 older adult survivors of the earthquake-stricken areas, four lay caregivers, and three health professionals in disasters, one social worker, two relief worker and one disaster psychologist were interviewed. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. The transcribed texts were analyzed using inductive qualitative content analysis recommended by Graneheim and Lundman (2004).The study explored two main categories regarding older adults\u2019 responses to challenges after the earthquake: adaptive and maladaptive responses. Adaptive response has been developed by four factors including; religious coping, sharing feelings and information, coping with new activities, roles and place. Also, maladaptive response was included; the lack of motivation to search for relief supplies, undue dependency, and decrease of social activities.Service providers are recommended to identify the patterns of vulnerability and cultural sensitivities in older adults\u2019 responses to manage the negative consequences of disasters on older adults. Furthermore, older adults can make a substantial contribution in recovery programs based on the adaptive responses, such as helping in the rescue efforts and psychological support from family and community after disasters.",

In addition, the association between the number of chronic diseases and a positive gap varied by sex and living area. Our results suggest that a positive gap between GSRH and ASRH that indicates an overestimated age-comparative health, was associated with the number of chronic diseases. Female or urban-living people had stronger associations. Further research is needed to understand how the gap between GSRH and ASRH could be an alternative measure of SRH and a predictor of major health outcomes.",

However, the effects of PA as an adjunct to RT on frailty status remains unclear; therefore, we clarified the effect of a PA intervention with feedback, as an adjunct to resistance strength training, on the physical and mental outcomes of frail older adults.We employed a randomized controlled trial. Community-dwelling frail older adults in Japan were recruited to participate. Forty-one participants (mean age 81.5) were randomly assigned to engage in a resistance training with PA (RPA group) or RT group for six months. Frailty status and frailty scores, which were measured according to the Cardiovascular Health Study criteria\u2014muscle strength, mobility, instrumental activities of daily living, and health-related quality of life\u2014were assessed.Participants in the RPA group exhibited a significant increase in light-intensity PA, the number of steps taken daily (p\u202f<\u202f0.05), and lower-limb muscle strength (p\u202f<\u202f0.05) and a significant decrease in frailty scores. However, pre- and postintervention frailty status, instrumental activities of daily living, and health-related quality of life did not differ significantly.Implementation of a PA intervention as an adjunct to RT is feasible, as it reduced frailty scores and increased lower-limb muscle strength and mobility in older adults with frailty symptoms.",

However, treatment of acute coronary syndrome in the elderly patients has its own problems that have not been thoroughly addressed in the clinical trials. Since these patients are generally fragile and have multiple co-morbidities, the course of acute coronary syndrome can frequently be complicated. Infection, which co-exists either at the initial presentation or is acquired during the hospital stay, is a condition about which there is little published data. Therefore, in our study, we wanted to assess the impact of infection on mortality in octogenarians who have acute coronary syndromeWe retrospectively analyzed the data of 174 octogenarians who had been admitted to the coronary care unit with acute coronary syndrome. All-cause mortality was defined as the primary endpoint of the study.Overall 53 octogenarian patients (30.5%) had an infection along with acute coronary syndrome. The mean duration of follow-up was 10 months (1\u201325 months). Both in-hospital and long-term mortality were higher in these patients (18.9% vs 6.6%, p\u202f=\u202f0.01; 52.8% vs 27.5%, p\u202f<\u202f0.01; respectively).

However, it remains unknown whether it might be useful in fit and frail older patients undergoing abdominal emergency surgery.Consecutive patients \u226565\u202fyears, needing emergency abdominal surgery were enrolled in this prospective study. Additionally to the SAS, the G8 screening score was used to determine the frailty status. The logistic regression analysis was conducted investigating the association between the scores and 30-day postoperative outcomes.The study sample comprised 315 older patients (165 female, 150 male) with a median age of 77 (range 65\u2013100) years old. The prevalence of frailty was 60.3%. The most frequent surgical indications were acute cholecystitis, followed by ileus, complicated diverticulitis, ulcer perforation, complication of gastric cancer and other causes. The decreasing SAS was significantly associated with the increasing likelihood of both 30-day postoperative major complications (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) and death (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) both in fit and frail older patients. Multivariate analyses have identified the G8, frailty screening test, and the SAS score as independent factors that predict postoperative adverse events. The model combining both scores increased the discriminatory ability for 30-day postoperative major morbidity and mortality.The SAS confirmed to be a simple and powerful predictor of 30-day postoperative morbidity and mortality both in fit and frail older patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery. The department allocation algorithm based of the combination of the G8 and the SAS may be considered as an option to improve the outcomes of older patients undergoing abdominal emergency surgery.",

The Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG), and grip strength (GS) exposure variables were measured. Associations were assessed using Cox regression with first unplanned readmission or death (all-causes) as the outcome. Prediction models including the three exposure variables and known risk factors were modelled using logistic regression and C-statistics.Of 1328 included patients, 50% were readmitted or died within 6 months. When adjusted for gender and age, there was an 88% higher risk of readmission or death if the TFI scores were 8\u201313 points compared to 0\u20131 points (HR 1.88, CI 1.38;2.58). Likewise, higher TUG and lower GS scores were associated with higher risk of readmission or death. The area under the curve for the prediction models ranged from 0.64 (0.60;0.68) to 0.72 (0.68;0.76).In acutely admitted older medical patients, higher frailty assessed by TFI, TUG, and GS was associated with a higher risk of readmission or death within 6 months after discharge. The performance of the prediction models was mediocre, and the models cannot stand alone as risk stratification tools in clinical practice.",

In addition, falls efficacy was demonstrated to be both a mediator and moderator variable in the linkage between locomotive function and quality of life.

Thematic analysis methods were used to analyse the dataset.Improved social interaction in the gym-based program was seen to contribute to adherence, however home-based programs were perceived as more convenient and easily integrated into daily routines. Individualized exercise prescription by a health professional with regular follow up (in person or by telephone) promoted an active practitioner-participant relationship. Health coaching combined with exercise was perceived to improve self-efficacy and assisted with the removal of intrinsic and extrinsic exercise barriers.This research presented many common and different themes in participant\u2019s motivation, capacity and opportunity in sustained adherence to a gym or home-based exercise program.

Cox proportional hazards regressions were performed to estimate the effects of dietary habits on poor self-rated health, adjusting for various individual characteristics.Compared to those who rarely/never consumed fruit, vegetable, meat, egg, and soybean-derived product, participants consuming such products almost every day were 28%, 20%, 32%, 16%, and 16% less likely to report poor self-rated health during follow-up, respectively. Compared to those who rarely/never consumed fruit, meat, fish, soybean-derived product, and tea, participants consuming such products occasionally were 12%, 24%, 11%, 15%, and 14% less likely to report poor self-rated health during follow-up, respectively. Compared to those who rarely/never consumed sugar, participants consuming sugar almost every day were 14% more likely to report poor self-rated health during follow-up. The effects of dietary habits on self-rated health to some extent differed by sex.Oldest-old Chinese could gain health benefit from regular consumption of fruit, vegetable, meat, fish, egg, soybean-derived product, and tea; whereas their sugar consumption may need to be reduced. Future research is warranted to establish the recommended daily nutrient allowances for the oldest-old adults and better address the nutritional needs of this vulnerable population.",

Individuals with communication problems (deafness, blindness or language barriers) and problems with manual dexterity were not included in the study. The EFS is composed of 11 items, with a minimum score of zero and a maximum score of 17. Initially, the scale was translated into Turkish and then back translated in order to ensure language equivalence. Six experts were consulted with regard to content validity and agreement among the experts was assessed using Kendall's W. When testing the reliability of the EFS, the scale was re-administered to 30 participants two-three weeks after the initial administration in order to determine its consistency over time and agreement between the first and second administration was analysed using the kappa statistic. Pearson's Moment Correlation Coefficient and Cronbach's Alpha were also used to establish reliability.The overall Cronbach's alpha value for the scale was 0.75. An \u201citem analysis\u201d calculated item-total correlation coefficients of between 0.12-0.65 for scale items, and the item-total correlation for item six was found to be less than 0.20. This item solicits the number of medications used by the subject, and since the number of medications used is significant in the determination of frailty it was not removed from the scale. The scale was found to be highly consistent over time (Kappa (\u03ba)\u202f=\u202fMin: 0.95, Max: 1.00)EFS indicators were found to be sufficiently reliable and valid for the Turkish population. Accordingly, it is recommended that this scale be used in determining the frailty of older individuals.",

However, little is known about its treatment options and outcomes in elderly MN patients at long term follow-up. We retrospectively enrolled patients with biopsy-proven MN between April 1990 and December 2015 from eight tertiary hospitals in Korea. Among them, we excluded patients who had secondary causes of MN and subnephrotic-range proteinuria. We evaluated the presenting features and clinical outcomes and analyzed the all-cause mortality, renal outcomes, infection, and remission with respect to age. During the median follow-up at 77.2 months, 198 younger patients (<65\u202fyears) and 133 elderly patients (\u226565 years) were enrolled. Age was an independent risk factor for all-cause mortality, renal outcome, and infection (for all P\u202f<\u202f0.05) except remission. In elderly patients, there was no significant factor associated with mortality rate. The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) was significantly associated with renal outcome and infection (renal outcome, hazard ration [HR] 0.06, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.01\u20130.36, P\u202f=\u202f0.003; infection, HR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04\u20130.94, P\u202f=\u202f0.041). Immunosuppressant therapy significantly increased renal outcome (P\u202f=\u202f0.045) and infection (P\u202f=\u202f0.029) compared with conservative therapy. In conclusion, old age is one of the clinically important predictors for MN patients. Among the treatment of elderly MN patients, only ACEI or ARB was associated with beneficial effects on renal outcome and infection. Elderly MN patients need a more tailored regimen considering their comorbidities and condition.",

Despite large numbers of such schemes for carers of people with dementia, there is little evidence for any benefits they may offer. The aim of this research was to investigate the impact of befriending and peer support on carers of people with dementia and to explore their experiences of receiving the interventions using a mixed methods approach.Nineteen carers of people with dementia were recruited from befriending and peer support services. Carers completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) and UCLA Loneliness Scale at baseline, three months and six months. Of the 16 carers who completed the quantitative phase, eight took part in depth semi-structured interviews.A statistically significant increase in perceived social support from a significant other between baseline and three months was found (Z\u202f=\u202f2.487, p\u202f=\u202f0.013). Qualitative findings showed befriending and peer support to be important sources of emotional and social support for carers, which was facilitated by the volunteers\u2019 experiential similarity.Volunteer led befriending and peer support offers carers of people with dementia emotional and social support which enables them to cope better with challenges and continue caring. This has important implications for potentially reducing breakdowns in carer mental and physical health. Future research should explore whether these finding are replicable in other locations and in more diverse populations.",

The analysis included 61,239 people with dementia and 183,477 control subjects, all 65 years and older. Control subjects were age, gender, and regionally matched in a 1:3 ratio. Negative binomial hurdle regression was used to compare differences in hospitalization for the year 2014.People with dementia had 1.49 times higher adjusted odds of being hospitalized at least once (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46\u20131.52). Among those individuals hospitalized at least once, dementia increased the number of readmissions by 18% (95% CI, 1.15\u20131.20). Dementia patients also had a 1.74 times higher odds for at least one emergency admission compared to individuals without dementia (95% CI, 1.70\u20131.78). Dementia patients' admission risk factors included having care dependency, being recently diagnosed with dementia and living outside a metropolitan region. The increased length of stay for people with dementia per year was mainly attributable to higher admission rates.Dementia patients are at higher risk for hospitalization, especially if they live outside the metropolitan region. Healthcare systems need to respond to the challenges resulting from the predicted demographic developments and increasing burden of dementia in the general population.",

It has been described as the multidimensional and dynamic condition that cannot be easily disentangled from psychosocial determinants. To date, the possible role of occupational factors on frailty development and its progression at advanced age are not yet fully understood. The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of existing evidence exploring the relationship between multiple occupational issues (e.g., employment history, workplace risk factors, organizational job characteristics) and frailty.A systematic search and revision of available literature addressing the contribution of occupational factors on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of frailty in the elderly was performed in the Pubmed, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science databases.The major weaknesses of existing literature reside in the heterogeneous operationalization of frailty and the limited description of the workplace factors. Nevertheless, an association between life-course occupational conditions and frailty was documented. In particular, intrinsically harder, manual, or blue-collar occupations emerged as possible determinants of the frailty manifestation and severity at older age.Our preliminary results do not allow extrapolating definite conclusions. Further studies are needed. However, it seems that a significant relationship exists between the life-course occupation and frailty at advanced age. From a public health and social geriatric perspective, this work may provide the basis to define future innovations for preventing frailty at elderly adopting a life-course approach.",

Our aim was to conduct a systematic comparative study of the accuracy of estimation of GFR in older people with these two formulae.We conducted a systematic search in Pubmed, EMBASE and Central databases on the validity of the CKD-EPIcr and BIS1 formulae in people aged 60 or more years. The search ranged from 2009 and 2012 for CKD-EPIcr and BIS1, respectively, until May 2017. The validity criterion for comparing the formulae was to have a P30 accuracy level equal to or greater than 80%.Of 1295 identified studies, 16 met our inclusion criteria. Out of 16 studies reporting the accuracy of the CKD-EPIcr formula, only 5 (31.3%) had P30 scores \u226580% (mean P30 was 77.1\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.711 range 55.5\u201391.7), and out of 9 studies on accuracy using the BIS1 formula, 6 (66.7%) were \u226580% (mean P30 was 83.88\u202f\u00b1\u202f9.37, range 67.0\u201395.8).Our results suggest that for the estimation of the GFR in older people, BIS1 formula may be more accurate than CKD-EPIcr.",

The Second City is a Chicago-based comedy improvisation organization that provides training in improvisation. One of their training courses, Humor Doesn\u2019t Retire, specifically teaches adults 55 and over, on improvisation. This study sought to explore the experiences of older adults enrolled in Humor Doesn\u2019t Retire, and to characterize any benefits that older adult participants perceived following participation in the comedy improvisation course. Qualitative analysis was used to identify and describe common themes that emerged in a survey of open-ended questions regarding benefits of the improvisation course on outlook and mood as well as behavior changes. Results for perceived benefits showed main themes of increased positivity, an increased sense of comfort and ease with the unexpected, a sense of self-development and self-awareness, and a feeling of acceptance by their social group. Participants reported that these changes fed into their behaviors, and resulted in enhanced problem solving abilities, greater facility in social situations, and the tangible outcome of an expanded and closer-knit social circle. As the first study in our knowledge to examine the effect of improvisation comedy on healthy older adults, this exploratory analysis has suggested that improvisation comedy may be a mechanism by which to combat several geriatric syndromes, including depression, stress, and isolation \u2212 all of which are detrimental to older adults.",

However, there are only a few studies that have examined age, period, and cohort dependent influences of SES disparities on late-life disabilities. We investigated associations between SES disparities and late-life disability based on the Age-Period-Cohort. We also investigated how macro-economic conditions unique to a period, or a cohort might explain the period or the cohort trends.Data were obtained from people aged 65 and over that responded to the Comprehensive Survey of Living Conditions, which had been conducted every three years from 1989 to 2013. SES was assessed via household income. Disability was assessed as disabilities in performing Basic Activities of Daily Living (BADL). Income disparities were evaluated by the slope index of inequality (SII) and the relative index of inequality (RII). Each Age-Period-Cohort dimension was simultaneously controlled using a model for cross-classification of random effects.Differences in BADL disabilities due to income disparities decreased with age and reversed after approximately 80 years of age. Income disparities in BADL disability changed across periods, by increasing in periods with a high unemployment rate, which started two to four years before the period. Moreover, results of using SII and RII were nearly identical.Higher mortality in elderly with lower income might be related to a reduction of income disparities in BADL disability in Japan. Furthermore, exposure to harsh economic conditions might contribute to increased disparities in BADL disability a few years later.",

Participants were categorized as: (i) No sarcopenia (normal muscle mass), (ii) Pre-sarcopenia (low muscle mass without weakness or slowness), (iii) Sarcopenia (low muscle mass AND weak grip strength and/or slow gait speed) using Asian cut-offs. Muscle quality was defined as the ratio of grip and knee extension strength to average arm and leg lean mass respectively. We measured cognitive, functional and physical (Short Physical Performance Battery, SPPB) performance; physical activity level; nutritional status; and blood biomarkers of inflammation and endocrine dysfunction.SPPB (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033) and activity level (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) were highest in the pre-sarcopenic group.

Based on previous research examining age-related changes in balance and differences between fallers and nonfallers, the purpose of this investigation was to examine age-related balance changes, as reflected in medial-lateral center of pressure (CP) velocity, in community-dwelling/independently living adults (\u226560\u00a0years) during self-selected and narrow stance testing with eyes opened and closed.Two hundred and thirty adults aged 60\u00a0yrs or older completed one 45\u00a0s trial under two stances (self-selected, narrow) and two visual conditions (eyes opened, eyes closed). Average medial-lateral CP velocity was computed from the CP data, with preliminary analysis demonstrating positive skewness and association with body height. A sway velocity index (SVI) was created by a natural logarithm transformation and dividing by body height. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the association between age, visual condition, stance, and sex with SVI.Age, visual condition, stance and sex were all demonstrated to be significant predictors of SVI, with the combination of the predictors explaining 25% of the variance in the SVI.These results confirm the balance testing protocol and SVI to be sensitive to age-related changes in balance performance. The results of this study should help future research aimed towards establishing a quick, easy to administer, and readily interpretable instrumented test for assisting with identifying potential balance impairments in older adults who have yet to demonstrate outward deficits.",

     "abstract": "Insecure attachment styles have been known to predict greater burden in caregivers of dementia patients. However, it has not been tested how filial obligation, which refers to one\u2019s sense of duty on helping elderly parents and is especially pronounced in Asian cultures, is involved in that relationship. We sought to identify whether the association between attachment style and caregiver burden differs according to the degree of filial obligation in caregivers of dementia patients. To assess filial obligation in Korean participants, a Korean filial obligation measure was developed. Ninety-eight Korean female caregivers of dementia patients reported their attachment style, filial obligation, burden, and patient behavioral symptoms. Patients\u2019 cognitive abilities, daily activity levels, and global dementia severities were obtained from hospital records. When adjusting for caregiver and patient characteristics, greater attachment anxiety predicted higher burden, corroborating literature findings. However, the association of attachment avoidance with burden was contingent on filial obligation: When obligation was high, greater avoidance associated with lower burden, which contrasts with previous negative implications of attachment insecurity. This implies a buffering role of attachment avoidance among those highly obligated. In addition, obligation positively predicted burden among those low in avoidance. This study is the first one to investigate and find conditional associations between attachment style, filial obligation, and caregiver burden. Given that filial obligation tends to be higher in caregivers of Eastern countries, this study provides quantitative evidence that the caregiving process may be different for them.",

Depression was measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Depression treatment included antidepressants use and receipt of mental health counseling or psychotherapy. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of individual characteristics and receipt of depression treatment.Current depression affected 23% of older home health services users. Less than 40% of those who screened positive for depression reported receiving depression treatment. Among those who received treatment, virtually all (99.8%) reported receiving antidepressants and only 9.5% reported receiving psychotherapy. Among older home health services users with current depression, older age and non-Hispanic black race were associated with lower odds of receiving depression treatment whereas having cognitive impairment was positively associated with receiving depression treatment.Depression affects a substantial proportion of older home health services users and is undertreated.

Recent literature contributions have investigated the causes of the emergence of desire to institutionalize (DI) who is affected by AD. This paper contributes to the topic by providing an Italy-based empirical analysis of factors correlated with DI in primary informal caregivers of patients affected by AD.Data were drawn from an original survey carried out over 2009. 171 primary informal caregivers of patients followed in two Italian outpatients AD Care Units, located in two of the major Italian cities, Naples (46.78%) and Rome (53.22%), were interviewed. The caregiver desire to institutionalize AD affected patients was observed and its heterogeneity was studied through logistic regression.DI was positively correlated with patient poor autonomy, to the housewife/househusband status of primary caregiver and to the presence of a formal caregiving. DI was also barely correlated with patient gender and with the hours of informal supervision (p\u202f<\u202f0.10). The housewife status of the primary caregiver was also positively associated with DI, while the female gender of the patient was negatively associated to it.The institutionalization of an AD-affected relative is a painful decision which is discouraged by the scarcity of adapted facilities and the need of an economical contribution in case of institutionalization in private facilities not receiving public support.",

Self-perceived uselessness was classified into four categories: high, moderate, and low frequencies plus unable to answer the question. Financial resources included six objectively- or subjectively-measured variables and two culturally-measured variables. Multinomial logistic models were employed for the purposes, taking the low frequency as the reference category and adjusting for intrapersonal correlation.Better financial resources, either objectively- or subjectively-measured, are associated with lower risk of the high and moderate frequencies of self-perceived uselessness relative to the low frequency in both urban and rural older adults. Subjectively-measured financial resources have more pronounced associations with self-perceived uselessness than objectively-measured financial resources in both urban and rural areas. Upward wealth transfer, one culturally-measured financial factor, is associated with greater relative risk of the high vs. the low frequency in urban areas, but the association is not significant in rural areas. In both urban and rural areas, the downward transfer, another culturally-measured financial factor, is associated with lower relative risk of the high frequency vs. the low frequency.The associations between financial resources and self-perceived uselessness differ between urban and rural areas. Subjectively-measured financial resources tend to be more strongly associated with self-perceived uselessness.",

Predictors in the model included: baseline physical function, baseline cognition, two physical frailty measures, age, injury severity, a comorbidity index, gender, living location, mechanism of injury, and hospital admitting service.The full model yielded an R2 of 0.45, and Life Space Assessment, Vulnerable Elders Survey, and Injury Severity were the most influential predictors. Approximated models (to encourage clinical use) yielded an R2 of 0.86. Calibration assessment (i.e., accuracy) demonstrated a mean squared error <0.003 at all 3 intercepts.A moderate statistical signal was discovered that contributed to a highly accurate clinical prediction model.

Extraversion and neuroticism were entered into the regression equation. All standardized coefficients (\u03b2) were significant (all P<0.01) in the model, and bootstrapping indicated that the mediating role of coping style was statistically significant.Coping style partially mediated the relationship between the personality and mental health of the empty-nest elderly.

Participants admitted to the Toulouse frailty day hospital, with an assessment of body composition, 70 years or older were included consecutively in the study. Low lean mass (LLM), was identified using five international operative definitions. To construct the definitions, muscle mass was assessed using Intelligent Dual Energy X-ray absorptiometry (I-DXA, LUNAR). Frailty was assessed using the Fried criteria.Data from 283 participants, mean age 82 years and 71% of women were analyzed. LLM was identified between 8.5% and 39.2% of the participants according to the different definitions. Frailty was identified in 46.6% of the sample. 9.1%\u201348.5% of the frail older people had LLM depending on the definition. The highest association between frailty and LLM was observed with the definition proposed by the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health (FNIH) Sarcopenia Project [adjusted Odds Ratio 2.64; 95% confidence interval 1.5\u20134.8].The decline in lean mass is a component of the frailty syndrome but not universally present. Indeed, LLM and frailty were associated and partly overlapped. Future research including longitudinal studies should exploit the added value of combining LLM and frailty measures in preventing disability and other negative health outcomes.",

     "abstract": "As care robots become more commonplace in aged-care settings, the ethical debate on their use becomes increasingly important. Our objective was to examine the ethical arguments and underlying concepts used in the ethical debate on care robot use in aged care.We conducted a systematic literature search for argument-based ethics publications focusing on care robot use in aged-care practices. We used an innovative methodology that consisted of three steps: (a) identifying conceptual-ethical questions, (b) conducting a literature search, and (c) identifying, describing and analyzing the ethical arguments in connection with the conceptual-ethical questions.Twenty-eight appropriate publications were identified. All were published between 2002 and 2016. Four primary ethical approaches were distinguished: (a) a deontological, (b) a principlist, (c) an objective-list, and (d) a care-ethical. All approaches were equally represented across the articles, and all used similar concepts that grounded their diverse ethical arguments. A small group of publications could not be linked to an ethical approach.All included publications presented a strong ethical rationale based on fully elaborated normative arguments. Although the reviewed studies used similar grounding concepts, the studies\u2019 arguments were very diverse and sometimes diametrically opposed. Our analysis shows how one envisions care robot use in aged-care settings is influenced by how one views the traditional boundaries of the ethical landscape in aged care. We suggest that an ethical analysis of care robot use employs \u201cdemocratic spaces,\u201d in which all stakeholders in aged care, especially care recipients, have a voice in the ethical debate.",

Up to 8 assessments of cognitive performance (general cognitive ability, verbal, spatial/fluid, memory, and processing speed) from 1986 to 2010 were available. Latent growth curve modelling was used to assess the association between cognitive performance and hospitalization including spline models to analyse cognitive trajectories pre- and post-hospitalization.A total of 735 persons (89%) had at least one hospital admission during the follow-up. Mean age at first hospitalization was 70.2 (\u00b19.3)\u00a0years. Persons who were hospitalized exhibited a lower mean level of cognitive performance in general ability, processing speed and spatial/fluid ability compared with those who were not hospitalized. The two-slope models revealed steeper cognitive decline before hospitalization than after among those with at least one hospitalization event, as compared to non-hospitalized persons who showed steeper cognitive decline after the centering age of 70 years.Persons being hospitalized in late life have lower cognitive performance across all assessed domains. The results indicate that the main decline occurs before the hospitalization, and not after. This might indicate that when you get treatment you also benefit cognitively.",

The optimal scaling system for the VES-13 in predicting health outcomes also has not been adequately tested. This study (1) assesses the applicability of the VES-13 to predict the mortality of community-dwelling older persons in Taiwan, (2) identifies the best scaling system for the VES-13 in predicting mortality using generalized additive models (GAMs), and (3) determines whether including covariates, such as socio-demographic factors and common geriatric syndromes, improves model fitting.This retrospective longitudinal cohort study analyzed the data of 2184 community-dwelling persons 65 years old or older from the 2003 wave of the national-wide Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging. Cox proportional hazards models and Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used.The VES-13 significantly predicted the mortality of Taiwan\u2019s community-dwelling elders. A one-point increase in the VES-13 score raised the risk of death by 26% (hazard ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-1.32). The hazard ratio of death increased linearly with each additional VES-13 score point, suggesting that using a continuous scale is appropriate. Inclusion of socio-demographic factors and geriatric syndromes improved the model-fitting.The VES-13 is appropriate for an Asian population. VES-13 scores linearly predict the mortality of this population. Adjusting the weighting of the physical activity items may improve the performance of the VES-13.",

Admission functional (ADL) performance is a salient factor predicting functional performance in older adults at discharge. The days preceding hospitalization are often associated with functional loss related to the acute illness. An understanding of functional changes during this transition will inform interventions to prevent functional decline. This secondary analysis examined data from a study that evaluated a family educational empowerment model and included 136 dyads (persons with dementia and their family caregiver). AMOS structural equation modeling examined the effects of family caregiver factors upon change in patient ADL performance (Barthel Index) from baseline (two week prior to hospitalization) to the time of admission, controlling for patient characteristics. Eighty-two percent of the patients had decline prior to admission. Baseline function, depression, and dementia severity, as well as Family caregiver strain, were significantly associated with change in pre-admission ADL performance and explained 40% of the variance. There was a good fit of the model to the data (\u03a72\u00a0=\u00a012.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.305, CFI\u00a0=\u00a00.97, TLI\u00a0=\u00a00.90, RMSEA\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Findings suggest the need for a function-focused approach when admitting patients with dementia to the hospital. FCG strain prior to hospitalization may be a factor impacting trajectory of functional changes in older person with dementia, especially in those with advanced dementia. FCG strain is an important assessment parameter in the risk assessment for functional decline, to be considered when engaging the FCG in the plan for functional recovery.",

Therefore, a simplified tool, able to identify these individuals for a more comprehensive evaluation, is required. However, the use of a measuring tool in a different socio-cultural context requires prior adaptation. This article aims to verify the psychometric properties of the PRISMA-7 in Brazilian context. This instrument was previously shown as able to identify older persons living in the community who have risk of functional loss in a Canadian study. In a sample of 1748 older persons, the internal consistency assessed by Cronbach\u2019s alpha showed a borderline value credited to the reduced number of questionnaire items. Factor analysis identified two well correlated factors, except for items 2 and 6. For criterion validity the SMAF scale (French acronym, Functional Autonomy Measurement System) was used as the gold standard. The analysis of the ROC curve indicated a sensitivity of 74.4% and specificity of 87.4% for the cut-off point of 4, while the Canadian version had a cut-off point of 3 for disability detection. Inter and intra-observer reliability, investigated by the Kappa Cohen were high and statistically significant. In conclusion, the results suggest that the validation process was adequate, and recommend the Brazilian version of PRISMA-7, to track older people with functional loss in the community.",

The aim of this study was to estimate the relationship between SPPB and its component of an age-related deficit accumulation index (the so-called Frailty Index [FI] proposed by Rockwood).Data are from a longitudinal cohort study (ie, the Incidence of pNeumonia and related ConseqUences in nursing home Residents [INCUR]) of 730 older persons (74.29% women) living in 13 French nursing homes. The FI was computed as the ratio between 30 actual and potential deficits the participant might have presented at the baseline visit (range between 0 [no deficit] and 1 [30 deficits]). Physical status was assessed using the SPPB score at baseline. Descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were used to determine the relationship between the SPPB and FI and estimate which components of the SPPB were most strongly associated with the FI.Mean age of participants was 86.5 (SD 7.5) years, with a mean FI of 0.37 (SD 0.11) and SPPB of 2.5 (range between 0 and 12). The SPPB and its components were all significantly associated with the FI, but the magnitude of the associations varied. Linear regression analyses adjusted for age, sex, showed that the balance test [beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.045 (95%CI \u22120.042; \u22120.028), p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001] and chair stand test [beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.040 (95%CI \u22120.054; \u22120.027), p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001] was more strongly associated with the FI than the gait speed [beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.015 (95%CI \u22120.021; \u22120.008), p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001].Of the 3 components of the SPPB, both balance and chair tests seem particularly relevant indicator of frailty among very old and complex elders living in nursing homes.",

Disability, sociodemographic characteristics, and psychological, cognitive, and physical factors were considered for the multinomial logistic regression analysis.Statistically significant differences were found among the three groups regarding satisfaction with life, disability, social phobia, anxiety, depression, and frailty (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). In the multinomial regression analysis, being \u201cnot happy\u201d was significantly associated with satisfaction with life (RRR: 0.53), depression (RRR: 1.46), social phobia (RRR: 1.24), and age (RRR: 1.06).The present findings indicate that psychological factors and age influence the levels of happiness in older adults living in the community. Furthermore, better screening, diagnosis, and treatment of mental health disorders could increase the feeling of happiness among older adults.",

Slow walking speed was defined as usual walking speed <1.0\u00a0m/s. Duration of MVPA (activity at an intensity >3 metabolic equivalents) and number of step counts were measured using a uniaxial accelerometer over 1 wk. Body mass index, grip strength, back and leg pain, cognitive function, executive function, and presence of depression were also assessed. Participants with missing data were excluded from the main analysis.The mean age of the participants was 79.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6 y. The prevalence of slow walking speed was 14.9%. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that the duration of MVPA was significantly and inversely associated with slow walking speed, independent from step counts and other confounding factors (adjusted odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.94 per 1\u00a0min/d increment, 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a00.73\u20130.99; p\u00a0=\u00a00.031). This relationship was also observed in sensitivity analysis that included all participants. A MVPA cut-off value of 8.7\u00a0min/d was determined using the receiver operating characteristic analysis.The findings from the present study suggest that promoting MVPA may be helpful to prevent slow walking speed. The validity of MVPA for predicting slow walking speed needs to be confirmed in future prospective studies.",

Although simple methods to predict aspiration and silent aspiration exist, methods for evaluating the masticatory function of patients with dysphagia are lacking. Accordingly, we developed a simple test to assess the chewing and swallowing ability of patients with dysphagia.One hundred and five patients with dysphagia were included. We used the Saku-Saku Test (SST), in which patients were asked to eat a rice cracker, and evaluated the quality of mandibular rotation during mastication. We studied the participants\u2019 ability to grind, aggregate, and swallow using videoendoscopic evaluation (VE) and investigated its association with mandibular rotation.The SST showed good reliability between two examiners, with a kappa coefficient of 0.80. 92.4% of the patients ate the rice cracker without aspiration. The SST showed a high sensitivity of 73.3% and specificity of 93.3% for the degree of grinding. The degree of food bolus aggregation had a sensitivity of 45.0% and specificity of 90.6%, and aspiration had a sensitivity of 25.0% and specificity of 84.5%, both of which showed high specificity.The results of this study suggested that the SST might be simple and useful for identifying patients with dysphagia who are able to masticate, even if they do not eat foods that need chewing and could be used before starting these patients on foods that need chewing.",

Disability was defined as a great difficulty or not being able to perform one and two or more activities in each domain: mobility, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (BADL).The overall mortality rate was 46.1 per 1000 person-years at risk (pyrs) and it was higher in men. Among men, the fully adjusted Hazard Ratios (HRs) were 1.92 (95%CI: 1.43-2.58), 2.07 (95%CI: 1.53-2.79) and 1.65 (95%CI: 1.11-2.45), and among women 1.75 (95%CI: 1.38-2.21), 1.43 (95%CI: 1.11-1.84) and 1.43 (95%CI: 1.05-1.95), for two or more disability in mobility tasks, IADLs and BADLs, respectively, compared to those with no difficulty or some difficulty to perform all the tasks.A similar risk of death for mobility, IADL and BADL in both genders was found, suggesting that any of these domains can be used to identify risk of all-cause mortality among older adults.

The aim of this study is to construct activities of daily livings (ADL) scales for oldest-old adults in the United States and China so as to compare their functional loss sequences.We use data from the Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (n\u00a0=\u00a01607) and Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (n\u00a0=\u00a05570) for years 1998\u20132008. ADL items are calibrated within a scale using the Rasch measurement model. Rasch scores are averaged across survey waves to identify the ADL loss sequence for each study population. We also assess scale stability over measurement periods.Factor analyses confirm that the ADL items in each study population can be combined meaningfully to form a hierarchical sequence. Internal consistency assessed by Cronbach\u2019s alpha is high (0.81 to 0.95). We find that bathing is the first activity that both older Americans and Chinese have difficulty with, while eating is the last activity. There are, however, differences in the rank order for toileting (ranked more challenging in the Chinese sample) and dressing (ranked more challenging in the U.S. sample). Item orderings are stable over time.The results highlight the relative importance of bathing in the functional loss sequence for older adults, regardless of socio-cultural context.

Difficulties in communication in many aspects of daily life occur between the elderly and immigrant spouses, and result in the elderly becoming vulnerable and thus, influencing their psychological well-being. Although past studies demonstrated that due to cultural differences, employed foreign care providers negatively influenced elder care quality (e.g., care receipts\u2019 health or mortality rates), no studies have explored whether immigrant spouses, as family caregivers, have any influence on elderly suicides due to cross cultural communication differences.To address the above gap, this study was to examine the static relationship between immigrant spouses and elderly suicides.National-level authority data, comprising a 10-year longitudinal nationwide sample, were used. The number of immigrant spouses was treated as a proxy of cultural differences. Twelve models of outcomes with and without city- and time-fixed effects were conducted using panel data analysis.Descriptive statistics of the study variables are provided. The results revealed that overall the number of immigrant spouses had a positive correlation with suicides in older adults. Further, the gender of immigrant spouses had different impacts on elderly suicides.This is the first study to examine relation between immigrant spouses and the elderly suicides. The study results provide another viewpoint of understanding of the role of immigrant spouses in elder care, while promoting elder-caregiver interactions for optimal elder health outcomes.",

The linear mixed effects models were conducted to analyze the associations between all dimensions of HRQoL and multimorbidity including distinct multimorbidity patterns.Multimorbidity was found to be negatively associated with HRQoL except memory function. We identified three multimorbidity patterns, which were mainly labelled as degenerative disorders, digestive/respiratory disorders, cardiovascular/metabolic disorders, respectively. And three multimorbidity patterns were associated with lower HRQoL including general health, body function, self-care ability and social adaptability. Besides, the elderly with the multimorbidity pattern mainly labelled as digestive/respiratory disorders or cardiovascular/metabolic disorders had a decline on emotion than those without multimorbidity. According to the analysis of the longitudinal data of the sample, general health, self-care ability, emotion and social adaptability of the participants decreased in different degrees every month.Multimorbidity was associated with lower HRQoL of the community-dwelling elderly.

The aims of this study were: i) to investigate the risk of three-month mortality after discharge from internal medicine and geriatric wards of non-oncologic patients with at least one of the following conditions: permanent bedridden status during the hospital stay; severely reduced kidney function; hypoalbuminemia; hospital admissions in the previous six months; severe dementia; ii) to establish the absolute risk difference of three-month mortality of bedridden compared to non-bedridden patients.This prospective cohort study was run in 102 Italian internal medicine and geriatric hospital wards. The sample included all patients with three-months follow-up data. Bedridden condition was defined as the inability to walk or stand upright during the whole hospital stay. The following parameters were also recorded: estimated GFR\u00a0\u2264\u00a029\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2; severe dementia; albuminemia \u226a2.5\u00a0g/dL; hospital admissions in the six months before the index admission.Of 3915 patients eligible for the analysis, three-month follow-up were available for 2058, who were included in the study. Bedridden patients were 112 and the absolute risk difference of mortality at three months was 0.13 (CI 95% 0.08\u20130.19, p\u00a0\u226a\u00a00.0001). Logistic regression analysis also adjusted for age, sex, number of drugs and comorbidity index found that bedridden condition (OR 2.10, CI 95% 1.12\u20133.94), severely reduced kidney function (OR 2.27, CI 95% 1.22\u20134.21), hospital admission in the previous six months (OR 1.96, CI 95% 1.22\u20133.14), severe dementia (with total or severe physical dependence) (OR 4.16, CI 95% 2.39\u20137.25) and hypoalbuminemia (OR 2.47, CI 95% 1.12\u20135.44) were significantly associated with higher risk of three-month mortality.Bedridden status, severely reduced kidney function, recent hospital admissions, severe dementia and hypoalbuminemia were associated with higher risk of three-month mortality in non-oncologic patients after discharge from internal medicine and geriatric hospital wards.",

This analysis shows that the DTs of the survivors, decedents and dropped-out respondents differ remarkably. The trajectories of the decedents generally begin higher and increase more rapidly. Three types of DT exist for both genders: Type 1, the \u201cindependent type\u201d; Type 2, the \u201clow start, rapidly increasing in late life type\u201d; and Type 3, the \u201chigh start, rapid development type\u201d. Women are more likely to experience a DT of functional impairment. Men who experience the Type 3 trajectory suffer the highest MR, followed by those of the Type 1 and Type 2 trajectories. Women who experience the Type 3 trajectory suffer the highest MR, followed by those of the Type 2 and Type 1 trajectories. In addition, economic status, medical treatment, daily care by the family and chronic diseases mediate the impact of DT on MR for both genders, while the mediating effect of emotional support from children was only observed for women.",

Veterans Health Administration (VHA)\u2019s electronic medical records on male inpatients age 85\u2013100 years (n\u00a0=\u00a0896) with hip fracture diagnosis and repair were used. MCC defined by Charlson and Elixhauser disorders, medications, demographic covariates, and 5 years follow-up survival were included. Latent Class Analysis (LCA) identified three classes based on patterns of MCC, medications, and demographic covariates: Low-comorbidity (16%), High-longevity (55%), and High-comorbidity (29%). Overall, survival censored at 5 years post-op averaged 717\u00a0days. The Low-comorbidity group was more likely to be Hispanic, less disabled per VHA determination of eligibility for care, with less risk of postoperative emergency department (ED) visit, and taking no prescription medications. The High-longevity group had longer survival. The High-comorbidity group had more MCC, more prescription medications and shorter survival than the other two groups. Accelerated failure time (AFT) modeled associations between MCC and 5-year survival by class. In AFT models, fewer days until first postoperative ED visit was significantly associated with survival across the three classes. About one in male hip fractured veteran patients over the age of 85 had high levels of MCC and ED use and experienced shorter survival. Hip fracture patients with MCC may merit enhanced post-discharge management. Close investigation targeted to MCC and hip fractures is needed to optimize clinical practices for oldest-old patients in community healthcare systems as well as VHA.",

A range of countries were represented including Europe, China, Australia, Tunisia, US, and Japan. The population size in the trials ranged from 142 to 4736. All studies included had adequate power to assess treatment effects. Blood pressure goals were variable and ranged from a systolic of <120 to <160 with a diastolic goal of <80\u00a0mmHg. Some studies reported outcomes including all-cause mortality, composite cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, fatal and non-fatal stroke or myocardial infarction, and fatal or nonfatal heart failure. Many trials were stopped early because of the significant findings in mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.The studies discussed had a range of blood pressure goals. The optimal management of hypertension in older adults is still being debated.

Prospective observational studies that investigated the association of circulating interleukin-6 levels with cardiovascular or all-cause mortality in the elderly general population (aged 60 years or more) were included.

Levels of histone acetylation, BDNF and downstream signaling, and inflammatory components were analyzed.Isoflurane exposure in aged rats lead to impaired spatial learning and memory. These rats exhibited dysregulated histone H3K9 and H4K12 acetylation, which was accompanied by reduced BDNF expression and suppressed BDNF downstream signaling pathway. Apigenin restored histone acetylation and BDNF signaling. Apigenin also suppressed isoflurane exposure induced upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines and NF\u03baB signaling pathway.Memory impairment induced by isoflurane exposure is associated with dysregulated histone acetylation in the hippocampus, which affects BDNF expression and hence BDNF downstream signaling pathway. Apigenin recovers cognitive function by restoring histone acetylation and suppressing neuroinflammation.",

     "abstract": "Although several statistical methods for adjusting for missing data have been developed and are widely applied in research, few studies have investigated these methods in adjusting for missingness in datasets that aim to estimate the prevalence of dementia. We attempted to develop a more feasible approach for handling missingness in a cross-sectional study among elderly.Five methods of estimating prevalence, including stratified weighting (SW), inverse-probability weighting (IPW), hot deck imputation (HDI), ordinal logistic regression (OLR) and multiple imputation (MI), were applied to handle the missing data yielded by a dataset that include 2231 non-responders.Compared with the results of the complete case analysis, the differences in the prevalence rates of dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) calculated by the prevalence-estimating methods after adjusting for non-responders were less than 7% and 6%, respectively. In contrast to the results of other methods, the estimated prevalence of dementia and MCI calculated by MI increased when more predictive factors were included, and the lowest rate of missing data was achieved using MI. Using the participants\u2019 ages, the cognitive screening sores and activity of daily life sores as predictive variables when correcting for missingness induced relatively larger effects on the estimated dementia prevalence.When adjusting for missingness while estimating the prevalence of dementia in cross-sectional studies, a simple method, such as SW, is recommended when limited information is available, whereas MI is the preferred method when additional information is available. Further simulation studies are needed to determine the optimal approach.",

Spatiotemporal gait variables, average values and co-efficient of variation (COV) were obtained from 40 consecutive steps during single- and dual-task walk trials. Performance-based measures of the VM and VCG task were obtained during standing and walking.VM dual-task walking had a significant effect on gait measures in the young age group (YG), but no DT effect was observed in the old age group (OG). Visuomotor tracking performance, however, was significantly reduced in the OG as compared to the YG when tested in both standing and walking. The opposite was true for VCG; a significant DT effect on gait performance was observed in the OG, but no DT effect was observed in the YG. Success rate of the VCG task decreased during walking, but only for OG.Controlling gait speed and objective evaluation of the visuospatial cognitive tasks helps to determine the level of engagement in the DT tasks. This is important in order to determine the strategies used during the DT test protocols, i.e. cross-domain interference.",

The present study used a questionnaire constructed for the SABE Study, which was reviewed by experts of Latin America and the Caribbean. The social network was evaluated using the variables: social support received; social support offered; number of members in the social network. The covariates included were age, gender, living arrangements, marital status, income, education, comorbidity, depressive symptoms, cognition and functional difficulties. Death as an outcome was evaluated after four years of follow-up.From a total of 1413 older adults at baseline, 268 died in a mean follow-up period of 3,9 years (SE\u00a0=\u00a00,03). In the model adjusted offering social support and having networks composed of 9 or more members reduced the risk of death in the older adults.This study suggest that older adult who are offered support can benefit from mutual exchanges since reciprocity in relationships improves psychological well-being and is indicative of the quality of relationships.

The aim of the study was to compare physical activity and participation in leisure activities and tourism among older people with and without disabilities in Poland. A cross-sectional, multicenter study (PolSenior) randomly recruited participants aged 65 years and over, in a stratified, proportional draw performed in three stages from all 16 Polish provinces. 3743 people, 2653 (70.9%) without disabilities, and 1090 (29.1%) with disabilities responded providing general sociodemographic characteristics and various health behaviors including subjective physical activity level, leisure time activities, tourism and activity limitations. Older males without disability reported more physical activity than women with disability, while no differences were observed for females with and without disability. Polish older people with and without disability were more involved in gardening and staying in a garden allotment or a holiday home rather than participating in organized forms of sport, physical activity, and tourism. Health conditions arose as the most frequently indicated barrier toward participation in sport physical activity and tourism. In conclusion, strategies and programs to increase physical activity among older Polish people, with and without disability, should focus on preserving health and physical function.",

Participants were asked at each time point if they had been diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis. The baseline evaluation was conducted with 1289 community-dwelling women aged 75\u201385 years, of which 992 reported no history of knee osteoarthritis. The follow-up survey targeted these 992 participants; we obtained history of knee osteoarthritis from 867 of these participants. The baseline evaluation also included collection of anthropometric, fitness, hematologic, and lifestyle data.We performed logistic regression analysis of the cross-sectional data at baseline. Participants who reported fewer light exercise sessions (\u22642\u20134\u00a0days/week) had lower odds ratios for history of self-reported knee osteoarthritis than those who reported more frequent exercise (\u22655\u20136\u00a0days/week). Logistic regression analysis of the longitudinal data revealed that slow walking speed (\u00a0<\u00a065.22\u00a0m/min), low serum albumin levels (\u00a0<\u00a04.10\u00a0g/dL), and low frequency of soy product consumption (\u22641 time per 2\u00a0days) at baseline resulted in higher odds ratios for incidence of self-reported knee osteoarthritis during the 4-year follow-up period.The results suggest that slow walking speed, low serum albumin, and insufficient consumption of soy products are predictors for knee osteoarthritis in elderly Japanese women. These results could help in the design of knee osteoarthritis prevention programs for elderly women.",

The AV measurement was significantly correlated with IS during KE (r\u00a0=\u00a00.303, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and other physical functions. Most correlation coefficients of angular velocity were greater than that of IS. All of physical assessments were significantly improved.

It also implies the possibility that disability may mediate the association between depression and cognitive impairment. Screening for risk factors of cognitive impairment was defined in this study and may be feasible for general population.This study suggests that disability and depression assessments may serve as useful predictors of cognitive impairment. It is hoped that for elderly people, early assessment through screening factors could be arranged to this high-risk subgroup to reduce the risk of developing future dementia.

This evidence reveals the importance of improving knowledge on how individual components of frailty and specific disability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) are related, to offer early, targeted, and tailored interventions. The objective was to examine the association between each of the five frailty phenotype components (weakness, slowness, exhaustion, low physical activity, weight loss) and disability in specific ADL pertaining to physical aspects (bathing, dressing, cutting toe nails, transportation, shopping, housekeeping, food purchasing, food preparation) and cognitive aspects (finances, telephone, medication). A cross-sectional design involving 1643 community-dwelling older adults (65+) from the longitudinal multi-center FR\u00e9LE study was used. Disability was defined as needing help or being unable to perform specific ADL. Multiple logistic regressions were adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics, clinical variables, and for 4 other frailty components. Results showed that low physical activity and slowness were significantly linked to disability in all physical and cognitive aspects of ADL (OR: 1.71\u20139.42; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), except using the telephone.

This study aimed to examine the socio-demographic characteristics of disability in older adults in China.Data was obtained from the China Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment Study (CCGAS). The sample comprised 6864 people aged 60 years and above from seven provinces in China. A door-to-door survey was conducted by formally trained interviewers using a unified questionnaire. Disability was assessed with physical health assessment comprising activities of daily living (ADL), and independent activities of daily living (IADL). For the purpose of this study, we analyzed only disability and some socio-demographic dimensions. The rates were standardized based on China\u2019s Sixth National Census population distribution.The disability rate in older adults was 7.0%. The disability rate was significantly higher in women than men, significantly higher in rural areas than urban areas, and higher in northern China than southern China. Urban disability rates ranged from 5.7% to 1.2%. The differences were statistically significant, with Beijing having the highest and Shanghai the lowest disability rates. Disability increased with age.In China, the disability rate in older adults is 7.0%, and increases with age. The disability rate is significantly higher in women, rural area, and northern China. This is the first study to report the epidemiology of disability in older adults in China in recent years and indicates the need for further epidemiological data on disability in China to facilitate long-term care and care policy formulation.",

Over 12-months of follow-up, fall details were recorded using twice-monthly questionnaires.More than half (59%) of participants fell, with 30% of participants falling more than once (fall rate\u00a0=\u00a01.3 falls per person-year). Slips (22%) and trips (33%) accounted for the majority of falls. Approximately 44% of falls were forward in direction, while backward falls accounted for 41% of falls. About a third of all falls were reported to have lateral (sideways) motion. Subjects reported taking a protective step in response to 82% of forward falls and 37% of backward falls. Of falls reporting lateral motion, a protective step was attempted in 70% of accounts. Common impact locations included the hip/pelvis (47% of falls) and the hand/wrist (27%). Backwards falls were most commonly reported with slips and when changing direction, and increased the risk of hip/pelvis impact (OR\u00a0=\u00a012.6; 95% CI: 4.7\u201333.8). Forward falls were most commonly reported with trips and while hurrying, and increased the risk of impact to the hand/wrist (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.6; 95% CI: 1.2\u20135.9).Falls in older ambulatory women occur more frequently than previously reported, with the fall circumstance and direction dictating impact to common fracture locations. Stepping was a common protective recovery strategy and that may serve as an appropriate focus of interventions to reduce falls in this high risk population.",

The logistic regression model was carried out to determine the association between the serum C-peptide levels and serum lipid levels.The results of the analysis of covariance stratified by sex and serum insulin level showed that the serum triglyceride (TG) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were significantly associated with changes in the serum C-peptide levels, independent of the serum insulin level. The logistic regression analyses indicated that the serum C-peptide levels were positively associated with the serum TG levels, and negatively associated with the serum HDL-C levels. A significant dose-response association was obtained in both men and women.Serum C-peptide levels were strongly associated with increased serum TG and reduced HDL-C levels in the elderly.

Determinants of mortality were obtained. Using multivariable analysis, beta coeffcicients were calculated to build 2 scores able to predict mortality at 6 and 12 months after discharge. The scores were tested on a sample comprising 75% of the patients, who were randomly selected; they were validated using the remaining 25%. Discrimination was assessed using ROC curves. Scores were calculated for each patient and divided into tertiles. Survival analysis was performed.Determinants of mortality at 6 months were dependent ambulation at baseline, full dependence at discharge, length of stay, pluripatology, pressure ulcers, low grip strength, malignacy, and male gender. At 12 months the determinants were: dependent amblation at baseline, full dependence at discharge, pluripatology, low BMI, low grip strength, heart failure, malignacy, and male gender. Discrimination and calibration were excellent. Survival analysis demonstrated different survival trajectories (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for each tertile in both scores.Our incices provide accurate prognostic information in elderly patients after discharge.

Here we present an algorithmic search method for complex biomarkers which may predict or indicate Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other kinds of dementia. We show that our method is universal since it can describe any Boolean function for biomarker discovery. We applied data mining techniques that are capable to uncover implication-like logical schemes with detailed quality scoring. The new SCARF program was applied for the Tucson, Arizona based Critical Path Institute's CAMD database, containing laboratory and cognitive test data for 5821 patients from the placebo arm of clinical trials of large pharmaceutical companies, and consequently, the data is much more reliable than numerous other databases for dementia. The results of our study on this larger than 5800-patient cohort suggest beneficial effects of high B12 vitamin level, negative effects of high sodium levels or high AST (aspartate aminotransferase) liver enzyme levels to cognition. As an example for a more complex and quite surprising rule: Low or normal blood glucose level with either low cholesterol or high serum sodium would also increase the probability of bad cognition with a 3.7 multiplier.

Step 1 identified mobility measurement instruments used to assess patients 60 years of age and over hospitalized in acute care or intensive geriatric rehabilitation unit. Aim of the instrument, coverage of mobility construct, applicability (format, training required, administration time and use of assistive devices) were extracted. For each included instrument, Step 2 identified and appraised articles reporting about their measurement properties. Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) was used by two independent reviewers to critically appraise and compare the measurement properties. Step 1 resulted in 6350 articles, of which 28 articles reported about 17 different instruments. Step 2 retained 11 instruments with 70 articles reporting about their measurement properties in various settings. Judgement-based instruments (n\u00a0=\u00a05) covered the ICF mobility construct more broadly than performance-based measures (n\u00a0=\u00a06).

The proportion of RCTs with an unexplained cut off was then correlated over time to look for any changes.5680 papers were identified and 1339 excluded as they did not meet the search criteria. Of the remaining 4341 RCTs, 1258 (29%) had upper age limits specified, 1168 (92.8%) of which did not have any explanation for this cut off, a total of 26.9% of the RCTs reviewed. Over the 18-year period there was limited but statistically significant decrease in the proportion of RCTs with unexplained upper age limits (Pearson Correlation \u22120.609, P valve 0.007).Despite being the highest consumers of medical interventions and medications, this review highlights that older patients remain under-represented in clinical trial with only modest improvements despite increasing awareness of the problem.

We compared the prevalence of falling in the past month between stroke survivors and demographic and comorbidity matched controls using sequential Poisson regression models.The proportion of stroke survivors reporting a fall in the previous month was 18.8% compared to 10.8% among matched controls (PR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.36\u20132.25).

Indoor tripping hazards were associated with falls (PR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.53). The association between stroke and falls was modified by neighborhood social disorder, such that in areas of low social disorder, falls in the previous month were more common in stroke survivors compared to non-stroke controls.The difference in falls among stroke survivors and matched controls is largely explained by known risk factors and physical capacity. Indoor tripping hazards were associated with falls among stroke survivors and matched controls. Explanations of why the association between stroke and falls was protective in areas of high social disorder are unclear, but may warrant additional research.",

     "abstract": "Research indicates gender differences in functional performance at advanced ages, but little is known about their impact on longevity for men and women.To derive a set of motor function factors from a battery of functional performance measures and examine their associations with mortality, incorporating possible gender interactions.Analyses were performed on the longitudinal Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA) including twenty-four assessments of motor function up to six times over a 19-year period. Three motor factors were derived from several factor analyses; fine motor, balance/upper strength, and flexibility. A latent growth curve model was used to capture longitudinal age changes in the motor factors and generated estimates of intercept at age 70 (I), rates of change before (S1) and after age 70 (S2) for each factor. Cox regression models were used to determine how gender in interaction with the motor factors was related to mortality.Females demonstrated lower functional performance in all motor functions relative to men. Cox regression survival analyses demonstrated that both balance/upper strength, and fine motor function were significantly related to mortality. Gender specific analyses revealed that this was true for women only. For men, none of the motor factors were related to mortality.Women demonstrated more difficulties in all functioning facets, and only among women were motor functioning (balance/upper strength and fine motor function) associated with mortality. These results provide evidence for the importance of considering motor functioning, and foremost observed gender differences when planning for individualized treatment and rehabilitation.",

Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between lower muscle mass and MetS and determine whether there was any gender difference or not.A total of 394 middle-aged and elderly Taiwanese adults (138 males and 256 females) were enrolled and completed our health survey. They were stratified into three groups according to appendicular skeletal muscle mass divided by weight. Participants distributed into the lower tertile were defined as people having lower muscle mass. MetS was defined using the Adult Treatment Panel III Asian diagnostic criteria. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between muscle and MetS.We found an inverse association between MetS and muscle mass in both males and females. Participants with lower muscle mass had a higher risk of MetS in univariate analysis. The same results were observed when adjusted for age and when also adjusted for living condition factors.

To fill this gap, and to inform the development of a prevention program, we sought to explore the experiences and fall prevention knowledge and practices of older adults who had sustained an outdoor fall.A cross-sectional study using random digit telephone dialing was used to survey community dwelling seniors (N\u00a0=\u00a0120) across the five boroughs of New York City. We used the Outdoor Falls Questionnaire (OFQ), a valid and reliable tool as the survey instrument. Perceived outdoor fall risks, strategies used for prevention, and outdoor fall experiences were examined. SPSS version 21 was used for descriptive analysis of participant characteristics and to determine frequencies of perceived outdoor fall risks and strategies used for prevention. Phenomenological analysis was used with the qualitative data. Qualitative and quantitative data were analyzed separately and a mixed methods matrix was used to interpret and integrate the findings.Analysis revealed diverse unmet education and training needs including the importance of using single vision glasses, understanding the fall risks associated with recreational areas and parking lots, safe outdoor walking strategies, safe carrying of items on level and uneven surfaces, as well as when walking up and down stairs, and safety in opening/closing doors.Study findings are informative for outdoor fall prevention programs as well as practice.",

Surveys elicited perceptions of healthcare with respect to: care coordination and quality; access to medical care; getting or delaying healthcare because of financial reasons; transportation; and usual source of care. The outcome was receipt of recommended medical care, expressed as an aggregate of 38 indicators covering initial evaluation, diagnostic tests, therapeutic interventions, hospitalization follow-up, and routine preventive care. Multivariable survey logistic regression produced odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for receipt of recommended medical care, adjusted for sociodemographics, insurance, comorbidities, and disability.Beneficiaries who reported having trouble getting or reported delaying healthcare because of financial reasons (barrier) (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.79, 95% CI: 0.73\u20130.86) and those who reported having no usual source of care (facilitator) (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a00.55, 95% CI: 0.48\u20130.63) were less likely to receive recommended medical care.Survey data that capture patient perceptions of facilitators and barriers to healthcare may be useful for identifying system factors that affect timely receipt of recommended medical care.

A crucial element of this approach involves encouraging older adults to explicitly analyze tasks to consider how to adapt trained skills to a new task context. In an earlier study, a specialist-directed intervention produced training gains and transfer to some untrained memory tasks.In the present study, older adults received a manual instructing them about principles of task analysis, two memory strategies, and strategy adaptation. Self-guided strategy-adaption training involved practicing some memory tasks as well as instructions on how the trained skills could be applied to new tasks that were not practiced. The criterion tasks involved practice tasks, non-practiced tasks that were discussed in the manual, and transfer tasks that were never mentioned in the manual. Two of the tests were from the Everyday Cognition Battery (inductive reasoning and working memory).As compared to a waiting-list control group, older adults assigned to self-guided strategy-adaption training showed memory improvements on tasks that were practiced or discussed during training. Most important, the learner-oriented approach produced transfer to the everyday tasks.Our findings show the potential of instructing task appraisal processes as a basis for fostering transfer, including improving older adults\u2019 performance in simulated everyday tasks.",

The study design was qualitative descriptive with data being collected from focus-group interviews with members of geriatric care teams. The data collection was conducted at a Swedish university hospital with 69 beds for geriatric care. It comprised five group interviews with a total of 32 staff members, including representatives of all the seven professions working with geriatric care. Data was analysed using qualitative content analysis and a thematic framework approach. Three main themes were identified as being perceived as characterising important factors essential for quality geriatric care: Interactive assessment processes, A holistic care approach, and Proactive non-hierarchical interaction. Aspects of Time and Goal-Orientation were additionally running like common threads through these themes and informed them. Accessibility, open communication, and staff continuity were experienced as prerequisites for well-functioning teamwork. Including patients and relatives in care planning and implementation was seen as essential for good care, but was at risk due to budget cuts that imposed shortened hospital stays. To meet the care demands of the growing population of older frail people, more specialised team-based care according to the concept of Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment \u2013 which is possibly best provided by older-friendly hospitals \u2013 appears as a constructive solution for reaching high degrees of both staff and patient satisfaction in geriatric care.

     "abstract": "Despite clinical practice guidelines, asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older people is frequently treated. A common reason for treating ASB is a change in mental status.To determine how often asymptomatic UTI is treated in older medically ill delirious individuals and its association with functional recovery.Consecutive older medical in-patients were screened for delirium, and followed in hospital. Treatment for asymptomatic UTI was defined as documented treatment for a possible urinary tract infection with antibiotics, without concurrent infectious or urinary symptoms. The primary outcome was functional recovery at discharge or 3 months post-discharge. Poor functional recovery was defined by any one of death, new permanent long-term institutionalization or decreased ability to perform activities of daily living.The study sample comprised 343 delirious in-patients, of which 237 (69%) had poor functional recovery. Ninety two (27%) delirious in-patients were treated for asymptomatic UTI. Treatment for asymptomatic UTI was associated with poor functional recovery compared to other delirious in-patients (RR 1.30, 95% CI: 1.14\u20131.48 overall). Similar results were seen when the analysis was restricted to only bacteriuric delirious individuals. Seven (7.5%) individuals treated for asymptomatic UTI developed Clostridium difficile infection compared to eight (3.2%) in the remainder of the delirious cohort (OR 2.45, 95% CI: 0.86\u20136.96).These results suggest that treatment of asymptomatic UTI in older medical in-patients with delirium is common, and of questionable benefit. Further research is needed to establish guidelines to minimize over-treatment of UTI in older delirious in-patients.",

This study aimed to determine whether delirium was associated with all-cause one-year mortality after hip fracture in older patients and whether the effect of delirium was independent of dementia status.A retrospective analysis of linked hospitalisation and mortality data for patients aged \u226565 years with a hip fracture during 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2014 in New South Wales, Australia. The association between delirium and mortality after a hip fracture was assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression.There were 4,065 (14.6%) of 27,888 hip fracture hospitalisations identified with delirium during hospitalisation. Individuals with delirium had a higher age-adjusted rate of all-cause one-year mortality after hip fracture compared to individuals without delirium (35.3% versus 23.9%). After adjusting for covariates, the risk of all-cause mortality was increased at one-year post-admission for older individuals compared to those aged 65-69 years, for individuals with multiple comorbidities, dementia (Hazard Ratio (HR): 1.14; 95%CI:1.08-1.20), delirium (HR: 1.19; 95%CI:1.12-1.26), and who had an Intensive Care Unit admission (HR: 1.44; 95%CI:1.31-1.59). Comorbid delirium did not add additional mortality risk for individuals with a hip fracture who have dementia.Delirium identified in hospital was associated with all-cause one-year mortality after hip fracture in older Australians without dementia. As delirium is potentially preventable, better systematic assessment and documentation of a hip fracture patient\u2019s cognitive state is warranted to select the most effective strategies to prevent and manage delirium.",

The objective of the present study is to compare the predictive value of 3 different frailty instruments, for selected outcomes.The study sample includes 1278 participants of the Three-City study, a French prospective population-based study, assessed for frailty using Fried's phenotype criteria, Rockwood's Frailty Index and Tilburg Frailty Indicator.To assess the risk of mortality, incident disability, falls, institutionalization and hospitalization for a follow up period of 12 years, Cox proportional hazard models with delayed entry have been used. The area under the time-dependent ROC curve has been used to estimate and compare the ability of the three instruments of frailty to predict the previous adverse outcomes at 12 years.Five hundred ninety four participants were identified as non-robust with Fried's criteria; 169 with Rockwood's FI and 303 with TFI. The three scales consistently identified 91 participants as non-robust and 574 as robust. Rockwood's FI was a statistically significant predictor of mortality, incident disability and falls, and a strong predictor of hospitalization.In the absence of a \u201cgold standard\u201d definition of frailty, a debate on what measures and how to include them is open.

     "abstract": "Among older adults, perceived age discrimination is highly associated with unhealthy outcomes and dissatisfaction. Active aging is a multidimensional concept described by a set of characteristics, particularly health, positive mood and control; most importantly, active aging is currently at the core of public policies. The aim of the present study was to test to what extent perceived discrimination influences active aging. Methods A total of 2005 older adults in three representative samples from regions of Germany, Mexico and Spain participated; they were tested on active aging and perceived discrimination. First, active aging was defined as high reported health, life satisfaction and self-perception of aging. Second, authors introduced the assumption that, in the total sample, structural equation modelling would confirm the hypothesis of a direct negative link between perceived age discrimination and active aging. Finally, multiple group comparison performed through structural equation modelling also provided support for the negative association between perceived discrimination and active aging proposed. In spite of the differences found among the three countries in both active aging variables and age discrimination perception, multiple group comparison indicates that regardless of the culture, perceived discrimination is a negative predictor of active aging.",

     "abstract": "Winter weather conditions may negatively influence participation of older adults in daily physical activity (PA). OBJECTIVE: Assess the influence of winter meteorological variables, day-time peak ambient temperature, windchill, humidity, and snow accumulation on the ground to accelerometer measured PA values in older adults. METHODS: 50 community-dwelling older adults (77.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7yrs; range 71\u201389; 12 females) living in Southwestern Ontario (Latitude 42.9\u00b0N Longitude 81.2\u00b0 W) Canada, wore a waist-borne accelerometer during active waking hours (12\u00a0h) for 7 consecutive days between February and April 2007. Hourly temperature, windchill, humidity, and snowfall accumulation were obtained from meteorological records and time locked to hourly accelerometer PA values. CONCLUSIONS: Regression analysis revealed significant relationships between time of day, ambient daytime high temperature and a humidity for participation in PA. Windchill temperature added no additional influence over PA acclamation already influenced by ambient day-time temperature and the observed variability in PA patterns relative to snow accumulation over the study period was too great to warrant its inclusion in the model. Most PA was completed in the morning hours and increased as the winter month\u2019s transitioned to spring (February through April). PRACTICE: An equation was developed to adjust for winter weather conditions using temperature, humidity and time of day. IMPLICATIONS: Accurate PA assessment during the winter months must account for the ambient daytime high temperatures, humidity, and time of day. These older adults were more physically active during the morning hours and became more active as the winter season transitioned to spring.",

Because of these demonstrated relationships, it can be hypothesized that both depression and resilience are mediators of the association between family function and QOL.To test this hypothesis, the structural equation model (SEM) constructed by Amos 21.0 was employed to assess the indirect effect of depression (Geriatric Depression Scale, GDS) and resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, CD-RISC) on the relationship between family function (Family APGAR Score, APGAR) and QOL (12-item Short Form health survey, SF-12) in 474 elderly adults from three communities in Guangzhou, China.Correlation matrix showed that depression is significantly negatively correlated with family functioning (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.54, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), resilience (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.46, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and QOL (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.63, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), while resilience is significantly positively correlated with family functioning (r\u00a0=\u00a00.35, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and QOL (r\u00a0=\u00a00.40, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

This study explored the relationship between people's concern about developing AD/dementia, likelihood to be screened/tested, if experiencing changes in cognitive status or functioning, and concerns about sharing the diagnostic information with others.A descriptive study was conducted using Porter Novelli's SummerStyles 2013 online survey data. Of the 6105 panelists aged 18+ who received the survey, 4033 adults responded (response rate: 66%). Chi squares were used with case-level weighting applied.Almost 13% of respondents reported being very worried or worried about getting AD/dementia, with women more worried than men (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and AD/dementia caregivers more worried than other types of caregivers (p\u00a0=\u00a0.04). Women were also more likely than men to agree to be screened/tested if experiencing changes in memory and/or thinking (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The greater the worry, the more likely respondents would agree to be screened/tested (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Nearly 66% of respondents were concerned that sharing a diagnosis would change the way others think/feel about them, with women reporting greater concern than men (p\u00a0=\u00a0.003).Findings demonstrate that level of worry about AD/dementia is associated with the reported likelihood that individuals agree to be screened/tested. This information will be useful in developing communication strategies to address public concern about AD/dementia that may increase the likelihood of screening and early detection.",

Salivary cortisol was collected from a subsample of 309 participants instructed to collect saliva on two consecutive days, and 5 different intervals each day: upon awakening (M1), 30\u00a0min (M2) and 60\u00a0min after awakening, at 15:00\u00a0h and before bedtime (E). Cortisol was analyzed using enzyme immunoassay kits. Physical performance was measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Mixed linear models were fit to assess the associations between cortisol diurnal output and physical performance, adjusting for potential confounders.Kingston, Saint-Hyacinthe and Tirana residents had significantly higher cortisol values than their Manizales counterparts, with the population from Tirana showing the highest levels. Attenuated morning cortisol peak (M2) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), higher cortisol bed time (E) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and lower M2/E ratio (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were found among those with SPPB<9 compared with those with good physical performance (SPPB\u00a0\u2265\u00a09).

It is know that some of the measurement scales used show hierarchical properties indicating that activities of daily living are lost and gained in a consistent pattern. Few studies have investigated the extent to which these patterns are sustained across time and across a range of disability. The study aimed to investigate the hierarchical properties of the activity of daily living items in the ValGraf functional ability scale, to establish if there is a hierarchy of items in the scale and to study the sustainability of the hierarchy over time. Secondary analysis of a retrospective database from 13,113 people over 65 years in 105 nursing homes in northern Italy, between 2008 and 2013 was conducted. Data were gathered 6-monthly and analysed using Mokken scaling to identify a hierarchy of items in the scale and if this was sustainable over time. A sustainable hierarchy of items was observed running in difficulty from urinary incontinence to feeding. The hierarchical structure of the activities of daily living observed in the present study is stable over time meaning that changes in total score for these items can be compared meaningfully across time.",

     "abstract": "Using stress process theory and structural equation modelling, this study investigated the complex relationship between health status, family strain, dependency, and the life satisfaction of rural older adults with reported functional impairments in India. Data were extracted from a large-scale study of 903 randomly selected adults aged 61 years and older from 30 rural clusters of India. The sample for this study was confined to 653 older adults who reported functional impairments. Structural equation modelling showed that poor health status indirectly lowered the life satisfaction of older adults through family strains. Moreover, poor health status also indirectly influenced life satisfaction through dependency and family strain (poor health\u00a0\u2192\u00a0dependency\u00a0\u2192\u00a0family strains\u00a0\u2192\u00a0life satisfaction). The findings indicate that for professionals who deal with the health of older adults, exploring relationship strains and dependency is vital to the assessment and intervention of subjective wellbeing. Inter-sectoral coordination and communication between healthcare and social service agencies might facilitate effective management of health problems among older adults. Moreover, taking family strains and dependency into account when caring for older adults with health problems is critical to help improve their quality of life and maintain their wellbeing.",

The objectives of this systematic review were to provide an overview of the literature on (1) the association between mastication and cognitive function and (2) the association between mastication and dementia incidence, in elderly people.Searches were conducted on five electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINHL, Cochrane Library, and Pro Quest) and publications were selected that met the following criteria: published between 2005 and 2015, written in English, and assessed associations between mastication and cognitive function, cognitive decline and dementia among population over 40 years old. The included publications were analyzed for study design, main conclusions, and strength of evidence by two reviewers who screened all abstracts and full-text articles, abstracted data and performed quality assessments by using a critical appraisal tool.A total of 33 articles (22 cross-sectional, and 11 prospective cohort studies) were evaluated. Poorer mastication was associated with lower cognitive function in 15 of the 17 cross-sectional studies and steeper decline in 5 of the 6 prospective studies. Poorer mastication was one of significant risk factors for having dementia or mild memory impairment (MMI) in 4 of 5 cross-sectional studies and for the incidence of dementia or MMI in 4 of 5 prospective studies.Most studies point to a positive association between mastication and cognitive function, including dementia among elderly people.",

Ultimately, we sought to investigate the impact of frailty on cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in older AF patients.We retrospectively evaluated 365 patients (\u226565\u00a0years old) with AF, who underwent comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) between 2007 and 2014 in a single tertiary hospital. The CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores were calculated based on the electronic medical records and the frailty index was computed from the CGA data. The primary outcomes were cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.Frailty status was positively associated with the CHA2DS2-VASc score (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the HAS-BLED score (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Patients with high CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores were more likely to be treated with anticoagulants rather than antiplatelet agents. However, frailty status was not associated with antithrombotic therapy. During the follow-up period (median [interquartile range], 22.9 [8.4\u201342.2] months), 141 patients (38.6%) died, of which 48 were due to cardiovascular events. CHA2DS2-VASc score could predict cardiovascular mortality, but not all-cause mortality. In contrast, frailty status was the independent predictor for both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality after adjusting for possible confounders (hazard ratio for all-cause mortality, 4.549; 95% CI, 2.756\u20137.509; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Frailty assessment can be used to predict mortality in older AF patients, and provides additional prognostic value, along with the CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED scores.",

The degree of changes in both study groups was similar, except from the absolute value of the UT elasticity, significantly higher increase in older women than in younger subjects (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Age contributes to an increase in the stiffness and tone of the UT and the SCM, as well as to a decrease in the elasticity of these muscles in female subjects.

     "abstract": "To date, an optimal working model which predicts biological age (BA) with a set of working biomarkers has not been devised to represent the Korean female population. Accuracy of prediction and applicability are required of an optimal set of commonly assessed biomarkers to provide information on the health status. The goal of this study was to identify a set of biomarkers that represent the aging process and to develop and compare different BA prediction models to elucidate the most fitting and applicable model for providing information on health status in the Korean female population. Using a series of selection processes, eight clinically assessable variables were selected by analyzing relations between 31 clinical variables and chronologic age in 912 normal, healthy individuals among 3642 female participants with ages ranging from 30 to 80 years. The multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component analysis (PCA), and the Klemera-Doubal (KDM) statistical methods were applied to obtain three different sets of BA prediction models. These three models were assessed by calculating and performing the coefficient determinations (r2), regression slopes, effect sizes, pairwise t-tests, and Bland-Altman plots. The BA models were further compared for the applicability by calculating the BAs of clinical risk groups. MLR showed the narrowing effects at the either ends of the age spectrum with greatest effect sizes. PCA showed the greatest degree of dispersion and deviation from the regression center. These MLR and PCA trends were also exhibited by clinically risk groups. In conclusion, the KDM BA prediction model based on the selected biomarkers was found to provide the most reliable and stable results for the practical assessment of BA.",

Information about the health status of participants was gathered from history, medical documentation, test assessing frailty, according to the Canadian Study of Health and Aging-Clinical Frailty Scale (CSHA-CFS) and the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short Form (MNA-SF). Seventy five residents (46.9%) were identified as affected by coexisting severe frailty and malnutrition. After a 12-month follow-up period, 42 (26.3%) residents died. In the Cox regression analysis, coexisting severe frailty and malnutrition, and heart failure were associated with mortality during the 12-month follow-up period among the oldest old nursing home residents (adjusted HR 10.89, 95% CI 4.04\u201329.33, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; and adjusted HR 7.83, 95% CI 3.25\u201318.88, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, respectively).

     "abstract": "The age-related decrease in human skeletal muscle mass; i.e. sarcopenia, has received much attention, but an age-related increase in the ratio of adipose tissue to muscle tissue has received noticeably less. A few studies have shown that ultrasonographic echo intensity, an index of the adipose-to-muscle ratio, is negatively associated with functional capacity, but the best parameters by which to predict this ratio have not yet been established for older individuals. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationships between quadriceps femoris (QF) echo intensity and demographic, functional and morphological characteristics of older men and women. Sixty-four healthy men (n\u00a0=\u00a027) and women (n\u00a0=\u00a037) aged 62\u201388 years (72.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0\u00a0years) participated in this study. The echo intensity and muscle thickness of the QF were calculated using ultrasonography. Sit-up, supine-up, sit-to-stand, 5-m maximal walk and 6-min walk tests were performed. There were no significant differences in QF echo intensity between sexes, but QF echo intensity was significantly correlated with QF muscle thickness. Stepwise multiple regression analysis with QF echo intensity as a dependent variable revealed QF muscle thickness, sit-to-stand test in men and age, and QF muscle thickness and sit-to-stand test in women, to be significant variables. These results suggest that QF echo intensity can be explained by QF muscle thickness, sit-to-stand and/or age in older men and women; however, an \u201cage\u201d effect was present only in men.",

The present study was designed to evaluate the link between socioeconomic status (SES), physical activity (PA), independence (I) and the health status (HS) of older people in Iran, using structural equation modelling.Using computerized randomly selection, a representative sample of 851 75-year-olds living in Tehran (2007\u20132008), Iran, was included. Participants answered questions regarding indicators of HS, SES and also PA and I through interviews. Both measurement and conceptual models of our hypotheses were tested using Mplus 5. Maximum-likelihood estimation with robust standard errors (MLR estimator), chi-square tests, the goodness of fit index (and degrees of freedom), as well as the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RSMEA) were used to evaluate the model fit.The measurement model yielded a reasonable fit to the data, \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a0110.93, df\u00a0=\u00a038; CFI\u00a0=\u00a00.97; RMSEA\u00a0=\u00a00.047, with 90% C.I.\u00a0=\u00a00.037\u20130.058.

The main outcome was osteoporosis confirmed by DXA.The mean age of the participants was 75.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0years old. Overall, the most prevalent variables for osteoporosis were height loss in adulthood (41.0%), lack of dairy products or calcium supplements (32.0%) and insufficient physical activity (10.4%).

Cluster analyses showed four distinct dietary profiles for each gender. In older men, the four distinct dietary clusters were associated with any differences in sociodemographic and diet-related variables, cognitive function, and health and psychological factors. Likewise, in older women, the four distinct dietary clusters were associated with any differences in sociodemographic and \u2018diet-related' variables\u2019. However in older women, results showed that the cluster 1 \u201chigh fish-fruit-vegetable\u201d was associated with a better cognitive function, a better self-rated health and no depressive symptoms, whereas cluster 3 \u201cmoderate ready meals\u201d was associated with cognitive decline, slight depression, and poor perceived health. Results emphasize the interest to take into consideration health and psychological factors associated with dietary patterns to better target the vulnerability of individuals and enable an effective prevention.",

Self-rated health status, socioeconomic variables over the life course, and demographic variables were included in the analysis. A group-based trajectory model was used to investigate the association between self-rated health and explanatory variables.The enrolled men and women were divided into three groups by trajectory analysis, which showed marked differences in self-rated health trajectories from childhood to senescence. Among older men, those who experienced skipping meals in childhood and those with chronic disease conditions were more likely to be in the lower trajectory groups. Compared to the older men, the likelihood of being in the lower trajectory groups in older women was increased by experience of skipping meals, lower household income, housekeeping labor, receiving Basic Livelihood Security and chronic disease conditions.Various self-rated health trajectories of the Korean older population were identified, and differed according to socioeconomic variables during their life course. Therefore, socioeconomic variables during the life course should be monitored, and health policies directed at the elderly should focus on initial health status from the perspective of a life-course approach.",

Participants were divided into never users of bisphosphonates, use prior to rehabilitation only, use after rehabilitation only, and current users (use before and after rehabilitation). We calculated change in 20-point Barthel scores during rehabilitation, adjusting for comorbid disease and laboratory data using multivariable regression analysis. Cox regression analyses were performed to analyse the association between bisphosphonate use and time to death or hospitalisation.2797 patients were included in the analysis. Current bisphosphonate users showed greater improvement in Barthel score during rehabilitation than non-users (5.0 points [95%CI 4.3\u20135.7] vs 3.8 [95%CI 3.6\u20133.9]), but no difference compared to those receiving bisphosphonates only after discharge (5.1 [95%CI 4.6\u20135.5]). Previous bisphosphonate use was significantly associated with time to death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.41 [95%CI 1.15\u20131.73]) but less strongly with time to combined endpoint of hospitalisation or death (adjusted hazard ratio 1.18 [95%CI 0.98\u20131.48]).

The groups were compared with regard to lifestyle, cortical bone thickness, cancellous bone density, bone metabolism markers, blood leptin levels, and sympathetic nervous system activity as evaluated by heart rate variability analysis.Significant differences were observed between the two groups in cortical bone thickness, blood TRACP-5b, and leptin levels. The L/H ratio (an index of sympathetic nervous system activity) was higher in the SS group than in the NS group. Significant negative correlations were observed between cortical bone thickness and both the L/H ratio and leptin levels, and a significant positive correlation was observed between the L/H ratio and leptin levels.Short sleep was associated with a decline in cortical bone thickness due to the promotion of bone resorption and sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity in the middle-aged group. Leptin levels and cortical bone thickness were found to be closely related, suggesting that cortical bone mass may be regulated via interaction with the leptin-sympathetic nervous system.",

The evolution and factors of home-based care utilization are the prerequisites for the formulation of a support policy. However, no extant research has studied home-based elder care on a national scale.This paper aims to examine changing caregiving relationships nationwide for home-based elderly individuals and investigate the changing factors of care utilization in a ten-year period, with special attention to the effects of \u201clocation\u201d on care patterns.The data come from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Andersen and Newman's behavioral model is employed as the theoretical framework for this research. The trends in care use from 2002 to 2011 are explored and multilevel multinomial analyses are performed to investigate the changing factors of care patterns between 2002 and 2011.From 2002 to 2011, China saw a sharp decrease in children as caregivers, a significant increase in spousal caregivers, and a gradual decrease in other caregivers. Compared to 2002, the effects of the predisposing and enabling factors are more important than the need factors in 2011. Location and the interactions of the north-south divide and the urban-rural divide had a significant effect on care patterns.From 2002 to 2011, there was a decline in the traditional values-advocated care system and the elderly had to rely more on their own resources to find caregivers. In the design of a support program, there is an urgent need for policy makers to take social inequality among elderly individuals and the effects of location into consideration.",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to compare the use of three body size variables (body mass, fat-free mass and body height) in allometric normalization for Handgrip strength among older adults. Methods: Data from individuals admitted to the Elderly Care Center of the Open University of the Third Age were used, the sample consisting of 263 individuals (140 women), aged between 60\u201387.The results provided allometric exponents for normalization of HGS in each body size variable (body mass: 0.31; fat-free mass: 0.11; body height: 0.46). The correlations between normalized HGS and body size variables were significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) when HGS were normalized by body mass or fat-free mass.

The Jadad Criteria and McHarm Tool were used to assess the quality of the trials.A total of 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eighty AEs and 27 reasons for treatment discontinuation were described in the included studies and further explored. Anticholinergic AEs were more common in antimuscarinics compared to placebo. Incidence of dizziness, dyspepsia, and urinary retention with fesoterodine, headache with darifenacin, and urinary tract infections with solifenacin were significantly higher compared to placebo. Treatment discontinuation due to AEs and dry mouth were higher in the antimuscarinics when compared to placebo in older adults.Treatment for overactive bladder using antimuscarinics in adults aged 65 or older resulted in significant increases in risk for several AEs compared to placebo including anticholinergic and non-anticholinergic AEs.",

The aim of this review was to assess the current level of evidence regarding the health benefits of AT in the population aged 70 years and over. A comprehensive, systematic database search for manuscripts was performed. Two reviewers independently assessed interventional studies for potential inclusion. Cardiovascular, metabolic, functional, cognitive, and QoL outcomes were targeted. Fifty-three studies were included totalling 2051 seniors aged 70 years and over. Studies selected were divided into 5 categories according to their main outcomes: cardiovascular function (34 studies), metabolic outcomes (26 studies), functional fitness (19 studies), cognitive functions (8 studies), and QoL (3 studies). With a good level of evidence but a wide heterogeneity between study designs, a significant and beneficial effect of AT was measured on the 5 outcomes. For QoL results showed a significant but slighter improvement. This systematic review highlights the benefits of AT on seniors\u2019 health outcome such as cardiovascular, functional, metabolic, cognitive, and QoL outcomes although the optimal program remains unclear. When more studies regarding this specific population are needed to determine the most favourable exercise program, clinicians should nevertheless encourage older adults over 70 to participate in AT programs to favour active and healthy ageing.",

Falls information was collected from the patient and significant other once a month for three months following hospital discharge. Significant correlations were found between physiotherapist-rated engagement and intellectual (rs\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.22, p\u00a0<0.05) and anticipatory awareness (rs\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.24, p\u00a0<0.05).

Regression analyses indicated that overall self-awareness provided a unique contribution to occupational therapist-rated engagement when controlling for age, gender, cognition and functional ability. Falls were reported by 29.9% of participants, however, self-awareness did not differ significantly between fallers and non-fallers. The findings suggest that self-awareness of falls risk is associated with rehabilitation engagement and motivation.

Subjective well-being is measured by happiness and life satisfaction, and leisure participation is examined by the type and diversity of leisure activities.Principal components analysis identifies four major types of leisure activity that elderly Chinese are actively engaged in\u2014detachment-recovery, aesthetic, social, and performing-arts activities. Among them, social activities and performing-arts activities have the most relevance to subjective well-being. Females are more likely to engage in social and performing-arts activities whereas males are more likely to engage in detachment-recovery and aesthetic activities. Performing-arts activities promote subjective well-being only for females. Social activities are beneficial for both gender groups, but more so for males than for females. While increased levels of leisure diversity are linearly related to increased odds of subjective well-being for females, moderate level of leisure diversity is found to be the most important for males.Leisure participation is positively related to subjective well-being among elderly Chinese, and thus could play a critical role in promoting healthy aging. The major gender differences as observed suggest the need to further explore gender-specific barriers in leisure participation.",

The depressive disorder diagnosis was determined according to DSM-IV based on medical records and interview data including assessment scales for depressive disorders. A number of sociodemographic, functional and health-related variables were analysed as possible confounders.Results For those with no depressive disorders at baseline, the only baseline variable significantly associated with depressive disorders five years later was the PGCMS score.

Environmental barriers at entrances and in exterior surroundings were objectively registered (Housing Enabler screening tool) and divided into tertiles. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, number of chronic diseases, cognitive function, month of assessment, type of neighborhood, and years lived in the current home.At home entrances a median of 6 and in the exterior surroundings 5 environmental barriers were objectively recorded, and 20% of the participants perceived entrance-related barriers. The odds for moving out-of-home less than daily increased when participants perceived entrance-related barrier(s) or when they lived in homes with higher numbers of objectively recorded environmental barriers at entrances. Participants with limitations in lower extremity performance were more susceptible to these environmental barriers. Objectively recorded environmental barriers in the exterior surroundings did not compromise out-of-home mobility.Entrance-related environmental barriers may hinder community-dwelling older people to move out-of-home daily especially when their functional capacity is compromised.

Reduced sensitivity of older muscles to respond to anabolic stimuli, i.e. anabolic resistance, is part of the underlying mechanisms. Although, muscle parameters have been studied in mice of various ages/strains; the aim was to study if mice display similar deteriorating processes as human ageing.Therefore, 10,16,21 and 25 months-old C57BL6/6J male mice were studied to measure parameters of sarcopenia and factors contributing to its pathophysiology, with the aim of characterizing sarcopenia in old mice.Muscle mass of the hind limb was lower in 25 as compared to 10 month-old mice. A significant decrease in physical daily activity, muscle grip strength and ex vivo muscle maximal force production was observed in 25 compared to 10 month-old mice. The muscle anabolic response to a single protein meal showed increased muscle protein synthesis in young, but not in old mice, indicative to anabolic resistance. However, by increasing the protein content in meals, anabolic resistance could be overcome, similar as in human elderly. Additionally, aged mice showed higher fasted insulin and hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (=marker oxidative stress).This study shows clear characteristics of sarcopenia that coincide with anabolic resistance, insulin resistance and oxidative stress in 25 month-old C57/BL6 male mice, similar to human ageing. Furthermore, similar decline in muscle mass, strength and function was observed in this aged-mice-model. These observations offer potential for the future to explore in old mice the effects of interventions targeting sarcopenia.",

A total of 1003 papers were identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria. The highest level of evidence (Level II) was generated by three Phase II randomized controlled trials. These trials demonstrated the feasibility of computer based interactive or instructive video interventions however there was limited evidence to support their use for reduction of pain intensity and interference. Qualitative evidence demonstrated older people\u2019s willingness to use mobile technologies (iPhone or digital pen) to help manage their pain, however, the need of device-use training and connectedness with clinicians were highlighted.In conclusion, there is some evidence that integrating digital health technology into older peoples\u2019 pain self-management plan is feasible and acceptable. However, the provision of high-quality technological interventions informed by a thorough understanding of older people\u2019s digital technology pain management needs is required to ensure greater integration of this technology in clinical practice.",

Articles describing the development of criteria for PIM Use in Older Adults published in the last decade and which provided a list of medications that should be considered inappropriate were included. The searches were conducted on Pubmed/Medline for articles published from 1st of January 2006 to 31st of December 2015. We analyzed the medications/classes reported in all criteria, most common classes and how many indications each medication made.From 778 articles, 14 articles were included in our analysis (containing 14 different criteria). Europe was responsible for 8 criteria (57.2% of total) followed by Asia (3 criteria) and USA (2 criteria). More than 85% used a Delphi method. There were 729 different medications/classes reported in all criteria. Diazepam was included in all 14 criteria followed by amitriptyline (13 criteria) and doxepin (12 criteria). We found benzodiazepines, NSAIDs, antihistamines and antipsychotics were the most common drugs reported as potentially inappropriate for older persons.The present study systematically compiled all medications included in 14 different criteria published last decade. Benzodiazepines, NSAIDs, antihistamines and antipsychotics were the most common drugs reported as potentially inappropriate for older persons. These results could help health professionals and panel experts to plan future criteria.",

Two independent researchers assessed the eligibility of the articles. Quality of the articles was assessed using the Epidemiological Appraisal Instrument.The literature search yielded 540 articles, of which 32 met the study criteria and were included in the review (n\u00a0=\u00a036,076, age range: 50\u201383 years). Twenty-three (72%) studies used or adapted the Fried phenotype to measure frailty. The prevalence of frailty ranged from 7% in community-dwellers (CKD Stages 1\u20134) to 73% in a cohort of patients on haemodialysis. The incidence of frailty increased with reduced glomerular filtration rate. Frailty was associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization.Frailty is prevalent in patients with CKD and it is associated with an increased risk of adverse health outcomes. There are differences in the methods used to assess frailty and this hinders comparisons between studies.",

Despite this, little is known about the prevalence in different populations particularly community-based samples. This cross-sectional study evaluates the prevalence of frailty in a community-dwelling older adult population and describes a methodology to plan community-based interventions.A random sample of 1331 older adults, resident in the Lazio-Region of Italy, were screened by trained public health nurses (PHNs) by administering a validated questionnaire (the Functional Geriatric Evaluation questionnaire). Prevalence of frailty was calculated using the Final Synthetic Score derived from the questionnaire\u2019s Final Score. Variables associated with frailty were selected through univariate and multivariate statistical analysis.Prevalence of frail (FS\u00a0\u2265\u00a010,\u226450) and very frail (FS\u00a0<\u00a010) individuals was 13.9% and 7.6% respectively. Variables associated with frailty were age (older than 85 years), disability, living alone or the presence of a paid carer, lower education and neurological disorders like stroke, dementia, Parkinson disease and other neuropsychiatric diseases; Anaemia or cancer were also associated with a higher prevalence of frailty.The study provide a comprehensive picture of the prevalence of frailty and factors associated to this condition in community-dwelling older adults. On the basis of the study results, a plan of community-based services could address the needs of care of the elderly population. A trained team of PHNs may be the most appropriate personnel to carry out multidimensional frailty assessment in this setting.",

The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to assess the effects of a 12-week home-based intervention program carried out by lay volunteers on FOF in frail older adults.Thirty-nine participants were randomised to a physical training and nutrition (PTN) group and 41 participants to a social support (SOSU) group. In the PTN group, strength training and conversation about optimising nutrition were performed twice weekly, and the SOSU group received home visits without intervention. FOF and change of FOF were assessed using the Falls Efficacy Scale \u2013 International (FES-I). The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and maximum handgrip strength and their changes were also assessed.The mean FES-I score at baseline was 42.7 points and was significantly associated with the SPPB and PASE scores. The FES-I score significantly changed in the PTN group from 44.1 to 39.9 points over the course of the intervention. Twenty-seven percent of the participants showed a decreased FES-I score of at least 4 points. This decrease was associated with an increase in the SPPB score and an increase in handgrip strengthA 12-week structured physical training and nutrition intervention carried out by lay volunteers, which leads to an increase in physical activity and improved physical performance, can reduce FOF by about 10%.",

The Senior Fitness Test and the Short Form 36 Health Survey were used to measure FF and HRQoL, respectively. A canonical correlation analysis was conducted using seven fitness variables as predictors of eight HRQoL variables to examine the relationship between FF and HRQoL.The overall FF was positively correlated with the overall HRQoL in both men (canonical correlation\u00a0=\u00a00.350) and women (canonical correlation\u00a0=\u00a00.456). The up-and-go and 2-min step contributed the most to FF, and physical functioning contributed the most to HRQOL among men. Conversely, the up-and-go and 30-s chair stand contributed the most to FF, and physical functioning contributed the most to HRQoL in women.There were positive and moderate relationships between overall FF and overall HRQOL in older adults. The FF has a significant influence on HRQoL, particularly physical functioning. The main FF components influencing the relationship between FF and HRQoL in men are balance and agility and aerobic endurance, whereas in women they are balance and agility and lower extremity muscle strength. Results from this study facilitate comprehensively understanding the relationship between FF and HRQoL, and generating critical insight into HRQoL improvement from the perspective of FF enhancement.",

However, few studies have examined the influence of PRBT on health service utilisation, cognitive wellbeing and training modality acceptance or undertaken a cost benefit analysis. This project will investigate the broad scope benefits of PRBT participation among community-dwelling older Australians receiving Government supported aged care packages for their complex health care needs. Using a modified stepped-wedge design, 248 community-dwelling adults 65 years and older with some level of government support aged care have been randomised into the study. Those randomised to exercise undertake six months of twice weekly machine-based, moderate to high intensity, supervised PRBT, followed by a six month unsupervised, unsupported follow-up. Controls spend six months undertaking usual activities, before entering the PRBT and follow-up phases. Data are collected at baseline and after each of the six month phases. Measures include level of and change in health and care needs, body composition, muscle capacity, falls, sleep, quality of life, nutritional and mental health status. In addition, acceptance and engagement is determined through telephone and focus group interviews complementing a multi-model health cost benefit evaluation. It is hypothesised this study will demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of PRBT in improving primary and secondary health outcomes for older adults with aged care needs, and will support the value of this modality of exercise as an integral evidence-based service model of care.",

     "abstract": "This study aimed to compare the magnitude of knee muscle strength and static and dynamic balance change in response to 8 months of progressive RE and AE training in healthy community-dwelling older women. A secondary aim was to assess the relationship between muscle strength and balance changes (up and go test (UGT), one-leg stance test, and center of pressure measures). This study was a secondary analysis of longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial, a three-arm intervention study in older women (n\u00a0=\u00a071, mean age 69.0\u00a0y). The results suggest that both interventions elicited likely to almost certain improvements (using magnitude-based inference) in balance performance. Leg strength was improved after RE whereas it was unclear following AE. Improvements in strength were almost certainly moderate after RE and possibly trivial after AE, with very likely greater improvements following RE compared to AE. A large and significant negative correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.5; CI 90%: \u22120.7 to \u22120.2) was found between \u0394UGT and change in both knee extension and knee flexion strength after 8-month RE. In conclusion, our results showed that both types of training improve balance, but RE was also effective at improving leg strength. In addition, improvements in both knee extension and flexion strength after RE appear to make an important contribution to meaningful improvements in static and dynamic balance.",

Cognitive function was evaluated by a standardized test, social support was evaluated through latent class analysis (LCA). The LCA was run to obtain three subgroups of different Social Support Levels (SSL): low, medium, and high. Logistic regression models, stratified by age, were performed to analyze the association between SSL and cognitive function.For respondents ages 71\u201380 y/o, there was an inverse relationship with cognitive impairment for those with medium (OR 0.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.020) and high (OR 0.07, p\u00a0=\u00a00.000) SSL in comparison with low SSL. While social support helped to improve cognitive function in older adults aged 71\u201380, this same association was not observed in adults of other ages. Those younger than 70 y/o may not need such a strong support network as a result of being more self-sufficient. After 80, social networks were not enough to help diminish the negative impact of cognitive impairment.Social support could improve the cognitive function of adults ages 71 and 80; suggesting there could be a window of opportunity to improve cognitive functioning for this group.",

Multinomial logistic analysis was performed to identify individual factors associated with the occurrence and place of falls, and multilevel multinomial analysis to identify contextual effects (green areas, violence, presence of slums and income inequality).29% had a fall in the last 12 months, with 59% occurring in indoor spaces. Individuals who had outdoor falls were overall not statistically different from non-fallers; on the other hand, those who had the last fall indoor had worse health status. Moderate homicide rate was a factor associated with increased presence of indoor falls, compared with non-fallers.Our results describe the importance of falls, a common problem in active and community-dwelling older adults of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. Transforming outdoor spaces into walk-friendly areas is essential to allow socialization and autonomy with safety.

Multivariate logistic regression was performed examining the association of proposed factors with the occurrence of physical, financial, and psychological abuse.In the past 6 months, 15%, 20%, and 42% of respondents reported experiencing physical, financial, and psychological abuse by relatives with PD, respectively. All forms of abuse co-occur at statistically significant levels. There is variation among factors associated with physical, financial, and psychological abuse; however, all types are associated with greater use of limit-setting practices and either regular attendance of mental health treatment or use of medications.Efforts to prevent abuse of older persons may benefit from linking suspected/substantiated elder abusers with PD to mental health treatment. Older persons engaging in high levels of limit-setting practices towards relatives with PD may benefit from being offered support and guidance regarding how to set limits in ways less likely to escalate conflict.",

This study investigated whether simple timed up and go test (TUG) and unipedal stance test (UST) are effective in identifying people with an increased risk of fractures, femoral fractures, or admissions due to femoral fractures.Community-dwelling Korean older adults aged 66 years participated in the Korean National Screening Program for the Transitional Ages (n\u00a0=\u00a0557,648) between 2007 and 2010. Overall fractures, femoral fractures, and admissions due to femoral fracture during this period were outcome measures. The outcome measures were overall fractures, femoral fractures, and admissions due to femoral fracture after the health screening. The associations between inferior physical function test results and outcome measures were evaluated.A total of 523,502 subjects were followed-up for a mean period of 1.42 years, which resulted in 12,965 subjects with any fractures. Fracture data were retrieved from medical claims record. Subjects who performed poorly on one or both of the two physical function tests experienced higher number of overall fractures (aHR 1.21, 95% CI: 1.16\u20131.26), femoral fractures (aHR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.59\u20132.17), and admissions due to femoral fractures (aHR 1.85, 95% CI: 1.55\u20132.22) as compared to subjects with normal results on both tests. Combining TUG and UST was not superior to performing UST alone in predicting the increased risk of overall fractures (p\u00a0=\u00a00.347), femoral fractures (p\u00a0=\u00a00.402) or admissions due to femoral fractures (p\u00a0=\u00a00.774).Poor performance on physical performance tests is associated with a higher risk of overall fractures, femoral fractures and admissions due to femoral fractures.

Analyses were stratified by sex and age group (65\u201379, 80\u201389, 90\u201399, and 100+), and adjusted for a wide range of covariates.Compared with women who never reported perceived uselessness, results from adjusted models shows that women who always reported perceived uselessness had 42% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), 31% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and 24% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) higher risks of mortality in each of the three oldest age groups, respectively. These associations were only slightly attenuated when covariates were adjusted, but non-significant once baseline health was further controlled for. For men, compared with those who never reported perceived uselessness, the adjusted models for those who always reported perceived uselessness had 62% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), 62% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), 69% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and 25% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.1) higher risks of mortality in each of the four sequential age groups, respectively.

We investigated, if a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) decreased the anticholinergic drug score in a 4-year period. We used four different anticholinergic ranked lists to determine the anticholinergic score and to describe how the results differ depending on the list used.We analyzed data from population-based intervention study, in which a random sample of 1000 persons aged \u226575 years were randomized to either an intervention group or a control group. Those in the intervention group underwent CGA including medication assessment annually between 2004 and 2007. Current medication use was assessed annually.

Compared to individuals without multimorbidity, the risk of death was 1.73 (95%CI: 1.41; 2.13) and 2.72 (95%CI: 1.81; 4.08) for people with 2 or more and 3 or more morbidities, respectively. Heterogeneity between studies was high (96.5%). The sample, adjustment and follow-up modified the associations. Only nine estimates performed adjustment which included demographic, socioeconomic and behaviour variables. Disabilities appear to mediate the effect of multimorbidity on mortality.Multimorbidity was associated with an increase in risk of death. Multimorbidity measurement standardization is needed to produce more comparable estimates. Adjusted analysis which includes potential confounders might contribute to better understanding of causal relationships between multimorbidity and mortality.",

The PACE-Lift primary care-based walking intervention for 60\u201375 year-olds used a structured, theoretically grounded intervention with pedometers, accelerometers, handbooks and support from practice nurses trained in behaviour change techniques. It demonstrated an objective increase in walking at 3 and 12 months. We investigated the experiences of intervention participants who did (and did not) increase their walking, in order to explore facilitators to increased walking.Semi-structured telephone interviews used an interview schedule with a purposive sample of 30 intervention participants, 19 who had objectively increased their walking over the previous year and 11 who had not. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed and coded independently by researchers to generate a thematic coding framework.Both groups confirmed that walking was an appropriate PA for people of \u2018their age\u2019. The majority of those with increased walking participated in the trial as a couple, were positive about individualised goal-setting, developed strategies for maintaining their walking, and had someone to walk with. Non-improvers reported their attempts to increase walking were difficult because of lack of social support and were less positive about the intervention\u2019s behaviour change components.Walking is an acceptable and appropriate PA intervention for older people. The intervention\u2019s goal-setting components were important for those who increased their walking. Mutual support between partners participating as a couple and having someone to walk with also facilitated increased walking.",

Three different social security benefits were identified and their effects on the long-term care services for disabled older people were explored.The overall proportions of disabled older people who have only limited or no available or affordable LTC services were remarkably high, especially for those who have moderate or no social security benefits. Compared to those who are entitled to generous social security benefits, older people who have no social security benefits are 18.45 times more likely to be unable to afford health care expenses.The findings imply that policy makers in China could focus on the LTC needs for the social security and socioeconomically disadvantaged (who have limited or no social security benefits and in low household income) disabled older people which could reduce the gap between them and those who are entitled to generous social security benefits.",

Disability was defined as self-reporting a lot of difficulty or complete inability to carry out one or more ADL tasks.

Hospitalization and emergency department visits was assessed as a dichotomous variable (any or none), respectively.An absence of available help for ADL disability was reported in 16.6% of disabled older adults. Disabled older adults reporting an absence of help were more likely to be female.

Quality of standing balance was assessed by measuring the center of pressure (COP) sway with a pressure platform. Measurements were performed under single task (orthostatic position) and dual task (orthostatic position while performing a verbal fluency task) conditions.The mean age of the participants was 79.1(\u00b17.3)\u00a0years and 76.1% were women. Older age was associated with an increased COP sway, mainly in the medial/lateral (ML) direction. Most COP sway parameters were higher under dual task conditions than under single task. After controlling for the effect of the number of words enunciated in dual task conditions, only the differences in COP sway parameters in the ML direction remained significant. There was no significant interaction between age group (65\u201379; \u226580 years) and condition, which indicates that differences in COP sway caused by performing a secondary task were similar for younger and for older participants.Age did not seem to influence significantly the decline in the quality of standing balance triggered by performing a concurrent cognitive task. However, older age was consistently associated with poorer standing balance, both in single and in dual task conditions. Therefore, performing a secondary task may lead older individuals to reach their postural stability limits and, consequently, to fall.",

     "abstract": "Falls are common in the older UK population and associated costs to the NHS are high. Systematic reviews suggest that home exercise and group-based exercise interventions, which focus on progressively challenging balance and increasing strength, can reduce up to 42% of falls in those with a history of falls. The evidence is less clear for those older adults who are currently at low risk of falls.ProAct65+, a large, cluster-randomised, controlled trial, investigated the effectiveness of a home exercise programme (Otago Exercise Programme (OEP)) and a group-based exercise programme (Falls Management Exercise (FaME)) compared to usual care (UC) at increasing moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA). This paper examines the trial\u2019s secondary outcomes; the effectiveness of the interventions at reducing falls and falls-related injuries.1256 community-dwelling older adults (aged 65\u00a0+\u00a0) were recruited through GP practices in two sites (London and Nottingham). Frequent fallers (\u22653 falls in last year) and those with unstable medical conditions were excluded, as were those already reaching the UK Government recommended levels of physical activity (PA) for health.Baseline assessment (including assessment of health, function and previous falls) occurred before randomisation; the intervention period lasted 24 weeks and there was an immediate post-intervention assessment; participants were followed up every six months for 24 months. Falls data were analysed using negative binomial modelling.Falls data were collected prospectively during the intervention period by 4-weekly diaries (6 in total). Falls recall was recorded at the 3-monthly follow-ups for a total of 24 months. Balance was measured at baseline and at the end of the intervention period using the Timed Up & Go and Functional Reach tests. Balance confidence (CONFbal), falls risk (FRAT) and falls self-efficacy (FES-I) were measured by questionnaire at baseline and at all subsequent assessment points.294 participants (24%) reported one or two falls in the previous year. There was no increase in falls in either exercise group compared to UC during the intervention period (resulting from increased exposure to risk). The FaME arm experienced a significant reduction in injurious falls compared to UC (incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.55, 95% CI 0.31, 0.96; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and this continued during the 12 months after the end of the intervention (IRR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54, 0.99; p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). There was also a significant reduction in the incidence of all falls (injurious and non-injurious) in the FaME arm compared with UC (IRR 0.74, 95% CI 0.55, 0.99; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) in the 12 month period following the cessation of the intervention. There was a non-significant reduction in the incidence of all falls in the OEP arm compared with UC (IRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.53, 1.09; p\u00a0=\u00a00.14) in the 12 months following the cessation of the intervention. The effects on falls did not persist at the 24 months assessment in either exercise arm. However, when those in the FaME group who continued to achieve 150\u00a0min of MVPA per week into the second post-intervention year were compared to those in the FaME group who did not maintain their physical activity, there was a significant reduction in falls incidence (IRR\u00a0=\u00a00.49, 95% CI 0.30, 0.79; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). CONFbal was significantly improved at 12 months post intervention in both intervention arms compared with UC. There were no significant changes in any of the functional balance measures, FES-I or FRAT, between baseline and the end of the intervention period.Community-dwelling older adults who joined an exercise intervention (FaME) aimed at increasing MVPA did not fall more during the intervention period, fell less and had fewer injurious falls in the 12 months after cessation of the intervention. However, 24 months after cessation of exercise, the beneficial effects of FaME on falls reduction ceased, except in those who maintained higher levels of MVPA. OEP exercise appears less effective at reducing falls in this functionally more able population of older adults.",

Life satisfaction was measured using a sum score of satisfaction with thirteen domains. Using a cumulative deficit approach, frailty was constructed from fifty-two variables and social vulnerability was derived from thirty-five variables.Frailty was negatively associated with life satisfaction.

     "abstract": "Hiking at moderate altitude is a popular outdoor activity in seniors. Acute exercise or altitude can diminish balance performance. Thus, the present study examined the combined effects of altitude and walking on static and dynamic balance.Thirty-six healthy seniors (age: 62 (SD: 4) y; BMI: 25 (5) kg/m2) were examined on three days. Firstly, walking velocity was determined at 85% of the first ventilatory threshold (VT1). Therefore, a ramp walking test on a treadmill was completed. On day two or three, a 40-minute treadmill walk under sea level or normobaric hypoxia (2600m) was performed using a random, double-blind study design. Balance performance was assessed on a force-plate during single leg stance with eyes open (SLEO, 10\u00a0s on a force-plate) immediately before and after walking. Spatio-temporal gait characteristics were collected during walking at 5 and 35\u00a0min.Condition\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0time interaction effects were not found for either parameter (0.13\u00a0<\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.60; 0.007<\u00a0\u03b7p2\u00a0<\u00a00.07). Only time effects were observed for cadence (\u22121.5%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, \u03b7p2\u00a0=\u00a00.29), stride time (+2.3%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007, \u03b7p2\u00a0=\u00a00.28), and temporal gait variability (+22.6%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, \u03b7p2\u00a0=\u00a00.16).

Subseqent post hoc testing revealed difference between hypoxia and normoxia at 35\u00a0min (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and between 5 and 35\u00a0min testing during hypoxia and normoxia (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Alterations of cadence, stride time, and temporal gait variability might be attributed to fatigue-induced changes of temporal gait adjustments. Normobaric hypoxia did not acutely impair gait patterns. We assume that demanding postural standing tasks that require more central control may be affected to a greater extent by altitude exposure.",

     "abstract": "The prevalence of osteoporosis has continuously increased over the past decades and it is set to increase substantially as life expectancy rises steadily. Fragility or osteoporotic fractures of the pelvis often occur after low energy falls e.g. from standing, however, some patients present with assumed insufficiency fractures of the pelvis without a previous trauma. Osteoporotic fractures impose a tremendous economic burden and these fractures deserve attention as they lead to a decrease in mobility with an increase in dependency and are associated with a high rate of mortality. To date, little is known about potential risk factors for pelvic insufficiency fractures. Furthermore, information on clinical outcome is scarce.In view of this rather limited knowledge, we aimed to identify potential risk factors for pelvic insufficiency fractures and to collect information on their short- and long-term outcomes.Files of all consecutive patients admitted between January 2010 and December 2013 for a pelvic insufficiency fracture were enrolled in this study. Pelvic fractures that occurred on tumorous bone or after high-energy trauma were excluded. Fractures of the pelvis included all pelvic bones except the coccyx. For all patients, we recorded clinical and biological parameters available from their medical history. For comparison, the same biological and clinical parameters were evaluated in an age matched control group of 1083 patients aged over 70 who were admitted to our orthopaedic department to undergo knee or hip arthroplasty.The statistical analyses used or Fisher test for percentages comparison, 2-tailed t-tests and Mann Whitney for mean comparison. To determine what factors are predictors and what factors are confounders of pelvic insufficiency fractures, multivariate linear regression analysis using the fracture as a continuous variable was performed.Ninety-three patients with a pelvic insufficiency fracture were identified. Following the Rommens and Hofmann classification for fragility fractures of the pelvis (FFP), 51 were FFP Type Ia, 26 were FFP Type IIb lesions and 26 were FFP Type IIc. Osteoporosis was found to be significantly associated with pelvic insufficiency fractures (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), as was hypertension (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036), diabetes (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021), vitamin D deficiency (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), hypocalcaemia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and nicotine abuse (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0012) after adjustment for possible confounders in the multivariate linear regression analysis. Comparing the autonomous state before and after pelvic fracture, a high loss of autonomy was observed. Patients needing daily assistance nearly doubled their number. Overall mortality was high (20%).In conclusion, this study showed multiple risk factors for pelvic insufficiency fractures. Some, like vitamin D deficiency, can benefit easy preventive measures. Outcome of conservative therapy is poor, with loss of social and physical independence and autonomy. The mortality rate is high. Efforts should be made in preventing pelvic insufficiency fractures. All patients should be treated for the severe osteoporosis being associated with these fracture type.",

A stepwise logistic regression was applied to determine the best model to predict SVaD.The SVaD group showed a higher frequency of depression, whereas the bvFTD group had a higher frequency of elation, aberrant motor behavior and appetite/eating disorders. Regarding NPI subscores, the bvFTD group had greater severity of elation, apathy, disinhibition, aberrant motor behavior and appetite/eating disorders, whereas SVaD did not have significantly higher subscores in any domains. The most predictive models that tend to find suggestions of SVaD, as opposed to bvFTD, are as follows: (1) the presence of depression and the absence of appetite/eating disorders, (2) higher NPI subscores of depression and lower NPI subscores of irritability and aberrant motor behavior.Apart from apathy, SVaD differed from bvFTD in that negative symptoms were more common in SVaD than bvFTD, whereas positive symptoms were predominant in bvFTD compared to SVaD.",

However, no previous study has examined the relationship between social class and life satisfaction in terms of a disparity between subjective and objective social status.To investigate the relationship between differences in subjective and objective social class and life satisfaction.Data from the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging with 8252 participants aged 45 or older was used. Life satisfaction was measured by the question, \u201cHow satisfied are you with your quality of life?\u201d The main independent variable was differences in objective (income and education) and subjective social class, which was classified according to nine categories (ranging from high-high to low-low). This association was investigated by linear mixed model due to two waves data nested within individuals.Lower social class (income, education, subjective social class) was associated with dissatisfaction. The impact of objective and subjective social class on life satisfaction varied according to the level of differences in objective and subjective social class. Namely, an individual\u2019s life satisfaction declined as objective social classes decreased at the same level of subjective social class (i.e., HH, MH, LH). In both dimensions of objective social class (education and income), an individual\u2019s life satisfaction declined as subjective social class decreased by one level (i.e., HH, HM, HL).Our findings indicated that social supports is needed to improve the life satisfaction among the population aged 45 or more with low social class. The government should place increased focus on policies that encourage not only the life satisfaction of the Korean elderly with low objective social class, but also subjective social class.",

Stress for health, finance, and family members\u2019 related issues were all cross-sectionally associated with concurrent depressive symptoms for men and women (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Increased/constant-high health stress was positively associated with subsequent depressive symptoms in both genders (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Constantly high job stress and increased stress over family members\u2019 problems were associated with higher likelihood of subsequent depressive symptoms in men (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Constantly high/increased financial stress and relationship strain with family members were positively associated with subsequent depressive symptoms in women (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The results suggest that stress for health, job, finance, and family members-related issues are unequally associated with depressive symptoms among Taiwanese men and women aged 50 years and over. Changes of health stress even reduced are significantly associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. Long-term job stress and increased stress over family members\u2019 problems increase occurrences of men\u2019s depressive symptoms, while increased/long-term financial stress and relationship-strain with family members increase occurrences of women\u2019s depressive symptoms.

The TFI is a self-report questionnaire for measuring frailty, developed from an integral approach of frailty, including physical, psychological, and social domains.Reference values were provided for men and women separately, as a function of age. We found associations of all socio-demographic variables with frailty, also after controlling for the effects of age. These associations held for both sexes and for big cities as wells as more rural areas. For instance, the effect of age was large for total and physical frailty, women were more frail than men, and some very large average frailty differences between the ethnic groups were found, with autochthon people having the lowest frailty score.In conclusion, this study offers reference values of the TFI by socio-demographic characteristics and explains frailty using these characteristics. This information will support researchers, policymakers and health care professionals in interpreting scores of the TFI, which may guide their efforts to reduce frailty and its adverse outcomes.",

Beers (2012) and STOPP (2008) criteria were utilized to identify PIMs. Data on age, sex, admission and discharge dates, diagnoses, and medications prescribed were obtained from medical records. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine patient variables related with the prescription of PIMs.Using Beers criteria, 375 PIMs were identified in 198 patients. 32% of these patients were prescribed one PIM, 20% were prescribed two PIMs, and 48% were prescribed more than two PIMs. Using STOPP criteria, 148 PIMs were identified in 120 patients. 41% of these patients were prescribed one PIM, 51% were prescribed two PIMs, and 8% were prescribed more than two PIMs. An association between PIM prescribing and polypharmacy was detected with both criteria. After adjusting for confounding variables, the prescription of Beers-identified PIMs was significantly associated with patients older than 80 (OR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.13\u20137.89) and with length of hospital stay of more than 15\u00a0days (OR: 2.78; 95% CI: 1.20\u20136.44).These two criteria showed that the prescription of PIMs is prevalent in hospitalized elderly patients.

Echocardiography including right heart parameters was performed within a cardiovascular follow-up of 688 subjects.Non-obtainability of right heart B-mode data was rather not a consequence of accompanying cardiac diseases or risk factors but of a more obese body composition. Mean values of right heart measurements of our subpopulation of subjects without evidence for structural cardiac disease were continuously higher than those of the guidelines (e.g. mean right ventricular end diastolic area 23.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6\u00a0cm2 (males), 20.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.0\u00a0cm2 (females)).

We systematically screened the barriers, motivators, and facilitators of PA participation in dementia patients, complementing previous analyses of quantitative correlates of PA in community-dwelling dementia patients.Systematic searches yielded 78 potential studies of which seven met the eligibility criteria including 39 dementia patients and 36 caregivers (33 spouses and three daughters).We identified 35 barriers, 26 motivators, and 21 facilitators related to PA. We reduced these factors to six themes within the social-ecological model. Prominent barriers to PA were physical and mental limitations and difficulties with guidance and organization of PA by caregivers. Motivators included the motivation to maintain physical and mental health and participate in preferred PA options. Facilitators included strategies to avoid health problems, providing support and guidance for PA, and access to convenient and personalized PA options.The emerging picture suggests that dementia patients\u2019 PA participation will increase if service providers become familiar with the health benefits of PA, the characteristics of PA programs, methods of delivery, and the concepts of how such programs can be personalized to and synchronized with patients\u2019 individual needs.",

We measured salivary human herpesvirus (HHV)-6 and -7 DNA levels and the Chalder fatigue scale (CFS) to assess levels of fatigue; we also measured the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale, Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly, Zarit Caregiver Burden Interview, Mini-Mental State Examination, Assessment of Motor and Process Skills, and Dementia Behavior Disturbance Scale.For CG, the salivary HHV-6 DNA levels and CFS scores were significantly higher than those in NCG. The salivary HHV-6 DNA levels in CG were significantly correlated with depressive symptoms, the cognitive function of the patients, and the activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living (ADL/IADL) abilities of the patients. The CFS scores in CG significantly correlated with caregiver burden, depression symptoms, leisure physical activity, the number of other family caregivers, and the hours spent for caregiving per week, as well as with behavior disturbances and ADL/IADL abilities.The salivary HHV-6 DNA levels may be added as a new biomarker for caregiver exhaustion. We concluded that fatigue assessments should be performed by not only a questionnaire, such as the CFS, but also by a biomarker search, such as HHV-6, when estimating the caregiver burden for family caregivers of people with dementia.",

Little is known about age-related changes in the motor control of gait (gait variability) during challenging walking conditions, such as slower and faster pace walking.The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of challenging walking conditions (slower and faster speeds) on gait variability in younger and older adults.This study was a cross-sectional, observational design.Forty younger (mean age\u00a0=\u00a026.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0years) and 111 community-dwelling older adults (mean age\u00a0=\u00a077.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0years), independent in ambulation, were studied. Gait characteristics were collected using a computerized walkway (GaitMat II\u2122). Step length, step width, step time, swing time, stance time and double support time variability were derived as the standard deviation of all steps across the 4 passes.Compared to younger, older adults had a significant change in their gait variability from usual to slower in step width (-0.006\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.003), step time (0.028\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.006), swing time (0.023\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004), stance time (0.042\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.008), and double support time (0.024\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005).

     "abstract": "Frailty is a common syndrome among elderly and sensory decline may exacerbate functional decline. The hand function, the manual dexterity, the performance of the daily living skills and the social interactions are determined, in a large degree, by sensory integrity. However, hand tactile sensory deterioration has been little explored in frailty. We performed a cross sectional observational study with 181 of institutionalized elders. From the initial sample we selected 50 subjects (68\u201399 years) who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our goals were (1) to analyse the relationship between tactile discrimination (TD) of the hand, avoidance behaviours and attitudes towards social touch (BATST) and phenotype frailty criteria (unintentional weight loss, self-perception of exhaustion, decrease grip strength \u2212 GS, slow walking speed, low level of physical activity), (2) to explore whether other variables can contribute to explain the differences between pre-frail and frail elders. The results showed that increasing age is related to decline of TD of the hand (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021) and to decrease in GS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025); women have significantly lower level of GS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001); TD decrease is correlated with higher avoidance BATST (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000) and with lower GS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000); Lower GS corresponds to more avoidance BATST (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Hand TD also can differentiate frail and pre-frail elderly subjects in this sample (p\u00a0=\u00a00.037). Decreased TD of the hand may have implications on the functionality and on interpersonal relationships. TD of the hand also explains frailty levels in this sample. Hand TD should be used in assessment and intervention protocols in pre-frail and frail elders.",

The aim of this study was to explore knowledge of dementia (KOD) and to find the determinants of KOD among three groups: older adults with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia.A representative nationwide sample of 6141 Korean elders aged 65 years or older participated in face-to-face interviews and answered 14 questions pertaining to general information, etiology, symptoms, and treatment of dementia. Stepwise multiple regressions and path analyses probed the relationships between various sociodemographic variables and KOD.The percentage of correct responses was only 62%. The item \u2018A person who remembers things that happened in the past does not have dementia\u2019 was answered correctly (false) by only 24.8\u201327% of the respondents in all groups. Older adults with normal cognition had higher KOD scores than those with MCI or dementia. In the normal-cognition group, KOD scores were higher among highly educated, younger, and literate women with no depression and a family history of dementia. In contrast with the determinants in the normal-cognition group, only the ability to read and write predicted KOD scores in the dementia group.Efforts to enhance KOD in elder adults are needed. Public education regarding the differences between dementia and healthy aging may increase KOD among normal elders and those with MCI. Among elders with dementia, educational materials that do not require literacy may be more helpful in increasing KOD with the aim of preventing treatment delay.",

Staff completed self-report measures of organizational climate, self-efficacy, and strains in caring for residents with dementia.Indirect effects analyses using bootstrapping indicated that self-efficacy of staff mediated the association between the organizational climate variables of autonomy, trust, support, pressure, and staff strain.The findings of this study emphasize that the aged care sector needs to target organizational climate variables that enhance the self-efficacy of staff, and that this in turn, can help ameliorate the strain experienced by staff caring for residents experiencing dementia.",

We conducted a prospective study with a multifactorial approach based on the population-based longitudinal Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA). A total of 772 Swedes (mean age at baseline 69.7 years, range 46\u2013103, 59.8% females) answered a postal questionnaire about physical and psychological health, personality and socioeconomic factors. During nine years of follow-up, information on hospitalizations and associated diagnoses were obtained from national registers. Results show that 484 persons (63%) had at least one hospital admission during the follow-up period. The most common causes of admission were cardiovascular diseases (25%) and tumors (22%). Cox proportional hazard regression models controlling for age, sex and dependency within twin pairs, showed that higher age (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.02, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and more support from relatives (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.09, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028) were associated with increased risk of hospitalization, while marital status (unmarried (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.75, p\u00a0=\u00a00.033) and widow/widower (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.69, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001)) and support from friends (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.93, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) were associated with lower risk of hospitalization.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of the TPES on maximum tongue pressure and peak amplitude of submental muscle activity in older individuals.27 older individuals (mean 73 years) performed a 4-week TPES. The exercise program was adapted to a home-based and self-administered procedure.

The TPES, a combining exercise, was possible because two exercises had common physiological events. The TPES was a more innovative and efficient approach than the tongue strengthening exercise alone. In addition, older individuals were able to perform the swallowing exercise at home and by themselves with little assistance.

The distribution of mobility disability was significantly different at the five study sites (ranged from 19.8% at Kingston, Canada to 50.7% at Tirana, Albania, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After adjusting for covariates, those with high and moderate FoF had about 3 times (95% CI: 2.59\u20133.83) and 2.5 times (95% CI: 1.99\u20132.91) higher risk of mobility disability, respectively, compared to those with no/low FoF.FoF was significantly associated with risk of mobility disability across the sites. The strength of this relationship appears to be different between the five sites.",

Healthy young and older, community dwelling adults performed three same elevation object transport tasks and two multiple elevation object transport tasks under two self-selected speeds, self-paced and fast-paced. Dynamic postural stability and movement variability was quantified by whole-body center of mass motion. Older adults demonstrated significant decrements in frontal plane stability during the multiple elevation tasks while exhibiting the same movement variability as their younger counterparts, regardless of task speed. Interestingly, older adults did not exhibit a tradeoff in maneuverability in favour of maintaining stability throughout the tasks, as has previously been reported. In conclusion, the multi-planar, ecologically relevant tasks employed in the current study were specific enough to elucidate decrements in dynamic stability, and thus may be useful for assessing fall risk in older adults with suspected postural instability.",

     "abstract": "The objective of this study is to examine the agreement between two commonly used frailty measurements (frailty index and phenotype) and their associations with falls and overnight hospitalizations in a community-based population.Data was collected from 1663 elderly adults (aged 70\u201384 years) from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Ageing study, a two-arm cohort conducted in Rugao, China. Items concerning the frailty index and phenotype, falls and overnight hospitalizations were collected.The Kappa agreement examining three levels of these two frailty measurements was 0.310 (95% CI: 0.277\u20130.343) according to the frailty index cut-off developed by Hoover et al. Both frailty measurements were significantly associated with falls and overnight hospitalizations. For instance, compared with the frailty index defined non-frail participants, their pre-frail and frail counterparts had significantly increased risks for falls, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.69 (95% CI: 1.17\u20132.43) and 2.87 (95% CI: 1.93\u20134.28), respectively. When the two frailty measurements were simultaneously included in the models, significant associations were also observed. More importantly, a sub-analysis in participants who were categorized as robust by frailty phenotype revealed that frail participants (frailty index\u00a0>\u00a00.21) still had increased risks for falls (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.35, 95% CI: 1.24\u20134.46) and overnight hospitalizations (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.56, 95% CI: 1.05\u20136.23) compared with their non-frail counterparts.Common characteristics and complementarity existed in the frailty index and phenotype in the elderly Chinese population. Additional consideration of the frailty index when applying frailty phenotype should be undertaken. The findings provide preliminary but crucial clues for future studies on frailty.",

A comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed at home by trained nurses. The prevalence of health and functional indicators, as well as the distribution of people among successful ageing, frailty, and disability, were described by age group (70\u201379, 80\u201389, 90+) and sex.Compared to their younger counterparts, people aged 90 years and over were more likely to experience functional limitations, sensory impairment, cognitive impairment, poor mood, and frailty. One third of the nonagenarians needed help in at least one basic activity of daily living and 25% met the frailty criteria. In contrast, the prevalence of most chronic diseases did not increase after ninety. Successful ageing concerned 9% of the oldest old. Women were less likely to experience successful ageing and more likely to be frail or dependent.This study shows the diversity of health states in very old age and points out that one quarter of the people aged 90 and over said frail are likely to take advantage of preventive actions of disability.",

Hence, this study determined the relationship among socio-demographics, spirituality, and QoL of Filipino older adults in a community and institutional setting.A predictive-correlational study among 200 randomly-selected community-dwelling and institutionalized older adults was conducted, with a 99% power and a medium effect size. Data were collected using a three-part questionnaire from September to November 2015. The questionnaire was composed of the robotfoto, Spirituality Assessment Scale, and modified Older People\u2019s Quality of Life which assessed socio-demographics, spirituality, and QoL.Analysis showed that institutionalization in a nursing home positively and negatively affected spirituality and QoL, generating an acceptable model (\u03c72/df\u00a0=\u00a02.12, RMSEA\u00a0=\u00a00.08, and CFI\u00a0=\u00a00.95).

This understanding provides impetus in evaluating and refining geriatric healthcare programs, policies, and protocols to render individualized, holistic care in a socially-cohesive environment among older adults.",

This study aims to analyze the impact of an individual reminiscence program in a group of older persons with cognitive decline living in nursing homes on the dimensions of cognition, autobiographical memory, mood, behavior and anxiety. A two-group pre-test and post-test design with single blinded assessment was conducted. Forty-one participants were randomized to an experimental group (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a021). The first group attended five weekly individual reminiscence sessions. Changes in the outcome measures were examined for cognition (Montreal Cognitive Assessment; Autobiographical Memory Test), behavior (Alzheimer Disease Assessment Subscale Non-Cog) and emotional status (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia; Geriatric Depression Scale, and Geriatric Anxiety Inventory). Participants attending reminiscence sessions exhibited better outcomes compared to the control group in cognition, anxiety and depression (p<0.001), and presented a higher number of retrieved autobiographical events, specificity of evoked memories and positive valence of events (p<0.001), and also presented lower latency time for recalling events, and lower negative recalled events (p<0.01). This study supports the potential value of reminiscence therapy in improving the recall of autobiographical memory. Reminiscence therapy can be helpful to maintain or improve cognitive function, decrease anxiety and manage depressive symptoms and altered behavior, but further investigation is needed to clarify long-term effects.",

The aim of this study was to assess the validity and reliability of the Depression in Old Age Scale (DIA-S) as a self-report screening tool for depressive symptoms in Iranian elders.The population sample was consisted of 210 older subjects admitted to Hamadan adult day care centers. The DIA-S and a socio-demographic questionnaire were used to gather the data. Concurrent and convergent validity were assessed by Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), and Abbreviated Mental Test score (AMTs), respectively. Measures for internal consistency were calculated with Cronbach's alpha. Factor structure of DIA-S was evaluated by principal component analysis, using varimax rotation with Kaiser normalization. Test-retest reliability was carried out using re-administration DIA-S to 24 participants after a gap of 16\u00a0days. Independent t-test and ANOVA were used to assessing significance of differences across demographic groups.The mean score of DIA-S was 3.69 (SD: 1.92, Range: 1\u20139). The Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 for DIA-S score was 0.821, indicating a high degree of internal consistency and homogeneity between the DIA-S items. Test-retest correlation on the 24 patients showed excellent results (ranging from 0.748 to 0.946). Factor analysis revealed one component that confirmed the theoretical construction of the scale. Based on the results, statistically significantly higher DIA-S scores with lower incomes were found.The DIA-S is a valid and reliable self-report screening tool for depressive symptoms in Iranian geriatric population and may be used in clinical and epidemiological studies.",

The load pattern (maximum load, rate of load production, and stepping-up time) during ascending a 30\u00a0cm step at maximum speed was measured, using a step up platform that measures the load at the lower and upper level. Physical function, including hip and knee extensor strength and performance on the vertical jump test, one-legged stance test, timed \u201cUp & Go\u201d (TUG) test, and stepping test were measured.Pearson\u2019s correlation analysis showed that stepping-up time was correlated with the maximum load at the lower level (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.51), but not with the maximum load at the upper level. A multiple regression analysis showed that hip extensor strength and performance on the vertical jump, TUG, and stepping tests were significant determinants of the load pattern during stepping-up motion in the elderly women.Our study revealed that rapid stepping-up ability was more closely related to the maximum load during push-off at the lower level rather than that during weight loading on the upper level, and that the load pattern during stepping-up motion in elderly women was associated with various physical functions such as the hip extensor strength, leg muscle power, dynamic balance function, and agility.",

Sepsis was induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Blood specimens and biopsies of tibialis anterior muscle and diaphragm were obtained at 24\u00a0h post CLP.Up-regulation of gamma and alpha 7 nAChRs was detected in both sham and septic groups; however, this response was more robust in septic animals.

The impact of the variability in physical activity, physical fitness, body composition, and chronic health conditions (co-morbidities) on the independence of older adults, especially over time, is seldom examined. This study aims to analyze quantitatively the impact of baseline values and changes in physical activity, physical fitness, body composition, and co-morbidities on the physical independence of community-dwelling, older adults over a 5-year period. Data from 106 and 85 community-dwelling adults (\u226560 years) were collected at baseline and after five years, respectively. Linear regression selected the main predictors of changes in physical independence as follows: the baseline physical independence (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.032, R2\u00a0=\u00a09.9%) and co-morbidities (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.191, R2\u00a0=\u00a06.3%) and the changes in co-morbidities (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.244, R2\u00a0=\u00a010.8%), agility (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.288, R2\u00a0=\u00a06.7%), aerobic endurance (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.007, R2\u00a0=\u00a03.2%), and walking expenditure (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.001, R2\u00a0=\u00a05.1%) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

We conduct a cross-sectional study in two areas in the South-east of France (Savoie and Is\u00e8re). An anonymized survey was sent by e-mail and/or post in May 2008 to all GPs with a large practice. Reminder letters were sent to GPs who hadn't answered between June and July 2008. Potentials barriers were measured by dichotomous scale. On GPs characteristics (socio-demographic, knowledge, attitude and practice), a multiple logistic regression was performed to identify others factors affecting falls screening. 493 questionnaires were analyzed (26.8%). 65.3% of respondents considered annual screening for falls to be useful, though only 28.8% of them implemented it each year and 9.3% every two to five years. Barriers to achieving annual screening included patient selecting (56.3%), forgetting to screen (26.6%), unsuitable working conditions (18.5%), lack of time (13.3%), of knowledge (13.3%), or of financial compensation (11.1%). Perception of the usefulness of annual screening for falls (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.38 (2.07\u201314.08); p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), satisfaction with medical care for falls (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.34 (1.09\u20131.65); p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and increased consultation time (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.65 (1.37\u20135.13); p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), were found to have a significant impact on the implementation of annual screening for falls.

The sample consisted of 716 residents, who were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Pneumonia diagnosis was based on clinical conditions documented in medical records. Physical functioning was measured by Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Longitudinal associations between pneumonia and physical functioning were explored using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE).Of 716 participants, 145 (20%) had one or more pneumonia events during 12 months follow-up. Mean age of the participants was 86.0 (SD\u00a0=\u00a07.4)\u00a0years, and 76% of them were female. Overall, participants had relatively low levels of physical functioning at baseline (Mean ADL\u00a0=\u00a02.4 out of 6, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.8).

     "abstract": "Successfully identifying older adults with a high risk of falling can be complicated, time consuming and not feasible in daily medical practice. This study compared the effectiveness of the Minimal Chair Height Standing Ability Test (MCHSAT) and 5-repetition sit-to-stand tst (5R-STS) as fall risk-screening instruments for the elderly.167 community-dwelling older adults (mean age\u00a0=\u00a083.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3\u00a0years) were interviewed for demographics, fall history, cognition, and mobility status. MCHSAT performance was assessed using a chair whose seat height was modifiable by increments of 5\u00a0cm, starting at 47\u00a0cm and lowering after each successful attempt. 5R-STS performance was assessed by recording the time it took to rise and sit back down five consecutive times from a chair of 47\u00a0cm high. Operating Receiving Characteristic (ROC) curves and Area under the Curve (AUC) were calculated for each test as well as for sub-groups of participants classified based on medical comorbidities (e.g. cardiac disease/stroke, lower limb arthritis).The MCHSAT and 5R-STS were equally effective fall-risk screening instruments for the overall population (AUC (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.72 (0.63\u20130.82) and 0.73(0.64\u20130.81) respectively). The 5R-STS was more effective than the MCHSAT for participants suffering from lower limb arthritis (AUC (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.81(0.70\u20130.92) and 0.71(0.58\u20130.85) respectively) while the opposite was true for participants with a history of cardiac disease or stroke (AUC (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.59 (0.44\u20130.80) and 0.65 (0.47\u20130.84) respectively).Due to their simplicity and quick administration time, the MCHSAT and 5R-STS are equally suitable for implementation in clinical settings.",

     "abstract": "Strategies to prevent or delay nursing home admission in individuals with cognitive impairment are urgently needed. We hypothesized that physical inactivity, not consuming alcohol (as opposed to moderate alcohol use), and having a history of smoking predict nursing home admission among individuals with normal cognitive function, but these behavioral factors would have attenuated associations with nursing home admission among individuals with impaired cognition.We performed a prospective cohort study among 7631 Health and Retirement Study participants aged 65+ at baseline. Baseline dementia risk (high versus low, based on brief psychometric assessments and proxy reports) and modifiable risk factors (physical inactivity, ever smoking, and not consuming alcohol) were used to predict nursing home admission in pooled logistic regression models. We evaluated whether estimated effects of modifiable factors varied by dementia risk, comparing both relative and absolute effects using interaction terms between dementia risk and each modifiable risk factor.Low dementia probability was associated with lower nursing home admission risk (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.49; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.59). Physical inactivity (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.27; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.41), ever smoking (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.12; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.25), and not consuming alcohol (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.28; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.45) predicted increased relative risk of nursing home admission regardless of cognitive status. The relative effects of modifiable risk factors were similar for those with low and high dementia risk.Although cognitive impairment associated with incipient dementia strongly predicts nursing home admission, this risk can be partially ameliorated with modifiable risk factors such as physical activity.",

Here, we explored the association between serum CTSB and aging-related subclinical cardiovascular and renal status in a healthy Chinese population.The study included 369 healthy individuals aged 36\u201387 years. Cardiovascular structure and function were assessed by the left ventricular ejection fraction, the early-diastolic peak flow velocity to late-diastolic peak flow velocity ratio at the mitral leaflet tips, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), the diameter of the bilateral common carotid artery (D), and blood systolic peak (SPV) and end diastolic velocities, which were measured by M-mode ultrasonography. Serum CTSB, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), 1, 25-dihydroxy vitamin D3, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.In men, serum CTSB was significantly related to IMT and IMT/D in the unadjusted model, and these associations were lost after age adjustment. In women, serum CTSB remained significantly associated with serum creatinine (SCr) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), estimated glomerular filtration rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.048) and IMT/D (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017) following full adjustment. PTH was independently associated with SCr. IGF-1 was significantly associated with SPV in women. CTSB was correlated with metabolic and endocrine biomarkers.Serum CTSB was associated with aging-related cardiovascular-renal parameters even in healthy people. Measurement of serum CTSB alone or in combination with metabolic and endocrine biomarkers can provide valuable information for predicting cardiovascular-renal function in healthy people, especially in elderly women.",

Majority of the available literature assessed under nutrition in the facility based settings. We aimed to determine the prevalence of under-nutrition and its associated factors among elderly, in a rural setting.A community based cross sectional survey was conducted among elderly in one of the randomly selected sub centre catchment area in rural Puducherry, south India. Information on socio demographic characteristics, morbidities and perception on their nutritional status were obtained. Anthropometric measures such as weight and arm span were measured by trained medical graduate as per the standard guidelines. Bodymass index (BMI) less than 18.5\u00a0kg/m2 was considered as under-nutrition.Of total 296 elderly in the study setting, 271 (92%) participated in the study. The prevalence of under nutrition among the elderly was 24.8% (95% CI: 19.7\u201330.3). More than half of the elderly (58.7%) perceived their nutritional status as poor; of them 28.9% were actually under-nourished. Mean (SD) BMI scores were higher for elderly women compared to that of men [elderly women vs men: 22 (4.6)\u00a0kg/m2 vs 21 (3.8)\u00a0kg/m2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03]. In multivariate analysis, being an elderly male, age more than 70 years and per capita income less than 1000 INR were found to be significantly associated with under-nutrition.In this rural area, one fourth of elderly were under nourished. Urgent inter-sectoral measures including food security programs are required to address this huge nutritional problem in this vulnerable group.",

Based upon our previously elaborated profiles of psychogeriatric patients, this study aimed to describe these courses and to explore whether changing clinical profiles could predict living arrangements at discharge.Retrospective data were collected on 397 patients with dementia and hospitalized from 2011 to 2014 in French-speaking Switzerland. Patients were classified on admission and at discharge using four clinical profiles (BPSD-affective, BPSD-functional, BPSD-somatic, and BPSD-psychotic). Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of living arrangements at discharge. Age, gender, marital status, living arrangements on admission, and clinical profile on admission and discharge, were used as potential predictors.Of the patients classified as BPSD-functional or BPSD-affective on admission, 70.18% and 73.48%, respectively, had the same classification at discharge. However, 45.74% of patients classified as BPSD-somatic on admission were discharged with a BPSD-functional profile, and 46.15% of inpatients classified as BPSD-psychotic on admission were discharged as BPSD-affective (\u03c72(9)\u00a0=\u00a0128.8299; p\u00a0<\u00a00.000). At discharge, 64.99% of all patients were admitted to a nursing home. The significant predictors of return to home were: being male (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.96; 95% CI: 0.93\u20130.99) and BPSD-affective profile (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.95; 95% CI: 1.08\u20133.54.

This randomized controlled trial adopted from the baseline sample, 113 volunteers (67.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2\u00a0years) were randomly assigned to a control group (CG, n\u00a0=\u00a064) or an experimental group (EG, n\u00a0=\u00a069). The EG took part in a 24-week RT program, conducted three times per week. Body composition measurements were repeated at the end of the training program. RT induced a significant increase in fat-free mass (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but not decrease in fat mass in the EG. Moreover, the SO index was also significantly improved in the EG (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), while it decreased significantly in the CG (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

It was aimed to determine the most appropriate time for measuring blood pressure in transition from supine to upright position in order to diagnose OH in elderly. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) including Head up Tilt Table (HUT) test was performed in 407 geriatric patients. Orthostatic changes were assessed separately for the 1st, 3rd and 5th minutes (HUT1, HUT3 and HUT5, respectively) taking the data in supine position as the basis. The mean age, recurrent falls, presence of dementia and Parkinson\u2019s disease, number of drugs, alpha-blocker and anti-dementia drug use, and fasting blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the patients with versus without OH; whereas, albumin and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels were significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, different from HUT3 and HUT5, Charlson Comorbidity Index and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus were higher, the use of antidiabetics, antipsychotics, benzodiazepine, opioid and levodopa were more common (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Statistical significance of the number of drugs and fasting blood glucose level was prominent in HUT1 as compared to HUT3 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Comparison of the patients that had OH only in HUT1, HUT3or HUT5 revealed no difference in terms of CGA parameters. These results suggests that orthostatic blood pressure changes determined at the 1st minute might be more important for geriatric practice. Moreover, 1st minute measurement might be more convenient in the elderly as it requires shorter time in practice.",

Cross-sectional data from the aging arm of the Rugao Longevity and Aging Study were used. Sleep duration, sleep quality, depression, LS and covariates were analyzed using logistic regressions. To assess the potential mediation of depression on the association between sleep duration and quality and LS, Aroian tests were used. Of 1756 older Chinese adults aged 70\u201384 years, 90.7% of the men and 83.3% of the women reported being satisfied with their lives. After adjusting for covariates, older adults who slept \u22646\u00a0h per night were more likely to suffer from life dissatisfaction compared with those who slept 7\u20138\u00a0h (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.67, 95% CI 1.86\u20133.79), and individuals who slept poorly were almost 2 times (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.91, 95% CI 2.16\u20133.91) more likely to have life dissatisfaction. The Aroian tests confirmed that these relationships were partially mediated by depression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Between short sleep and LS, the mediating effect of depression accounted for 13.9% of the total effects. Moreover, the mediating effect of depression on the association between sleep quality and LS was 13.3%. Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality were inversely associated with LS, and the relationships were partially mediated by depression. Our study suggests that both sleep and depression status are important factors for LS among the elderly.",

We compared difference by country in the outcome (perception of ACP timing), rated on a 1\u20135 agreement scale. Regression analyses examined whether a country difference can be explained by contrasts in demographics, presence, exposure and role perceptions.There was wide variability in agreement with the initiation of ACP at dementia diagnosis, in particular in the UK but also in the Netherlands (60.8% agreed, 25.3% disagreed and 14.0% neither agreed, nor disagreed). Large differences in physician characteristics (Dutch physicians being more present, exposed and adopting a stronger role perception) hardly explained the modest country difference. The perception that the physician should take the initiative was independently associated with agreeing with ACP at diagnosis.There is considerable ambiguity about initiating ACP in dementia at diagnosis among physicians practicing in two different European health care systems and caring for different patient populations. ACP strategies should accommodate not only variations in readiness to engage in ACP early among patient and families, but also among physicians.",

It was hypothesized that neuropsychiatric symptoms and the apolipoprotein E genotype increase the likelihood of Alzheimer\u2019s disease development.Utilizing data from the National Alzheimer\u2019s Coordinating Center, information from evaluations of 11,453 cognitively intact participants was analyzed. Survival analysis was used to explore relationships between individual neuropsychiatric symptoms as determined by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, apolipoprotein E, and eventual AD diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to explore the main effects and synergistic (additive and multiplicative) interactions.This study provided evidence for an increased hazard of developing AD among participants with any of the symptoms assessed by the NPI-Q. The hazard of developing AD was almost thirteen times higher for \u03b54 carriers with delusions and eleven times greater for those with apathy and disinhibition. Statistically significant hazards (p\u00a0>\u00a00.001) were also realized by \u03b54 carriers with hallucinations; agitation; depression; anxiety; elation; apathy; irritability; and motor, sleep, and appetite disturbances.Findings suggest that neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with eventual AD diagnosis among a group of cognitively asymptomatic participants at baseline. Many studies begin with a group of participants already impacted by AD diagnosis. The longitudinal analysis of a group of participants who, at baseline, demonstrated no observable signs of AD was a strength of this study. This investigation contributes to the literature exploring an increased hazard of AD due to potential modifiable risk factors and genetic biomarkers such as apolipoprotein E.",

The baseline geriatric assessment recorded activities of daily living (ADL), sociodemographic information, numbers of drugs prescribed, previous hospital admissions and falls, cognitive function, hearing and visual capacity, body mass index, blood pressure, and the Short Physical Performance Battery to evaluate lower limb function. ADL was re-assessed after 12 months, defining functional loss as a fall of \u226510 points on the Barthel Index and/or \u22652 instrumental activities of the Lawton Index. Bivariate and multivariate analyses using logistic regression models were conducted to identify factors independently associated with functional loss.Mean age was 81.7 years, 58.7% of patients were men, and 23.4% presented functional loss at the 12-month follow-up. Variables identified as independent predictors of functional loss were hospital admissions (aOR 3.92; 95%CI: 1.35\u201311.39), cognitive impairment (aOR 2.60; 95%CI: 1.39\u20134.92) and lower limbs functional limitation (aOR 2.01; 95%CI: 1.02\u20133.97).Our results support the use of performance batteries in primary care for identifying elderly persons at risk of functional decline; and they also highlight the relevance of appropriate management of hospital admissions and planned discharges in order to preserve patients\u2019 functional status.",

Utilization of antithrombotic drugs, comorbidities, functional, mental and nutritional status were evaluated through a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). A Logistic regression model was used to assess variables associated with antithrombotic use. On admission, 198 patients (49.6%) used oral anticoagulants (OAC), 125 (21.3%) antiplatelets, 32 (8%) low weight molecular heparin (LMWH) and 44 (11%) none of them.

To fill this knowledge gap, the goal of this study was to obtain a comprehensive phenotype of sarcopenic obesity in this high-risk population.Cross-sectional study of 680 subjects (mean age\u00a0=\u00a079\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09, 65% female) assessed between 2009 and 2013 at the Falls and Fractures Clinic, Nepean Hospital (Penrith, Australia). The assessment included a comprehensive examination, posturography, gait velocity, grip strength, bone densitometry and body composition by DXA, and blood tests for biochemical status. Patients were divided into four groups based on DXA and clinical criteria: 1) sarcopenic obese; 2) non-sarcopenic obese; 3) sarcopenic and; 4) non-sarcopenic/non-obese. The difference between groups was assessed by one-way ANOVA, chi-square analysis, and multivariable linear regression.Sarcopenic obese subjects were older (81.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3), mostly female and more likely to have lower bone mineral density, lower grip strength, slower gait velocity, and poor balance. Sarcopenic obese individuals also showed significantly higher parathyroid hormone and lower vitamin D.We identified a particular set of clinical and biochemical characteristics in our subgroup of sarcopenic obese older fallers. Identification of these particular characteristics in the clinical setting is essential in order to prevent poor outcomes in this high-risk population.",

We conducted a systematic review to discuss the effects of regular physical exercise on kinematics and kinetics of obstacle negotiation in the elderly.A comprehensive literature search revealed 859 citations for review, whereof 206 studies entered the full-text analysis. After application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, 13 studies were included in this systematic review.Most of them presented a reasonable quality (average 0.68) but none of them reached the level of a randomized control trial. Interventions were heterogeneous, with training periods lasting from 5\u00a0days to 10 months. Studies assessed obstacle negotiation basically considering 3 types of testing paradigm, namely a walkway with either a single obstacle crossing, or with multiple obstacles, or else a treadmill with an obstacle avoidance task under time pressure.In general, longer training programs had better results and very short ones were not effective. A weekly frequency of 2\u20133 times was the most common among the studies showing positive effects. Regardless of exercises types performed, most of them were effective and so far, there is no consensus about the best exercise for improving obstacle negotiation. A lack of studies on this topic still is evident. Including a record of fall score can further help in deciding which programs are to be preferred.",

Here, we aimed to investigate the associations of high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) with frailty and overnight hospital admission in an elderly Chinese population.We used cross-sectional data from 1478 participants (aged 70\u201384 years) who were randomly recruited from 31 villages in Jiang\u2019an township, Rugao city, China. Frailty status was defined using a modified frailty phenotype. The number of overnight hospital admissions was ascertained.The sample mean age was 75.3 years, and 53.0% of participants were female (n\u00a0=\u00a0784). The mean level of hsCRP was 3.6\u00a0mg/L.

For frailty, the age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.21 (95% CI: 0.89, 1.64) for participants in the intermediate hsCRP group and 1.49 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.09) for participants in the high hsCRP group compared with those in the low hsCRP group. For overnight hospital admission, the corresponding ORs were 1.26 (95% CI: 0.72, 2.19) and 1.94 (95% CI: 1.08, 3.48), respectively. After adjustment for other covariates, the significance of these associations remained.Elevated levels of hsCRP were associated with increased risks of frailty and overnight hospital admission among elderly individuals in Rugao.

A two-week control period was followed by four weeks of 100\u00a0g fresh star fruit juice consumption twice per day after meals.Plasma TNF-\u03b1, IL-23, IL-2, NO and the 6MWD were evaluated twice during the control period (weeks 0 and 2) and once after the star fruit juice consumption (week 6).The results showed that all parameters in the blood did not change significantly during the control period. After 4 weeks of star fruit juice consumption, a significant reduction in NO, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-23 was found; however, there was no change in IL-2. Moreover, the 6MWD increased significantly at week 6, when compared to that at week 0 and 2. Furthermore, the results also showed a significantly positive and negative correlation of NO and TNF-\u03b1 to the 6MWD, but no correlation of IL-23 and IL-2.This preliminary study concluded that consumption of star fruit juice at 100\u00a0g twice daily for one month can significantly depress the pro-inflammation cytokines: TNF-\u03b1, IL-23, and NO, while increasing walking distance. Low TNF-\u03b1 and high NO also present a significant correlation to walking capacity in elderly individuals.",

Multiple-indicator latent growth curve modeling was used to examine how 12 disablement factors predicted the rate of change in GFD.

Greater age (B\u00a0=\u00a0.025), female gender (B\u00a0=\u00a0.114), and greater numbers of comorbidities (B\u00a0=\u00a0.038) were associated with faster increase in GFD.

Our findings add to the understanding of how disablement factors contribute to the rate of change in GFD. Predisposing factors played the main role. However, the factors we found to be associated with the rate of change in GFD in older adults were slightly different from the factors reported in the literature. Decreasing the number of comorbidities and increasing the level of physically active leisure time activity should be considered priorities for preventing disability as people age.",

First hospitalisation in old age may act as a catalyst for ongoing intensification of health problems and acute care use. This study examined factors associated with first incident hospitalisation in women aged over 70, accounting for the health inequalities associated with geographic location. Survey data from 3780 women from the 1921 to 1926 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women\u2019s Health were matched with the Admitted Patients Data Collection and National Death Index. Days to first event (hospitalisation or death) were modelled using competing risks methods. A total of 3065 (80.3%) women had at least one hospital admission. More than half of the top 15 reasons for first hospitalisation were related to cardiovascular disease, with atrial fibrillation the most common. Proportional subdistribution hazards models showed that first hospital admission was driven by enabling and need factors including asthma/bronchitis diagnosis (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.16; p\u00a0=\u00a00.047), private health insurance (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.16; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) more than two prescribed medications in previous month (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.31; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), more than four general practitioner visits in previous year (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.50; p\u00a0=\u00a00.034), lower physical functioning (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.99; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and living in an inner regional area (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.17; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).

ANOVA was used to compare the means of elders\u2019 depressive symptoms between groups while paired-t test was used to compare changes in elders\u2019 depression symptoms from 2003 to 2007. Logistic regression was performed to determine the associations between elders' changing behaviour of caring for grandchildren and changes in depressive symptoms.Elders continuously caring for grandchildren or started to take care of grandchildren significantly felt happier and enjoyed life more than before and more than elders who do not provide grandchild care. Logistic regression analyses exploring the impact of grandchild care provision found that elders provided no grandchild care had worst mental health amongst all. Elders stopped providing grandchild care had significantly higher risk of developing depressive symptoms (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.40) than elders provided no grandchild care at all time.By self-comparison, this study illustrates how taking care of grandchildren maintains elders\u2019 mental health, especially against them from loneliness and depression.",

Serum lipid profile and glucose metabolism markers were measured for assessment of cardiovascular disease risk factors. Moreover, subjects' cognitive functions were tested.Most of the study participants reached the daily step goal of 10,000 steps and thus fulfilled the ACSM recommendations for the quantity and quality of cardiorespiratory exercise. Highly negative correlations between the number of steps per day and body adiposity markers, serum insulin and HOMA-IR confirmed that vigorous physical activity at the recommended level was associated with better body composition and lower levels of risk markers of coronary heart disease and diabetes. Most of the U3A students were characterized by a favorable lipid profile, prevalence of normal blood pressure, low rates of HOMA-estimated insulin resistance and normal cognitive function.Adherence to ACSM recommendations is associated with beneficial changes in risk factors related to cardiovascular disease.",

A gap exists as to what these advanced life events (ALEs) entail and the planning that older adults perceive is necessary. The purpose of this study was to identify seniors\u2019 perceptions and planning toward ALEs that may impact their ability to remain in their own home. We conducted focus groups with 68 seniors, age \u226565 years (mean age 73.8 years), living in the community (rural, urban, and suburban), using open-ended questions about perceptions of future heath events, needs, and planning. Three investigators coded transcriptions using constant comparative analysis to identify emerging themes, with disagreements resolved via consensus. Subjects identified five ALEs that impacted their ability to remain at home: (1) Hospitalizations, (2) Falls, (3) Dementia, (4) Spousal Loss, and (5) Home Upkeep Issues. While recognizing that ALEs frequently occur, many subjects reported a lack of planning for ALEs and perceived that these ALEs would not happen to them. Themes for the rationale behind the lack of planning emerged as: uncertainty in future, being too healthy/too sick, offspring influences, denial/procrastination, pride, feeling overwhelmed, and financial concerns. Subjects expressed reliance on offspring for navigating future ALEs, although many had not communicated their needs with their offspring. Overcoming the reasons for not planning for ALEs is crucial, as being prepared for future home needs provides seniors a voice in their care while engaging key supporters (e.g., offspring).",

The personalised citizen assistance for social participation (APIC) involves weekly three-hour personalised stimulation sessions targeting significant social and leisure activities difficult to accomplish. Recently adapted for older adults, the APIC\u2019s impact on this population is unknown.This study explored the impact of APIC on older adults with disabilities.A mixed-method design including a pre-experimental component was used with 16 participants (11 women) aged 66\u201391 (79.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7) with disabilities, living at home. They completed functional autonomy, social participation, leisure and quality of life questionnaires, and semi-structured interviews.APIC increased older adults\u2019 functional autonomy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), accomplishment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and satisfaction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) with social participation, and frequency of leisure practice (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Post-intervention, participants wished to modify the practice (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and frequency (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) of leisure activities, and difficulties in their social environment diminished (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).

Older adults thought APIC helped them resume, maintain, explore and experiment with significant social activities. It also increased their psychological and physical well-being, feeling of control, connectedness, self-esteem and motivation to accomplish activities. Finally, APIC can compensate for an unavailable and crumbling social network.APIC is a promising intervention that leads to new opportunities for older adults to increase community integration and enhance the social component of their lives. It can also optimise how the needs of older adults are met, including utilisation of personal and environmental resources.",

However, the type of treatment that citizens would choose in critical health situations and whether their decision varies with their sociodemographic characteristics and their experiences of life both within and outside the family context, are unknown. This study analyzes the factors associated with choosing or refusing life support treatment in hypothetical situations of differing clinical complexity. This transversal descriptive study was carried out by questionnaires given to 1051 participants from primary care centres. The Life Support Preferences Questionnaire (LSPQ) used to assess preferences of life-sustaining treatment, describes six scenarios with different prognoses. Analysis of the sociodemographic characteristics and life experiences of the subjects led to the following findings. In situations of very severe prognosis, treatment is mostly rejected. When there is chance of recovery, treatment is mostly accepted, especially in the least aggressive cases and when deciding for another person. A greater propensity to reject treatment was observed among subjects over 55 years, those in poor health and those who had observed a terminal illness in a family member. Practising Catholics are more likely to accept treatment in all medical situations described. Preferences for life support treatment are linked to sociodemographic characteristics and life experiences of patients. Physicians should bear in mind these characteristics when confronted with critical clinical situations, involving difficult decisions.",

Inclusion criteria: (1) DSM-IV criteria for manic episode (2) age above 60 years, (3) episode severity necessitating inpatient treatment, (4) Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) score at baseline >20, and (5) no prior asenapine treatment.

This cross-sectional study included 144 depressed inpatients from seven psychogeriatric hospital units in Norway and 106 community-living older adults without depression. HRQoL was measured using Euro Qol Group\u2019s EQ-5D Index and visual analog scale (EQ-VAS). Two aspects of coping were of primary interest for HRQoL: locus of control (LOC) and ways of coping (WOC). Measures of depressive symptoms, cognitive functioning, instrumental activities of daily living, and general physical health were included as covariates. In linear regression analyses adjusted for age, stronger external LOC was associated with poorer HRQoL in both depressed and non-depressed older adults. In the fully-specified regression models for both groups, the association between stronger external LOC and poorer HRQoL remained significant for the EQ-VAS score but not the EQ-5D Index. WOC was not associated with HRQoL in either group. Total amount of explained variance in fully-specified models was considerably lower in the sample of depressed, hospitalized older adults (17.1% and 15.5% for EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS, respectively), than in the sample of non-depressed, community-based older adults (45.8% and 48.9% for EQ-5D Index and EQ-VAS, respectively). One aspect of coping (LOC orientation) was associated with HRQoL in both depressed and non-depressed older adult samples, and therefore may be an important target for intervention for both groups. Differences in the amount of variance explained in models for the two groups warrant further research.",

Interestingly, 3.7% of participants with aMCI converted to non-aMCI, while 45.5% of participants with non-aMCI converted to aMCI. Moreover, a higher proportion of non-aMCI (27.3%) reverted to a cognitively normal state, compared to aMCI participants (18.6%), indicating that non-amnestic cognitive impairment is more unstable than amnestic cognitive impairment, and probably converges toward aMCI. Additionally, we found that weight loss was associated with incident MCI and future MCI. Weight loss was negatively correlated with Clinical Dementia Rating (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and significantly associated with a higher risk of MCI conversion from a cognitively normal state (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.10, 95% CI: 1.00\u20131.21, p\u00a0=\u00a00.042).This study supports that non-amnestic MCI is prone to converge toward amnestic MCI, and the elderly people with weight loss are at risk for developing cognitive decline.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of frailty and determine if the frailty index, a comprehensive geriatric assessment, was associated with the prognosis of older people in a Chinese population.Data were drawn from the Beijing Longitudinal Study of Aging, a representative cohort study with an 8-year follow-up. Evaluations based on the use of the frailty index were performed in a cohort of 1808 people aged 60 years and over residing in Beijing urban and rural areas. The initial survey was conducted in 2004, with follow-up surveys at 3, 5, and 8 years. Mortality data for all individuals were collected and analyzed.The frailty index and the age of individuals showed the same trend, with a higher frailty index expected as age increased. Respondents with the same frailty index level differed across factors such as sex and location. Male individuals, rural dwellers, and older individuals showed higher frailty rates than female individuals, urban dwellers, and younger individuals.Frailty is a condition associated with problems across multiple physiological systems. The frailty index increases with age, and may be a significant tool for evaluation of the prognosis of older people in China.",

Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify key themes.The theme of supporting personhood was identified as the overarching concept of importance to both people with dementia and their family members and as the foundation for quality care. There were subtle differences in how this concept was expressed by people with dementia themselves and their family members. However, for both groups, access to meaningful activities and opportunities to feel useful and valued were identified as important ways to support personhood in residential care. Separate to this theme of personhood, family members also talked about the importance of a supportive physical environment in the care home, while for the people with dementia themselves maintaining a connection with family was an important contributor to their experience of good quality residential care.Supporting personhood was identified as a critical key concept underpinning quality residential aged care, from the perspective of both people with cognitive impairment and their family members. This highlights the important contribution that the psychological and social characteristics of care make to providing a good quality residential care experience from the perspective of consumers with dementia.",

Clinical data including injury severity score (ISS), admission Glasgow coma scale (GCS), in-hospital complications, length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality were collected. Continuous data were analyzed using Mann\u2013Whitney tests and categorical data using Fisher exact tests. Variables in the univariate tests were analyzed in a multivariate logistic regression.Nursing home patients were older than community patients, presented with lower GCS, lower hemoglobin, higher international normalized ratio (INR) and a higher percentage of patients with body mass index (BMI)\u00a0<\u00a018.5. LOS for nursing home patients was longer, and they suffered higher rates of in-hospital complications. ISS, rates of traumatic brain injury, operative intervention and mortality were not significantly different.

The cognitive functions were evaluated by neuropsychological tests including mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and clinical dementia scale (CDR).Repeated-measures multivariate analyses showed that there was a significant group-by-time interactions for the temporal changes of the MMSE and CDR between the two groups. The group-by-time interactions remained significant when the atherosclerotic patients were sub-classified into either an extracranial stenosis (EC) group or an intracranial stenosis(IC) group. Comparing either the EC or IC group with the non-atherosclerosis group, there were no main effects by time or group alone, but there were significant group-by-time interactions for the MMSE and CDR.Cognitive function worsened more in terms of progressive impairment in AD patients with cerebrovascular atherosclerosis compared to AD patients without cerebrovascular atherosclerosis, regardless of whether the atherosclerosis was extracranial or intracranial.",

Atherosclerotic plaques in the Apo E\u2212/\u2212 mice were assessed using frozen sections of the aortic root. The protein levels of COX III and 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (OGG1) were determined.while mtDNA deletions accumulated significantly in mice as young as 2- month-old, atherosclerotic plaques were not detected until mice were 6 months old or older, suggesting that mtDNA deletion occurs prior to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the aortic root of these mice. Moreover, the expression levels of mtDNA-encoded COX III protein in both 2-month-old and 16-month-old C57BL/6J ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice were significantly lower than those in C57BL/6J mice (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

To this purpose, 50 semi-structured interviews were conducted with spouses and children of older people receiving their help to manage the consequences of involuntary urinary and/or faecal leakage. Findings show that incontinence has a remarkably strong effect on caregivers\u2fff quality of life, because it results in progressive social isolation, causing them financial problems as well as psychological and physical exhaustion. The lack of appropriate support and the general silence regarding the problem, which is still considered a taboo by many, aggravate the caregivers\u2fff situation. It is therefore crucial that caregivers can count on a strong public and private support network, appropriate information and suitable incontinent products, in order to better handle incontinence and care tasks in general.",

     "abstract": "Falling during walking is a common problem among the older population. Hence, the challenge facing clinicians is identifying who is at risk of falling during walking, for providing an effective intervention to reduce that risk. We aimed to assess whether the clinical version of the narrow path walking test (NPWT) could identify older adults who are reported falls.A total of 160 older adults were recruited and asked to recall fall events during the past year. Subjects were instructed to walk in the laboratory at a comfortable pace within a 6 meter long narrow path, 3 trials under single task (ST) and 3 trials dual task (DT) conditions without stepping outside the path (i.e., step errors). The average trial time, number of steps, trial velocity, number of step errors, and number of cognitive task errors were calculated for ST and DT. Fear of falling, performance oriented mobility assessment (POMA) and mini-metal state examination (MMSE) were measured as well.Sixty-one subjects reported that they had fallen during the past year and 99 did not. Fallers performed more steps, and were slower than non-fallers. There were no significant differences, however, in the number of steps errors, the cognitive task errors in ST and DT in POMA and MMSE.Our data demonstrates slower gait speed and more steps during the NPWT in ST and DT in fallers. There is no added value of DT over the ST for identification of faller\u2019s older adults.",

The objectives of this study are: to identify the scales described in literature that are applicable to polypathological patients and analyze their clinical outcomes.A systematic review was performed. Data sources were MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science which were consulted until August 2014. Inclusion criteria: (1) studies that specify the list of drugs, describe the methodology for their elaboration and how they calibrate the anticholinergic potential and (2) studies that use the scales identified as a tool to measure exposure to anticholinergic drugs in polypathological patients or those with similar characteristics. The main differences between the scales and main results on cognitive, functional and mortality status were collected.25 articles were included. 10 scales were identified. For their preparation, 8 were based on literature about drugs with anticholinergic activity and/or previously published scales as well as expert opinions. Exposure to anticholinergic drugs has been linked to cognitive disorders (basically measured with Anticholinergic Risk Scale (ARS), Anticholinergic Cognitive Burden Scale (ACB) and Drug Burden Index (DBI)) and functional scale (with ARS and DBI). However, there is no clear relationship with mortality. The Anticholinergic Drug Scale was the only one that obtained no association with any of the variables studied.There is a great variety of scales published and applied to older patients. The clinical results are different depending on the scale used which is probably due to the different methodology in their elaboration.",

The aims of this review were to identify malnutrition risk from nutrition screening studies that have used validated nutrition screening tools in community living older adults; and to identify types of nutrition interventions, pathways of care and patient outcomes following screening.A systematic literature search was performed for the period from January 1994 until December 2013 using SCOPUS, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, PubMed and COCHRANE databases as well as a manual search. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were determined for the literature searches and the methodology followed the PRISMA guidelines.Fifty-four articles were eligible to be included in the review and malnutrition risk varied from 0% to 83%. This large range was influenced by the different tools used and heterogeneity of study samples. Most of the studies were cross sectional and without a subsequent nutrition intervention component. Types of nutrition intervention that were identified included dietetics care, nutrition education, and referral to Meals on Wheels services and community services. These interventions helped to improve the\u2019 nutritional status of older adults.Timely nutrition screening of older adults living in the community, if followed up with appropriate intervention and monitoring improves the nutritional status of older adults. This indicates that nutrition intervention should be considered a priority following nutrition screening for malnourished and at risk older adults. Further evaluation of outcomes of nutrition screening and associated interventions, using structured pathways of care, is warranted.",

     "abstract": "A challenge for researchers is that vitamin D has many functions in the body, and vitamin D status across the world is not optimistic. There was little data regarding insufficient vitamin D status and its adverse effect on health of elderly Chinese people. So we selected 686 subjects (310 men and 376 women) aged 60\u201389 years to explore the correlation between vitamin D status and their life quality in a community-based osteoporosis prevention study at Qianfoshan Hospital of Shandong University from 2009 to 2010. All subjects were divided into three groups: vitamin D adequacy [serum 25(OH)D\u00a0\u2267\u00a075 nmol/L], hypovitaminosis D (50\u201374.9\u00a0nmol/L), and vitamin D insufficiency (<50\u00a0nmol/L). Participants were requested to complete SF-36 health survey. The regression models were used to evaluate respectively the association between 25(OH)D levels and parameters of SF-36. As a result, serum 25(OH)D levels were 58.60\u00a0nmol/L in male [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 56.7\u201360.5\u00a0nmol/L] and 54.17\u00a0nmol/L in female (95% CI: 52.8\u201355.8\u00a0nmol/L). Vitamin D adequacy was in 19.4% of male and 14.4% of female. With aging, proportions of insufficient vitamin D increased significantly in male (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and in female (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The elderly with hypovitaminosis D got lower scores than that with vitamin D adequacy (almost P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Regression analysis showed that vitamin D appeared a positive association with parameters of SF-36 (almost P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In conclusion, vitamin D status in the elderly was severely inadequate, which decreased their life quality and cause adverse effect on their health.",

     "abstract": "Sensory impairment affects an increasing number of elderly adults, with a negative psychological impact. Our objective was to examine the associations of visual and hearing impairment with subjective well-being (SWB), an important psychological concept defined by life satisfaction [LS], positive affect [PA], negative affect [NA], and affect balance [AB] among long-lived individuals (LLIs) over 95 years of age.Data on 442 LLIs from the Rugao longevity cohort, a population-based study in Rugao, China, were analyzed. Graded classifications of visual and hearing impairment (none, mild, moderate, and severe) were constructed from self-reported items. Bivariate correlation and multiple regression analysis were performed to test the associations.Approximately 66.1% and 87.3% of the subjects reported varying degrees of visual and hearing impairment. Following the degree of vision impairment, LS, PA, and AB decreased linearly, whereas NA increased linearly (all p for trend<0.05). Vision was significantly related to LS (r\u00a0=\u00a00.238, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), PA (r\u00a0=\u00a00.142, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), NA (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.157, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and AB (r\u00a0=\u00a00.206, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After adjustment for multiple variables including functional ability, an important factor of SWB, the associations of vision impairment with LS, NA, and AB, while diminished, still existed.Visual impairment, but not hearing impairment, was independently associated with low SWB among LLIs, and functional ability may play a mediating role in the observed relationship. The findings indicate that rehabilitation targeted for those with reduced vision and functioning in long-lived populations may be important for promoting well-being and quality of life.",

Of those, 208 (11.1%, 95% CI 9.7\u201312.5) had died. The age-standardised mortality rate was 10.2% (95% CI 8.8\u201311.6). Age-standardised mortality rates were lower than estimated for the UK (13.9%). In Cox regression analysis, greater age, higher levels of functional disability, use of a walking aid, subjective report of memory problems, being severely underweight and being normotensive were significant predictors of mortality.Those who survive to old age in Tanzania appear to have relatively low mortality rates. Physical and cognitive disabilities were strongly associated with mortality risk in this elderly community-dwelling population.

These challenges include among others lack of education, access to resources, caring for their sick children suffering from AIDS related diseases as well as their orphaned grandchildren.In-depth interviews were held with 15 retired women above 60 years old who are also heads of households, receiving or not receiving state pension, and/or a child support grant.The study reveals that friendship-based ties, social networks and their impact on the livelihoods, health, survival and social adjustment of the elderly women are essential components of their lives.The study also reports on the strategies they employ to alleviate poverty through their own and school-going age grandchildren's participation in income generating activities.The study indicates that for most women, the inability to attain basic essentials of life leads to loss of self-dignity. Socio-economic factors such as low levels of education, unemployment, little or no income, poor access to resources, many dependants and looking after their children who are ill creates a situation where they operate within the \u201clittle opportunities\u201d circle. The evidence in this study suggests that friendship-based ties, social groups, including social capital, pension grants, child support grants and remittances from their employed children help to mitigate some of the poverty experiences of the elderly women.",

Tone was significantly greater in older adults for BB but not for RF when data for males and females were combined (p\u00a0=\u00a00.28). There were no gender differences for BB in either age group. In RF, males had greater stiffness (young males 292 vs females 233\u00a0N/m; older males 328 vs females 311\u00a0N/m) and tone (young 16.4 vs 13.6\u00a0Hz; older 16.7 vs 14.9\u00a0Hz). Elasticity in RF was lower in young males than females but did not differ between the older groups (both males and females log decrement 1.6).Stiffness and tone increased with ageing and elasticity decreased. These findings have implications for detecting frailty using a novel biomarker.

The cancer patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: Group U or Group I. During the perioperative period, Group U received usual care, while Group I received MNI, which is based on usual care and aims to decrease the risk of PD. MNI focused on general geriatric approaches and supportive nursing care. On the day before surgery and the first three postoperative days, nocturnal (20:00\u20138:00) urine samples were collected. The melatonin sulfate and cortisol levels in the urine samples were determined. Moreover, the RASS (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale), CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit) and QoR40 (40-item quality of recovery score) scores were dynamically monitored.There were no significant differences in the general characteristics between the 2 groups. After surgery, the melatonin sulfate levels in the nocturnal urine of Group I were higher than those in Group U. The cortisol concentrations were lower in Group I compared to those in Group U. Group I achieved better postoperative RASS and QoR40 scores than Group U. Compared to Group U, Group I also experienced less PD (incidence and duration).MNI ameliorated some postoperative disturbances regarding sleep and stress, decreased the incidence of PD and improved recovery quality.",

This study was done to evaluate the usefulness of a new method to examine the function of activated platelets in order to assess DWMLs associated with cognitive decline.A total of 143 individuals (70.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1 years old) who underwent hospital-based health screening using head MRI were evaluated. DWLs were evaluated on T2-weighted and FLAIR images by semi-quantitatively grading them from Grade 0 (none) to Grade 3 (severe) using the Fazekas classification. Cognitive function was evaluated using the MMSE and the word fluency test. Platelet activation was assessed using fluorescence-labeled anti-human platelet monoclonal antibodies and semi-quantitatively determining PAC-1- and CD62P-positive rates by flow cytometry.Significant increases in hypertension and CD62P levels were observed with increasing DWML grade (2.6% in Group 0, 3.1% in Group 1, 4.1% in Group 2, and 5.0% in Group 3). CD62P levels were defined as elevated when they were above the mean\u00a0+\u00a02SD of the Grade 0 group, and the odds ratio of the Grade 2\u00a0+\u00a03 group was 3.03. A significant negative correlation was observed between CD62P levels and word fluency tests or the MMSE score.Elevations in CD62P levels, which reflect platelet function activation, were associated with white matter lesions accompanied by a decline in cognitive function. CD62P levels may be useful as a sensitive clinical marker for the early detection of DWMLs with cognitive decline.",

Our study was to estimate the prevalence and distribution of MCI in T2DM subjects from China, and identify influencing factors of subjects in MCI with T2DM.In the present study, we performed cluster random sampling of 8213 people aged 65 years and older in Tianjin, a metropolitan city, located in northern China. All participants were interviewed and screened for T2DM. 1109 subjects with T2DM were initially screened with American Diabetes Association criteria for diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and were diagnosed with MCI and dementia according to the criteria of DSM-IIIR. The prevalence of MCI and dementia in subjects with T2DM were compared with that in ordinary subjects. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate risk of MCI with T2DM.Among all 8213 subjects, overall MCI and dementia with T2DM prevalence were 13.5% and 2.34%, respectively. Compared with ordinary subjects, the prevalence of MCI in the present study was more frequent than the prevalence of MCI for the general population in almost each age group. In the univariate analyses, among all diabetic subjects, compared with cognitive intactly subjects, MCI subjects had significantly higher levels of age, current smoking, mean waist circumference, duration from onset of diabetes, insulin intake, systolic BP, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and immunoreactive insulin (IRI). In multivariate logistic regression analyses, variables including current smoking, duration from onset of diabetes, FPG, HbA1c and IRI were significantly associated with increased risk for MCI with T2DM, the ORs were 1.36,1.33,1.17,1.25 and 1.33, respectively (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The present study confirms the high prevalence of MCI with T2DM among the elderly population of China.

Previous studies on ToM in normal aging have provided heterogeneous findings. In the present study we examined whether a mixed calculation of different aspects of ToM may have contributed to these conflicting results. We had two aims. First, we explored the age-related changes in the performance of cognitive vs. affective ToM. Second, we investigated the extent to which the effect of aging on cognitive vs. affective ToM is mediated by age-related differences in executive functions.To address these issues three age groups (young, young-old, and old-old adults) were compared on cognitive and affective ToM using the faux pas test. In addition, participants were tested using a battery of executive function tasks tapping on inhibition, working memory updating, and word fluency.The analyses indicated that young adults outperform both young-old and old-old adults on cognitive ToM but not on affective ToM. Correlations showed that, whereas cognitive ToM was significantly associated with age, working memory updating, and inhibition, affective ToM was not. Finally, analyses revealed that individual differences in working memory updating (but not inhibition) mediated the effect of age on cognitive ToM.Our findings support the view of selective age-related differences on cognitive, but not affective, ToM in normal aging. The distinction between the two ToM components is further supported by a dissociable pattern of correlations with executive functions.",

A multidisciplinary approach is considered central to tailoring and targeting approaches to gerontological care, although this is often not realised in reality. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is seen as gold standard, though they are not readily available in many acute settings, compounded by the requirement for time, coordination of multidisciplinary specialties, and reimbursement issues. This systematic review aimed to identify multidisciplinary team interventions to optimise health outcomes for older people in acute care settings.Systematic review of randomised controlled trials reporting acute care multidisciplinary team based interventions, to improve care outcomes for hospitalised older people. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL (EBSCO), Cochrane and PsycINFO) were searched from 1 January 2000 to 1 July 2014 in the English language. Data was extracted by two reviewers and checked by a third reviewer to resolve any conflicts.Seven articles reporting RCTs met the systematic review inclusion criteria. The heterogeneity of study populations, multidisciplinary team interventions and outcome measures necessitated the use of narrative analysis. Three common elements of these studies included: (i) tailored treatment by clinicians with geriatric expertise (ii) a focus on transitional care interventions that enhance discharge planning; and (iii) communication an essential ingredient to improving care.The tailoring of treatment, underpinned with clear communication strategies can reduce emergency department re-admission rates, mortality and functional decline of older people. Refining health professionals roles and responsibilities within transition models is an essential component that can improve health outcomes for older people in acute care settings.",

Multiple stratification was performed based on participants\u2019 characteristics, then generalized linear models (GLM) were used to adjust confounding factor and analyze the effect of the intergenerational disagreements on depressive symptoms among participants with different characteristics.The intergenerational disagreements on preferred living arrangements for the elderly greatly impact on offspring caregivers\u2019 depressive symptoms. Especially in the following two situations: (1) in the case of older adults were relatively independent and offspring caregivers had to co-reside with older adults against their own will, the max mean difference on the depression measures was up to 10.603 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), in comparison with both parties were willing to co-reside. (2) In the case of older adults were fully dependent and offspring caregivers had not to hire a maid to care older adults against their own will, the max mean difference on the depression measures was up to 8.937 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), in comparison with both parties were willing not to hire a maid.Intergenerational disagreements on preferred living arrangement for the elderly have negative effect on offspring caregivers\u2019 depressive symptoms.",

This study examined medical diseases with other factors which lead to depression among the elderly.This Taiwan-based longitudinal study examined a collection of 1467 seniors aged over 65. Subjects who fit this criteria were initially interviewed in 2003, and then four years later. Independent variables included baseline demographics, chronic medical illnesses, and the change of subjects\u2019 self-perceived health status, functional limitations including ADL, IADL and mobility limitation factors. The dependent variable was the symptoms of incident depression, as ascertained by the ten-item questionnaire during the later session.

A total of 219 Korean retirees who had retired within the last three years completed the survey. The survey included the Activity Scale, Social Interest Scale, The Meaning in Life Questionnaire, and Center for Epidemiology Depression Scale.

A total of 221 persons completed the questionnaire on life-course determinants, frailty (using the Tilburg Frailty Indicator), self-reported chronic diseases, and adverse outcomes disability, quality of life, health care utilization, and falls. Adverse outcomes were analyzed with sequential (logistic) regression analyses.The integral model is partially validated. Life-course determinants and disease(s) affected only physical frailty. All three frailty domains (physical, psychological, social) together affected disability, quality of life, visits to a general practitioner, and falls. Contrary to the model, disease(s) had no effect on adverse outcomes after controlling for frailty. Life-course determinants affected adverse outcomes, with unhealthy lifestyle having consistent negative effects, and women had more disability, scored lower on physical health, and received more personal and informal care after controlling for all other predictors.The integral model of frailty is less useful for predicting adverse outcomes of residents of assisted living facilities than for community-dwelling older persons, because these residents are much frailer and already have access to healthcare facilities.The present study showed that a multidimensional assessment of frailty, distinguishing three domains of frailty (physical, psychological, social), is beneficial with respect to predicting adverse outcomes in residents of assisted living facilities.",

Exclusions: Inability to walk independently; diabetes mellitus; stroke (within 6 months), severe macular degeneration, glaucoma, retinal dystrophy; advanced cataract. Digital Retinal images of both eyes were analysed using the VAMPIRE software suite. Central Retinal Artery and Vein Equivalents (CRVE and CRAE) were measured. Body composition was measured using Dual Energy X ray Absorptimetry (DXA). Appendicular Skeletal Muscle Mass/Height2 was calculated. Physical function was measured: 6-min walk distance, Short Physical performance battery, handgrip strength and quadriceps strength.79 participants with mean age 72 (SD 6) years were recruited. 44% were female. Digital Retinal images of sufficient quality for measuring CRAE and CRVE were available for 51/75 (68%) of participants.

The prevalence of frailty, as diagnosed by screening methods, was: 50\u201379.9% (Balducci/Rockwood-G8). Multivariate analyses have identified all screening tests apart from Rockwood and TRST as independent factors that predict postoperative outcome. The sensitivity and negative predictive value in case of postoperative mortality were 60\u201391% (Rockwood\u2013VES-13) and 30\u201393% (GFI\u2013VES13).

Training was offered once a week for 2.3 years. Adherence was defined as the proportion of attended sessions relative to offered sessions. Participants were classified based on their adherence level into low (\u226433.3%), moderate (33.4\u201366.5%) and high (\u226566.6%) adherers.The mean length of training was 19\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 months, and 68% continued participation for at least two years.

High adherence was predicted by female sex; younger age; better cognition; independence in Instrumental Activities of Daily Living; higher knee extension strength; faster walking speed; and better performance on the Berg Balance Scale and Timed Up and Go tests. Poorer self-perceived health and the use of a walking aid were related to low adherence.Long-term continuation of training is possible for older community-dwelling adults, although poorer health and functional limitations affect training adherence.

MPI scores were obtained on admission and at discharge. In-hospital and one-year mortality was recorded. Adjusted Cox's regression models were used to assess the prognostic value of the MPI scores.691 were included in the study: 459 (66.4%) women and 232 (33.6%) men, mean age\u00a0=\u00a085.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.0 years. Patients were grouped as: low risk MPI 12.5%; moderate risk MPI 28.6%; severe risk MPI 58.9%.The cumulative in-hospital mortality rate was 7.4%. In the adjusted model, only MPI score (not MPI risk group) was significantly associated with in-hospital death ([HR]\u00a0=\u00a01.22, 95%CI 1.07\u20131.39).1-Year crude mortality rate: 39.2%.

Less is known about nutrient intakes across heterogeneous older populations.We examined nutritional status and nutrient intakes in different samples of older people representing broad spectrum of healthy and frail populations. We evaluated adequacy of their energy, protein and micronutrient intakes in comparison to recommendations.Cross-sectional study combined five datasets: home-dwelling older people participating in nutrition education and cooking classes (NC) [n\u00a0=\u00a054], participants from Helsinki Businessmen Study [n\u00a0=\u00a068], home-dwelling people with Alzheimer disease (AD) [n\u00a0=\u00a099] and their spousal caregivers (n\u00a0=\u00a097), participants from Porvoo Sarcopenia and Nutrition Trial (n\u00a0=\u00a0208), and residents of Helsinki assisted living facilities (ALF) [n\u00a0=\u00a0374]. Nutritional status was assessed using Mini Nutritional Assessment and nutrient intakes retrieved from 1 to 3 day food records.Those suffering most from mobility limitation and cognitive decline had the poorest nutritional status (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities). However, low intakes of energy, protein, and micronutrients were observed in high proportion in all groups, inadequate intakes of vitamins D, E, folate, and thiamine being most common. Protein intakes did not differ between the groups, but 77% of all participants had lower than recommended protein intake. In general, the NC group had highest micronutrient intakes and the ALF group the lowest. However, AD females had the lowest energy, protein, and vitamin C intakes.Our study provides a detailed picture of risks related to nutrient intakes in various groups of older people. These findings could be used in planning tailored nutrition interventions.",

     "abstract": "Knowledge on disability's impact among older women and men in Ecuador is limited. This paper provides gender-specific estimates of disability prevalence, life expectancy with and without disability, and the factors associated with gender differences in disability at older age in Ecuador (2009\u20132010).Data from the Health, Well-Being, and Aging Survey (SABE) Ecuador 2009 was used. Participants were 4480 men and women aged 60 and over. Life expectancy with and without disability was calculated using the Sullivan method. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore gender differences in disability prevalence. Two disability measures, indicating limitations in activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), were used.60-year-old women in Ecuador can expect to live 16.3 years without ADL limitations compared to 16.9 years for men. Life expectancy without IADL limitations was 12.5 years for women and 15.5 years for men. At age 60, women's length of life with ADL and IADL disability was higher (7.9 years for women vs. 4.9 years for men with ADL, and 11.7 years for women vs. 6.3 years for men with IADL). After controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, chronic conditions and lifestyle factors, gender differences in ADL disability were not statistically significant. However, older women were 58% more likely (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.58, 95% CI 1.27, 1.95) to report having IADL limitations than men, even after including control variables.Interventions should tackle chronic disease, physical inactivity, and socioeconomic differences to reduce women's vulnerability to disability in older age.",

Prevalence of IAS was assessed in patients with strokes as well as in stroke-free individuals. A logistic regression model was constructed with stroke as the outcome, IAS as the exposure, and confounders (demographics and cardiovascular risk factors) as independent variables.Out of 267 participants (mean age 71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 years, 57% women), 15 (5.6%) had intracranial arterial stenosis, including 10 out of 52 (19.2%) persons with stroke and five out of 215 (2.3%) without.

Mechanisms underlying stroke in patients with IAS included perforator occlusion, artery-to-artery embolism and hypoperfusion.Prevalence of IAS in Ecuadorian Natives/Mestizos is similar to that in Asians.

Treatment and control rates for coronary artery disease (CAD) in Chinese patients are poorer than rates in western countries. However, no previous prospective study has focused on perioperative MACE in this population. Our aim was to ascertain the incidence and risk factors associated with MACEs in Chinese patients.Consecutive CAD patients, aged \u226560 years, who underwent non-cardiac surgery at five medical centers in China, were prospectively enrolled. Clinical variables, including electrocardiogram and troponin I levels, were evaluated to estimate MACEs. The main outcome was occurrence of at least one perioperative MACE from admittance to 30 days after surgery, defined as any of the following complications: cardiac death, nonfatal cardiac arrest, acute myocardial infarction (MI), congestive heart failure (CHF), and angina. MACE independent risk factors were based on the Andersen\u2013Gill multiplicative intensity model.Of the 1422 patients recruited, 129 (9.1%) developed at least one MACE, and cardiac death occurred in 11 patients (0.8%). The independent risk factors contributing to postoperative MACE included age \u226575 years, female gender, history of MI, history of hypertension, high-risk surgery, intraoperative hypotension, and intraoperative hypoxemia.The incidence of MACE in Chinese elderly patients with CAD who underwent non-cardiac surgery was 9.1%. Seven independent risk factors for a perioperative MACE were identified. Preventing intraoperative hypoxemia and hypotension may reduce the occurrence of MACE in these high risk patients.",

The pooled RR of PD was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56\u20130.62) for ever smokers compared with never smokers. The stratified analyses indicated a somewhat greater impact of smoking on PD risk in cohort studies than in case-control studies, the protective effect was relatively significant in men more than in women and the inverse effect was slightly greater in hospital-based studies than in population-based studies. Furthermore, a significant inverse dose\u2013response relationship was observed for the number of pack-years smoked.

Nonmotor symptoms (Nonmotor Symptoms Scale), PD status (Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale or Montgomery\u2013Asberg Depression Scale) and health-related quality of life (39-item Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire) were assessed. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to establish a nonmotor symptom factor, which was analyzed to evaluate whether the results were associated with the clinical severity measures.Exploratory factor analysis revealed one factor comprised of sleep/fatigue, attention/memory and mood/cognition. The modified Hoehn and Yahr Stage, Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale Part III, Montgomery\u2013Asberg Depression Scale and the 39-item Parkinson\u2019s Disease Questionnaire Summary Index were independently associated with the sleep/fatigue, attention/memory and mood/cognition domains. The presence of these domains was associated with advanced Parkinson\u2019s disease or depressed mood.This study shows that motor impairment and depressed mood in PD are related to sleep/fatigue, attention/memory and mood/cognition. Sleep/fatigue, attention/memory and mood/cognition also had a major impact on health-related quality of life. It is appropriate to identify patients with severe motor symptoms and depressed mood in order to signify the need to consider more detailed care and further assessment.",

Perceived aspects of home influence life satisfaction, perceived health, independence in daily activities and well-being among very old people.

Therefore, the main aim was to explore whether perceived aspects of home are related to number of and specific domains of symptoms in a cohort of people aged 67\u201370. Interview and observation data on aspects of home and health, collected with 371 individuals living in ordinary housing in urban as well as rural areas in southern Sweden, were used. Descriptive statistics, correlations, multiple linear and logistic regression models were employed. The results showed that the median number of symptoms was 6.0. Reporting fewer reported symptoms was associated with a higher meaning of home (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and lower external housing related control beliefs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) but not with usability in the home.

Low meaning of home was significantly associated with heart-lung symptoms (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), and low usability was associated with depressive symptoms (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). In conclusion, showing that perceived aspects of home are important for health in terms of physical and mental symptoms, this study contributes to the knowledge on the complex interplay of health and home in the third age.",

The Correlation between POMA and ECRF scores and the factor analysis of ECRF were considered as the concurrent and construct validity respectively. The Factor affecting the fall occurrence was assessed using the Cox-regression model.The mean age of the participants was 76.02 (SD 8.82). Fifty two individuals (27.3%) fell at least once during the mean 756 (SD 187)-day follow up. The Spearman correlation coefficient between ECRF and POMA scores was -0.458 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Three components were detected in the factor analysis of the ECRF. In the univariate Cox-regression model, the hazard ratio was 1.04 (CI: 1.00\u20131.07) for each score increase of the ECRF. For the six-month follow-up, at the ECRF cut-off point two of eight, the sensitivity and specificity were calculated as 85.7% and 64.5% respectively.It seems that the ECRF is a valid tool for predicting the next 6 months\u2019 fall incidents in older adults.",

     "abstract": "To present the study design and baseline results of the longitudinal International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS) on gender differences in physical performance and mobility disability prevalence in five diverse societies.Data are from surveys on random samples of people aged 65\u201374 years at Canadian (Kingston, Ontario; Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec), Mediterranean (Tirana, Albania) and Latin American sites (Natal, Brazil; Manizales, Colombia) (N\u00a0=\u00a01995). Mobility disability was defined as reporting difficulty in walking 400\u00a0m or climbing stairs. Activities of daily living (ADL) disability was based on any self-reported difficulty in five mobility-related ADLs. The short physical performance battery (SPPB) was used to assess physical performance. Poisson regression models were fitted to estimate prevalence ratios.Age-adjusted prevalence of low SPPB, mobility disability and ADL disability were higher in women than in men in all sites except for Kingston. After adjustment for education and income, gender differences in SPPB and ADL disability attenuated or disappeared in Saint-Hyacinthe and Manizales but remained large in Tirana and Natal and mobility disability remained more frequent in women than in men at all sites except Kingston. After further adjustment by chronic conditions and depressive symptoms, gender differences in mobility remained large at all sites except Kingston but only in Tirana did women have significantly poorer physical performance than men.Results provide evidence for gender as a risk factor to explain poorer physical function in women and suggest that moving toward gender equality could attenuate the gender gap in physical function in old age.",

The Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) was used to determine the concurrent validity of the Balance CAT. ANOVA and post hoc analysis were employed to investigate the discriminative ability of the Balance CAT. The paired t test was used to validate the efficiency.A total of 120 participants completed assessments of the Balance CAT, the BBS, and the Barthel Index (BI). The Pearson's r between the scores of the Balance CAT and the BBS was 0.90. Groups with different levels of dependence had significantly different mean scores of the Balance CAT. The mean IRT reliability of the Balance CAT scores was 0.93. The mean administration time of the Balance CAT was about 28% of that of the BBS, and the mean number of items used in the Balance CAT was 3.4.The Balance CAT had excellent concurrent and discriminative validity, reliability, and efficiency in residents of LTC facilities. These results indicate that the Balance CAT is a sound and practical measure for assessing the balance function of residents of LTC facilities.",

Both groups received a 60-min intervention three times a week for eight weeks. The Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was administered. To identify the possible placebo effect, 30-Second Chair Stand Test (30SCST), 8-Foot Up-and-Go Test (8FUGT), and 2-Minute Step Test (2MST) were also administered.intention-to-treat analysis with adjustment for baseline levels revealed that IFVRG showed greater improvement in mental health (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) and lower body strength (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042), compared to GG.

The distribution of skeletal muscle index (SMI; SMM/height2) groups was described and muscle force\u2013velocity characteristics were examined between SMI-groups over the adult life span. Subjects were divided into age categories and SMI groups to compare their muscle strength characteristics. Isometric and isokinetic strength, ballistic movement speed and muscular endurance of the knee extensors were evaluated on a Biodex dynamometer.Age by gender interaction effects were found significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) for all strength tests. In general, the overall drop in slow and faster knee extension strength was larger than the isometric component, with women showing larger losses by the age of 60\u201370 years compared to men. Regression analysis revealed significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) age-related reductions, with the largest explained variance for the muscular endurance parameter (24%). No age by SMI-group interaction effect was observed for muscle function, but main effects of age and SMI were significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).The age-related decline in muscle function was stronger in women. Furthermore, a low SMI results in a weaker muscle function compared to a normal SMI in each age-category, pointing out that its relationship with physical disability should therefore be further examined over the adult life-span.",

The objective of this study was to assess the application of the EWGSOP algorithm in hospitalised elderly patients with impaired functional capacity.One hundred in-patients (aged 84.1 SD 8.5, 62% women) were prospectively studied in a postacute care geriatric unit focused on rehabilitation. Sarcopenia was assessed by corporal composition (electrical bioimpedance), handgrip strength, and physical performance (gait speed). Other measurements were Charlson index, length of stay, and functional gain at discharge and 3-month follow-up. All patients were screened by the EWGSOP algorithm and sarcopenia was confirmed according to diagnostic criteria.Gait speed was <0.8\u00a0m/s in all cases and 58 patients had low muscle mass, which, according to the EWGSOP-algorithm, would indicate a diagnosis of sarcopenia. No differences were observed in functional capacity between these patients and those with normal muscle mass. When decreased handgrip strength was considered, 47 of these patients met the EWGSOP criteria for severe sarcopenia. In this group, differences in functional capacity were observed at discharge (Barthel 45.2 vs. 56.3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.042) and 3-month follow-up (48.3 vs. 59.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.047).The application of the EWGSOP algorithm in hospitalised, postacute, elderly patients with low gait speed suggested that muscle strength should be considered before confirming or discarding a sarcopenia diagnosis.",

The independent variables were age, gender, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, diagnosis of memory disorder, mobility level and living arrangements, fracture type, delay to surgery and urinary catheter removal during acute hospitalization.Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed the prefracture mobility level of walking outdoors (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.47, 95% CI 0.30\u20130.75) or indoors (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.25, 95% CI 0.09\u20130.72) assisted to be associated with a smaller decrease in mobility level.

A total of 290 patients participated in this study, of which 128 were admitted to the rehabilitation department. OH was defined as a drop in systolic blood pressure of >20\u00a0mmHg and diastolic blood pressure of >10\u00a0mmHg after postural change within 3\u00a0min. The analyses regarding falling and successful rehabilitation were only performed in the rehabilitation group. Multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to describe risk factors related with falling. Cox proportional hazard modeling was used to investigate the relation between OH and the time to successful rehabilitation.The prevalence of OH in the studied nursing home population was 36.6% (95% CI (confidence interval): 31.1\u201342.1%). The prevalence varied from 28.6% (95% CI: 16.8\u201340.4%) in somatic patients, 36.7% (95% CI: 28.4\u201345.1%) in rehabilitation patients, to 40.6% (95% CI: 31.3\u201350.0%) in psychogeriatric patients. The association between orthostatic hypotension and previous falling was not significant; Odds ratio 0.66 (95% CI: 0.30\u20131.48). The Hazard ratio of the relationship between OH and successful rehabilitation was 2.88 (95% CI:1.77\u20134.69).OH is highly prevalent in nursing home residents. Surprisingly, patients with OH were found to have a higher chance of successful rehabilitation compared to patients without OH.

We investigated the association of sagittal spinal alignment with muscle thickness as an index of the mass of lumbar back muscles and muscle echo intensity as an index of the amount of non-contractile tissue within these muscles.Study participants comprised 36 middle-aged and elderly women. Thickness and echo intensity of erector spinae, psoas major, and lumbar multifidus muscles were measured using an ultrasound imaging device. Standing sagittal spinal alignment, determined from thoracic kyphosis and lumbar lordosis angles, and the sacral anterior inclination angle was measured using the Spinal Mouse.Stepwise regression analysis performed using muscle thickness, echo intensity, and age as independent variables showed that erector spinae muscle thickness was a significant determinant of the thoracic kyphosis angle. Psoas major muscle thickness and echo intensity of the lumbar multifidus muscle were significant determinants of the sacral anterior inclination angle.Our results suggest that an increase in thoracic kyphosis is associated with a decrease in the mass of the erector spinae muscle, and that a decrease in pelvic anterior inclination is associated with a decrease in the mass of the psoas major muscle and an increase in the amount of non-contractile tissue within the lumbar multifidus muscle.",

All participants were interviewed with designed questionnaire, multidimensional scale of perceived social support (MSPSS) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) to elicit socio-demographic profile, social support and depressive psychopathology respectively.The participants were largely females (52.9%) and their mean age was 68.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.3 years. A little above one-quarter (26.4%) had depressive episode, and mild severity was preponderant. Low level of social support was associated with depression (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a08.418, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004); especially low social supports from significant others (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a03.989, p\u00a0=\u00a00.046) and family members (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a04.434, p\u00a0=\u00a00.035). Similarly, severity of depression in the elderly correlated negatively with availability of social support from significant others (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a05.495, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) and family members (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a05.149, p\u00a0=\u00a00.023).Considering the burden of depression in this elderly population and the influential roles of social support especially from family and significant others on depression; strengthening of informal social support and formal social support for the elders is advocated. In addition, design of community based geriatric mental health with social services and articulation of public policy to address old age needs are implied.",

At a 5-year follow-up, 55 people (29.5%) were alive and able to complete the assessments again.ST was positively associated with psychological wellbeing, self-rated health, having someone to talk with and being able to go outdoors independently. Diagnoses of depression, dementia disease, and osteoporosis were associated with lower STS scores as were living in a residential care facility, and feeling lonely. There was a significant relationship between the index of negative life events and ST between baseline and follow-up. More negative life events were associated with a larger decline in STS scores over five years.ST is an important source for wellbeing among the oldest old, and the accumulation of negative life events might threaten the ability to transcend setbacks.",

Our analyses indicated that the effect of cohort was not a statistically significant explanatory factor of loneliness. Living status, self-rated health and memory compared to age peers were statistically significant explanatory factors for suffering from loneliness. When we controlled the effect of depressiveness on the experience of loneliness, it was shown that the effects of living status and self-rated health remained statistically significant, whereas memory compared to age peers did not. Depressiveness itself was highly important. The combined effect of living status and self-rated health emerged as the most significant explanatory factor for loneliness. Older people with poor self-rated health who lived alone were most likely to suffer from loneliness.The findings give healthcare professionals an opportunity to plan for interventions aimed at combating loneliness among home-dwelling older people.",

One hundred and thirty-three (36%) caregivers reported high strain. In a three-group comparison including non-caregivers and caregivers stratified for strain, high strain was associated with lower SF12-PCS, SF12-MCS and LSI-A (0.014, <0.001 and <0.001, respectively).High strain affects caregivers\u2019 HRQoL and LS in a negative way.It is important for the health care sector to consider the possibility that symptoms in a person acting as a caregiver can be related to high perceived strain.A general policy program aiming to identify caregivers and their needs for support is much needed.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate predictive factors for frailty among older outpatient adults with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and to assess the predictive value of frailty in regard to mortality, disability and hospitalization at 1-year follow-up. A prospective cohort study was carried out with subjects over 65 years of age from an outpatient Cardiology clinic, with at least one CVD. At baseline, we classified frailty as proposed by Fried, i.e.; unintentional weight loss (10\u00a0lbs in the past year), self-reported exhaustion, weakness (measured by grip strength), slow walking speed, and low physical activity. A frail person was defined by the presence of three or more criteria, prefrail by one or two and robust by the absence of them. Disability, previous hospitalizations, falls, morphometric and socio-demographic variables were collected; as well as the presence of CVD and hemodynamic parameters (HP): systolic (SPB) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR) and ejection fraction (EF). At 1-year follow-up, the outcomes assessed were: disability, number of hospitalizations and death. 172 subjects were included in this study with a mean age of 77 years old. The prevalence of frail was 39.8%, prefrail 51.5% and robust was 8.7%. Among the CVD and HP evaluated, myocardial infarction (MI), presence of three or more CVDs, lower SPB and DBP were significant and independent factors associated with the frailty phenotype. At 1-year follow up, frailty was an independent predictor for disability (Odds Ratio (OR): 3.94 (1.59\u20139.75); p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and it increased death probability by three times if compared to the robust group. In conclusion, older outpatients with CVD have a higher probability to be frail than older adults who do not have a CVD. Low SPB and DBP must always be taken into consideration due to their high association with frailty. It is also important to diagnose frailty in this population due to the high association with mortality and disability.",

Handwriting was recorded using a writing tablet and measures of velocity, pauses, and pressure were extracted.Subjects with 2+ criteria were older, had more health problems and need for assistance but had higher education. No handwriting parameter differed between frailty groups (age and education adjusted). Writing velocity was not significantly slower among participants from the slowest 20th percentile of gait velocity but writing pressure was significantly lower among those from the lowest 20th percentile of grip strength. Poor endurance/exhaustion was not associated with handwriting measures. Low cognitive performance was related to longer pauses.Handwriting parameters might be associated with specific aspects of the frailty phenotype, but not reliably with global definitions of frailty at its earliest stages among subjects able to perform handwriting tests.",

Older males with a 12 minutes\u2019 walk t score of \u22122 or less and old males and females with a walking speed of 1\u00a0m/s or less had a lower RF thickness.There is a good concordance between RF ultrasound and DEXA.Assessment of RF using ultrasound appears to be a reliable and accurate method to evaluate muscle mass in older people.",

Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, anthropometry, resistance, reactance, and other independent predictive variables were assessed. The total sample was randomized and split into two sub-samples: one group for the development of the predictive single-frequency BIA equation and the other for its validation. The equation was derived by step-wise regression, the goodness of fit was assessed by the highest determination coefficient (R2) and precision by the lowest root mean square error. In the validation sample, the accuracy of the new and the published BIA equations was tested by pure error. In addition, Bland and Altman analysis tested the bias.The selected model had a R2 of 0.91 and a RMSE of 1.01\u00a0kg and fulfilled every regression assumption. The predictive variables included were: Ht2/R, sex, and body weight. The new BIA equation showed a PE close to RMSE of the estimate with no significant bias. The published BIA equations proved to be inaccurate and had significant bias.This new single-frequency BIA-derived equation was precise, accurate and free of bias. Published BIA equations to estimate ASM should not be used indistinctly in other ethnic groups without validation.",

Four groups of data (anthropometric measurements, biochemical markers, three-day diet record and geriatric assessment scales) were recorded. Long and short forms of MNA test were performed. Two different geriatricians interpreted the patients\u2019 nutritional status with the aid of aforementioned data. Patients were divided into three groups which were patients with malnutrition, with malnutrition risk and well-nourished. Concordance between the two geriatricians\u2019 clinical assessment was analyzed by kappa statistics. Excellent concordance was found, therefore the first specialist's decisions were accepted as gold-standard. A third physician performed the long and short forms of MNA test. The concordance between the first clinician's assessment and MNA test results were compared subsequently.MNA and MNA-SF results were compared with first clinician's decision of malnutrition and kappa coefficients were 0.68 and 0.66, respectively. Sensitivity analysis indicated that MNA was 92% sensitive and 86% specific, whereas MNA-SF was 94% sensitive and 81% specific.MNA and MNA-SF are suitable for malnutrition screening in Turkish older adults.",

Our objective was to develop a standard-set based on the ICF for describing functioning and disability in older individuals with joint contractures in geriatric care settings, giving special emphasis to activities and participation.The ICF-based standard set was developed in a formal decision-making and consensus process and based on an adapted version of the protocol to develop ICF Core Sets. These are sets of categories from the ICF, serving as standards for the assessment, communication and reporting of functioning and health for clinical studies, clinical encounters and multi-professional comprehensive assessment and management.Twenty-three experts from Germany and Switzerland selected 105 categories of the ICF component Activities and Participation for the ICF-based standard set. The largest number of categories was selected from the chapter Mobility (50 categories, 47.6%).The standard set for older individuals with joint contractures provides health professionals with a standard for describing patients\u2019 activity limitations and participation restrictions. The standard set also provides a common basis for the development of patient-centered measures and intervention programs. The preliminary version of the ICF-based standard set will be tested in subsequent studies with regard to its psychometric properties.",

All subjects were confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, and underwent physical examination, laboratory tests and carotid ultrasonography check. Finally, 392 patients were included according to the exclusion criteria. The odds ratios of independent variables were calculated using stepwise multiple logistic regression.Carotid intimal-medial thickness (IMT) and RDW are both significantly different between CAS group and control group. Univariate analyses show that high-sensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) and RDW (r\u00a0=\u00a00.436) are both in significantly positive association with IMT. Stepwise multiple logistic regression shows that RDW is an independent protective factor of CAS in patients with ischemic stroke.

Convergent validity and known-group comparison were examined for construct validity. Exploratory factor analysis and second-order confirmatory factor analysis were utilized to examine the factor structure. Reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha values for internal consistency.This study demonstrated a substantial convergent validity of the PCQ-P in English as higher scores correlated significantly with higher resident life satisfaction (r\u00a0=\u00a00.459), and the satisfactory construct validity as evidenced by a significantly higher mean PCQ-P score from residents in higher quality nursing homes.

The PCQ-P showed satisfactory internal consistency reliability (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.89).The English version of the PCQ-P is a valid and reliable tool to directly measure the perceptions of the person-centered climate in the U.S nursing homes.

Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards model were performed to examine the association between base-year body weight status and future onset of cognitive impairment.Compared with their normal weight counterparts, the unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for cognitive impairment incidence was 2.03 (95% confidence interval: 1.38\u20133.00), 1.15 (1.02\u20131.29), 1.28 (1.14\u20131.43), and 1.59 (1.33\u20131.92) among underweight (BMI\u00a0<\u00a018.5), overweight (25\u00a0\u2264\u00a0BMI\u00a0<\u00a030), class I obese (30\u00a0\u2264\u00a0BMI\u00a0<\u00a035), and class II obese or above (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a035) participants, respectively. The unadjusted relationship between obesity and cognitive impairment onset appeared stronger among females than among males. After adjusting for base-year individual sociodemographics, functional limitations and chronic conditions, the estimated associations between body weight status and cognitive impairment were attenuated but remained statistically significant for underweight participants.Underweight is a robust risk factor for onset of cognitive impairment in later life. Weight management programs targeting middle-aged and older adults should focus on achieving and maintaining optimal body weight.",

The participants conducted obstacle gait training for 8 weeks and foot contact time and foot pressure right before and after crossing the obstacle were measured for 3 times: before the intervention, at the 4 weeks, and 8 weeks using F-scan (Tekscan, USA).The results show that foot contact time did not decrease right before crossing the obstacle but decreased right after crossing the obstacle (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Foot pressure moved from the end of the frontal foot to the midfoot (MF) and heel (HL) right before crossing the obstacle (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Foot pressure increased in lesser toe (LT) right after crossing the obstacle (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).These results indicate proper weight distribution in feet, increased foot stability due to increased muscle power and flexibility, and improved strategy to cope with the obstacle. The obstacle gait training may be helpful to the elderly who would either fear for or limit outdoor activities due to the risk of falls based on the result of this study.",

Participants underwent a health assessment (HA) at baseline, 18, 36 and 60 months and a GP record review (GPRR) at baseline, 36 and 60 months. Disability was measured via difficulty in 17 Activities of Daily Living. Trajectory identification was assessed by gender stratified, mortality adjusted, group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM) and the impact of life-course SES (level of education; occupational class; deprivation) on trajectory membership evaluated (adjusting for confounding variables).851 participants agreed to HA and GPRR, 840 (98.7%) with complete disability data. Four distinct trajectories were evident for both sexes. A disability-free trajectory between age 85 and 90 was identified in men only (9% of the sample). The most disabled trajectories had severe disability at age 85 progressing to profound disability by age 90. After adjusting for confounders education remained significant; men and women with most education being less likely to be in the most disabled trajectory (Men: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.80, 95% CI 0.65\u20130.98; women: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.59, 95% CI 0.42\u20130.83).Distinct disability trajectories are evident in the very old and these are influenced by education, suggesting SES disadvantages cumulate throughout the life-course to create health and mortality inequalities later.",

Before and after intervention, body composition, functional ability, aerobic fitness and metabolic health parameters including lipid profile, inflammatory markers, glucose metabolism, hormones and growth markers were examined.Circulating concentrations of epidermal growth factor increased significantly in the MCT group from 35.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.4 to 56.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035\u00a0pg/ml.

The prevalence of self-reported constipation increased from 14% in 1992\u20131993 to 21% in 2003\u20132004. There was a corresponding increase in the prevalence of laxative use from 6% to 15% over the same period. At both time points, females reported a higher prevalence of both constipation and laxative use however the female:male prevalence ratios decreased over time indicating higher increases in the prevalence of each among males. Persistent chronic constipation occurred in 9% of the cohort. The association between laxative use and self-reported constipation was poor and laxative use was associated with self-reported constipation in less than a third of cases.The prevalence of both constipation and laxative use increases with age in the elderly, and these increases are greater for males than for females. Discrepancies between self-reported constipation and laxative use may suggest sub-optimal management of constipation in the community-dwelling elderly and further work is needed to fully understand this.",

Individuals over the age of 60 were included in the study, while those hospitalized or in terminal phase were excluded. Data collection included sociodemographic information, FI characterization, as well as variables related to the institution itself and to health conditions (comorbidities, medication, pelvic floor surgery, Barthel Index for functional capacity and Pfeiffer test for cognitive status). FI was verified through the Minimum Data Set (MDS) 3.0, which was also used to assess toileting programs. The Chi-square test and the linear Chi-square test were performed for bivariate analysis, as well as logistic regression for multivariate analysis. The final sample consisted of 321 elderly, mostly females, with mean age of 81.5 years. The prevalence of FI was 42.68% (CI 95%, 37.39\u201348.15). Most residents presenting FI were always incontinent (83.9%) and the most frequent incontinence type was total FI (solid and liquid stools). Incontinence control measures were applied only to 9.7% of the residents. The final model revealed a statistically significant association between FI and functional and cognitive impairments. It is concluded that FI is a health issue that affects almost half of the institutionalized elderly, and is associated with functional and cognitive disability.",

In contrast, elevated WBC and IL-6 as assessed 21 days after the surgery were associated with a significantly worse outcome.The survival of elderly patients undergoing the surgery for acute hip fracture is unfavorable. In contrast to previous reports, we did not confirm that acute inflammatory response to the surgery predicts the long-term survival. On the contrary, persistent elevation of WBC and IL-6 three weeks after the surgery indicates a poor outcome.",

Life satisfaction was evaluated according to the Life Satisfaction Index, and the geriatric syndromes included a depressive disorder, cognitive impairment, functional impairment, urine incontinence, pain, a fall, and polypharmacy. Other characteristics were age, sex, marital status, education level, self-rated health, and chronic diseases.Univariate analysis revealed that the older adults, who were illiterate, did not live with a partner, yet other issues such as stroke, malignancy, osteoarthritis, poor self-rated health, a depressive disorder, functional impairment, urine incontinence, or pain were associated with lower life satisfaction. In the multivariate regression model, the older adults who were male, illiterate, lived without a partner, had poor self-rated health, or had a depressive disorder were more likely to have lower life satisfaction. In addition, life satisfaction was unaffected in the older adults with only 1 geriatric syndrome, but among those with \u22652 geriatric syndromes, an increased number of geriatric syndromes were associated with lower life satisfaction.In addition to socio-demographic factors, cumulative effects of multiple geriatric syndromes might affect life satisfaction in the older adults.

Between April 2009 and May 2013, 287 patients (365 knees) aged >65 years who had undergone primary TKA were enrolled. These patients were assigned to the delirium group of 11 patients (11 knees) or the non-delirium group of 276 patients (354 knees). The incidence of delirium among the patients was 3.1% (11/365). Univariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a history of dementia, older age, lower body mass index (BMI) level, and a postoperative day 3 blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of >14.9\u00a0mg/dL were risk factors. However, multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that a history of dementia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 10.4, [1.09, 100]), older age (AOR: 1.15, [1.01, 1.31]), and a postoperative day 3 BUN level of >14.9\u00a0mg/dL (AOR: 4.76, [1.15, 19.7]) were independent risk factors.

The frailty phenotype was modified from a previously adapted version and a 46-item frailty index was created following a standard protocol. Both measures demonstrated a right-skewed distribution, higher levels of frailty in women, exponential increase with age and associations with high healthcare utilization and poor self-reported health. More people classified as frail by the modified phenotype had ADL disability (97.8%) compared with the frailty index (56.6%) and similarly for IADL disability (95% vs. 85.6%). The prevalence of frailty was 3.6% using the modified frailty phenotype and 34% using the frailty index. Frailty index scores in those who were classified as robust by the modified phenotype were still significantly associated with poor self-reported health and high healthcare utilization. The frailty index and the modified frailty phenotype each confirmed previously established characteristics of frailty scales. The agreement between frailty and disability was high with each measure, suggesting that frailty is not simply a pre-disability stage. Overall, the frailty index classified more people as frail, and suggested that it may have the ability to discriminate better at the lower to middle end of the frailty continuum.",

Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each potential risk factor adjusted for the others.Incidence of traffic accidents was estimated as 11.74/1,000 per year for men, and 7.65/1,000 per year for women. It tended to decline as age increased among women; compared to the youngest old age group (60\u201364), the older old groups (70\u201374 and 80+) were at lower risk for traffic accidents.

Village residents reported cycling and gardening more frequently (49.2% and 75.8%) than residents of the largest cities (20.6% and 45.8%, respectively).There are several differences in the LTPA of older adults in Poland compared with those in North America or Western Europe. Community-based and environmental policies should concentrate on a combination of sustaining existing favorable physical activity (PA) habits (gardening and cycling), and developing access and motivation for participation in LTPA characteristic of developed countries.",

Violence experienced in the last 6 months was measured using the Hurt, Insulted, Threatened with harm, or Screamed at (HITS) scale and classified according to type (physical or psychological) and perpetrator (partner or family member). Binary logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between experiences of violence and gender, socioeconomic conditions, and social relations.Physical violence (by partner or family member) was reported by 0.63\u20130.85% of participants; the prevalence of psychological violence (by partner or family member) ranged from 3.2% to 23.5% in men and 9% to 26% in women. After adjustment for socioeconomic status, social relations, age and site, women experienced more psychological violence perpetrated by family members than did men (odds ratio (OR): 1.8; 95% CI: 1.2\u20132.6). Social relations, such as multifamily living arrangements and low levels of support from partners, children, and family, were associated with psychological DV. Current working status was associated with greater odds of victimization by partners among men (OR: 2.35 95% CI: 1.34\u20131.41), but not among women.Gender and social relations are important determinants of experiencing violence in older adults. The findings of this study demonstrate the importance of a gender-based approach to the study of DV in older adults.",

Some studies have explored the association between religious affiliation and cognitive decline. Only a small portion of patients with cognitive decline progress to dementia. However, the association between religious affiliation and dementia risk remains unclear.In this case\u2013control study, we recruited 280 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 138 with vascular dementia (VaD) (both aged \u226560 years) from three teaching hospitals in northern Taiwan between 2007 and 2010. Age-matched healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a0466) were recruited from an elderly health checkup program and from volunteers visiting the hospital during the same period. Three religious affiliations\u2014Taoism, Buddhism, and Christianity\u2014were evaluated. The study also assessed the effect of important factors such as gender or leisure activities on the association of religious affiliation with dementia risk.Participants with Christianity affiliation showed decreased AD risk (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]\u00a0=\u00a00.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a00.25\u20130.87) compared with those without any religious affiliation.

This study was based on a cross-sectional analysis of 5692 community dwelling adults aged 50 years and older included in wave 1 of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging. Frailty was assessed using both the phenotypic (FP) and frailty index (FI) models. OH was defined as a drop of \u226520\u00a0mmHg in systolic blood pressure or a drop of \u226510\u00a0mmHg diastolic pressure on standing from a seated position. OI was defined as reporting feeling dizzy, light headed or unsteady during this test. 346 (6.1%) participants had OH and 381 (6.7%) participants had OI. The prevalence OH in frail participants was 8.9%, compared to 5% in robust. Similarly the prevalence of OI was 14.3% in frail and 5.7% in robust participants. After adjustment for age and gender, OH was not significantly related to the FP (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.10 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.67, 1.81).

In fully adjusted models OI remained related to slowness and low muscle strength and to higher FI scores. These data suggest OI symptoms in older adults may reflect various important underlying health deficits, indicative of increasing levels of frailty. Further assessment of frailty in patients experiencing OI is a potential opportunity for early intervention to delay functional decline.",

Little is known about the meaning of lived experiences of urinary incontinence of these women's viewpoints in their context.The aim of this study was to illuminate the experience of Muslim community-dwelling postmenopausal women who were living with urinary incontinence (UI).Seventeen women with UI (range: 52\u201368 years) who had experienced it for more than ten years were interviewed. A phenomenological hermeneutic method was used to analyze and interpret the interview texts.The women's experiences of living with urinary incontinence have been presented in terms of three main themes: disruption of normal functioning, self-imposed restriction, and feelings of despair. Disruption of normal functioning meant emotional, spiritual, physical, and daily life disruption. Self-imposed restriction meant suppression of delights and needs and avoidance of social interactions. Feelings of despair referred to predictions of a bad and dark future of living with urinary incontinence, ambiguity, and hopelessness. The meaning of living with UI has been considered a \u2018stain in life\u2019. Health care providers should be familiar with the different manifestations of urinary incontinence for early diagnosis and prevention of the negative effects of this condition to improve quality of life. In addition, symbolic interactionism theory can help health care providers to understand the meaning of urinary incontinence for women.",

It is unknown if people living with dementia use the same strategies as other older adults and if a table positioned in front alters their performance. Twenty participants 65 years or older (10 with Alzheimer's disease or mixed dementia; 10 without dementia) performed six STS trials from a standard chair with armrests, including three trials without and three with a table in front. Trials were digitally recorded and the starting position and type and order of strategies used were rated by a blinded assessor. Starting position was similar between the groups. The most common strategy was leaning forward (119 out of 120 trials) while the least used was sliding forward (four out of 120 trials). People living with dementia used significantly more strategies (p\u00a0=\u00a00.037), pushed through the armrests more than older adults (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038) and moved feet backwards more frequently in trials without the table in front (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010). Presence of the table had no significant effect on STS performance of older adults (p\u00a0>\u00a00.317). Our results demonstrated that people living with dementia had a similar starting position but used more strategies to stand up, pushing through their arms more than older adults without dementia and moved their feet backwards more often when no table was in front.

The elderly patients with PC who had no progression after receiving endocrine therapy and had data of total prostate volume (TPV) before receiving endocrine therapy were asked to complete the questionnaire of International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaire with quality-of-life (QOL) assessment. Transrectal ultrasound assessment was performed in all patients to measure prospectively the TPV, maximum flow rate (Qmax) and residual urine volume (RUV) after endocrine therapy. A total of 42 patients aged 76\u201398 (87.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6) years finished the investigation, with duration of endocrine therapy ranged 1\u201317 (6.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2) years, including orchidectomy in 18 patients, medical castration with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analog in 24 patients. The TPV [28\u201353 (34.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7)\u00a0ml] after endocrine therapy was significantly decreased compared to that before endocrine therapy [28\u201353 (34.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7)\u00a0ml]. The Qmax was 8.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8\u00a0ml/s, RUV measured by B-Ultrasound was 37.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.9\u00a0ml. However, all patients presented LUTS with various severities, and had an IPSS score of 23.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 that was consisted by a score of 15.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8 for storage symptoms, 8.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2 for voiding symptoms, and had QOL score of 4.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8.

EMG analysis of the balance recovery step showed that both groups increased peak EMG of knee flexor and extensor muscles after intervention. After intervention, WBV increased peak EMG of the plantar flexors, which are used to exert the push-off forces just before the leg swing. Balance exercise in older women resulted in significant improvements in the balance recovery step after a simulated forward fall. WBV also had the additional benefit of improved step velocity, which was reflected in increased activity of the plantar flexors in the stepping leg.",

The second purpose was to identify functionally relevant cut-off values for muscle strength.770 community-dwelling older adults, 104 older adults living in assisted living facilities and 73 nursing home residents were included. Static strength, expressed in kg/kg body weight (BW), was measured using two field tests: handgrip (GRIP/BW) and knee extension (KNEE/BW) test. Functional performance was assessed with 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD, N\u00a0=\u00a0947) and modified Physical Performance Test (mPPT, N\u00a0=\u00a0152).Both GRIP/BW and KNEE/BW were positively correlated with functional performance in all settings (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

In assisted living facilities, KNEE/BW (R26MWD\u00a0=\u00a00.39 and R2mPPT\u00a0=\u00a00.35) was clearly a better predictor of functional performance than GRIP/BW (R26MWD\u00a0=\u00a00.15 and R2mPPT\u00a0=\u00a00.12). GRIP/BW had no added value to KNEE/BW in order to explain the variance in functional performance. Functionally relevant cut-off values for static strength, for men and women respectively, were set at 0.40 and 0.31 for KNEE/BW and at 0.43 and 0.31 for GRIP/BW.Handgrip and knee extension strength are both important predictors of functional performance in older adults. In assisted living facilities only, knee extension strength was clearly more predictive than handgrip strength.

Demographic and health data were collected during admission; the physical function, balance ability and home-living environment were examined by a structured questionnaire when admitted. The outcome of indoor fall injury was investigated by a visit in month 3, month 6 and month 12 after baseline survey. Univariate analysis and Multiple Logistic Regression Model were used to examine the associations between potential risk factors and outcomes of indoor fall injuries. Two hundred and thirty-one of the 3043 women (7.6%) eventually suffered indoor fall injuries at least once during the 1-year follow-up. The injurious falls of women were significantly associated with age, educational level, marital status, health status, balance ability, physical activity and home-living environment in the univariate analyses. Women who worried about falls and restrained activities for it were more likely to suffer fall injury. Younger women, with less chronic disease, with good balance ability and living in good corridor environment, were less likely to receive fall injury in multiple logistic regression analyses. Multidimensional factors were associated with indoor fall injuries for community-dwelling older women. Proper clinical treatment of chronic disease and improvement of women's balance ability, as well as reducing the risk factor of indoor environment, which will play vital roles in preventing indoor fall injuries, should be prioritized for the intervention strategy.",

Disability trajectories for activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs) were identified by using latent class growth curves modeling. Factors including demographics, health conditions, health behaviors, social relations, and use of assistive devices were significantly predicted different disability trajectories of older adults over the following 11 years by applying hierarchical logistic regression.Three disability trajectories \u2013 maintained function, progressive disability, and consistent disability \u2013 were identified. Predisposing factors such as younger age, more educational attainment, and better health conditions had protective effects of leading to a later healthier maintained function trajectory. Intra-individual factors such as engaging in leisure time activities (LTAs) were positively related to the maintained function trajectory but negatively related to the consistent disability trajectory; decreasing social networks was common to those on consistent disability trajectory; dissatisfaction with social support was noted in maintained function trajectory group. An extra-individual factor, using assistive devices, was significantly related to maintaining older adults\u2019 disability levels, even for those who started disabled.The findings suggested that predisposing, intra-individual, and extra-individual factors play different roles in the development of later disability trajectories. More educational attainment, better health conditions, active in LTAs, and using assistive devices might benefit the maintenance of functioning in Taiwanese older adults.",

A geriatrics rotation during internal medicine residency was the only independent factor associated with positive attitudes toward the elderly in this multivariate analysis. A geriatrics course during medical school was associated with positive attitudes in the univariate analysis, but only tended to be so in the multivariate analysis.Geriatrics rotation during internal medicine residency was independently associated with positive attitudes toward older people.

The Geriatric Depression Scale-15, a self-rating questionnaire assessing ADL, subjective QOL, social situations, and past and current medical status, was used. Depression of the elderly was associated with dependence in basic ADL, subjective QOL, and subjective sense of low economic status. After adjusting for the effects of age, sex, and basic ADL, subjective sense of low economic status was closely associated with depression in community-living elderly people in all three communities in Asia.

     "abstract": "Low dietary intake of calcium and poor vitamin D status during aging can result in mild secondary hyperparathyroidism, which may be associated with low muscle mass and reduced strength in the elderly. The aim of this study was to investigate whether low vitamin D, high parathormone (PTH), or both, are associated with sarcopenia. A total of 105 women, 35 with sarcopenia and 70 without sarcopenia, were enrolled in the present study. Body composition measurements were performed by DXA and sarcopenia was defined as skeletal muscle mass index\u00a0<\u00a05.45\u00a0kg/m2 and grip strength lower than 20\u00a0kg. Three-day dietary records were taken and adjustments for energy intake made. The estimated average requirement (EAR) method was adopted as a cut-off point for estimating the prevalence of inadequate intake. Serum total calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, intact PTH, and 25(OH)D were measured. Only 1% of the patients met the daily adequate intake for vitamin D and 11% met the daily adequate intake for calcium. Notably, the prevalence of sarcopenia was higher in hyperparathyroidism (25(OH)D\u00a0<\u00a020\u00a0ng/mL and PTH\u00a0>\u00a065\u00a0pg/dL) than in the absence of hyperparathyroidism (41.2 vs 16.2%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.046). The odds ratio for sarcopenia in hyperparathyroidism cases was 6.81 (95%CI 1.29\u201335.9) compared with participants who had low PTH and a high 25(OH)D concentration. The present study showed that vitamin D insufficiency associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism increased the risk of sarcopenia, suggesting that the suppression of hyperparathyroidism by ensuring adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be considered in interventional studies to confirm potential benefits.",

However, overweight, central adiposity, and hyperuricemia were associated with increased risk of CKD, with crude odds ratios of 2.41 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.23\u20134.69), 2.61 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.42\u20134.77), and 5.69 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.75\u201311.76), respectively. In addition, higher magnesium and filtration marker \u03b22 microglobulin (\u03b22M) were associated with CKD, with crude odds ratios of 2.47 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.38\u20134.43) and 16.38 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a06.76\u201339.64), respectively.We observe a high prevalence and unique related factors of CKD among the LLI in Rugao, which suggest that early screening and risk intervention of CKD are imperative to maintain a high quality of life and postpone the occurrence of poor outcomes.",

Serum levels of intact PTH, Nt-proBNP and biochemical parameters were examined. The enrolled patients were divided into groups by the levels of PTH and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classes.A total of 66 (36%) patients had PTH values above the upper limit of the normal range. Serum creatinine (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), Nt-proBNP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), serum calcium (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030), heart rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) showed statistical significance in different stages of PTH. The mean PTH and Nt-proBNP levels increased as the NYHA functional class increased. The optimal cut-off value of PTH to predict CHF-related death was 48.98\u00a0pg/ml, with 57.14% sensitivity and 86.24% specificity. The best cut-off point of Nt-proBNP was 480\u00a0ng/ml with 76.47% sensitivity and 80.48% specificity. Over a mean follow-up of 3 years, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves demonstrate that patients with higher levels of intact PTH had lower survival time, with a hazard ratio of 2.5 (95% CI 1.5\u20133.9).The study has shown that serum intact PTH level obtained in the elderly patients with CHF is a novel biomarker associated with Nt-proBNP and could provide supplementary information for the diagnosis and prognostic prediction of CHF, especially when it is used in combination with Nt-proBNP.",

A final selection of seven articles was used for the present manuscript. Although the selected studies showed positive effects on the risk of falling related to factors (balance, gait and dynamic mobility, strength and physical performance), there were some aspects of the studies such as the methodological quality, the small sample size, the lack of homogeneity in relation to the variables and the measurement tools, and the existing diversity regarding the study design and the type of dance, that do not enable us to confirm that dance has significant benefits on these factors based on the scientific evidence.",

The DL-questionnaire consists of 15 questions covering emotional well-being, social relationship, life-satisfaction, comfort, functional competence and autonomy. The scale ranges from 0 (=best OQoL) to score 30 (=worst OQoL). A trained occupational therapist did face-to-face interviews for measuring intra-rater reliability with 20 days interval, and 365 days after hip fracture surgery measuring responsiveness after recovery. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated by two raters in a subgroup.130 residents were eligible and completed the test\u2013retest (86%). The systematic difference was 0.49 points (95% confidence interval: \u22120.25; 1.23). Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) was 3.02 points, and the Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) was 8.37 points.

It is not easy for older drivers or their relatives to detect early signs of dangerous driving behaviors. We examine the types of driving behavior that increase in frequency with age. We surveyed people aged 40 and over among the general public in Japan using a self-administered questionnaire on sociodemographic factors, driving status, frequency of driving, 12-items on physical symptoms possibly related to driving performance, and 28-items on driving behaviors. Multiple logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) of occurrence of each of the 28 driving behaviors for a 5-year increase in age. Significant associations with a 5-year increase in age after adjusting for confounding factors were found for the following directly unsafe driving behaviors: (1) little or no sign of attempts to avoid dangerous situations (OR for a 5-year increase in age\u00a0=\u00a01.38, 95% CI: 1.18\u20131.63); (2) lack of attention to other people and cars (1.33, 1.12\u20131.60); (3) improper maneuvering around curves (1.33, 1.09\u20131.65); and (4) improper or no turn signals (1.33, 1.06\u20131.69).

A cohort of Japanese community-dwelling older adults (n\u00a0=\u00a0535) aged 60\u201391 years (73.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 year, 157 men and 378 women) who underwent community-based health check-ups from 2008 to 2012 were followed until 2013. Incidence rate of falls between walkers and non-walkers was compared separately by the number of risk factors (Groups R0, R1, R2, R3 and R4+). The Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the association between habitual walking and falls separately by lower- (R\u00a0<\u00a02) and higher- (R\u00a0\u2265\u00a02) risk groups. In Groups R0 and R1, the incidence of falls was lower in walkers than non-walkers; however, in Groups R2, R3, and R4+, the incidence of falls was higher in walkers. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that habitual walking was not significantly associated with falls (hazard ratio (HR): 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.48\u20131.62) among the lower risk group but that it was significantly associated with increased falls (HR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.04\u20133.43) among the higher risk group. The significant interaction between habitual walking and higher risk of falling was found (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

However, it is not certain whether factors commonly associated with falls and/or obesity mediate this risk. This research examines whether specific diseases, sedentary behavior, mood, pain, and medication use mediate the association between obesity and falls. A representative sample of community-living individuals aged 65+ years in New South Wales (NSW), Australia were surveyed regarding their experience of falls, height, weight, lifestyle and general health within a 12 month period. Intervening variable effects were examined using Freedman and Schatzkin's difference in coefficients tests and regression analyses were used to estimate relative risks.

Their ages were over 65 years. Fatty degeneration of muscles, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, obturator externus, adductor longus, rectus femoris and iliopsoas muscles, were evaluated by Goutallier's staging. Odds ratio was calculated by a logistic regression analysis allocating dependent variable for falls and independent variables for Goutallier's stage, age and gender. The fatty degeneration of gluteus maximus muscle was generalized, while that of gluteus minimus muscle was unevenly distributed, especially in anterior area. Gluteus minimus muscle initiated its fatty degeneration earlier than gluteus medius muscle. Odds ratio of falling was 3.2 (95% confidence intervals: 1, 14, 8.94) for Goutallier\u2019 stage of the gluteus medius muscle. Fatty degeneration of gluteus medius muscle has a crucial role in providing stability of the pelvis including hip joint. Evaluating fatty streaks in the gluteus minimus muscle could help give early indication to those who have a higher risk of falling.",

The intervention group also had a significantly lower mean number of visits to physicians in outpatient care 6\u201312 months after baseline (4.09 vs. 5.29, p\u00a0=\u00a00.047).The effect on ED visits not leading to hospitalization meant that those in the control group were more likely to visit the ED for reasons that did not require hospitalization, suggesting that they may have been less monitored than the intervention group. The intervention has the potential to reduce the burden on outpatient care and ED.",

The 100 older adults with diabetes who gave informed consent were randomly allocated 1:1 into management and control groups. The integrated health management model was applied in the former while the latter was only given usual care. This model included the following components: health record establishment, health evaluation and health management (such as: diet advice, psychological aspects of health, education/skills training on health self-management, regular blood glucose monitoring, long-term diabetes drug monitoring, etc.). After 18 months, differences in three categories of variables (subjective grading items, objective measurement health indices and health service utilization) between the two groups before and after the intervention were assessed with t-test, \u03c72-test and mixed model analysis. The management group demonstrated improvement on the following variables: health knowledge score, self-evaluated psychological conditions, overall self-evaluated health conditions, diet score, physical activity duration per week, regular blood sugar monitoring, waist-to-hip ratio, diastolic blood pressure and fasting blood sugar, the days of hospital admissions in the preceding 6 months. Mixed model analysis showed that gender, age, self-evaluated health status, self-evaluated psychological status, education level and resident status were important factors affecting health indices. This study demonstrated that integrated health management model was effectiveness in improving the health of older adults with diabetes.",

Multivariate logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios (OR) and to correct for confounders.We included 197 patients (141 cases). Mean age was 77 years (SD), 65% female. After adjustment for potential confounders, decreased LV systolic function was associated with hip-fractures (OR 3.2 [95%CI 1.1\u20139.1]). Increasing severity of LV dysfunction was also associated with hip-fractures (p for trend\u00a0=\u00a00.012).In conclusion, patients with traumatic hip-fracture had greater risk of decreased LV function than patients who underwent planned hip-surgery.

We studied a total of 919 consecutive post-acute ischemic stroke elderly patients admitted for rehabilitation. 22% out of the patients had recurrent stroke on index day. Functional outcomes of first-ever stroke patients and recurrent ischemic stroke patients were assessed by the Functional Independence Measurement scale (FIM\u2122) at admission and discharge. Data was analyzed by t-test, Chi-square test and by multiple linear regression analysis. There were 716 patients with first ever stroke and 203 patients with recurrent stroke. Total and motor FIM scores at admission and total, motor, gain and Montebello Rehabilitation Factor (RFG) FIM scores at discharge were similar in the two groups. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that age (beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.13, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) length of stay (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.21, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Mini-Mental State Examination score (MMSE) (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.1, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and admission total FIM (beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.12, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) emerged as the only independent predictors of higher gain FIM scores at discharge. The finding suggests that elderly patients with recurrent ischemic stroke admitted to rehabilitation ward, showed similar FIM gain scores at discharge, compared with first-ever stroke patients.

Body composition measurements were obtained using a bioelectrical impedance analyzer (BIA); muscle strength was determined by handgrip strength (HS); and physical function was evaluated by the subjects\u2019 6-m gait speed (GS). In this study, HS and GS declined significantly after 55 years and very dramatically after 75 years. Appendicular SM index of <7.61\u00a0kg/m2 (males) and <6.43\u00a0kg/m2 (females); HS of <27\u00a0kg (males) and <16\u00a0kg (females); and GS of <0.98\u00a0m/s (males) and <0.88\u00a0m/s (females) were considered as low SM, low HS and low GS. Applying these suggested criteria to the study population, there were 9.55% and 6.63% of the subjects with low SM, 20.10% and 18.46% with low GS, and 14.07% and 15.38% with low HS in elderly males and females, respectively. Utilizing Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia (AWGS) criteria in our population results in a very low prevalence of low SM and low GS. If Western criteria for sarcopenia were adopted, the prevalence of low GS and low HS would be 2\u20134 times higher in the studied population, also exhibiting significant gender differences. These findings indicate that it is necessary to establish an outcomes-based and ethnic-specific set of reference values for the diagnosis of sarcopenia in elderly Chinese.",

     "abstract": "Measurement of inflammatory markers for risk stratification of vascular disorders has been the focus of numerous investigations worldwide, and usually reveals augmented levels of circulating cytokines/chemokines among carriers of classic risk factors for atherosclerosis. Nonetheless, this low-grade inflammatory milieu detected in aged individuals tends to be influenced by body composition. Moreover, cardiovascular risk factors have a complex genetic etiology, and disregarding the genetic heritage may produce spurious results owing to interethnic differences. In this complex scenario, our study was designed to verify the existence and strength of the association between selected mediators of systemic inflammation and classic risk factors of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).In a sample of post-menopausal older women, correlation analyses explored the association of circulating levels of IL1\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, IL8, IL10 and IL12 with atherosclerosis-related clinical/metabolic parameters, using age, body mass index (BMI), genetic ancestry estimates as standard correction factors. Further adjustment for use of therapeutic agents was applied when appropriate.Our analyses revealed association of log10-transformed IL-12 titers with VLDL-c levels (r\u00a0=\u00a0.192; p\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and with SBP (r\u2212.185; p\u00a0=\u00a0.003), and of log10-transformed IL-8 titers with GLY (r\u00a0=\u00a0.235; p\u00a0<\u00a0.001).Interpretation to the results account to a possible dysregulation of the PPAR signaling pathway to explain the association of IL12 and VLDL-c, and to IL8-driven mechanisms to promote dysglycemia. No previous report sought to investigate the relationship between this set of inflammatory markers and classic risk factors for atherosclerosis correcting for the heterogeneity in genetic admixture and body composition of Brazilian post-menopausal women.",

However, recent studies found that high selenium exposure may lead to adverse cardiometabolic effects, particularly in selenium-replete populations. We examined the associations of selenium status with changes in lipid levels in a 7-year follow up of an elderly Chinese cohort including participants from selenium-deplete areas.Study population consisted of 140 elderly Chinese aged 65 or older with nail selenium levels measured at baseline (2003\u20132005). Lipid concentrations were measured in fasting blood samples collected at baseline and the 7-year follow-up (2010\u20132012). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models was used to determine the association between baseline selenium status and changes in lipid levels from baseline to follow-up adjusting for other covariates.Mean (\u00b1standard deviation) baseline selenium concentration was 0.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0mg/kg.

The similar trends were seen with significant lipid changes in the 2nd and 3rd quartile groups.Selenium has modest beneficial effects on blood lipid levels in a population with relatively low selenium status.

We used growth-curve analyses on a subsample (n\u00a0\u2248\u00a02000) of the elderly from the Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Survey (CLHLS) who had longitudinal information from 1998 to 2005. Analyses controlled for a large set of individual and family characteristics. Our findings indicate that elderly who had relatively advantaged childhood socioeconomic status (SES) and who regularly engaged in physical and/or leisure activities had significantly healthier well-being than their respective counterparts on all dimensions considered. In addition, regularly participating in physical and/or leisure activities was associated with slow deterioration of health well-being among the Chinese elderly. The results indicate the potential benefits of engaging in physical and/or leisure activities, and consequently, the importance of implementing programs that promote such activities among elders in China.",

Results showed that the contribution of age to different diseases was varied. Increase in life expectancy was associated with relatively old age at the time of death for five of seven diseases. For cancer and diseases of the circulatory system, increase in life expectancy was associated with relatively younger age at the time of death. These findings indicate that chronic diseases may occur independently of aging and may have a programmed onset pattern.",

The baseline assessment, Wave 1, was conducted in 2008, and follow-up assessment, Wave 2, was conducted in 2011. We included participants who completed both waves and excluded those who met the following criteria: no adult children, living with adult children, cognitive impairment at either waves, and depression at baseline (n\u00a0=\u00a04398). We defined infrequent contact as <1 time per month face-to-face contact or <1 time per week phone contact and classified participants into four groups based on contact method and frequency. Depression was measured using the 15-item geriatric depression scales (SGDS-K).In multivariable logistic regression analysis, infrequent face-to-face and phone contact group had adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 1.86 (95% CI, 1.44\u20132.42) when compared with frequent face-to-face and phone contact group. Frequent face-to-face contact with infrequent phone contact group and infrequent face-to-face contact with frequent phone contact group had adjusted OR of 1.49 (95% CI, 1.12\u20131.98) and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.15\u20131.80), respectively, when compared with frequent face-to-face and phone contact group.These results propose that the risk of subsequent depression in elderly is associated with frequency of contact with non-cohabitating adult children. Moreover, the efficacy of face-to-face contact and that of phone contact were similar, while the group lacking both types of contact demonstrated the highest risk of depression.",

This prospective study investigated interactions between depressive symptoms, antidepressant use and physical and cognitive function measures in relation to injurious or multiple falls in a large sample of community-living older people. Four-hundred and eighty-eight community-dwelling older people aged 70 years and over, underwent a comprehensive psychological, cognitive and physiological assessment and were prospectively monitored for falls over a 12-month follow up period. Substantial depressive symptoms were defined by a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) (15-item) score \u22655 and fallers were defined as people who had at least one injurious or two non-injurious falls during follow-up. In univariate analyses, the presence of depressive symptoms (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.50; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.06\u20132.11), antidepressant use (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.56; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.08\u20132.27), high physiological fall risk (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.61; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.20\u20132.15) and poorer executive functioning (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.40; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.05\u20131.88) were significant risk factors for falls. Multivariate models revealed that depressive symptomatology and antidepressant use were independent of each other, and independent of the presence of a high physiological fall risk and poorer executive functioning in the prediction of falls. Fall risk increased with the number of risk factors present: i.e. by 55% in participants with any two risk factors (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.55; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.17\u20132.04) and by 144% in participants with three or four risk factors (RR\u00a0=\u00a02.44; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.75\u20133.43). The study findings indicate that higher depressive symptoms and antidepressant use predict falls over 12-months, independent of reduced executive and physical functioning. Treatment of depressive symptoms using non-pharmacological approaches should be considered as part of fall prevention programs, especially in populations at high risk of falls.",

Using a multivariate generalized linear model, we evaluated whether MoCA scores correlates with GCA, after adjusting for demographics, education, cardiovascular health (CVH) status, depression and edentulism.Out of 311 eligible persons, 241 (78%) were enrolled. Mean age was 69.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.5 years, 141 (59%) were women, 199 (83%) had primary school education, 175 (73%) had poor CVH status, 30 (12%) had symptoms of depression and 104 (43%) had edentulism. Average MoCA scores were 18.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7 points. GCA was mild in 108, moderate in 95, and severe in 26 persons. Total and most domain-specific MoCA scores were significantly worse in persons with moderate to severe GCA. In the multivariate model, mean MoCA score was associated with GCA severity (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a02.38, SE\u00a0=\u00a01.07, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027).MoCA scores associate with severity of GCA after adjusting for potential confounders, and may be used as reliable estimates of structural brain damage.

     "abstract": "Although hypertension is known to be a risk factor for AD, the effects of hypertension on brain function in AD patients are not well understood. We investigated alterations in resting-state functional connectivity according to the presence of hypertension in AD patients by using a method of correlation analysis based on a seed region in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). We also determined whether differences in resting-state connectivity were associated with gray matter atrophy.Thirty-seven AD patients (18 patients with hypertension and 19 patients without hypertension) underwent the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We obtained the PCC maps by a temporal correlation method, to identify alterations in the functional connectivity of the PCC in hypertensive group relative to non-hypertensive group. Voxel-based morphometry analysis was also applied to adjust the confounding effect of gray matter atrophy.We detected a decreased connectivity to the PCC in the regions of subgenual anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) in hypertensive group relative to non-hypertensive group. However, we observed a pattern of increased connectivity between the PCC and the left inferior parietal cortex in hypertensive group. After correction for gray matter atrophy, all detected regions still remained significant.Altered connectivity in AD patients with hypertension suggests the possibility that hypertension impairs resting-state functional connectivity of the AD brain, inducing a compensational process outside the impaired networks or disequilibrium in brain connectivity. This finding may account for an additional contribution of hypertension to the pathophysiology of AD.",

We investigated whether the association between the impedance index and total body water (TBW) was modified by hydration status as assessed by haematocrit and serum osmolarity.This was a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Newcastle 85\u00a0+\u00a0Cohort Study. Anthropometric measurements [weight, height (Ht)] were taken and body mass index (BMI) calculated. Leg-to-leg bioimpedance was used to measure the impedance value (Z) and to estimate fat mass, fat free mass and TBW. The impedance index (Ht2/Z) was calculated. Blood haematocrit, haemoglobin, glucose, sodium, potassium, urea and creatinine concentrations were measured. Serum osmolarity was calculated using a validated prediction equation.677 men and women aged 85 years were included. The average BMI of the population was 24.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2\u00a0kg/m2 and the prevalence of overweight and obesity was 32.6% and 9.5%, respectively.

However, the association between mastication and diet is far from conclusive. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the association of mastication with food and nutrient intake in the community dwelling elderly. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Scirus databases to obtain information on the epidemiological studies in this research area. The included publications were analyzed for study design, main conclusions, and strength of evidence. A comprehensive quality assessment of all the included studies (28 cross-sectional and 7 intervention studies) was performed. In 22 of the 28 cross-sectional studies, elderly persons with better mastication and dentition reported significantly higher consumption of foods and intake of some nutrients than those with poorer oral health; however, the remaining studies showed no such differences. Five of the 7 intervention studies with an intervention involving the provision of new prostheses did not show significant improvement in food and/or nutrient intake. These discrepant findings suggest that masticatory ability explains only part of the variance in food and nutrient intake of the elderly. Two intervention studies with the combination of prosthetic treatment and dietary intervention produced changes in intake of foods such as fruits and vegetables.",

Seventy-four physically independent elderly women, mean age 69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 years, were randomly assigned to three intervention groups: (1) MT (n\u00a0=\u00a023), (2) AG (n\u00a0=\u00a028), and (3) GG (n\u00a0=\u00a023). Each group performed physical training, including cardiorespiratory, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility and sensory-motor exercises for 12 weeks. To determine the effects on each intervention group, five postural balance tasks were performed on a force platform (BIOMEC 400): the two-legged stand with eyes open (TLEO) and two-legged stand with eyes closed (TLEC); the semi-tandem stand with eyes open (STEO) and semi-tandem stand with eyes closed (STEC) and the one-legged stand. Three trials were performed for each task (with 30\u00a0s of rest between them) and the mean was used to compute balance parameters such as center of pressure (COP) sway movements. All modalities investigated such as the MT, AG and GG were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) efficient in improving the postural balance of elderly women after 12 weeks of training. These results provide further evidence concerning exercise and balance for promoting health in elderly women.",

A prospective observational study was performed between Oct 2012 and May 2013. Patients with preexisting pressure ulcers on admission and those with hospital acquired pressure ulcers were recruited into the study. Information on patient demographics, functional status, nutritional level, stages of pressure ulcer and their complications were obtained. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to assess the risk of death in all patients. 76/684 (11.1%) patients had pre-existing pressure ulcers on admission and 30/684 (4.4%) developed pressure ulcers in hospital. There were 68 (66%) deaths by the end of the median follow-up period of 12 (IQR 2.5\u201314) weeks. Our Cox regression model revealed that nursing home residence (Hazard Ratio, HR\u00a0=\u00a02.33, 95% confidence interval, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.30, 4.17; p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), infected deep pressure ulcers (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.21, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.26, 3.87; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and neutrophilia (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.76; 95% CI 1.05, 2.94; p\u00a0=\u00a00.031) were independent predictors of mortality in our elderly patients with pressure ulcers. The prevalence of pressure ulcers in our setting is comparable to previously reported figures in Europe and North America. Mortality in patients with pressure ulcer was high, and was predicted by institutionalization, concurrent infection and high neutrophil counts.",

Two hundred and fifty-nine older adults (age 74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 years; 69% were women) living in Piemonte Region were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Socio-demographic and medical characteristics were captured by self-reported questionnaires. Physical frailty was assessed using the five criteria of Fried: shrinking, weakness, poor endurance and energy, slowness, and low physical activity level. HRQOL was measured with the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), using both the mental (MCS) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS). Among individual characteristics, gender was the best predictor for SF-36, the MCS, and the PCS, with values of R2 of 12.7%, 12.1%, and 8.8%, respectively. Among the five Fried's criteria, poor endurance and energy had the largest effect on HRQOL with values of \u0394R2 of 13.9% for SF-36, 13.4% for the MCS, and 9.4% for the PCS. Results highlighted the role of the individual characteristics and the single weight of the five components of physical frailty on HRQOL. This knowledge may give new insights about the relations between individual functioning and self-rated health, allowing the development of individualized and more effective preventive interventions for a healthy aging.",

We conducted a cross-sectional study. Plasma concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and soluble receptor for tumor necrosis factor alpha (sTNFR1) were determined by enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay. The muscle performance was measured using a isokinetic dynamometer and assessment of handgrip strength was performed using a Jamar\u00ae dynamometer. Functional performance was assessed through a walking speed test. Statistical analysis was performed using the Pearson or Spearman correlation. The association between the variables was determined by multiple regression analysis. 221 volunteers (71.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.93 years) participated in the study. Plasma levels of IL-6 (0.87\u00a0pg/mL) correlated with the power of the knee extensors (r\u00a0=\u00a00.14; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and the power of the knee flexors (r\u00a0=\u00a00.16; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01); the plasma levels of sTNFR1 (1051.70\u00a0pg/mL) did not correlate with any dependent variable.

There was no negative correlation between inflammatory mediators and muscle or physical performance in elderly women. These results may be explained by the fact that the cytokine levels did not reach the threshold needed to influence the muscle tissue and functionality of the participants.",

A random sample of 284 community-dwelling adults aged 65 and older were selected from a population-based register and divided into two age groups (65\u201374 and \u226575). The SPPB test, echocardiography and all-cause mortality were measured. The prevalence of cardiac dysfunction was 12% in the 65\u201374 group and 23% in the \u226575 group. The multivariate models could explain 15% and 23% of the SPPB score total variance for the 65\u201374 and \u226575 age groups, respectively. In the younger age group, the mean follow-up time was 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46 years, and the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for risk of mortality from cardiac dysfunction was 4.9. In the older age group, the mean follow-up time was 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61 years, and both cardiac dysfunction and poor physical performance were found to be independent predictors of mortality (adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a03.4 and adjusted HR\u00a0=\u00a04.2, respectively). The cardiac dysfunction prevalence in this elderly Russian population was found to be comparable to, or even lower than, reported prevalences for Western countries. Furthermore, the observed correlations between echocardiographic abnormalities and SPPB scores were limited.

Their balance and mobility were objectively evaluated on the basis of postural sway and time of STS measurements performed using a force platform. The main spatiotemporal parameters of gait (i.e. speed, stride and gait cycle duration, stance, swing and double support phase duration) were also acquired using a wearable inertial measurement unit.The results show that most gait parameters and STS time significantly improve in the VPA group but not in the LPA one. For the latter group a reduction only of swing phase duration was detected. PA also induced a generalized reduction of postural sway in both groups in the case of absence of visual input.These findings suggest that PA programs characterized by superior levels of intensity might be more suitable in generally improving static and dynamic daily motor tasks, while in terms of static balance acceptable results can be achieved even when only light activity is performed.",

Electrodes were placed on four muscles: the quadriceps muscle (rectus femoris), the hamstring muscle (semitendinosus), the tibialis anterior muscle, and the soleus muscle. The results show that the rates of increase in muscle activation in the tibialis anterior and soleus muscles according to baggage weight increase were higher than those in the quadriceps and hamstring muscles (<0.05). These results indicate that the heavier weight loads increase the activation of muscles that control the ankle joints causing muscle fatigue. Moreover, a decrease in balance ability through muscle fatigue can be a risk factor for falls. Thus, elderly people should be instructed not to carry heavy objects.",

However, the behavioral causal factor(s) of older adults\u2019 self-overestimation is unclear. We examined whether older adults\u2019 overestimation of step-over ability was mediated by an inactive lifestyle and/or poor executive function.A sample of 194 community-dwelling older adults was assigned to either a high (HG, once a day or more) or low (LG, every 2\u20133 days or less) frequency of going outdoors group. Executive function was determined by the Trail-Making Test (TMT). Both the HG and LG participants performed Step-Over Tests (SOT) in two ways: self-estimation of step-over ability and the actual step-over task. During the self-estimation task, participants observed the horizontal bar at a distance of 7 m and predicted the self-estimated maximum height (EH) of successful SOT trials. The motor task was then performed, determining the actual maximum height (AH) of successful trials.A total of 36.1% of LG participants failed to successfully perform SOT trials at their EH (i.e., overestimation), whereas only 11.3% of HG participants failed. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that SOT overestimation was associated with an inactive lifestyle (low frequency of going outdoors) but not with executive function. Analyses of fall experience showed that both executive function and lifestyle significantly correlated with SOT overestimation among fallers, whereas only lifestyle was significantly correlated among non-fallers.Our results suggest that an inactive lifestyle is a possible correlate of SOT overestimation among older adults, while executive function further influenced overestimation only among fallers.",

We considered general characteristics, including sex, age, education, marital status, employment, income, and residential region, and used self-rated health (SRH) as a generic indicator of health status. One-way ANOVA, t-test, and Scheff\u00e9\u2019s test (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.1) were employed to explore the difference between directly measured and self-reported values. Sensitivity and specificity values were used to assess the validity of obesity diagnoses based on self-reported body mass index (BMI: body weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters).The means of BMI differences were 1.3 (\u00b11.2)\u00a0kg/m2 among men and 1.8 (\u00b11.5)\u00a0kg/m2 among women. In men, the difference could be attributed to measured BMI and residential region; among women, age and education level influenced the discrepancy in BMI. Scheff\u00e9\u2019s test (\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.1) for multiple comparisons of group means revealed that women over the age of 65 years, with lower than middle-school education, who lived in rural areas, and had a measured BMI of 25\u00a0kg/m2 or more, were more likely to have significant BMI discrepancies. In contrast, for men, significant predictors were living in rural areas and being obese. Although adequate correlations were seen in self-reported BMI, they indicated low sensitivity, with 46.5% and 60.1% among males and females, respectively. However, specificities were very high, at 97.8% and 98.0% for males and females, respectively. The diagnostic performance of self-reported BMI is insufficient for assessing obesity prevalence among middle-aged or older Koreans.",

Cytokines and APOE genotype were measured in a subsample. Improvement was defined as either a 20% or three points increase in mini mental state examination (MMSE). From the 142 participants 55 (39%) experienced cognitive improvement, of which 30 (54.5%) had delirium while 25 had non-delirious acute cognitive disorder. Using bivariate statistics, subjects with more severe acute illness, lower insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels and more severe delirium were more likely to experience a \u226520% improvement in MMSE scores. When the criterion of cognitive improvement was a 3 point improvement in MMSE, those with more severe delirium, females and older were more likely to be improved. Longitudinal analysis using any criterion of improvement indicated that improvement was significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05) predicted by higher levels of IGF-I, lower levels of IL-1 (alpha and beta), lack of APOE epsilon 4 allele, and female gender. In conclusion, cognitive recovery during admission is not exclusively linked to delirium status, but reflects a range of factors. The character and relevance of non-delirious acute cognitive disorder warrants further study.",

However, the classical design of the task may also involve the influence of strategy use and efficiency of sentence processing in the possible differences between individuals. Therefore, the present study investigated activation and inhibitory processes in aging with two formats of an adapted Hayling task designed to reduce the involvement of these alternative factors. Thirty young adults (M\u00a0=\u00a020.7 years) and 31 older adults (M\u00a0=\u00a069.6 years) performed an adapted Hayling task including a switching block (i.e., unblocked design) in addition to the classical task (i.e., blocked design), and the selection of the response between two propositions. The results obtained with the classical blocked design showed age-related deficits in the suppression sections of the task but also in the initiation ones. These findings can be explained by a co-impairment of both inhibition and activation processes in aging. The results of the unblocked Hayling task, in which strategy use would be reduced, confirmed this age-related decline in both activation and inhibition processes. Moreover, significant correlations between the unblocked design and the Trail Making Test revealed that flexibility is equally involved in the completion of both sections of this design. Finally, the use of a forced-response choice offers a format that is easy to administer to people with normal or pathological aging. This seems particularly relevant for these populations in whom the production of an unrelated word often poses problems.",

According to the ADS, 10.0% (n\u00a0=\u00a020,978) of patients in the general population and 24.0% (n\u00a0=\u00a02231) of patients living in nursing homes was exposed to a prescription with a high or very high anticholinergic score (ADS\u00a0\u2265\u00a03). Hydroxyzine prescribed in 51.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a010,792) of them ranked first among drugs most often reported. In conclusion, PMIs and anticholinergic drugs were commonly prescribed in elderly living in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais Region. Improving the quality of prescriptions in the elderly appears necessary.",

     "abstract": "Frailty and anemia in the elderly appear to share a common pathophysiology associated with chronic inflammatory processes. This study uses an analytical, cross-sectional, population-based methodology to investigate the probable relationships between frailty, red blood cell parameters and inflammatory markers in 255 community-dwelling elders aged 65 years or older. The frailty phenotype was assessed by non-intentional weight loss, fatigue, low grip strength, low energy expenditure and reduced gait speed. Blood sample analyses were performed to determine hemoglobin level, hematocrit and reticulocyte count, as well as the inflammatory variables IL-6, IL-1ra and hsCRP. In the first multivariate analysis (model I), considering only the erythroid parameters, Hb concentration was a significant variable for both general frailty status and weight loss: a 1.0\u00a0g/dL drop in serum Hb concentration represented a 2.02-fold increase (CI 1.12\u20133.63) in an individual's chance of being frail. In the second analysis (model II), which also included inflammatory cytokine levels, hsCRP was independently selected as a significant variable. Each additional year of age represented a 1.21-fold increase in the chance of being frail, and each 1-unit increase in serum hsCRP represented a 3.64-fold increase in the chance of having the frailty phenotype. In model II reticulocyte counts were associated with weight loss and reduced metabolic expenditure criteria. Our findings suggest that reduced Hb concentration, reduced RetAbs count and elevated serum hsCRP levels should be considered components of frailty, which in turn is correlated with sarcopenia, as evidenced by weight loss.",

The aim was to analyze the frequency of severe hyponatremia (sodium concentration below 125\u00a0mmol/L), risk factors and mortality association in hospitalized older patients. A retrospective study was performed in older patients (over 65 years) with hyponatremia, diagnosed at admission in an Internal Medicine Department during one year. A control group of 127 older patients without hyponatremia was considered. Statistical analysis of the data gathered was made with SPSS Statistics 20. The main results were: a group of 1060 patients with age superior to 65 years was identified (representing 72.26% of total admissions); incidence of hyponatremia in those patients was 27.55% and severe hyponatremia was 5.94%; diagnosis of hyponatremia was mentioned in the discharge note in 66.67% of cases; mortality was 27.0%, against 16.0% in the control group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.057, Odds Ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.940); drugs were a significant risk factor (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), specially thiazide diuretics (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.774), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, OR\u00a0=\u00a04.097), proton-pump inhibitors (PPI) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.561) and spironolactone (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011, OR\u00a0=\u00a04.473); other relevant risk factors were: increased water intake (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), tube feeding (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), vomiting (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.492), cirrhosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008, OR\u00a0=\u00a010.862) and hyperhidrosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.542).

A secondary data analysis used the National Alliance for Caregiving and the American Association of Retired Persons caregiver survey dataset. Among randomly selected samples from 7 states in the U.S., 737\u00a0dyads of informal caregivers and frail older adults were selected based on age and medical conditions. Descriptive analyses and a hierarchical binary logistic regression analysis were performed. The study findings showed that the prevalence of home modification in the survey population was 42.20% in the United States. The home modifying group was likely to live together in a rural area, to consist of older care-recipients and younger caregivers, and to be Caucasian (p\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Physically functional impairments were the strongest factors of home modification (p\u00a0<\u00a0.01), while older adults living with heart disease were more likely to modify their homes (p\u00a0=\u00a0.03). In conclusion, older adults\u2019 and their caregivers\u2019 factors clearly affect home modification for health care at home. Our findings revealed that home modification represents an important contribution to multidisciplinary care and is based on comprehensive assessments, multidisciplinary decision-making processes, and careful planning of individualized interventions.

In this study, we investigated oxidative stress in intervertebral discs of Wistar rats in three different age groups: youth, adult, and geriatric. Age-related intervertebral disc changes were examined by histological analysis. In addition, oxidative stress was evaluated by assessing nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs). Intervertebral disc, but not serum, NO concentrations significantly differed between the three groups. Serum and intervertebral disc SOD activity gradually decreased with age. Furthermore, both serum and intervertebral disc MDA and AOPP levels gradually increased with age. Our studies suggest that oxidative stress is associated with age-related intervertebral disc changes.",

Two independent reviewers searched major electronic databases and extracted data on studies reporting quantitative correlates of PA participation in community dwelling adults with dementia. PA correlates were analyzed using the summary code approach within the socio-ecological model. Out of a potential of 118 articles, 12 met the eligibility criteria encompassing 752 participants. We conducted secondary analysis on nine data sets. Increased energy intake, resting metabolic rate, fat free mass, gait speed, global motor function, overall health related quality of life (HRQOL), physical HRQOL, higher levels of social functioning and reduced apathy were positively associated with PA. Taking \u2265four medications, dizziness, lower activities of daily living (ADL) function, a history of falls, less waking hours in the day, more autonomic problems and delirium were negatively associated with PA. Increasing age and lower global cognition were not consistently associated with PA participation. It is surprising that increasing age and lower global cognition do not appear to influence PA participation. All significant correlates should be confirmed in prospective studies with particular focus on the relationship of PA and gait speed, ADL function, falls history and dietary intake and the progression of frailty and nursing home admission as a priority.",

These focused on female Caucasian caregivers who were older than 60 years. The physical activity interventions improved stress, depression and burden in caregivers, but small sample sizes, short-term follow up and varying results limited the generalizability of the findings. There were few trials investigating male caregivers, and most care-recipients were people with dementia.Studies with caregivers of different ages and gender, with a range of physical activity interventions, are needed to clarify whether physical activity has psychological benefits for caregivers.",

Only three articles employed methods suitable to explore causal associations between changes in self-rated health and changes in personal relationships. Two of these articles suggested that widowhood leads to a reduction in self-rated health in the short term, while the remaining article suggested a causal relationship between self-rated health and negative emotional support from family or friends, but this was complex and mediated by self-esteem and sense of control.While there is an abundance of longitudinal aging cohorts available which can be used to investigate self-rated health and personal relationships over time the potential for these databases to be used to investigate causal associations is currently not being recognized.",

Search results were examined for articles involving the use of herbal products in the elderly population that met selection criteria.Initial searches yielded 1297 articles. Of these original results, only 16 met specific selection criteria. Twelve (75%) of studies identified were performed in North America. Nine studies (56.25%) were conducted in the United States. Seven of the studies were cross-sectional (43.8%). The most commonly reported were gingko biloba, garlic, ginseng, aloe vera, chamomile, spearmint, and ginger. Of these, gingko and garlic are the most commonly used among community-dwelling elderly. Both of these supplements have the potential to interact with anticoagulants and produce bruising or bleeding problems.The use of herbal supplements is common among the elderly, a population that takes a disproportionate share of prescription medications compared to that taken by younger populations. Among the problems uncovered by these studies was a lack of dialog between medical professionals and patients about the use of herbal supplements. Prescribers need to consider the use of herbal supplements and discuss the matter with their elderly patients when making decisions about pharmacological treatments.",

VLV is of the third survey of a repeated cross-sectional study, previously conducted in 1979 and 1994 in two French-speaking areas of Switzerland (the cantons of Geneva and Valais). Launched in 2011, VLV extends the original design to additional German and Italian-speaking areas and targets a sample of 4200 individuals. Quantitative data are collected by means of two questionnaires and a life history calendar, assessing current resources in multiple spheres of the individuals\u2019 life (e.g. household conditions, physical and psychological health, social relations, participation, and values) and their accumulation across the life course. The objectives of VLV are twofold: first it aims to provide an updated view of life and health conditions of the population aged 65 and older in Switzerland, with a major concern in assessing diversity and inequalities. Second, VLV aims to compare these conditions to those observed in 1979 and 1994; hence, it aims providing means to question the sustainability of the positive trends, reported in the previous surveys. VLV is a rare opportunity in Europe to acquire exhaustive and cardinal knowledge about the heterogeneity of the life conditions of the aged and their changes over the past 30 years.",

The SAFRM underwent a comprehensive scale development process. Ninety-one participants aged over 60 years were recruited from rehabilitation wards with their treating physiotherapist and occupational therapist. The results indicated a three factor structure of the scale corresponding to the theoretically developed intellectual, emergent and anticipatory SA sections which explained 50.26% of variance. The SAFRM demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a0.86\u2013.92), inter-rater reliability between clinicians (ICC\u00a0=\u00a0.61\u2013.87), and convergent validity with an SA interview (rs\u00a0=\u00a0.31\u2013.50). The SAFRM scores were significantly correlated with clinician-rated SA (rs\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.40 to \u2212.63) providing evidence of ecological validity.

However, it has been rarely validated in older adults and sporadically used in aging and health studies. Perceived gender role is a crucial part of a person's identity and an established determinant of health. Androgyny model suggests that those with high levels of both masculinity and femininity (androgynous) are more adaptive and hence have better health. Our objectives were to explore the validity of BSRI in an older Spanish population, to compare different standard methods of measuring gender roles, and to examine their impact on health indicators. The BSRI and health indicator questions were completed by 120 community-dwelling adults aged 65+ living in Aragon, Spain. Exploratory factor analysis was performed to examine psychometric properties of the BSRI. Androgyny was measured by three approaches: geometric mean, t-ratio, and traditional four-gender groups classification. Relationships between health indicators and gender roles were explored. Factor analysis resulted in two-factor solution consistent with the original masculine and feminine items with high loadings and good reliability. There were no associations between biological sex and gender roles. Different gender role measurement approaches classified participants differently into gender role groups. Overall, androgyny was associated with better mobility and physical and mental health. The traditional four groups approach showed higher compatibility with the androgyny model and was better able to disentangle the differential impact of gender roles on health.",

In order to determine the psychometric properties, reliability and validity were assessed through administration of the German adaptation of the ABC-D16 to participants twice, 10 days apart, and comparison of the ABC-D16 and the ABC-D6 with functional measures of balance and mobility (one-leg stance; 10\u00a0m walk; TUG; Fullerton Advanced Balance Scale (FAB)), physical activity (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)), physical fitness (30\u00a0s arm curl, 30\u00a0s chair stand, 6\u00a0min walk), cognition (Trail-Making-Test (TMT)), falls status, and quality of life (SF36). Factor analyses suggested a 1-factor solution for the ABC-D6 scale (explained variance 79.8%). Internal consistency (.95) and test-retest reliability (.98) for the ABC-D6 scores were excellent. Scores on the ABC-D6 were significantly lower than on the ABC-D16, but ABC-D16 and ABC-D6 scores were highly correlated (.94). There was an increasing difference in the ABC-scores between men and women with increasing age. Fallers reported lower balance confidence than non-fallers.

     "abstract": "Disability is an important health outcome for older persons; it is associated with impaired quality of life, future hospitalization, and mortality. Disability also places a high burden on health care professionals and health care systems. Disability is regarded as an adverse outcome of physical frailty. The main objective of this study was to assess the predictive validity of the eight individual self-reported components of the physical frailty subscale of the TFI for activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) disability. This longitudinal study was carried out with a sample of Dutch citizens. At baseline the sample consisted at 429 people aged 65 years and older and a subset of all respondents participated again two and a half years later (N\u00a0=\u00a0355, 83% response rate). The respondents completed a web-based questionnaire comprising the TFI and the Groningen Activity Restriction Scale (GARS) for measuring disability.Five components together (unintentional weakness, weakness, poor endurance, slowness, low physical activity), referring to the phenotype of Fried et al., predicted disability, even after controlling for previous disability and other background characteristics. The other three components of the physical frailty subscale of the TFI (poor balance, poor hearing, poor vision) together did not predict disability. Low physical activity predicted both total and ADL disability, and slowness both total and IADL disability. In conclusion, self-report assessment using the physical subscale of the TFI aids the prediction of future ADL and IADL disability in older persons two and a half years later.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study cross-sectional study comprising 132 community dwelling elderly (\u226560 years) was to identify sarcopenia prevalence in the Brazilian elderly, utilizing different diagnostic criteria and analyze agreement between criteria. Sarcopenia was assessed by nine muscle mass diagnostic criteria, by two muscle strength criteria and also by the combination of criteria. Prevalence was analyzed for each method, along with differences by gender and age group through calculation of the prevalence ratio (PR) and confidence interval (CI) 95%. The Kappa coefficient was used to analyze the level of agreement between all criteria. Sarcopenia prevalence varied between 60.6% and 8.3% with the application of muscle mass criteria, and between 54.2% and 48.8% with the application of strength criteria. The combination muscle mass\u00a0+\u00a0strength resulted in a decrease of prevalence in all criteria, varying between 36.6% and 6.1%. There was an increase in prevalence according to age groups for all methods. Prevalence was higher for men according to three muscle mass criteria, and higher in women for strength criteria and by two combined mass\u00a0+\u00a0strength criteria. The best level of agreement was obtained for two methods that utilized dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The prevalence of sarcopenia differs by gender and age and definition criteria. The low agreement levels obtained between methods and the different prevalence values encountered indicate the necessities of an operational definition for the estimation of sarcopenia in different population.",

We used bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to measure muscle mass, grip strength to measure muscle strength, and usual walking speed to measure physical performance in a baseline study. \u201cSarcopenia\u201d was characterized by low muscle mass and low muscle strength or low physical performance. \u201cPresarcopenia\u201d was characterized only by low muscle mass. Subjects who did not have any of these deficiencies were classified as \u201cnormal.\u201d We then administered a questionnaire assessing age, sex, household status, chronic illness, lifestyle-related habits, and fall. This study showed the prevalence of fall was 16.9% and 21.3% in men and women, respectively, while that of sarcopenia was 13.4% and 14.9% in men and women, respectively. In men and women, the prevalence of sarcopenia was higher among those who had fallen. A logistic regression analysis using age, body fat, current drinker status, and physical inactivity for men, and age, body fat, smoking, and diabetes for women as covariate variables revealed that sarcopenia was significantly associated with a history of fall. The odds ratio for fall in the sarcopenia group relative to the normal group was 4.42 (95%CI 2.08\u20139.39) in men and 2.34 (95%CI 1.39\u20133.94) in women. This study revealed sarcopenia to be associated with falling in elderly Japanese. Sarcopenia prevention interventions may help prevent falls among elderly individuals.",

Fifty-eight older adults [age: 71.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2 years; body mass index (BMI): 28.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4\u00a0kg/m2] completed the testing procedures. Sarcopenia-related body composition was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and participants performed a discontinuous cycle ergometry test to determine PWCFT. Functionality assessments included maximal isometric grip strength (GRIP) and sit-to-stand (STS) repetitions in 30\u00a0s. Muscle quality (MQ) was defined as GRIP relative to appendicular lean soft tissue (ALM), while skeletal muscle index (SMI) was defined as ALM/height2. Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationships among dependent variables. PWCFT showed significant relationships with ALM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.57), SMI (r\u00a0=\u00a00.47), body fat percentage (BF%) (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.50), GRIP (r\u00a0=\u00a00.49), and STS (r\u00a0=\u00a00.44).

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a ballroom dancing program on the postural balance of institutionalized elderly residents. The sample consisted of 59 sedentary elderly residents of long-stay institutions who were randomly assigned to a ballroom dancing experimental group (EG, n\u00a0=\u00a030) or a control group (CG, n\u00a0=\u00a029). The ballroom dancing program consisted of three 50-min sessions each week on alternate days over a 12-week period. The dances included the foxtrot, waltz, rumba, swing, samba and bolero. The medical records of the subjects were reviewed to determine the number of falls they experienced in the three months prior to the intervention. Postural static balance was assessed using a Lizard (Med. EU., Italy, 2010) stabilometric and posturometric platform. Only patients in the EG lost a significant amount of weight (\u0394\u00a0=\u00a0\u22122.85\u00a0kg) when comparing the pre- and post-test postural balance assessments. The intergroup comparison revealed a reduced lower limb weight distribution difference in the EG post-test compared to the CG post-test (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). In the intragroup comparison, the EG patients experienced significantly fewer falls post-test relative to pre-test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). This improvement was not observed for patients in the CG. In the intergroup analysis, we observed fewer falls in the EG post-test compared to the CG post-test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Therefore it was conclude that sedentary elderly people living in long-term institutions can improve their balance via a ballroom dancing program.

Participants\u2019 level of fear of falling, physical mobility, self-perceived personal wellbeing and social participation were compared before and after completing the 8-week intervention and then at a 2-month follow-up. The findings showed that Tai Chi both with and without CBI had a similar effect on reducing elderly people's fear of falling, but only Tai Chi plus CBI had a positive effect on participants\u2019 self-perceived personal wellbeing. Tai Chi both with and without CBI had no effect on participants\u2019 self-perceived social participation and mobility. Apart from a slight improvement in participants\u2019 self-perceived personal wellbeing, other outcome effects were similar for Tai Chi with and without CBI. This finding raises a question about the additive effects of combined intervention over Tai Chi alone in reducing elderly people's fear of falling. In view of the higher demand for resources and manpower to implement a combined intervention, further study is still required to confirm the potential additional benefits of this combined intervention prior to recommending it to community services.",

The purpose of the present study were to investigate PA stability overtime, and to examine if changes in self-reported physical function (dynamic indicator) are better predictors of trajectories of PA than baseline measures of physical function (static indicator). This is a prospective postal survey with two time-point follow-ups: 12 and 38 months. Participants were older adults aged \u226560 years, and members of the medical insurance scheme of the French national education system. They responded to a self-report questionnaire on PA and general health status at three different times: baseline, 12- and 38-month follow-ups (n\u00a0=\u00a0243 for the 12-month follow-up; n\u00a0=\u00a0164 for the 38-month follow-up). Overtime analyses of PA showed a moderate-to-good stability with regard to both duration and volume of PA; however, a decrease in stability for vigorous PA was found between 12- and 38-month follow-ups. Both baseline measure and changes in physical function predicted PA trajectories, but magnitudes of associations were stronger for the dynamic indicator. Moreover, change in physical function was the only predictor of both becoming active compared with Inactive (reduced probability) and becoming inactive compared to Active (increased probability). In conclusion, a dynamic indicator of physical function is a better predictor of PA variation than static indicators.",

From 1999 to 2001, a cohort of 1000 community-dwelling adults, aged \u226565 years, representing a random sample of Medicare beneficiaries, stratified by ethnicity, sex, and urban/rural residence were recruited. BZD use was assessed at an in-home visit. Every six months thereafter, study outcomes were assessed via telephone for 8.5-years. Mobility was assessed with the Life-Space Assessment (LSA). Functioning was quantified with level of difficulty in five basic activities of daily living (ADL: bathing, dressing, transferring, toileting, eating), and six instrumental activities of daily living (IADL: shopping, managing money, preparing meals, light and heavy housework, telephone use). Pain was measured by frequency per week and the magnitude of interference with daily tasks. All analytic models were adjusted for relevant covariates and mental health symptoms. After multivariable adjustment, baseline BZD use was significantly associated with greater difficulty with basic ADL (Estimate\u00a0=\u00a00.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.04\u20130.74), and more frequent pain (Estimate\u00a0=\u00a00.41, 95%CI: 0.09\u20130.74) in the total sample and declines in mobility among rural residents (Estimate\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.67, t(5,902)\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.98, p\u00a0=\u00a00.048), over 8.5 years. BZD use was prospectively associated with greater risk for basic ADL difficulties and frequent pain among African-American and non-Hispanic white community-dwelling older adults, and life-space mobility declines among rural-dwellers, independently of relevant covariates. These findings highlight the potential long-term negative impact of BZD use among community-dwelling older adults.",

Informal caregivers were interviewed by mailed paper questionnaires at the same time as patients. We estimated costs per unit from hospital information systems and nationally representative research. Mean healthcare costs were \u20ac30k euro per person per year, with one third for initial hospital stay (\u20ac9,8k), one third for formal healthcare costs between hospital discharge and twelve month follow up (\u20ac10,3k), and one third for informal healthcare costs between hospital discharge and twelve month follow up (\u20ac9,5k). Informal and formal healthcare costs were almost double for people with the highest risk score compared to people not at risk (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Older patients with high risk scores at hospital admission have substantially higher formal and informal care costs in the year after initial hospital admission than people with low risk scores.

The purpose of this research study was to analyze the contact with healthcare professionals, self-perceived mental health problems and unmet needs, as reported by a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling adults. We report a cross-sectional analysis of all the respondents of the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing aged 55 years and older (N\u00a0=\u00a03178). Results indicated that 306 (9.6%) participants had a DSM-IV classifiable mental disorder based on self-identified symptoms over the preceding 12 months. Of these, 146 (48%) reported that they had not consulted a healthcare professional to deal with their mental health problems. Among those who consulted with a healthcare professional, the general practitioner was the main point of contact. Medication and psychotherapy/counseling were the most frequent form of help obtained. Informational and instrumental help, such as help to sort out practical problems and to look after oneself, were the most reported unmet needs. These results suggest a gap in the provision of healthcare services for mental health problems directed toward the specific needs of aging adults. The reported unmet needs might be met by increasing awareness amongst healthcare professionals regarding mental health problems in later stages of life and by improving the access of older people to the services commonly provided by multidisciplinary teams.",

The increase in the elderly population also leads to an increase in medico-legal problems, as well. Autopsy is of high importance for determination of cause of death in clinical and forensic cases. The purpose of this study was to find out general characteristics elderly deaths by examining forensic autopsy records.Out of 7033 forensic autopsies performed between years of 2007 and 2011, 1324 were elderly deaths and were included in the scope of the study. The records of public prosecutor office, crime scene investigation and autopsy findings were examined.The majority of victims (70.6%) were male, while 29.4% were female, with a male to female ratio of 2.4/1. Victims\u2019 ages ranged between 65 and 96 years, and the mean age was 74.8 years. A great number of presented elderly deaths were due to unnatural causes, followed by natural deaths cases. Out of unnatural deaths, 63.2% were related to accidents, 23.7% were suicides, and remaining 13.1% were homicides. More than half (56.6%) of all suicidal deaths were due to hanging. Of natural deaths, the majority (82.7%) were due to cardiovascular system disease.In the presented series the cause of death was determined in 90.9% of all elderly deaths, which validates the need for a forensic autopsy. Data obtained through autopsy procedures is of high importance for death statistics.",

One of these strategies is the segmentation of population in risk groups through standardized tools. This paper is a retrospective study aimed to determine the viability of the implementation of the screening tools Probability of Repeated Admission \u2013 Pra \u2013 and The Community Assessment Risk Screen \u2013 CARS \u2013 to detect patients at risk of hospital readmission in a sample of 500 elderly people (65+) from the VHS in Spain.

The most important results indicate that both instruments predict with high efficacy the proportion of patients not readmitted (negative predictive value between 91% and 92%). Moreover, the tools performed with a moderate efficiency being the Pra less sensitive (54%) and more specific (81%) than CARS (with a sensitivity and specificity of 64%). Results from this study suggest that the application of instruments as Pra and CARS are of interest to the Valencian Health Administration as they can be a good strategy to improve the management of elderly patients at risk with comorbidities and guiding clinical decision.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether depressive symptoms are related to cerebral oxygenation during cognitive tasks in older adults. In this study, 80 elderly subjects (73.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4 years, 34 males) were evaluated using multi-channel Near-infrared spectroscopy. Concentration changes (mmol\u00a0cm/l) in oxy-hemoglobin (oxy-Hb), as the most reliable available indicator of changes in regional cerebral blood flow, in the right and left prefrontal cortex were measured during the Trail Making Test Part B (TMT-B). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the short Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Subjects were divided into a depressive group (GDS greater than or equal to 6) and non-depressive group (GDS lower than 6). In results, Oxy-Hb activation during the TMT-B was significantly smaller in the depressive group (n\u00a0=\u00a013) than in the non-depressive group (n\u00a0=\u00a067) in both the right and left prefrontal cortex.

In old age, financial literacy has been associated with a wide range of positive characteristics; however, the neural correlates remain unclear. Recent work has suggested greater co-activity between anterior\u2013posterior medial brain regions is associated with better brain functioning. We hypothesized financial literacy would be associated with this pattern. We assessed whole-brain functional connectivity to a posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) seed region of interest (ROI) in 138 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Results revealed financial literacy was associated with greater functional connectivity between the PCC and three regions: the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), the left postcentral gyrus, and the right precuneus. Results also revealed financial literacy was associated negatively with functional connectivity between the PCC and left caudate. Post hoc analyses showed the PCC\u2013vmPFC relationship accounted for the most variance in a regression model adjusted for all four significant functional connectivity relationships, demographic factors, and global cognition. These findings provide information on the neural mechanisms associated with financial literacy in old age.",

The study recruited 182 people, including 143 healthy volunteers and 39 Alzheimer disease patients. All underwent conventional magnetic resonance imaging and susceptibility weighted imaging sequences. The groups were divided according to age. Phase images were used to investigate iron deposition in the bilateral head of the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus and putamen, and the angle radian value was calculated. We hypothesized that age-related iron deposition changes may be different between Alzheimer disease patients and controls of the same age, and that susceptibility weighted imaging would be a more sensitive method of iron deposition quantification. The results revealed that iron deposition in the globus pallidus increased with age, up to 40 years. In the head of the caudate nucleus, iron deposition peaked at 60 years. There was a general increasing trend with age in the putamen, up to 50\u201370 years old. There was significant difference between the control and Alzheimer disease groups in the bilateral globus pallidus in both the 60\u201370 and 70\u201380 year old group comparisons. In conclusion, iron deposition increased with age in the globus pallidus, the head of the caudate nucleus and putamen, reaching a plateau at different ages.

The purpose of the article was to evaluate the Meuser and Marwit Caregiver Grief Inventory (MM-CGI-50) for use in Polish family caregivers and to find out determinants of grief of family caregivers of AD individuals living in Poland. A sample of 151 spouse and adult child caregivers of community-dwelling AD patients (95 females and 56 males) was interviewed to determine the influence of such factors as caregiver's age, gender, family relation to the care recipient (CR) and caregiving-related changes in caregiver's working time, leisure time and material status to find out the impact of caregiving role on intensity of caregiver grief. Caregiver grief was measured by means of MM-CGI-50. Additionally, carers were administered a questionnaire including patient's and caregiver's demographics. Also, CR's dementia assessment was informant-based and determined with investigator-administered clinical dementia rating (CDR) scale. Of all analyzed factors, only caregiver's informant dementia rating significantly influenced caregiver grief. To conclude, the effect of caregiver's age, gender, family relation to the CR and caregiving-related changes in caregiver's working time; leisure time and material status could not be found.

     "abstract": "Frailty is a geriatric syndrome characterized by the clinical presentation of identifiable physical alterations such as loss of muscle mass and strength, energy and exercise tolerance, and decreased physiological reserve. Individuals with one or two of these alterations are defined as prefrail. The clinical features of prefrail older individuals have been investigated to a lesser extent compared to the frail population, even though this intermediate stage may provide insights into the mechanisms involved in the physical decline associated with aging and it is considered to be potentially reversible. We performed searches in the Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cinahl, and Cochrane databases from January 1995 to July 2013 for papers about the identification of prefrail people aged 65 and older published either in English or Spanish, and the reference lists of from the articles retrieved were pearled in order to identify any which may have been missed in the initial search. Two independent reviewers extracted descriptive information on frailty criteria and outcomes from the selected papers: of the 277 articles retrieved from the searches and 25 articles retrieved from pearling, 84 met the study inclusion criteria. The prevalence of prefrailty ranges between 35% and 50% in individuals aged over 60, is more common in women, and the age and the number of comorbidities in these individuals is similar to their frail counterparts. Weakness is the most prevalent symptom in prefrail individuals although there are some sex differences. Some serum biomarkers seem to discriminate prefrail from non-frail individuals but further research would be required to confirm this.",

Empirical studies were included if they explored barriers to or strategies for recruitment or retention of adults aged 60-plus who were identified as frail, vulnerable or housebound. Two researchers independently determined the eligibility of each abstract reviewed and assessed the level of evidence presented. Data concerning challenges encountered (type and impact) and strategies used (type and impact) were abstracted.Of 916 articles identified in the searches, 15 met the inclusion criteria. The level of evidence of the studies retained varied from poor to good. Lack of perceived benefit, distrust of research staff, poor health and mobility problems were identified as common challenges. The most frequently reported strategies used were to establish a partnership with staff that participants knew and trusted, and be flexible about the time and place of the study. However, few studies performed analyses to compare the impact of specific challenges and strategies on refusal or drop-out rates.This review highlights the need to improve knowledge about the impact of barriers and strategies on recruitment and retention of frail older adults. This knowledge will help to develop innovative and cost-effective ways to increase and maintain participation, which may improve the generalizability of research findings to this population.",

The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the TFI to a Danish context, and to test face validity of the Danish version by cognitive interviewing. An internationally recognized procedure was applied as a basis for the translation process. The primary tasks were forward translation, reconciliation, back translation, harmonization and pretest. Pretest and review of the preliminary version by cognitive interviewing, were performed at a local community center and in an acute medical ward at the University Hospital in Aalborg, Denmark respectively. A large agreement regarding meaning of the items in the forward translation and reconciliation process was seen. Minor discrepancies were solved by consensus. Back translation revealed unclear wording in one matter. The harmonization committee agreed on a version for cognitive interviewing after revision of minor issues and thirty-four participants were interviewed. Two issues became evident and these were revised. The cognitive interviews and final lay-out resulted in minor adjustments as text type size, specific font, and lining for optimizing readability. In conclusion, we consider the TFI to be translated in such rigorous manner that the instrument can be further tested in clinical practice.

For this reason it is important to assess body composition and the effects of these alterations in obese elderly women. The purpose of this study was to assess body composition, physical performance and muscle quality in active elderly women. Cross-sectional study included 75 elderly women (29 eutrophic and 46 obese) 65\u201380 years old. Body composition was evaluated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and the physical performance was determined by 6-minute walk test (6MWT), handgrip strength (HS) and knee extension strength (KES). Muscle quality was calculated as the ratio between muscle strength and lean mass. Fat free mass, lean mass, fat mass and percent body fat were significantly higher in the obese group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, the obese group showed a poorer performance than the eutrophic group in the 6MWT (432.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a066.13\u00a0m and 472.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a074.03\u00a0m, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).

However, there is limited data on the relationship between skeletal muscle mass and arterial stiffness targeting an elderly population. Thus, we investigated the association between skeletal muscle mass and arterial stiffness in an elderly Korean population. This study used data from the Korean Social Life, Health and Aging Project which started in 2011. In this cross-sectional study, 180 men (mean age 71.7) and 247 women (mean age 70.9) were included. Arm and leg muscle masses were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Radial augmentation index, a noninvasive measure of arterial stiffness, was assessed by radial pulse wave analysis. The relationship between skeletal muscle mass and augmentation index was investigated by multiple linear regression analysis. In men, limb muscle mass was significantly and inversely associated with augmentation index (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.07% per 1\u00a0kg muscle mass, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) when adjusted for age. This inverse association remained after additional adjustment for body mass index, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, fasting glucose, insulin, smoking and alcohol intake (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.69%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). In women, the inverse association between limb muscle mass and augmentation index was less prominent (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.59%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.030), and the association disappeared when fully adjusted (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.32%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.304).

Femoral strength index (FSI) and bone mineral density (BMD) of the whole body, lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and total lean tissue mass (TLTM) and total fat mass (TFM) were determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-DXA.

     "abstract": "Older adults with joint pain and comorbidity are especially at risk of becoming functionally impaired. Therefore, we studied the frequency and severity of functional limitations and identified potential modifiable determinants that may reduce functional limitations. A prospective cohort study of older adults (\u226565 years) with joint pain and comorbidity provided cross-sectional baseline data (n\u00a0=\u00a0407). Based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model, we measured Physical Functioning; PF, (Instrumental) Activities of Daily Living; (I)ADL, and participation. Apart from examining the frequency and severity, we identified determinants of functional limitations with multivariate regression analyses, by adding determinants in two steps: (1) only physical determinants, (2) physical and psychosocial determinants. Limitations in PF, ADL, IADL and participation were present in 66%, 31%, 61% and 47% of the participants, respectively. About 22% reported limitations on all four measures. Of the physical determinants, especially frailty and higher pain intensity were related to functional limitations. Remarkably, adding psychosocial determinants to the model weakened some of these relations. The psychosocial determinants were especially related to poor PF (i.e. anxiety symptoms, activity avoidance and poor general health perception) and participation restrictions (i.e. depressive symptoms, less social support). An inverse relation was present between self-efficacy and both outcomes. In conclusion, our sample reported substantial levels of functional limitations. More depressive symptoms, more activity avoidance and less social support were indicative of more functional limitations, whereas higher perceived self-efficacy was indicative of better functioning. Such psychosocial determinants should receive more attention in research.",

     "abstract": "Although trunk function is known to be critical for maintaining balance during gait, a detailed evaluation regarding the relationship between trunk function and mobility has not been performed. We previously reported that the ability of quick lateral trunk movements in a seated position reflects mobility in elderly people. In this study, we further examined whether trunk movement in the anterior\u2013posterior direction is also a determinant of mobility. In addition, the correlation between range of lateral trunk movement and mobility was also examined. One hundred and forty community-dwelling elderly participants (73.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2 years) were enrolled in this study. We performed various trunk movement tests in a seated position, such as the seated side tapping test (SST), the seated anterior\u2013posterior tapping test (APT), and the lateral sitting functional reach test (sitting reach test). Maximum gait speed and the timed up and go test (TUG) were performed to determine mobility. Parameters of trunk movement were compared. SST and APT showed moderate significant correlations with both maximum gate speed and TUG, while the sitting reach test weakly correlated (SST r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.58, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, APT r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.63, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01, sitting reach test r\u00a0=\u00a00.30, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Moreover, multiple regression analysis revealed that SST and APT were independent indicators of both maximum gate speed and TUG, while the sitting reach test was not. These findings indicate that quickness, regardless of the direction of the movement, is more important than range in determining mobility in the elderly.",

OOHB indicators were assessed based on a multi-method assessment strategy, using both GPS (global positioning system) tracking technology and structured self-reports. Environmental mastery and positive as well as negative affect served as well-being indicators and were assessed by established questionnaires. Three theoretically postulated OOHB dimensions of different complexity (out-of-home walking behavior, global out-of-home mobility, and out-of-home activities) were supported by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). We also found in the DAT group that environmental mastery was substantially and positively related to less complex out-of-home walking behavior, which was not the case in MCI and CH individuals. In contrast, more complex out-of-home activities were associated with higher negative affect in the DAT as well as the MCI group, but not in CH persons. These findings point to the possibility that relationships between OOHB and well-being depend on the congruence between available cognitive resources and the complexity of the OOHB dimension considered.",

As a secondary objective, we considered whether there are any differences depending on the type of activities, according to the International Classification of Functioning (ICF) mobility domains.Seventeen community-dwelling men and women aged 70 years old or over were interviewed by means of a questionnaire containing 55 items covering the ICF mobility domains. The participants responded to the items while thinking aloud, saying what led them to give a specific answer about their level of difficulty. Inductive content analysis was conducted and categories, subthemes and themes were identified.Causes of difficulty (pathologies, impairments, symptoms) and accommodations (task modifications and use of aids) were the two themes identified; and their importance (and that of the subthemes included) varied across the types of activity. All the participants said that they had no difficulty in at least one task, despite mentioning changes in the way they performed them.Older people's opinions were consistent with theoretical models of disability and with the standard practice of measuring functional limitations by asking about the degree of difficulty; however, the design of these measures needs to be improved in order to detect perceptions of no difficulty in the presence of task modification.",

A cross-sectional survey with n\u00a0=\u00a0394 community-dwelling older adults in Victoria, Australia was undertaken. Participants were provided with detailed descriptions of four evidence-based falls prevention strategies and for each were asked whether they felt that the strategy would be effective in preventing falls for people like them, and then whether they felt that the strategy would be effective for preventing falls for them personally. Follow-up questions asked why they thought the strategy would be more effective for people like them than for them personally where this was the case. We found the \u201cbetter for others than for me\u201d perception was present for between 25% and 34% of the strategies investigated. Participants commonly said they felt this way because they did not think they were at risk of falls, and because they were doing other activities they thought would provide equivalent benefit. Strategies to promote participation in evidence-based falls prevention strategies may need to convince older adults that they are at risk of falls and that what activities they are already doing may not provide adequate protection against falls in order to have greater effect.",

     "abstract": "Increasing numbers of researchers are finding that loneliness is a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and several variables have been found to be closely related to the experience of loneliness among elders. However, much of the research has focused on the general older population, with no research to date focusing on minority populations. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence and the correlates of loneliness among a community-dwelling older Mexican American population. This study used a three-item loneliness scale to determine the prevalence of loneliness. Pearson's correlation and linear regression analyses were used to determine the cross-sectional association between sociodemographic, interpersonal relationship and health variables with the scale. Data used came from the most recent wave (2011) of the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiological Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE). A total of 873 Mexican Americans completed the loneliness scale. The age range was from 80 to 102, with a majority (65%) female. The mean score on the scale was 4.05 (range 3\u20139), indicating relatively low levels of loneliness. Regression results indicate that depressive symptoms, cognitive status, and living alone were significantly associated with higher loneliness scores. Being married and having a confidante were significantly associated with lower loneliness. Age, number of close relatives and frequency of contact were not associated with loneliness. Findings suggest that among community-dwelling Mexican American older adults, loneliness has multiple determinants. Loneliness is a significant public health topic and clinicians should be aware of the various factors that can affect loneliness.",

Despite growth of initiatives targeting risk factors associated with potentially avoidable hospital readmissions, the impact of dementia on the likelihood of rehospitalization is poorly characterized. Therefore, the primary objective of this retrospective cohort study was to investigate whether dementia was an independent predictor of 30-day readmissions. Administrative claims data for all admissions to Rhode Island hospitals in 2009 was utilized to identify hospitalizations of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease or other dementias. Demographics, measures of comorbid disease burden, and other potential confounders were extracted from the data and the odds of 30-day readmission to any United States hospital was calculated from conditional logistic regression models. From a sample of 25,839 hospitalizations, there were 3908 index admissions of Medicare beneficiaries who fulfilled the study criteria for a dementia diagnosis. Nearly 20% of admissions (n\u00a0=\u00a05133) were followed by a readmission within thirty days. Hospitalizations of beneficiaries with a dementia diagnosis were more likely to be followed by a readmission within thirty days (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.18; 95% CI, 1.08, 1.29), compared to hospitalizations of those of without dementia.

We validated this equation in the KLoSHA. The r2 of the estimated ASM was 0.890. This BIA equation provides valid estimates of ASM in older Korean adults.",

Participants reported incident falls monthly for 3.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 years. N\u00a0=\u00a099 (73%) participants fell 355 times during the follow-up period (mean fall rate 83 per 100 person years). We observed a reduced odds ratio for multiple falls (0.83, 95% CI 0.70\u20130.98) and a reduced hazard ratio for time to first fall (0.90, 95% CI 0.83\u20130.98), according to quadriceps strength. There was also a significantly shorter time to first fall for those with low quadriceps strength (<7.0\u00a0kg; lowest tertile) compared with those with normal quadriceps strength (estimated means [95% CI] 1.54 [1.02, 2.06] vs. 2.23 [1.82, 2.64] years; P\u00a0=\u00a00.019), but not for those with low (<1.0\u00a0m/s) vs. normal gait speed (P\u00a0=\u00a00.15). Quadriceps strength is a significant predictor of incident falls over three years amongst community-dwelling older women at high risk of fracture.

Better results for Walkers were observed in most subjective and objective outcome measures. Walkers were less likely to feel generally tired, more likely to have better physical fitness and to have the maximum score on the Falls Efficacy Scale, less likely to feel unstable during walking outdoors and less likely to be dependent or unsafe in ADL. Walkers of both genders performed better in the following tests: chair stand, one leg stance, maximal walking speed and six min walking. The difference between Walkers and Non-Walkers was greater in men. In general, older women and men who walked at least 30\u00a0min daily/almost daily showed better results in most health-related outcomes, ADL and functional performance than people who walked less.

For this study, we conducted a secondary analysis of data from a prospective cohort study of 351 patients aged 65 years and older. Participants were recruited from five surgical and medical wards at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan and assessed at three time points: within 48\u00a0h of admission, before discharge, and 6 months post-discharge. The course of depressive symptoms was dynamic with symptoms increased spontaneously and substantially during hospitalization and subsided at 6 months after discharge, but still remained higher than at admission. Overall, 26.7% of older patients at hospital discharge met established criteria for minor depression (15-item Geriatric Depressive Scale (GDS-15) scores 5\u20139) and 21.2% for major depression (GDS-15 scores >10). As the strongest associated factors, functional dependence and nutritional status influenced depressive symptoms following hospitalization. Depressive symptoms at discharge showed significant cross-lagged effects on functional dependence and nutritional status at 6 months after discharge, suggesting a reciprocal, triadic relationship. Thus, treating one condition might improve the other. Targeting the triad of depressive symptoms, functional dependence, and nutritional status, therefore, is essential for treating depressive symptoms and improving the overall health of older adults hospitalized for acute illness.",

The onset of IADL and ADL disabilities were estimated as the follow-up survey year that these functional disabilities were first noted, or the follow-up survey year that the participant was noted as having died. A Cox proportional hazards model, with time-dependent covariates, was used to analyze the association between the time of onset of the functional disabilities and the health-related service use, after controlling for age, gender, education, marital status and time varying chronic disease status. This study found that an increase in the number of services used by the participants resulted in fewer IADL and ADL disabilities.

Linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between frailty and well-being. There was a significant negative correlation between frailty and well-being; the correlation coefficient between FI and CASP-19 scores was \u22120.58.

Of the residents, 17.5% (N\u00a0=\u00a0245) had vision impairment and they were not able to read regular print. Those with vision impairment were older, more often females, and malnourished according to MNA. They had lower BMI, and suffered more often from dementia and chewing problems than those without vision impairment. In logistic regression analysis controlling for age, gender, chewing problems and dementia, vision impairment was independently associated with resident's malnutrition (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.80\u20133.51). According to our results older residents in assisted living with vision impairment are at high risk for malnutrition. Therefore it is important to assess nutritional status of persons with vision impairment. It would be beneficial to repeat this kind of a study also in elderly community population.",

High activeness in health and security dimensions lowers the risk of being abused while those who are low active in community participation have the lowest risk of being abused in both rural and urban areas. Being literate (elderly with primary/secondary education) is revealed to be a significant factor that lowers the risk of abuse in both rural and urban areas. These results imply a need for educational programs that bolster positive and proper community interaction, in turn promoting a secure later life for elders, and reducing burden for families and society.

Those with stroke had significantly lower PGCMS scores than those without (10.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8 SD vs. 12.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.0 SD, p-value 0.008), but 38.5% had high morale. A multiple linear regression analysis showed that low morale was independently associated with depression, angina pectoris and impaired hearing among those with stroke and another multiple linear regression, among those without a stroke history, showed that low morale was independently associated with depression, pain and poor nutritional status. A large proportion of very old have had stroke which is associated with reduced morale. Low morale among those with stroke was independently associated with depression, angina pectoris and impaired hearing which could be the focus for future intervention studies.",

Calorie restriction (CR) prevented age-related deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation and improved cognitive function at old age. In the paper we investigated the ceramide and sphingomyelin (SM) levels in the brain regions, which are critical for learning and memory of 3- and 24-month-old rats, as well as the correction of sphingolipid turnover in the brain of old rats, by means of the CR diet and modulators of SM turnover. Using the [methyl-14C-choline]SM, the neutral, but not the acid SMase activity has been observed to increase in both the hippocampus and brain cortex of 24-month-old rats with respect to 3-month-old animals. Age-dependent changes of neutral SMase activities were associated with ceramide accumulation and SM level drop in the brain structures studied. Treatment of the rats with the CR diet or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) or \u03b1-tocopherol acetate, but not an inhibitor of acid SMase imipramine, reduced the ceramide content and neutral SMase activity in the hippocampus of 24-month-old animals with respect to control rats of the same age. These results suggest that redox-sensitive neutral SMase plays important role in SM turnover dysregulation in both the hippocampus and neocortex at old age and that the CR diet can prevent the age-dependent accumulation of ceramide mainly via neutral SMase targeting.",

Our results on the total plasma antioxidant potential, PMRS in erythrocytes, protein and lipid peroxidation, and intracellular reduced GSH provide evidence that oxidative stress is minimal till approximately one-third of the total lifespan (8 months) and there is a spurt in oxidative stress between 8 and 12 months.

Subjects with LTCF-acquired infections were more likely to die than those without infections. Besides, subjects with lymphopenia and long-term use of feeding tube and/or urinary catheters were significant risk factors for LTCF-acquired infections. However, poorer functional status and occurrence of lower respiratory tract infections were significant predictive factors for all-cause mortality. In conclusion, the period prevalence of LTCF-acquired infections was higher in Taiwan than previous reports, but the incidence was similar. In addition to traditional risk factors, lymphopenia, a surrogate indicator for immunosenescence, was a significant risk factor for LTCF-acquired infections.",

Most of the available literature is focused on exercise benefits for the risk of falls, attention, and gait-speed; however, there is a lack of evidence reporting the exercise effects on balance in healthy older adults during dual-task performance. The objective of this study was to critically review the existing evidence of a potential relationship between exercise and improvement of static and dynamic balance during dual-task in healthy older adults and secondary outcomes in other physical and cognitive indices. A systematic search using online databases was used to source articles. Inclusion criteria included articles classified as randomized controlled trials (RCT), controlled trials (CT) and uncontrolled trials (UT). Moreover, the studies had to include an exercise or physical activity protocol in the intervention. Eight studies met the eligibility criteria and included 6 RCTs, 1 CT, and 1 UT. Several limitations were identified, mainly focused on the lack of a common and standardized method to evaluate the balance during the dual-task performance. Additionally, exercise protocols were extensively different, and generally lacked reporting measures. Preliminary findings show that the current body of evidence does not support that exercises used in these interventions entail clear and noteworthy benefits on static or dynamic balance improvements during dual-task performance. Innovative measures and exercise programs may need to be developed before efficacious screening and treatment strategies can be used in clinical settings.",

Functional cardiac abnormalities have been reported in patients with NAFLD. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether these findings are present also in elderly people. We tested 171 subjects aging more than 65 years, enrolled in a prospective study on CV risk reduction, for laboratory examination, abdominal ultrasound for evaluation of hepatic steatosis and standard echocardiography for determining morphological and functional cardiac parameters. Higher BMI, serum levels of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and visceral adipose tissue and lower serum levels of HDL-cholesterol were significantly associated with NAFLD. Furthermore, subjects with NAFLD had higher prevalence of diabetes, pathological waist-circumference, insulin-resistance and positive ATP-III criteria. While NAFLD had only a borderline significant association with higher end-diastolic thicknesses of left-ventricle posterior wall (edPW) and right-ventricle wall, higher values of edPW and end-diastolic thickness of interventricular septum were significantly correlated with glucose levels above 100\u00a0mg/dl, hypertension, MS and insulin-resistance. Moreover, subjects with MS and/or pathological waist-circumference had a lower early-diastolic mitral annular motion, whereas those with insulin-resistance had lower E/A ratio and early-diastolic filling peak velocity. Regression analyses identify hypertension and pathological waist-circumference as factors independently associated to pathological edPW, and hypertriglyceridemia to pathological left-ventricle mass. In conclusion, an ultrasonographic diagnosis of NAFLD in old subjects may be an \u201calert\u201d on the coexistence of multiple CV risk factors and on the presence of possible alterations of cardiac morphology and diastolic function.",

This multi-site cross-sectional study used visual inspection and direct microscopy to diagnose the type of skin eruption. Subjects were residents of facilities covered by long-term care insurance schemes in Japan. Of the 171 residents enrolled in this study, 72.5% had a skin eruption. Only 4.8% of participants had tinea in the buttocks; 2.4% had buttock candidiasis. In those with a nail abnormality, 58.3% of residents had tinea unguium. For tinea pedis, residents who had any form of interdigital or plantar region skin eruption, 22.5% and 31.4% of residents were positive, respectively. The prevalence of observed skin mycoses was: buttock candidiasis 1.8%; buttock tinea 3.5%; tinea unguium 56.2%; interdigital tinea pedis 20.5%; and plantar tinea pedis 22.5%. The very low proportion of residents with mycoses in the buttocks suggests that anti-inflammatory agents, such as steroids, should be used as first choice. Our observation that not all residents with skin eruptions on the feet had tinea, should remind clinicians to perform direct microscopy before initiating antifungal treatments.",

In total, 2449 elderly individuals with available health indicators were examined in latent class analysis (LCA), and 2217 elderly community-dwellings with complete socio-demographic data were analyzed by multinomial logistic regression. Four health latent classes were identified which included 1066 (43.5%) people in the High Comorbidity (HC), 152 (6.2%) in the Functional Impairment (FI), 252 (10.3%) in the Frail (FR), and 979 (40.0%) in the Relatively Healthy (RH) group. Multinomial logistic regressions revealed socio-demographic characteristics among health classes. The variables associated with an increased likelihood of being in the FR group were age, female, and living with families. They were also correlated to ethnicity and educations. Apart from age and gender, the Functional Impairment group was less likely to be ethnicity of Hakka, more likely to live with others than were the RH group. The HC group tended to be younger, with higher educations, and more likely to live in urban area than the Functional Impairment group. The correlations between health classes and socio-demographic factors were discussed. The health status of elderly people includes a variety of health indicators. A person-centered approach is critical to identify the health heterogeneity of elderly people and manage their care needs by targeting differential aging.",

Life expectancy with and without cognitive impairment was calculated using the Sullivan method and prevalence estimates from data collection at two points (2000 and 2010) of the Health, Well-Being, and Aging (SABE) Study. Results indicate that 60-year-old men in S\u00e3o Paulo in 2000 could expect to live 14.8 years and women 17.9 years without cognitive impairment. By 2010, life expectancy without cognitive impairment had increased to 17.1 years for men and 20.0 years for women. Length of life with cognitive impairment differed by gender (2.3 years for men and 3.7 years for women at age 60 in 2010). However, the absolute number of years with cognitive impairment remained relatively constant with age. The results indicate a trend for improvements in life expectancy without cognitive impairment over time in S\u00e3o Paulo.

Methods: Seventy-six right-handed healthy subjects were allocated to three age groups and tested with a modified version of the Box and Block Test (BBT). We focussed on two aspects. First, the BBT was evaluated with respect to its ability to assess MC. Second, we were interested whether performance of motor imagery (MI) and real execution with one hand would modify performance with the other hand. To explore MC, we measured motor execution (ME) time as the time needed to perform the BBT, and MC time as the time difference between ME and the time needed for imagination of task execution. The BBT was performed with both hands consecutively to study transfer effects from one hand to the other and then repeated with the first hand for practice effects. Results: The age group with the oldest subjects exhibited a slower BBT performance and a less precise MC than the other 2 age groups. Irrespective of the age, MC abilities could be transferred to the other hand, whereas ME only improved when repeating the task with the same hand. Conclusions: The BBT was able to demonstrate an age-related decline of dexterity and MC. Intermanual transfer of MI abilities occurred even after a single run.",

     "abstract": "Although HTN is the most important factor in the pathogenesis of SVaD, about 20% of patients with SVaD do not have HTN. We hypothesize that SVaD without HTN may have strong risk factors other than HTN, and the study on this group can elucidate the risk factors for SVaD. We included 332 patients with SVaD from the database of the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea (CREDOS) study. Among them, 26.2% of patients (87 out of 332) had no history of HTN. We analyzed the differences in risk factors, clinical features, and survival time of SVaD according to HTN. Contrary to our expectations, SVaD without HTN had less known vascular risk factors such as diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, and obesity. In addition, SVaD without HTN had different clinical features including less depression, focal neurological signs or symptoms and more features of disinhibition. However, although SVaD without HTN had less known vascular risk factors that can shorten survival times, the survival times did not differ according to the presence of HTN. SVaD without HTN may be a unique subtype of SVaD and can be a target group for studies of unknown risk factors for SVaD.",

A stratified cluster random sampling method was performed, and 689 ischemic stroke patients (over 40 years of age) were enrolled. All of the patients had received a neuropsychological assessment battery to assess cognitive function and self-designed questionnaires to collect relevant information. According to the cognitive status, the patients were divided into two groups, a case group and a control group. The caregivers of the patients were given a questionnaire concerning the awareness of and attitudes toward VCI. In this study, we determined that the prevalence of VCI was 41.8%. Aging, paraventricular white matter lesion (WML), macroangiopathy, high levels of alcohol, a lack of hobbies, and excessive sleep were risk factors for vascular cognitive impairment no dementia (VCIND). A high level of education, manual-work, low level of alcohol use, regular health checks, a vegetable-based diet, and more fruit and milk were protective factors for VCIND. Living alone, hyperlipidemia, transient ischemic attack, a family history of stroke, and brain atrophy were risk factors of vascular dementia (VD). A high educational level, a vegetable-based diet, and tea were protective factors for VD. The general public awareness of VCI was found to be insufficient, and there was a prejudice toward and lack of funding for the care of VCI patients. The prevalence of VCI is high in ischemic stroke patients, and there are different impact factors at different stages. Despite the high prevalence of VCI, the general public awareness is limited. Appropriate prevention measures should be developed to reduce the prevalence of VCI.",

The purpose of this study was to validate the mobility hierarchical disability categorization model (an abbreviated model) by investigating its concurrent validity with the multidimensional hierarchical disability categorization model (a comprehensive model) and triangulating both models with physical performance measures in older adults. 604 community-dwelling older adults of at least 60 years in age volunteered to participate. Self-reported function on mobility, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and activities of daily living (ADL) domains were recorded and then the disability status determined based on both the multidimensional hierarchical categorization model and the mobility hierarchical categorization model. The physical performance measures, consisting of grip strength and usual and fastest gait speeds (UGS, FGS), were collected on the same day. Both categorization models showed high correlation (\u03b3s\u00a0=\u00a00.92, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and agreement (kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Physical performance measures demonstrated significant different group means among the disability subgroups based on both categorization models. The results of multiple regression analysis indicated that both models individually explain similar amount of variance on all physical performances, with adjustments for age, sex, and number of comorbidities. Our results found that the mobility hierarchical disability categorization model is a valid and time efficient tool for large survey or screening use.",

     "abstract": "Identifying the decline in functional ability and preventing disability is the critical element of the quality of life of an old age. However, the lack of contextual scale to assess the decline in functional capacity is a major issue. Objective of this study is to design the functional ability assessment scale for elderly people in India and test its psychometric properties. Random sample of 659 individuals above 60 years of age from western part of India was recruited. This paper outlines the construction, reliability and validity of a newly developed 14 item scale named as Pune-Functional Ability Assessment Tool (Pune-FAAT). The factors were extracted using the principal component analysis. Two-factor-structure of scale was accepted after applying the K1 rule, scree plot and parallel analysis method. The two factor structure yielded variance of 64.4%. The psychometric properties of the scale were examined using confirmatory factor analysis. The scale has an excellent reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1 0.928) and very good test\u2013retest reliability (r\u00a0=\u00a00.884). Each subscale demonstrated good internal consistency (Subscale I \u2013 Cronbach's \u03b1 0.938 and Subscale II \u2013 Cronbach's \u03b1 0.762). Excellent convergent validity with Standford's health assessment questionnaire (r\u00a0=\u00a00.959). Discriminant validity was very good as FAAT index showed significant difference in young adults (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD 1.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24) and older adults (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD 1.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.70). This new measure is a potentially valuable research tool for investigating older adult's functional ability to perform basic and complex daily activities.",

Data for 1111 older person (aged 75+ with activity of daily living (ADL) limitation)\u2013caregiver dyads from Singapore were used. The outcome variable was dichotomous (caregiver clinically significant depressive symptoms [CSDS]: yes/no) in the primary analysis and continuous (caregiver depressive symptoms score) in the sensitivity analysis. The causal steps approach assessed for the mediation of the association between older person cognitive impairment (yes/no) and the outcome variable through the two potential mediators. A bootstrapping approach calculated point estimates and confidence intervals (CIs) of the indirect (\u223cmediated) effects. Variation of the indirect effects by caregiver\u2013older person relationship was also assessed. In the primary analysis, the causal steps approach supported older person BPS and functional limitations as mediators. The bootstrapping approach confirmed both as significant mediators, though BPS (indirect effect odds ratio (OR) 1.32 [95% bootstrap CI 1.19,1.48]; %mediation: 70.6%) was a stronger mediator than functional limitations (1.04 [1.01,1.11]; %mediation: 11.5%). Variation of the indirect effects by caregiver\u2013older person relationship was not supported. Results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed these results. We conclude that while caring for an older person with cognitive impairment is detrimental for the caregiver's mood, management of associated BPS and functional limitations, especially the former, among such older persons may reduce depressive symptoms among their caregivers.

Comparisons of the adjusted mean scores on the EQ-5D index between normal and abnormal SPPB groups were performed. We selected the quartiles of the EQ-5D index variables for the analysis. The association between the EQ-5D index and SPPB abnormality was examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Additionally, the associations between gait speed and chair stand time and the EQ-5D index were examined using the same analysis.Four hundred and twenty-two subjects were included in the analysis. The adjusted means for the EQ-5D index were significantly lower when the SPPB score was abnormal (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022 for men, p\u00a0=\u00a00.047 for women). An abnormal SPPB score was significantly associated with the lowest quartile of EQ-5D index score (adjusted OR 3.54 in the lowest quartile for men; adjusted OR 2.50 and 3.37 in the lowest and second quartiles for women). Gait speed was significantly associated with the EQ-5D index for participants of both sexes, but standup time was associated with the EQ-5D index only for men.An abnormal SPPB score was associated with lower QOL. Thus, the SPPB has the potential to be used as an early predictor of declining QOL in clinical settings and epidemiological studies.",

There is a need to examine the impact of these programs in real life settings where diverse populations exist.

A semi structured telephone interview was conducted with 23 participants 12 months following the completion of a 15 week falls prevention program tailored to diverse communities in Victoria, Australia and provided in both a group and home based format. Reported benefits of the falls prevention program included physical improvements in joint flexibility, mobility and balance and enjoyment derived from both the exercises and socialisation. Recall of the educational component was minimal as were ongoing behavioral changes to reduce the risk of falling other than exercise. Participation in sustained exercise for falls prevention following the completion of the program was also inconsistent. Future improvements of such programs could focus upon ensuring the exercises prescribed are sufficiently challenging for each individual in order to be of physical benefit, altering the educational style to be goal directed and more enjoyable, and integrating further strategies to support sustained participation in falls prevention behavioral changes. Linking participants with alternate ongoing exercise opportunities or potential sources of ongoing support may be advantageous in enhancing long term participation in exercise for falls prevention following cessation of the program.",

In this study, the anti-aging activities of mussel oligopeptides were evaluated using H2O2-induced prematurely senescent MRC-5 fibroblasts. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and flow cytometry displayed that exposure to H2O2 led to the loss of cell viability and cell cycle arrest. In addition, H2O2 caused the elevation of senescence-associated-\u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activity and formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHF). It was found that pretreatment with mussel oligopeptides could significantly attenuate these properties associated with cellular senescence. Mussel oligopeptides also led to the increase of glutathione (GSH) level and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u0394\u03c8m) recovery. In addition, mussel oligopeptides resulted in an improvement in transcriptional activity of peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1), nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). This study revealed that mussel oligopeptides could protect against cellular senescence induced by H2O2, and the effects were closely associated with redox cycle modulating and potentiating the SIRT1 pathway.

Cross-sectional baseline data were used from the Frail older Adults: Care in Transition (ACT) study in the Netherlands, consisting of 1137 community dwelling frail older adults aged 65 and above. Patients were recruited through 35 primary care practices. Self-perceived care needs were assessed using the Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE). Socio-demographic characteristics included age, sex, partner status and educational level. Health-related characteristics included functional capacity, hospital admissions, chronic diseases and the degree of frailty. Frail older adults reported on average 4.2 care needs out of 13 CANE topics, of which 0.5 were unmet. The physical and environmental domain constituted the highest number of needs, but these were mostly met. Unmet needs were mainly found in the psychosocial domain. Regression analyses revealed that Activities of Daily Living (ADL) limitations and a higher frailty score were the most important determinants of both met and unmet care needs. A younger age and a higher educational level were associated with the presence of unmet care needs.In conclusion, most frail older adults in primary care report to receive sufficient help for their physical needs.

Curiously, no study until now has examined the associations and dissociations between these dimensions in elderly people (with or without dementia). These questions were addressed in two studies. In the first study, we explored the distribution of scores and the relationships between the three dimensions of apathy in 56 patients with dementia, focusing mainly on lack of initiative and lack of interest. Apathy was hetero-evaluated with the Apathy Inventory (AI), a scale widely used to assess the apathy dimensions in aging. In the second study, given the AI's limitations, we investigated in more detail the relationship between lack of initiative and interest in 115 elderly people using a new questionnaire specifically designed to assess these two dimensions. Results showed that lack of initiative was closely related to lack of interest (Study 1). Although we used a more specific questionnaire, these facets of apathy did not constitute two separable dimensions, but reflected a common main factor of apathy in aging (Study 2). Thus, the distinction between lack of initiative and lack of interest seems questionable. Only a multifactorial approach that includes the various psychological factors involved in apathy would enable one to gain a better understanding of the different manifestations of apathy and to highlight possible dissociations between them.",

The main aim of this study was to investigate the racial and socioeconomic differences in sexual activity among older married Malaysians. Data for this study consisting of 1036 older married adults aged 60 years and older were obtained from the nationwide community-based cross-sectional survey entitled \u201cDeterminants of Wellness among Older Malaysian: A Health Promotion Perspective\u201d, conducted in 2010.

The results showed that 57.3% (95% CI: 54.3\u201360.3) of the respondents (61.6% of men and 50.6% of women) had engaged in sexual intercourse during the last 12 months. The adjusted multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ethnicity and educational attainment were independently and significantly associated with sexual activity, after controlling for the possible confounding effects of chronic medical conditions and demographic characteristics. The findings from this study do support the notion that sexuality is a lifelong need and cultural teachings and formal education may have important role in maintaining the quality of sexuality in later life.",

The \u201cfunctional autonomy measurement system\u201d (SMAF) was used to evaluate functional autonomy. The physical capacities measured (tests used) were: biceps and quadriceps strength (Microfet dynamometer), grip strength (Martin vigorimeter), unipodal balance, changing position & walking (timed up and go), normal & fast walking (four-meter walking speed) and changing position (chair stand). Correlation and multiple linear regression analyses adjusted for age, depressive symptoms and body composition were performed.On average, participants were aged 73 years and had mild to moderate functional autonomy loss. In women, after controlling for age, depressive symptoms and body composition, greater functional autonomy was best explained by faster changing position & walking skills and superior biceps strength (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.46; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After controlling for depressive symptoms, faster changing position & walking skills and better unipodal balance best explained greater functional autonomy in men (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.21; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).According to these results, physical capacities are moderately associated with functional autonomy among independent older adults, especially women.",

A total of 311 non-institutionalized men and women aged 60 years and older, from the Geriatrics Service of the Peruvian Navy Medical Center (Centro M\u00e9dico Naval \u201cCirujano Mayor Santiago T\u00e1vara\u201d) were assessed between May and October 2010. Frailty was defined as having two or more of the following components: (1) unintentional weight-loss, (2) weakness (lowest 20% in grip-strength), (3) self-reported exhaustion, and (4) slow walking speed (lowest 20% 8-m walk-time in seconds). Additionally, information on socio-demographic factors, medical conditions, depressive symptoms, disability, and cognitive function were obtained. Of the 311 participants, 78 (25.1%) were not frail, 147 (47.3%) were pre-frail, and 86 (27.8%) were frail. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that older age, being married, falls in the last year and disability were factors significantly associated with being frail. We conclude that prevalence of pre-frail and frail status in Peruvian Navy Veterans and family members is high. Our data reports risk factors for frailty that have been reported in the past in other population groups. A larger sample and longitudinal follow-up are needed to design and implement comprehensive geriatric interventions that can benefit Peruvian Navy Veteran's older adults at risk of becoming frail.",

We tested whether objective measures of total daily activity decline more rapidly in older adults. This prospective, observational cohort study included 519 community-dwelling older persons from across metropolitan Chicago participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Repeated total daily activity measures (leisure and non-leisure physical activity) were derived from actigraphic recordings for up to 10 days. Generalized estimating equation models which controlled for demographics measures were employed. At baseline, age was inversely related with the level of total daily activity (estimate, \u22120.014, S.E. 0.002, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). During up to 6 years of follow-up, total daily activity declined by about 0.070\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 activity counts/day/yr (estimate \u22120.065, S.E. 0.005, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Total daily activity declined 3% more rapidly for each additional year of age at baseline (estimate \u22120.002, S.E. 0.001, p\u00a0=\u00a00.027). Thus, total daily activity declined almost twice as fast in an individual 91 years old at baseline versus an individual 71 years old. A higher level of education was associated with a slower rate of decline (estimate 0.004, S.E. 0.002, p\u00a0<\u00a00.018). The associations of age and education with the rate of declining total daily activity were unchanged when controlling for baseline level of motor and cognitive function, other late-life activities and chronic health conditions. These data suggest that total daily activity in very old adults declines more rapidly with increasing age. Thus, physical inactivity is likely to become a larger problem in our aging population.",

     "abstract": "Females with Parkinson's disease (PD) are at increased risk for frailty, yet are often excluded from frailty studies. Daily electromyography (EMG) recordings of muscle activity can dissociate stages of frailty and indicate functional decline in non-neurological conditions. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether muscle activity can be used to identify frailty phenotypes in females with PD. EMG during a typical 6.5-h day was examined in biceps brachii, triceps brachii, vastus lateralis and biceps femoris on less-affected PD side. Muscle activity was quantified through burst (>2% maximum exertion, >0.1\u00a0s) and gap characteristics (<1% maximum exertion, >0.1\u00a0s). Differences across frailty phenotype (nonfrail, prefrail, frail) and muscle (biceps brachii, BB; triceps brachii, TB; vastus lateralis, VL; biceps femoris, BF) were evaluated with a 2-way repeated measure ANOVA for each burst/gap characteristic. Thirteen right-handed females (mean\u00a0=\u00a067\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 years) were classified as nonfrail (n\u00a0=\u00a04), prefrail (n\u00a0=\u00a06), and frail (n\u00a0=\u00a03) according to the Cardiovascular Health Study frailty index (CHSfi). Frail females had 73% decreased gaps and 48% increased burst duration compared with nonfrail. Decreased gaps may be interpreted as reduced muscle recovery time, which may result in earlier onset fatigue and eventually culminating in frailty. Longer burst durations suggest more muscle activity is required to initiate movement leading to slower movement time in frail females with PD. This is the first study to use EMG to dissociate frailty phenotypes in females with PD during routine daily activities and provides insight into how PD-associated motor declines contributes to frailty and functional decline.",

     "abstract": "Fear of falling and mobility restrictions have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of older adults. Because older African American adults are at increased risk for various modifiable health problems, understanding potential constraints on their overall health and mobility is critical in this population. The current study investigated this issue by analyzing a dataset of 449 older African American adults (mean age\u00a0=\u00a072.3 years) living in Detroit. We characterized and investigated the relationships among the following falls- and health-related variables: previous falls, falls efficacy, mobility, self-rated health (SRH), and depression and well-being. As a whole, participants reported moderate health and well-being, little depression, few mobility problems (mean\u00a0=\u00a08.4/40), and very high falls efficacy (mean\u00a0=\u00a094.9/100) despite the fact that a quarter of the sample experienced a fall within the past year. Correlation results indicated that previous falls, falls efficacy, mobility, SRH and depression and well-being were all inter-related. Regression analyses revealed that higher falls efficacy was more closely associated with better SRH than was having previously fallen. Findings suggest that improving falls efficacy in older African American adults may be beneficial to their mobility and overall health and well-being. Further, by asking a single-item SRH question, clinicians may be able to quickly identify older African American adults who have low falls efficacy and are at high risk for falling.",

The aim of this study was to prospectively examine the long-term relations between falls and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and life satisfaction (LS) over six years in the general elderly population.One thousand three hundred and twenty-one subjects (aged 60\u201393 years), from the general population in the south of Sweden, were included in a baseline assessment and a follow-up after six years. HRQoL was measured with the SF-12 and LS with the life satisfaction index A (LSI-A). The differences in mean scores between fallers at baseline (n\u00a0=\u00a0113) and non-fallers were statistical analyzed. Furthermore, the prediction of falls on the outcomes was analyzed using a multivariate linear regression model adjusted for multiple confounding factors.Fallers scored significant lower in HRQoL and LS at baseline and after six years, compared to non-fallers, especially in the SF-12 physical component (p\u00a0=\u00a0<0.001). In the linear regression analysis, one or more falls at the baseline predicted a significant reduction in the SF-12 physical component at the follow-up assessment (B-Coefficient \u22121.8, 95% CI \u22123.4 to \u22120.2). In conclusion, falls predict a long-term reduction in the physical component of HRQoL in the general elderly population. Over six years, fallers had a notable chronic lowered score in both HRQoL and LS, compared to non-fallers. This long-term depression of elderly fallers in these aspects may be more extent than previous assumed.",

Although we previously proposed risk factors for adverse outcome in syncope, after accounting for the presence of these risk factors, it is unclear whether age is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes in syncope.

We conducted a prospective, observational study enrolling consecutive patients with syncope. Adverse outcome/critical intervention included hemorrhage, myocardial infarction/percutaneous coronary intervention, dysrhythmia, antidysrhythmic alteration, pacemaker/defibrillator placement, sepsis, stroke, death, pulmonary embolus or carotid stenosis. Outcomes were identified by chart review and 30-day follow-up. We found that of 575 patients, adverse events occurred in 24%. Overall, 35% with risk factors had adverse outcomes compared to 1.6% without risks. Age\u00a0\u2265\u00a065 were more likely to have adverse outcomes: 34.5% versus 9.3%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001.

However, among patients with no predefined risks, there were no statistical differences: 3.6%; 0.28\u201313% versus 1%; 0.04\u20133.8%. This was confirmed in a regression model accounting for the interaction between age\u00a0>\u00a065 and risk factors. Although the elderly with syncope are at greater risk for adverse outcomes overall and in patients with risk factors, age\u00a0\u2265\u00a065 alone was not a predictor of adverse outcome in syncopal patients without risk factors.

The Functional outcome of atrial fibrillation (AF) and non-atrial fibrillation (Non-AF) patients were assessed by the Functional Independence Measurement scale (FIM\u2122) at admission and discharge.

A total of 1015 subjects for whom complete sets of data were available were employed for statistical analysis. Analysis of variance for the continuous variables and \u03c72 analysis for that categorical variance were performed. Multiple logistic analysis was performed with the factors with p values of <0.2 in the \u03c72 analysis of burden reduction. A total of 68.8% of the caregivers indicated that the care burden was reduced by the introduction of the LTCI care services, and 86.8% of the caregivers were satisfied with the LTCI care services. A lower age of caregivers, a more advanced need classification level, and more satisfaction with the services were independently associated with a reduction of the care burden. In Japanese LTCI, the overall satisfaction of the caregivers appears to be relatively high and is associated with the reduction of the care burden.",

This study aimed to investigate whether body composition and the prevalence of obesity and sarcopenia among elderly leprosy survivors with no or mild physical impairment differ from those of the general population. A total of 36 leprosy survivors aged 65\u201390 years with no or mild physical impairment were recruited. Individuals matched for sex, age, and height were selected as a control group from the Fourth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Anthropometric characteristics, body composition, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), modified skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and the prevalence of obesity and sarcopenia were compared between the leprosy survivors and the control group. Compared to the control group, the leprosy survivors had higher body weight, BMI, total fat mass, and total fat percentage. The leprosy survivor group also had lower ASM (P\u00a0=\u00a00.035) and SMI (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) values. Comparison of the composition of regional body parts showed that the lean body mass of the legs was lower in the leprosy survivor group even though this group had higher body weight. The leprosy survivor group also had a significantly higher prevalence of sarcopenia than the control group (38.7% vs. 5.6%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). These findings suggest that leprosy survivors are at greater risk of developing obesity and sarcopenia than healthy individuals. Further researches are required to investigate causes and mechanisms of sarcopenia in leprosy survivors.",

We investigated reliability and validity of the DMSS Dutch version. Elderly patients who had undergone hip fracture surgery received the DMSS and the Delirium Rating Scale Revised-98 (DRS-R-98). A diagnosis of delirium was defined according to the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Among 146 patients, 46 (32%) patients were diagnosed with delirium (mean age 86.3 years; SD 5.2). The internal consistency of the DMSS was acceptable (Cronbach's alpha\u00a0=\u00a00.72). If an item was removed at random the internal consistency of the scale remained the same. Similarly the concurrent validity of DMSS was good (Cohen's kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.73) while for each motor subtype the Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.58 to 0.85. The sensitivity and specificity of DMSS to detect each subtype ranged from 0.56 to 1 and from 0.88 to 0.98, respectively. This study suggests that the Dutch version of the DMSS is a reliable and valid instrument. The DMSS has scientific validity that could allow for greater precision in further research on motor subtypes.",

     "abstract": "Elevations in hepatic iron content occur with aging and physiological stressors, which may promote oxidative injury to the liver. Since dysregulation of the iron regulatory hormone, hepcidin, can cause iron accumulation, our goal was to characterize the regulation of hepcidin in young (6 mo) and old (24 mo) Fischer 344 rats exposed to environmental heat stress. Liver and blood samples were taken in the control condition and after heating. Hepcidin expression did not differ between young and old rats in the control condition, despite higher levels of hepatic iron and IL-6 mRNA in the latter. Following heat stress, pSTAT3 increased in both groups, but C/EBP\u03b1 and hepcidin mRNA increased only in old rats. Despite this, serum iron decreased in both age groups 2\u00a0h after heat stress, suggesting hepcidin-independent hypoferremia in the young rats. The differential regulation of hepcidin between young and old rats after hyperthermia may be due to the enhanced expression of C/EBP\u03b1 protein in old rats. These data support the concept of \u201cinflammaging\u201d and suggest that repeated exposures to stressors may contribute to the development of anemia in older individuals.",

This was consistent with a significant reduction in malonyldialdehyde (MDA) level and increase in antioxidant enzyme activities of the flies fed with lutein-treated diet compared with those fed with basal diet. Paraquat (PQ) and H2O2 treatment tests demonstrated that lutein could prolong the survival time of the flies. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis indicated the gene expression of superoxide dismutase (SOD; SOD1 and SOD2), and catalase (CAT) in the lutein-treated group was up-regulated relative to that of the control group.

The patients\u2019 mean age was 72.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 years. Significant diet correction was achieved after 18-month follow-up in the intervention group, comparing to controls. More patients followed strictly Mediterranean diet and consumed healthy foods more frequently. There was no significant difference between the groups in physical activity, tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption or diet after the intervention. In conclusion, an 18-month intensified GP's intervention had limited effect on lifestyle habits.

The aim of the paper is to describe a process of constructing and validating a three-dimensional screening tool for identification of abuse in older persons. It describes four studies that were conducted in the process of development and assessment of a three-dimensional screening tool for identification of abuse that consisted of direct questioning, identification of risk indicators and identification of signs of abuse. The study participants were, respectively, 108, 730 and 1317 community-dwelling individuals, aged \u226565, cognitively intact, and 71 residents of long-term care facilities. Questionnaires included the three dimensional tool for identification of abuse, Expanded Indicators of Abuse (E-IOA), list of signs of abuse, direct questioning for disclosure of abuse, and personal, medical and functioning details. Discriminant function analyses (DFA) and receiver-operating curve (ROC) analyses in each of the described steps showed good psychometric properties of the risk indicators. Regression analyses adjusted for socio-demographic and health variables showed that risk indicators significantly increased likelihood of abuse in individuals living in the community and in long-term care facilities. The three dimensions of identification of abuse were partially overlapped in their identification of different rates of abuse. In conclusion, the three-dimensional identification tool is efficient for identifying older adults experiencing abuse or at risk of abuse.",

Depressive symptoms were evaluated with observer and self-rating instruments: the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the \u201cmood\u201d subscale of the Nurses Observation Scale for geriatric patients (NOSGER). Anosognosia was evaluated with the Anosognosia Questionnaire for Dementia (AQ-D). For the evaluation of behavioral and neuropsychological symptoms in dementia and the caregiver burden, the neuropsychiatric inventory (NPI) and the Cares of older People in Europe (COPE) Index were administered. A total of 47 patients were enrolled in the study at the department's geriatric psychiatry outpatient clinic. A considerable discrepancy was found between observer- and self-ratings of depressive symptoms. In 74.5% of the participants, caregiver ratings indicated secondary symptoms of depression as opposed to patient ratings. Thus, in AD, anosognosia may affect not only deficits in cognition and everyday functioning but also affective symptoms (\u201caffective anosognosia\u201d). Caregiver rating therefore is particularly important when assessing mood changes in AD patients.",

Prevalence of cognitive impairment was 27.6% in women and 7.7% in men, and mobility disability was present in 51.7% of women and 26.5% of men. The women to men odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for cognitive impairment and mobility disability was 3.52 (1.98\u20136.28) and 3.79 (2.47\u20135.85), respectively, after adjusting for the observed life course social and health conditions. The female excess was only partially explained by gender inequalities in nutritional status, marital status and, to a lesser extent, education. Among men and women, age, childhood hunger, lack of education, absence of a partner and being underweight were independent risk factors for cognitive impairment, while age, childhood poor health, food insecurity and being overweight were risk factors for mobility disability. Enhancing nutritional status and education opportunities throughout life span could prevent cognitive impairment and mobility disability and partly reduce the female excess in these disabilities.",

Independent variables were handgrip strength and usual walking speed at baseline survey. Dependent variables were functional status in higher-level competence at 4-year follow-up. Logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI), revealed that handgrip strength was significantly correlated with decline of higher-level competence in both sexes. Usual walking speed was significantly correlated with decline in higher-level competence only in women. This study revealed that handgrip strength is a predictor for decline in higher-level competence in urban community-dwelling Japanese elderly men and women. Results suggest that handgrip strength may be used to screen for functional capacity decline in community-dwelling elderly.",

     "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia among elderly people. However its relationship with the frailty syndrome is not well understood. It has been suggested that AF may be a marker of frailty in elderly, leading to the loss of independence in performing of routine daily activities. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between AF, frailty and cognitive decline in elderly patients. A total of 140 hospitalized patients, mean age 79.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4 years were enrolled in our study. Of these, 70 were affected by parossistic, persistent or permanent AF and 70, matched for age and gender, were concurrently studied as control. Cognitive impairment and frailty state has been evaluated in each patient using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and a standard score of accumulated deficits for constructing a frailty index. We have observed a higher number of frail patients in the AF group as compared with controls (88.6% vs 67.1%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). The group of patients with frailty syndrome had MMSE score significantly lower than those of the nonfrail group (16.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8 vs 22.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Furthermore, a negative correlation between MMSE score and frailty index (rho\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.517, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) has been shown. Our study points out a statistical association between frailty and AF.

We followed 8063 elderly adults for 2 years, and we analyzed the relationship between CKD and LTCI need. The outcome studied was new certification for LTCI service need during a 2-year period. We measured serum creatinine (the estimated glomerular filtration rate; eGFR), serum albumin, frailty checklist scores, and body mass index. During the 2-year follow-up, 536 subjects (6.6%) were newly certified as needing LTCI services. We stratified the cohort according to eGFR quartile and performed multivariate analyses using an eGFR value of 71.4\u201383.6\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2 as a reference. We found that subjects with eGFR values <60.0\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2 had a significantly elevated risk of LTCI service need (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.44 [95% CI 1.12\u20131.86]).

Locomotive and visual/hearing organs disorders and physical function were assessed using a self-rated questionnaire. Competence level with activities of daily living (ADL) was used to assess physical function. Locomotive disorder was more prevalent in females than in males, and the presence of such disorders tended to have more influence on the risk of falling and decline in ADL function in females than in males. Locomotive disorders may have a greater effect on the lives of elderly females compared with elderly males. Although there was no significant odds ratio in the presence of multiple disorders, the prevalence rate of the multiple disorders increased with age and this increased the risk of falling also increases with age.",

To evaluate the construct validity, we assessed the ability of the FES-I to discriminate people based on gender, level of education, number of falls and FoF. The correlation with the Short Form of Health Survey (SF-36), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Functional Reach Test (FRT) was also determined to test validity. Internal consistency was excellent in both self-report (0.93) and interview (0.92) versions. All intra-class correlations (ICCs) were above 0.70 with the highest reliability obtained for the condition where the interview based FES-I was used in both test and retest sessions. The strength of correlation between the FES-I and TUG varied based on mode of administration: moderate for interview and high for self-report mode. The FES-I had a higher correlation with the SF-36 subscales of physical health than subscales of mental health. The FES-I had the ability to discriminate the participants based on gender, educational level, and number of falls and FoF.

It is unclear whether a decline in functional capacity results from the loss of MM and/or the qualitative impairment of the muscle tissue. The aim of our research was to investigate the relationship between physical performance and grip strength, inflammatory markers and MM in a population of community-dwelling very old persons. This study is a cross-sectional analysis within the BELFRAIL-study, a cohort study of subjects aged 80 years and older (n\u00a0=\u00a0567). MM was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) concentrations were determined on fasting blood samples. Logistic regression analysis was build using a low physical performance level evaluated according to Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) (dependent variable) and grip strength, pro-inflammatory status and MM (independent variables) adjusted for age and for the total number of chronic diseases. Low SPPB scores were associated with grip strength scores for women (OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.77\u20130.96)), and for men (OR 0.89 (95% CI 0.81\u20130.96)). The relationships between low SPPB and MM or inflammatory profile were not significant. Our results show that low physical performance remains associated with low grip strength even after considering other risk factors for sarcopenia in the oldest old and support the hypothesis that low muscle strength is a better indicator than low MM. The role of an inflammatory component in the age-related loss of muscle strength and function could not be confirmed.",

A randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the effects of exercise with or without thermal therapy in community-dwelling elderly women with chronic knee pain. Women over 75 years of age with knee pain (n\u00a0=\u00a0150) were randomly assigned into four groups; exercise (Ex) and heat/steam generating sheet (HSGS) (n\u00a0=\u00a038), Ex (n\u00a0=\u00a037), HSGS (n\u00a0=\u00a038), or health education (HE) (n\u00a0=\u00a037).

Functional fitness, visual analog scale (VAS), and Japanese knee osteoarthritis measure (JKOM) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The results showed VAS improvements in the Ex\u00a0+\u00a0HSGS and HSGS groups. Total JKOM score, muscle strength, and functional mobility significantly improved in the Ex\u00a0+\u00a0HSGS group compared with the HE group.

Participants were aged 40\u201379 years (n\u00a0=\u00a02929) at baseline and 6.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a0193) died over a median 4.3 years of follow-up. The FI was generated from 39 deficits, including self-reported health, morbidities, functional performance and psychological assessments. The FP and FS consisted of five phenotypic criteria and both categorized individuals as robust when they had 0 criteria, prefrail as 1\u20132 criteria and frail as 3+ criteria. The mean FI increased linearly with age (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.21) and in Cox regression models adjusted for age, center, smoking and partner status the hazard ratio (HR) for death for each unit increase of the FI was 1.49. Men who were prefrail or frail by either the FP or FS definitions, had a significantly increased risk of death compared to their robust counterparts. Compared to robust men, those who were FP frail at baseline had a HR for death of 3.84, while those who were FS frail had a HR of 3.87. All three frailty models significantly predicted future mortality among community-dwelling, middle-aged and older European men after adjusting for potential confounders. Our data suggest that the choice of frailty model may not be of paramount importance when predicting future risk of death, enabling flexibility in the approach used.",

Primary outcomes were admission National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and in-hospital mortality/discharge to hospice, and secondary outcomes included subsequent intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and modified Barthel index (mBI) at 3 months. Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between pre-admission statin use and outcomes among elderly patients.

A statistically significant association was found between the following variables: gender and the presence of a caregiver with gum disease; age, residence area, presence of a caregiver and household density with need for dental prosthesis; and household density with soft tissue injuries. Therefore, precarious oral health conditions were found among the elderly and associations were found between these conditions and the socio-demographic factors, particularly gender, age and residence area.

The degree of MS and MF was significantly and positively related to each other and positively associated with BMI, waist, FM and FM% as well as with IMAT. The area of PM was negatively related with MF even after adjustment for weight. Leptin was positively associated with MF and MS, whereas hs-CRP to MF. In backward regression analyses, larger waist and smaller PM area explained 90% of MF variance, whereas leptin about 80% of MS variance. IL-6 expression in SAT was significantly higher in participants with higher MQI values.

     "abstract": "SAMP8 exhibits accelerated aging and a short lifespan. Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R)/FOXO pathway is associated with aging. Phosphorylation of IGF-1R, Akt, and FOXO1 was found to be increased during aging in the liver of SAMR1 normal aging mice. However, significant decreases in the phosphorylation of IGF-1R and Akt were observed in the liver of SAMP8 during aging compared with that in SAMR1, whereas phosphorylation of FOXO1 was markedly increased with age in SAMP8. In addition, the protein level of FOXO1 was decreased with age in SAMP8. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) directly dephosphorylates FOXO1. Significant reduction of PP2A activity was observed in the liver nucleus of SAMP8. These results suggest the possibility that the increased FOXO1 phosphorylation might occur by the decreased activity of PP2A, resulting in the decrease in the protein level of FOXO1 in SAMP8. Furthermore, FOXO1 regulates longevity and the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as Mn-SOD and catalase. The expression of Mn-SOD and catalase was significantly decreased in the liver of SAMP8. Therefore, it is possible that the elevation of phosphorylated FOXO1 level with age causes a short lifespan in SAMP8.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to elucidate the body core temperature rhythms of bedridden elderly patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) in a Japanese hospital using a simple, non-invasive, deep-body thermometer. We measured body core temperature on the surface of abdomen in 10 bedridden elderly patients with DOC continuously over 72\u00a0h. A non-heated core body temperature thermometer was used. The cycle of the body core temperature rhythm was initially derived by using the least squares method. Then, based on that rhythm, the mean, amplitude, and times of day of the highest and lowest body temperatures during the optimum cycle were determined using the cosinor method. We found a 24-h cycle in seven of the 10 patients. One patient had a 6-h, one a 12-h, and one a 63-h cycle. The mean value of the cosine curve in the respective optimum cycles was 36.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0\u00b0C, and the amplitude was 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0\u00b0C. Of the seven subjects with 24-h cycles, the highest body temperature occurred between 12:58 and 14:44\u00a0h in four. In addition to 24-h cycles of core temperature rhythm, short cycles of 12 and 6-h and a long cycle of 63-h were seen. In order to understand the temperature rhythms of bedridden elderly patients with DOC, it is necessary to monitor their core body temperatures, ideally using a simple, non-invasive device. In the future, it will be important to investigate the relationship of the core temperature rhythm to nursing care and living environment.",

An assessment of published (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, AMED, Cochrane library, PEDro) and unpublished/trial registry (OpenGrey, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, Current Controlled Trials, the UK National Research Register Archive) databases were undertaken. Methodological quality of the literature was assessed using the QUADAS-2 appraisal tool. Nine studies including 690 participants, with a mean age of 82.1 years were included. The literature demonstrated a high risk of bias for study methodology, but low risk of bias for applicability. Two assessment domains were recognized: pain and delirium. For pain, the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and DOLOPLUS-2 tools possessed strong inter-rater reliability and internal consistency, with the FACS demonstrating concurrent validity with other pain scales. For delirium, the Delirium Rating Scale-Revisited-98 (DRS-R-98) demonstrated high inter-rater reliability and sensitivity and specificity, with the NEECHAM Confusion Scale possessing high internal consistency. To conclude, there is a paucity of literature assessing the reliability, validity and diagnostic test accuracy of instruments to assess people with cognitive impairment following hip fracture surgery. Based on the current available data, delirium may be best assessed using the NEECHAM Confusion Scale or DRS-R-98. Pain is most accurately evaluated using the FACS.",

Variability in the NH characteristics reported and QOL measurements precluded meta-analysis. Studies with low and medium risk of bias (ROB) suggested that nonprofit NHs resulted in better QOL for residents. The low ROB study indicated that in certain QOL domains, rural facilities and facilities with a higher percentage of private rooms were associated with better self-reported resident QOL. All low and medium ROB studies found that RN, LVN/LPN and total nursing staff had no significant relationship with QOL. One longitudinal quasi-experimental study indicated that the Green House with individualized care had better QOL than conventional NHs. The available evidence does not permit strong conclusions about the association between NH characteristics and residents\u2019 QOL. The evidence does, however, raise questions about whether NH structure alone can improve residents\u2019 QOL and how residents\u2019 QOL should be measured and improved.",

A total of 1521 elderly subjects aged 65 years or above were observed from the year 2004 to 2006; this sample was considered to be a national representative sample. The utilization of acute medical care (including outpatient services, emergency services, and inpatient services) and medical expenditure were measured. Functional disability was measured by determining limitations on activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and mobility. After adjusting for age, comorbidity, and sociodemographic characteristics, functional disability that affected IADLs or mobility was a significant factor contributing to the increased use of care. A clear proportional relationship existed between disability and utilization, and this pattern persisted across different types of acute care services. Disability affecting IADLs or mobility, rather than ADLs, was a more sensitive predictor of acute medical care utilization. Compared to elderly persons with no limitations, the medical expenditure of those with moderate-to-severe limitations was 2\u20133 times higher for outpatient, emergency, and inpatient services. In conclusion, functional disability among the elderly is a significant factor contributing to the increased use of acute care services.",

Biomechanical assessment of gait, chair rise (CR) and sit-down (CSt), stair ascent (SA) and descent (SD) was performed using an 8-camera VICON system (120\u00a0Hz) and Kistler force plates. Comparisons between groups (60s, 70s and 80s) were made using ANOVA. The FD was defined as the muscle moment generated during a task, divided by the maximum isometric strength (expressed as a percentage). FD was higher in the 80s age group compared to those in the 60s. The demand on hip and knee extensors was normally higher than those of flexors across all the activities. The knee extensor demand during gait (101%), SA (103%) and SD (120%), and hip extensor demand during gait (127%) were high requiring moments in excess of the maximum isometric muscle strength available at these joints. FD during CR and CSt was comparatively lower with knee extensor demands of 73% and 69% and hip extensor demands of 88% and 51%, respectively.

Only the BSW was a significant predictor for falling (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.736, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). The reliability and validity of the BSW protocol were acceptable overall. Prospective studies are warranted to evaluate the predictive value of the BSW for determining the risk of falling.",

     "abstract": "The physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q) has been the most popular simple method of screening for people who intend to engage in exercise programs. Despite of the recommendations indicating that the instrument should be applied in the age range from 15 to 69 years, the questionnaire has been widely used in elderly people. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of PAR-Q in elderly women with respect to absolute and relative contraindications to exercise and verify the influence of educational level and cognitive status. Eighty-nine subjects (61\u201389 years) participated in the study and went through clinical exams and exercise testing. The influence of educational status, age and cognitive state (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE) on the PAR-Q responses was analyzed by logistic regression. The occurrences of absolute and relative contraindications were respectively 9% and 22%. The Sensitivity and Specificity were 75.0% and 19.8% (absolute) and 77.8% and 19.7% (relative). The PAR-Q results were not influenced by low educational status; age, or cognitive state. In conclusion, although the usefulness and easy applicability of the PAR-Q's questions, the responses to the questionnaire led to a high number of false positive and false negative cases, suggesting that it would not be adequate as a pre-participation screening tool in elder samples.",

Five thousand four hundred and sixty-four participants aged 50\u201397 in 1996 enrolled the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA) for four waves of interview during 11 years. Social and health-related determinants were collected in each interview. Mobility limitation was enquired level of difficulty in eight movement tasks, including lifting 11\u00a0kg weight, squatting, running 20\u201330\u00a0m, standing for 15\u00a0min, walking 200\u2013300\u00a0m, climbing up two to three floors, raising arms up and grasping with fingers. According to the mixed models with repeated measurements, more frequent gardening and longer time for each exercise predicted subsequent better mobility function in Taiwanese elderly while controlling demographics and current comorbidities. The protective effect of gardening was robust in all models. Frequent alcohol consumption was harmful to future mobility function, but less as harmful when participants aged. Besides, the depression-related somatic complaints were predictive to future mobility limitation among those without limitation at baseline. It shall be worthy to explore the dosage as well as the mechanism of these protective factors, especially the most significant but the least explored factor, gardening. Additionally, efforts should be made to understand the relationship between depression-related somatic complaints and mobility decline and so as the relevant interventions.",

The elderly women spent 18.3% of their daytime walking, 7.31% in a standing position, 56.9% sitting and 17.4% lying down. Our results showed that the time spent in walking or standing positions was significantly associated with balance and physical performance such as walking speed, while the time spent in a sitting position was inversely associated with muscle strength, balance and physical performance.

Forty-seven healthy older adults (women\u00a0=\u00a024, men\u00a0=\u00a023; mean age 68.2 years) participated in a exercise intervention (60\u00a0min/session) that included resistance exercise training (2 days/week) at 75\u201380% of maximum plus a multicomponent weight-bearing impact exercise training (1 day/week). Outcome measures included lumbar spine and proximal femoral BMD, dynamic balance, muscle strength, serum levels of bone metabolism markers [osteocalcin (OC), C-terminal telopeptide of Type I collagen (CTX), osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)] and serum levels of inflammatory markers [high sensitive (hs)-C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3]. Potential confounding variables included body composition, dietary intake (using 4-day diet records), and accelerometer-based physical activity. After 32 weeks, both men and women increased dynamic balance (6.4%), muscle strength (11.0%) and trochanter (0.7%), intertrochanter (0.7%), total hip (0.6%), and lumbar spine BMD (1.7%), while OC, CTX, OPG and RANKL levels remained unchanged. In addition, hs-CRP and IFN-\u03b3 levels were decreased, while TNF-\u03b1 levels were unchanged, and a decrease in IL-6 levels was only observed in men. These findings suggest that our combined impact protocol reduces inflammation and increases BMD, balance, and lower-extremity muscle strength, despite having little effect on bone metabolism markers. This reinforces the role of exercise to counteract the age-related inflammation, and the muscle strength, balance and BMD reduction.",

Our study aims to evaluate the effects of daily consumption of EVOO in the healthy institutionalized elderly. We studied anthropometric, biochemical and antioxidant parameters in 62 subjects aged 65\u201396 years after a 6-week daily intake of polyphenol-rich EVOO with high oleuropein derivative contents. Subjects were divided into a control group (CG) who maintained their dietary habits (n\u00a0=\u00a039) and an olive group (OG) who consumed EVOO as the only added fat, plus a daily dose of 50\u00a0ml (n\u00a0=\u00a023). We found a significant reduction of total cholesterol (TC), HDL, LDL and TGs in OG subjects and a significant increase of HDL levels. There was no significant variation in the CG parameters. In OG the total antioxidant capacity (TAC) in plasma increased with significant differences over CG. Plasma hydroxytyrosol (OH-Tyr) concentration showed a significant increase after EVOO intervention. Daily consumption of EVOO was found to have positive effects on lipid profiles, OH-Tyr levels and TAC. The results also show a significant increase of catalase (CAT) in erythrocytes and a decrease (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GH-PX) activity after EVOO intake. To our knowledge, no other study has examined the effects of EVOO consumption on biochemical parameters, antioxidant capacity and antioxidant enzyme activity in healthy elderly subjects. In conclusion, our results show that nutritional intervention with EVOO improves antioxidant status in healthy elderly people.",

Sixty community-dwelling senior volunteers were randomized to either an online game suite designed to train multiple cognitive abilities, or to a control arm with online activities that simulated the look and feel of the games but with low level interactivity and no calibration of difficulty. Study assessment included measures of recruitment, retention and play-time. Cognitive change was measured with a computerized assessment battery administered just before and within two weeks after completion of the six-week intervention. Impediments to feasibility included: limited access to in-home high-speed internet, large variations in the amount of time devoted to game play, and a reluctance to pursue more challenging levels. Overall analysis was negative for assessed performance (transference effects) even though subjects improved on the games themselves. Post hoc analyses suggest that some types of games may have more value than others, but these effects would need to be replicated in a study designed for that purpose. We conclude that a six-week, moderate-intensity computer game-based cognitive intervention can be implemented with high-functioning seniors, but the effect size is relatively small. Our findings are consistent with Owen et al. (2010), but there are open questions about whether more structured, longer duration or more intensive \u2018games for learning\u2019 interventions might yield more substantial cognitive improvement in seniors.",

Studies published in English language were identified through MEDLINE (1990 through April 2010), Cochrane databases, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website and manual searches of reference lists from relevant publications. The study had to include general (non-disease specific) populations of adults aged 65 years or older. Using a standardized protocol, two investigators independently abstracted information on participant characteristics and adjusted measures of the association. Studies that controlled for the presence of specific diseases were further identified and analyzed. When the syndrome examined was similar from different studies, we computed the pooled risk estimates using a random-effects model. We assessed the strength of evidence following the recommended guidelines. We identified 47 eligible articles from 6 countries. Multiple morbidity, frailty, and disabilities were associated with hospitalization and nursing home admission (moderate evidence). Cognitive impairment was associated with hospitalization (low evidence) and nursing home admission (moderate evidence). Among these studies, 20 articles controlled for specific diseases. Limited evidence suggested that these geriatric syndromes are associated with hospitalization and institutionalization after controlling for the presence of specific diseases. We conclude that geriatric syndromes are associated with risk of hospitalization or nursing home admission. Efforts to prevent hospitalization or nursing home admission should target strategies to prevent and manage these syndromes.",

The most important psychosexual needs included: conversation, tenderness, emotional closeness (empathy, understanding), sexual contacts and physical closeness. As the most important elements of the relationship, respondents mentioned mutual respect and conviction that they can rely on their partners. Most respondents felt sexual tension occasionally, others once a week or less frequently. They relieved sexual tension through intimate contacts with their long-term partners, watching erotic films, masturbation, walking and diverting attention to other activities. Every fourth respondent was satisfied with his/her sexual life. The majority of seniors repeated stereotypes about sexuality of the elderly. Almost 71% claimed that sex in elderly people was taboo, 64% said that sex was for young people only, and 51% thought that sex was not important in life. Old age makes little difference to psychosexual needs. Most seniors need closeness manifesting as tenderness and conversations. Many old people are sexually active.

The observed lower baseline content of PVEB may indicate oxidative stress contributing to the sequlae of sepsis, but did not correlate with the outcome or the severity of illness. Serial measurements are needed to validate PVEB as a marker in sepsis.",

     "abstract": "Research indicates that very short or long durations of sleep and inefficient sleep are associated with higher total cholesterol and risk of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. This study tested the hypothesis that inefficient sleep or short/long sleep durations are associated with an elevated prevalence of type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension in a community-dwelling sample of elderly Alzheimer's caregivers. Participants were 126 caregivers for spouses with Alzheimer's disease who underwent in-home sleep assessment by wrist actigraphy for 72 consecutive hours. Sleep data were averaged across the 3 days/nights; nighttime sleep and daytime napping were computed. Morning fasting blood samples were collected to determine measures of blood lipids and glucose. The average of three resting blood pressure measurements was used to estimate mean resting blood pressure. Logistic regression models including covariates related to sleep and metabolic regulation indicated that nighttime sleep duration, percent sleep at night, and daytime naps were not significantly associated with odds of having diabetes (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.56\u20131.53; OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.83\u20131.03; OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 0.74\u20134.11, respectively), dyslipidemia (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.57\u20131.20; OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.92\u20131.07; OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.33\u20131.24, respectively), or hypertension (OR, 0.97; 95%CI, 0.62\u20131.52; OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.93\u20131.11; OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.44\u20132.74, respectively). When categorical and combined sleep parameters were examined, there were no significant associations with any of the metabolic conditions (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The current study suggests that in an elderly sample of Alzheimer's caregivers, nighttime sleep duration, nighttime sleep efficiency and daytime naps are not significantly associated with prevalent type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, or hypertension. As several of the associations demonstrated clinically relevant magnitudes of the associations, larger studies to more fully test these hypotheses are warranted.",

     "abstract": "AAD is a relatively uncommon yet catastrophic disease. Though the relationship between AAD and age has been discussed in several previous studies, many facets of the relationship between AAD and the elderly still remain unclear. From a retrospective review of charts from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2010, we collected data of 132 spontaneous AAD cases in a medical center in Taiwan, 83 of which were enrolled in our study. We divided patients into two groups: one above 65 years old (elderly), and a second, non-elderly group. Data collected for statistical analysis included: clinical manifestations on arrival, time of onset, type of AAD, width of mediastinum, whether or not the patient underwent an operation, number of days spent hospitalized, and in-hospital mortality rates. We found that in the elderly group there were more instances of hyperglycemia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), more neurologic defects (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), less chest pain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and less abdominal pain (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). SBP was also lower in the elderly group (139\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00a0mmHg, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), while there was no difference in mediastinal width between these two groups. In both groups, most AAD cases were DeBakey type III, but type I AAD was more commonly seen in the elderly (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0011). We found that there were both lower SBP and higher rate of diabetes in the elderly group. The elderly group also had longer hospital stays (14.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.3 days, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and almost twice the mortality rate (31.1% vs. 15.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).",

The latest data suggests that inflammation plays a critical role in bone remodeling and in pathogenesis of osteoporosis. NLR is a simple, non-invasive and cost-effective marker of inflammation in various malignancies and inflammatory diseases. The objective of the present study was to compare NLR levels in osteopenic, osteoporotic and control subjects and to assess the correlation between NLR levels and BMD. A total of 1635 patients aged 65 years or more were included in this cross-sectional study. BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) at the lumbar spine and femur. Complete blood count (CBC), biomarkers of inflammation (C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)), glucose/lipid metabolism and established risk factors were determined. In osteoporosis group, NLR levels were found to be elevated as compared to osteopenic and control group (2.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.45, 2.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.00 and 2.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85, respectively).

This study examined the age differences between the controlled force exertion measured by a sinusoidal waveform and a bar chart display. The participants comprised 175 right-handed male adults aged 20\u201386 years. The participants were divided into three age groups: young (n\u00a0=\u00a053), middle-aged (n\u00a0=\u00a071), and elderly (n\u00a0=\u00a051). They matched the submaximal grip strength exerted by their dominant hand to changing demand values displayed as either a sinusoidal waveform or a bar chart appearing on a personal computer screen. The participants performed the controlled force exertion test three times with a 1-min inter-trial interval using their dominant hand. The dependent variable was the total sum of the percentage values of the differences between the demand value and grip exertion value for more than 25\u00a0s. The coefficient of variance had almost the same range in all age groups in both displays (CVSW\u00a0=\u00a028.0\u201336.9, CVBC\u00a0=\u00a029.1\u201332.6), but the elderly group showed a somewhat higher value with the sinusoidal waveform.

Scores over 1500% in sinusoidal and bar chart display were found in one and two participants, respectively, in the middle-aged group and in 12% and 16% of the participants, respectively, in the elderly group. Furthermore, among all participants, only 8% of participants in the elderly group scored over 1500% in both displays. Scores over 1500% in both displays are considered to be considerably worse in controlled force exertion than lower scores.",

This study evaluated the relative and absolute reliability and concurrent validity of the testing procedure of the clinical version of the Narrow Path Walking Test (NPWT) under single task (ST) and dual task (DT) conditions. Thirty independent community-dwelling older adults (65\u201387 years) were tested twice. Participants were instructed to walk within the 6-m narrow path without stepping out. Trial time, number of steps, trial velocity, number of step errors, and number of cognitive task errors were determined. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated as indices of agreement, and a graphic approach called \u201cmountain plot\u201d was applied to help interpret the direction and magnitude of disagreements between testing procedures. Smallest detectable change and smallest real difference (SRD) were computed to determine clinically relevant improvement at group and individual levels, respectively. Concurrent validity was assessed using Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment Tool (POMA) and the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Test\u2013retest agreement (ICC1,2) varied from 0.77 to 0.92 in ST and from 0.78 to 0.92 in DT conditions, with no apparent systematic differences between testing procedures demonstrated by the mountain plot graphs. Smallest detectable change and smallest real change were small for motor task performance and larger for cognitive errors. Significant correlations were observed for trial velocity and trial time with POMA and SPPB. The present results indicate that the NPWT testing procedure is highly reliable and reproducible.",

The sample consisted of 118 volunteer subjects who were healthy and ranging in age from 26 to 91. The examinations included a clinical investigation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain neuroimaging, and a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. The effect of age on fluid IQ with and without visual spatial praxis and on crystallized IQ was tested whether being fully-, partially- or non-mediated by physical health. Structural equation analyses showed that the best and most parsimonious fit to the data was provided by models that were fully mediated for fluid IQ without praxis, non-mediated for crystallized IQ and partially mediated for fluid IQ with praxis. The diseases of the circulatory and nervous systems were the major mediators. It was concluded from the pattern of findings that the effect of age on fluid intelligence is fully mediated by physical health, while crystallized intelligence is non-mediated and visual spatial praxis is partially mediated, influenced mainly by direct effects of age. Our findings imply that improving health by acting against the common age-related circulatory- and nervous system diseases and risk factors will oppose the decline in fluid intelligence with age.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between depressive symptoms and hippocampal/amygdalar volume, a reliable biomarker in the prediction of progression to dementia in SMI. Ninety subjects with SMI participated in the study, and 28 healthy participants without memory complaints served as a normal control (NC) group. 3-D T1-weighted structural MRI scans were completed in all subjects. When the volumes of hippocampus and amygdala were compared among the groups, the SMI group showed significantly smaller volumes than the NC group. When multiple regression analysis was conducted in all subjects, neither hippocampal nor amygdalar volume showed significant interaction effect between group and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). However, when the analysis was conducted within each group, lower GDS score was associated with smaller hippocampal volume in the SMI group, and higher GDS score was associated with smaller amygdalar volume in the NC group. Thus, individuals with SMI and less depressive symptoms tend to have smaller hippocampus, which could be associated with more risk of dementia, than normal individuals.",

Using MEDLINE, we searched for prospective studies investigating risk factors for falls in nursing home residents (NHR) and older hospital inpatients (HI). When there were at least 3 studies investigating a factor in a comparable way in a specific setting, we computed the pooled odds ratio (OR) using random effect models. Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Eighteen risk factors for NHR and six for HI were considered, including socio-demographic, mobility, sensory, medical factors, and medication use. For NHR, the strongest associations were with history of falls (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.06), walking aid use (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.08) and moderate disability (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.08).

No association emerged with age in NHR (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.00), while the OR for a 5\u00a0years increase in age of HI was 1.04. Female sex was, if anything, associated with a decreased risk. A few other medical conditions and medications were also associated with a moderately increased risk. For some important factors (e.g. balance and muscle weakness), a summary estimate was not computed because the measures used in various studies were not comparable. Falls in older people in nursing homes and hospitals have multifactorial etiology. History of falls, use of walking aids and disability are strong predictors of future falls.",

We sent a questionnaire to 300 unit-care model nursing homes and 900 conventional model nursing homes. 81 unit-care model facilities, 164 conventional care model facilities, and 103 conventional care facilities which created small groupings of people within larger buildings as an alternative to multiple small separate units (group-care model) were included in the analysis. We asked the administrator of the facilities about their principles for care provision by the dimensions of (1) wake-up, (2) dressing assistance in the morning, (3) meal, (4) bathing, (5) toileting assistance, and (6) spare time. We mainly asked about flexibility of scheduling and choice for menu, programs, and utensils. Unit-care model facilities and group-care model facilities were negatively associated with principles of fixed time and all-at-once assistance for waking up, dressing, and toileting. Residents had more choice for menu and programs for spare time in unit-care model facilities and group-care model facilities. The governmental requirements affected principles for care provision by defining the structure of facilities and staffing for desirable care provision. Raising fees for the group-care model can be an effective measure to achieve it in facilities with conventional structure.",

Family members remain involved in the caring process after their relatives have been admitted to an institution. On average, accommodation costs in nursing homes in Slovenia have risen above the residents\u2019 retirement pension, and families must supplement the difference. Because of this, familial involvement should be linked to reduced accommodation costs. This research employed a non-experimental, descriptive study design through unstructured interviews. Participants included fifty family members (n\u00a0=\u00a050) who visit their relatives in nursing homes. Data were collected in 2010 at five nursing homes in Slovenia and processed by means of conventional content analysis. The major themes that emerged from the content analysis, describing family involvement, were as follows: visiting and making oneself useful, delivery of items for personal use, hands-on care, physical therapy and organization of nursing home activities. Family members showed some interest in receiving financial compensation for their involvement. The proposed financial compensation may be a delicate and morally questionable matter but would involve fairness and transparency, while enabling easier organization of elder care provision.

We assessed whether a diagnosis of probable AD in elderly patients admitted to traditional long-term care facilities results in different mortality rates. We analyzed data belonging to a prospective, multi-center (n\u00a0=\u00a04) cohort study involving 378 long-term care facility residents. In our population the prevalence of dementia (any-type) and AD were 46.3% and 11.9%, respectively. During a median follow-up of 5.7 years [25\u201375th percentile, 2.6\u20136.9], 262 (69.3%) elderly died. Compared to other admission diagnoses, AD was characterized by lower mortality rates: all-cause hazard risk (HR), 0.64 [95% CI, 0.41\u20130.99] (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048); HR for cardiovascular (CV) causes, 0.40 [95% CI, 0.20\u20130.78] (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008).

The MT group received eight training sessions to learn mnemonic strategies based on ecological tasks. They also completed tasks which recruited attention and executive functions. Educational content on memory and aging was also offered. The EI participated in the same number of sessions, yet, only the educational content was offered. The CG completed pre- and post-test evaluations, and received training afterwards.Training effects were modest and for certain variables they were equivalent to retest effects. However, after training, individuals with MCI in the MT group exhibited cognitive performance typical of individuals without cognitive impairment, suggesting cognitive plasticity.MT is a feasible non-pharmacological intervention which might bring positive performance change in older adults facing cognitive impairment.",

     "abstract": "This population-based cross-sectional study describes social participation expressed as the accomplishment of social, cultural, and leisure activities resulting from informal support given by relatives or friends, formal support given by the municipality or county, or a combination of the two, among 452 individuals aged 60\u201393 years suffering from osteoporosis-related fractures. A fourth group of individuals with fractures without any support was used as a reference group. Fractures included were humeral, wrist, vertebral, hip, pelvic and ankle fractures. Questionnaires were used to collect sociodemographic data and information on social participation, social support, and covariates. The results showed that a smaller proportion of those with only formal support took part in social, cultural, or leisure activities, compared to participants with informal support alone, both informal and formal support or those without any kind of support. The associations between categories of activity and kind of support were further tested in a logistic regression model adjusting for possible confounders. Odds ratios (ORs) for taking part in social, cultural, and leisure activities were significantly lower for participants with formal support and a combination of informal and formal support, while participants receiving informal support did not show a significantly reduced OR for taking part in any category of activity, compared to the reference group. In conclusion; informal support of older people with fractures is an important means of facilitating social participation and an active lifestyle. Attention should be paid to the vulnerable situation of those who rely solely on formal support.",

BMD was measured by Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry [DXA] of the lumbar and femur, and serum osteocalcin was measured using electrochemiluminescence. A functional autonomy assessment protocol (GDLAM, 2004) was also applied. Statistical analyses used were repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc tests. The results showed a significant improvement in tests following the GDLAM protocol: 10 meters walk (10\u00a0mw) \u2013 p\u00a0=\u00a00.003; rising from a ventral decubitus position (RVDP) \u2013 \u0394%\u00a0=\u00a00.78, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; rising from a chair and moving around the house (RCMH) \u2013 p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and autonomy index (AI) \u2013 p\u00a0=\u00a00.007, with more favorable results observed in the AAG when compared to the CG.

Three thousand five hundred ninety-eight men in nationally representative cross-sectional, population-representative sampled survey using data from the KNHANES IV aged 19 years and older who completed a body composition using a dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were measured. To determine whether there are any associations between physical activities, nutritional status and sarcopenia were examined in 1156 men among those over 60 years of age. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) was calculated as the sum of skeletal muscle in the arms and legs. Sarcopenia was defined as the ASM/Ht2 of less than two standard deviations (SD) below the sex-specific normal mean for the younger reference group. The prevalence of sarcopenia in Korean men aged 60 years and older was 9.9%. Sarcopenia was negatively associated with the third quartile (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.40, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.20\u20130.80) and fourth quartile of PA (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.24, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.11\u20130.52), and negatively associated with the highest quartile of protein intake (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.32, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.14\u20130.76).

The test, which we have named the Seated Side Tapping test (Side Tapping test), requires the subjects to move their bodies laterally to the left and right in turn as quickly as possible whilst remaining in a seated position. We examined the associations between the results of the new test and those of other mobility tests, ADL, and the use of walking aids. The participants were 75 frail elderly people who were receiving rehabilitation services. Gait speed and the timed up and go (TUG) test were employed as mobility tests, and the participants\u2019 use of walking aids was recorded. The ADL score was assessed using the Barthel Index. Significant correlations were found between the side tapping test and gait speed (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.59, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and TUG (r\u00a0=\u00a00.63, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). This test also revealed significant relationships with the ADL scores and the use of walking aids. These results indicate that an ability to perform quick lateral trunk movements in a seated position reflects their mobility during standing. Thus, we concluded that since the side tapping test is simple and safe, it is useful for detecting mobility impairments, ADL levels, and the need for walking aids, especially in frail elderly individuals.",

As the ability to represent action declines, the elderly may experience increasing difficulty with movement planning and execution. Here, we determined the association between estimation of reach via use of motor imagery and actual FR. Young adults (M\u00a0=\u00a022 years) and older adults (M\u00a0=\u00a066 years) estimated reach while standing with targets randomly presented in peripersonal (within actual reach) and extrapersonal (beyond reach) space. Imagined responses were compared to the individual's scaled maximum reach. FR, also while standing, was assessed using the standardized Functional Reach Test (FRT). Results for total score estimation accuracy showed that there was no difference for age; however, results for mean bias and distribution of error revealed that the older group underestimated while the younger group overestimated. In reference to FR, younger adults outperformed older adults (30 versus 14\u00a0in.) and most prominent, only the younger group showed a significant relationship between estimation and FR. In addition to gaining insight to the effects of advanced age on the ability to mentally represent action and its association with movement execution, these results although preliminary, may have clinical implications based on the question of whether motor imagery training could improve movement estimations and how that might affect actual reach.",

A cross-sectional study was performed with 1806 women (aged 60.0\u201392.7 years) who were randomly selected from eighteen care centers. The short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to determine the weekly time spent in physical activities, and this variable was categorized into three categories (0\u00a0<\u00a0150\u00a0min/wk; 1: 150\u2013299.9\u00a0min/wk; 2: \u2265300\u00a0min/wk). Age, race/ethnicity, economic class, education level, occupational and marital status, body mass index and blood pressure status, medical conditions, use of medications, and self-rated health status were the potential correlates. The ordinal logistic regression was used as a measure of association. From the total group of participants, 49.9% followed the current recommendations related to basic health benefits (150\u2013299\u00a0min/wk), and 35.9% met the guidelines for additional health effects (300 or more min/wk). Women with secondary complete education (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17\u20131.74), positive self-rated health (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.25, 95% CI: 2.10\u201313.09), and high blood pressure (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95% CI: 1.09\u20131.62) were more likely to meet the current PAfH guidelines than their peers with primary incomplete education, negative self-rated health, and normal blood pressure. Increasing age was inversely associated with meeting the PAfH guidelines (odds ranging: 0.77\u20130.48).

We assessed whether three physical performance-based measurements could predict ADL disability 9 years later. The participants were 113 non-disabled community-dwelling women with a mean age of 79.5 years at baseline. The baseline examinations of physical performance were: functional reach, climbing steps and comfortable walking speed. ADL disability was defined as need of personal assistance in at least one of five basic ADL items. The participants were followed for 9 years. Logistic regression models were fitted for each of the physical performance measurements together with the covariates in relation to ADL disability. At follow-up 25.7% were disabled in ADL. All three performance measurements were significantly associated with the onset of ADL disability at 9 years of follow-up, however, only walking speed remained significantly related to onset of ADL disability, when all three performance measurements were included in the same model. In conclusion all the three performance measurements were related to onset of ADL disability, with walking speed having the strongest predictive value. Systematic screening based on walking speed measurements of non-disabled older women might help health professionals to identify those at risk of ADL disability and introduce preventive measures in time.",

We studied 141 consecutive elderly patients (age: 78.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5 years old, male: 41.1%) who were referred to our geriatric department for surgical risk evaluation. CGA was performed to evaluate physical health, functional status, psychological health, and social support. The primary composite outcome of this study was in-hospital death or post-discharge institutionalization. In-hospital adverse events, such as delirium, pressure ulcers, pneumonia, and urinary tract infections, were also evaluated. The associations between CGA and in-hospital adverse events, in-hospital death, and post-discharge institutionalization were investigated. There were 32 adverse outcomes (6 in-hospital deaths and 26 post-discharge institutionalizations). Compared with the patients who were discharged to their homes, patients with adverse outcomes were characterized by poor nutritional status and prior strokes. However, there was no significant difference in surgical risk or anesthesia type. The CGA results showed that patients with adverse outcomes were associated with functional dependency and poor nutrition. The cumulative number of impairments in the CGA domain was significantly associated with adverse outcomes, in-hospital events, and prolonged hospital stays. In multiple logistic regression analysis, cumulative impairment in CGA was independently associated with surgical outcomes in elderly patients undergoing elective surgery. Preoperative CGA can identify elderly patients at greater risk for mortality, post-discharge institutionalization, adverse in-hospital events, and prolonged length of hospital stay.",

Two hundred and fifty community-dwelling subjects completed several instruments assessing the above constructs. Results from structural equation modeling indicated that optimism was positively associated with both meaning in life and subjective well-being. Furthermore, the relationship between optimism and wellbeing was partially mediated by meaning in life. Although numerous studies have found that optimism is a significant predictor of well-being, the current results indicate that it might not be a key predictor in elders. Our findings suggest that a focus on meaning in life may be a productive avenue to enhance subjective well-being in later life although stable internal resources such as optimism and pessimism impact their subjective well-being.",

At baseline (T1) and (T2), the 13-item version of the SOC scale assessed coping, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) Scale assessed symptoms of depression and anxiety. The cognitive state was assessed by means of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Physical health was measured with the Charlson Index and functional status with Lawton and Brody's scales for physical self-maintenance (PSMS) and the instrumental activities of daily living (I-ADL). In all, 97 (51 men) persons with a mean age of 75.3 (SD 6.3) years and Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) score of 28.0 (SD 1.6) participated. The SOC improved significantly from baseline to 1-year later (mean 76.5, SD 11.4 vs. mean 79.1, SD 9.1, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01). Improved SOC was associated with a low SOC at baseline and living without assistance during the study period. The prevalence of depression (HAD-D\u00a0\u2265\u00a08) and the mean depression (HAD-D) score did not change between the first and second data collection (HAD-D\u00a0\u2265\u00a08: 3.1% vs. 4.1% and HAD-D score: mean 1.8, SD 2.3 vs. mean 2.4, SD 2.4). However, an improved SOC and reduced anxiety symptoms at the second time point were associated with reduced HAD-D. The mean SOC improved 1-year after hospitalization. The symptoms of depression did not change, but reduction of symptoms of depression at the second time point was associated with improved SOC.",

Of the 15,146 individuals who had taken part in the 2008 study, secondary analysis was conducted with data from 3360 persons who had spouses and were willing to respond to sex-related questions in a face-to-face interview. The mean age of male and female subjects was 67.34 and 66.86 years respectively. In the male subjects, sexual frequency, followed by marital satisfaction and cognitive function, had the greatest effect on sexual satisfaction. These three variables together accounted for 21% of the male subjects\u2019 sexual satisfaction. In the female subjects, marital satisfaction, followed by frequency of sexual activity, absence of depressive symptoms, age, and length of cohabitation with spouse, had the greatest effect on sexual satisfaction. These five variables together explained 11% of their sexual satisfaction. This study indicates that sexual frequency and physical factors have the most important effects on the sex lives of older men, while older women value psychosocial and relational factors more highly. Therefore, interventions aiming to improve sexual satisfaction in older adults should take gender differences into account.",

     "abstract": "We review sex differences in the relationship between habitual physical activity and health in the elderly, with particular reference to pedometer/accelerometer data from the Nakanojo Study. Maximal aerobic power, walking speed and habitual physical activity are 10\u201330% greater in men than in women. This reflects not only biological but also socio-cultural and environmental factors, with the latter becoming dominant as age advances. It implies a need for sex-specific thresholds of moderate activity. Overall health is associated with both the year-averaged daily step count (the best indicator in women) and the year-averaged daily duration of physical activity >3\u00a0metabolic equivalents (METs) (the best indicator in men). In both sexes, the threshold ranges of step count and/or duration of activity >3\u00a0METs associated with a reduced prevalence of health problems are: 4000\u20135000\u00a0steps/day and/or 5\u20137.5\u00a0min/day for impaired mental and psychosocial health, such as a depressed mood state and a poor health-related quality of life; 7000\u20138000\u00a0steps/day and/or 15\u201320\u00a0min/day for markers of aortic arteriosclerosis, osteoporosis, sarcopenia and poor physical fitness; and 8000\u201310,000\u00a0steps/day and/or 20\u201330\u00a0min/day for components of the metabolic syndrome, especially hypertension and hyperglycemia. Irrespective of sex, both the intensity and the total volume of physical activity are influenced by stressful life events, such as a partner's death, and immediate meteorological factors, particularly precipitation and mean ambient temperature, underlining the need for long-term measurement of activity patterns. These findings have practical implications for those who engage in epidemiological studies and/or design health promotional programs for the elderly.",

In the spectrum of events related to frailty, aging of the cardiocirculatory system and abnormalities in arterial blood pressure (BP) partly explain the changes in tissue perfusion and, potentially, the decrease in physiological reserves. This study investigated the relationship between BP levels, systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) and the frailty phenotype by analyzing frailty criteria in a cross-sectional model into the FIBRA network, a populational sample of community-dwelling elders in Southeastern Brazil. Study participants with \u226565 years were selected by probabilistic sampling of residents in the urban area of the municipality of Campinas (n\u00a0=\u00a0900). Considering frailty as a whole and the difference between genders, there was a greater proportion of frail or pre-frail individuals among women than men. Analysis of individual frailty criteria showed that weight loss and fatigue were more common among women (18.3% vs. 12.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.034 and 22.5% vs. 11.9%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively).

A cross sectional study was performed with 637 riverine elderly residents (\u226560 years old) in Mau\u00e9s city Amazonas, Brazil. The elderly were grouped in two categories with and without a history of falls in the past six months. The following variables were compared between these groups: self-reported social and health conditions; biochemical and physiological variables related to the control of metabolic diseases; body composition; hand grip strength; functional fitness evaluation using the Senior Fitness Test (SFT) battery, and balance condition using the Berg Balance Test (BBT). The prevalence of at least one fall in the past six months was 24.6% (n\u00a0=\u00a0157) and was similar between the sexes.

A history of falls was associated with hospitalization in the last year and to self-health perception to both sexes and presence of chronic morbidity and percentage of body fat (BF) to women. However, the other variables including balance and functional fitness, did not present differences between elderly with and without a history of falls. These results suggest that falls experienced by the riparian elderly are strongly associated to accidents due to environmental conditions related to daily life.",

Face-to-face interviews were conducted at the respondents\u2019 homes by trained interviewers accompanied by local health workers. The Andersen Behavioral Model helped us to evaluate the potential determinants for emergency medical utilization that included predisposing factors, enabling factors, and need factors. The measurements of determinants were repeated five times in the period of this study, and the longitudinal data were analyzed through the generalized estimating equation (GEE) by SPSS 17.0 software. The eligibility criteria were that respondents had to be more than 65 years old at baseline in 1993, and then they had to be enrolled in a 14-year follow-up period from 1993 to 2007. At the beginning of this study in 1993, there were 2961 eligible respondents in total, and in 2007, there were 1136 survivors. The loss in follow-up was mainly due to death. The results demonstrated that the significant determinants of emergency medical utilization by the elderly population were gender, age, education, self-ranked health status, chronic disease, and medical accessibility. The GEE model provides a suitable method to predict the long-term trend of emergency medical utilization by the elderly.",

The objective of this study is to examine the trend and the factors influencing the use of informal and formal caregiving among disabled elders in the community of Taiwan. Data were drawn from three waves of the Taiwan Longitudinal Study on Aging (TLSA) (1999, 2003, and 2007) to examine the receipt of help with activities of daily living (ADLs) in a nationally representative sample of Taiwanese elderly people aged 65 and older. Results showed the trend in having at least 1 of 6 ADL limitations in the community increased mildly in the past decade but a significant rise in the use of paid help compared to informal help between 1999 and 2007. Factors associated with higher likelihood of paid help use included better socio-economic status and more ADLs. However, those living with spouse only were much less likely to use paid help than those living with adult children. Findings suggest that future long-term care (LTC) policy in Taiwan should focus more on providing elders who live alone or with spouse only additional caregiving resource. Given the rapid growth of foreign care workers as primary source of caregiving, the government needs further monitoring to promote care quality and also strategies to develop needs-led home and community based care.",

Twenty-seven participants between the ages of 55 and 92 years were divided into two groups, <75 and >76 years. The task required participants to estimate reach via use of motor imagery in regard to seven targets randomly presented in peripersonal and extrapersonal space. Each condition consisted of a block of 21 trials for the ARM and TOOL and a \u201cswitch-block\u201d of 7 trials with the opposite condition. The procedure was repeated for both tool lengths and presented in counterbalanced order. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) results revealed a significant difference in the switch-blocks, suggesting that participants were more accurate when they switched from ARM to TOOL (extension) in comparison to TOOL to ARM (retraction). In addition, a correlation analysis indicated a negative relationship for accuracy in the 40\u00a0cm tool condition and age. In view of the total sample, two findings warrant further consideration. For both tool lengths, retraction from TOOL to ARM was more difficult than extension from ARM to TOOL. And specifically to the 40\u00a0cm tool, accuracy decreased as age increased. In addition to gaining information about aging of the neuro-cognitive processes associated with spatial representation, these outcomes may have implications for physical safety and rehabilitation with older persons.",

Level of NT-proBNP increased from baseline median 210.0\u00a0pg/mL (25th\u201375th percentile, 98.0\u00a0pg/mL\u2013540.0\u00a0pg/mL) to 900.9\u00a0pg/mL (25th\u201375th percentile, 704.5\u00a0pg/mL\u20131583.5\u00a0pg/mL) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032) at the end of follow-up. Among 44.26% of the cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a027) NT-proBNP level \u2265450\u00a0pg/mL was detected, which 6 deaths happened (22.22% death rate) and CVEs occurred to 62.96% of patients, comparing to 0% death rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.077) and 8.82% affected by CVEs (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) in other 55.74% of cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a034) whose NT-proBNP <450\u00a0pg/mL. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that NT-proBNP level \u2265450\u00a0pg/mL was a risk factor related to CVEs (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.96, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Cox regression analysis found NT-proBNP level \u2265450\u00a0pg/mL was an independent risk factor of CVEs (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.12, p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) after adjustment of body mass index, blood pressure, kidney function. The negative predictive value was 90.9% of NT-proBNP levels \u2265450\u00a0pg/mL for new CVEs. NT-proBNP levels diverge throughout ARVD natural progression in elderly males over 75 years of age. Elevated NT-proBNP level of \u2265450\u00a0pg/mL was predictive for CVEs with 90.9% of negative predictive value.",

Since clear gender differences have been reported in the incidence and prevalence of dementia, as well as in its consequences, gender could be hypothesized as one of the factors influencing worry and concern about developing AD. The aim of the present study was to assess gender differences in public's beliefs about AD, and to examine whether men and women differ in their worries and concerns about developing the disease, as well as in their knowledge about it. A phone survey was conducted with a representative sample of 632 lay persons (mean age\u00a0=\u00a045) in Israel. Information regarding males\u2019 and females\u2019 perceptions about their susceptibility, worry, fear and knowledge about AD was assessed. Males and females showed no statistically significant differences in their awareness of AD. Female participants consistently reported higher levels of perceived susceptibility, worry, fear, and knowledge about AD than male participants. Our findings highlight the need to improve the knowledge and awareness of the general public about AD, and particularly among men.",

Those who were screened positive for cognitive impairment carried out a battery of specific test aimed to assess their functional independence (Katz Index (KI)), memory function (Fuld Object Memory Evaluation (FOME)), depressive symptoms (Cornell Scale) and neuropsychiatric disturbances (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)). Applying multiple linear regression, TUG was associated with age (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.161, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), MMSE (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.013, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and KI (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.621, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Catecholamines and their metabolites in the cerebral cortex were measured by HPLC-ECD. The protein levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) as well as TH phosphorylated at Ser19 or Ser40, dopamine-\u03b2-hydroxylase (D\u03b2H), and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) were determined by western blot analysis. Dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) levels in SAMP10 were significantly lower than those in control animals. However, no significant difference was observed in catecholamine metabolite levels between SAMP10 and control mice. The level of TH phosphorylation at Ser40 in SAMP10 was significantly lower than that in control mice, but no significant difference was observed in the levels of TH, TH phosphorylated at Ser19, or D\u03b2H. The amount of PKA, which regulates the phosphorylation of TH at Ser40, was significantly lower in SAMP10 than in control mice. The present study demonstrated that a decline in DA and NE concentrations was observed in the cerebral cortex of SAMP10 with aging, and this decrease of catecholamine levels was caused by impairment of their synthetic pathway. These impairments are considered to be caused by downregulation of TH phosphorylation at Ser40 as a result of PKA deficiency. The present study suggests that the decline of learning and memory abilities of SAMP10 is caused by a decrease in catecholamine synthesis in the cerebral cortex with aging.",

Compared to controls, the testosterone and SHBG levels were lower in male VaD patients, and the estradiol levels were higher in female VaD patients. The hormones levels were not correlated with cognitive functions among either male or female VaD patients. There were no associations between hormone levels and neuropsychiatric symptoms among male patients, while the TE2 and TT levels were positively associated with apathy and anxiety, respectively among female patients. Our findings suggested there were sex hormone level changes in VaD patients in comparison with cognitive normal controls. Sex hormones were associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms among female but not male VaD patients.",

     "abstract": "Most studies reflect dementia caregivers usually sustain higher levels of burden compared to other caregivers. However, they do not consider variability within the caregiver, such as personality traits. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of extraversion and neuroticism on dementia caregiver burden. A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted with 33 caregivers looking after demented-patients. All caregivers had intense burden levels, and their personality, depression, anxiety and self-rated health were evaluated. Personality variables had important effects on the caregiver burden and consequences on their mental health. Neuroticism was significantly correlated with burden (r\u00a0=\u00a00.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), depression (r\u00a0=\u00a00.68, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and both anxiety measures, state (r\u00a0=\u00a00.46, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and trait (r\u00a0=\u00a00.67, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Extraversion was significantly correlated with neuroticism (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.42, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and burden (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.46, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Finally, depression was significantly correlated with state (r\u00a0=\u00a00.63, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and trait anxiety (r\u00a0=\u00a00.66, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). These results indicate the importance of considering the caregiver personality in the theoretical and empirical models of the caring process. It is necessary to adequately assess the caregiver personality, as those presenting high levels of neuroticism and low levels of extraversion are more vulnerable to experience negative caring effects.",

Accordingly, we sought to investigate the relationship between exercise and mood, in early-stage AD patients (N\u00a0=\u00a0104) from California, over a 1-year period. Patients completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and Blessed-Roth Dementia Rating Scale (BRDRS), while their caregivers completed the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YALE), Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Functional Abilities Questionnaire (FAQ). Approximately half of the participants were female, from a variety of ethnic groups (Caucasian\u00a0=\u00a069.8%; Latino/Hispanic Americans\u00a0=\u00a020.1%). Our results demonstrated that the patients spent little time engaged in physical activity in general, their overall activity levels decreased over time, and this was paired with a change in global cognition (e.g., MMSE total score) and affect/mood (e.g., POMS score). Patients were parsed into Active and Sedentary groups based on their Yale profiles, with Active participants engaged in walking activities, weekly, over 1 year. Here, Sedentary patients had a significant decline in MMSE scores, while the Active patients had an attenuation in global cognitive decline. Importantly, among the Active AD patients, those individuals who engaged in walking for more than 2\u00a0h/week had a significant improvement in MMSE scores. Structured clinical trials which seek to increase the amount of time AD patients were engaged in walking activities and evaluate the nature and scope of beneficial effects in the brain are warranted.",

The present study investigated the validity of correlations between moderate physical activity and cognitive function using more objective and detailed assessments of both physical activity and neurocognitive function. Participants comprised 72 healthy elderly individuals who wore an electronic accelerometer during waking hours for 3 months. This device recorded the number of steps per day as well as the duration of each intensity level in daily life; levels 1\u20133 were the equivalent of easy-paced walking (light activity), while levels 4\u20136 corresponded to brisk walking (moderate activity). To estimate executive cognitive ability in healthy elderly individuals, performance variability of executive control was examined with a task-switching reaction time (RT) test measuring intra-individual variability (IIV) in RTs. In 43 consenting participants, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the task-switching RT trial was analyzed to assess differences in brain activity patterns as a function of daily physical activity. Daily duration of level 4 physical activity correlated negatively with and significantly predicted IIV. Moreover, fMRI analysis confirmed that the higher physical activity group (duration of level 4 activity\u00a0\u2265\u00a026.4\u00a0min/day) showed significantly reduced age-related functional attenuation of prefrontal activations during the task-switching RT trial. The study discusses the possibility that enhancing the moderate daily physical activity could be helpful for lowering the rate of neurocognitive degradations in healthy elderly individuals.",

Herein, we evaluated whether the combined use of 18F-N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2beta-carbon ethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane (FP-CIT) PET and cardiac MIBG scintigraphy can be used to help distinguish the prognosis in patients with DIP. Among 20 patients enrolled, 16 showed normal DAT uptake and normal myocardial sympathetic innervation. After withdrawal of the suspected drugs, the patients experienced a clinical remission of parkinsonian motor symptoms within 3 months and did not experience any new movement symptoms after at least 2 years of follow-up. Two patients with a moderate decrease in DAT uptake and impaired sympathetic denervation showed worsening of motor manifestations 3 months after discontinuation of the drugs. Another two patients with normal DAT uptake and decreased MIBG uptake, presented full remission of motor symptoms within 2 months after discontinuation of the drugs. However, these two patients eventually developed parkinsonism within 2 years of the follow-up period. The follow-up scans revealed severe decreased DAT uptake in the putamen and similar ranges of cardiac sympathetic denervation. The results suggest that the combined use of these techniques can predict the prognosis of DIP and suggest a proper therapeutic plan for DIP.",

     "abstract": "Recently, several studies have reported that muscle coactivation during static postural control increases with aging. Although greater muscle coactivation during quiet standing enhances joint stability, it may reduce dynamic postural control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of muscle coactivation during quiet standing on dynamic postural control. Seventy older adults (81.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.2 years) participated in this study. Static postural control was evaluated by postural sway during quiet standing, whereas dynamic postural control was evaluated by the functional reach and functional stability boundary tests. Electromyography of the soleus (SOL) and tibialis anterior (TA) was recorded during quiet standing, then coactivation was evaluated using the co-contraction index (CI). We used multiple regression analysis to identify the effect of muscle coactivation during standing on each dynamic postural control variable using age, body mass index (BMI), gender, timed up and go (TUG) tests, postural sway area and CI during quiet standing as independent variables. TUG tests were added to the model to evaluate the effect of functional mobility on dynamic postural control with a fixed base. The multiple regression analysis revealed that CI during standing was significantly related to all of the dynamic postural control tasks. The functional reach distance was significantly associated with CI during standing, age and TUG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The functional stability boundary for forward and backward were associated only with CI during standing (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). This study revealed that muscle coactivation during quiet standing is independently associated with dynamic postural control abilities.",

Group A received WEP for the first 12 weeks, followed by no intervention for the second 12 weeks. Group B did not receive intervention for the first 12 weeks and received WEP for the second 12 weeks. Voluntary Step Execution Test and postural stability in upright standing (eyes open and closed conditions) were measured at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks. A significant interaction effect between group and time was found for the step execution, due to improvement in initiation phase and swing phase durations in the WEP group. Also significant improvement in postural stability parameters in eyes open and closed conditions is noted. The present results indicate that the primary benefit of WEP that include perturbations to induce stepping, was a reduction in voluntary stepping times. The WEP generalized to a better control of balance in up-right standing.",

Criterion validity was evaluated by comparing SAIB scores with external criteria in 3 categories: subjective health, chronic illness and health care utilization. The originally suggested five factor structure of the SAIB yielded a comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.70 and the weighted root mean square residual (WRMR) was 3.68.

Effect sizes (Cohens d) of mean differences in factor scores between those with and without healthcare system contact varied by healthcare type, ranging from 0.05 to 0.94; effect sizes were largest in relation to contact with psychotherapy and alternative medicine practitioners. We propose a shortened version of the SAIB with a different scale structure, which resulted in better model fit with our data. Neither the original nor revised SAIB appeared to discriminate well in terms of health care use, suggesting that the illness behavior as currently conceptualized may not fully explain the increased use of healthcare in the elderly.",

     "abstract": "Elder self-neglect is associated with substantial 1-year mortality. However, hospice utilization among those with self-neglect remain unclear. The objective of this study is to quantify the prospective relation between self-neglect and risk for hospice utilization in a community population of older adults. Prospective population-based study in a geographically defined community in Chicago of older adults who participated in the Chicago Health and Aging Project. Of the 8669 participants in the Chicago Health and Aging Project, a subset of 1438 participants was reported to social services agency for suspected elder self-neglect. Outcome of interest was the hospice utilization obtained from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid System. Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess independent association of self-neglect with risk of hospice utilization using time-varying covariate analyses. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, elders who self-neglect was associated with increased risk for hospice utilization (HR, 2.43, 95% CI, 2.10\u20132.81). Greater self-neglect severity (mild: (HR, 2.12 (1.61\u20132.79); moderate: (HR, 2.36 (1.95\u20132.84); severe: (HR, 4.66 (2.98\u20137.30)) were associated with increased risk for hospice utilization. Interaction term analyses suggest that the significant relationship between self-neglect and hospice utilization was not mediated through medical conditions, cognitive impairment and physical disability. Moreover, self-neglect was associated with shorter length of stay in hospice (PE, \u22120.27, SE, 0.12, p\u00a0<\u00a00.02) and shorter time from hospice admission to death (PE, \u22120.32, SE, 0.13, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Elder self-neglect was associated with increased risk of hospice use in this community population. Elder self-neglect is associated with shorter length of stay in hospice care and shorter time from hospice admission to death.",

A cross-sectional survey was administered to 849 elderly people aged 60 years and over living in a certain district of Nanjing, China. A health rating scale based on the characteristics of the elderly in China was used. The difference of self-rated health between different groups was tested using an ANOVA, and the associated factors were tested using an ordinal logistic regression. The results showed that the general health of the elderly Chinese people studied was not good. The scores of body function, self-care ability, and physical health decreased gradually with age. The scores of men were higher than those of women in terms of emotional personality. The factors associated with the health status of the elderly were education, living mode and marital status. The health status of the elderly Chinese and the associated factors highlighted in this study demonstrated that emotional and social support were more important than financial support for promoting the mental health of the elderly. These findings will provide a basis for the development of programmes promoting the health management and healthy ageing of the elderly in China.",

This exploratory project aimed to provide information about the evacuation experiences and characteristics of vulnerable nursing home residents. Interviews with key informants from VHA facilities with nursing home staff and representatives revealed that physical harm, psychological distress, cognitive decline and increased social isolation were areas that deserved special attention for this vulnerable population. Moreover, physical, psychological and social needs were interconnected in that each influenced the others. Findings contribute to the general conversation about meeting the biopsychosocial needs of nursing home residents in an integrated healthcare delivery system and more broadly, the role of long-term care facilities in general in planning for future disasters.",

Structured face-to-face interviews with neurological and physical examinations were conducted to the 714 respondents. A current smoker was defined as a person who had been smoking at least one cigarette per day for 1\u00a0year, and a past smoker as a person who used to smoke but had not smoked in the past 1\u00a0year. Nicotine dependence was defined as having the Fagerstr\u00f6m Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND) score of 4 or higher. Age- and gender-standardized prevalence of ever smoker, past smoker and current smoker among the elderly Koreans aged 65 and over were estimated to be 36.3% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a032.7\u201339.8), 24.4% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a021.2\u201327.5) and 11.9% (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a09.5\u201314.3), respectively. Current smokers were much more prevalent in men (23.3%) than in women (3.9%), but did not decline with advancing age in both genders. 36.0% (21 men, 10 women) of the current smokers were nicotine-dependent. The smokers with depression or alcohol use disorder (AUD) were less likely and those who were educated more or inhaled smoke more deeply were more likely to quit smoking. Thus, smoking is common in the elderly men, and treatments of depression and AUD may be helpful in increasing smoking cessation rate among elderly Koreans.",

Purpose of the present study was to explore the prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers in long-term-care hospitals in Japan, and to identify factors associated with them. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 720 randomly sampled, long-term-care hospitals all over Japan. The prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers and their factors, including organizational strategies for pressure ulcer prevention and management, were examined. The mean prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers was 9.6 and 1.9% per month, respectively. Almost all hospitals had established an interdisciplinary team for pressure ulcer prevention, developed a clinical protocol for pressure ulcers, and implemented education for staff. However, 35% of the interdisciplinary teams were not useful, more than half of the clinical protocols were not used frequently, and about half of the wards did not have sufficient pressure-relieving mattresses. In multiple regression analyses, a low prevalence of pressure ulcers was associated with a lower ratio of clients with a high medical severity level (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034), the use of a clinical protocol including the management of preventive devices (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), the standardized pressure ulcer assessment tool (DESIGN-R; p\u00a0=\u00a00.017), and staff education (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). This study demonstrated a higher prevalence and incidence of pressure ulcers in long-term-care hospitals in Japan as compared to regular acute-care hospitals, as well as poor organizational strategies for managing pressure ulcers.",

Data suggest that older patients are among the main reservoirs of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) in the hospital. We hypothesized that older patients (\u226565 years of age) are more likely to harbor MDRO at hospital admission. We compared rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (MDRGN) recovered from clinical cultures within the first 48\u00a0h of admission to an adult acute care hospital between the elderly (\u226565 years old) and young per 1000 age-stratified admissions over a 12-year study period. Trends in antimicrobial resistance, sites of recovery and species for MDRGN were also characterized. An average of 7534 positive bacterial cultures were collected per year. The admission prevalence per 1000 age-stratified admissions was consistently higher among the elderly for all three MDRO under investigation. Among the elderly, the admission prevalence increased significantly for VRE (0.89 in 1998 to 3.62 in 2009 per 1000 admissions; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and MDRGN (1.41 in 1998 to 11.33 in 2009 per 1000 admissions; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Percentage resistant for all three MDRO increased as well. These data suggest that elderly patients are contributing substantially to the influx of MDRO into the hospital setting.",

Patient samples were analyzed to identify specific MDRBs, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobaceriaceae (ESBLE), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).Among 337 patients screened at hospital admission, 62 (18%) carried one or more MDRB isolates (MRSA: n\u00a0=\u00a023; ESBLE: n\u00a0=\u00a039; VRE: n\u00a0=\u00a02). At 12 months after admission, 320 patients were interviewed by telephone (17 patients lost to follow up) to assess all-cause mortality, nursing home admissions, functional decline, and hospital readmissions. All-cause mortality rates were similar in MDRB carriers (34%; n\u00a0=\u00a061) and non-carriers (30%; n\u00a0=\u00a0259) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.512). Nursing home admission, functional decline, and hospital readmission did not differ between the two groups. In this population, predictors of mortality were: male gender (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), cognitive disorders at admission (P\u00a0=\u00a00.028), low pre-albumin level at admission (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048), a high level of co-morbidities (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and a history of an acute condition in the three months prior to initial hospital admission (P\u00a0=\u00a00.024). In conclusion, in this cohort of older patients, asymptomatic MDRB colonization was not significantly associated with adverse health outcomes at a one-year follow-up after hospitalization. The potential limitations of the study were the small sample size, relatively high mortality rate, and lack of MDRB reassessment during the follow-up.",

Body Mass Index (BMI) was obtained by measuring the height and weight of the subjects. The results showed that 49.7% of the participants slept poorly. Binary logistic regression analysis indicated that chronic disease, advanced age, low quantities of staple food (g), rice as major food, poor Physical Component Summary (PCS), poor Mental Component Summary (MCS), and significant dysfunction of ADL were predictors for poor sleep quality. However, no association was found between BMI and sleep quality.

     "abstract": "The authors aimed to investigate whether a change in depressive status was associated with a change in the risk of mortality in the elderly during a four-year follow-up period. Data came from the Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan. A cohort of 1784 men and women in Taiwan aged 65 or older who were assessed on two occasions in 1999 and 2003, and subsequently followed up until 2007. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). The mortality risk of different depressive statuses was computed after adjustment for a variety of covariates. The data were further analyzed by gender and cause of death. Overall, chronic depression was associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.18\u20132.32) after 4\u00a0years of follow-up and controlling for covariates.

The increased risk of mortality with incident depression in males and chronic depression in females was attributed to non-cardiovascular disease (non-CVD) causes more than to CVD causes. In males, chronic depression predicted a higher incidence of CVD deaths. While chronic depression confers a greater risk of mortality in older women, incident depression predicts increased mortality in older men. The link between changing depressive status, gender, ethnicity and mortality warrants further investigation.",

Homebound status was defined as staying permanently inside the home, excluding an accident or a temporary illness. The influence of the homebound status on two-year mortality was assessed in a logistic regression model adjusted for the main confounders (age, sex, living as a couple, physical and mental impairments). The prevalence of homebound status was 4.7% (95% CI: 3.9\u20135.4) in this study. The number of homebound elderly was estimated at 421\u00a0000 in France.

This study aimed to examine the relationship of body composition with a wide variety of cardiometabolic risk factors among 2943 subjects (1250 men and 1693 women) aged 60 years or older from Korean National Health Examination and Nutrition Survey (KNHANES). Sarcopenia was defined as an appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) divided by weight (%) of <1 SD below the sex-specific mean for young adults. Obesity was defined as a body mass index (BMI) \u226525\u00a0kg/m2. Body composition was categorized into four non-overlapping groups: the sarcopenic obese, sarcopenic nonobese, nonsarcopenic obese, and nonsarcopenic nonobese groups. A wide variety of cardiometabolic risk factors, including blood pressure (BP), glucose tolerance indices, lipid profiles, inflammatory markers, and vitamin D level, were compared according to body composition group. The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity was 18.4% in men and 25.8% in women. In both sexes, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and metabolic syndrome was highly prevalent in the sarcopenic obese group. Serum insulin level, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), triglyceride levels, and ferritin levels were the highest in the sarcopenic obese group in both men and women, whereas HDL-cholesterol and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels were the lowest in the sarcopenic obese group.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to quantify differences in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures of corticospinal and intracortical excitability of the quadriceps between healthy, active older and younger adults.

Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were measured by superficial electromyographic recordings of the vastus lateralis (VL). Measures of corticospinal excitability using a double cone TMS coil included resting motor thresholds (RMT), resting recruitment curves (RRCs) and silent periods (SP). Intracortical excitability was measured using paired pulse paradigms for short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and intracortical facilitation (ICF). No statistically significant differences between older and younger adults were found for RMT, RRC slopes, SP, SICI or ICF measures (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The physically active nature of the older adults included in this study may have contributed to the lack of differences in corticospinal and intracortical excitability since physical activity in older adults attenuates age-related declines in neuromuscular function.",

Associations between body image and physical/mental health were also shown. Various tensions regarding the aging body (appearance vs. health, inside vs. outside, natural vs. unnatural) as well as a double standard of aging were also reported among older women.

     "abstract": "Depression is a major public health burden among the aging population. While older adults prefer non-pharmacological treatment, few options for psychotherapy are available in primary care settings, which is where older adults tend to receive mental health services. Indicated prevention is a cost-effective, public health approach to prevent major depressive disorder among people with depressive symptoms who do not yet meet standard criteria for major depression. We critically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that assessed the efficacy of psychotherapy among community-dwelling older adults with subthreshold depression (depressive symptoms that do not meet standard criteria for major depression). We examined the intervention types, results, internal validity, and external validity of five studies. We used the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) guidelines to rate the quality of the studies and to provide recommendations. Results suggest that psychotherapy is a safe and cost-effective method to reduce the public health burden of depression among older adults with subthreshold depression.",

This study examined the predictors of improvement in case-level depressive symptoms in the elderly. In this prospective cohort and population-based study in Taiwan, 206 non-demented and case-level depressed subjects aged 65 and older were interviewed at baseline in 2003 and follow-up in 2007. The independent variables included demographics, chronic medical diseases, and health-related behaviors assessed at baseline. The dependent variable was depressive symptoms, assessed using the 10-item short form of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD-10) assessed at follow-up. Multivariate analyses were used to identify the predictors of improvement in depression. The independent predictors of improvement in depression over a 4-year follow-up period are more social support and fewer mobility limitations at baseline. With regards to practical health-related behaviors, the 2 items of social support most associated with improvement in depression were willingness of significant others to talk with you and satisfaction with dependence upon significant others; the 2 items of mobility limitations most associated with non-improvement of depression were difficulty in carrying things and squatting. These findings suggested that health-related behaviors were important to the depression outcome in the elderly; moreover, interventions to improve depression should include practical health-related behaviors aimed at these modifiable risk factors.",

Using a randomized trial, this study examined the effect of a social isolation prevention program on loneliness, depression, and subjective well-being of the elderly in Japan. Among the elderly people who relocated to suburban Tokyo, 63 who responded to a pre-test were randomized and assessed 1 and 6 months after the program. Four sessions of a group-based program were designed to prevent social isolation by improving community knowledge and networking with other participants and community \u201cgatekeepers.\u201d The Life Satisfaction Index A (LSI-A), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Ando-Osada-Kodama (AOK) loneliness scale, social support, and other variables were used as outcomes of this study. A linear mixed model was used to compare 20 of the 21 people in the intervention group to 40 of the 42 in the control group, and showed that the intervention program had a significant positive effect on LSI-A, social support, and familiarity with services scores and a significant negative effect on AOK over the study period. The program had no significant effect on depression. The findings of this study suggest that programs aimed at preventing social isolation are effective when they utilize existing community resources, are tailor-made based on the specific needs of the individual, and target people who can share similar experiences.",

According to the protocol, we evaluated the burden, depression and anxiety of caregivers by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale, Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS). 90 caregivers of dementia patients and 90 caregivers of nondementia patients with other chronic diseases from 24 military communities in Beijing were enrolled in this investigation. The scores of burden, depression and anxiety increased from nondementia to severe dementia groups. There were associations between patient's CDR score and CBI score, as well as the average daily care time and CBI score. In addition, the scores of SDS and SAS were both positive correlated to CBI score. Comparing to general community, the caregivers of dementia veterans had lower scores in SDS and SAS. Therefore, we should pay more attentions to the caregivers of severe dementia patients. Reduction of daily care time is a possible way to releasing the burden of caregivers. Better general supports are beneficial to reducing depression and anxiety when caregivers confront the heavy burden.",

Research concerning strategies for predicting depression in the older adult population has not until recently focused on the possibility of measuring one's EI as a potential predictive factor. To address an aspect of this neglect, the present quantitative correlational study explored to what extent the total Emotional Quotient (EQ) scale score of EI predicted depression. Two self-report measures were utilized: the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short (GDS-Short), and the Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory:Short (EQ-i:S). A purposive sample of 128 men and women (ages 65 and older) were recruited from local recreation centers and independent living facilities. To determine the extent to which EQ-i:S scaled score predicted depression, multiple logistic regression analysis was carried out. After accounting for age, education, and anti-depressant use, EQ-i:S scaled score had a statistically significant effect OR\u00a0=\u00a00.94 (0.91, 0.97), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001. This result indicated that for every 1-point increase in EQ-i:S scaled score, the risk of having depression decreased by 6%. The results indicated that increased EI has a beneficial effect in terms of current depression status. Future longitudinal research in examining EI as a predictor for depression in the older adult population is needed to substantiate and expand upon these findings.",

Families with a depressed patient often report problematic family functioning in Western samples, and lack of social support is strongly associated with geriatric depression. However, the relationship between geriatric depression, family functioning and social support in mainland China has not been well studied.This study compared family functioning and social support in a Chinese sample of elderly patients with major depression and non-depressed elderly people, and evaluated the impact of family functioning, social support and socio-demographic factors on depression. A questionnaire was administered to 102 elderly patients with major depression and 107 non-depressed elderly people.The elderly patients with major depression had worse family functioning and lower social support than elderly individuals without depression. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed associations between depressive symptoms and unhealthy family functioning, lower social support and single marital status.The findings suggest that family interventions and improvement of social support are important in reducing depression among elderly patients. In addition, strategies to alleviate geriatric depression should be considered by the whole society, the community, family members and the depressed elderly patients themselves.",

The aim of this paper was to analyze associations between psychological, socio-demographic, functional aspects on the risk of social isolation, mortality and re-hospitalization in older persons.This is a longitudinal study on 580 hospitalized elderly sample aged \u226570\u00a0yrs recruited from 2005 to 2007 in the Geriatrics Operative Unit of INRCA in Fermo, Italy. The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) was used. Outcome measures included 36-month mortality and re-hospitalization.In all patients, approximately 20% (n\u00a0=\u00a0112) of the subjects were socially isolated. Women perceived their social support significantly worse than men (77.7 vs. 22.3%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of a poor social environment on health. Elderly Koreans generally had poor socioeconomic status and reported a high prevalence of poor health compared with middle-aged people.

     "abstract": "Classic developmental theory suggests that aging is associated with using compensatory strategies to prolong independence. While compensatory strategies are typically considered positive adaptations, they also signify an early phase in the disablement process \u2014 commonly known as pre-clinical disability. To build a better understanding of psychological constructs related to these early signs of disability, we examined the contribution of SE and state anxiety on using compensatory strategies among pre-clinically disabled older adults. Compensatory strategies were observed during performance of daily activities in 257 pre-clinically disabled older adults (67.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.04), and SE and state anxiety were evaluated prior to performing each task. In univariate models, lower SE and higher anxiety were associated with more compensation (Spearman correlations: 0.15\u20130.48, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Multivariate logistic regression indicated that low SE [Odds Ratio (OR): 1.70; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.40\u20132.08) and high anxiety (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.10\u20131.63) were positively associated with using \u22656 compensatory strategies \u2013 a level signifying substantial compensation. When considered jointly with SE, the association with anxiety was reversed \u2014 higher anxiety demonstrated a lower likelihood of using compensation (OR: 0.70\u20130.73; 95% CI: 0.50\u20130.99). The addition of SE might remove the self-defeating cognitions characterizing anxiety allowing the remaining arousal component to appear beneficial. In conclusion, lower SE and higher anxiety are associated with using compensation to complete daily tasks among pre-clinically disabled older adults. Such psychological constructs may contribute to the use of compensatory strategies and represent future intervention targets to help reduce early signs of disability.",

Responses to this questionnaire were used to measure health-promoting behaviors in a random sample of 1012 elderly Chinese from thirty communities in Xi\u2019an Shaanixi-Province.Factor analysis relied on polychoric correlations with ordinal categorical data were used to evaluate reliability and validity of a revised Chinese version of the health-promoting lifestyles profile (HPLP-C). Because this revised version was used to assess elderly adults, we termed it the HPLP-CE. This factor analysis supported a six-factor model of the original HPLP-C scale. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a good fit, with factors explaining 88.1% of the common variance of the HPLP-CE scores. Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficients were 0.91 for the revised instrument, and ranged from 0.67 to 0.88 for six dimensions. The split-half reliability was 0.92, while the test\u2013retest reliability was 0.68. Relationships between HPLP-CE, perceived health status, SF-36 scale scores, and associations with selected demographic variables were significantly positive.We concluded that this revised scale, based on the 40-item HPLP-C, was considered suitable for measuring health-promoting lifestyles of older adults in China. Mental and inner self-reflection planes were the most salient factors for assessing health-promoting behaviors of seniors. Such factors need to be considered if preventive programs are to be designed to promote seniors\u2019 health.",

Comparisons of retrospective audit data over two periods (use of the BHS-FRAT; post TNH-STRATIFY implementation) were used in the evaluation (n\u00a0=\u00a0362). Inter-rater reliability of the TNH-STRATIFY was evaluated from independent assessment by two nurses for 30 sub-acute patients and using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC2,1). Event rate (ER) and standard measures of predictive accuracy were calculated for both FRATs. The proportions of patients with documented fall prevention strategies addressing identified fall risk factors were compared between audit phases. The TNH-STRATIFY had high inter-rater reliability (ICC2,1\u00a0=\u00a00.96). The BHS-FRAT and TNH-STRATIFY demonstrated poor predictive accuracy using recommended high risk cut-off scores, with low specificityER (0.07 and 0.13 respectively) and very low Youden IndexER (0.04 and 0.07 respectively), although these measures improved using modified cut-off scores. Positive and negative predictive values were moderate for the BHS-FRAT (0.51, 0.64) and TNH-STRATIFY (0.52, 0.61). The falls rate and proportion of recurrent fallers did not change between audit phases. Implementation rates for prevention strategies for key risk factors were higher following implementation of the TNH-STRATIFY.

However, it is unknown whether or not the impairments documented in these populations can be extrapolated to elders with neck pain. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of neck pain on sensorimotor function in elders. Twenty elders with neck pain (12 women and 8 men) and 20 healthy elder controls (14 women and 6 men) aged 65 years and over were recruited from the general community. Tests for sensorimotor function included; cervical joint position sense (JPS); computerised rod-and-frame test (RFT); smooth pursuit neck torsion test (SPNT); standing balance (under conditions of eyes open, eyes closed on firm and soft surfaces in comfortable stance); step test and ten-meter walk test with and without head movement. Elders with neck pain had greater deficits in the majority of sensorimotor function tests after controlling for effects of age and comorbidities. Significant differences were found in the SPNT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), error in the RFT (frame angled at 10\u00b0 and 15\u00b0 anticlockwise) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), standing balance (amplitude of sway) \u2013 eyes open on a firm surface in the medio-lateral (ML) direction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03), and total number of steps on the step test, both left and right sides (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Elders with neck pain have greater sensorimotor disturbances than elders without neck pain, supporting a contribution of altered afferent information originating from the cervical spine to such disturbances.

Lower limbs muscle power training is currently an emerging concept in rehabilitation on individuals with decreased balance and mobility. In this prospective, controlled study, we used a human\u2013computer interactive video-game-based rehabilitation device (LLPR) for training of lower limb muscle power in the elderly. Forty (aged\u00a0>\u00a065\u00a0years) individuals were recruited from the community. Twenty participants in the exercise group received 30-min training, twice a week, using the LLPR system. The LLPR system allows participants to perform fast speed sit-to-stand (STS) movements. Twenty age-matched participants in the control group performed slow speed STS movements, as well as strengthening and balance exercises, with the same frequency and duration. The results were compared after 12 sessions (6\u00a0weeks) of training. The mechanical and time parameters during STS movement were measured using the LLPR system. Modified falls efficacy scale (MFES), Tinetti Performance-Oriented Mobility Assessment (POMA), function reach test, five times sit to stand (FTSS) and Timed Up and Go (TUG) were administered to participants as clinical assessments. Results showed that in the exercise group, all the mechanical and time parameters showed significant improvement. In control group, only the maximal vertical ground reaction force (MVGRF) improved significantly. For clinical assessments (balance, mobility, and self-confidence), exercise group showed significantly better scores. The STS movements in video-game-based training mimic real life situations which may help to transfer the training effects into daily activities. The effectiveness of lower limb muscle training is worthy of further investigation.",

The sample was derived from the 2002 \u201cTaiwan Three High Prevalence Survey\u201d database. Women were divided into three groups based on age and menstrual status. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves was applied to the anthropometric indicators of obesity including, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), to ascertain its value in predicting MS. 2848 cases were included. It was found that most MS component values were worse with age and following menopause. Obesity indicators showed poor predictability for MS risks in post-menopausal women over 65 years, but good predictability in women under 65 years; our study revealed the following as ideal cut-off values for non-menopausal female: WHtR\u00a0<\u00a00.49, WC\u00a0<\u00a078\u00a0cm, WHR\u00a0<\u00a00.79, BMI\u00a0<\u00a024\u00a0kg/m2; for menopausal women, WHtR\u00a0<\u00a00.54, WC\u00a0<\u00a083\u00a0cm, WHR\u00a0<\u00a00.84, BMI\u00a0<\u00a024.4\u00a0kg/m2. It was concluded that obesity alone is not a reliable predictor of MS risks in women over the age of 65, and cut-off values for obesity indicators need to be further reduced in non-menopausal women.",

In this study we compare the serum hcy and antioxidant levels in patients with osteoporosis, osteopenia and control subjects. A total of 2190 elderly persons (1348 patients with osteoporosis, 643 patients with osteopenia and 199 control subjects) who were referred to the outpatient clinic of the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Geriatric Medicine at Hacettepe University Hospital for comprehensive geriatric assessment were included in this cross-sectional study.

Shc is the most versatile bipartite phosphotyrosine signal adaptor harboring phosphotrosine-biding (PTB) and Src-homology2 (SH2) domains. Among the Shc adaptor family members, p66-Shc is of potential interest in aging studies, since its deletion in mice resulted in a longer lifespan and/or higher quality of life in later stages of life. However, a few studies have examined the gene expression profiles of p66-Shc in aging tissues. Here, we quantified the expression levels of transcripts of Shc-related isoforms in the liver and brain of young adult, middle-aged, and aged rats, and found that p66-Shc gene expression is specifically up-regulated in the aged liver and brain. In the aged liver tissue, p66-Shc expression was also evident at the protein level, and accumulated in the soluble fraction of the aged tissue. These results indicate that p66-Shc is not only related to animal longevity but also affected during aging, and thus the repression of p66-Shc could become a potential target for an anti-aging strategy.",

However, experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis has not been established. Here we take a bioinformatics data mining approach, utilizing pre-existing data, to study cardiac aging gene expression data in mice. Contrary to the hypothesis, our study shows that the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is down-regulated in aged heart in mice. Nutrition treatment, with calorie restriction and Resveratrol supplementation, known to retard aging, opposes heart aging by restoring Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling level in the old heart. In addition, the expression of \u03b2-catenin gene, a key regulator of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway, decreases up to 3-fold in aged heart, but is restored to levels found in young heart with methods of nutrition intervention.

The single question yielded low sensitivity (30.9%) and high specificity (93.9%) for mild hearing loss. Similarly HHIE-S yielded a sensitivity of 26.2% and specificity of 95.9%. Sensitivity with single question increased to 76.2% and specificity decreased to 83.1% with severe hearing loss. Sensitivity with HHIE-S also increased to 76.2% and specificity decreased to 87.7% with severe hearing loss.

This aspect is correlated with the major frequency of maturity onset diabetes in elderly (MODE), compared to the centenarians, correlated also to the mortality of diabetes mellitus (DM) of long duration. The DMT2 and the aging interact in the determinism of vascular alterations, i.e., of the hypertension, and related cardio-cerebrovascular complications. The most frequently occurring hypertension in both the elderly and centenarians was always the systolic-isolated one. The prevalence of hypertension and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was statistically significantly higher in diabetics, compared to the normoglycemic patients, in both the elderly and the centenarians. In addition, in a group of 914 elderly patients, being diabetics or normoglycemic at the start of the studies, but having neither AMI nor stroke at the baseline studies, after 5 years, these complications were more prevalent, significantly in statistical terms, in the diabetic subjects, compared to the normoglycemic ones. The increase of life-span causes an increase of the age when the aging phenomena appear, resulting in that the equal-age elderly people today are of better clinical conditions, compared to the previous periods. The increased life span with a consequent progressive aging of the population causes a worse general clinical state of the elderly population, characterized by polypathologies, frailty, and appearance of cognitive deficits or incapabilities for performing manual or instrumental activities.",

It tended to decrease with age in men, but not in women. MetS was inversely related to education in women, but not in men. The most prevalent individual components of MetS were as follows: hypertension (64.4%), abdominal obesity (55%), and decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL C) (46%) for women; and hypertension (71%) and fasting hyperglycemia (35.2%) for men. An elevated level of triglycerides (TG) was the rarest MetS component, affecting 23.5% of women and 22.1% of men. The higher female prevalence of MetS was attributable to abdominal obesity. MetS was found to be associated with markers of insulin resistance (IR), low-grade inflammation, and insufficient fibrinolysis. Although the metabolic burden is an important contributor to high levels of ill-health and cardiovascular mortality among elderly Russians (especially women), it does not explain why cardiovascular mortality is much higher in Russia than in other industrialized countries.",

Moreover, a significant interaction between anemia and the severity of WMH was observed in performance on the Go/no go test (F\u00a0=\u00a04.50, p\u00a0=\u00a00.012) and the Stroop test (F\u00a0=\u00a03.36, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037). In post hoc analysis, anemic patients with severe WMH had significantly worse scores on measure of executive function (Go/no go test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011; Stroop test, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Anemia and WMH had interactive effects on executive function impairment among the elderly with amnestic MCI.",

From January 2000 to December 2007, 131 consecutive patients aged 75 years or older received adjuvant radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery. Eighty-two patients received radiotherapy in combination with 5 years of hormone therapy with tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor. Thirty out of 131 received chemotherapy. Variables considered were age, stage, co-morbidity, performance status, radiation dose (boost), hormone therapy and chemotherapy. The mean age was 78.3 years (range 75\u201388 years). A total of 19.1% of the patients had no co-morbidity, 57.38% mild, 19.8% moderate, and 3.8% had severe co-morbidities. All patients but one completed the planned radiation schedule. At a median follow-up of 56 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 78.8%. There was a better survival for patients with no or mild co-morbidities (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The disease-free survival at 5 years was 89.6%. No difference in acute and late toxicity rates was found between patients with different ACE-27 (Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27) indexes and for different age. We conclude that compliance with adjuvant radiotherapy is good and rate of toxicity is acceptable in elderly patients. Patients with no or mild co-morbidities have a significantly better survival. Increasing severity of co-morbidity may sufficiently shorten remaining life expectancy to cancel gains with adjuvant radiotherapy. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.",

We examined regional and whole-gut transit time (WGTT) with wireless motility capsule (WMC) and compared this with radioopaque markers (ROM) transit. 39 constipated and 11 healthy older subjects (\u226565 years) ingested a ROM capsule and WMC, wore a data receiver and kept stool diaries for 5 days. WMC recordings were analyzed for colonic transit time (CTT), WGTT and gastric emptying time (GET). Radiographs obtained on day 5 assessed ROM transit. Results for each device were compared. The CTT (p\u00a0=\u00a0<0.0001), WGTT (p\u00a0=\u00a0<0.001) and GET (p\u00a0=\u00a0<0.04) as measured by WMC were all slower in constipated subjects compared to healthy subjects. ROM colonic transit was also slower (p\u00a0=\u00a0<0.007) in constipated compared to healthy subjects. The diagnostic utility for identifying subjects with constipation as assessed by receiver operating characteristics were similar; 0.85 (WMC) versus 0.73 (ROM). Device agreement for slow colonic transit was 88% with good correlation between WMC and ROM (CTT r\u00a0=\u00a00.718, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001, WGTT r\u00a0=\u00a00.693, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). Slow transit constipation was identified in 28% with ROM and 32% with WMC. No adverse events were recorded. WMC is a safe and useful device that provides objective diagnosis of delayed colonic and whole gut transit in older constipated adults.

Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association of demographic, socioeconomic, lifestyle and health-related variables with changes in smoking status at baseline, or with subsequent changes in smoking status in 50\u201366-year-old male Taiwanese. Functional impairment was the strongest predictor of quitting smoking for 50\u201366-year-old Taiwanese men. Other factors including a first hospitalization, emergency visit, or diagnosis of heart disease, quitting drinking, living with a spouse and older age were associated with increased likelihood of quitting smoking. Men with long smoking history, heavy daily cigarette consumption and more formal education were less likely to quit. Results suggest that functional decline is the major cause for quitting smoking for older Taiwanese men. Physical impairment and traumatic diseases that cause physical impairment have the most impact whereas \u201csilent diseases\u201d such as hypertension or diabetes have little impact. These findings should be useful for designing target-specific intervention strategies for older male Taiwanese smokers.",

VBF can be inadvertently overlooked on radiological examinations, which may delay diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. This hospital-based study evaluated chest radiographs to determine the prevalence rate of unrecognized VBF.

All patients were over 55 years of age. Posterior\u2013anterior (PA) and lateral chest radiographs were available for all patients. All selected chest radiographs were reviewed by two radiologists who were blinded to the official reports. Comparisons between official reports and the reference reports determined the prevalence of unrecognized VBF. Chest radiographs from 1655 patients (mean age 71.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.4 years, 63.9% male) were reviewed. The prevalence of recognized VBF was significantly higher in consensus reports compared to the official reports (23.0% vs. 4.8%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Overall, 79% of VBFs were undiagnosed.

Adjusted for age, gender was not an independent risk factor for unrecognized VBF in logistic regression. In conclusion, the high rate of unrecognized VBF in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan highlights the need to improve radiographic recognition of VBF, which could aid early treatment of osteoporosis in older adults.",

Design: Prospective inception multicenter cohort study. Setting: Three tertiary Hospitals. Participants: 806 patients consecutively admitted with HF. Measurements: 1-Year mortality, the loss of 1 or more functional abilities in activities of daily living (ADLs), and the recovery/maintenance of independent ambulation at 6 months from the fracture. Results: On the whole sample, 71.1% of patients survived 1 year from the fracture. In one hospital the risk of 1-year mortality was significantly higher even after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, prefracture functional status and cognitive impairment (odd ratio (OR) 1.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15\u20132.18, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). This was principally explained by a longer time to surgery (5.2 days\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2 vs 2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3 and 2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The three hospitals also differed in the rate of subjects losing the ability in ADLs after 6 months from the fracture (54.2%, 61%, 43.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016), while no statistical differences were found in the recovery of independent ambulation. On the basis of multivariate models, a lower access to post-acute rehabilitation could account for lower outcome in functional status. Conclusions: This study suggests that system factors such as time to surgery and rehabilitation resources can affect functional recovery and 1-year mortality in orthogeriatric units and they could explain different outcomes when comparing care models.",

Old age was associated with over-reporting whereas having no health checkup during the past 12 months was associated with under-reporting. The relatively low agreement between self-reports and clinically measured hypertension (JNC-6 definition) was mainly due to the lack of a well-defined hypertension practice guideline and the failure of clinicians to clearly inform patients of their diagnoses. The consistency of hypertension practice guidelines and the effectiveness of informing the patients of their diagnoses are two main factors impacting the quality of self-report of hypertension in elderly Taiwanese.

     "abstract": "In the last decades, extensive research efforts have been directed at exploring life satisfaction in old age, and the Life Satisfaction Index A (LSIA) scale, developed by Neugarten et al. in the 1960s, is one of the most commonly used instruments. However, studies have focused on predicting and comparing changes in people's life satisfaction without testing if the LSIA instrument is equally valid for different subgroups of people. The present study investigated the underlying dimensions of the LSIA in a Swedish population (n\u00a0=\u00a01402) of people 60\u201396 years of age. The study also examined factorial invariance across age, gender, functional ability and depression during a six-year period. The results showed that while a five-factor solution of the LSIA did not exhibit an acceptable fit to the data, a three-factor solution did show a close fit. The two three-factor models that demonstrated the best fit showed invariance across gender and across time, but noninvariance across groups with different levels of reduced functional ability, depressive symptoms and age. These findings suggest that the psychometric properties of life satisfaction instruments like the LSIA need to be taken into consideration before drawing conclusions about life satisfaction when comparing older people of different ages and with different depression and function levels.",

A comprehensive geriatric pain assessment (Geriatric Pain Scale, GPS) and health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) assessment (Nottingham Health Profile, NHP) were performed.Of the 275 patients, 76% were female and 59.6% were older than 70 years of age. Two hundred seventy four patients (99.7%) had various levels of pain. The mean age of the patent group was 72.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7 (min: 65, max: 96) years. The overall GPS was 60.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022 (min: 0, max: 99.9), and the total NHP score was 49.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.4 (min: 0, max: 100). Correlation analyses showed that for the total GPS score, female gender, lower education, and economic status were significant determinants of higher levels of pain. The multiple linear regression analysis showed that the NHP, GPS, Self-Reported Disability Index (SRDI), and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were significant determinants of poorer HR-QOL.There was a high prevalence of pain and being female, having low income, having low social support, having a higher rate of disability with related multiple comorbidities, and depression as related factors of HR-QOL. Strengthening these negative predictors of HR-QOL might enhance the efficiency of pain therapies in this population.",

We also sought to determine factors associated with global SRH and time-comparative SRH measures. A prospective cohort study of 5583 community-dwelling older men aged 70 years or over living in Perth, Western Australia, was used. Older age, depressive symptoms, low social support, sensory impairment, presence of pain, and high Charlson score index were associated with both SRH measures. Global and time-comparative SRH were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, HR\u00a0=\u00a01.24 vs. 1.41 respectively); and the risk of death was almost doubled in those with both negative global SRH and perception of worsening health over the preceding 12 months (adjusted HR 1.98, 95%CI 1.58\u20132.47). In this group, the rate of death was especially high during the initial four years of follow up. We concluded that the two measures of SRH are likely to reflect the same domains of health, and the simultaneous use of both measures is the best predictor of short to medium term mortality.",

Indicators of health care utilization were: visit to a general practitioner (gp), contacts with health care professionals (hcps), hospital admission, receiving personal care, receiving nursing care, and receiving informal care.After controlling for background characteristics, the TFI predicted disability and the indicators of health care utilization. Interviews and physical measures of frailty improved the prediction of disability. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) improved the prediction of contacts with hcps, but the interview and physical measures of frailty did not improve the predictions of the other indicators of health care utilization.Assessment by the self-report TFI is sufficient for predicting six indicators of health care utilization, but for predicting disability the use of both the TFI and the Timed Up & Go (TUG) test is recommended. It is advisable assessing all three frailty domains when examining frailty and its prediction of adverse outcomes.",

The present study on the COSA (abbreviated from the Italian name: \u201cCentro Osservazione Salute Anziani\u201d) has the aim to investigate the effects of a new form called Specialistic Geriatric Assistance on the already existing geriatric services in our territory, like UVG (Unit\u00e0 Valutazione Geriatrica), ADI (Assistenza Domiciliare Integrata), MMG (Medici di Medicina Generale). The present preliminary studies were carried out a group of elderly people frequenting the elderly day center \u201cVilla Angela\u201d located in Catania. We enrolled 42 subjects, 29 females and 13 males, in the age-range of 65\u201389 years (mean\u00a0=\u00a073.6 years). An evaluation protocol was used for the participants, having two parts. The first part was a general one performing an accurate anamnestic examination, while the second part evaluated the cognitive and affective spheres, and the levels of autonomy and autosufficiency. The data obtained show that that the elderly population of the daily center \u201cVilla Angela\u201d in Catania is affected by numerous pathologies and comorbidities, which all increase the total risk of disabilities. The subjects use a high number of medicines (sometimes more than 10), which is not always justified by the pathologies found in them. Considering the functional profiles of the patients, the sanitary services offered to them are appropriate, because almost all of the elderly people were autonomous and autosufficient, having still adequate physical performances. The higher cognitive performance seemed to be reduced in more than 50% of the patients, showing almost always a slight or moderate deterioration. The depressive state measured by the GDS seemed to reach the deflection of joy of life 54.8%, while the established depression was detected in 12%. These results emphasize the importance of the functional psychogeriatric screening, which is able to reveal an early diagnosis of depression in the geriatric ages. For this, and many other motifs, we believe that these preliminary examinations suggest to organize at least one COSA available to our elderly people.",

A total of 444 older adults were classified based on the LTCI system as independent, vulnerable, or dependent, and 400 of these participants also fit Fried's criteria for not frail, pre-frail or frail. We evaluated their physical function with a 12 item physical function test. We derived a physical function score (PFS) from these 12 items and a principal component analysis was used to make comparisons. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to identify the sensitivity and specificity of the PFS cut-off points to distinguish the dependent category from the other categories. We found significant differences and a hierarchical order for the PFSs among the three groups of the LTCI system (the independent, 0.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54; the vulnerable, \u22120.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.76; and the dependent, \u22121.49\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.73) and of Fried's definition (not frail, 0.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.51; pre frail, \u22120.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63; and frail, \u22121.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.98). The optimal cut-off value (OCV) was \u22120.593. This study showed that the range of physical function of people considered frail category (pre-frail, vulnerable, and frail) is wide and overlapping. That is, the physical function of vulnerable older adults is worse than the pre-frail, but better than the frail. To better recognize older adults in need of greater support, the vulnerable should also receive assessment of their frailty status according to Fried's definition.",

We aimed to identify whether composite scores of performance measures, particularly the lower extremity performance (LEP) score, upper extremity performance (UEP) score, and an overall score, are more accurate than usual gait speed (UGS) for assessing a wide range of functional status. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis on data from 701 community-dwelling older women (mean age 74.3 years). Trained testers measured UGS and the seven tests included in the composite scores. Using self-reported questionnaires, we assessed multiphasic functional status: physical function, higher-level functional capacity, mobility limitation, activities of daily living (ADLs), and falls. We compared the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of UGS with LEP, UEP, and overall scores for each status. We found no significant differences between the AUCs of UGS and LEP score for each status. The UEP score had significantly smaller AUCs for low physical function (0.73) and mobility limitation (0.78) than UGS alone (0.81 and 0.85, respectively), and the differences were substantial. Although the overall score had significantly greater AUCs for low higher-level functional capacity (0.83) and ADLs disability (0.83) than UGS alone (0.78 and 0.80, respectively), the differences were only 3\u20135%. The UGS should not be regarded solely as a measure of lower extremity function; this single test may represent overall physical performance. The UGS alone, which can be measured quickly and easily, suffice for assessing a wide range of functional status in older women.",

Disability-based case-mix classifications identify meaningful groups of older people; yet transitions between profiles are mostly unknown.Disability was assessed annually over four years with the Functional Autonomy Measurement System (SMAF) in 1410 older people at risk of functional decline aged 75 and over and living at home. The SMAF generates a case-mix classification of 14 Iso-SMAF profiles with progressive mean disability levels. Transitions made by older people were analyzed using a continuous-time, multi-state Markov model to estimate the probabilities of annual transitions into and out of each profile as well as the mean sojourn time in each profile.The probability of staying in a profile tended to decrease as profile severity increased. For profiles 5 and above, recovery to mild profiles 1, 2 and 3 was low, while annual probabilities of death and institutionalization were high (>0.10). The lower disability profiles (1 and 2) evidenced a mean profile sojourn time of over two years, contrary to sojourn times of 18 months or less with the other profiles.The probabilities are identifiable, indicating that a disability-based classification can characterize progression in older people. Since the required resources and costs are known for each profile, these probabilities are very helpful in planning home services for elderly populations.",

Materials and methods: Cohorts of 637 Swedish and 851 Iranian 75-year-olds were investigated with the same methods regarding physical activity level, physical functioning and health related factors. Results: There were differences in physical activity level (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), self-reported physical functioning (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) objective physical functioning (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), health status (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and most socio-demographic aspects between the two countries.

In 2000, 1634 elderly with no difficulties regarding ADL (modified Katz Index) were selected. These activities were reassessed in 2006 and disability was the outcome for the analysis of determinants. The following characteristics were analyzed at baseline: socio-demographic, behavioral, health status, medications, falls, hospitalizations, depressive symptoms, cognition, handgrip, mobility and balance. The incidence density was 42.4/1000 women/year and 17.5/1000 men/year. After adjusting for socioeconomic status and health conditions, women with chronic diseases and social vulnerability continued to have a greater incidence of disability. The following were determinants of the incidence of disability: age and depressive symptoms in both genders; stroke and slowness on the sit-and-stand test among men; and osteoarthritis and sedentary lifestyle among women. Better cognitive performance and handgrip strength were protective factors among men and women, respectively. Adverse clinical and social conditions determine differences between genders regarding the incidence of disability. Decreased mobility and balance and health conditions that affect the central nervous system or lead to impaired cognition disable men more, whereas a sedentary lifestyle, reduction in muscle strength and conditions that affect the osteoarticular system disable women more.",

Ninety-eight paid caregivers (eighty-five female and thirteen male), recruited from multiple sites (i.e. senior centers, shopping malls, local parks, lobbies of senior apartments, caregiver agency meetings) completed face-to-face questionnaires and semi-structured interviews. We found that 60.7% of participants chose to become a caregiver because they enjoyed being with seniors while 31.7% were unable to obtain other work, and 8.2% stated it was a prerequisite to a different health related occupation. Caregivers stated that the most challenging conditions of their work were physical lifting (24.5%), behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (24.5%), senior depression/mood changes (18.4%), attachment with impending death (8.2%), missing injuries to client (5.1%), lack of sleep (4.1%), and lack of connection with outside world (3.1%).

The mean length of event-free time was significantly longer in the Group I than in Group II (18.5\u00a0weeks, 95% CI 15.4\u201321.7 vs. 14.8\u00a0weeks, 95% CI 11.1\u201318.4; p\u00a0=\u00a00.049). Conclusion: If the current osteoporosis guideline is applied for older adults with low vision, it would be worthwhile putting more emphasis on the inclusion of patient-tailored strength and balance exercises to improve balance and potentially reduce the risk of falls.",

The exercise program consisted of counseling, balance- and progressive resistance training and support from the physical therapist at Geriatric Day-Hospital (GDH) and home for the Intervention-group. The Control-group received counseling, balance-training and support from the physical therapist. The sample was recruited from a GDH in Norway. 108 participants were randomized into the Intervention group (IT) (n\u00a0=\u00a053) or the Control group (CT) (n\u00a0=\u00a055). After 3 months 77 participants were tested. The intention to treat analysis showed that the program had significant benefits in terms of Health Related Quality of Life, measured by SF-36, on the domains vitality and bodily pain, in favor of the IT-group who performed the combined resistance exercises and balance program. All participants increased their scores on physical function, measured by Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up and Go, 5 times Sit-to-Stand, 6\u00a0Min Walk Test and Activities Balance Confidence Scale, no group differences. Both groups were adherent to the home exercise program The results show that it is possible to facilitate older people to increase their HRQL, physical function and level of physical activity through counseling, exercise and support from physical therapists.",

The data presented here are from 190 participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) aged from 32 to 93\u00a0years. Based on two age thresholds that best capture the effect of age on walking speed, participants were divided into three age groups: middle-age (32\u201357\u00a0years; N\u00a0=\u00a027), old-age (58\u201378\u00a0years; N\u00a0=\u00a0125), and oldest-age (79\u201393\u00a0years; N\u00a0=\u00a038). Participants were asked to walk at their preferred and maximum speeds while recorded with 3D gait analysis system. In addition, maximum isokinetic knee extensor strength was assessed. While walking at preferred speed, range of motion (ROM) and mechanical work expenditure (MWE) of the ankle were lower within middle-age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, p\u00a0=\u00a00.047, respectively), while hip ROM and MWE were lower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), respectively within oldest-age with older age. Deterioration in ankle function during customary walking initiates already at middle-age.

We aimed to identify whether combining UEP measures can more accurately discriminate upper extremity functional limitation (UE limitation) and disability compared to UGS. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis on data from 322 community-dwelling older women, aged 65\u201396 years. Trained testers assessed UGS, and hand-grip strength (GRIP), functional reach (FR), back scratch, manipulating pegs (PEG), and moving beans with chopsticks as UEP measures. We assessed three functional statuses: UE limitation, activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental ADLs (IADLs) disabilities using self-reported questionnaires. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were used to compare the discriminating power of UGS, with the individual and combined UEP measures for each status. Among UEP measures, only GRIP (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.68 for UE limitation, 0.81 for IADLs disability, and 0.84 for ADLs disability) could accurately discriminate each status as well as UGS (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.65, 0.83, and 0.91, respectively). Furthermore, UGS alone could discriminate UE limitation almost as well as the combination of GRIP, PEG, and FR (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.70). Combining other UEP measures did not help discriminate further. There were few advantages to combining UEP measures, and UGS or GRIP alone may suffice for assessing UE limitation and disability. However, the UGS should be the test of first choice, certainly more than GRIP, in routine assessment of functional limitation and disability, including UE limitation.",

     "abstract": "LRTI are among the most common diseases in developed countries, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the most frequent conditions. Their treatment in general practice is often unsuccessful and this increases hospital admissions. We know, bacterial infections in the elderly show a higher morbidity and mortality, either for more severe symptoms, than in younger adults, or because the causing agent often remains unknown. The need for a quick initiation of ABT often requires to chose on empirical grounds. To date there are no official guidelines for empirical ABT of COPD exacerbations, but only heterogeneous and often conflicting recommendations exist. The aim of our study was to identify a tool to guide the choice of the most effective empirical ABT when symptoms are acute and bacteriological tests cannot be performed. We used an ANN to study 117 patients aged between 55 and 97 years (mean 81.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.7 years) (\u00b1S.D.), admitted with a diagnosis of pneumonia, COPD exacerbation or pneumonia with respiratory failure. We registered symptoms at onset and some individual variables such as age, sex, risk factors, comorbidity, current drug therapies. Then the ANN was applied to choose ABT in 20 patients versus 20 subjects whose therapy was chosen by the physicians, comparing these groups for therapy's efficacy, mean durations of therapy and hospitalization (H). In the learning phase, the ANN could predict the resolution index 99.05% of the time (i.e., 104 times) with a \u00b1S.D.\u00a0=\u00a00.23. After the training, during the test phase, the network predicted the resolution index 91.67% of the time (i.e., 11 times) with a \u00b1S.D.\u00a0=\u00a00.54, thus proving the validity of the relations identified during the learning phase. Preliminary results of the application of our tool, show the ANN allowed us to greatly reduce the duration of the ABT and subsequently of the H. Based on preliminary results, we assume that the use of ANN can make a valuable contribution in the choice of empirical ABT in the course of acute lung diseases in elderly.",

Following a standard procedure, two different frailty index (FI) measures were constructed from 37 deficits by dividing the recorded deficits by the total number of measures. One version excluded disability and co-morbidity items, the other included them. Time to death was measured for up to five years. Frailty was defined using either the frailty phenotype or a cut-point applied to each FI. Of people defined as frail using the frailty phenotype, 15/416 (3.6%) experienced neither disability nor co-morbidity. Using 0.25 as the cut-point score for the FI (without disability/co-morbidity) resulted in 101/1176 (8.6%) frail participants that had neither disability nor co-morbidity. Activities of daily living (ADL) limitations and co-morbidities occurred more often among people with the highest levels of frailty. The first ADLs to become impaired with increasing frailty were bathing, managing medication, and cooking with more than 25% of older adults with a FI score (without disability/co-morbidity) >0.22 experiencing dependency on them. The hazard ratio (HR) per 0.1 increase in FI score was 1.25 (95% CI: 1.20\u20131.30) when disability and co-morbidity were included in the index and 1.21 (1.16\u20131.25) when they were not included. In conclusion, disability and co-morbidity greatly overlap with other deficits that might be used to define frailty and add to their ability to predict mortality.",

Sarcopenia was characterized by low muscle mass, plus low muscle strength or low physical performance. Subjects without low muscle mass, low muscle strength, and low physical performance were classified as \u201cnormal.\u201d Examination of higher-level functional capacity was performed using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence (TMIG-IC).

The percentage of disability for instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) was 39.0% in men with sarcopenia and 30.6% in women with sarcopenia. After adjustment for age, in men, sarcopenia was significantly associated with IADL disability compared with intermediate and normal subjects. In women, sarcopenia was significantly associated with every subscale of the TMIG-IC disability compared with intermediate and normal subjects. This study revealed that sarcopenia, defined by muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance, had a significant association with disability in higher-level functional capacity in elderly Japanese subjects.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between age-related thigh muscle loss and gait performance. Fifty-three women aged 52\u201383 years had their thigh muscle thickness (MTH) measured by ultrasound at five sites on the anterior (30%, 50%, and 70% of thigh length) and posterior (50% and 70% of thigh length) aspects of their thigh. Maximum and normal walking speeds, zig-zag walking time, and maximal voluntary isometric knee extension and flexion strength were measured. Age was inversely correlated to the anterior and posterior MTH ratio (e.g., anterior 50%:posterior 70% MTH ratio [r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.426, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002]), thus the site-specific muscle loss of the thigh was observed in the present sample.

Since quadriceps is important for mobility, it was selected for the present study.To investigate: (i) between-day intra-rater reliability of a novice user of MyotonPRO; (ii) between-side symmetry of mechanical properties of quadriceps in older males.Twenty healthy, community dwelling, right-lower-limb-dominant males (mean age 71.7, range 65\u201382 years) were studied.

Tests were performed on two occasions at the same time and day of the week, one week apart.Repeated measurements had very high within-day (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC 3,1\u00a0>\u00a00.90) and high between-day (ICC 3,2\u00a0>\u00a00.70; mean of two measurement sets) reliability. There was no statistically significant difference between muscle mechanical properties of the dominant and non-dominant muscles (<2.5% difference; p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), thereby indicating symmetry.High intra-rater reliability was established for MyotonPRO measurements of quadriceps in healthy older males, which were symmetrical between sides. These findings indicate that larger studies are warranted to establish normal reference ranges of data with which to compare patients with muscle abnormalities.",

Sociodemographic variables, smoking status, medical conditions, BMI, WC, and activities of daily living (ADL) were obtained.Prevalence of high WC (HWC) (>88\u00a0cm) in women ranged from 48.5% (Havana) to 72.7% (Mexico City), while among men (>102\u00a0cm) it ranged from 12.5% (Bridgetown) to 32.5% (Santiago). The associations between WC and ADL disability were \u201cJ\u201d shaped, with higher risks of ADL disability observed above 110\u00a0cm for women in Bridgetown, Santiago, Havana, and Montevideo. The association in Sao Paulo is plateau with higher risk above 100\u00a0cm, and the association in Mexico City is closer to linear. Among men the associations were \u201cU\u201d (Bridgetown, Sao Paulo, and Havana), \u201cJ\u201d shaped (Montevideo), plateau (Santiago), and closer to linear in Mexico City. When WC and BMI were analyzed together, we found that participants from Sao Paulo, Santiago, Havana, and Montevideo in the overweight or obese category with HWC were significantly more likely to report ADL disability after adjusting for all covariates.The findings of this study suggest that both general and abdominal adiposity are associated with disability and support the use of WC in addition to BMI to assess risk of disability in older adults.",

The study group consisted of 410 patients with maxillary complete dentures and various mandibular dentitions from seven rest homes in Istanbul. The data; including hypermobile tissue in the anterior part of the maxilla, occlusal relationship, nocturnal wear, denture age, and duration of the maxillary full edentulism period were recorded. A chi-square test was performed to analyze the effects of following data: Existence of mandibular anterior teeth, poor adaptation of the dentures, nocturnal wear, types of occlusal contacts, and gender, on the resorption of the anterior part of the maxilla. To examine the effects of the presence of anterior mandibular teeth and early maxillary edentulism on bone resorption in the anterior part of the maxilla, a logistic regression analysis was performed. The results reveal that patients with edentulous maxilla and natural mandibular anterior teeth are approximately twice more likely to show risk of hypermobile tissue in the anterior part of the maxilla than are full edentulous patients. Further, edentulous periods exceeding 30 years in maxilla seem to increase this risk approximately 4 times.",

There is now a substantial body of work studying the effect of oral care on the prevention of respiratory diseases. Oral hygiene, consisting of oral decontamination and mechanical cleaning by dental professionals, has resulted in significant clinical effects (decreased incidence of pneumonia and decreased mortality from respiratory diseases) in clinical randomized trials. Moreover, studies examining oral colonization by pneumonia pathogens have shown the effect of oral hygiene on eliminating these pathogens. In addition, swallowing training has been shown to improve the movement and function of swallowing-related muscles, also resulting in decreased incidence of pneumonia. These findings support the contention that oral care is effective in the prevention of AP.",

     "abstract": "As Taiwan has become the fastest aging country in the world, developing elderly-friendly health care services is of great importance. Compared with traditional health-care service models, healthcare needs of older people may differ extensively. It has been reported that geriatric evaluation and management (GEM), helps to differentiate the atypical presentations of frail older patients, to discover hidden health-social problems, and to promote long-term clinical outcome. The main purpose of this study was to explore the demographic characteristics of older patients visiting outpatient GEM service and its impact to health-care utilization in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan. From January to October of 2008, 1054 patients visited the outpatient GEM service, and comprehensive geriatric assessment was performed for 140 patients (62.9% males with the mean age was 81.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 years), and 34.8% of them were college graduates. Overall, the prevalence of functional impairment was 11.4%, depressive symptoms 20.7%, cognitive impairment 32.1%, and abnormal timed up-and-go test 32.1%. During the 12-month follow-up, items of mean oral medications were significantly reduced (3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.7 vs. 3.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the health-related quality of life was significantly improved (64.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.0 vs. 61.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In conclusion, patients visiting outpatient GEM services in Taiwan are old and well-educated, and they possessed various functional impairments. The outpatient GEM services significantly reduced the items of oral medications and improved quality of life. The possible better compliance of this cohort due to high educational status may overestimate the clinical effectiveness of outpatient GEM services. Further investigations are needed to clarify the long-term benefits of outpatient GEM services.",

The test subjects put one leg forward and returned it to its original position while matching varying metronome tempos (40\u00a0bpm, 60\u00a0bpm, and 120\u00a0bpm) for 10\u00a0s. As an evaluation parameter, the time difference between the metronome sound and the time when the subject's foot hits the ground was used. A significant time difference was found only in the group of elderly women. The time differences were greater in the 40\u00a0bpm and 120\u00a0bpm step tests than in the 60\u00a0bpm step test. The time variances showed significantly low correlations with gait time (r\u00a0=\u00a00.33\u20130.42). Since the SFS test purposefully produces balance instability via shifts in one's center of gravity through forward and backward movements, the elderly with inferior balancing ability as well as a diminished ability to walk might have difficulty succeeding in this test. In conclusion, the SFS test is deemed effective in evaluating elderly subjects\u2019 balancing ability.",

Psychological distress was assessed using the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) in 2004. The continuing participants were living in East Baltimore, Maryland in 1981.

Medical records from 45 consecutive admissions have been reviewed. A great proportion of patients had dementia with superimposed delirium. Compared to care in general aged care wards, there was no reduction in length of stay (LOS) of patients in this study, ostensibly due to the delayed placement for long-term care. However there was a marked reduction in fall incidence and lesser use of \u2018specials\u2019. Psychotropic medications (PMs) were frequently used but their indications were carefully reviewed. Upon discharge there was improvement in the behavioral profile of the patients. Questionnaires completed by carers and staff were used to further assess the efficacy of the unit. There was general satisfaction of the care provided in the unit whist a few areas have been identified that require further attention. This model of intervention presents an improvement to the quality of care for acutely ill elderly patients with behavioral problems.",

Cognitive functions were repeated until 36 months of follow-up using the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE) and the modified Mini-Mental State (3MS) test. We calculated the rate of cognitive decline (K-MMSE and 3MS score changes/month) and compared it between the two groups. The decreased BMI group showed lower level of cognitive function than that of stable BMI group, especially at the 36th month of follow-up (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, the rate of cognitive decline was also significantly faster in the decreased BMI group, particularly at the 36th month of follow-up (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

In this study, we investigate the associated factors of hyponatremia, and its association with anemia in the institutionalized elderly in Taiwan. A total of 414 participants aged 65 years and above were recruited from eight long-term care facilities in 2002\u20132003. Baseline characteristics, medical records, and biomarkers were obtained. Hyponatremia was defined as a serum Na-concentration\u00a0<\u00a0135\u00a0mmol/l. Relationships between hyponatremia and the demographic and laboratory characteristics were tested using multiple logistic and linear regression analyses. The prevalence of hyponatremia and anemia was 14.7% and 56.0%, respectively. Anemia, hypouricemia, and the placement of tubes (including nasogastric tube, tracheostomy tube, and Foley catheter) were significantly associated with hyponatremia after adjustment for potential confounders using multiple logistic regression analysis. The adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for these three factors were 3.28 (1.40\u20137.69), 4.98 (2.18\u201311.36), 9.15 (3.33\u201325.12), respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses also showed that serum Na concentration was significantly associated with hemoglobin, uric acid, and number of tubes. In conclusion, it was found that anemia, the placement of tubes, and hypouricemia were associated with hyponatremia in the institutionalized elderly.

Imaging diagnostics (ultrasound or CT), when considered alone, are also of little use for the purpose of clarifying thyroid gland function. We report here on a case of primary hypothyroidism that was diagnosed late because the correlated signs and symptoms (asthenia, bradycardia, pleural effusions, hyponatremia, worsening renal and respiratory insufficiency, hoarseness) had previously been attributed to the normal aging process and to the patient's other health conditions (Parkinson's disease, PD; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD). After a couple of weeks of treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine, there were clinical and laboratory evidences of an improvement in the patient's condition. She became more reactive, with a shriller voice. The pleural effusion disappeared, and so did the bradycardia. Laboratory tests showed normal sodium levels, and the renal insufficiency had improved. The lack of specificity of the clinical presentation of hypothyroidism in the elderly might justify the routine measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone in these patients.",

The relationship between AF and mortality during a 12-year follow-up in 125 subjects with CHF and in 1.143 subjects without CHF were studied.

For 99% of the patients, the prescription of HA was a renewal. Prescribers were mainly general practitioners (96.8%). Statins are the most widely prescribed HA even among very elderly subjects. However, after 80 years the prescription of HA, mainly statins, decreases with aging. This could be explained by polypathology, polypharmacy and the deterioration in metabolic functions which are markers of frailty.

A postal questionnaire answered by 2490 random older people (>75 years) included six questions concerning satisfaction with life, feeling needed, plans for future, zest for life, lack of feelings of depression and loneliness. The vital status was followed for 57 months. All-cause mortality rate was 19.1% and 30.3% among elderly with (22%) and without (78%) positive life orientation, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The difference in mortality increased over time. After controlling for age, gender, and subjective health, the protective value of positive life orientation remained significant (hazard ratio, HR\u00a0=\u00a00.78, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.63\u20130.98, p\u00a0<\u00a00.03). Feeling needed was the strongest independent predictor (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.72, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A six-question life orientation identifies old people at risk. Positive life orientation predicts good survival prognosis independently of subjective health.",

     "abstract": "The unexpected return of mental clarity and memory shortly before death in patients suffering from severe psychiatric and neurologic disorders, which we have called \u201cterminal lucidity\u201d, has been reported in the medical literature over the past 250 years, but has received little attention. We review a range of terminal lucidity cases in order to encourage investigation of the mechanisms involved and possible insights into both the neuroscience of memory and cognition at the end of life and treatment of terminal illness. These examples include case reports of patients suffering from brain abscesses, tumors, strokes, meningitis, dementia or Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and affective disorders. Several of these accounts suggest that during terminal lucidity, memory and cognitive abilities may function by neurologic processes different from those of the normal brain. We expect that significant contributions to better understanding the processes involved in memory and cognition processing might be gained through in-depth studies of terminal lucidity. Studying terminal lucidity might also facilitate the development of novel therapies. In addition, increased awareness of unusual end-of-life experiences could help physicians, caregivers, and bereaved family members be prepared for encountering such experiences, and help those individuals cope with them.",

The aim of this study was to explore the difference in clinical presentation in acute, uncomplicated UTI in otherwise healthy community dwelling, premenopausal (Pre-M) and postmenopausal (Post-M) women. A UTI was defined as uropathogen of more than 103\u00a0cfu/ml in midstream urine culture. Symptoms of UTI were divided to three: during voiding, local symptoms, and generalized symptoms. A total of 196 women aged a minimum of 45 years with diagnosis of UTI were studied. The patients were divided into two groups: Pre-M (n\u00a0=\u00a0102, mean age 48.14 years) and Post-M (n\u00a0=\u00a094, mean age 69.21 years). The predominant complaints in Pre-M women were local symptoms. The clinical presentations showed more severity in the Post-M group than in Pre-M women, predominantly generalized unspecific symptoms and storage symptoms. Advanced age positively correlated with urgency of urination, painful voiding, urinary incontinence, sexual activity, low-back pain, lower abdominal pain and negatively correlated with frequency, painful and burning of urination and bladder pain. Our study showed that clinical presentation of UTI in Pre-M and Post-M women is different. The differences are presented not only by the voiding itself and by local symptoms but also by unspecified generalized symptoms that is especially important in elderly patients.",

     "abstract": "Older people tend to have multiple comorbid conditions and subsequent polypharmacy, which place them at higher risk of adverse drug events, drug\u2013drug and drug\u2013disease interactions and IP. IP includes several patterns, such as inappropriate dose or duration, prescribing drugs having significant drug\u2013disease or drug\u2013drug interactions, and the omission of potentially beneficial medications. The main purpose was to evaluate the prevalence of IP among medical inpatients in a medical center, so to evaluate the associative factors of IP in Taiwan. From January to December of 2009, all patients aged 65 years and older who were discharged from the medical wards of Taipei Veterans General Hospital were randomly sampled for study (the sampling rate around 1.0%). The IP was evaluated by the STOPP and START criteria. Each medical record was carefully reviewed by physicians who had been trained. Overall, 520 records of elderly medical ward inpatients (mean age\u00a0=\u00a079.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7 years, 73.8% males) were included for study. In total, 3455 items of medication were prescribed for these 520 patients (mean\u00a0=\u00a06.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2 items). According to STOPP criteria, 36.2% of the study subjects had at least one potentially inappropriate medication (PIM). The most common PIMs were: (1) medications that may adversely affect those who are prone to falls, e.g., benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and first generation antihistamines (14.2%). (2) Ca-channel blockers with chronic constipation (12.3%). (3) Use of neuroleptic agents (5.6%). (4) Long-term, long-acting benzodiazepines (2.5%). (5) Prolonged use of first generation antihistamines (2.1%). Besides, 218 patients (41.9%) had at least one potentially prescribing omission (PPO). Common PPOs included: (1) statin therapy in diabetes mellitus if coexisting major cardiovascular risk factors present (19.0%). (2) Antiplatelet therapy in diabetes mellitus with co-existing major cardiovascular risk factors (12.5%). (3) Metformin with type 2 diabetes with or without metabolic syndrome (in the absence of renal impairment) (8.7%). (4) Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blockers with chronic heart failure (7.3%). (5) Aspirin or clopidogrel with a documented history of atherosclerotic coronary, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease in patients with sinus rhythm (7.1%). Logistic regression showed that older age and number of medications were significant risk factors for PIMs. In conclusion, the prevalence of PIMs among elderly medical inpatients in a medical center in Taiwan was 36.2% and PPOs was 41.9%. Further study is needed to clarify the underlying causes of potentially IP to promote better quality of prescribing for older patients.",

It has been reported that older age per se is a poor prognostic factor of SAB, but little is known whether poor clinical outcomes is related to conservative attitudes of treating physicians. A retrospective cohort of 126 patients (mean age: 73.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.6\u00a0years, 72.2% males) with community-onset SAB during 2004\u20132008 in a tertiary medical center in Taiwan was obtained for study. Demographic data, clinical characteristics, primary infectious focus, metastatic lesions, access to critical care units, performance of invasive procedures, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and in-hospital mortality for all study subjects were collected. The overall in-hospital mortality was 32.5%, which was not significantly different between adult and elderly groups. SAB of elderly patients was more likely to be primary than that of the adult patients (20.4% vs. 3.6%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.043). Deep-seated abscess, osteomyelitis and metastatic lesion with central nervous system (CNS) involvement were more common infection foci in the adult patient group. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cerebrovascular accident were more common underlying conditions of the elderly group. Chances of patients admitted to intensive care unit and employment of invasive procedures were not different between groups although elderly patients were supposed to be of a greater risk of mortality. In conclusion, the overall in-hospital mortality of community-onset SAB was 32.5%, which was not different between age groups. In general, older patients were of similar chance to receive critical care and invasive procedures except arterial line and non-tunneled central venous catheters. Further prospective investigation is needed to clarify whether physicians hold different attitudes to older patients with SAB and the differences in treatment attitude resulting in poorer clinical outcomes.",

The dominant group was persons with secondary education (65.9%), and higher education (28.2%) as well as married (54.5%). All of the subjects included in the study were fully mobile. The study was conducted based on authors\u2019 original questionnaire which consisted of 24 questions and a basic personal data form surveying age, gender, marital status, level of education as well as self-reported illnesses and health problems. The research assumed the majority of positive responses as the sign of happy aging and experiencing one's own old age. Positive correlation was observed between the statement that human beings influence quality and shape of their lives, and therefore they are responsible for their own life. The higher the level of fulfilling aims in life the more frequently elderly age was perceived as a happy period. In the research data there was a relationship observed between levels of education and discrimination, i.e., the higher level of education the fewer cases of discrimination experienced: \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a012.992 (df\u00a0=\u00a02; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

As a result of examination with Tukey's test of additivity, it was seen that items of the scale have additive quality (F\u00a0=\u00a085.25, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). When we calculated the correlation of each item with total score, it was found that correlation coefficient varied between 0.32 and 0.68. Test\u2013retest reliability was defined by use of Pearson correlation analysis. It was determined that test\u2013retest consistency of correlation scale between two measurements was r\u00a0=\u00a00.51. As a result of test\u2013retest application, the correlation between the first and second application scores of each item was analyzed to determine the internal consistency of each item of the scale. Based on this analysis it was found as p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 between r\u00a0=\u00a00.22 and 0.65. As a conclusion, Turkish validity and reliability of UCLA-GA scale was demonstrated in this study. Since Turkish version of UCLA-GA scale is short and clear, it is recommended to use it for determining attitudes of health care providers toward elderly in geriatrics.",

The data used herein were from five waves of a longitudinal study conducted from 1993 to 2007. Those who completed at least three waves were included in the analysis, for a total of 2584 participants. A group-based trajectory model was used to analyze the data. Time-constant variables and time-varying covariates were used as the moderators of changes in life satisfaction trajectories. Four life satisfaction trajectories were identified: low (21.8%), middle (39.7%), increasing (25.9%), and high-declining (12.5%). Having more education and better physical and psychological health, social support, and economic satisfaction were predictors of a higher life satisfaction trajectory, and maintaining good physical and emotional health, having a spouse, and having better economic satisfaction were associated with an increase in life satisfaction over time.",

To maintain LLMS the question arises whether habitual physical activities (HPA) can prevent a decline in LLMS. This review aims to determine the relationship between HPA throughout life and LLMS above age 50. Using relevant databases and keywords, 70 studies that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed and where possible, a meta-analysis was performed. The main findings are: (1) the present level of HPA is positively related to LLMS; (2) HPA in the past has little effect on present LLMS; (3) HPA involving endurance have less influence on LLMS compared to HPA involving strength; (4) people with a stable habitually physically active life are able to delay a decline in LLMS. In conclusion, to obtain a high amount of LLMS during aging, it is important to achieve and maintain a high level of HPA with mainly muscle-strengthening activities.",

On the other hand, BDNF has been related to neuroprotection in a series of central nervous system diseases in older age. The levels of BDNF in groups of elderly women classified according to Fried phenotype (non-frail and pre-frail) were compared. We assessed the impact of a PTI on BDNF levels. A convenience sample of 48 elderly women was randomly selected. The PTI group was composed by 20 elderly women selected from this group. Plasma neurotrophic factors, such as BDNF, glial-derived neutrophic factor (GDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Timed-up-and-go (TUG) test, hand-grip and work/body weight were evaluated before and after the intervention. Plasma concentrations of BDNF were significantly higher in non-frail in comparison to pre-frail elderly women. After the PTI, higher levels of BDNF were found in elderly women (before 351\u00a0\u00b1\u00a068\u00a0pg/ml and after 593\u00a0\u00b1\u00a079\u00a0pg/ml; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Both groups had an increase in BDNF levels after the PTI. The low levels of BDNF in pre-frail elderly women suggest that this neurotrophic factor may be a key pathophysiological mediator in the syndrome of frailty. The fact that PTI increased BDNF levels in both groups suggests that it may be possible to modify this phenotype.",

We examined demographic, health, and behavioral risk factors for falls and fall-related injuries in adults 65 years and older, with a particular focus on adults 85 years and older. We analyzed self-reported information from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for 2008. Data was available for 120,923 people aged 65 or older and 12,684 people aged 85 or older. Of those aged 85 or older, 21.3% reported at least one fall in the past 3 months and 7.2% reported at least one fall related injury requiring medical care or limiting activity for a day or longer. Below average general health, male sex, perceived insufficient sleep, health problems requiring assistive devices, alcohol consumption, increasing body mass index and history of stroke were all independently associated with a greater risk of falls or fall related injuries. The greater risk of falling in those 85 years and older appeared to be due to the deterioration of overall health status with age; among those with excellent overall health status, there was no greater risk of falling in adults 85 years and older compared to those 65\u201384 years of age.

The relative contributions of dynamic balance, balance confidence and fear of falling to SET, was investigated in older adults. Thirty-three community-dwelling older adults completed tests of SET as well as the FTSST, a test of motor performance associated with dynamic balance. Psychological indicators of balance-related confidence assessed were the ABC 6-item scale (ABC-6) and fear of falling. Mean SET was significantly slower in the fear of falling group than in the no fear of falling group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Correlational analysis indicated that poorer performance on the FTSST and lower balance confidence, were associated with slower time to execute a rapid step. A stepwise multiple regression model including the FTSST, ABC-6 score, and fear of falling as predictor variables, explained 58% of the variance in SET (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The FTSST explained the largest proportion of the variance in SET (36%), followed by fear of falling (15%) and ABC-6 score (7%). These data show that the FTSST, ABC-6 score and fear of falling are significant and independent predictors of SET in older adults. Dynamic balance, balance confidence and fear of falling, may play important roles in executing rapid steps in older adults. Motor performance and psychological indicators of balance-related confidence appear to have crucial roles in SET in older adults.",

This study aimed to elucidate the association of the SPPB with the pulmonary function test (PFT) to determine the usefulness of the SPPB as a predictor of PFT decline. The SPPB and PFT were performed on random sample nested in the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (KLoSA) panel, a national representative sample of aging people in Korea. Comparisons of adjusted means of forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced expiratory ratio (FER) defined as FEV1/FVC between normal and abnormal SPPB groups were performed using the t-test. The association between PFT and SPPB abnormality was examined using multiple logistic regression analysis. Additionally, the associations of gait speed and chair stand time with FEV1 and FVC were examined using multiple linear regression analysis. Five hundred and eighteen subjects were included in analysis. Approximately 43% (222/518) of the subjects were male and 65% (338/518) were 60 years or older. Adjusted means of FEV1 and FER were significantly or marginally lower when SPPB score was abnormal in both overall and non-smoking men (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009 and 0.053 for overall, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.080 for non-smokers), but FVC was lower only in non-smoking men (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024).

     "abstract": "Aging is characterized by a progressive alteration of homeostatic mechanisms modulated by environmental and genetic factors. It is associated with a pro-inflammatory status. In centenarians, an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokine production balanced by anti-inflammatory immune response that would promote longevity is observed. Cytokine dysregulation is believed to play a key role in the proposed remodeling of the immune-inflammatory responses accompanying old age. IL-22 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine belonging to the IL-10 family and represents an important effector molecule of activated T helper (Th)-22, Th-1, and Th-17 cells. We recruited 17 healthy centenarians (4 males, 13 females, range 100\u2013105 years). All ultralongeval subjects were living at home or in a nursing home. Sixteen healthy, sex-matched individuals (4 males, 12 females, range 60\u201395 years) were also recruited as controls. Centenarians displayed significantly higher circulating IL-22 levels compared to control population (45.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a066.9\u00a0pg/ml versus 11.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.5\u00a0pg/ml; p\u00a0=\u00a00.031). It's well known that IL-22 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine produced by activated T lymphocytes and NK cells. IL-22 stimulates the production of acute phase reactants and promotes the antimicrobial defense. The results of the present study show, for the first time, that there is an increase of IL-22 in healthy centenarians. This pro-inflammatory condition probably is protective against infection, promoting the longevity of these subjects.",

Frailty was operationalized using four criteria: low body mass index (BMI), low level of physical activity, and dissatisfaction with both muscle strength and endurance.Frailty constituted a single entity, different from physical limitation and co-morbidity. Compared with robust individuals, frail persons were older, had more chronic diseases, higher levels of disability and physical function decline. Pre-frail individuals had an intermediate distribution. Those people classified as either frail or pre-frail had higher frequency of hospitalization, and a higher probability of co-morbidity than robust. Frailty was also associated with higher mortality.Our screening tool for frailty was able to evidence important characteristics of this syndrome, i.e., it is a single entity with grades of severity which are associated with health problems. Detecting and categorizing frailty may lead to early therapeutic interventions to combat this condition.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: Although international research in recent years has often focused on elder abuse, its extent is not clear in community-based settings and even bigger mystery in nursing homes. Background: Until now in the literature it has in most cases only been assumed that nursing homes offer better protection from abuse for frail older people. Methods: A cross-sectional research design was applied by use of structured interviews. Those involved were frail older people (n\u00a0=\u00a0300) who were in need of some sort of professional nursing assistance. Results: Nursing home accommodation was extracted as the strongest predictor, significantly reducing the risk of physical abuse (odds ratio, OR 0.1, 95% confidence interval, 95% CI 0.0\u20130.3) and financial abuse (OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1\u20130.4). Spouses and sons were revealed as the most regular perpetrators of physical and financial abuse. The results showed no statistical significance between settings as predictors of the occurrence of mental abuse (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.5\u20131.6). Discussion: Results of the statistical analysis add to the general assumption that nursing home accommodation offers protection for frail older people in escaping physical and financial abuse. Conclusion: In their clinical practice, community nurses should give special attention to frail older people who, besides their healthcare needs, are also heavily dependent in the activities of daily living (ADLs). In order to combat elder abuse, conditions in the family should be regularly verified.",

The study involved 17 elderly men (68.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.9 years of age, ranging between 65 and 74 years). Mean velocity of the center of pressure (COP) displacements was measured using a force plate both before and after fatigue induced by a cycle ergometer exercise. Following physical exercise, the mean velocity of the COP and its components, both in the sagittal and frontal plane, increased significantly. It was found that increasing BMI was associated with increasing exercise-induced changes in the mean velocity of the frontal plane. Additionally, BL level was positively correlated with changes in the mean velocity of the sagittal plane. Higher post-exercise values of the mean velocity of the COP may suggest a temporary increase in the risk of falls. Therefore, it seems advisable to caution the elderly men in regards to the increased risk of falling following exercise. Analysis showed that the changes in the PC as indicated by the increase in the COP displacements velocity may be related to the level of fatigue (as indicated by BL). Moreover, elderly men possessing a higher BMI may exhibit a tendency toward the greater increase in the postural sway after exercise-induced fatigue.",

Therefore the aim was to investigate whether a multidisciplinary postoperative intervention program could reduce postoperative complications and improve functional recovery among people with dementia. Methods: A randomized controlled trial with subgroup analyses among patients with dementia. Sixty-four patients with femoral neck fracture, aged \u226570 years at Ume\u00e5 University Hospital, Sweden. The intervention consisted of staff education, individualized care planning and rehabilitation, active prevention, detection and treatment of postoperative complications, especially delirium. The staff worked in teams to apply comprehensive geriatric assessment, management and rehabilitation, including a follow-up at 4 months postoperatively. The control group followed conventional postoperative routines. Results: There were fewer postoperative complications in the intervention group such as urinary tract infections, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001; nutritional problems, p\u00a0=\u00a00.025; postoperative delirium, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002; falls, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006.

The primary outcome was change in functional capacity score from HHC admission to HHC discharge.Over the course of the episode (M\u00a0=\u00a044 days), most (70%) patients improved, 15.6% stayed the same, and 14.4% declined in activities of daily living (ADL) scores.

SRH status may interact with certain factors and change over a person's lifetime. In this study, we sought to characterize profiles of older people over time by constructing prototypical trajectories of the variable of interest, namely SRH. The underlying assumption was that the collection of observed individual trajectories could be efficiently summarized by a smaller set of latent clusters of those trajectories. Data was obtained from the Longitudinal Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan, which was conducted between 1989 and 2003 and included five separate waves of survey. A total of 3937 subjects aged 60 or older (2251 males and 1686 females) comprised the major analytic cohort. Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) was used to identify developmental classes of trajectory patterns in SRH. The results showed that during a 14-year period, SRH developed five major longitudinal trajectories. Less than one-third of the older population was able to maintain their formerly good or moderate health status; when change occurred, decline was more likely than improvement. In addition, LCGA indicated that many demographic characteristics, as well as physical and psychological propensities, were associated with poor SRH in the older population. Specifically, these factors played a role in involving baseline SRH level and its trend toward deterioration in later life. Health care professionals must understand the various longitudinal patterns and factors affecting SRH trajectories if they are to develop programs aimed at maintaining the older population's health and well-being.",

Extensive literature has identified multiple determinants of SRH in different populations. However, such studies on centenarians are scarce and parsimonious. Our objective is to identify SRH determinants in centenarians. This is a nationwide cross-sectional study on 400 Greek centenarians that was carried out between 2007 and 2010. SRH was evaluated by a simple question with a 5-point scale. Three categories of SRH were formed (very good/good/poor), which served as the dependent variable in multinomial regression models. Various sociodemographic, disease-related, lifestyle and psychosocial variables were assessed as candidate determinants of SRH. According to our results, SRH ratings among centenarians were better than that expected according to previous studies showing worse SRH ratings with increasing age in Greece. The 22.4% of the variance in SRH among centenarians was predicted by gender, habitat region and status, financial problems, disease presence and autonomy. Among lifestyle and psychosocial variables, obesity, good relationships with children, lack of feelings of loneliness, high optimism, adaptability and an internal health locus of control profile were independently associated with good SRH. These results indicate that SRH in individuals of extreme longevity were related to specific personal psychosocial factors that contribute to healthy aging and thus support the biopsychosocial model of health promotion.",

ADL-dependent subjects and those at risk of depression had significant more hospital stays, except for those at/not at risk of depression in years 2, 4 and 5. The healthcare utilization predictors 5\u20136 years after baseline were mainly age, previous healthcare utilization and various symptoms and, in 1\u20132 and 3\u20134 years after baseline, age, various diagnostic groups and various physical variables. Thus healthcare utilization patterns seem to be similar for the different groups, but it is difficult to find universal predictors. This suggests that different variables should be considered, including both ADL and psychosocial variables, when trying to identify future healthcare users.",

Data from the Italian Hospital-Discharge Registries (HDRs) of the years 1996, 2001, and 2006 have been analyzed in order to assess the variations among the elderly in terms of hospitalization rates, hospital stay, and bed rates. The results were compared with nursing home admission rates and home care offer. Relations among these variables were explored by univariate and multivariate analyses. Elderly hospital admission rates decreased in Italy from 324.2/1000 in 1996, to 258.7 in 2006. Mean hospital stay of elderly patients was 9.4 days in 2006, 9.5 in 2001 and 10.1 in 1996. A multivariate linear regression model was statistically significant in explaining the variations in hospitalization rates (F: 5.68; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004; R2\u00a0=\u00a00.77). The main determinants linked to such variations were the bed rate (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.67; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and the hospital length of stay (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.77; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). The analysis showed a reduction in hospitalization rates among the elderly, which was not counterbalanced by an increased offer of home care and/or nursing home services, but was mainly linked to a decrease in the supply of acute beds, with possible consequences on the quality of health care.",

However, it is unclear how the HCSCs are operated because statistical data regarding their activities have not been disclosed to the Japanese public. The purpose of this study was to describe the trends associated with the HCSC activity in Tokyo, Japan. Methods: We submitted an application to the relevant government ministry to disclose the annual activity reports from 2008 to 2010 of the HCSCs located in Tokyo. Reports from each HCSC contained information on the number of patients, the number of deceased patients, their place of death and the number of home visits by physicians and nurses. Results: The number of HCSC activity reports for each year was 1166 (2008), 1209 (2009) and 1246 (2010), while the total number of patients for each year was 67,765 (2008), 67,094 (2009) and 83,486 (2010). Patients who died at home each year under the care of HCSCs was 4431 (2008), 4786 (2009) and 5234 (2010). It is of note that in 2010 about 87% of patients were cared by HCSCs that cared for >50 patients a year and as many as 26.9% of patients who died at home utilized clinics that cared for >50 deceased patients a year. Conclusion: The advent of HCSCs caring yearly for >50 patients and deceased patients has led to a shift in the location in which patients receive end-of-life care.",

Comorbidity indexes do not capture severity of illness or healthcare utilization; however, inflammation biomarkers that are not disease-specific may predict hospitalization and death in older adults. We sought to predict hospitalization and mortality of older adults using inflammation biomarkers. From a prospective, observational study, 370 community-dwelling adults 65 years or older from central Alabama participated in an in-home assessment and provided fasting blood samples for inflammation biomarker testing in 2004. We calculated an inflammation summary score (range 0\u20134), one point each for low albumin, high C-reactive protein, low cholesterol, and high interleukin-6. Utilizing Cox proportional hazards models, inflammation summary scores were used to predicted time to hospitalization and death during a 4-year follow up period. The mean age was 73.7 (\u00b15.9 yrs), and 53 (14%) participants had summary scores of 3 or 4. The rates of dying were significantly increased for participants with inflammation summary scores of 2, 3, or 4 (hazard ratio (HR) 2.22, 2.78, and 7.55, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). An inflammation summary score of 4 significantly predicted hospitalization (HR 5.92, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Community-dwelling older adults with biomarkers positive for inflammation had increased rates of being hospitalized or dying during the follow up period. Assessment of the individual contribution of particular inflammation biomarkers in the prediction of health outcomes in older populations and the development of validated summary scores to predict morbidity and mortality are needed.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between CRP and medical-care expenditures in a community-dwelling elderly population. This prospective cohort study was conducted including 925 Japanese subjects aged \u226570 years. A high-sensitivity CRP assay was used by applying the nephelometric method. Hospitalizations, outpatient visits, and expenditures were ascertained through computerized linkage with claims lodged between August 2002 and March 2008 with the Miyagi National Health Insurance (NHI) Association. Since medical-care expenditures were not normally distributed, the category of high medical-care expenditures (>75th percentile of medical-care expenditures: inpatient expenditures >$494/month; outpatient expenditure >$522/month; total expenditures >$1103/month) was used to examine the relation of CRP levels with medical-care expenditures. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between CRP cutoff points (low concentrations: <1.0\u00a0mg/L; intermediate concentrations: 1.0\u20133.0\u00a0mg/L; or high concentrations: \u22653.0\u00a0mg/L) and medical-care expenditures during 6 year-follow up period. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, a positive association of CRP with hospitalization, and total expenditures (p for trend\u00a0=\u00a00.03 and 0.02, respectively) was found. An elevated baseline CRP level is an independent predictor of increases in prospective medical-care expenditures among community-dwelling elderly.

CVDRFs were obtained from a combination of self-report medical history and blood-based biomarkers. Three CVDRF groups (\u22641, 2, and \u22653 CVDRFs) were identified. More CVDRFs were significantly associated with higher levels of inflammatory markers in both age groups, and associated with lower levels of executive function (EF) in the old age group. CVDRFs were not related to the frequency of leisure activities in either age group. After controlling for covariates, higher levels of physical activities were significantly associated with lower levels of inflammatory markers, and higher levels of mental activities were associated with higher levels of cognitive function. In the old age group, physical activities also moderated the effect of CVDRFs on episodic memory (EM), and mental activities moderated the effect of CVDRFs on interleukin-6 (IL-6). Multiple CVDRFs may be associated with poorer cognitive function and higher inflammatory markers, but middle-age and older adults with CVDRFs may not engage in frequent physical and cognitive activities that may be protective. It is important to develop strategies to facilitate engagement in these activities from midlife.",

The prevalence of anemia, elevated serum parathyroid hormone (PTH), high serum phosphorus and low uncorrected serum calcium was analyzed in relation to GFR estimated by three serum creatinine-based equations and one cystatin C-based equation.567 patients aged 80 and over were included (63% women). The prevalence of anemia, elevated PTH and high phosphorus showed an inverse relationship with eGFR. This relationship remained after logistic regression analysis adjusting for demographics and co-morbidity. No such relationship between low calcium and eGFR was found. Using an eGFR of 60\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2 modification of diet in renal disease equation (MDRD) as screening threshold for metabolic complications would result in a high incidence of missed complications: 29%, 28% and 40% for anemia, elevated PTH and high phosphorus, respectively.The presence of anemia, an elevated PTH or an elevated serum phosphorus level increased with lower eGFR but even among patients with an eGFR >60\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2, these complications are common.

Calf mass index (CMI) (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.488, 95% CI; 0.32\u20130.743, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and alpha-blockers (\u00a0=\u00a00.078, 95% CI; 0.007\u20130.883, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) were related to OH. The area under the ROC curve was 74.4% (95% CI; 62.8\u201386.0, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and the discriminatory CMI value was 21.2. Our findings suggest that the CMI can be used for screening for OH in the community-dwelling elderly. This information can help clinicians and health care providers working with older people to identify those at risk of OH.",

Here we asked whether also erroneous identifications of visual objects subsequently corrected and replaced by a correct identification might induce false recognitions, and whether this is more likely to occur in older people. For this aim a new paradigm was developed. In the first phase, participants performed a visual object identification task with degraded pictures of objects and produced correct and false but subsequently corrected identifications. In the second phase, participants performed a surprise recognition task in which also false identifications were presented. False identifications elicited false recognitions, with a stronger and more reliable effect in elderly participants, suggesting that correcting the initial visual error is not sufficient to correct the memory for the experience. Moreover, misidentification-related false recognitions coexisted in memory along with correct recognitions of correct identifications. These findings are discussed in relation with age-related deficits in memory updating and strategic retrieval.",

We assessed the Korean Dementia Screening Questionnaire (KDSQ) and Seoul Instrumental activities of Daily Living (S-IADL) of 344 subjects with SCI and 697 with MCI. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted after adjusting for age, sex, and educational status. Common and rare symptoms were similar between the SCI and MCI groups. The most distinguishing features of KDSQ were \u2018Finds it hard to go somewhere on his/her own using public transportation\u2019 (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a0OR\u00a0=\u00a04.56, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), \u2018Has difficulty in operating appliances\u2019 (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.47, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and \u2018Keeps repeating the same question\u2019 (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.03, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

The study was conducted, using the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), and the NHANES 1999\u20132002 data, on women aged 35\u201360. Subjects who had not had surgical menopause, did not use contraceptives, did not smoke, and did not breastfeed during the examination, and did not use contraception and for whom follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (LH) activity was assessed, were included in the study. Menopausal status was defined by months since the last period (<2, 2\u201312, and >12 months for pre-, peri-, and postmenopause, respectively). The results indicate that postmenopausal women, aged less than 45, are characterized by a decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP), an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, and a decrease in triglyceride (TG) levels. It was also determined that aging is the main factor leading to physiological variability in systolic blood pressure and high density lipoprotein levels, in pre- and perimenopausal women, and in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) activity in peri- and postmenopausal women.",

     "abstract": "SAMP8 mice show spontaneously accelerated aging and a short life span with systemic accumulation of oxidative stress. Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus upon oxidative stress and induces the expression of detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes. Recently, several studies reported that Nrf2 is associated with aging and various diseases. In the present study, we investigated the levels of Nrf2 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 in livers of SAMP8 and normal aging SAMR1 mice. The protein level of Nrf2 in the nucleus of the liver was significantly decreased in SAMP8 at 10 months old compared with that in age-matched SAMR1. The protein level of Keap1, which anchors Nrf2 in the cytoplasm, did not differ between SAMP8 and SAMR1. In addition, the mRNA expression of Nrf2 in the liver of SAMP8 was significantly lower than that of SAMR1. Moreover, mRNA levels of detoxification and antioxidant enzymes, GSTa1 and NQO1, were significantly decreased in SAMP8 compared with SAMR1. These results indicate that a higher level of oxidative stress in SAMP8 might be caused by a lower level of Nrf2. Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 was significantly decreased in the liver of SAMP8 at 10 months old. Recent studies have suggested that the Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 signaling pathway is involved in the nuclear translocation of Nrf2. Therefore, it is suggested that the reduction of the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus might be induced by a decrease of GSK-3\u03b2 phosphorylation, resulting in an increase of oxidative stress in SAMP8 mice.",

The following data were determined for all the volunteers: alimentary frequency by clinical dieticians; genotyping of the G145C polymorphism in the TAS2r38 gene; cognitive status; sensorial (visual and hearing) acuity and drugs related to ageusia or dysgeusia. Sensitivity to bitter taste was assessed using phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) in a subset. Non-parametric tests confirmed the remarkable effect of the C allele in determining sensitivity to PTC (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Then, it was clarified how this cellular senescence phenomenon is associated with oxidative stress effect induced by LPS and whether antioxidants could inhibit reduced cellular viability by oxidant stress effect of LPS. In cell viability using cell counting kit-8, exposure to LPS decreased cellular viability and induced growth arrest in a concentration-dependent manner. The pre-apoptotic concentration of LPS was determined by caspase activation using a Caspase-Glo 3/7 luminescence assay kit. This concentration of LPS caused morphologic characteristics shown in senescent cells and elevated senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity. In addition, lysosomal content associated with senescence was increased by LPS at the pre-apoptotic concentration. However, this concentration of LPS did not shorten the telomere length. Exposure to LPS resulted in the formation of hydrogen peroxide in a concentration-dependent manner. The ability of LPS to reduce cellular viability was inhibited by the presence of glutathione. This study revealed that LPS could induce cellular senescence in lung alveloar epithelial cells, and these phenomena were closely associated with hydrogen peroxide production by LPS. Taken together, it is suggested that LPS-induced cellular senescence may play an important role in limiting the tissue repair response after sepsis.",

Disability information from population surveys are often very crude as compared to information used on the clinical field. This study aimed to verify the concurrent validity of a survey questionnaire version of a disability instrument (SMAF) administered by lay interviewers, compared to the original SMAF rating scale completed by clinicians. Methods: The survey questionnaire version was developed by a panel of experts and pretested with 15 patients attending a day hospital program using a think-aloud approach. A social worker administered the SMAF rating scale at home to a sample of Community-dwelling frail people over 81 years old who participated in the PRISMA longitudinal study in Sherbrooke, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. The same subjects were contacted one month later by a lay interviewer, who completed the survey questionnaire. The two versions were compared using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and weighted kappas (WK). Results: 96 subjects participated in the study. The ICC was 0.82 for the total SMAF score and ranged from 0.46 (mental functions) to 0.82 (IADL) for the subscores. The questionnaire version systematically underestimated disability by 4.7 points on average (out of 87) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). For the case-mix classification generated from the disability assessment (Iso-SMAF profiles), the underestimation was even more striking.

The study included 54 patients with idiopathic PD who were distributed into two groups according to PD severity: unilateral group (n\u00a0=\u00a035); and bilateral group (n\u00a0=\u00a019). All patients underwent psychiatric assessment by means of the Hoehn and Yahr (HY) staging of PD, the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A and HADS-D, respectively), and The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The physical fitness components of functional capacity were evaluated over a 2-day period, using recommendations by the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance, and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). Pearson correlation coefficients and multiple regressions were calculated to test the correlation between functional capacity and clinical characteristics, and to predict clinical scores from physical performance, respectively. Clinical variables and physical component data were compared between groups using analysis of variance to determine the effects of disease severity. Patients with advanced disease showed low levels of functional capacity. Interestingly, patients with good functional capacity in one of the physical fitness components also showed good capacities in the other components. Disease severity is a major factor affecting functional capacity and clinical characteristics. Medical providers should take disease severity into consideration when prescribing physical activity for PD patients, since the relationship between functional capacity and clinical characteristics is dependent on disease severity.",

The prevalence of inadequate functional ability was of 16.2% (95% CI: 13\u201319%) in the sample analyzed. With aging, there was a significant trend of inadequate functional ability increasing in men (\u03c72 for trend\u00a0=\u00a08.481; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and women (\u03c72 trend\u00a0=\u00a013.667; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Factors positively associated with inadequate functional ability were age over 80 years, low monthly income, poor self-health perception, history of hospitalization in the last year, use of 5 or more medicines in the last 15 days; history of depression, history of osteoporosis, and negatively associated to physical activity. Factors associated with inadequate functional ability highlighted in this study demonstrate the importance of health programs in Brazil focused on adults and the elderly in preventing or delaying functional decline and promote healthy aging.",

This study is part of a multicenter project on Frailty in Elderly Brazilians (REDE FIBRA). Aims: To investigate characteristics, prevalence and associated factors related to frailty. Methodology: A total of 391 randomly selected elderly patients aged 65 years were interviewed. Data collection was performed using a multidimensional questionnaire containing information about sociodemographic and clinical variables. Fried's phenotype was used to characterize the frail elderly. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, bivariate analysis (\u03c72) and binary logistic regression. Results: The prevalence of frailty was 17.1%. In the final multivariate analysis model, the following factors associated with frailty were obtained: advanced chronological age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), presence of comorbidity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.035), dependence in basic (p\u00a0<\u00a00.010) and instrumental (p\u00a0<\u00a00.003) activities of daily living and negative perception of health status (p\u00a0<\u00a00030).

The present study was designed to identify factors leading HR older individuals to an impaired stepping performance in terms of frequency of maladaptive turning behavior (spin turn) and spatio-temporal patterns of fixations. Eleven HR (80.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6 years), 26 low-risk (LR) (77.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.7 years) older individuals, and 20 younger individuals performed the MTST. For the MTST, stepping accuracy was measured with two types of failure (stepping target and avoiding distracters). The frequency of a spin turn (i.e., a crossover step) was compared among the groups. The location and duration of each fixation were also compared. The HR older and younger participants showed a higher rate of spin turns. Whereas the younger participants fixated approximately three steps ahead, the older participants directed their fixation closer toward the imminent footfall target, demonstrating their difficulty to use the visual information regarding the target in a feedforward manner. Such patterns of fixations were significantly associated with the frequency of stepping and avoidance failures. The higher rate of stepping and avoidance failures in the MTST were attributed to maladaptive turning behavior, which is potentially destabilizing, and the tendency to fixate on/around an imminent footfall target, which prevented older individuals from considering the locations of future footfall targets.",

Improving mortality rates after this injury is an important part of medical management for the elderly. This study assessed mortality rates after hip fracture in patients aged \u226590 years and examined factors that contribute to mortality.Between April 2003 and March 2009, 186 patients aged \u226565 years were studied. Of these, 50 patients were aged \u226590 years. Walking ability before injury and at discharge, preoperative physical status, number of comorbidities, postoperative survival, sex, fracture type, and patients\u2019 residential status were investigated.One-year mortality was higher in patients aged \u226590 years (24%) than in younger patients (10%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Moreover, older patients were less likely to retain walking ability at discharge, and poor postoperative ambulatory levels were associated with increased mortality. Preoperative physical status according to the grading system of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) did not differ between the two age groups. Poor ASA grade was associated with mortality in the entire population, but this association was not significant in the older group. Although older patients had a higher number of trochanteric fractures, fracture type and mortality did not significantly correlate with age.Acceptable outcomes of hip fracture surgery can be achieved in very old patients. In addition, postoperative ambulatory level may be a predictor of mortality.",

MPV is a simple indicator of platelet size and has been known to be a marker of platelet activity. MPV is now considered a link between inflammation and thrombosis in multiple cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disorders including hypertension, peripheral artery disease, and stroke. This cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the association between MPV and leukoaraiosis for 223 healthy elderly subjects (142 men, 81 women; mean age 66.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 years) in a health examination program including brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.

To the best of our knowledge, however, there have been no studies investigating the topography of cortical thinning areas and correlations with HA using surface based morphometry of three-dimensional (3D) T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. Cortical thickness was measured using SBM, and hippocampal volume was measured using an automated method, in 219 patients with AD and 54 subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI). A partial correlation model was used in analysis of cortical thinning related to HA. Cortical thinning areas related to HA were found mostly within areas associated with polysynaptic or direct pathways of the hippocampus, a finding consistent with the disconnection hypothesis. Therefore, the cortical atrophy related to HA in patients with AD may represent disrupted cortical brain networks in connection with HA. However, since the topography of HA-related cortical thinning in groups with Clinical Dementia Ratings (CDR) of 0.5 and 1 corresponded to the stages I\u2013II and III\u2013IV of Braak and Braak staging, respectively, we could not exclude the possibility of the \u201cconcomitant hypothesis,\u201d i.e. that these areas are affected concomitantly with the hippocampus.",

The bivariate analyses revealed that those who were eating out less often were more likely older, widowed, pensioners, with elementary or less than elementary education, suffering from hypertension, overweight or obese, with bad self-rated health, complaining for xerostomia, with difficulties chewing hard food and with fewer natural teeth. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified as significant predictors for less frequently eating out older age and low educational level.

In addition, the joint angular velocity was significantly correlated with self-efficacy (r\u00a0=\u00a00.219\u20130.329, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01\u20130.05) and HRQOL (r\u00a0=\u00a00.207\u20130.359, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01\u20130.05). The absolute value of the correlation coefficient of angular velocity tended to be greater than that of the muscle strength for mobility functions such as walking velocity and the timed-up-and-go (TUG) test. In conclusion, it was found that the assessment of the angular velocity of the knee joint using a gyroscope could be a feasible and meaningful measurement in the geriatrics field.",

     "abstract": "Medical utilization by elderly population is influenced by a number of factors, and physical disabilities may play an important role. Despite the fact that extensive studies have been carried evaluating medical utilization by older individuals, little is known regarding the impact of physical disabilities on eye care utilization. Using datasets from the Taiwan National Health Interview Survey and National Health Insurance (NHI) system, a sample of 1726 elderly people was obtained for analysis. Older persons with worse Activity of Daily Living (ADL) disabilities were less likely to have eye care (odds ratio (OR): 0.39, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.25\u20130.62), but elderly who had Instrumental Activity of Daily Living (IADL) disabilities alone were not associated with lower odds (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.86, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.61\u20131.20). In addition to the above, female individuals (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.91, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.44\u20132.53), those with poorer vision (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.89, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.36\u20132.62), those having eye discomfort (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.66, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.26\u20132.18 and OR\u00a0=\u00a02.14, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01. 32\u20133.46 respectively for mild and more than moderate eye discomfort), and those with severe eye disease (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.96, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.23\u20133.10) were more likely to undergo eye care. In conclusion, physical disability is a strong risk factor for lack of eye care utilization among older Taiwanese. The barriers associated with low eye care utilization among individuals with ADL disabilities should be explored in order to facilitate effective policy implementation among those elderly with disabilities so that they are able to receive appropriate eye care.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate short and long-term mortality and quality of life (QoL) of elderly patients (80 years and older) admitted to two ICUs for medical conditions, abdominal surgery (planned and unplanned) and orthopedic surgery for hip fractures, over a 6-year period. Three months and one year after ICU discharge, patients or family members were contacted by telephone to obtain follow-up information using the EuroQoL questionnaire. The data were compared with an age-matched of the Italian population. Two hundred eighty-eight patients were included in the study. ICU mortality of medical (14.8%) and unplanned surgical patients (26.4%) was higher than that of planned surgical (5.0%) and orthopedic patients (2.5%), as was hospital mortality (27.7% vs. 50.0% vs. 5.0% vs. 14.3%). Three months and 12 months mortality rates after ICU discharge were 40.7% and 61.1% in medical patients, 70.5% and 76.4% in unplanned surgical patients, 20.0% and 30.0% in planned surgical patients, 36.2% and 46.2% in orthopedic patients. QoL measures revealed that, one year after ICU discharge, medical and orthopedic patients had significantly more severe problems vis-\u00e0-vis mobility, self-care and activity than abdominal surgical patients and control population. Type of admission was the independent risk factor associated with ICU and long-term mortality, whereas age 90 year and older was associated with long-term mortality. Orthopedic surgery for hip fractures seems to influence QoL similar to medical diseases.",

Then, the aims of this cross-sectional preliminary study were comparing thoracic kyphosis degree, trunk muscle peak torque and joint position sense among healthy and osteoporotic elderly women and investigating possible factors affecting the kyphosis degree. Twenty women were selected for 2 groups: healthy (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and osteoporotic (n\u00a0=\u00a010) elderly women. Bone mineral density (BMD), thoracic kyphosis degree, trunk muscles peak torque and joint position sense were measured. Differences among groups were analyzed by Student's Test T for unpaired data. Correlations between variables were performed by Pearson's coefficient correlation. The level of significance used for all comparisons was 5% (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). We observed that the osteoporotic women demonstrated a significantly higher degree of kyphosis and lower trunk extensor muscle peak torque. Moreover, it was found that the BMD had a negative correlation with the thoracic kyphosis degree. Kyphosis degree showed a negative correlation between extensor muscle strength and joint position sense index. This study suggests that lower BMD may be associated to higher degree of kyphosis degree, lower trunk extensors muscle strength and an impaired joint position sense. It is also suggested that lower extensor muscle strength may be a factor that contributes to the increasing in kyphosis thoracic degree.",

The data exhibited high quality with a low missing rate of under 5% in any age groups for each variable. Effects of age and sex on the changes in the four health variables were assessed using multiple regression models with age and sex interactions included. Upon the highly significant effects of age on all four measurements, we observed substantially higher grip strength for men who, however, exhibited a faster age-related decline than for women. No sex difference or age\u2013sex interaction was found in the number of teeth lost. Near visual acuity displayed a faster age-related decline in women than in men but neither the overall sex difference nor age\u2013sex interaction reached statistical significance. For hearing function, while no sex difference was found at middle frequency, women had better sensitivity at high frequency and men were more sensitive at low frequency. Multivariate analysis did not support an age-related common mechanism underlying the four health variables.",

This study investigated the risk factors and health-related behaviors associated with depressive symptoms using a national survey of Taiwanese elderly with a 4-year follow-up period. In this prospective cohort study, 1481 non-demented population-based elderly were interviewed at baseline in 2003 and at follow-up in 2007. The independent variables included demographics, chronic medical diseases and health-related behaviors assessed at baseline. The dependent variable was depressive symptoms assessed at follow-up. Reduced rank regression was applied to characterize independent factors related to depressive symptoms. The prevalence of depressive symptoms at follow-up was 21.1%. The results of multivariate analyses revealed three independent risk factors for depressive symptoms: fewer leisure activities (odds ratio, OR\u00a0=\u00a00.56, 95% confidence interval, CI\u00a0=\u00a00.38\u20130.83, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0034), more mobility limitations (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.93, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.30\u20132.86, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0011) and higher stress levels (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.43, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.68\u20133.50, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The leisure activities least associated with depression were reading newspapers/books and doing outdoor building projects; the two mobility limitations most associated with depression were difficulty in lifting things and in climbing stairs. The two stresses most associated with depression were perceived health stress and financial stress. These results indicated that interventions to prevent or reduce depression in older adults should include practical strategies aimed at these modifiable risk factors.",

Subjects were 1268 elderly, community-dwelling Japanese aged 65 years or older. Low muscle mass was defined by appendicular muscle mass index (AMI, weight [kg]/height [m2]), measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). We classified \u201cmiddle\u201d AMI as a value 1\u20132 standard deviation (SD) below the young normal mean of AMI and \u201clow\u201d as more than 2 SD below the young normal mean. Examination of IADL was performed using the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology Index of Competence (TMIG-IC) questionnaire. In this study, 17.2% and 26.2% of elderly men and women, respectively, were classified as having low muscle mass. There was a significant association with age and the change from normal to middle to low muscle mass in both men and women. The prevalence of IADL disability also increased significantly as muscle mass decreased. After adjustment for age and BMI, low muscle mass was significantly associated with IADL disability in men and women. Furthermore, middle muscle mass was significantly associated with IADL disability in women. This study revealed that low muscle mass, defined as a value 2 SD below the mean of young adults, had a significant association with IADL disability in elderly Japanese. Interventions to prevent age-related losses in muscle mass may be an effective strategy to prevent IADL disability among the elderly.",

Two focus groups involving 10 participants in the FREEDOM trial were also held at the end of the intervention period. Common themes were derived from the interview and focus group transcripts. Principal results: The study showed that the perceived health benefits did not influence adherence with the sun exposure. Factors such as socializing with others and being outdoors were more important in encouraging attendance. The main barriers to adherence included the perceived inflexibility and regimentation of daily attendance, clash with other activities, unsuitable timing and heat discomfort. Major conclusions: This study showed that providing greater flexibility and autonomy to older people in how and when they receive sun exposure is likely to improve adherence.",

We sought to determine the extent to which a higher number of inflammatory-related diseases is associated with frailty and to identify the most common disease patterns associated with being frail in older adults. We performed binomial regression analyses to assess whether a higher count of inflammatory-related diseases increases the probability of frailty using data from the WHAS I and II, companion cohorts composed of 70\u201379-year-old community-dwelling older women in Baltimore, Maryland (n\u00a0=\u00a0620). An increase of one inflammatory-related disease was associated log-linearly with frailty (Prevalence Ratio (PR)\u00a0=\u00a02.28, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.81\u20132.87).

Accuracy for prediction of these outcomes was investigated using area under the curve (AUC) statistics.

Total mortality adjusted for both gender and serum level of total cholesterol fell 5\u20136% with a 1-kg increase in the handgrip strength of a single hand or both hands. Total mortality also decreased 2% with a 1\u00a0kg increase in the leg extension strength of both legs. With adjustment for gender and total cholesterol, mortality fell by 57% in participants of the walking test and fell by 45% in participants of the stepping-rate test compared to mortality in nonparticipants. No association was found between mortality and participation in the handgrip strength test, leg extension strength test, or one-leg standing time test. In conclusion, not only poor muscle strength in handgrip or leg extension, but also nonparticipation in walking test or leg-stepping test were independent predictors of total mortality in a very elderly population.",

As of January 1, 2005, 12,650 community-dwelling patients over 60 years of age were impaneled with a primary care practice at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN. This was a retrospective cohort study utilizing an administrative risk score, the ERA score. Primary outcomes were 2-year mortality and 2-year nursing home placement. The predictor variable was ERA score. Relative risk estimates were used to describe the association between the ERA index and mortality and nursing home placement. The relative risk of 2-year mortality was 51.4 (95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a0CI\u00a0=\u00a028.0\u201394.4) in patients in the highest risk group compared to the lowest group. The relative risk of nursing home placement was 113.2 (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a076.1\u2013168.4). Patients with high ERA scores are at high risk for 2-year mortality and 2-year nursing home placement. These findings suggest that the utilization of an electronic risk score can help identify patients at risk for death or nursing home placement. Clinically, the identification of high risk individuals may be useful for utilization of clinical case management.",

The aim of this paper was to assess the nutrition and nutritional status in elderly individuals above 60 years old living in their family houses in rural areas. Dietary intake and nutritional status were measured in 174 elderly women and 64 men living in the rural areas of Ole\u015bnica (near Wroc\u0142aw, SW Poland). Energy intake, consumption of nutrients, selected anthropometric and biochemical indicators, were measured in two groups: one at risk of malnutrition and one with adequate nutrition. Using the mini nutritional assessment (MNA) questionnaire, 238 persons over 60 years of age were qualified according to their nutritional status. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were measured. The group of women at risk of malnutrition (n\u00a0=\u00a030) showed a statistically significantly lower energy intake in their diet (1127\u00a0kcal) compared to women with adequate nutrition (1351\u00a0kcal). The entire group of examined individuals showed a too low consumption of fiber, calcium, vitamins C and D, and folates. Most of the examined women had a too high body mass index (BMI) (on average 28.8), waist circumference was 96.3\u00a0cm, and the triceps skinfold (TSF) was 25.2\u00a0mm thick. Women at a risk of malnutrition had statistically significantly lower lipid parameters than those with adequate nutrition (respectively: TC 191.1 vs. 219.1\u00a0m/dl, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, LDL-cholesterol 107.1 vs. 125.1\u00a0m/dl, p\u00a0<\u00a00.008, TG 129 vs. 143\u00a0mg/dl). Men with a risk of malnutrition had a statistically significantly lower BMI (26.0 vs. 28.7, p\u00a0<\u00a00.04), and also lower waist and arm perimeters compared to men with correct nutrition. According to the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), 8.2% of person with adequate nutrition had poor prognostic indicator for overall survival. All the examined individuals showed many significant nutritional deficiencies. The group with nutritional risk had more pronounced nutritional deficiencies. Despite a too low energy value of foods among individuals with correct nutrition, their anthropometric parameters paradoxically showed the presence of excessive fatty tissue. The most frequent diseases existed in examined group were coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure.",

Homebound participants tended to be older, female, have obese or underweight body mass index (BMI), poorer health, lower functional status, less income, higher depressed affect, were significantly lonelier (in CALAS), and more likely to have stairs and no elevators, than their counterparts. Predictors of becoming homebound include low functional IADL status, having stairs and no elevator (in both cohorts), old age, female gender, and being obese or underweight (in CALAS). The study shows that homebound status is a prevalent problem in old-old Israelis. Economic and socio-demographic resources, environment, and function play a role in determining the older person's homebound status.

The results of the new tests confirm the previous results, both with regard to the decline of the psychophysical characteristics from the first age-group to the others but the decrease is not as significant as the previous, and with regard to the greater physical decline. What is surprising is that the decline of both the psychic and the physical characteristics concerns only the first age-group, not the other two.

We planned to investigate the following items in geriatric Turkish population: to calculate the decrease in height with advancing age by using the standing height measurement and estimated height derived from the knee height; to evaluate the significance of difference between the two measurement methods in the calculation of body mass index (BMI) and waist/height ratio (WHtR); to determine the cut-off value of WHtR according to estimated height in elderly individuals. We studied 551 cases aged between 19 and 97 years. Knee height was measured using a sliding caliper in a sitting position. Linear regression analysis was carried out to derive predictive equations for the estimation of stature with adults (\u226450 years of age) according to the gender. This equation was then used to estimate height among elderly subjects. Of the cases, 60.3% were <60 years (mean: 48.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.50); 39.7% of the cases were >60 years (mean: 69.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.12).

EBMI measurements in the females <60 years were 0.32\u00a0kg/m2 higher than their real BMIs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). There is a statistically significant difference between WHtR in the females of both age groups, and in the males >60 years, as compared to our estimated WHtR (EWHtR) measurements (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The cut-off point of WHtR was 0.61 and 0.58 in the female and male cases of >60 years in our study, respectively.

Recent investigations have shown that social networks, social engagement and participation act like predictors of disability among the elderly. The aim of this study is to determine whether social networks are related to the development and progression of disability in the early years of old age. The source of data is the first wave of the survey \u201cProcesses of Vulnerability among Spanish Elderly\u201d, carried out in 2005 to a sample of 1244 individuals. The population object of study is the cohort aged 70\u201374\u00a0years in metropolitan areas (Madrid and Barcelona) and not institutionalized. Disability is measured by the development of basic activities of daily life (ADL), and instrumental activities of daily life (IADL). The structural aspects of the social relationships are measured through the diversity of social networks and participation. We used the social network index (SNI). For each point over the SNI, the risk of developing any type of disability decreased by 49% (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.51, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.31\u20130.82). The SNI was a decisive factor in all forecasting models constructed with some hazard ratios (HR) that ranged from 0.29 (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.14\u20130.59) in the first model to 0.43 (95%CI 0.20\u20130.90) in the full model. The results of the present study showed a strong association between an active social life, emotional support provided by friends and confidents and disability. These findings suggest a protective effect of social networks on disability. Also, these results indicate that some family and emotional ties have a significant effect on both the prevalence and the incidence of disability.",

Two groups were identified: low care utilizers (LCU), with \u22646 visits to family physicians (FP)/year and high care utilizers (HCU) with \u226516 visits to FP/year. Data were collected during a structured face-to-face individual interview. The study population included 180 patients, of them 86 (47.7%) were LCU and 94 (52.2%) were HCU. In all clinical measurements the HCU group indicators were statistically significant worse off than the LCU group: average depressive symptoms (5.6 vs. 2.5, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), memory complaints (57.5% vs. 23.3%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), Barthel Index (BI) (89.9 vs. 96.0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), OARS (10.8 vs. 12.5, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and co-morbidity: total cumulative score (TCS) of Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) (2.2 vs. 1.3, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Our study raises the possibility that at least one of the reasons for over-utilization of health services by older residents in the community is depressive symptomatology.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in a group of patients with dizziness. The statistical relationships between age and each scale were studied. This cross-sectional study revealed a high correlation between DHI subgroups and HADS subscales. We found statistical correlation between neither age and HADS subscales nor age and DHI subgroups. In addition, Short-Form 36 Health Survey Questionnaires (SF-36) showed a high correlation with the dizziness handicap severity. The present study revealed that age does not influence mood disorders and the severity of dizziness in dizzy patients.",

Elderly suicide victims seem to possess different characteristics. Aim of our study was to elucidate the different characteristics of elderly suicide victims. Data was collected from a two-year psychological autopsy study, conducted at the Athens\u2019 Department of Forensic Medicine, the largest in Greece. Elderly suicide victims represented 35% of total suicides. The majority (69.5%) were males. Only 12.4% had previous psychiatric hospitalization but more than half (65.2%) had psychiatric history (81% of them had history of depression). As expected, there was a high incidence of physical illness (81.6%). The majority (82%) of the elderly suicide victims made a suicide attempt for the first time and it was unfortunately successful. When the elderly suicide victims were divided in two categories (\u201cyoung-old\u201d and \u201cold-old\u201d) the differences between the two groups were: elderly over 75 years had more physical problems and more frequently positive psychiatric history without ever been hospitalized for psychiatric problems. Late life suicides seem to encapsulate population groups with different characteristics. Their differences can be a useful guide aiming to formulate specific suicide prevention strategies. This is of great importance, given the very high frequency of completed suicides in this age group.",

Despite loneliness is one of the main indicators of well-being, little attention has been paid to understanding loneliness among immigrant older adults. This study utilizes both survey questionnaires and semi-structured focus group methods to investigate the feelings of loneliness among U.S. Chinese older adults. Based on interviews with 78 community-dwelling Chinese older adults in Chicago Chinatown, this community-based participatory research study (CBPR) shows loneliness is common among U.S. Chinese older adults. It was frequently identified through emotional isolation and social isolation. Social, psychological and physical health factors could contribute to the experience of loneliness. In addition, the health of older adults with loneliness may be associated with worsening overall health, elder mistreatment, health behavior changes and increased healthcare utilizations. This study has implications for healthcare professionals, social services agencies and policy makers. Our findings point to the needs for healthcare professionals to be more alert of the association of loneliness and adverse health outcomes. Communities and social services agencies should collectively take a lead in reducing social isolation, improving intergenerational relationships, and increasing social networks and companionship for this group of vulnerable older adults.",

Prevalence of all-type MCI, amnestic-type MCI (am-MCI) and non-amnestic-type MCI (nam-MCI) was assessed using comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. The association between demography, socioeconomic status, lifestyle practices, and nutritional status and health risk factors with MCI were examined. Predictors of MCI occurrence between gender disparities were determined. The prevalence of all-type MCI, am-MCI and nam-MCI was 21.1%, 15.4% and 5.7%, respectively. Binary logistic regression indicated that hypercholesterolemia is the significant predictor for MCI in men after adjustment for age, ethnicity and total years of education. While, in women, MCI was best predicted by married status, without exercise practice, overweight and obesity. These results suggest that approximately one-fifth of the studied elderly people had MCI. Predictors for MCI are totally different between men and women.

MRS was performed on 13 aMCI patients and 11 patients with no cognitive impairment (NCI). Localizing voxels were placed within the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, posterior cingulate gyrus, and occipital white matter in the dominant hemisphere. N-acetyl aspartate/creatinine (NAA/Cr) ratios in the entorhinal cortex were significantly lower in aMCI patients than in NCI subjects. After a three-year follow-up, seven aMCI patients converted to AD and six remained stable. Baseline NAA/Cr ratios of entorhinal cortex were decreased in converters, compared to NCI.

The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores were compared in participants with functional disability to perform basic and instrumental activities. Cognitive status influenced functional dependence on activities of daily living, basic (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.1, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a02.7\u20136.1) and instrumental (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.7, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a03.5\u20139.3), independently of gender, age, educational level and health conditions. Besides, cognitive impairment was associated with the dependence on certain basic (e.g., bathing, toileting) and instrumental (e.g., using the telephone, taking medications, and handling finances) activities. This was a gradual relationship, the highest cognitive decline implied the highest loss of ability at carrying out activities, with a larger impact on basic activities. These findings suggest that cognitive decline can be a predictor for functional dependence, independently of other variables, and turn into a very useful tool indicating the need for support.",

Clinical data on patients in whom enteral feeding was initiated after a period of poor oral intake are presented. Patients with evidence of volume depletion, signs of gastrointestinal bleeding or medicines that might increase BUN were excluded. We evaluated 5 patients (mean age 90.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03 years) who were admitted to geriatric department. Mean plasma creatinine concentration was 1.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.34\u00a0mg/dl, but mean estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was 41.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2. Enteral nutrition was administered at a dose of mean 1580\u00a0\u00b1\u00a053\u00a0ml/day at mean duration of 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 days. Mean BUN was 52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030\u00a0mg/dl at baseline, increases to 109\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.4\u00a0mg/dl after initiation of feeding and decreased to 82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0mg/dl with reduction of dose of enteral nutrition. Our conclusion was that initiation of enteral feeding may induce a large accumulation of nitrogen waste products in elderly patients in whom serum creatinine is an unreliable indicator of kidney function. High protein intake should be considered in differential diagnosis of disproportionate high increment of BUN.",

(3) Use information-gain to select features, to reduce the total number of attributes to 17. (4) Utilize multiple regression to test the degree of co-linearity and select features, the dimension of dataset is reduced to 8 attributes and 2737 records. (5) Finally, the rules of HD-quality and accuracy performance are generated by granular rough set theory. In performance comparison, the decision tree (DT-C4.5), the Na\u00efve Bayes (NB) probabilistic model and Artificial Neural Networks-Multilayer Perceptrons (ANN-MLP) are employed to compare with the proposed procedure in accuracy. The results can assist doctors to reduce the time of diagnosis and to achieve dose of fitness-based dialysis for the patients.",

The aim of the study was to determine the connection between the SOC levels and life satisfaction among the U3A students. Another analyzed relationship was the SOC level against the background of socio-demographic factors. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men, at the average age of 64.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.01 years. The vast majority of the study group included individuals at the secondary education level, as well as married individuals. Just over half of the group claimed to be in good health, and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The study was conducted with the diagnostic poll method, using the standardized questionnaires: The Scale SOC-29, WHOQOL-Bref, and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-bref version). The average value of global SOC was 128.77; the standard deviation 21.04; discrepancy 153 (minimum 50 and maximum 203). The SOC indicated significant relationship with quality of life (QoL) in the mental domain, social relationships, and environmental domain; no significant correlation in the physical domain was observed. The QOL reached about 70% of maximum result value, showing equal levels in its specific areas. A moderately decreasing (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.375, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) relation \u03b7\u00a0=\u00a00.376, between global SOC values and depression occurrence, as well as its non-existence was shown in the study. Individual SOC components were also negatively correlated with depression. Another observation was weak correlation between the sense of coherence and the individuals\u2019 level of education. No statistically significant effect of age, gender and marital status on the SOC levels of U3A students was found. Higher parameters of SOC and level of education shape significantly higher effects of life satisfaction, and result in better adaptation to old age stage as a phase of multiple challenges, and increasing life difficulties.",

In fact, although for many years PD has been considered only \u201ca disease that affects walking\u201d, with a key role of the neurotransmitter dopamine, recently the neurological approach has been substantially modified. The approach for this disease is not only a neurological issue. Given the complexity of its clinical aspects, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, sleep disorder, pneumonia dysfagia-related and malnutrition, a multidisciplinary evaluation and not just a neurological evaluation is needed. We suggest a n multidisciplinary approach for this old actor, underlying a subtle link between neurophatological stages of the disease (Braak's classification) and clinical aspects (Braak's stages 1 and 2 associated with the premotor phase; Braak's stages 3\u20134 associated with the motor symptoms and Braak's stages 5\u20136 associated with cognitive impairment).

Those with infections were compared to the group without to determine and compare clinical characteristics. Factors included in analysis were: age, gender, diagnoses, medical comorbidity, neuropsychiatric symptoms, functional outcomes, medications and LOS. Both groups were similar in gender, psychiatric diagnoses and severity of dementia. Those requiring antibiotics for treatment of infections on admission, were older (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), had poorer baseline function (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) and higher medical comorbidity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

A prospective study including patients aged 70 and over hospitalized for acute decompensated HF was performed. The baseline measures were demographics, comorbidity, clinical, functional and cognitive status. The outcome for this study was death within one year from the index hospital admission date. During the length of the study, 32.7% patients died (20.7% within the first three months). The clinical features associated with HF-related mortality in the univariate analysis were institutionalization, a higher dependence in performing basic activities or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). Older age did not correlate with mortality, nor did left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), the ejection fraction or the pharmacological treatment at discharge. After performing the logistic regression analysis, the only variable independently related to a higher mortality risk at one year was the preadmission dependence in performing basic activities of daily living (BADL). The results of this study highlight that preadmission functional and sociodemographic variables are the best predictors of mortality at one year, surpassing the classic prognostic factors. Performing an adequate assessment at the time of admission, which should include a functional evaluation, may help us to better classify patients and to offer them a customized therapeutic plan with better prognostic capabilities.",

There were no correlations between kind of chronic disease and PMS, NHP, FIM (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) in either of genders. It was found that there are differences among elderly female and male individuals with a chronic disease in terms of the number of chronic diseases, types of chronic disease, mobility level, functional status and QoL; and mobility level is related to functional capacity and QoL in females. It is thought that the rehabilitation programs to improve physical and functional capacity in elderly people and applications that increase participation in activities and reduce pain may improve QoL.",

Only depressed affect and age remained significant predictors at all three follow-up periods in the multivariate analysis. Physical and verbal aggressive agitation and declining caregiver health were significant predictors in the short term. Socializing and ethnicity became predictors at year three. We have demonstrated that while some predictors of nursing home placement are robust over varying follow-up times, the predictive value of others changes with length of the follow-up period.

Nearly 40% of these deaths occurred within 24\u00a0h of admission indicating a high level of less appropriate admissions. Investigating eight nursing homes which admitted the highest number of patients from one primary care trust revealed that the most cited reasons for admission were the lack of advance care plans, access to General Practitioners (GPs) out of hours, as well as general access to palliative care and specialist nurses, and poor communication between patient, relatives, GPs, hospitals and care home staff.

The participants consisted of 68 patients with AD, 23 patients with VaD, and 59 patients with PDD, who were diagnosed by the individual criteria, respectively. Cognitive screening was evaluated using the Korean version of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Repeated evaluations were conducted at 6-month, 1 year, and 2 years after initial baseline assessment. Rates of cognitive decline were calculated by dividing MMSE score differences by the number of months lapsed. No difference was found between the three dementia subtypes with respect to baseline MMSE scores. Cognitive decline was not obvious up to 6-month of the follow-up, but by 12-month of follow-ups was significant regardless of the dementia subtype. Furthermore, the rate of cognitive decline in the AD group was significantly faster than in the PDD or VaD groups. This study suggests that rate of cognitive deterioration in dementia is not linear over time and that dementia subtypes have different rates of cognitive deterioration.",

Although it is well known that environmental conditions can modulate the susceptibility to infection, and that poor nutritional status can increase the risk of contracting infection when exposed to an infectious agent, the effects of environmental conditions and nutritional status on the heat shock response have not been investigated. Therefore, we studied the heat shock response in a special elderly population living in a remote area in Cameroon, where infection and parasitosis are endemic. Our results indicate a significant increase in Hsp70 serum levels with increasing degree of inflammation.

Diagnosis of pneumonia was performed according to the criteria of McGeer for the identification of pneumonia at an LTC facility. The severities of pneumonia and mortality prediction were assessed by three indices: PSI (pneumonia severity index), Missouri study index and the nursing home associated pneumonia (NHAP) severity index. A strong positive correlation was found between CRP levels and PSI (r\u00a0=\u00a00.445, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), Missouri study index (r\u00a0=\u00a00.315, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and NHAP severity index (r\u00a0=\u00a00.246, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

In the total sample of participants, the 61.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a0164) of the group has been diagnosed as MS. High blood pressure (BP) and waist circumference (WC) and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were the criteria of MS with highest prevalence in both gender. In addition female participants have higher systolic blood pressure (93.4%) and WC (79.1%) and lower HDL-C (69.2%) than the men (74.4%, 31.1% and 52.2% respectively). Weight correlated significantly with triglyceride (TG) and MS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Study participants were two hundred and thirteen people aged 65 years and older (mean age, 80.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.1 years), who used day-care services in Japan. The outcome measures were the history of falls three months retrospectively and physical risk factors for falling, including performance in the chair stand test (CST), one-leg standing test (OLS), tandem walk test, 6\u00a0m walking time, and the timed up-and-go (TUG) test. Thirty-nine (18.3%) of the 213 participants had fallen at least one or more times during the preceding 3 months. The fall group had significantly slower 6\u00a0m walking speed and took significantly longer to undertake the TUG test than the non-fall group. In a structural equation model, performance in the CST contributed significantly to gait function, and low gait function was significantly and directly associated with falls in older people. This suggests that task-specific strength exercise as well as general mobility retraining should be important components of exercise programs designed to reduce falls in older people.",

In these subjects, the range of motion (ROM) of ankle, knee, hip, elbow and shoulder were measured with a double-armed goniometer. Moreover, abnormalities of supraspinatus, patellar and Achilles tendons were evaluated with a standardized ultrasound (US) procedure. A significant reduction in the mobility of all joints was found in elderly subjects, compared to younger ones, with exception for the knee and elbow flexion. Elderly patients with diabetes, compared with their age-matched counterpart, showed LJM for ankle dorso- and plantar flexion, hip flexion and adduction, shoulder abduction and flexion. Moreover, tendons sonographic abnormalities were more frequently observed in diabetics. Our data confirm that diabetes worsens the LJM in the elderly, increasing the cross-linking of collagen by the non-enzymatic advanced glycation end products formation.",

Two months later data were collected with respect to three outcomes, namely overall functioning, ability to carry out activities of daily living as measured by the Barthel Index (BI), and quality of life (QoL), as measured by the assessment of quality of life (AQoL) instrument. Syndromal depression was highly prevalent (28%) and syndromal anxiety was less common (5% prevalence), but neither was predictive of functional outcome. The strongest predictor of outcome was physical health status on admission to hospital. The results suggest that in physically unwell, very old populations, physical health factors may be stronger predictors of functioning than psychological variables. The findings also highlight some difficulties in the use of psychological measures in old\u2013old populations, and the need for more research that recognizes the oldest old as a distinct group.",

All SF-36 domains, except role-emotional, were significantly correlated with the YPAS activity dimension summary index. Physical function, role-physical, general health and vitality correlated with total time activity, and correlations were observed between weekly energy expenditure and physical function, role physical, vitality and mental health. Depressive symptom scores correlated significantly with the YPAS activity dimension summary index and the weekly energy expenditure. Scores for various domains of the SF-36 and for depressive symptoms significantly differed among less and more active individuals of the same sex and institutionalization category. Differences generally reached a higher extent in institutionalized subjects in comparison to community dwellers. In conclusion, physical activity was related to different domains of both the physical and mental components of HRQoL and to decreased depressive symptoms.

In addition, the associations between changes in loneliness with health are less well known, especially in the case of aging people. The present study examined whether absence of loneliness in 2005 predicted subsequent good SRH in 2008, and whether changes in loneliness were associated with SRH in 2008. Longitudinal, questionnaire-based data were collected from three age cohorts (born in 1926\u201330, 1936\u201340, and 1946\u201350) living in southern Finland.

Logistic regression analyses were used to derive the results. Never or seldom experiencing loneliness was a strong predictor for good SRH. In addition, good health was common among those who never felt lonely. Among men the group experiencing decreasing loneliness had the highest OR of good health. Thus, loneliness is a significant contributor to poor SRH among aging people. In addition, favorable SRH is indicated not only by the absence of loneliness at both measurement points, but also by decreased loneliness. Preventing loneliness is important for health promotion.",

A weighted sum score of lack of social connections (LSC) was estimated. Associations between LSC score by quartiles and risk of mortality were examined prospectively using Cox's proportional hazard regression models. The results show that within an eight-year follow-up, African Americans (AA) had the highest age-adjusted all-cause mortality (48.7%), followed by white Americans (WA) (44.7%), and Asian Americans (ASA) (38.4%). Participants within the highest quartile of LSC score had 2 times higher risk of death from heart disease, cancer, and all-causes among AA, and 1.40\u20131.80 times higher among WA than those within the lowest quartile (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). No significant association was observed among ASA, which was likely due to the small sample size of the ASA participants.

CRP was weakly and inversely correlated with the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1%) (Spearman's \u03b6\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.15; p\u00a0<\u00a00.027), while ESR was not (Spearman's \u03b6\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.05; p\u00a0=\u00a00.411). The highest prevalence of anemia and hypoalbuminemia and the lowest FEV1% were recorded in high ESR\u2013high CRP group. For anemia B\u00a0=\u00a014.180\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.521 (\u00b1S.E.M.); p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and hypoalbuminemia B\u00a0=\u00a010.241\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.790; p\u00a0=\u00a00.007 qualified as significant independent correlates of ESR values, while only FEV1 remained significantly associated with CRP values (B\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.570\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.258; p\u00a0=\u00a00.028). In conclusion, CRP, but not ESR, shows a weak correlation with COPD severity, while anemia and hypoalbuminemia are main correlates of high ESR. Neither ESR, nor CRP qualify as reliable markers of COPD severity and seem to reflect the effects of different determinants.",

Considering the differential profile of elderly Brazilians regarding their socioeconomic and cultural aspects, the objectives of this study were: to assess the correlation and differences between levels of IL-6 and socioeconomic status (education and income) in elderly women. IL-6 levels were measured using ELISA. The Spearman test was used to determine the correlation between IL-6 and socioeconomic status, and the Kruskal\u2013Wallis and Mann\u2013Whitney tests for cytokine level differences across education and income. IL-6 showed a significant inverse correlation with education (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.205, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) and income (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.185, p\u00a0=\u00a00.028).

In China, different age groups of old people may be influenced by different factors. For people aged 65 and above, their distribution may be more influenced by the economical factor, decreasing from east to west. However, for people aged 100 and above, they may be more influenced by the environmental factors. The number of centenarians per 100,000 is opposite to the percentage of people above 65, decreasing from west to east. Longevity index (LI%) and centenarity index (CI%) may be as index to evaluate the longevity level. The biggest LI% is in the south provinces of China, whereas the biggest CI% is in the northwestern provinces of China. The South China and Northwestern China are two longevity regions. The South China has some climatic preferences including near to the sea, having suitable mean year temperature, a large plenty of rainfall, higher relative humidity, which contribute to its relatively high longevity level. While the Northwestern China has the topographic and sunshine advantages, which help the residents there more probable to reach 100 years old. The results indicate that for old people, their distribution will be influenced by the environmental factor to some extent.",

Thirty young adults (mean age: 20) and 23 older adults (mean age: 77) were instructed to estimate, using motor imagery, whether randomly presented targets in peripersonal (within actual reach) and extrapersonal (beyond reach) space were within or out of reach of their dominant limb while seated. Results indicated that the younger group was significantly more accurate than the older adults, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001. Whereas both groups made more errors in extrapersonal space, the values were significantly higher for the older group; that is, they overestimated to a greater extent. In summary, these findings add to the general notion that there is a decline in the ability to mentally represent action with advanced age.",

     "abstract": "Dementia is one of the most relevant illnesses due to its functional impact on the elderly. The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of socio-demographic, clinical, cognitive and functional factors on the severity of dementia in elderly individuals. One hundred six elderly individuals with a diagnosis of dementia as determined by the DSM-IV/APA participated in the study. Cognition was assessed by the mini-mental state examination (MMSE); functional performance of basic and instrumental activities of daily living (BADLs and IADLs) was assessed by the Katz index (KI), Lawton\u2013Brody index (LBI) and Pfeffer index (PI). The severity of dementia was established through the clinical dementia rating (CDR). In order to determine the influence of factors on the degree of dementia, ordinal regression analysis was performed. Age, MMSE, KI, LBI and PI scores had statistically significant associations to the severity of dementia. However, only the age (odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a00.197; confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a00.060\u20130.643) and performance in IADLs (LBI: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.237, CI\u00a0=\u00a01.077\u20131.422; PI: OR\u00a0=\u00a00.641, CI\u00a0=\u00a00.548\u20130.750) were maintained in the final ordinal regression model, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.818. The results show that elderly individuals over 80 years of age and those with a more compromised performance in IADLs have a greater chance of exhibiting more severe degrees of dementia. These findings suggest that the ability to perform IADLs may be an important variable in differentiating degrees of the severity of dementia.",

It has been reported that 11.5\u201314% of community-dwelling elderly patients were prescribed for at least one PIM, but little is known regarding to it in rural Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and risk factors of PIMs among older patients visiting the outpatient clinic of a community health center in rural Taiwan. In August of 2008, all elderly patients attended the outpatient clinic of a community health center in I-Lan County were enrolled for study. PIMs are evaluated by Beers\u2019 criteria. In total, 327 patients (mean age: 74.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3 years old, 49.5% males) were enrolled, and 27.5% (90/327) of them were prescribed for at least one PIM. The most common PIMs were antihistamines (50.9%) and muscle relaxants (39.0%). In particular, 87.6% of these PIMs were having a high severity potential. Patients had PIMs were significantly older (76.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.9 vs. 74.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1 years, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), being prescribed for more drugs (3.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 vs. 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7 items, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and more commonly to visit due to acute diseases (64.4% vs. 24.9%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than those had no PIM.

     "abstract": "With increasing age of the general population, the necessity for cardiac surgery in the collective of patients aged 90 and older has been increasing. To aid in the choice of adequate therapy we investigated our experience for the group of nonagenarians undergoing surgical interventions. From 6/2000 to 9/2007, 17 patients aged 90 and older underwent open-heart surgery at our institution. We performed a retrospective data analysis including baseline preoperative clinical status, intra- and postoperative results and the long-term survival in the further postoperative course. We performed cardiac surgical procedures in 17 patients (male/female ratio 6/11), including isolated aortic valve replacement (n\u00a0=\u00a07), aortic root replacement (n\u00a0=\u00a02), isolated coronary bypass surgery (n\u00a0=\u00a04), combined coronary and valve surgery (n\u00a0=\u00a05), re-operative valve replacement (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and root replacement with arch repair (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Emergency procedures were performed in 11.8% (2/17). Mean age was 91.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 years, ranging 90.1\u201394.2. Mean follow-up was 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2 years. The 30-day mortality was 17.6% (3/17), overall mortality at 42.9 follow-up patient years was 58.8% (10/17). We conclude that cardiac surgery procedures can be performed with therapeutic benefit for selected nonagenarians safely and with acceptable operative risk. After analysis our clinical experience we believe age alone not to be a contraindication for surgical intervention, consideration of the physiologic status of the patient reflects on the postoperative outcome. Survival of the patients investigated that survived the initial 30-day postoperative period was similar to the estimated survival of the equally aged general population in Germany.",

Ten newly fabricated full dentures of outpatient of the National Center for Geriatrics and Gerontology in Japan were selected for this study. Two types of denture base resins were used for inspection by OCT, which provided clear images of all the dentures examined. Internal structures, not visually detectable, inspection, can be observed using this OCT system. It is concluded that OCT can detect nonvisible internal structures in dentures, a finding not reported to date.

     "abstract": "To investigate factors affecting the place of death of patients receiving home care services, we performed a retrospective cohort study using 252 elderly Japanese patients. During a 3-year period, 40 patients died at home (78.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012 years olds), and 59 patients died at hospitals (77.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.4 years olds). Patient profiles, including their demographic characteristics, comorbidities, as well as formal and informal care levels were evaluated. Patients who died at home received a shorter term of home care, suffered malignancies more often and received visiting nurse services more often than those at hospitals. Age, gender, comorbidities, laboratory data, independency of activity of daily living (ADL), number of family looking after patients, number and dose of prescriptions and number of medical treatments such as decubitus were not different between these groups. Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that patients who died at home had an increased likelihood of suffering from malignancy (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a0OR\u00a0=\u00a02.18, HR: 1.04\u20133.98, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) and an increased likelihood of receiving visiting nurse services (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.13, HR: 1.08\u20136.21, p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) compared to those who died at hospitals. Thus, dying at home may be associated with cases of malignancy compared to other diseases in Japan, and it may be associated with a greater need for home visiting nurses. In conclusion, the nature of the patient's disease and the presence of visiting nurses influenced the decision regarding the patient's place of death.

We collected data on age, gender, base-line diseases, therapeutic indications for digoxin, functional classification, ejection fraction, plasma digoxin levels, creatinine clearance, ions, gasometry, electrocardiogram, concomitant medication, symptomatology and treatment. The results were: mean age 82.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6 years, predominantly female subjects (83.7%). The most prevalent pathologies were cardiac valvulopathy (81.0%), hypertension (68.3%) and ischemic cardiopathy (46.3%), 95.1% had a background of cardiac insufficiency, and 52.6% were in functional grade III. The mean digoxin level was 2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.69\u00a0ng/ml, 23.1% of the patients had a creatinine clearance of less than 60\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2 and 2.6% had a severely reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (clearance\u00a0<\u00a030\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2). A negative correlation was found between digoxin levels and clearance (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.22; p\u00a0=\u00a00.18) and between the levels and cardiac frequency (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.35; p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). Of the patients, 47.5% presented bradycardia and 87.8% arrhythmias, most frequently auricular fibrillation. The most frequent symptoms were nausea (54.8%), fatigue (42.9%), vomiting (33.3%) and anorexia (28.6%). We conclude that clinical digestive symptoms in elderly women who are taking digitalis, with bradycardia and impaired renal functioning, should lead us to suspect digitalis intoxication.",

There has during the last decades been secular changes in demographics so that the proportion of elderly increases in society. Hence, there is an increasing need for clinicians to be able to make a solid appraisal of the elderly patient's functional capacity, as to identify individuals with an increased risk to fall. If high risk individuals could be targeted fall preventive strategies might be implemented in specific risk cohorts. This would require reference values for muscle strength tests and functional tests, in order to defined high risk individuals performing inferior. From the MrOS Sweden cohort, 999 subjects aged 70\u201380 years were evaluated. Muscle strength and functional performance was tested by timed-stands test, 6-m and 20-cm narrow walk tests and Jamar handgrip strength test. Normative data is presented. With increasing age, there was a 10\u201318% successively decline in performance throughout the entire age span. This study provides reference values for handgrip strength and functional muscle tests in 70\u201380 years old men. The decline in the test values with increasing age, infer the use of age-specific normative data when using these tests both in clinical and research settings.",

Eight hundred and ten participants had completed all six waves of the survey or were followed-up at each wave until death in the prospective study in Kaohsiung City. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Short Psychiatric Evaluation Schedule (SPES). Changes in levels of depression during the ageing process were identified. Different trajectories clearly reflected heterogeneity within depression and the association with mortality. The study highlighted that diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, heart disease and disability, whether at baseline or as new occurrences, were predictors of health decline. High uses of health/social services were also predictive of increased depression. These findings identified depression as a highly dynamic process, characterized by different trajectories of depression between states of no, mild and severe depression. Greater awareness of these various trajectories should potentially improve the prevention and/or management strategies of depression.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate how bladder management, rather than urinary incontinence, may affect the functional outcome of ischemic stroke patients. We studied 919 consecutive patients admitted for ischemic stroke rehabilitation. Level of bladder management was determined by Functional Independence Measurement (FIM TM) sub-scale scores relevant to bladder control. FIM scores less than 5 points was determined as low-bladder management score (Low-BMS) while FIM scores greater than 5 was determined as high-bladder management score (High-BMS). Data were analyzed by t-test, Pearson correlation, and chi-square test as well as by multiple linear regression analysis. There were 594 low-bladder score patients (Low-BMS) and 325 high-bladder score patients (High-BMS), at admission. Compared with High-BMS, Low-BMS patients were slightly older (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), had longer rehabilitation stays (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and lower mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Total FIM at admission and discharge were lower in Low-BMS, yet their total FIM gain upon discharge was higher, compared with High-BMS (19.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.46 vs. 17.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.55, p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). Multiple linear regression analyses showed that total FIM at discharge was inversely associated with Low-BMS at admission (beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.407; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and age (beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.127; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Low-BMS was independently predictive for total FIM gain at discharge (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.166; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The findings suggest that Low-BMS should be held as adversely affecting the rehabilitation outcomes of elderly stroke patients.

     "abstract": "There is increasing evidence for an association between WMH and large-artery atherosclerosis. We evaluated 268 patients with acute ischemic stroke to assess the relationship between intracranial (IC) atherosclerosis and WMH. The patients were classified into three groups according to the location of the stenosis; IC, extracranial (EC), and non-stenosis (NS) group. WMH were rated using the semiquantitative method of Scheltens and coworkers. The IC group had significantly more WMH score in comparison with the other groups after controlling age. The linear regression analysis showed that age was the factor most strongly associated with the total score of WMH; and the location of stenosis was positively related to WMH, especially in deep white matter. Our data show that IC stenosis is associated with WMH, indicating that IC stenosis, rather than EC stenosis, is likely to cause white matter lesions. These findings raise the possibility that occlusion of penetrating arteries, embolism to border-zone areas and a hemodynamic mechanism associated with IC stenosis leads to the formation of white matter lesions.",

Thirty-four healthy and active elderly volunteers were also recruited as the control group. To evaluate balance, we used SMART Balance Master that yields balance parameters including maximal stability, center-of-pressure velocity, and percentage ankle strategy obtained under six different balance conditions. We evaluated eye-hand coordination by measuring the movement time required to accurately point from one target to the next. In the most challenging balance conditions, the TCC group performed significantly better than the swimming and control groups. In eye-hand coordination tasks, both the TCC and swimming groups yielded significantly shorter movement time compared with the control group; however, no significant difference was observed between them.

Many community-living frail older people rely upon the support of a family member or friend. However, there is a paucity of research exploring the reactions to caring for older people empirically identified as frail. The objective of this study was to describe carers of community-living older people identified as frail, using accepted criteria, identify care characteristics and ascertain relationships that contribute to reactions to caregiving. A cross-section of carers of community-living frail people (\u226570 years) completed a postal questionnaire; the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA) evaluated reactions to caregiving. Ninety-three carers completed the questionnaire (68% response rate). Correlation and multivariate analysis of variance tests (MANOVA) demonstrated statistically significant relationships between several care characteristics and reactions to caregiving. Carers who provide more than 20\u00a0h of care per week and report a low self-perceived health status are susceptible to significant health and financial problems and disruption to their daily schedule. Two strategies for improving reactions to caring for persons with frailty are proposed: financial support that assists carers to improve their health status and the provision of regular formal assistance, rather than intermittent respite care.",

Daily physical activity was evaluated using life-space assessment (LSA) which assessed the life-space level, degree of independence, and frequency of attainment. Muscle thickness in the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, psoas major, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, biceps femoris and gastrocnemius, but not soleus, was significantly greater in the young group than the elderly group.

Materials and methods: Two hundred thirty-five consecutive patients with dementia (Alzheimer disease\u00a0=\u00a0AD, n\u00a0=\u00a094, Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), n\u00a0=\u00a0119, Vascular dementia\u00a0=\u00a0VaD, n\u00a0=\u00a022) were recruited from the memory clinic at Chungnam University hospital from January 2005 to July 2009. The Korean version of the mini-mental state examination (MMSE-K) and CDT were performed by all participants every 6 months. Scoring of the CDT performance was in accordance with the method of Mano and Wu. Error types of CDT were classified as follows: stimulus-bound response (SBR), conceptual deficit (CD), spatial and/or planning deficit (SPD) and perseveration error (PE). We divided patients into 3 groups by their initial MMSE-K score (severe, MMSE-K\u00a0\u2264\u00a017; moderate, 18\u00a0\u2264\u00a0MMSE-K\u00a0<\u00a024; mild, 24\u00a0\u2264\u00a0MMSE-K). Comparisons of CDT scores and error types in the three dementia subtypes and three cognitive groups were conducted. Results: Longitudinal changes on CDT and MMSE-K scores were not different between the three dementia subtypes. From the analysis of CDT error type, the most common error type was SPD in patients with mild to moderate dementia. In contrast, CD error was the most frequent in severe dementia group. The order of error frequency in all subjects from baseline to the last follow-up was as follows: SPD, CD, SBR and PE except CD was the most frequent error type in AD patients after 18 months from baseline. Conclusion: Longitudinal analysis of error on CDT may reflect different characteristics of cognitive deterioration according to dementia subtypes and dementia stages.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to determine the factors associated with recurrent falls in aged-care inpatients at a tertiary hospital, with a focus on the cognitive domains of recurrent fallers. We retrospectively examined the characteristics of 70 aged-care inpatients who sustained \u22652 falls; 269 patients who sustained 1 fall; and 69 non-fallers during their hospital admission. We also analyzed the available Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and sub-scores of 37 recurrent fallers, 163 single fallers, and 37 non-fallers. The independent risk factors for recurrent falls were a history of dementia, stroke, or atrial fibrillation; and patients\u2019 hospital length of stay >5 weeks. Protective factors were the patients\u2019 ability to speak English and a history of depression. Recurrent fallers had significantly lower MMSE scores than single fallers and non-fallers (17.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7, 20.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2, 24.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01); and a larger proportion of recurrent fallers had MMSE <18 than in the other two groups (54.1%, 34.4% and 10.8%, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In addition, patients with recurrent falls were more likely to have significantly lower scores in the \u2018registration\u2019, \u2018attention and calculation\u2019, \u2018recall\u2019 and \u2018praxis\u2019 domains of the MMSE than single fallers. The findings from this study suggest that cognitive impairment particularly affecting short-term memory, recall and visuospatial perception may contribute to recurrent falls in the inpatient population.

The aim of this study was to assess the QoL of students of the U3A based on socio-demographic factors, subjectively reported diseases and/or discomfort, and well-being. The study comprised 257 students of the U3A in Poland, located in the city of Bydgoszcz. The study group consisted of 237 women and 20 men at an average age of 64.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.01 years. The vast majority of the study group were married individuals and individuals with a secondary education. Just over half of the group stated that they are in good health and have no afflictions. All of the respondents were fully mobile. The QoL was assessed using the Polish version of the WHOQOL-Bref and the geriatric depression screening (GDS) scale. The QoL in its different areas balanced out at a medium level (average range: 13.30\u201313.87). The level of education of the U3A students proved to have a significant relation ith the environmental domain of QoL. No significant influence of age, gender, or marital statues on the QoL of the U3A students was found. A significant relation between subjectively reported diseases and/or discomfort with the QoL was demonstrated in the physical domain. Nearly 75% of the respondents showed no signs of depressive moods. The occurrence of depression indeed disrupted the QoL in all the studied domains, although least in the physical domain. Elderly individuals participating in permanent education display, in the face of progressive senile involution, average and at the same time stable parameters of QoL in all areas of functioning, which can be considered satisfactory, given this phase of life. The level of QoL of the U3A students significantly denotes the level of education of respondents, existing illnesses and afflictions, and the presents of depression.",

This study deals with those individuals who were assessed in the base line of 90+ project but died, dropped out or were examined in the follow-up. Participants of the 90+ project baseline consist of a sample of 188 older than 90 years, independent individuals (mean age\u00a0=\u00a092.9; 67 men and 121 women) living in the community (n\u00a0=\u00a076) or in residences (n\u00a0=\u00a0112). They were assessed through the European Survey on Aging Protocol (ESAP) by collecting anthropometric, health and life styles, bio-behavioral, psychological and social data. After 6\u201314 months from the baseline, 55% individuals were re-assessed, 11% died and 34% dropped out for several reasons. Comparisons between the individuals deceased, interviewed and those who dropped out yielded significant differences mainly due to contextual variables. The mortality rate of participants living in residences is three times greater than those of participants living in the community. Trying to determine the differences between these three groups due to bio-psycho-social variables, we found that regular physical activity, mental status, leisure activities, fitness, perceived control and openness assessed at the baseline differentiate our three groups. Finally, 90% of those individuals who died were identified at the baseline as \u201cnon successful agers\u201d, while more than a half of those who participated and a third of the non-participants were identified as \u201csuccessful agers\u201d. It can be concluded that among those independent but very old people, mortality is less important than willing to participate and contextual, behavioral and psychological factors are relevant for distinguishing mortality, survival and participation.",

     "abstract": "The rapid pace of population aging poses significant importance of establishing an age-friendly health care system, including outpatient, inpatient, intermediate, and long-term care. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of outpatient services for elderly patients in Taiwan. Quality function deployment (QFD) is a tool effectively shortening the research-and-development period, reducing costs, and fulfilling customer needs (CNs). This study applied Kano's model and the analytic network process (ANP) to improve the basic framework of QFD. Kano's model enables a thorough understanding of elderly patients\u2019 needs and problems with regard to medical care services, so that appropriate outpatient services can be offered to them from the outset. In addition, adapting the supermatrix of ANP to the calculation of the house of quality (HoQ) will reduce subjective judgments. Using Kano's model and an integrated ANP-QFD approach, we extracted five needs of elderly patients and calculated their priorities: \u2018Professional medical care services convincing patients\u2019 (27%), \u2018With sufficient knowledge to answer patients\u2019 questions\u2019 (23.5%), \u2018Providing fast services to solve patients\u2019 problems\u2019 (19.3%), \u2018Voluntarily serving patients\u2019 (19.1%), and \u2018Providing proper medical equipment to patients\u2019 (11.1%). We then identified six outpatient service attributes deserving of improvement and their priorities: \u2018Physician with a high level of professionalism and giving clear interpretation of patient's condition\u2019 (25%), \u2018Staff with good communication skills and assistance to patients\u2019 (22%), \u2018High standardization of operating procedures\u2019 (18%), \u2018Staff getting on-the-job training periodically\u2019 (15%), \u2018Facilities sufficient and fitting for elderly patients\u2019 (10%), and \u2018Applying IT (internet) to help patients to receive medical care\u2019 (10%).

A total of 142 community-dwelling women, older than 60 years, were included in the study. The mtDNA copy number, which represents the mtDNA content, was measured using real-time PCR methods. Patients with depression defined as the subjects whose 15-question geriatric depression scale (GDS) score was \u22658 or who were taking anti-depressant medication. We also measured cognitive function, physical performances (gait speed, chair-stand times, tandem standing times) and metabolic parameters. The depression group had a significantly lower mtDNA copy number than the control group (71.5 vs. 107.3; interquartile range (IQR)\u00a0=\u00a042.7\u2013116.0 vs. 51.7\u2013202.1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.028).

After adjustment for confounding factors using multiple logistic regression analysis, mtDNA copy number was significantly related to depression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025). We demonstrated that low leukocyte mtDNA content is related to depression in community dwelling old women. This finding suggests that mitochondrial dysfunction could be a mechanism of geriatric depression.",

The cohort in this study included 13 consecutive patients with DIP and 91 patients with PD; all subjects completed a clinical assessment, neuropsychological investigation, and magnetic resonance imaging of brain. All patients with DIP were followed closely for more than six months after withdrawal of the offending drug. The cognitive function in DIP was significantly worse than in controls for most domains; however, there were no significant differences found in the comparisons with the PD patients. In addition, the severity of motor impairment was in part associated with cognitive function. Some patients had transient and reversible cognitive impairment, similar to other Parkinsonian motor features, and others experienced persistence and eventual worsening of their cognitive dysfunction after discontinuation of the offending drug. The results of this study suggest that cognitive impairment in patients with DIP reflects the toxic/metabolic symptoms associated with the offending drug in addition to being a risk factor for DIP.",

Oral examination was conducted by eight dentists trained in the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended examination procedure. The chi-square test, multiple regression analyses and multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed using SAS 9.1.3. The oral health status including decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT), missing teeth, and residual teeth significantly differed between the young elderly and the old elderly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Moreover, the regression coefficients of tooth loss linearly increased across different age groups (5-year intervals, starting at age 65 years) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). However, the odds ratios of periodontal health did not significantly differ across 5-year interval age groups. The findings that age and the number of missing teeth are significantly and linearly related could contribute to the development of oral health care and promotion programs for the elderly tailored to their own age.",

There was no correlation between the TSK scores and either Harris scores or NRS scores (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) in the hip fracture group. No correlation between NRS and TSK was found in coxarthrosis group but there was a significant correlation between TSK and HHS. TSK scores were high in both groups.

     "abstract": "Introduction: OA is a multifactorial condition, which predisposes elderly individuals to disabilities. Therefore, aging, especially in women, is considered to be a risk factor for the development and progression of this disease. The aging process and the presence of degenerative diseases lead to losses of strength and proprioceptive acuity. However, studies have reported conflicting results regarding the relationships between these variables. Moreover, it is unclear whether age remains an aggravating factor of these variables in individuals with knee OA. Objectives: To analyze the relationships between measures of muscular performance, proprioceptive acuity, and age in community-dwelling elderly women with knee OA. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 35 elderly women aged 65 years and over, who had a clinical diagnosis of unilateral or bilateral knee OA and were able to walk independently. The volunteers were tested for proprioceptive acuity (joint position sense and kinesthesia) and isokinetic muscular performance of the quadriceps and hamstrings on the isokinetic dynamometer Biodex System 3 Pro\u00ae. Descriptive statistics were carried out for all outcome variables and correlation coefficients were calculated with a significance level of \u03b1\u00a0<\u00a00.05. Results: No significant correlations were found between the measures of muscular performance and proprioceptive acuity. Furthermore, no significant correlations were found between age and measures of strength and proprioception. Conclusions: The results suggested no significant relationships between measures of proprioceptive acuity and muscular performance of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles and, especially, no influences of age on these variables in elderly women with knee OA.",

The dataset used was from the Bangkok Longitudinal Study by Siriraj Hospital for the Older Men and Women (BLOSSOM), which is a community cohort study in Bangkok, Thailand. This analysis is based on the cross-sectional data in the year 2005\u20132006 and includes 5936 participants aged 50 years and over from community settings within six suburban areas in Bangkok. The study found that women had a longer total life expectancy (LE), but had shorter cognitive impairment-free (CIFLE), physical illness-free (PHILE) and disability-free (DIFLE) LEs, than men. However, there was no difference between the life expectancies for living with good SPGH in men and in women. Differences in health expectations might explain this finding. Health promotion and disease prevention should be initiated at a younger age and should target all health domains.",

This study covered 92 PAD enrolled in a cognitive-motor stimulation study. The severity of cognitive impairment ranged from mild cognitive impairment to severe dementia. QoL was measured using the AD-related quality of life (ADRQL) scale. Social and clinical variables (for both PAD and caregiver) as well as other variables relating to cognition, activities of daily living (ADL), behavior, mood and caregiver burden were recorded. Spearman correlation coefficients and multivariate linear regression analysis were used to analyze the correlates of ADRQL (global score and subscores). Behavior and basic ADL were the best predictors of global QoL (coefficient of determination R2\u00a0=\u00a00.57, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005). Cognition contributed marginally to global QoL (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.03, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Patients were divided into two groups as those of \u226565 years old (geriatric group) and those of <65 years old (non-geriatric group). The stroke severity, functional status, and ambulation level were assessed by the Canadian neurological scale (CNS), the functional independence measure (FIM), and the functional ambulation classification scale (FACS) within the first week of stroke, respectively. Depression and QoL levels were also determined at the third month using the Zung self-rating depression scale (ZDS) and both the Short Form-36 (SF-36) survey and the stroke-specific quality of life (SSQoL) scale, respectively. The QoL of 80 patients according to the SF-36 were lower than those of general population. No significant difference was found in stroke severity, functional status at baseline and third month, depression and QoL between geriatric and non-geriatric patients (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The most influenced subscale of QoL was work/productivity in geriatric patients, and the main determinant of QoL was the functional status during the assessment. Stroke patients had an impaired QoL, and geriatric patients did not demonstrate a difference in terms of QoL compared to non-geriatric patients. The fact that the main determinant of QoL was functional status has been suggested that improving of physical function may be helpful to provide a better QoL for stroke patients.",

Gender differences are also explored in the study. This was a cross-sectional face-to-face interview study of 489 community dwelling older adults living in an urban area of Nepal. The data were analyzed using multiple regression models with each dimension of intergenerational solidarity and conflict variables entered one-by-one with the confounding variables. The results illustrate that older women receiving lower emotional and instrumental support were significantly more likely to be depressed compared to older men receiving less support from their son. Also, women reporting lower anticipated support and higher conflict with their son were more likely to be depressed than men. Regarding synergic effects, emotional support exchange buffered against the deleterious effects of conflict with depression in older adults. The results highlight a need for further research on late life intergenerational relationships (IR) and mental health of older adults in developing countries so that it can be useful for health care practitioners.",

Prevalence rates of certain geriatric conditions differed significantly between medical and surgical units, suggesting that care should address not only common conditions but also those with higher rates on different units. Furthermore, high rates of geriatric conditions indicate strong needs for care that does not fit into traditional disease models of medicine.

All patients underwent an analysis of their cardiac functions using a Doppler echo-cardiographic method measuring the ventricular ejection fraction (VEF), as well as the BMD by means of a computerized bone mineralometric DEXA method, performed in vertebral and femoral measurement sites. Both populations proved to be osteopenic, displaying reduced values of BMD. Higher bone mineral losses were measured in the patients who had more severe cardiac insufficiency. The present data revealed a significant reduction of BMD in the N.Y.H.A.

     "abstract": "The relationship between serum albumin level and rehabilitation outcome in older patients has not been fully explored. This study investigated this association in older Chinese patients. We studied 1604 patients in two geriatric convalescence hospitals. Admission albumin levels (g/l) were measured and segregated into three groups: <30\u00a0g/l; 30 to <35\u00a0g/l; \u226535\u00a0g/l. Absolute functional and motor gain were determined by Barthel index (BI) and elderly mobility scale (EMS) and expressed as BI efficacy and EMS efficacy. BI and EMS efficiency were deduced by the efficacy divided by the length of hospital stay (LOS). Satisfactory motor and functional outcomes were defined as discharge EMS\u00a0\u2265\u00a015 and BI\u00a0\u2265\u00a075. Significant improvement in EMS and BI scores across all 3 albumin groups on discharge was observed, with lower scores in low albumin groups. The EMS and BI efficacy were the same in 3 albumin groups. However, EMS and BI efficiency were higher in the high albumin groups. Admission albumin was not independent predictors for satisfactory motor and functional outcomes. For satisfactory motor outcome (EMS\u00a0\u2265\u00a015), female gender (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004), age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0009) and urinary incontinence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0076) were negative predictors while living at home (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0028), admission EMS (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and BI score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004) were positive predictors. For satisfactory functional outcome (BI\u00a0\u2265\u00a075), age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and urinary incontinence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were negative predictors while female gender (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0024), LOS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033), C-MMSE (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), admission EMS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and BI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were positive predictors. Admission albumin levels were related to functional and motor efficiency, but not with absolute functional and motor gain. Albumin was not an independent predictor for satisfactory motor and functional outcome.",

     "abstract": "Low serum albumin may have prognostic value for morbidity and mortality in patients with hip fracture. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the independent association between low serum albumin (<35\u00a0g/l) at hospital admission and short-term (in-hospital) mortality and post-operative complications of patients with hip fracture. We reviewed a prospective population-based cohort of 583 hip fracture patients who had pre-operative albumin values measured at hospital admission in one of the 3 tertiary hospitals in Northern Alberta, Canada. Patients with a primary diagnosis of hip fracture and 65 years or older were included. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and any pre-specified post-operative complication. Mean serum albumin level was 33.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0g/l (\u00b1S.D.), and overall 55% (n\u00a0=\u00a0318) of patients had a low albumin. The in-hospital mortality was 8% (n\u00a0=\u00a046) and rate of any non-fatal post-operative complication rate was 31/100. Mortality was 11% (n\u00a0=\u00a035) among those with low albumin levels and 4% (n\u00a0=\u00a011) for those with normal values (unadjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.86, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.42\u20135.74). After multivariate adjustment, the association between low serum albumin and mortality remained large and statistically significant (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.44, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.17\u20135.12). Low albumin levels were also significantly associated with post-operative medical complications (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.96, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.36\u20132.83). We conclude that routine measurement of serum albumin provides valuable prognostic information for treating this frail population.",

Ninety-two senile patients scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery were selected, whose FC was evaluated in terms of Duke activity status index (DASI). According to FC, the patients were classified into three groups: Group 1 (poor FC); Group 2 (moderate FC) and Group 3 (excellent FC). Heart rate variability (HRV) was monitored during the night before, on the 1st and the 2nd day after operation respectively. The results demonstrated some indices of pre-operative HRV of patients with poor or moderate FC were significantly lower than those with excellent FC. After surgery, total power (TP), high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF) and very low frequency (VLF) of all patients were significantly decreased. The LF/HF of patients with a poor or moderate FC showed a significant difference compared to patients with excellent FC. In conclusion, we emphasize that surgery induced a cardiac autonomic nervous dysfunction in senile patients not only with low FC but also with high FC; the disturbance of pre- and post-operative cardiac autonomic nervous activity is associated with a diminished FC (<7METs\u00a0=\u00a0metabolic equivalents) in senile patients.",

In this study, we aimed to know whether the eight-item test (including three-item recall, attention and calculation, subtracted from the mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clock drawing test (CDT), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairment or any combination of the above tests can be used as a quick and effective dementia screening tool. A total of 188 seniors aged over 60 years were enrolled at a geriatric clinic. The result revealed that a cutoff score of 6/7 in an eight-item scale had a sensitivity of 94.9% and a specificity of 59.1% in the detection of dementia. In terms of sensitivity and specificity, the eight-item scale performed better than a score of two in three-item recall (51.3%/87.3%), a score of one in three-item recall (83.3%/53.6%), CDT (39.0%/96.9%), mini-cognitive assessment instrument (Mini-Cog) test (53.7%/95.5%), a score of less than three in attention/calculation test (74.7%/77.3%), impairment of transportation or medication in IADL (67.2%/90.6%), and any impairment in IADL (77.2%/67.9%). In subgroup analysis, a cutoff score of 5/6 were adjusted for the low-education group.

Several reports have suggested that quetiapine also may have antidepressant properties. The present study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine augmentation in depressed elderly patients previously unresponsive to a full course of treatment. Medical charts of elderly depressed inpatients treated at a tertiary care psychiatric center during a 3-year period were reviewed. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from computerized records and analyzed. The primary outcome measure was the change on the clinical global impressions scale for improvement (CGI-I). Twenty depressed elderly inpatients received quetiapine augmentation during the study period. Prior to augmentation all had been treated with antidepressants. Baseline mean severity of depression was 6.40; severity after augmentation was significantly reduced to 3.25; the change in CGI-I was 2.10 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.03). Mean quetiapine dose was 70\u00a0mg; mean duration of augmentation was 3.9 weeks. Five patients complained of somnolence. One patient discontinued psycho-tropics and switched to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) due to life-threatening suicidal tendencies. We tentatively conclude that quetiapine augmentation for elderly depressed patients unresponsive to standard antidepressant treatment may be a safe and efficacious option.

     "abstract": "Qualitative and quantitative modifications of receptors were shown to play a key role in cell and tissue aging. We recently described the properties of a rhamnose-recognizing receptor on fibroblasts involved in the mediation of age-dependent functions of these cells. Using Ca2+-mobilization and DNA-microarrays we could show in the presence of rhamnose-rich oligo- and polysaccharides (RROPs) Ca2+-mobilization and changes in gene regulation. Here, we compared the effects of several RROPs, differing in their carbohydrate sequence and molecular weights, in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs). It appeared that different structural features were required for maximal effects on Ca2+-mobilization and gene-expression profiles. Maximal effect on Ca2+ influx and intracellular free calcium regulation was exhibited by RROP-1, a 50\u00a0kDa average molecular weight polysaccharide, and RROP-3, a 5\u00a0kDa average molecular weight oligosaccharide with a different carbohydrate sequence. Maximal effect on gene-expression profiles was obtained with RROP-3. These results suggest the possibility of several different transmission pathways from the rhamnose-receptor to intracellular targets, differentially affecting these two intracellular functions, with potential consequences on aging. Although of only relative specificity, this receptor site exhibits a high affinity for rhamnose, absent from vertebrate glycoconjugates. The rhamnose-receptor might well represent an evolutionary conserved conformation of a prokaryote lectin.",

     "abstract": "The changing social and economic conditions and the increase of the life span induced a progressive increase of the general prevalence of DMT2, particularly in the elderly population of the highly evoluted countries. Up to now 18 genetic loci have been identified, each of them consisting of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The evidence that the DMT2 is regulated by a high number of genes, demonstrate the pathogenetic complexity of this disease. The onset of diabetes mellitus (DM) in medium age is a consequence of the breakdown of the glycemic homeostasis in correlation with the genetic factors, such as the variants of the TCF7L2, obesity, etc., and the environmental factors, such as the life-style, the evolution of chronic-degenerative diseases, etc. In case of DM that onsets in old age we have to add the deterioration of the anti-aging defense mechanisms, characterized by the antagonistic action of the genes of longevity and aging. One can observe several clinical and therapeutic differences; therefore, the authors of this review propose the reinsertion of three forms into the DMT2 correlated with the age of onset and with the actual age of the subjects: the maturity onset diabetes (MOD), the maturity onset diabetes in elderly (MODE), and the senile diabetes (DS).",

     "abstract": "Abdominal obesity plays a significant role in cardiometabolic health. Due to the difficulties to quantify abdominal obesity, a number of proxy indicators have been developed, including waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip (WTH) ratio, and waist-to-height (WHtR) ratio. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of WHtR predicting new onset diabetes mellitus (NOD) among older adults in rural Taiwan. In 2000, 372 subjects (mean age\u00a0=\u00a061.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.3 years, 57.8% females) living in the Tou-Cheng Township of I-Lan County participated in the study and 250 of them (6 deceased, mean age of survivors\u00a0=\u00a067.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.7 years, 58.9% females) were successfully followed in 2005. The mean BMI of the primary cohort was 25.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0kg/m2; the proportion of obesity and overweight was 47.8% and 21.0%, respectively. The mean WHtR was 0.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07, and the prevalence of high WHtR (>0.5) was 83.9%. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) was 18.5% and 19.6%, respectively. Comparisons between subjects with high WHtR (>0.5) and low WHtR (<0.5) showed significant cardiovascular risk factor clustering in high WHtR group, but serum cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol similar in both groups. In 2005, the prevalence of DM and IFG among 244 survivors was 24.9% and 24.1%, respectively. Overall, the cumulative incidence of NOD during the 5-year follow-up was 8.2% (20/244), which was 8.7% (18/206) in high WHtR group and 5.3% (2/38) in low WHtR group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.489). Adjusted for age and sex, IFG was the only independent risk factor for NOD in this study (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a0OR\u00a0=\u00a09.21, 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a0CI\u00a0=\u00a02.70\u201331.46), but not the high WHtR. In conclusion, high WHtR is a common phenomenon (83.9%) of community-living older adults in rural Taiwan and it did not predict significantly NOD in 5-year follow-up. Further investigations are needed to evaluate the predictability of WHtR in NOD among older adults and to compare the effectiveness of WHtR with other conventional risk factors.",

Linear regression analysis showed that ANSS were associated with the discharge walking FIM scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and rehabilitation length (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027) independent of age, admission albumin serum levels, gender, type of hip surgery, and the appearance of pressure sores. We conclude that the Norton scoring system may be used for predicting the outcome and the duration of rehabilitation in elderly patients following hip arthroplasty.",

The postural stability during bipedal quiet standing was tested directly before and after 10-min of exercise on a cycloergometer. The level of exercise intensity was predefined on the basis of subject's heart rate (HR). The study demonstrated that only small fractions of variation in post-exercise values of path length and area 95% could be explained by SPB at rest by the application of linear model (R2\u00a0=\u00a05.3%, or 10.8%, respectively). The application of non-linear model, graphically represented by a parabola, revealed that the percentages of variations in path length and area 95% which could be explained by the systolic blood pressure (SBP) at rest amounted to 24.1% and 36.6%, respectively. Therefore, lower or higher values of SBP are related to the risk of increased path length and area 95%, which in turn are reflected in a temporary decrease in postural stability.",

     "abstract": "Unexplained unintentional weight loss (UUWL) is a common health problem in older adults, and raises significant diagnostic challenges. Currently, there is no consensus or guideline to help physicians approach these patients. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate physicians\u2019 behaviors in evaluating elderly patients with UUWL and to compare the diagnostic strategy of internists and geriatricians. From January of 2008 to December of 2009, medical records of all elderly patients admitted to Taipei Veterans General Hospital with UUWL were obtained for study. All diagnostic procedures used during admissions were evaluated and the final diagnosis for each patient was obtained. Overall, data of 136 patients (mean age: 79.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3 years, 80.9% males) were obtained for study with their mean weight loss of 8.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4\u00a0kg. Among them, 79 (58.1%) patients were admitted to the geriatric evaluation and management unit (GEMU) and 57 (41.9%) patients were admitted to the general medical wards. There were no statistically significant differences in terms of age, sex, mean age and average weight loss between these two groups. After extensive diagnostic effort, the most common diagnostic entity was benign organic disease (33.8%), followed by unknown (25.7%), neuropsychiatric disorder (23.5%), and malignancy (16.9%). Tumor markers are commonly used, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (80.9%), prostate specific antigen (PSA) (81.8%), and carbohydrate 19-9 (CA 19-9) (65.4%). Imaging studies were also commonly used diagnostic tools, including gastrointestinal endoscopy (70.6%), colonoscopy (42.6%) and computerized tomography (44.1%). Compared with internists, geriatricians were more likely to order PSA testing (70.5% vs. 89.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.021). In contrast, internists were more likely to order CA-199 (75.4%% vs. 58.2%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.045), and to arrange gastrointestinal endoscopy than geriatricians (82.4% vs. 62.0%%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). In conclusion, cancer accounts for only 16.9% of all elderly patients with UUWL in this study, tumor markers are very commonly used for screening of occult cancer. Compared with internists, geriatricians are more likely to order PSA and to establish neuropsychiatric diagnosis, and internists are more prone to order carbohydrate (CA 19-9) and gastrointestinal endoscopy.",

To achieve such an object, the current study was developed in an experimental format or design, comprised of a sample group of 23 elderly subjects, of both genders, undergoing evaluation by the phonoaudiology protocol for evaluating the risk of dysphagia (abbreviated from the Portuguese name: Protocolo de Avalia\u00e7\u00e3o do Risco para Disfagia\u00a0=\u00a0PARD), pre- and post-intervention procedure. The developed program used the indirect therapy approach based on the adaptive myotherapeutic and myofunctional stimulation, contemplating two isometric and isokinetic orofacial active myotherapeutic exercises, two passive myotherapeutic manipulations for the supra-hyoidal musculature, as well as adaptive cephalic postural maneuvres, associated to the intra-oral olfactive and gustative sensory stimulation. The evolution of the individuals was analyzed before and after the therapy by estimating the capacity of swallowing food in the liquid fluid (LF) consistency, by the paired Student t-test, giving a p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, making the difference of 2.31 between the 2 evaluations statistically significant.

Results showed increased response times and decreased correct responses in interference, as compared to initiation. As interference increased, older adults demonstrated lower accuracy than younger ones. Further, low spans demonstrated higher interference costs than high spans on accuracy, while the reverse pattern was found for response times.

We investigated among older adults (i) the prevalence of hearing difficulty, (ii) the association of hearing difficulty with a composite outcome of dependence in activities of daily living (ADL) and death, and (iii) the population attributable risk fraction (PAF) of hearing difficulty. In 2005, a home-visit survey of 1364 Japanese older adults aged \u226565 (participation proportion\u00a0=\u00a095.5%) was conducted to evaluate self-reports of hearing difficulty. Over 3 years, 99.4% of the initial sample was followed. Outcomes were measured by incidence of death or dependence in ADL. In the sample, the prevalence of hearing difficulty was 17.7% (age \u226565) and 25.7% (age \u226575). Hearing difficulty at high levels was associated with a composite outcome of dependence in ADL and mortality (adjusted odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a0OR and 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a095% CI\u00a0=\u00a06.19 (1.92\u201319.92)) as well as with each outcome independently. Improving the hearing difficulty from high to moderate or no difficulty would reduce the composite outcome in 4.3% (age \u226565) and in 6.3% (age \u226575) of the target population.

An observational study was performed on elderly patients admitted to the Hospital Network of the Italian National Research Center on Aging (INRCA) from January 2005 to December 2006. Depression was defined according to 15-item geriatric depression scale (GDS) score; physical disability according to activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) scores; cognitive impairment on the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test; the number and severity of comorbidities by means of physician-administered cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS).

Both depression and hypertension remained significantly associated with functional disability and cognitive impairment. When controlling for age, gender, the number and severity of comorbidities, hypertension was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of having functional disability or cognitive impairment only in the presence of depression (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a0OR\u00a0=\u00a02.02, 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a095%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.60\u20132.54, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for functional disability; OR\u00a0=\u00a02.21, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.79\u20132.74, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for cognitive impairment) as compared to normotensive controls without depression.

The prevalence rate of six neuropsychiatric syndromes (depressive symptoms, inertia, vegetative symptoms, irritability/aggression, behavioral dysregulation, psychotic symptoms) and comorbid neuropsychiatric syndromes were calculated according to the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. To investigate the relationship among neuropsychiatric syndromes, logistic regression analyses were performed. About 95% of patients with AD had one or more neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes during the past month. Among the neuropsychiatric syndromes, irritability/aggression (76.2%) was the most frequent, followed by apathy (72.3%) and depressive symptoms (68.0%).

We conducted a retrospective chart review of new patients between 1/06 and 8/07 who were diagnosed with dementia or cognitive impairment in a geriatric outpatient practice. The data collected included age, gender, tobacco use patterns and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score. Data was analyzed using SAS 9.1 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Former tobacco use rates in our study were similar to nationwide published rates for elderly over 65 (39.9% vs. 39.5%, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.99). However, only two patients in our study (1.32%, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.16\u20134.70) were current tobacco users compared with published census data that 10.2% of those over 65 are current smokers nationwide (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Our study revealed a much lower rate of current tobacco use in our series of cognitively impaired patients. Further research is needed to explore the reasons for decreased smoking in those with cognitive impairment and its clinical implications.",

This research is based on the representative sample (N\u00a0=\u00a0114,873) of seniors over 65 years nationwide. The CCI by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and clinical classifications software (CCS) were adopted to determine chronic condition diagnosis codes and classify the diseases. The results are presented by descriptive and multiple regression analysis. The chronic condition prevalence for seniors is 70.4% and the medical expenditures for seniors with chronic conditions accounts for 92.7% of the total medical expenditures for seniors, while 25% of the medical expenditure is spent on 8.2% of seniors who have five chronic conditions and above. Chronic conditions suffered by the elderly, in the order of its prevalence, are hypertension (36.1%), COPD (23.7%), and cataracts (16.7%). From the viewpoint of annual average medical expenditures, cardiovascular diseases rank the most costly diseases, with average medical expenditures as high as $4291. Urinary disease and diabetes ranks the second and the third most costly with an average expenditure of $3644 and $3594. This research showed that the average medical expenditure for seniors with chronic conditions is 5.4 times higher compared with seniors without chronic conditions. It is recommended to further study the characteristics of the target population that spends the most in medical expenditures to outline a more beneficial disease management model, reduce avoidable medical costs and achieve the goal of saving medical resources.",

     "abstract": "The aim was to explore the relationship between health care utilization over 2 years and psychosocial variables measured at the end of this period in a sample of older people with high health care consumption. Sixty-three people aged 69\u201396 years were included in the study. Data were collected from two different registers covering health care utilization from 2004 to the end of 2008, and baseline data from an ongoing RCT. A cluster analysis (based on the health care utilization variables) was used to divide the sample into subgroups. The cluster analysis resulted in a two cluster and a three cluster solutions. The latter was found to be more appropriate because it more clearly discriminated between the groups regarding health care utilization and psychosocial variables. The three clusters were classified as \u201chigh consumers\u201d (Cluster I), and \u201clow consumers\u201d (Clusters II and III). Cluster II seemed to be characterized by low outpatient but high inpatient care utilization, while the opposite utilization pattern can be seen in Cluster III, which also contained those with the largest social network, lowest risk of depression, highest life satisfaction and who felt least lonely. Cluster II contained those who felt the loneliest. Thus, older people whose health care consumption mainly comprises outpatient care appeared to have the least impact on the psychosocial variables (e.g., the highest life satisfaction, felt least lonely and were at the lowest risk of depression). Thus, measures taken to prevent health care utilization, especially among those with high utilization of inpatient care, will most likely have a positive effect on psychosocial variables and life satisfaction/quality of life (QoL).",

The present study aimed to identify factors associated with lower physical activity in elderly caregivers of demented patients. A cross-sectional survey of 50 elderly caregivers living with patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's-type dementia showed that the Zarit caregiver burden interview (ZBI) scores were significant predictors of physical activity measured by the questionnaire score (QS) of physical activities. Among the three subscales of the QS, it was only leisure time activity scores (LS) that the ZBI scores significantly predicted. The numbers of chronic diseases were associated with lower household activity scores (HS) and sport activities scores (SS). Physical activities, in particular leisure activities, were found to be inversely associated with care burden assessed by the ZBI. Interventions to increase the physical activity levels of older caregivers may improve their health status and quality of life.",

Ninety-three older (\u226565 years old) subjects who use canes for daily activities were recruited from four assisted living facilities and five retirement centers for this cross-sectional study. The assessment involved interviewing cane users with a questionnaire, examining their canes, and investigating how these canes were used by their owners during ambulation. The commonly used canes are (from most to least): adjustable single-tip, un-adjustable (wooden), small quad, and large quad. Five major problems from data analysis were identified: lack of medical consultation for device selection/use, incorrect cane height/maintenance, placement of cane in improper hand, inability to maintain the proper reciprocal gait pattern, and improper posture during ambulation. Only forward-leaning posture during ambulation might be associated with increased falls among the older cane users. Knowledge of these problems could assist health professionals to implement appropriate interventions in clinical settings and to provide community service to address all problems related to cane use.",

The aim of the EPEPP-1 (abbreviated from the Portuguese name: Estudo do Perfil de Envelhecimento da Popula\u00e7\u00e3o Portuguesa) study was to characterize the socio-demographic components of the elderly Portuguese population in order to disclose factors that could play a role in the aging process and in the elderly QoL. This observational descriptive study, was performed in 2672 individuals older than 54 years taking into account gender and the residence area (rural vs. urban). A questionnaire about social network (marital status, living alone, the hours spent alone, confidents), and social status (education, occupation) was applied. Social network score revealed significant age and gender trends, women and older people performing worst, but with no difference according to residence area. Almost a third was unmarried and spent eight or more hours per day alone, and a fifth lived alone. Social status revealed that being older female and resident in a rural area quoted worst in the prevalence of illiteracy and undifferentiated occupation. The authors concluded that social isolation, illiteracy and undifferentiated occupation are prevalent in Portuguese older population. Identification of further determinants of isolation, adjustment of procedures to be included in social networks and development of actions directed to education are important fields of intervention influencing the elderly QoL.",

After personal invitation, 12 older women, participated in the study. Volunteers performed maximal voluntary isometric knee extension and flexion contractions (MVC) where the RFD was determined (considering the first 50, 100 and 200\u00a0ms after the force production onset; also, the time necessary to achieve 30% and 50% MVC was considered). Electromyography data from quadriceps and hamstrings were used to determine different CA indexes (CAIs). A correlation test was applied between CAI and RFD; different methods to determine CAI were also compared (Wilcoxon test). The CAI determination methods were not different one from another (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) and were significantly correlated with RFD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in special, when time to achieve 30% MVC and 50% MVC were considered (|r|\u00a0=\u00a00.89 and r2\u00a0=\u00a00.79; |r|\u00a0=\u00a00.93 and r2\u00a0=\u00a00.86; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

A total of 197 persons with stroke were assessed 3 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after discharge from an acute care hospital, rehabilitation unit or geriatric day hospital. The Assessment of Life Habits (ALH) was used to measure participation. Neuropsychological measures were used to assess the presence of a cognitive deficit in the domains of memory, visual perception, executive functions (inhibition), visual attention and language. Overall, results indicate that participation after a stroke improves over time after hospital discharge in spite of cognitive deficits. Changes in participation over time differed between unimpaired and impaired participants only for language and executive deficits in three domains: interpersonal relationships, community life and responsibilities. These results indicate that when returning to the community after a stroke, positive changes in participation over time are possible even with cognitive deficits.",

This study aimed to determine the effects of vascular risk factors, such as blood pressure, diabetes and smoking in the mid-life or the late-life on dementia risk. The data in this prospective cohort study came from 3252 dementia events occurring over 14 years among 848,505 Koreans aged 40\u201395 years insured by the National Health Insurance Corporation who had a biennial medical evaluation during 1992\u20131995. Data on clinical dementia during the period 1993\u20132006 were examined in relation to vascular risk factors. The age adjusted incidence per 100,000 was 31.9 for men and 45.0 for women, respectively. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, diabetes increased the risk of either dementia in Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia in men and women, controlling for age, hypertension, total cholesterol, alcohol drinking, and smoking. Hypertension also increased vascular dementia in both men [Hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a02.6, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.7\u20133.8] and women (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.3, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.6\u20133.3). The association of hypertension or diabetes on risk of vascular dementia, however, among the group aged older than 65 was attenuated but remained as significant in men. There was no interaction between hypertension and diabetes on the risk of dementia. This study demonstrates that diabetes and hypertension increased the risk of vascular dementia. Treatment for these risk factors may reduce the risk of vascular dementia.",

Knowledge on the effectiveness of rehabilitative procedures is needed and information in physical performance between men and women is scarce. An intervention study was carried out in two war veterans\u2019 rehabilitation centers in Finland to examine the effects of geriatric inpatient rehabilitation on physical performance and pain in elderly men and women. The study included 441 community-dwelling persons with a mean age of 83 years. A clinical assessment and a structured interview were carried out. Cognitive capacity was evaluated with the mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Physical performance was measured through several validated tests. Pain was measured with the visual analogy scale (VAS). The rehabilitation was carried out with the standard rehabilitation protocol. Both men and women showed a statistically significant improvement in physical performance tests. The experience of pain and disease symptoms diminished significantly in both sexes (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The intervention showed that women improved more than men.

Inpatient geriatric rehabilitation appeared to have a positive effect on physical performance and the experience of pain in elderly people. The differences between the sexes in the experience of pain, disease symptoms and in the knee extension strength could provide a new perspective in the planning of more individual rehabilitation interventions.",

Logistic regression analysis showed that GP more often diagnosed depression in older patients, provided medical care for them and changed their therapy. The main therapy for up to 80% of elderly with diagnosis of recurrent depressive disorder was combination of pharmacotherapy and GP's support and psychiatrist psychotherapy, while more than 20% of elderly with diagnosis of depressive episode took only pharmacotherapy. In comparison with younger age group, elderly less frequently received psychotherapy and GP's support. GP has an important role in older depressed patient care, so improvement efforts could focus on GP's clinical skills of depression treatment, as well as therapy effectiveness and depression outcome for understanding treatment specificity within elderly.",

The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale was used to measure the extent of depressive symptoms. Socioeconomic indicators included education, household income, and net worth. Analyses were conducted by gender, using multiple linear regression analysis, to identify independent effects of socioeconomic variables on depressive symptoms, controlling for demographics and health-related variables. There was an inverse association between higher levels of socioeconomic factors and depressive symptoms in the study population. A clear difference in the association between depressive symptoms and socioeconomic factors by gender was observed. In the multivariate analysis, wealth was significantly associated with depressive symptoms in men, whereas education and income was so in women. Gender disparities in depressive symptoms across social gradients suggest the need for gender-sensitive investments in health and social services for the disadvantaged segments of the older population.",

The aim of the study was to compare levels of functioning, depression and anxiety in post PFO closure patients following cryptogenic CVA/TIA and in other patients post CVA/TIA without PFO. Eighty-nine patients who had undergone trans-catheter PFO closure and 56 non-PFO post-CVA patients completed demographic, functioning, anxiety and depression questionnaires. Additional medical data were recorded from the medical files. Patients who had undergone trans-catheter PFO closure post CVA or TIA reported better level of functioning and substantially lower levels of depression and anxiety. The 70% of depression and 55% of anxiety variances were explained by female gender, older age, lower education, lower functioning level and additional health problems. Functioning level was the strongest contributor to the explained variance of psychological symptoms.

Personal, medical, cognitive and functional data, biochemical parameters, preoperative medications, conduct of surgery and anesthesia and details of hemodynamic control were collected as predictors of delirium. After surgery, the subjects were divided on the basis of delirium onset within a week observation period. Delirium was diagnosed by the Confusion Assessment Method. Delirium started the first post-operative day (2F; 6\u00a0M) and lasted 3.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 days. Subjects with POD were significantly older, had a previous history of delirium, were more impaired in the instrumental activities of daily living and had poorer clock drawing test (CDT) score. Interestingly, a significantly greater number of hypotensive events were recorded during anesthesia. Age, cognitive and functional status, previous history of delirium and hypotensive episodes intrasurgery are the best predictor of POD in this setting.

The results of CDS for the study group were running at high level and were dependent on the marital status and age. No impact of gender, place of residence, education, material situation and disease duration was revealed. Similarly, FACIT-F scores were higher for married patients than for widowed ones, and they were age-dependent. Most of CDS scores were at a high level, which means that the investigated patients were, to a limited extent, care-dependent in meeting their needs. In the majority of subjects, the level of daily activities was high, which proves an independent functioning. Results of CDS were dependent on FACIT-F scores in the study group.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency, features, and factors for falls affecting subacute stroke patients hospitalized for rehabilitation. Ninety-nine subacute stroke patients, hospitalized for rehabilitation were evaluated prospectively in this study. All patients were evaluated using the functional independence measurement (FIM), the Barthel index (BI), the Berg balance scale (BBS), the mini mental state examination (MMSE), the hospital anxiety depression scale (HADS), and the Downton index (DI), performed by the same physician. Proximal femur bone mineral density (BMD) measurements were performed using the dual-energy X-ray absorbtiometry (DXA). During the period of hospitalization, 17 patients (17.2%) reported falling once. The calculated incidence rate for falls was 6.3/1000 hospital days (95% confidence interval, CI\u00a0=\u00a03.7\u201310.1). Furthermore, 41% of the falls occurred in patients\u2019 rooms, 82% between the hours 06:00\u2013 20:00, 47% while walking and 65% on the side affected from the stroke. Despite the fact that 30% of the patients had osteoporosis, no fractures were observed after these falls, 88% had only soft tissue injury. Overall, 88% of the patients reported they had a fear for falling. Admission DI scores were significantly lower in the group of patients with no falls compared to the group with falls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Falls occurred most frequently during daytime, while subacute stroke patients were walking. DI is useful in stroke patients that are to be hospitalized for rehabilitation and accordingly, preventive action taken on those patients with a high risk for falls.",

This study examined if leg muscle strength correlates to functional balance and mobility among geriatric inpatients. Fifty inpatients, 29 women and 21 men (mean age 79.6 years) were included. Functional balance was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and mobility was assessed with the Physiotherapy Clinical Outcome Variable Scale (COVS). Strength in the leg extension muscles was measured as 1 Repetition Maximum (1RM) in a leg press and strength in the ankle muscles was measured with Medical Research Council grades (MRC, 0\u20135). The sum scores, and most of the single items, of the BBS and the COVS significantly correlated to 1RM/body weight, ankle dorsiflexion, and plantar flexion. In a stepwise multiple regression, ankle dorsiflexion and 1RM/body weight together accounted for 39% of the variance of the BBS and 41% of the variance of the COVS. Estimated values of the BBS and the COVS can be calculated from the equation. In clinical work, the knowledge about how leg muscle strength associates with balance and mobility may be useful in analyzing underlying causes of reduced balance and mobility function, and in planning rehabilitation programs.",

These deficits have typically been measured using tests of fluid cognition, which involve the active processing of mental representations. However, the effects of delirium on stored, crystallized dimensions of cognition, such as well-learnt word pronunciation knowledge, are not known. In this study 37 patients (aged 60\u201385 years) without delirium were recruited before undergoing cardiac surgery. Cognitive assessments were performed 0\u20138 days before surgery and again 2\u20139 days after surgery in order to determine the effects of post-operative delirium (POD) on fluid and crystallized aspects of cognition. Crystallized cognition was tested with the National Adult Reading Test (NART). Fluid cognition was tested with digit span, verbal fluency and Stroop tests. Nine patients (24%) developed delirium post-operatively. Patients with delirium showed significant post-operative deficits on most tests of fluid cognition, but no change in the NART measure of crystallized cognition (p\u00a0=\u00a00.95). These results parallel recent findings in Alzheimer's dementia and suggest that, despite showing extensive deficits of fluid cognitive processing, crystallized cognition is preserved in delirium. The results also suggest that the NART may be a useful tool for assessing premorbid ability in patients with delirium.",

Traditionally, diagnosis of NAFLD is dependent on liver biopsy, but the heterogeneous fatty infiltration may confound the diagnosis. The main purpose of this study was to introduce an experimental method to quantify hepatic steatosis in rats, and to provide an alternative experimental model in following researches. Twenty male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats (6-week-old) randomly divided into two groups and were fed by the commercial chow diet and the choline/methionine deficient (CMD) diet for 2 weeks. All rats underwent a complete morphological measurements and blood biochemistry studies at the beginning of study and 2 weeks later. Two Chinese acupuncture needles were inserted percutaneously into the liver of each rat under general anesthesia for bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA). The acupuncture needles were carefully wrapped by non-conducting sheathes, and were inserted at left subcostal margin and the lower limb of the left rib with the depth of 0.5\u00a0cm. All rats were sacrificed with their livers isolated, sampled, sliced and well prepared after BIA measurements were completed. All pathological specimens were interpreted by one single hepatopathologist. With similar weight in the beginning of study, CMD rats were significantly lighter in weight, but had significantly higher liver weight/body weight ratio (5.5% (4.5\u20136.7%) vs. 4.6% (4.2\u20135.7%), p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) 2 weeks later.

This study constructed a predictive model for discrimination between individuals at a higher risk of depression and normal subjects in Japanese community-dwelling elderly persons, using linear discriminant analysis. Data were collected from 754 non-institutionalized elderly men and women aged 65 years and older living in the community in Japan, using face-to-face interviews in 2002. Stepwise linear discrimination analysis was used to construct a predictive model to select individuals who have a higher risk of depression. The stepwise discriminant analysis selected the five predictor variables (frequent hearing problems, poor appetite, less financial leeway, low emotional support and less subjective usefulness) and yielded a statistically significant function (\u03bb\u00a0=\u00a00.816; \u03c72\u00a0=\u00a0113.0, df\u00a0=\u00a05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This function showed that the rate of correct prediction was 78.2% for depressed. The calculated discriminate function based on the above five predictor variables (hearing problem, less appetite, less financial leeway, low emotional support and less subjective usefulness) is useful for detecting individuals at high risk of depression and preventing its development among community-dwelling elderly persons. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the validity and feasibility of the model for earlier screening for depression among such people.",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was at estimating the effective impact of the environmental pollution on the health state of the subjects residing in highly industrialized areas. For this purpose, we compared 2 populations over the age of 56 years, one from the industrialized areas and the other of agricultural character. The health indicator we utilized was the rate of hospitalization calculated for the main geriatric pathologies. It has been observed that among the residents of highly polluted areas, the hospitalizations were more frequent for the screened pathologies. This finding could be an indicator of an interference of the environmental pollution with the physiological process of aging. One can also suspect that for the cardiovascular pathologies also the factor of physical fatigue being more prevalent in the rural population might play an important role in the high occurrence of this type of diseases. On the basis of these findings we intend to emphasize that the sanitary programs of a given territory should consider in the development and application of a sanitary service the intrinsic characteristics of the given area, when designing the possibly most adequate health care service.",

We enrolled 24 stable amnesics who did not develop dementia after two years follow-up; 27 patients were considered as Prd-AD, in the initial visit, since they fulfilled NINCDS-ADRDA criteria after two years; 31 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 27 controls (CTR). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as a neuropsychological battery was performed at the initial visit. The key findings were: Prd-AD patients were characterized by prominent episodic memory dysfunction and minimal semantic memory and executive dysfunction. Semantic fluency test (Sem-Flu), delayed text memory test (Del-text-mem) and memory alteration test (M@T) (including both episodic and semantic memory), together with trail making test A (TMT-A), resulted significant predictors for dementia development in this group of amnesic patients. This optimal predictive model obtained an estimated accuracy of 53% after two years follow-up. M@T and semantic Sem-Flu test performance presented high correlation with decreased gray matter density in the left lateral temporal lobe. We conclude that Prd-AD is characterized by prominent episodic memory dysfunction and minimal semantic memory and executive dysfunction which are related with left medial, inferior and lateral temporal density loss, predominantly in the left side.",

Impaired dental status and chewing difficulties did not affect the frequency of eating meat and other \u201cdifficult to chew\u201d food, but it was related to more frequent consumption of softer food (chicken, fish, grains, and dairy products). The older Greeks did not exclude any food type from their diet, because of dental impairment. To overcome chewing problems they used various preparing methods to consume their favorite food.

A few respondents felt the need for information on public long-term care insurance services. Nearly half of the caregivers were interested in food and nutrition. The respondents were more likely to receive information from their care managers or physicians than any other source. Caregivers of elderly dependents with severe dementia reported a greater need for information on the spread of dementia, dementia-specific care, or the negative effects of dementia on family and neighborhood.

Pearson correlation analysis was used to assess the relationship between 6MWD, resting cardiovascular function and CVDRF. To examine the shared variance between 6MWD, cardiac function, and CVDRF, linear regression analyses were employed. Inverse associations were observed between 6MWD and age (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.405; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), percent body fat (%BF) (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.472; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), trunk fat (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.234; p\u00a0=\u00a00.020), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.307; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), HRrest (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.248; p\u00a0=\u00a00.013), and RPPrest (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.400; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Quantitative and qualitative data from 404 family caregivers were analyzed using binary logistic regression analysis and content analysis.

Utilization of home nursing is also predicted by the age of the family caregiver. Punctuality of the staff is the dominant quality criterion. Hence, in order to reduce the number of those Alzheimer's disease (AD) caregivers who think they don\u2019t need home nursing or home help compared with the number who really don\u2019t need it, caregivers should be transparently informed of the relevant advantages and quality principles of using home nursing respectively home help.",

The study explored clinical and socio-demographic predictors of functional status decline. Data from the SIPA 3-year longitudinal study were analyzed (n\u00a0=\u00a01164). Three categories of functional status were defined: no important disability, significant IADL disability and significant ADL disability. At baseline, results show that the prevalence rates were 26.9%, 58.6% and 14.5% for the three categories of functional status. After 12 months, about 50\u201360% of participants had remained in the same status, while some 10\u201315% of those with baseline significant disability had improved. The patterns of transitions between 12 and 36 months of follow-up were slightly different. The results indicated more deterioration (13\u201338%) and less improvement (6\u20139%). After controlling for baseline functional status, the best predictors for functional decline at 36 months were prior disability, functional limitations, cognitive impairment and comorbidity burden. We found that older adults\u2019 functional status may decline or improve even if the participants are disabled. Disabled conditions play a crucial role in the development of future disability and preventive actions need to be implemented.",

We performed a 6-month prospective, observational, multicenter study of the progression of cognitive and functionality abilities in a large sample patients with AD who initiated treatment with donepezil in monotherapy. According to baseline mini mental state examination (MMSE), patients were divided in two groups: mild AD (MMSE\u00a0\u2265\u00a021) and moderate AD (MMSE\u00a0<\u00a021). Patients were evaluated with the memory alteration test (M@T) and the Alzheimer's disease functional assessment and change scale (ADFACS) at baseline and at 6 months. A total of 403 patients finished the study (mild AD\u00a0=\u00a0152; moderate AD\u00a0=\u00a0251). The MMSE total score and M@T score remained stable at 6 months in the whole sample, with MMSE memory domain and M@T free and cued recall domains improving significantly from baseline. Total ADFACS, instrumental (IADL) and basic activities of daily living (BADL) got significantly worse, with the worsening being significantly greater in the moderate AD group. Significant differences between the groups favoring mild AD were observed for MMSE memory, orientation and language domains, M@T temporal orientation and semantic memory domains, and for IADL. We concluded that in AD patients on donepezil, cognition remains stable at 6 months. The beneficial effect of donepezil treatment, in terms of cognition and functionality, is greater for mild than for moderate AD.",

An experimental laboratory study was undertaken measuring heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and oxygen saturation when 26 active people aged 60 years and over adopted five standardized body positions. Measurements were taken every 2\u00a0min over a 10-min period in sitting, right side lying, left side lying, supine and supine with the head 20\u00b0 below the level of the body. Rate pressure product and mean arterial pressure were calculated. Smoking history, medication use, health conditions and activity level were recorded. Height, weight and body fat were measured. Left and right side lying produced significantly lower diastolic and systolic blood pressure, rate pressure product and mean arterial pressure than supine with the head down. Excluding oxygen saturation mean values for all variables remained within recommended normal limits in all positions. Significant differences in cardio-respiratory variables occur when active older people change body position. Positioning as a treatment intervention appears safe in supine, side lying and sitting for this population. Head down supine position should be adopted with caution.",

We defined absolute functional and motor gains as Barthel Index (BI) efficacy and Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS) efficacy while BI and EMS efficiency were efficacy divided by the length of stay. Satisfactory motor and functional outcomes were defined as discharge EMS\u00a0\u2265\u00a015 and BI\u00a0\u2265\u00a075. Compared with men, women had higher BI but lower EMS on admission and discharge. EMS and BI efficacy and efficiency were similar in both sexes.

A further concern was with how perceived atmosphere in the formative environment was reflected in depression, anxiety and loneliness in old age. The first phase of the study took place in 1988 when interviews were conducted with 635 persons (241 men and 394 women). Depression and anxiety were assessed using the Finnish modified version of Beck's 13-item depression scale (RBDI), which was completed fully by 74% of the interviewees. Loneliness was assessed with a single four category item. In the second phase of the study in 1996, interviews were conducted with 410 persons, of whom 94% filled the RBDI questionnaire. In the third phase in 2004, the number of interviewees was 220 and the response rate 82%. There were no significant changes in the number of people with depressive symptomatology and anxiety, except in 1996 when the proportion of men with mild and moderate depression almost doubled. The number of men and women who felt lonely increased significantly during the 16-year follow-up. People who said they were lonely also had more depression and anxiety than others. People who had grown up in warm and safe environment were the most balanced mentally. The presence or absence of warmth and safety in the formative environment is reflected in mental well-being even at a very old age.",

Twenty-eight young adults (of mean age\u00a0=\u00a020.7 years) and 28 older adults (68.5 years) completed the metamemory in adulthood (MIA) scale for assessing various metamemory dimensions. Compared with young adults, older adults used more external strategy. They used more internal strategy but only those with high depressive symptoms or high routinization. Older adults also reported a less efficient memory than young adults, showing less capacity and more change. In addition, depressive symptoms influenced many MIA subscales: participants with high depressive symptoms reported more external strategy use, less capacity, more change and less locus than participants with low depressive symptoms. Finally, highly routinized participants reported more use of external strategy and experienced more anxiety about memory. These results confirm the impact of aging on metamemory and show that an increase in depressive symptoms even without a depressive state and routinization also influences metamemory. This study shows the need to consider variables that modify memory perception during aging.",

Categories of physical activity level were defined by tertiles of MBQOA scores. Glucose intolerance in subjects not previously diagnosed with diabetes was categorized according to 2003 American Diabetes Association criteria. After adjustment for potential confounders, physical activity was significantly inversely associated with the presence of undiagnosed type 2 diabetes and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in older women. In older men, the association was less clear. BMI and WC were significantly positively associated with the presence of undiagnosed diabetes in men and were significantly associated with IFG in both sexes. In older women, undiagnosed diabetes was strongly associated with increased WC, but not with BMI. Our findings highlight that older women with low physical activity or high WC, and older men with high BMI or WC are important target populations for interventions to prevent glucose intolerance.",

Ninety-nine inpatients suffering from DSM-IV unipolar PMD were assessed on the basis of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV), Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) and a physical impairment rating scale. The elderly late-onset patients suffered from overall more severe depression compared to both early-onset ones, more psychic anxiety compared to elderly early-onset patients and more gastrointestinal symptoms compared to young early-onset patients. Additionally, they expressed significantly more frequently delusions of somatic content and higher scores on the HRSD item of hypochondriasis than their young early-onset counterparts. The group of elderly early-onset PMD patients was found to hold an intermediate position between the young early-onset and elderly late-onset PMD patients with regard to hypochondriacal ideation, gastrointestinal symptoms and delusions of somatic, guilt, and paranoid content. Their stability of delusional content across successive episodes was found to extend into old age. Nevertheless, they expressed additional somatic delusions.

     "abstract": "Confirming the presence of heart failure (HF) in geriatric patients is made difficult by the overlapping symptoms with other diseases and by limited access to investigative techniques such as echography, and the clinical signs are either non-constant or difficult to interpret. In this context, BNP measurement could prove highly useful. We determined a cut-off value of BNP for diagnosing HF in geriatric patients and gauged its predictive power in terms of cardiovascular events, dependence and death within a 6-month timeframe. This clinical and biological study was performed in patients, 44 women and 20 men, age\u00a0>\u00a065 years with suspected HF hospitalized in the geriatric unit at Emile-Roux hospital. Echography was performed at baseline examination. BNP concentrations were determined at baseline examination and at 2 and 6 months later. Renal function was assessed via the Cockroft\u2013Gault formula. Nutritional status was assessed using the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI). Final reference diagnosis was established by both cardiologist and geriatrician. The diagnostic value of BNP was assessed by area under the ROC curve. The average age of the 64 patients was 84.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.4 years. The final diagnosis was HF in 26 patients (41%). A BNP\u00a0<\u00a0129\u00a0pg/ml had a negative predictive value of 90% (accuracy 80%) for excluding the diagnosis of HF. BNP values were predictive of cardiovascular events over a 2-month timeframe in patients with HF and over a 6-month timeframe in the global population. BNP values were not predictive of mortality in patients with or without HF. BNP testing should help to differentiate pulmonary from cardiac etiologies of dyspnea, but a specific cut-off point has to be used in geriatric settings, mainly for patients presenting nutritional and renal dysfunctions.",

Functional autonomy was evaluated by a battery of tests from the LADEG protocol which is composed of: a 10\u00a0m walk (10 mW), getting up from a seated position (GSP), getting up from the prone position (GPP), getting up from a chair and movement around the house (GCMH), and putting on and taking off a shirt (PTS).

Inclusion criteria were: age\u00a0>\u00a065 years, diagnosis of a depressive disorder and intact cognition. The comparison group consisted of previous or subsequent admissions, closest (by date), of elderly patients, matching the inclusion criteria, but without previous record of attempting suicide, into the same ward. The cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) score was calculated for each patient. 78 admissions of elderly depressed patients, who had attempted suicide before hospitalization, were examined.

Fifty-three community free elderly Cretan women with an acute low energy hip fracture (29 with trochanteric and 24 with cervical fracture) and 70 community free elderly women without hip fracture were included in this study. Serum PTH, Ca, P and Cre showed no significant difference between the two fracture groups.

Nutritional risk was independently associated with MS for subjects in their 60s, but not in their 70s or 80s and above. In conclusion, high nutritional risk is associated with increased risk of MS in the elderly.

This course drew great attention and participation was common. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of this course on participants and non-participants of this course. The test-sheet and an envelope with a stamp on it, were sent to the registered addresses of the women who applied for the course. One hundred twenty-four of total 276 questionnaire returned. The average age was 39.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6 years (\u00b1S.D.) and the level of education was low. Most of participants (80.6%) lived with the elderly in the same house; 83.9% of them also have a job besides their caring function. Most of the participants (82.1%) were still caring for their patients. The findings presented here are based on the comparison of two groups (i.e., caregivers who attended and who did not attend the course). After caregiving training, participants felt more an \u201cinner peace\u201d when caring for their elderly (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Participants (39.5%) of the course felt more efficient concerning their duty as caregiver.

The test was especially efficient when it came to identifying problem areas in the psycho-physical state and frailty of elderly patients, as well as some loss of their own autonomy. These studies successfully tested a cohort of elderly people with similar symptoms.",

We aim to evaluate the results of a HP-eradicating program in a sample of older patients in relation to dyspeptic symptoms and to endoscopic findings. A pool of 140 subjects (female/ale\u00a0=\u00a086/54, mean age 68.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4 years) with positive C13-urea breath test were recruited, clinically evaluated to investigate the presence and characteristics of dyspepsia and abdominal pain, and underwent gastric endoscopic examination. HP-eradication was obtained in 87.9% of subjects with first-line triple therapy, regardless of endoscopic findings. Sixty-eight (48.6%) patients were symptomatic and 72 (51.4%) were asymptomatic. HP-related organic disease in endoscopic examination was frequent (present in 53.6% of the patients) but the distribution of different pathologies were similar in patients with and without symptoms (p\u00a0=\u00a00.86). Conclusions: even if diagnosis and treatment of HP infection in older patients is underestimated, this population should be a priority for HP-eradication since the infection is more frequent, peptic disease and gastric cancer are frequent, and eradication is effective.",

Factors identified included affection, filial obligation, sekentei (i.e., wanting to keep an appearance of taking care), and others. In this study, we examine these factors in a residential urban area, using the same model as before. Results revealed that filial obligation affected attitudes toward care in the case of a mother while affection did in the case of a mother-in-law. This is consistent with the results in the rural setting. Sekentei did not affect attitudes in the urban area, though it had in the rural area.",

Utilization of medical healthcare decreased slightly in the years following the decision about long-term care. Despite younger age and less dependency in activities of daily living (ADL), those living at home utilized hospital and outpatient care to a greater extent than those in special accommodation; these differences remained over time. Thus, it seems as long-term care needs to become more effective in the prevention of medical healthcare utilization among those cared for at home. More, older people who are granted long-term care at home may otherwise imply increased utilization of medical healthcare.",

A questionnaire survey was conducted among Specialist Registrars (SpRs) in Geriatric Medicine attending a single training day within five UK Post-graduate Deaneries to assess self-report experience of elder abuse training during their post-graduate medical education. The questionnaire included quantity, quality and self-report confidence in dealing with elder abuse issues. A total of 112 questionnaires were returned (response rate 100%, representing 78.9% of eligible trainees within these five deaneries). The majority of the participants rated low scores for both quantity and quality of training they received. This finding was consistent across all 5 years of training with no significant difference in rating scores in more experienced (years 3\u20135) SpRs. The majority (62.5%) of final year SpRs reported feeling inadequately prepared to deal with cases of elder abuse. The results of our survey suggest that the provision and quality of training regarding elder abuse is poor for trainees in Geriatric Medicine. The majority of SpRs approaching the completion of their training felt ill-prepared in managing such cases.

Since several decades the receptor concept is in the foreground of cell biology and pharmacology. We present here a short reminder of Ehrlich's concepts on receptor action, its evolution and modifications as a result of increasing life expectancy of human societies. Results obtained by several teams on the age-dependent modifications of receptor function are reviewed with special emphasis on the age-dependent loss of receptors and of uncoupling of receptors from their intracellular transmission pathway. As a special example we summarize our results on the elastin receptor and its age-dependent modifications. These modifications result in the loss of the physiologically helpful functions mediated by this receptor, such as vasodilation by coupling with the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-inhibition of cellular cholesterol synthesis and modulation of free radical production by inhibition of the guanine nucleotide binding protein (Gi protein)-mediated transmission pathway. Only the harmful effects such as free radical release and up-regulation of elastase production remain in \u201cold\u201d cells. The age-dependent modifications of receptor function play an important role in the increasing frequency and severity of age-related diseases such as athero-arteriosclerosis and emphysema as well as the loss of hormone- and drug actions. These processes and their inhibition or correction represent a new challenge for cellular pharmacology.",

Thirteen patients who could not visit our clinic on regular basis were instructed to do the same set of exercises at home, with the same duration and frequency. All scales were evaluated again on their follow-up visits 2 months later. Patients in both groups showed statistically significant improvement in DHI and Tinetti scales. A higher percentage of patients in the supervised-exercise-program (SP) group showed clinically significant outcome improvements. Age was not a predictive factor for rehabilitation outcome.

This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of pain among patients in eight Italian geriatric hospital departments, correlated to prescribed therapy. We enrolled 387 patients in the study, 367 of whom were evaluated. Each patient's recovery, co-morbidity, pain intensity, prescribed therapy, side effects, duration of pain, and efficacy of therapy were monitored during two 15-day periods from 15 July to end of August 2008, and from 1 October to 15 November 2008. The results of this study confirmed that hypertension, cardiopathic disease, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are common pathologies, and that pain is present in 67.3% of those recovered in geriatric departments. In general, however, pain is not treated. Indeed only 49% of those with pain had any type of treatment, which was adequate for the pain intensity. In fact 74.5% of patients considered the therapy to be of low or no efficacy. These data demonstrate the presence of pain in a high percentage of elderly patients, which is either not treated, or treated inadequately. Controlling pain is essential in elderly patients in order to allow a normal life and an active role in family and society. The main conclusion is that pain is often poorly considered in the elderly, thus leading to a dangerous under-treatment. We want to underline the crucial clinical impact of such under-treatment in elderly patients.",

From January 2000 to December 2007, 107 consecutive patients aged \u226575 years received radiotherapy with radical intent for PC. Eighty-one patients received radiotherapy in combination with a 6 months androgen suppression therapy. Variables considered were age, stage, co-morbidities according to the adult co-morbidity evaluation index (ACE-27) and performance status (PS). The median age was 79.1 years (range 76\u201387). The 23.4% of patients showed no co-morbidities, while the 46.7% had mild, 23.4% moderate, and 6.5% severe co-morbidities, respectively. All patients completed the planned radiation treatment. At a median follow-up of 37.8 months, the 5-year overall survival rate was 78%. There was a better survival for patients with no or mild co-morbidities (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and a good PS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). The actuarial disease-free survival at 60 months was 75.8%. Difference in acute and late toxicity rate was detected between ACE-27 classes for diarrhea and marginally for urinary toxicity, but no difference was detected for different age. We conclude that compliance with radiotherapy is good and rate of toxicity is acceptable in elderly patients. Increasing severity of co-morbidity may sufficiently shorten remaining life expectancy to cancel gains with radical radiotherapy. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.",

The mean age and weight were 69.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.4 years and 56.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.6\u00a0kg, respectively. Accordingly to the body mass index (BMI), 52.8% were of normal weight and 47.1% of the patients were overweight. Overweight women had significantly higher bone mass. Similarly, skeletal muscle index (SMI) showed a positive effect on BMD measurements and women with sarcopenia had significantly lower BMD measurements in total femur and femoral neck. In multiple regression analysis only lean mass and age, after adjustments to fat mass and BMI, were able to predict total body bone mineral content (BMC) (R2\u00a0=\u00a028%). Also lean mass adjusted to age and BMI were able to predict femoral neck BMD (R2\u00a0=\u00a014%). On the other hand, none of the components of the body composition (lean mass or fat mass) contributed significantly to explaining total femur BMD and neither body composition measurements were associated with spine BMD. These findings suggest that lean mass has a relevant role in BMC and BMD measurements. In addition, lower BMI and lean mass loss (sarcopenia) is associated to lower BMC and BMD of femoral neck and total femur and possible higher risk of osteoporotic fracture.",

We evaluated retrospectively 338 patients aged 60 years and over (290 females, median age 69 years) to assess the incidence and predictive factors for pulmonary complications, including pulmonary thromboembolism after TKA. Of these patients, 264 underwent simultaneous bilateral TKA (78%) by two surgeons and 56 (17%) had general anesthesia. No patient received thromboprophylaxis. There were 49 postoperative pulmonary complications in the 338 patients (14.2%, 49/338).

No pulmonary complication was fatal. Multivariate analysis revealed that pulmonary hypertension (right ventricular systolic pressure\u00a0\u2265\u00a035\u00a0mmHg on transthoracic echocardiography; odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a03.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) was independently associated with pulmonary complications.

Pulmonary hypertension may thus predict pulmonary complications and a PaCO2 greater than 45\u00a0mmHg may be a risk factor for pulmonary thromboembolism following TKA. Preoperative blood gas analysis and transthoracic echocardiography can identify those patients at high risk for pulmonary complications, including pulmonary thromboembolism, after TKA in elderly Korean patients.",

We conclude that in the elderly patients with favorable tolerance of PCI, PCI immediate success rate was similar to that of the young patients, suggesting that complete revascularization of the very old patients might improve the prognosis and reduce the incidence of cardiac events.",

Elderly individuals aged 60 years or over, who were assisted by the FHP primary care system (n\u00a0=\u00a02209), responded to a sociodemographic and health questionnaire. Mental health was evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) and quality of life was assessed by the Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36). In order to verify which independent variables affected the occurrence of falls, logistic regression analysis was performed. 27.1% of the sample reported one fall during the previous year, and 8.7% were recurrent fallers over the same period. The factors considered in the final model for falls were: age over 80 years-old, female gender, the presence of more than eight associated diseases, need for hospitalization during the previous year and appointments outside the FHP routine, hearing complaints, GDS score over 11 points, and emotional problems SF-36 score between 25 and 74 points. The factors included in the final model for falls can be easily identified and properly overcome by FHP strategy. Patient falling history investigation should thus form part of the FHP team routine. This concern should be reinforced when it comes to women aged 80 years and over.",

     "abstract": "Several studies have demonstrated a global increase in morbidity and mortality in elderly subjects with low social support or high comorbidity. However, the relationship between social support and comorbidity on long-term mortality in elderly people is not yet known. Thus, the present study was performed to evaluate the relationship between social support and comorbidity on 12-year mortality of elderly people. A random sample of 1288 subjects aged 65\u201395 years interviewed in 1992 was studied. Comorbidity by Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score and Social Support by a scale in which total score ranges from 0 to 17, assigning to lowest social support the highest score, were evaluated. At 12-year follow-up, mortality progressively increase with low social support and comorbidity increasing (from 41.5% to 66.7% and from 41.2% to 68.3%, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Moreover, low social support progressively increases with comorbidity increasing (and 12.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5 to 14.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Accordingly, multivariate analysis shows an increased mortality risk of 23% for each increase of tertile of social support scale (Hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a0HR\u00a0=\u00a01.23; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u20131.51; p\u00a0=\u00a00.045). Moreover, when the analysis was performed considering different degrees of comorbidity we found that social support level was predictive of mortality only in subjects with the highest comorbidity (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.39; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.082\u20131.78; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Thus, low social support is predictive of long-term mortality in the elderly. Moreover, the effect of social support on mortality increases in subjects with the highest comorbidity.",

One hundred and thirty healthy elderly women performed the step test in which they stepped in place for 20\u00a0s while matching a metronome beat to tempos of 40, 60, and 120\u00a0bpm, respectively. The evaluation parameter was the time difference between the metronome sound and the time when subject's foot hit the ground. The subjects were divided into four groups according to (1) whether they had experienced a fall and (2) activity level. The time difference showed significantly greater variance in the order of 40, 60 and 120\u00a0bpm in both groups of high activity and low activity. A significant time difference between groups was found only in the 40\u00a0bpm tempo where the low activity group's value was higher. The correlations between the time difference and gait time were significant in all tempos of both groups (r\u00a0=\u00a00.24\u20130.41). The time differences in 40 and 60\u00a0bpm step tests showed significant and moderate correlations (r\u00a0=\u00a00.52\u20130.60) with gait time in the low activity group, but low correlations (r\u00a0=\u00a00.29\u20130.30) in the high activity group. In conclusion, the stipulated step test can evaluate the level of daily activity ability in the elderly at home and it is effective in evaluating their balance ability.",

The authors review literature on oldest old population with a focus on unanswered questions: do socioeconomic status (SES) gradients in mortality persist after 80; does the magnitude of the gradient change as compared with younger populations; which socioeconomic/socio-demographic determinants should be used in this population with specific characteristics (e.g., with respect to sex ratio and household type)? Results are often inconsistent while conclusions drawn by selected studies are generally limited by the difficulty of disentangling the effects of age and cohort, and of generalizing results observed in preponderantly small, selected samples (which typically exclude institutionalized persons). Future research should explore the effects of socio-demographic indicators other than education and social class (e.g., marital status, loss of the partner) and adequately differentiate the social position of oldest old women. The authors recommend that research applies a life-course perspective combined with an interdisciplinary perspective to improve our understanding of the SES gradients in later life. Research is needed to elucidate which causal pathways depending on SES in younger age impact on mortality in higher ages up to oldest old.",

A lot of researchers emphasize beneficial effects of red wine and insist on lower or no antioxidant effect of white wine. We have been studying the effect of both white and red wine on blood antioxidant capacity in humans. The white wine we have been testing was produced by an ancient Tuscany procedure (the same used for red winemaking) which includes fermentation with grapes juice together with peelings and seeds. A statistically significant increase in total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels was observed after 2\u00a0h from red or white wine ingestion. White wine effect appears to be faster than that of the red one, since a significant difference can also be reported after 1\u00a0h. We can conclude that the big difference in the results of serum TAC due to white wine reported by us, in comparison to those reported by others relatively to white wine produced using the French method, can be explained by the difference in the winemaking procedure we adopted.",

Fifty-seven older residents of intermediate care facilities in Sydney, Australia were interviewed to determine their sun exposure practices, their views on sunlight and health and whether these have changed over their lives, factors affecting sunlight exposure and their knowledge of vitamin D. Sixty percent of the participants preferred to be outdoors, despite more than 92% believing that sunlight was healthy. In their youth however, almost 90% had preferred to be outdoors. Poor health, physical constraints and a sense of lack of ownership of outdoor spaces were barriers to sunlight exposure. Improved physical access, more outdoor leisure activities and promotion of greater autonomy may improve safe and appropriate sunlight exposure in this population.",

Our aim was to assess the reliability of spectral-based outcomes of the centre of pressure (CoP) kinematics in order to determine if these outcomes could be tested for their capability to distinguish between elderly fallers and non-fallers in a future study. We have studied balance for 30 community dwelling healthy older adults 60 years or older. Four test conditions were used. Three successive trials were performed for each condition. CoP kinematics were estimated with a force platform with three strain gauges set in a triangular position. The frequency content of these signals was estimated. Intrasession correlation coefficients (ICC's) were then calculated for all test conditions. The reliability of the selected parameters varied between low and high (ICC 0.652\u20130.939). The ICC's for the narrow stance tests were higher compared to tests with normal standing conditions (0.771\u20130.94) to (0.652\u20130.865). The highest value was obtained in the high frequency band (0.939). These measures should be viewed with caution when screening geriatric patients because their reliability cannot always be assumed.",

Information was collected for each patient: age, sex, diseases, urinary catheter, temperature, signs of severe sepsis, biological examinations, bacteria and antibiotic treatments. All bacteremias were nosocomial. There was no difference between groups for pathogen, source or prognosis. Mortality rate at 60 days was 32.3%. The risk factors for mortality were: low albumin rate (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), high C-reactive protein (CRP) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and moderate fever (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Multivariate logistic regression showed that these three parameters were significantly associated with a risk of mortality. The parameter with the highest risk was a low albumin rate <30\u00a0g/l. Malnutrition may be a more long-term risk factor. A moderate fever probably results in a more frequent delay in diagnosis in this population. Our work supports that age is not a risk factor of mortality for bloodstream infections. However management of bacteremia has to be adapted to elderly.",

It was detected that life satisfaction levels of elderly people were average, a great majority of them went through mobility disability and there was a significant correlation between mobility and life satisfaction. It was established that in elderly people mobility was affected by the age, gender and chronic diseases while life satisfaction was related to age, education level and health perception level. Disability is a factor that has a significant effect on the life satisfaction of elderly people.

Patients over 70 years who underwent a renal biopsy between 2000 and 2007 in Rennes University Hospital were retrospectively analyzed for biopsy complications, clinical features, diagnosis, therapy and its complications, evolution and mortality. Among the 150 renal-biopsied patients, 60% had a glomerulopathy and 30% had nephrotic syndrome. Biopsy complications occurred in 3.3%. 64% of nephrotic patients received immunosuppressive treatment and 62% of them developed drug-associated complications. In the treated group, there was more remission and survival at day 1000 was improved. Renal biopsy may be indicated in the elderly, because it often gives a therapeutically useful diagnosis and complications are rare if contra-indications are respected. Kidney biopsy revealed histological diagnoses that were not usually suspected by the clinical presentation. In addition, immunosuppressive therapy did not alter the mortality rate, but did increase survival at 3 years.",

Social relations were studied on the basis of frequency seeing one's offspring, perceptions of the sufficiency of these contacts, and by asking whom the participants considered as their closest person and how often and in how many tasks they helped someone. The cohort comparisons showed that the frequency of seeing one's offspring had decreased in the most recent cohort and that the number of contacts was considered more inadequate. Longitudinal analyses showed that although the proportion of children as the closest persons increased, meetings with them became fewer. Helping others was more common in the last cohort, but in the longitudinal analyses it decreased with age.

Future prospective clinical trials should therefore more accurately reflect the NSTE-ACS patient population by including more elderly patients and including efficacy endpoints that are relevant for these patients. Furthermore, the lack of clear clinical evidence in this population means that the current treatment guidelines do not fully address the needs of elderly patients.

Some studies have demonstrated that cigarette smoking is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in the elderly, whereas other studies have shown cigarette smoking to be protective against dementia. This study aims to explore the relationship between cigarette smoking and cognitive impairment in elderly persons without dementia, during a 10-year period. Data were derived from a population-based cohort study of 1436 elderly Taiwanese. Cognitive function was measured by the SPMSQ both in 1993 and in 2003. A total of 1436 participants free of cognitive impairment at baseline (SPMSQ\u00a0\u2265\u00a06 in 1993) were included in these analyses. Subsequently, participants were divided into three groups: never, past, and current smokers. The effect of cigarette smoking on cognitive function was assessed using logistic regression. In the logistic regression model adjusted for age, education, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and stroke at baseline, persons who had quit smoking (Odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a0OR\u00a0=\u00a00.31; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.18\u20130.53; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and those who continued to smoke (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.37; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.20\u20130.70; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were about one-third as likely to develop cognitive impairment as were those who never smoked. However, no dose\u2013response relationship was observed between pack-years and cognitive impairment. Past and current smokers were less likely to develop cognitive impairment during a 10-year follow-up than were those who had never smoked.

Ten percent of the study participants experienced onset of mobility disability at follow-up. Significantly more individuals in the lower social classes experienced onset of mobility disability and never anticipated instrumental support, compared to the higher social classes. In this middle-aged population the anticipation of instrumental support had no significant effect on mobility disability at 6-year follow-up. Social class did not modify the association between anticipated instrumental support and mobility, but was the most important confounder. Further research on the effect of social support on mobility in midlife is needed in order to identify individuals at risk of disability at an early stage.",

The main purpose of this study was to explore the optimal model of dementia care in Taiwan by evaluating the care cost, patients\u2019 QoL and healthcare settings. Overall, 140 pairs of demented patients and their primary informal caregivers were enrolled (89 community-living and 51 institute-living). Compared to institute-living subjects, community-living subjects were significantly better in cognition, physical function and QoL. The annual direct cost of institutional care was significantly higher than community care (464,193 New Taiwanese Dollar (NTD) vs. 144,047 (NTD), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but indirect cost was significantly higher in home care (287,904 NTD vs. 35,665 NTD, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The care cost of home care subjects with low physical dependence was significantly lower than institutional care subjects, but the care cost of home care subjects with high physical dependence was significantly higher than institutional care subjects. Physical dependence was the significant determinant of QoL for demented patients in this study. In conclusion, demented patients with low physical dependence may be cared in the communities with support and those who had high physical dependence may be cared in the institutes in terms of the balance of QoL and the care cost.",

Sixty-three osteoporotic women over 60 years of age were randomly assigned to 12 months of muscle exercise or to no intervention. The outcomes were changes in muscle strength and quality of life (QoL). Ultimately, sixty-two participants completed the 12 months program. Before the start of home-exercise training, the lumbar spine bone mineral density (BMD) and femoral neck BMD values in the intervention group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The participants were 166 older women at high risk and 171 age-matched controls at low risk of frailty according to the long-term care insurance (LTCI) system (age: 65\u201390 years). The mobility performance tests included 5-chair sit-to-stand (STS), alternate step, timed up-and-go (TUG), timed rapid gait (TRG), and usual gait speed (UGS). Data analysis showed that high-risk individuals (81.9%) were more likely to be pre-frail than low-risk individuals (55.0%) by Fried's frailty phenotype. The four mobility performance tests, except the 5-chair STS, had the largest areas under the curve (AUC) for discriminating older women at high and low risk (AUC\u00a0>\u00a00.80, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The optimal cutpoint (6\u00a0s) for the TRG test had the highest sensitivity (78%) and specificity (83%) in identifying high risk of frailty.

Their demographic characteristics, cognitive function, their balance, falling risk and their physical fitness level have been evaluated. A survey has been done to determine their demographic features. The cognitive function was determined using mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test; for falling risk the Berg balance test (BBT) and balance by standing on one foot test were used, and the physical fitness was determined by senior fitness test (SFT). While the BBT correlation between chair stand, arm curl and 2-min step test are positive; but the correlation between BBT and \u20188-foot up-and-go test\u2019 were negative. However, there was no correlation between the BBT and chair sit-and-reach test, back scratch test (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).

Depressive symptoms were measured using the 30-item Korean version of the Geriatric Depression Scale (K-GDS), with a cutoff point of 18. The prevalence of depressive symptoms in elderly Korean women was higher than in men (20.9% vs. 9.2%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

We investigated whether the ABC-6 is a valid and reliable measure of balance confidence and examined its relationship to balance impairment and falls in older adults. Thirty-five community-dwelling older adults completed the ABC-16, including the 6 questions of the ABC-6. They also completed the following clinical balance tests: unipedal stance time (UST), functional reach (FR), Timed Up and Go (TUG), and maximum step length (MSL). Participants reported 12-month falls history. Balance confidence on the ABC-6 was significantly lower than on the ABC-16, however scores were highly correlated. Fallers reported lower balance confidence than non-fallers as measured by the ABC-6 scale, but confidence did not differ between the groups with the ABC-16. The ABC-6 significantly correlated with all balance tests assessed and number of falls. The ABC-16 significantly correlated with all balance tests assessed, but not with number of falls. Test\u2013retest reliability for the ABC-16 and ABC-6 was good to excellent. The ABC-6 is a valid and reliable measure of balance confidence in community-dwelling older adults, and shows stronger relationships to falls than does the ABC-16. The ABC-6 may be a more useful balance confidence assessment tool than the ABC-16.",

A total of 103 elderly CKD patients were investigated. The GFR was estimated with Cockcroft\u2013Gault-equation, MDRD1-equation, abbreviated MDRD-equation, Jelliffe-1973-equation, Mawer-equation, Hull-equation, Jelliffe-1971-equation, SC-reciprocal-equation, Gate-equation and Bjornsson-equation. The accuracy of estimated GFR (eGFR) values was compared with the 99mTc-DTPA-GFR (standardized GFR\u00a0=\u00a0sGFR) in elderly CKD patients. Bland\u2013Altman analysis demonstrated that Hull-equation, Cockcroft\u2013Gault-equation and Bjornsson-equation were better than the other ones. However, the agreement limits of all the equations exceeded the prior acceptable tolerances defined as 60\u00a0ml/min/(1.73\u00a0m2). Linear regressions showed that the slopes of Jelliffe-1973-equation, Cockcroft\u2013Gault-equation and Bjornsson-equation were closer to the identical line. The median of difference of MDRD1-equation, abbreviated MDRD-equation and Gate-equation were smaller. Accuracy of Jelliffe-1973-equation, Cockcroft\u2013Gault-equation and Hull-equation were better than those of the other equations. But 30% accuracy of all the equations were less than 70%. When compared the bias as well as accuracy of eGFR with sGFR values in different stages of CKD, GFR estimated by MDRD1-equation, Hull-equation, Cockcroft\u2013Gault-equation and Jelliffe-1973-equation showed good results. These results suggested that when SC was checked with enzymatic method, GFR-estimation equations may show great bias in elderly Chinese CKD patients. Further improved formulas are needed to evaluate renal function in elderly Chinese patients with CKD.",

The impact of diabetes mellitus (DM), asthma bronchiale, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on the risk of having a low serum phosphatemia (S-P) in addition to influenza is important to investigate as this increases both morbidity and mortality and can be prevented. Hypophosphatemia could be the explanation for reduced chemo-taxis and phagocytosis, which in addition to respiratory function may increase the risk of pneumonia and sepsis. Data for this study was collected from the medical journals retrospectively for 100 patients admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases during the study period, 1992\u201394, with the clinical diagnosis influenza out of which seventy-two cases were used in the calculation. Forty-seven percent of the hospitalized influenza patients had a 2.7-fold risk of suffering from DM than of any other chronic disease and an almost significantly doubled risk of having a low S-P level with a chronic disease. The prevalence of hypophosphatemia (S-P\u00a0<\u00a00.70\u00a0mmol/l) was high; 13.0% of the women and 15.0% of the men; 34.0% of all patients had S-P\u00a0<\u00a00.82\u00a0mmol/l.

From January 2002 to December 2007, 42 consecutive patients with glioblastoma (27 men and 15 women) aged 65 years or more (median age 71.3 years), received radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant TMZ. Nineteen patients (45.2%) had a Karnofsky index \u226580. Thirty-six patients (85.8%) underwent complete or subtotal resection, while 6 patients (14.2%) were only biopsied. All patients received adjuvant radiotherapy within 4 weeks from surgery. Twenty-two patients (54.8%) underwent adjuvant TMZ. Early discontinuation of concomitant TMZ program due to toxicity was observed in 8 patients. Considered variables were: age, Karnofsky index, surgery versus no surgery, radiation dose, and chemotherapy. At a median follow-up of 10.2 months, the 6- and 12-month overall survival rates were 81.9% and 27.8%, respectively. There was a significantly better survival for patients with a performance status according to Karnofsky >80 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

Magnesium is a trace mineral, but is the second most abundant intracellular cation and the fourth most abundant cation in the body. This was a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of hypomagnesemia (HM) in non-selected elderly LTC patients. A total of 159 patients aged 65 years and older were included in the study. The attributes and variables related to the patients\u2019 hospital course were used to compare the two groups. We used univariate and multivariate analyses to correlate magnesium levels with demographic, clinical factors and laboratory data. HM was found in 36% of the patients, of whom 35% presented with moderate HM (0.8\u20130.9\u00a0\u03bcequiv./l) and 18% with severe HM (\u22640.7\u00a0\u03bcequiv./l).

Both early (up to 30 days) and late rate of death were higher in patients with HM. The incidence of HM in LTC elderly patients is high and multifactorial.

We completed a subgroup analysis of patients 65 years of age or older enrolled in PREVIEW, a prospective, multicenter, pharmacoepidemiological study of the determinants and outcomes of second-line antihypertensive treatment with valsartan in Belgium. Multilevel modeling was used to identify physician- and patient-level determinants of blood pressure values and practice guideline-derived definitions of blood pressure control. Data on 1560 patients and 504 physicians were used in this analysis. Blood pressure control rates for patients age 65 and over were lower for systolic (34.2% vs. 38.6%) and combined systolic/diastolic blood pressure (31.2% vs. 34.4%) compared to the entire PREVIEW sample. Twenty-seven percent of the variability in systolic, and 32% in diastolic pressure after 90 days of treatment were attributable to such variables as physicians\u2019 knowledge and adherence to evidence-based guidelines, practice patterns, and experience; with the remaining variance attributable to various demographic, behavioral, and clinical patient-related factors.

The analyses predicted mortality within 4 years, adjusting for sociodemographic and health variables. Relative to the optimal profile, most functioning profiles represented groups having elevated mortality risks of considerable consistency across cohorts. Physical functioning was the most predictive component in the profiles, but its combinations with cognitive and affective functioning produced unique contributions to mortality prediction. The study suggests that the functioning profile, representing a person-centered configurative approach (i.e., one that considers the person's combined standing on key factors), is a useful concept for delineating risk groups in late life and evaluating risk factors in predicting mortality.",

One hundred nurses and 57 physicians ultimately completed the questionnaires. The main finding was that participants had a low level of knowledge of elder abuse issues and the relevant laws and regulations (mean correct answers 5.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.45 of 10 and 4.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.34 of 8, respectively).

No significant differences relating to the knowledge of elder abuse were found between nurses and physicians nor between general and geriatric hospital employees. Both physicians and nurses tended to have neutral attitudes regarding this issue. However, employees of geriatric hospitals had better attitudes than general hospital workers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Most responders believed that the unwillingness to get legally involved had been the main reason of not reporting suspected cases. This study emphasizes the need to take more efficient measures to improve the knowledge of the medical and nursing staff concerning elder abuse and to encourage medical personnel to be more concerned and involved in the safeguarding of the elderly.",

One hundred and eighty-two senile patients scheduled for elective noncardiac surgery were selected. According to the Duke activity status index (DASI), the FC of each patient was evaluated, and also their CVRFs were recorded. According to the number of CVRFs, the patients were ranked into different groups. The significant differences in FC between the groups\u2019 were identified using the analysis of variance. The examination showed that FC decreased with the increasing number of CVRFs. As a conclusion, we emphasize that with the increasing number of CVRFs, the FC of senile patients, i.e., their metabolic equivalents (METs) decrease. The occurrence of low FC and higher CVRFs is a common phenomenon in senile patients.",

The high prevalence of oral parafunctional habits and dry mouth symptoms in patients with BMS suggests that inflammation at the subclinical level due to repetitive microtrauma may cause burning mouth sensations. In this study, using a comprehensive questionnaire, we have investigated the efficacy of oral habit control and use of topical lubricant or corticosteroid on oral complaints associated with BMS. Twenty-five patients with BMS (1 man and 24 women, mean age 59.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3 years) were included to investigate the effects of habit control and topical lubricant on discomforts associated with BMS. Another 29 patients (2 men and 27 women, mean age 55.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.6 years) were included to investigate the effects of habit control and topical dexamethasone (DXM). The burning and aching qualities of discomfort, and the effect of oral complaints on daily life were significantly decreased by both types of treatments. However, there were no significant differences between the different treatment groups. The salivary flow rate did not affect the treatment outcome. We concluded that the concomitant prescription of topical lubricants with oral habit control is an effective initial approach for patients with BMS.",

IL-6 levels reached peak values immediately after the surgery, while CRP peak levels were reached 48\u00a0h after the surgery. The overall inflammatory reaction was more intense in HA patients compared to the other subgroups. Independent of each other, older age and the hip fracture type affected the IL-6 response, while the CRP response depended only on the type of surgery. The abrupt increase in IL-6 immediately after the procedure suggests its involvement in the early stages of the postoperative inflammatory reaction after hip surgery. This reaction is particularly pronounced in elderly patients receiving HA.",

We considered 126 patients from a randomized population recovered in RSA of Viagrande (Catania) in the period from 1st March, 2005 and 31st March, 2007. Those who proved to be demented according to the DSM-III diagnostic protocols, and having a mini mental state examination (MMSE)-score <24 were divided in 2 groups: Group A, all the demented people without the DLB; and Group B, the DLB patients, according to the diagnostic criteria of McKeith. All patients underwent at admission, after 1 month, and at emission the following psychometric and functional tests: MMSE, geriatric depression scale (GDS) [Yesavage J.A., Brink T.L., Rose T.L., Adey M., 1983. The development and validation of geriatric depression screening scale: a preliminary report. J. Psych. Res. 17, 37], Barthel index (BI), activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL). Particular attention was dedicated to the presence of delirium during the last 15 days before the admission and during the recovery, the mortality and the prevalence of other complaints. The observed data confirm the prevalence of fragility of DLB patients in 20% of them, a fluctuation of the cognitive capacities, a better recovery of the affectivity, a reduced functional autonomy and autosufficiency. In addition, the DLB patients display a major presence of prevalent delirium, compared to the total population of demented patients, while in this last population only incidental delirium episodes occurred during the recovery period (31.6% vs. 16.6%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

This study aims to understand how family caregivers\u2019 mental health and caregiver burden affects physical health simultaneously, controlling for factors such as age, education level, caring hours per day, and emotional, functional, and physical support systems used by caregivers. We recruited 388 caregivers from Kaohsiung and Pingtong region in Taiwan. Caregivers had to be 18 years or older and spend most of their time taking care of an ill family member at home. Mental health was assessed by the 12-item Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ-12) and burden was measured using a modified scale for caregiver's burden. Health status was assessed by self-perceived health (SPH), illness symptoms and the number of diagnosed chronic diseases. A high number of hours per day of caregiving was associated with low emotional support and SPH, poor mental health and high burden. Higher emotional support was associated with better mental health and fewer illness symptoms. Higher physical support was associated with poorer mental health, higher burden, a greater number of illness symptoms and chronic diseases, and a lower SPH score. Hours per day of caregiving, and use of emotional, functional, and physical support were associated with mental health, and the hours per day of caregiving and use of physical support were predictors of burden. Mental health and burden were significantly associated with caregivers\u2019 health problems simultaneously.

In 85-year-olds, significant associations were found, by multiple regression analysis or logistic regression analysis, with adjustment for various influencing factors in QoL assessed by SF-36 with physical fitness measurements examined at the age of 85 and 80 years. Physical scales and scores in SF-36, such as physical functioning (PF), limitation in role functioning for physical reasons (role physical; RP), bodily pain (BP), and the physical component score (PCS) tended to be more tightly associated with fitness measurements than mental scales and scores such as limitation in role functioning for emotional reasons (role emotional; RE), and emotional well-being (mental health; MH), and mental component score (MCS). Three scales the general health perceptions (GH), the vitality (VT), and the social functioning (SF) consisting of both physical and mental components were associated with fitness, the extent being intermediate between physical scales and mental scales. Of the several physical fitness measurements, leg-extensor strength and the walking speed of 85-year-olds, and the stepping rate of 80-year-olds were most closely associated with QoL. In a very elderly population of 85- and 80-year-olds, significant associations were found between QoL by SF-36 and physical fitness measurements, suggesting that increases in the levels of physical fitness, even in the very elderly, can contribute to improvements in QoL.",

Burdened caregivers experienced poorer general health (GH), more bodily pain (BP), less vitality (VT), difficulties with social functioning (SF), and poorer mental health (MH) than less burdened caregivers. While all caregivers scored below expected Japanese average scores for Health-related quality of life short form-36 (HRQoL SF-36), those reporting utilization of private care services, providing care regularly, and providing care for more than 5\u00a0h per day exhibited the lowest scores. Caregivers of centenarians may not represent models of successful caregivers. Caregivers showed equal distribution of light and heavy burden among recipient age groups therefore it may be inferred that as care recipient age increases it is not inevitable that they become heavier burdens on their caregivers. This is the first in-depth study to investigate the unique situation of centenarians and their caregivers in Northern Japan.",

The complete or third degree AVB is a bradyarrhythmia characterized by the absence of paroxystic or permanent atrioventricular conduction. Several studies conducted on subjects between the ages of 60 and 85 pointed out that the incidence of AVB-type bradyarrhythmias of a degree greater than the first is extremely rare, i.e., it is close to zero. It is, however, necessary to make an early diagnosis of the AVB, as in many cases it may complicate the patient's clinical progress and may often lead to sudden death. Clinical and experimental observations have shown that electrocardiographic alterations and arrhythmias are frequent complications of cerebral accidents such as head traumas, or of ophthalmic surgery. It is therefore necessary, especially in elderly patients in whom bradyarrhythmias are characterized by the presence of widespread histological alterations of the conduction system, to perform a 24-h monitoring of all adverse events that may lead to an AVB.",

Our aim was to examine the economic effect of donepezil treatment for mild cognitive impairment, from which about 15% convert to dementia per year. We constructed a new Markov model using three simulations. Namely, Simulation A hypothesized that mild AD patients, i.e., Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 1, received donepezil as in the previous study. Simulation B hypothesized that all CDR 0.5 subjects received donepezil, and Simulation C considered that only the CDR 0.5 converters to dementia received donepezil. We calculated the models as follows: Simulation B, supposes that the annual transition probabilities were reduced even from 15% to 10% by donepezil, however, the drug had a negative economic effect. By contrast, in Simulation C, the annual transition probability was reduced from only 15% to 12% by donepezil, there was a positive economic effect. Since it is necessary to reduce the annual transition probability from 15% to 12% in order to manifest a concomitant economic benefit, we consider that early detection of CDR 0.5 converters in the community is important for health policy planning.",

     "abstract": "Determining an older adult's capacity to live safely and independently in the community presents a serious and complicated challenge to the health care system. Evaluating one's ability to make and execute decisions regarding safe and independent living incorporates clinical assessments, bioethical considerations, and often legal declarations of capacity. Capacity assessments usually result in life changes for patients and their families, including a caregiver managing some everyday tasks, placement outside of the home, and even legal guardianship. The process of determining capacity and recommending intervention is often inefficient and highly variable in most cases. Physicians are rarely trained to conduct capacity assessments and assessment methods are heterogeneous. An interdisciplinary team (IDT) of clinicians developed the capacity assessment and intervention (CAI) model at a community outpatient geriatrics clinic to address these critical gaps. This report follows one patient through the entire CAI model, describing processes for a typical case. It then examines two additional case reports that highlight common challenges in capacity assessment. The CAI model uses assessment methods common to geriatrics clinical practice and conducts assessments and interventions in a standardized fashion. Reliance on common, validated measures increases generalizability of the model across geriatrics practice settings and patient populations.",

     "abstract": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a complex and heterogeneous clinical syndrome and because of its rising incidence and prevalence, it can be considered a global epidemic. Interleukin (IL)-22 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine, belonging to the IL-10 family. Forty-seven consecutive older patients, hospitalized with an admitting diagnosis of CHF at the Geriatric Medicine Unit (University of Messina, Italy), from 01/01/06 to 30/06/06, were enrolled in the study. Serum concentrations of IL-22 were measured by a quantitative enzyme immunoassay technique. IL-22 levels in all CHF patients were significantly higher than those in controls, in particular, only the II and III NYHA class had IL-22 values significantly higher than the controls, whereas there was no difference between the IL-22 levels of NYHA class IV and the controls. The reason may be the declining immune function in CHF older patients, in fact we can hypothesize that the fall in IL-22 levels, with the progression of NYHA class, is due to the reduced ability in CHF patients to respond to infections, as IL-22 has anti-microbial properties. We detected different outcomes correlated to different IL-22 levels, and the Kaplan\u2013Meier curves suggest a trend.",

     "abstract": "The demands of long-term care facilities (LTCFs) residents are complex which usually require a range of professionals and caregivers to provide treatment and care. To reduce this fragmentation of care, integrated care models are developed in modern health care system, and a gradual change from traditional LTCF care to integrated care has occurred in many countries. Although integrated care is assumed to improve the quality of care, evidences supporting these effects are insufficient. We recruited 7 private LTCF (74 residents) in northern Taipei and randomized them into integrated care model (N\u00a0=\u00a042, mean age\u00a0=\u00a082.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.0 years, 54.8% males) and traditional model (N\u00a0=\u00a032, 81.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8 years, 43.8% males). Integrated care model group was provided an actively working interdisciplinary team in addition to traditional nursing and personal care in traditional model group. Physical function, nutritional status and several quality indicators (unplanned feeding tube replacement, unplanned urinary catheter replacement, pneumonia, urinary tract infection and so on) were compared with both groups. Overall, LTCF residents in the integrated care model group showed significant improvement in serum levels of albumin (3.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32 vs. 3.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and hemoglobin (12.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.58 vs. 12.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.24, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) during the study period. Among selected quality indicators, subjects in integrated care model group were similar to traditional model group except that integrated care model group had a significantly reduced unplanned feeding tube replacement rate. In conclusion, the clinical effectiveness of integrated care model among severly disabled LTCF residents is minimal and a further cost-effectiveness study is needed to promote optimal quality of care in this setting.",

In 59 patients (42.4%) no specific pathology could be found. There were no statistically significant differences between elderly and non-elderly patients according to the diagnostic groups. Elevated ESRs, while more prevalent in the elderly than in younger individuals, have a similar pathological significance.

     "abstract": "It could be shown using the in vitro cell culture aging model, that elastase-type endopeptidase activity is progressively upregulated with successive passages (in vitro aging). Similar results were obtained previously by determining elastase-type activity as a function of age in aorta extracts (human) and skin extracts (mouse). Among the possible mechanisms involved we tested the role of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) on this process. AGE-production was shown to increase with age, exemplified by the exponential age-dependent crosslinking of collagen, demonstrated by Fritz Verz\u00e1r, already in 1963. Several AGEs significantly upregulated elastase-type activity when added to the culture medium of fibroblasts. This effect appears to be mediated by some AGE-receptors as shown previously, and could be inhibited by a 5\u00a0kDa rhamnose-rich oligosaccharide (RROP-3) as well as by a fucose-rich oligosaccharide (FROP-3). When present in the culture media, RROP-3 and FROP-3 efficiently inhibited the passage-dependent upregulation of elastase-type activity expressed by human skin fibroblasts. The use of specific inhibitors and zymography suggested that matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 activation and expression are mainly involved. A detailed discussion is proposed for the interpretation of age-dependent modifications of tissues as vascular wall and skin in the light of these and related experiments, highlighting the role of several specific receptors in the mediation of the observed reactions.",

As ASAs could develop naturally in both men and women, we studied the relation between the presence of ASAs and cognitive function in AD. A total of 86 elderly were selected (46 patient with AD, 20 with mild cognitive impairment, and 20 without cognitive dysfunction) and were assessed for the presence of ASAs with neuropsychological evaluation.

Pre- and post-ASD closure pulmonary artery pressure (Pap), and the New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional capacity class were recorded from medical records. Almost 77% improvement in Pap and 57% improvement in functional status were found. More than 70% reported low/mild depressive symptoms and 59% reported low/mild anxiety in both groups. Almost 78% of ASD patients and 89% of controls reported high/very high levels of HRQoL. Significantly better QoL was reported by the controls. Lower post-ASD closure Pap scores were associated with better QoL, but were not significantly related to levels of depression and anxiety scores. Preoccupation with the ASD closure was related to higher pre-closure Pap scores, worse QoL, and higher depressive and anxiety symptoms. Following ASD closure, depression and anxiety symptoms were in the low range, and HRQoL scores for most patients were in the high range.",

The patients were randomly divided into two post-ICU management groups: \u201cgeriatric ward\u201d and \u201cstandard care\u201d.

Fifty elderly females performed an STS movement twice from a chair adjusted to their knee height and the GRF, lower limb muscle mass and isometric knee extension muscle strength were measured. Reliabilities of GRF parameters were high (intra-class correlation coefficient\u00a0=\u00a0ICC\u00a0=\u00a00.70\u20130.95). Parameters on force output during trunk flexion phase (ground reaction force at hip-lift off, sum of force output between beginning of STS movement and hip-lift off) differed significantly between trials, but their effect sizes were small (0.15\u20130.23). GRF parameters during hip-lift off and knee\u2013hip joint extension phases significantly correlated with knee extension strength (|r|\u00a0=\u00a00.29\u20130.64) but not lower limb muscle mass.

French guidelines recommend the Cockcroft-Gault formula corrected with the body surface area (cCG), but the initially described unadjusted Cockcroft-Gault equation (CG) is mainly used in geriatric clinical practice. International recommendations have proposed the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) formula, since several authors recommended the Rule formula using cystatin C (cystC) in particular population. To appreciate the most accurate GFR estimation for posology adaptation in an elderly polypathological population, a cross-sectional study with prospective inclusion was carried out in Charles Foix Hospital. Plasma glucose levels (PGL), creatinine (CREA) levels and serum cystC, albumin (ALB), transthyretin (TTR), C-reactive protein (CRP), orosomucoid (ORO) total cholesterol (tCHOL) levels were determined among 193 elderly patients aged 70 and older. The results showed that in a malnourished, inflammed old population, CG, MDRD and Rule formulae resulted in different estimations of GFR, depending on nutritional and inflammatory parameters. Only cCG estimation was shown to be independent from these parameters. To conclude, cCG seems to be the most accurate and appropriate formula in a polypathological elderly population to evaluate renal function in order to adapt drug posology.",

None of the variables individually was significant when tested using either Cox-regression via ENTER method or Kaplan\u2013Meier test.

     "abstract": "Many research studies have demonstrated asymptomatic white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in older adults, which are postulated to be ischemic in origin. We hypothesized that certain clinical predictors, measured in a population of healthy older adults, would have a positive relationship with WMH scoring on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As part of a longitudinal study of cognitive aging we have performed MRI on healthy older adults. In a group of 46 volunteers (25 females; median age 73, range 63\u201384 years), we have calculated of the Hachinski score and Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (FSRP). Volunteers also provided self-reported health information using the Cornell Medical Index (CMI). These were compared against the total Age Related White Matter Changes (ARWMC) score. The mean total ARWMC score was 7.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.27 (\u00b1S.D.) and only 3 (6.5%) individuals had no evidence of WMH. Regression analysis of individual variables identified self-report of cardiovascular disease from the CMI, section C as the only significant predictor of ARWMC. A multivariate linear regression model also identified FSRP at 1 year as a second independently significant predictor. The multivariate model accounted for 19% of the variance in total ARWMC score. The only 6.5% of individuals who had no WMH is in keeping with previous studies. The important finding was the positive relationship with self-reported cardiovascular disease, which is a possible biomarker of sub-clinical cerebrovascular disease (CVD).",

The aim of this study was to identify the anthropometric characteristics of the feet of elderly women with and without arthritis. This is an observational transversal study. The right and left feet of 227 older women aged between 60 and 90 years (69.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8 years) were evaluated, of whom 45 reported a diagnosis of arthritis (non-osteoarthritis). The anthropometric evaluation of the feet comprised the variables of width, perimeter, height, foot length, first and fifth metatarsophalangeal angles, the arch-index and the foot posture index (FPI). The data were analyzed using the analysis of probability to compare the groups (arthritic and non-arthritic women). The differences between the means were significant in the case of the FPI and some of its criteria, such as the calcaneal frontal plane position, the bulge in the region of the talo-navicular joint and the forefoot alignment. The width of the right foot was also significantly greater in the women with arthritis. These results are preliminary findings that may help direct larger studies of foot characteristics among older adults with arthritis.",

We selected two demographic variables, five physiological variables, 11 primary diseases or geriatric syndromes, and four psychosocial variables as possible confounding factors of ADL limitations and correlates of going outdoors. After adjusting for the confounders, multiple logistic regression showed that limitations in basic ADL and instrumental ADL were most strongly associated with going outside the home less than once a week and with going into the neighborhood less than once a week, respectively. Low self-efficacy for going outdoors related most strongly to restrictions in these outdoor activities.

This report is based on the intervention/treatment arm (n\u00a0=\u00a045) of a randomized controlled trial in older women who participated in a multidisciplinary clinic. We describe the development of a clinical pathway for HF and the variance reporting including factors affecting adherence with the pathway. Variances are patient or staff actions that did not meet the expected outcomes. Of the 45 intervention arm female patients, 5 were able to fully complete the program, meaning that all of the intended 12 visits were completed successfully. Thirteen women missed more than three clinic visits, and the rest attended most visits. Variance tracking identified that visits were interrupted most often by patient-related health issues, such as fatigue and pain, which may not be surprising given the expected multiple co-morbidities in this population. Transportation problems were identified as a barrier to attendance. Our study demonstrates that a clinical pathway can be implemented in an older, female population with HF. This report identifies some of the challenges and provides future recommendations for prospective pathway development.",

The discriminative validity was assessed in a sample of 37 subjects with SMC, 50 patients with A-MCI according to the Petersen-criteria, and 66 patients with mild AD (global deterioration scale: 4 stage) according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. M@T mean scores were significantly different among groups: 39.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1 (\u00b1S.D.) in the SMC group, 31.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9 in the A-MCI group, and 21.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9 in mild AD. A cut-off score of 37 points had a sensitivity of 96% and a specificity of 70% to differentiate A-MCI from SMC (ABC\u00a0=\u00a00.88). A cut-off score of 33 points had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 86% to differentiate mild AD from SMC sample (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.99).

Treatment is offered according to biological age alone and life expectancy, comorbidity and functional status are not considered when deciding treatment strategy.

From January 2002 to December 2007, 51 consecutive patients (43 men and 8 women) aged \u226565 received RT for locally advanced lung cancer, 22 with radical intent and 16 in adjuvant setting. Thirty-six patients received chemotherapy. Variables considered were age, co-morbidities, evaluated according to the adult co-morbidity evaluation index (ACE-27), surgery vs. no surgery, radiation dose and chemotherapy. The median age was 74.7 years (range 65\u201391). Of the patients, 15.7% had no co-morbidity, 41.2% mild, 25.5% moderate, and 17.6% had severe co-morbidities. Sixteen subjects (31.4%) underwent surgery. All patients completed the planned radiation schedule, while chemotherapy was reduced in 16 patients. At a median follow-up of 22 months, the 2- and 3-year overall survival rates were 46.5% and 35.4%, respectively. Patients with no or mild co-morbidities (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and a good performance status (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) had a better survival. The actuarial progression-free survival at 2 and 3 years was 41.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Acute lung toxicity rates were different between patients with different ACE-27 indexes, whereas late toxicity was not influenced. In conclusion, in elderly patients, the compliance with RT is good and the rate of toxicity is acceptable. Patients with no or mild co-morbidities have a significantly better survival. The increasing severity of co-morbidities may sufficiently shorten the remaining life expectancy, cancel the gains obtained by RT and increase the acute lung toxicity. Further prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.",

     "abstract": "The incidence of depression in the elderly has risen in recent years, with 30% of people over the age of 65 now reported to suffer from mood disorders. There are a number of possible causes for this increase; moreover, as the symptoms of depression in the elderly are often difficult to identify and interpret, a diagnosis of depression in the elderly may be difficult to make, particularly when other concomitant pathologies mask the signs and symptoms of this disease. There is thus a need to standardize the various self-rating and hetero-evaluation scales used to differentiate between normal and depressed subjects. These tools are designed to investigate and evaluate the various components of depression in depth. They are essential for the diagnosis and therapy in patients who suffer from mood disorders, though it should be borne in mind that these tests need to be preceded and confirmed by a thorough psychiatric examination.",

There is a critical need to strengthen gerontology curricula to prepare health-related professionals for a graying population. The purpose of this article is to investigate student satisfaction with the first National Project for Excellence in Gerontological Care Education (NPEGCE) in Taiwan. A cross-sectional design was used. A sample of 151 medical, nursing, and physical therapy students, who had enrolled in the NPEGCE and had taken at least one core course, completed a satisfaction questionnaire. To ensure content validity, a multidisciplinary, institutional committee of gerontology and geriatric faculty designed the content. Overall satisfaction scores varied between satisfied (4-points) and very satisfied (5-points). Medical students gave higher ratings than others. Two factors (Curriculum and Teaching) were extracted. A strong correlation was found between the subscales and overall satisfaction scores. Internal scale consistency reliability scores ranged from 0.92 to 0.96. Overall, this study demonstrates a moderate level of satisfaction with the NPEGCE. However, these results are from a single institution; they are not generalizable. This is also the first student satisfaction report from Taiwan. There are no similar programs or evaluation results to compare them with. Since the NPEGCE was well received by students and seemed to encourage a more nurturing attitude towards the elderly; it can be regarded as a catalyst for better elderly care in the future.",

Researchers have been encouraged to examine ways of assessing SRH in cognitively impaired persons, but the validity and the influence on other factors on SRH among cognitively impaired persons remain unknown. This study reports how patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) report SRH and which factors influence SRH. The study was based on baseline data from 321 home living patients with mild AD who participated in the Danish Alzheimer Intervention Study (DAISY). Analysis using the generalized estimating equation (GEE) models revealed that good/excellent SRH among patients with mild AD were associated with longer education, lack of other chronic conditions, higher scores of quality of life (QOL), lower scores of mini mental state examination (MMSE), and loss of insight in own cognitive deficits. The present results indicate that SRH reported by patients with mild AD may differ from SRH among cognitively intact persons. Further research is needed in order to establish the validity and implication of SRH in this group of patients.",

The objective of the study is to examine the relationship between functional disabilities in women over the age of 65 and their reproductive history and socioeconomic status. This is a cross-sectional study. The study group consisted of 543 women aged 65 or over. A general questionnaire and the Brief Disability Questionnaire (BDQ) were used to collect data with face-to-face interview in home visits. Of the women 79.2% have disability. First childbirth was experienced at the average age of 19.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3 and the average age at which the women experienced their last delivery was 32.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3. Parity was 4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7. Advanced age, being widowed and illiterate, less income, being outside of the middle class and having more than four children are important determinants for later life disability. The study highlights the importance of focusing not just on the short-term effects of childbearing and socioeconomic factors, but also of taking into account the possibility of long-term effects on disability in older women.",

In the current study, we investigated the relation between protein hydroperoxide levels and other protein oxidation parameters. Our study also covered other oxidative stress parameters, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, malondialdehyde, and the redox index in brain tissue of the aged rats. Protein hydroperoxide, 4-hydroxynonenal, thiol levels of male rats were significantly higher than in the female rat group. On the other hand, other oxidative stress parameters were all found to be not different. We suggest that increased total thiol and protein thiol levels found in our study may point to an adaptive reaction to oxidative protein damage. We are of the conviction that the increased thiol groups that we have determined in aged male rats may be a limiting factor in propagation of protein oxidation, as the protein carbonyl, advanced oxidation protein products and nitrotyrosine levels in the brain tissue were unchanged. It has thus been found that gender indeed affects the oxidation of brain proteins and thus its aging; though the extent of the underlying mechanisms affecting brain aging and its etiology are still obscure.",

The participants were 3611 in number (1494 males and 2117 females) aged 60 years and over. The outcome variable was the number of missing teeth in the mouth determined by dental examination; general medical examination included blood pressure, body height and weight to compute body mass index (BMI). Laboratory investigations included aspartate transaminase (AST), hemoglobin (HB), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and total cholesterol (CHOL). Demographic factors and smoking status were obtained from questionnaires by an interviewer. Multiple regression models were used as a statistical analysis. The subjects were classified into three groups according to the number of missing teeth (<8, 8\u201318, and >18). In unadjusted analyses individuals with more missing teeth, had poorer general health status (higher blood pressure, higher levels of AST, FPG, and CHOL, and higher BMI in females). In multiple regression models with the number of missing teeth as an outcome, systolic blood pressure, CHOL, FPG, and HB in males were statistically significant after adjusting for age and smoking. In females, systolic blood pressure, CHOL, FPG, and BMI were positively associated with the number of missing teeth. The number of missing teeth was positively related to poorer general health status such as blood pressure, FPG, CHOL, after adjusting for age and smoking in the rural elderly in Korea.",

A correlation study showed which variables correlated the closest with the well-being components, then four logistic regression analyses were performed, one for each well-being component such as the positive and negative affect schedule (PANAS) positive scale, mobility satisfaction, health satisfaction and life satisfaction. High positive scores of PANAS and satisfaction scales were found both for Germany and Italy. As expected and in accordance with previous studies, components utilized as a measure of subjective well-being correlated significantly with each other in both countries, confirming their validity as instruments of evaluation for several different life domains. A considerable result of this study was that the driving car is an important predictor of well-being in both countries. The findings underlined a variety of associations among the mobility resources and the subjective perception of well-being. Our work supports the importance of being aware of the main variables influencing the positive dimension of well-being for creating a better understanding the needs and goals of older people.

The interactive effect between systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, and DBP, respectively) and ApoE on cognition was not significant (all p\u00a0>\u00a00.3), but the interactive effect between triglyceride (TG), high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDLc) and ApoE on cognition was significant after adjustment for age, sex, and education (B\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.285, Wald\u00a0=\u00a04.194, p\u00a0=\u00a00.041; B\u00a0=\u00a00.372, Wald\u00a0=\u00a04.134, p\u00a0=\u00a00.042). These results suggest that blood TG and HDLc may affect cognitive function in the elderly in the presence of ApoE \u025b4 allele.",

The characteristics of 70 elderly people who visited the outpatient department because of a fall in the period from May 2005 till February 2007 were evaluated. The effectiveness of the falls-assessment was evaluated by telephone interview of those individuals who had attended the falls-assessment. Fifty-three patients (mean age\u00a0=\u00a079.8 years) were interviewed after a mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0S.D. of 1.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.41 years (ranging 0.72\u20132.34 years) subsequent to the falls-assessment. Falls-assessment led to significantly fewer falls, from 3.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.66 at the time of the assessment at baseline to 1.10\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.86 at the time of the interview (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000041). Fear of falling was also significantly diminished. In conclusion, falls-assessment leads to fewer falls and less fear of falling among elderly individuals.",

However, it remains uncertain whether incontinence or behavioral symptoms are associated with recurrent falls and injurious falls. The purpose of this research was to examine the association between various types of falls and urinary incontinence or behavioral symptoms among the residents of long-term care facilities using the Cox proportional hazards models. The participants were 1082 older people (327 men and 755 women) who were admitted to facilities between 1 April 2003 and 31 March 2004. Fall experience, urinary incontinence, and behavioral symptoms were followed for up to 6 months or until death or discharge. The functional status, comorbidity, and prescribed medications were determined at the baseline. Multivariate analysis revealed that urinary incontinence and behavioral symptoms were independent risk factors of falls during the follow-up period. However, urinary incontinence was a risk factor for recurrent falls but not for injurious falls. In contrast, behavioral symptoms were an independent risk factor for injurious but not for recurrent falls. The results suggested that treatment or management of urinary incontinence and behavioral symptoms should be considered to prevent falls in long-term care settings.",

The incidence of hip fracture increases substantially with age. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between gender and geriatric rehabilitation outcome after traumatic hip fracture.

We assessed the patients\u2019 clinical and demographic data, preoperative risk (ASA), type of fracture and orthopedic repair, pain intensity (VAS), cognitive (MMSE), mood (Zung IDS), and functional status (FIM) on admission and at the end of geriatric rehabilitation. Men had higher mean number of comorbid conditions at the time of the fracture. Men recovered more from depressed mood in comparison with women during the rehabilitation. Significant improvement in FIM motor subscore on discharge was found in both groups. The FIM motor subscore gain was higher in men (24.47) in comparison with women (19.22, p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). Those differences were demonstrated in mean subscores of transfers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and locomotion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). Women were more functionally dependent in locomotion, transfers and sphincter control. There were no differences between the groups by duration on rehabilitation stay. Recovery after hip fracture depends in large part on the pre-fracture health and functional ability of the patient. Gender differences in functional recovery may affect therapeutic and rehabilitative decision making. Functional recovery after traumatic hip fracture was better in men in comparison with women.",

The validated mini-PPT was then used to predict total PPT score and functional physical status in participants with mild dementia. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses were used to generate a cutoff score that classifies participants as functional vs. not functional. The setting was in the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (Washington University). A total of 1199 participants met inclusion criteria: 574 non-demented participants, 436 with very mild dementia, measured by the clinical dementia rating (CDR)\u00a0=\u00a00.5 and 189 with mild dementia (CDR\u00a0=\u00a01). The mean age of the sample was 76.4 years, mean educational attainment was 14 years, 58% were women, and 11% were African American. A 4-item scale, the mini-PPT, was developed (based on the results of multiple regression analyses and clinical meaningfulness) that highly correlated with total PPT score (r\u00a0=\u00a00.917, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in the non-demented sample. The correlation of the mini-PPT with total PPT was 0.90 among those with very mild, and 0.91 among those with mild dementia. Using the ROCs, a cutoff score of 12 correctly classified at least 85% of non-demented and demented persons.

Recent clinical studies have tried to correlate the plasma levels of these biomarkers with severity of the disease. To evaluate the role of NT-pro-BNP, TNF-\u03b1 and C-reactive protein (CRP) in a population of geriatric patients affected by CHF, and to assess their different plasma levels in diabetics and in normoglycemic patients, we enrolled 57 patients affected by CHF: 29 patients were diabetic and 28 were normoglycemic. Clinical and echocardiographic examinations were performed in all patients, in order to evaluate the NYHA-class and the left ventricular ejection fraction (EF). All of them had been stabilized with medical therapy from at least 3 weeks. Plasma NT-pro-BNP, TNF-\u03b1 and CRP levels were measured in each recruited patient. In the whole population we observed a linear correlation between NT-pro-BNP levels, EF and NYHA-class (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but there was no significant correlation between TNF-\u03b1 or CRP and the clinical or echocardiographic data (p\u00a0=\u00a00.588 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.9, respectively). Finally we evaluated, if there were significant differences in the biomarker concentrations between diabetics and normoglycemics. Both the clinical and the echocardiographic parameters of systolic dysfunction were comparable in these two groups. We observed a significant difference in CRP levels between the two groups (3.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.85 in diabetics vs. 1.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.35 in normoglycemics; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Since today it is still not possible to obtain the diagnosis with laboratory methods of clinical genetics, we tried to identify the subjects of risk of future diabetes on the basis of a combined measurement of glycemia, the glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and the waist circumference (WC). The studied population consisted of 2603 elderly subjects of 65\u201384 years of age, involved in the epidemiological study called ILSA (Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging). The subjects who displayed at the baseline an impaired fasting glucose (IFG) accompanied by HbA1c and WC values above the normal cut-points proved to be diabetic after a 3-year follow-up in 18.96%, while the subjects with normal fasting glucose (NFG) accompanied by normal HbA1c and WC values were found to be diabetic only in 1.34%. It means that the presence of abnormal values of these 3 parameters in the elderly does not allow the identification of the risks for future diabetes in the great majority of subjects. We conclude that the results of prospective studies may gain particular significance not only regarding the glycemia, but also the other 2 risk factors, if we wish to reach not only a predictive diagnosis of risk for diabetes, but also to prevent the chronic degenerative complications of it.",

Baseline data, which included demographic characteristics, mini mental status exam, geriatric depression scale (GDS), mini nutritional assessment (MNA), activities of daily living (ADL), and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), were collected in geriatric assessments. The primary outcome was functional deterioration; additional outcomes included mortality, re-hospitalization, and emergency department visits, as identified by telephone interview and chart review. A total of 1,008 patients were recruited: 31.2% of the participants were ADL intact, 21.3% were IADL-intact, 11.5% had depression, 29.3% had nutritional problems, and 60.3% had impaired cognition at baseline. During follow-up, 172 patients (19.3%) died, 43.8% reported ADL deterioration, and 45.9% reported IADL deterioration. On multivariate analysis, older age, low mini mental state examination (MMSE) score, and low MNA score were predictors of functional deterioration. Under the interdisciplinary team care of the Community Hospital Reform Plan (CHRP), most of the elderly patients maintained or increased their functional capacity; the one-year mortality rate was higher than that of the general population but lower than that of other studies targeting the frail elderly.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of depression in late life and to explore associated risk factors among Taiwanese elderly. The analyses were based on nationally representative data from the Survey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in 1999 and 2003. A total of 1,487 respondents aged 65 years and older who completed the 10-item Center for Epidemiological Survey Depression (CES-D) scale in these two surveys and without depression in 1999 were included in the final analyses. Depression was defined as a CES-D score equal to or greater than 10. The independent variables included sociodemographic characteristics, occurrence of new diseases, social support, perceived health and financial stresses, life satisfaction, and functional condition. The incidence rate of depression over 4 years was 19.7%. Multivariate regression analyses revealed that women who perceived greater health or financial stress and who had greater life dissatisfaction or worsened functional condition were more likely to suffer depression. These findings imply that healthcare programs for older adults should include cognitive and behavioral interventions in order to prevent the development of depression in late life.",

     "abstract": "This randomized, controlled trial assessed the effectiveness of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and subsequent intervention in pre-frail and frail community-dwelling elderly based on the Fried Frailty Criteria (FFC) and the Barthel Index (BI) A total of 310 pre-frail or frail elderly from a single community were identified using the FFC. Of these, 152 were randomly assigned to the intervention group for CGA and appropriate intervention by medication adjustment, exercise instruction, nutrition support, physical rehabilitation, social worker consultation, and specialty referral. Clinical outcome was re-evaluated by the FFC and BI 6 months later. Compared to the control group, the intervention group tended to have a better outcome, with an odds ratio (OR) = 1.19, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0.48\u20133.04, p = 0.71) and 3.29 (95% CI = 0.65\u201316.64, p = 0.15), respectively, and were less likely to deteriorate, with an OR = 0.78 (95% CI = 0.34\u20131.79, p = 0.57) and 0.94 (95% CI = 0.42\u20132.12, p = 0.88), respectively. Although no significant differences were observed, the CGA and subsequent intervention showed a favorable outcome in frail and pre-frail elderly based on the frailty status and BI. Inability to complete the CGA and poor compliance with the intervention program appear to be the main reasons for unfavorable outcomes.",

A nationwide probability sample including 2,238 individuals aged \u226565 years was interviewed in 2003. Based on the Cardiovascular Health Study conducted by Fried, five phenotypes of frailty were selected: poor appetite, exhaustion, low physical activity, poor walking ability, and poor twisting ability of fingers. Participants were classified as nonfrail, prefrail, and frail if they met 0, 1 or 2, and \u22653 criteria. The prevalences of nonfrailty, prefrailty, and frailty were 55.1%, 40.0%, and 4.9%, respectively. The prevalence of frailty increased with age and was greater in women. Frailty was associated with less education, no spouse, disability, higher rates of comorbid chronic diseases, depressive symptoms, and geriatric syndromes. Specific drug use, such as hypnotics, analgesics, herbal drugs, and parenteral fluid supplements was positively associated with frailty. The use of multivitamins, fish oil, and vitamin E was negatively associated with frailty. The prevalence of frailty is lower in Taiwan than in Western countries. Depressive symptoms, geriatric syndromes, and specific medication use are potential fields for frailty prevention in community-dwelling older adults.",

     "abstract": "BMI change and BMI at an early age have not been investigated as risks for dementia. This case-control study included 286 dementia patients and 268 controls from two medical centers between 2007 and 2009. BMI information was collected from medical records and questionnaires. Men and women with low BMIs at the time of the study, in their 20s, and in their 40s had significantly increased risks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) (odds ratio = OR = 2.62\u20133.97) and increased vascular dementia (VaD) risk (20s and 40s: OR = 6.23\u201311.11) compared with those with normal BMIs. High BMI in the 20s and 40s was associated with increased VaD risk (OR = 15.29 and 10.32) among women. For BMI changes from the 20s or 40s, the second and third tertiles were significantly associated with decreased AD risk among women (OR = 0.15\u20130.35) compared to the first tertile. The third tertile of BMI change from the 20s or 40s was associated with decreased VaD risk among women (OR = 0.06 and 0.14). Low BMIs in the 20s and 40s were stronger predictors of AD and VaD. There was a U-shaped association between BMI at different ages and dementia among participants with VaD.",

     "abstract": "This study aimed to identify the risk factors for cognitive impairment among the elderly population in Taiwan. Data were drawn from three waves of the \u201cSurvey of Health and Living Status of the Elderly in Taiwan\u201d, a national longitudinal study started in 1989. We included respondents without dementia or cognitive impairment at baseline in 1993 and followed them over a 10-year period. Cognitive function was measured by the nine-item Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire in 1993, 1999, and 2003. Independent variables, including age, sex, marital status, education, ethnicity, ADLs, IADLs, physical function, social participation, chronic diseases, smoking, and alcohol drinking, were collected at baseline in 1993. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 10-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the predictive factors for cognitive impairment. Of the eligible 1,626 respondents, 72 (4.43%) and 484 (29.77%) individuals did not complete follow-up in 1999 and 2003, respectively, mostly due to death. Our results showed that older age (OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.79\u20133.78), being female, lower educational level, IADL disability (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.38\u20133.09), and having a history of diabetes (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.06\u20132.74) or stroke (OR = 2.36, 95% CI = 1.06\u20135.26) were independent predictors for cognitive impairment in Taiwan.",
