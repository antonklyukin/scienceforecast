     "abstract": "Egg freezing was initially used as an intervention for iatrogenic ovarian insufficiency. Nowadays, it is not considered an experimental procedure, and it is increasingly popular among healthy women who wish to maintain their reproductive potential (fertility preservation). This review summarises the evidence on egg freezing technology, reproductive outcomes and long-term effects, as well as its psychological and socioeconomic implications. Egg freezing technology is advancing, with vitrification being the current method of choice, due to its effectiveness. The reproductive outcomes following egg freezing appear to be promising, though the strong negative association with maternal age has to be taken into consideration. Unfortunately, data on long-term outcomes are missing, raising safety issues. Egg freezing has several socioeconomic implications involving health risks, as well as financial and psychological factors.",

     "abstract": "Whether endogenous testosterone concentrations are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) development is not well established. We assessed the association between plasma total testosterone concentrations and incident AF in a population-based longitudinal study.Using data from the prospective Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, we identified incident AF among 9282 participants who had plasma total testosterone measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry at Visit 4 (1996\u20131998).AF cases were identified by electrocardiograms performed during study visits, hospital records/discharge codes, and death certificates through 2013. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for incident AF across quartiles of plasma total testosterone, stratified by sex, with multivariable Cox models.The mean age of the participant sample at ARIC Visit 4 was 63 years (range 52\u201375); 54.5% were women. Mean (SD) plasma total testosterone levels were 537\u2009ng/dL (213) for men and 27.6\u2009ng/dL (34.7) for women. Over a mean of 13.7 years of follow-up, 1664 incident cases of AF were identified. Comparing those in the highest quartile of plasma total testosterone concentration to those in the lowest quartile and after adjustment for potential confounding variables, there was a positive association between plasma total testosterone and incident AF in men (HR 1.33, 95% CI 1.07, 1.66), but no such association in women (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80, 1.22).Conclusion A higher plasma total testosterone concentration was associated with a modestly greater incidence rate of AF in men.",

Patient charts were retrospectively reviewed and clinical variables were extracted. Descriptive statistics were prepared and analyses were performed.The main outcome measures were complications and rate of malignancy.From 2007\u20132017, 61 postmenopausal women with TOAs were identified. Their median age was 62 years (range 50\u201387 years). Many of the women presenting with TOAs had co-morbidities; 34.4% had diverticulosis or diverticulitis and 9.8% had diabetes. Among the 61 women, 19 (31.1%) underwent interventional radiology (IR) drainage. Most postmenopausal women presenting with a TOA underwent surgical intervention (n\u2009=\u200947, 77.1%). Thirty-three (54.1%) women underwent early surgery (within 30 days), and 14 (22.9%) underwent late surgery (after 30 days). Overall, 14 (29.8%) women had either an intra-operative or a post-operative complication. Post-operative complications were more common among women who underwent late surgery than among those who underwent early surgery (35.7% vs 9.1%, P\u2009=\u20090.04). However, there was no difference in the readmission rate within 30 days of surgery (P\u2009=\u20091.0) or in the overall complication rate (P\u2009=\u20090.24) between surgery groups. Eight women (13.1%) had malignancy diagnosed either pre-operatively or at the time of their presentation with a TOA.Postmenopausal women presenting with TOAs often undergo surgical procedures that have a high rate of complications and may be associated with malignancy.",

     "abstract": "This is a scoping review of the notions of authenticity and citizenship in the context of understanding dementia. Authenticity suggests being true to yourself. Social citizenship suggests engagement, relationships and rights. The literature which links authenticity to dementia is scanty, albeit the notion suggests numerous possibilities. The literature on citizenship and dementia is more extensive. After some conceptual discussion, the literature is reviewed. The authenticity literature focuses on people being themselves, on partnerships and on decision-making. There is also literature on how carers of people living with dementia might be more authentic or genuine. Over against the possibility that the demands of citizenship might swamp the drive to individual authenticity, the review shows that, in line with authenticity being a social virtue, it is implied or conveyed by much of the literature on citizenship, in particular by the characterization of citizenship in terms of coherence (and thus narrative), vitality, maturity and depth.",

     "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common disorder, in which loss of pharyngeal dilator muscle tone during sleep causes recurrent collapse of the upper airway and temporary cessation of breathing. Repeated apneas and hypopneas lead to cycles of intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia, increased negative intrathoracic pressure and arousals from sleep. These consequences of OSA are associated with a cascade of cardiovascular and neurohumoral consequences, including sympathetic nervous system hyperactivity, raised heart rate variability, increases in blood pressure, myocardial wall stress, oxidative stress, systemic inflammation, platelet aggregation and impaired vascular endothelial function, which contribute, in turn, to increased cardiovascular risk and, in particular, to the development of chronic systemic arterial hypertension and arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation (AF). Given that the prevalence of OSA is modified by age and gender, OSA-related cardiovascular diseases may also be affected by the same factors. This review focuses on the potential role of OSA in systemic arterial hypertension and AF, and discusses the most interesting studies on age and gender as predisposing factors.",

     "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic and common adult disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of upper-airway obstruction and reopening during sleep. OSA is associated with intermittent hypoxia, sympathetic overactivity, oxidative stress and high cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. It is known to be more common in men than women, partly due to differences in anatomy and functional respiratory components. There are also gender differences in reported symptoms, leading to potential under-diagnosis in females. This gender difference tends to decrease after menopause, demonstrating a role of menopausal status itself in OSA phenotypes. Aging, fat mass distribution, sex hormones and upper-airway collapsibility are postulated to play a major role in these findings. This review focuses on the most recent studies exploring gender differences in the prevalence, pathogenesis and clinical features of OSA. It discusses the role of menopause in this, and explore the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.",

     "publication date": "06-2019",
     "abstract": "Achieving appropriate medication is a multidimensional process. Current research on polypharmacy mainly focuses on drug appropriateness, but little is devoted to what determines the ongoing challenge. The authors, with their diverse clinical, pharmaceutical and regulatory backgrounds, offer a narrative review on the causes of inappropriate polypharmacy and how to avoid it. Inappropriate polypharmacy may stem from the systematic exclusion of frail older patients from landmark randomised controlled trials, which has prevented the accurate establishment of the clinical benefits of a drug for that ever-growing group of patients. Nonetheless, what may determine the usefulness of a drug in a specific patient cohort is its design. Patient-centric drug product development must, therefore, account for older people\u2019s characteristics, so that drugs are better formulated from their inception. This novel drug development process has significant implications for industry and requires adequate regulation. Clinicians must understand and be part of drug development. Explicit criteria such as STOPP/START provide guidance on identifying opportunities and circumstances to review medication but achieving appropriateness is far more complicated. New healthcare technology may pave the way to better-tailored interventions at a healthcare system level, but patient and advocate voices, as well as communication and continuity of care, must remain at the core. In conclusion, inappropriate polypharmacy results from the combination of multiple factors. Achieving appropriate medication for older adults requires merging different disciplines and a focus on patients\u2019 needs and expectations.",

The rates of sexual distress and vulvar atrophy were higher in the non-hormonal treatment group. No significant differences were found according to treatment duration.Postmenopausal women with VVA receiving treatment complained of more severe symptoms than those untreated. Women on systemic treatment had fewer and milder VVA symptoms and presented with better vaginal and vulvar health than women on other treatments. Many women request effective local treatment too late, when VVA symptoms are already severe. Our data suggest that VVA treatments should ideally be initiated when symptoms commence and cause distress, rather than later, when symptoms may have become more severe and even a cause of intolerable distress for the woman.",

We hypothesize that acupuncture, when compared with a sham intervention, will reduce the duration and severity of delirium, normalize delirium biomarkers, and improve clinical outcomes related to delirium in acutely hospitalized older adults with a medical illness.This three-arm, prospective, randomized, clinical trial will evaluate adults aged over 65 years who are acutely hospitalized to an internal-medicine ward and diagnosed with delirium or subsyndromal delirium. The 288 patients (96 in each of three groups) will be randomly allocated to receive either daily true acupuncture with usual care, a daily sham procedure with usual care, or usual care only in a 1:1:1 distribution for up to one week or until the patient is delirium-free for over 48\u202fh.

Delirium will be diagnosed using DSM-5 criteria and its severity will be assessed using the long Confusion Assessment Method Severity (CAM-S) tool.The primary study outcome will be the daily CAM-S score over 7 days between the three groups. Secondary outcomes will include time to first resolution of the delirium (over 7 days), the proportion of days spent delirium-free, daily antipsychotic use, daily pain scores, sleep quality, morning serum cortisol and T3 levels, and midnight urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio, all determined twice a week, and delirium-related complications. Hospital mortality, duration of hospital stay and functional status at discharge will also be compared between the three groups. Adverse events potentially related to acupuncture will be evaluated daily. The cost-effectiveness of acupuncture will be estimated.This novel randomized study will evaluate both the specific and the non-specific effects of acupuncture on delirium, and related outcomes, and its safety. Potential mechanism(s) of action for acupuncture in reducing delirium will be explored and healthcare-related costs estimated. Positive study results may prove pivotal in facilitating a multimodal, non-pharmacologic, integrative approach to delirium treatment among older, medical inpatients.",

Overall numbers of carers are growing but numbers of older carers are increasing particularly rapidly as populations age worldwide. However, little research has focused on this important older group. This qualitative study therefore investigated older carers\u2019 experiences and their perceptions of their role.Five digitally recorded focus groups with carers from Greater London were undertaken. Recordings were transcribed and analysed thematically.Forty-four carers aged 70\u201387 years participated. Most were female and two-thirds were spouses or partners. Overall, the carers thought their experiences were similar to those of younger adult carers and included both satisfying and challenging facets. However, they thought that some of the more negative aspects of the role were more difficult for older carers. Their own declining physical and emotional health and strength were seen as making it harder to access support and maintain social contacts. Loneliness both outside and within relationships featured prominently and was perceived as especially significant for housebound carers and when caring for someone with dementia. Many of these older carers also worried about the future when they might no longer be able to be a carer due to their own ill-health or death.Older carers find their role challenging and future investigations should focus on identifying means of reducing their isolation and supporting them with planning for the future.",

     "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests a bidirectional relationship exists between levels of health literacy (HL) and cognitive impairment in later life. However, it is unclear whether low levels of HL can lead to a higher risk of dementia. This systematic review explored prospective cohort studies to find out whether HL is a risk factor for incident dementia in older adults. A search was conducted in Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, PubMed and Scopus and 5450 documents were initially retrieved. The grey literature and references of the selected papers were also consulted. Papers were selected and assessed by three researchers independently. Findings were reported in line with the PRISMA guidelines and quality appraisal was conducted using the STROBE checklist. Four studies were included for quality appraisal, data extraction and synthesis, all of which were conducted in the United States between 2014 and 2018. Adjusted analyses showed that in all studies people with low levels of HL had a significantly higher risk of incident dementia over time than people with adequate levels of HL. Low HL or total literacy (financial plus HL) was also a risk factor for mild cognitive impairment in two studies, irrespective of an Alzheimer\u2019s disease genotype. There was a statistically significant positive association between total literacy scores and the post-mortem amount of plaques and tangles suggestive of Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Our findings suggest that low levels of HL might lead to higher future dementia risk. However, as only a few longitudinal studies have been conducted in this area, further research is needed to establish the role of HL as a key risk factor for dementia.

     "abstract": "Direct involvement in creative activities can have benefits in terms of improved attention and positive engagement for older people. We used the social return on investment (SROI) approach to explore the social and economic benefits of arts activities for older people living in residential homes in England.We complied with the CHEERS checklist and followed the six stages of SROI as reported in the literature.We identified three main stakeholders: care home residents, care home personnel, and activity co-ordinators. For residents, the outcomes of interest were: community inclusion, mental and physical health, improved cognition and decreased social isolation. For care home personnel and activity co-ordinators the outcomes were: improved skills in caring for older people and increased confidence in using arts interventions. The analysis yielded an SROI of \u00a31.20 for every \u00a31 of expenditure. The sensitivity analysis revealed that when we consider a displacement rate of 15% for all the outcomes of all participating stakeholders, the Imagine study is unlikely to report a ratio that is less than \u00a31.02 for every \u00a31.00 invested.Findings could inform policy decisions about investment in the arts and health or social care.",

NAFLD is commonly seen in individuals with metabolic abnormalities, such as obesity and insulin resistance, which are closely associated with sarcopenia. Sarcopenia, defined as low muscle mass and impaired muscle function, is associated with NAFLD and worse outcomes in patients with NAFLD. As the world\u2019s elderly population and the prevalence of obesity continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, NAFLD and sarcopenia are projected to increase. Given that there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for NAFLD, it is imperative to gain a better understanding of the disease pathophysiology, to guide treatment options. Recent studies have given new insight into sarcopenic obesity, but there is no consensus on its definition. In this review, we attempt to address the impact of sarcopenia and obesity on NAFLD, especially in the elderly population.",

As there is an important variation in risk among women in this age group, we need to tailor risk assessment by using additional risk parameters during their life-course. For this, valuable tools are family risk, female-specific risk factors and inflammatory co-morbidities, which can be enriched by measuring the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score using computerized tomography. Depending on the results, we can readily adapt lifestyle advice and preventive treatment to every individual woman. Progress has been made in the recognition of stable and unstable manifestations of ischemic heart disease in middle-aged women. Whereas the traditional cardiovascular risk factors are involved in classic obstructive coronary disease, female-specific risk variables, inflammatory co-morbidities and psychosocial stress are also involved in other types of ischemic disease. We therefore need a more sex- and gender-sensitive way to look at women\u2019s cardiovascular health.",

     "abstract": "Insomnia is a common and recurring condition during the menopausal transition that negatively affects both quality of life and health. Peri-menopausal insomnia has a multifactorial etiology; previous depression, hormonal changes and age/hormone-related irregularity in circadian rhythms can contribute to menopausal insomnia. Age-related poor health, pain and stress may favor the development of insomnia, while vasomotor symptoms, in particular hot flashes, may contribute to chronic forms of insomnia by activating a vicious cycle. Insomnia increases two- to threefold the risk of developing depressive symptoms during the peri-menopause. In fact, the menopausal transition is a window of vulnerability for the development of depressive symptoms, in which the risk of a major depressive disorder is 2\u20134 times greater than in the premenopausal period. Depression naturally has a negative impact on daily functioning, quality of life and health. Since the relationship between insomnia and depressive symptoms has been shown to be bidirectional, the aim of this review is to provide a brief overview of their association in the context of the menopausal transition. By exploring the potential pathways of their bidirectional relationship, this overview should be useful for preventive and therapeutic purposes. By treating insomnia we may be able to interrupt the self-reinforcing feedback loop with depressive symptoms, and thereby improve affective symptoms and women\u2019s wellbeing in this period of their life.",

The proliferative effects of dydrogesterone and of progesterone were assessed in vitro using T47D cells transfected with PGRMC1 or empty vector in the presence or absence of estradiol. Additionally, to find the strongest proliferator for inclusion as a comparator in the xenograft animal study, norethisterone, levonorgestrel, desogestrel, dienogest, drospirenone, nomegestrol, and cyproterone acetate were tested.Xenograft main study. PGRMC1-transfected or empty-vector T47D and MCF7 xenotransplants were each treated with four different hormonal preparations: E2+placebo; E2+dydrogesterone; E2+progesterone; E2+norethisterone. A total of 112 castrated mice were randomly allocated to the 16 groups. This was thus a prospective, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled four-arm study (45\u201350 days) with the two T47D and two MCF7 xenografts. Tumor volumes were monitored twice weekly.In-vitro study. The strongest proliferation was with norethisterone, but only with PGRMC1-transfected cells. There was significant proliferation with dydrogesterone, but not with progesterone in the absence of estradiol. However, no increase in proliferation was achieved by adding dydrogesterone to estradiol compared with the proliferation induced with estradiol alone, in contrast to norethisterone.Xenograft main study. There was significantly faster tumor growth with norethisterone\u2009+\u2009E2 than with E2+placebo in T47D and MCF7 PGRMC1 xenografts, but not with dydrogesterone\u2009+\u2009E2 or progesterone\u2009+\u2009E2. There was less tumor growth in empty-vector xenografts, without between-group differences.PGRMC1 increases the breast-cell proliferation effects of certain progestogens, including dydrogesterone, in contrast to progesterone, but not during estradiol-induced proliferation, either in vitro or in a xenograft animal model, in contrast to norethisterone. Thus the proliferative potency of dydrogesterone may be similar to that of progesterone. Clinical studies in women overexpressing PGRMC1 are recommended.",

Physical activity and sedentary time were assessed with a wrist-worn accelerometer. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) was determined by a maximum treadmill test using indirect calorimetry. Lower- and upper-body muscular strength were assessed by an isokinetic strength test and by the hand grip strength test, respectively. The S-Klotho plasma levels were measured in the EDTA plasma using a solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Based on the principal-component analysis, overall physical activity, moderate and vigorous physical activity levels, and sedentary time (as outcomes included in the \u2018sedentary time and physical activity\u2019 category) explained a total of 17.5% of the cumulative variance in S-Klotho plasma levels, while extension peak torque, hand grip strength, and maximal oxygen uptake (as outcomes included in the \u2018physical fitness\u2019 category) explained a total of 15.5% of the cumulative variance in S-Klotho plasma levels. Based on the loading of variables in these 2 categories, the percentage of the cumulative variance in S-Klotho plasma level explained was 28.9%s; this reached 33.0% of cumulative variance when sex was included in the model.In summary, our results indicate that physical activity and physical fitness levels are associated with S-Klotho plasma levels in middle-aged sedentary adults.

Data collection included anthropometric measurements, blood analytics, and objective and subjective measurements of PA from accelerometers and Yale PA Survey questionnaires, respectively.Although the questionnaire indicated a higher summary index (total units) of PA in men than in women, objective measurements of total PA (mean counts per minute and steps per day) did not differ by sex. However, we obtained different results between women and men when we analyzed the relation between objective and subjective PA parameters and CVRF. In women, parameters that indicate cardiovascular risk, such as body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), glucose, and total cholesterol, negatively correlated with objective PA parameters, while HDLc positively correlated with objective PA parameters and negatively with subjective PA parameters. In men, BMI and WC were negatively correlated with objective PA parameters, while blood cholesterol, LDLc, and triglycerides negatively correlated with subjective PA parameters.In women, it seems more appropriate to use objective methods to measure PA, while in men, objective and subjective methods seem to be complementary.

Women with early menarche and nulliparity or low parity are also at a higher risk of experiencing premature or early menopause. Cigarette smoking (with a strong dose\u2013response effect) and being underweight have been consistently associated with premature and early menopause. Current guidelines for the management of premature and early menopause mainly focus on early initiation of hormone therapy (HT) and continued treatment until the woman reaches the average age at menopause (50\u201352 years). We suggest that clinicians and health professionals consider the age at menopause of the relevant region or ethnic group as part of the assessment for the timing of HT cessation. In addition, there should be early monitoring of women with a family history of early menopause, who are a child of a multiple pregnancy, or who have had early menarche (especially those who have had no children). As part of preventive health strategies, women should be encouraged to quit smoking (preferably before the age of 30 years) and maintain optimal weight in order to reduce their risk of premature or early menopause.",

     "abstract": "Older informal carers play a vital, growing role in supporting others with long-term health conditions but their support needs and experiences are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions of volunteers and professionals of the experiences and support needs of older carers (aged 70+ years).Thirty-five volunteers and professionals working with older carers in the voluntary and statutory sectors participated in a series of focus groups in outer London, United Kingdom. Groups were audio recorded, transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis.Five main themes were identified. These included participants\u2019 perceptions of older carers\u2019 ambivalence about asking for support, their multiple losses, often restricted lives, social isolation and loneliness and concerns for their loved ones when they can no longer care. Overall, these themes are similar to those reported for adult carers in general but older carers\u2019 experiences were regarded as more challenging primarily because of their pride, attitudes to caring and because of their age, their own health was often declining making the physical aspects of caring and leaving their homes more difficult. Concerns about the future are thought to be particularly important for older carers of adult children with disabilities because they expect to be outlived by their children, although similar concerns were voiced by spouses of partners living with dementia.Professionals and volunteers need to consider these additional challenges for older carers. Support with accessing services, for example from the voluntary sector, is important as is future exploration of how to support older carers in planning for the future care for their loved ones is needed.",

     "abstract": "Health care focuses on controlling symptoms and managing risk factors to improve survival by avoiding future complications. Diagnoses describe a group of signs and symptoms, often implying specific aetiologies and underlying pathophysiological disease processes. The diagnosis provides a tool for the health professional to conceptualise and classify a presentation, and thus manage the condition, and can provide the patient with an explanation or validation of their experience. Not every diagnosis holds significant clinical implications. There are diagnosed conditions that do not require treatment and, moreover, where treatment has the potential for harm without the potential for benefit. Promoting investigations and diagnoses can lead to overdiagnosis related to vested interests in increased services, use of devices or therapeutics. Multiple factors drive this issue, including broadening disease definitions and cultural factors that encourage tests and treatments, as well as medicolegal factors. While the traditional medicine review process typically involved cross-referencing medicines used with current diagnoses, a more sophisticated version of this process critically reviews the medicines and associated diagnosis, giving less emphasis to diagnoses that are no longer relevant. Known as undiagnosis, this process facilitates the withdrawal of corresponding medicines used to manage those conditions. Systematically reviewing diagnoses regularly and the associated medicine management strategies could reduce prescribing. The novel ERASE process can help clinicians Evaluate diagnoses to consider Resolved conditions, Ageing normally and Selecting appropriate targets to Eliminate unnecessary diagnoses and their corresponding medicines.",

However, approximately one-third of ischaemic strokes remain unexplained, or \u2018cryptogenic\u2019. There is a wide range of possible underlying causes in cryptogenic stroke, and the best approach to secondary prevention of these may differ. To date, though, the widely accepted and uniform secondary preventive strategy in this group consists of modification of vascular risk factors, and of treatment with a combination of antiplatelet therapy and antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication.Among the potential causes for cryptogenic stroke are occult atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale, atrial cardiopathy, aortic arch atheroma and hypercoagulable states. While it is possible to diagnose these conditions, in individual patients there is often uncertainty over whether they have a directly causative role, are markers of disease, or are innocent bystanders. Similarly, even if the cause is found, the best secondary preventive strategies remain uncertain, which questions the benefit of extensive investigations in a clinical setting. More recently, the concept of \u201cembolic stroke of unknown source (ESUS)\u201d has been introduced, in the hope that anticoagulation may offer better secondary prevention than antiplatelet therapy, but trials so far have been negative.At present, there is little justification for introducing extensive new investigative strategies into the management of patients with cryptogenic stroke. Investigations should be targeted at identifying those high-risk conditions which lead to a change in management. Further investigations need to be tailored individually, according to clinical circumstances. This should include identifying patients for participation in clinical trials, as the significance and best management of many of the potential causes for cryptogenic stroke require further research.",

     "abstract": "Bone and muscle are required for mobility but they also have endocrine and metabolic functions. In ageing as well as in many chronic diseases, bone loss and muscle atrophy occur simultaneously, leading to concomitant osteoporosis and sarcopenia. This occurs in both genders but compared with postmenopausal women, men appear to be better protected against age-related bone and muscle decay. Sex steroids (both androgens like testosterone and oestrogens like estradiol) are mainly responsible for musculoskeletal sexual dimorphism. They stimulate peak bone and muscle mass accretion during puberty and midlife, and prevent subsequent loss in ageing men but not post-menopausal women. Still, recent studies have highlighted the importance of intrinsic ageing mechanisms such as cellular senescence and oxidative stress in both genders. Sarcopenia may predispose to dysmobility, frailty, falls and fractures, but whether so-called osteosarcopenia qualifies as a distinct entity remains debated. Although randomized clinical trials in male osteoporosis are smaller and therefore underpowered for some outcomes like hip fractures, the available evidence suggests that the clinical diagnostic and therapeutic approach to male osteoporosis is largely similar to that in postmenopausal women. There is a clear unmet medical need for effective and safe anabolic drugs to rebuild the ageing skeleton, muscle, and preferably both tissues simultaneously. The Wnt/sclerostin and myostatin/activin receptor signalling pathways appear particularly promising in this regard. In this narrative review, we aim to provide an overview of our current understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of male osteoporosis and sarcopenia, and interactions between these two diseases.",

     "abstract": "Background: The 6-item Brief Geriatric Assessment (BGA) provides a priori risk stratification of incident hospital health adverse events, but it has not been used yet to assess the risk of unplanned hospital admission for older patients in primary care. This study aims to examine the association between the a priori risk stratification levels of the 6-item BGA performed by general practitioners (GPs) and incident unplanned hospital admissions in older community patients.Methods: Based on an observational prospective cohort design, 668 participants (mean age 84.7\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9 years; 64.7% female) were recruited by their GPs during an index primary care visit. The 6-item BGA was completed at baseline and provided an a priori risk stratification in three levels (low, moderate, high). Incident unplanned hospital admissions were recorded during a 6-month follow-up.Results: The incidence of unplanned hospital admissions increased with the risk level of the 6-item BGA stratification, the highest prevalence (35.3%) being reported with the high-risk level (P\u2009=\u20090.001). The risk of unplanned hospital admission at the high-risk level was significant (crude odds ratio (OR)\u2009=\u20095.48, P\u2009=\u20090.001 and fully adjusted OR\u2009=\u20093.71, P\u2009=\u20090.032, crude hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20094.20; P\u2009=\u20090.002 and fully adjusted HR\u2009=\u20092.81; P\u2009=\u20090.035). The Kaplan-Meier\u2019s distributions of incident unplanned hospital admissions differed significantly between the three risk levels (P-value\u2009=\u20090.002). Participants with a high-risk level were more frequently admitted to hospital than those at a low-risk level (P\u2009=\u20090.001). Criteria performances of all risk levels were poor, except the specificity of the high-risk level, which was 98.2%.Conclusions: The a priori 6-item BGA risk stratification was significantly associated with incident unplanned hospital admissions in primary care older patients. However, except for the specificity of the high-risk level, its criteria performances were poor, suggesting that this tool is unsuitable for screening older patients in primary care settings at risk of unplanned hospital admission.",

In region-specific analyses, ANM was associated with grip strength in Albania and Latin America and with gait speed in Albania only. No associations were observed in Canada.ANM is associated with markers of physical functioning.

Understanding the effect of dietary phytochemical intake from foods on osteoarthritis and its long-term outcomes may inform public health strategies for osteoarthritis prevention and management, reducing healthcare costs globally. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effects of dietary phytochemical intake from foods on osteoarthritis in adult populations. A literature search was performed using Scopus, Web of Science, MEDLINE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library for human studies to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies focused on osteoarthritis up to May 2018. From 5879 articles, five RCTs and four cross-sectional studies were identified. Dietary carotenoids were examined in the observational studies, while dietary intakes of polyphenols from foods were assessed in the RCTs. Dietary polyphenol intake from foods (e.g., freeze-dried strawberries and tart cherry juice) may slow the progression of osteoarthritis via decreased inflammation and reduced cartilage degradation. However, there were relatively few studies and a lack of uniformity in the biomarkers used and the measurements of pain, quality of life and physical activity relating to osteoarthritis. The heterogeneity among the studies suggests that there is insufficient evidence related to phytochemical intake from foods. High-quality epidemiological studies and controlled trials are therefore required. Nevertheless, exploring dietary phytochemical intake from foods may complement current dietary strategies for the management of osteoarthritis and help in the formulation of more economical and manageable strategies for osteoarthritis.",

METH has the capacity to modulate immune cells, giving the drug long-term effects which may manifest as neuropsychiatric disorders, and that increase susceptibility to communicable diseases, such as HIV. In addition, changes to the cytokine balance have been associated with compromise of the blood\u2013brain barrier, resulting to alterations to brain plasticity, creating lasting neurotoxicity.

It has serious physical and psychological health consequences as well huge economic and social costs. With an ageing population globally, it is important to understand how older women experience IPV. We present a narrative review of 48 studies exploring IPV in women aged \u226545 years, focusing on: (1) prevalence of IPV; (2) factors associated with IPV; (3) impact of IPV; (4) responses to IPV; (5) IPV interventions; and (6) key populations. Although we found significant gaps in the literature and an inconsistency in definitions, data suggest that IPV is commonly experienced by older women (lifetime prevalence 16.5%\u201354.5%), but that their age and life transitions mean that they may experience abuse differently to younger women. They also face unique barriers to accessing help, such as disability and dependence on their partners. We recommend commissioning services that are specifically tailored to meet their needs. Professionals working in frontline services where older women are commonly seen should be trained to identify and respond to IPV appropriately.",

     "abstract": "Merely viewing objects within reachable space can activate motor cortical networks and potentiate movement. This holds potential value for smooth interaction with objects in our surroundings, and could offer an advantage for quickly generating targeted hand movements (e.g. grasping a support rail to maintain stability). The present study investigated if viewing a wall-mounted safety handle resulted in automatic activation of motor cortical networks, and if this effect changes with age. Twenty-five young adults (18\u201330 years) and seventeen older adults (65+ years) were included in this study. Single-pulse, transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the motor cortical hand representation of young and older adults shortly after they viewed a safety handle within reaching distance. Between trials, vision was occluded and the environment was unpredictably altered to reveal either a safety handle, or no handle (i.e. covered). Modulation of intrinsic hand muscle activity was evident in young adults when viewing a handle, and this was selective in terms of both the muscles activated and the time at which it emerged. By contrast, older adults failed to show any changes when viewing the safety handle. Specifically, the presence of a handle increased corticospinal activity in hand muscles of young adults when TMS was applied 120\u2009ms after opening the goggles (p\u2009=\u2009.014), but not in the older adults (p\u2009>\u2009.954). The fact that the visual priming observed in younger adults was absent in older adults suggests that aging may diminish the ability to quickly put our visual world into automatic motor terms.",

We examined the associations of urinary isoflavone levels as well as soy food intake with estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) in pre- and postmenopausal women. In addition, we compared the levels of isoflavones, E1 and E2 across current hormone users such as those receiving hormone replacement therapy and those using oral contraceptives and non-users among both pre- and postmenopausal women. Urinary levels of isoflavones, E1 and E2 in 498 women (36 hormone users and 462 non-users) were analyzed. Premenopausal women with a higher frequency of soy food intake had higher urinary isoflavone levels, but there were no significant associations between E1 and E2 levels and urinary isoflavone levels. Levels of E1 and E2 in hormone users were significantly lower than those in hormone non-users among premenopausal women, but levels of E1 and E2 in hormone users were significantly higher than those in hormone non-users among postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women with a higher frequency of soy food intake had higher urinary isoflavone levels, and postmenopausal women with high urinary isoflavone levels had significantly higher E1 and E2 levels. In conclusion, the associations of urinary isoflavone levels with urinary estrogen levels differed with menopausal status. Urinary levels of E1 and E2 were high in postmenopausal women with high urinary isoflavone levels but not in premenopausal women with high urinary isoflavone levels.",

Patients with clinical conditions that could affect balance (e.g. Meniere\u2019s disease), denosumab users, and those with advanced kidney failure were excluded.We assessed dynamic balance by timed \u201cup and go\u201d (TUG)and four-square step tests, and by gait parameters; and static balance by posturography on a force platform. Blood tests provided values of PTH, vitamin D, calcium, albumin, and creatinine. Standard questionnaires were applied to assess clinical condition, medications and nutritional status, and to screen for depression.For dynamic balance, elevated PTH concentrations resulted in increased time to complete the TUG test (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.13; 95%CI: 0.01\u20130.26), indicating worse performance. For static balance, increased PTH was associated with increased instability in the center of pressure while standing with eyes closed on a hard surface (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.38; 95%CI: 0.03\u20130.73). Both models were controlled for vitamin D, renal function, nutritional and depressive status, age, sex, and number of medications.Increasing concentrations of PTH in this population of older persons had an independent negative association with both static and dynamic balance, which could place them at risk of falls.

Hormone therapy (HT) has beneficial effects on chronic diseases as well as on menopause symptoms. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of HT use with MetS and its components by diabetes status in middle-aged postmenopausal Korean women. A cross-sectional analysis was undertaken of a total of 39,295 non-diabetic and 3,359 diabetic postmenopausal women aged 40 to 69 years from the Health Examinees-Gem (HEXA-G) study (2004\u20132013). The mean differences in the MetS components by HT use were assessed using a general linear model and Tukey\u2019s multiple comparisons tests. The prevalence odds ratio (POR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the logistic regression model. HT use was associated with lower fasting glucose level, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio among both diabetic and non-diabetic women. In non-diabetic women, HT \u2018ever\u2019 use was negatively associated with the prevalence of MetS (POR\u2009=\u20090.80, 95% CI: 0.75-0.85), and current users had a lower prevalence of MetS (POR\u2009=\u20090.68, 95% CI: 0.60-0.76). A longer duration of HT use was associated with a decreasing prevalence of MetS. We did not find heterogeneity by age regarding MetS prevalence. Our results suggest that HT use is negatively associated with the prevalence of MetS among postmenopausal women.

The prevalence of disabling hearing loss among the elderly worldwide is 33% and in Italy ranges from 0.6% (profound hearing loss) to 39% (mild hearing loss). We investigated the relationship between self-reported hearing disability and clinician-evaluated hearing status, and its longitudinal consequences in relation to cognitive impairment and functional decline. We hypothesised that subjects who report that they have a hearing disability have a worse functional and cognitive profile than people who do not report having a hearing disability.We analysed 1171 participants in the InveCe.Ab study, a longitudinal population-based study. We evaluated whether self-reported hearing disability was consistent with clinician-evaluated hearing status (using the Whispered Voice Test; WVT), categorizing this variable as: unaware of hearing loss (UHL), aware of hearing loss (AHL), only subjective hearing loss (OSHL), without hearing loss (noHL). We also examined its relationship with various population characteristics, and its long-term effects on functional and cognitive performance and depressive symptoms.At baseline, hearing loss was found in 13.6% (95% CI: 11.7\u201315.7) of the participants [17.6% (95% CI: 12.0\u201324.4) AHL; 82.4% (95% CI: 75.6\u201388) UHL], while 2.3% (95% CI: 1.4\u20133.4) of the subjects with normal WVT hearing status had OSHL. Male gender, age, functional and cognitive performance, and depressive symptoms were associated with consistency between self-reported hearing disability and WVT hearing status. Longitudinal analysis revealed worsening functional performance and selective attention, global cognitive deterioration, and depressive symptoms in the AHL group.Our results showed that awareness of hearing disability in the elderly has adverse cognitive and functional consequences over time. When clinicians inform those who are unaware of their hearing problems, they should arrange for prompt referral not only for audiometric evaluation but also for counselling in order to prevent a negative impact of awareness of hearing loss.",

A dedicated theory explaining behaviour change in relation to physical activity in people with dementia does not exist. We aimed to develop a theoretical model which can be used to inform effective interventions to promote physical activity in people with dementia.There were five phases: 1. A search of the literature to identify theories which have been used to explain behaviour change in relation to physical activity in adult populations without a diagnosis of dementia; 2. Description of the theories (and sub-theories) and their main constructs; 3. Synthesis of the constructs; 4. Adaptation of the constructs to dementia; 5. Development and explanation of a model for physical activity in people with dementia (the \u2018PHYT in dementia\u2019).We identified nine theories used to explain behaviour change in relation to physical activity in adult populations without a diagnosis of dementia. Through our synthesis, we identified nine umbrella constructs. We integrated three more dementia-relevant constructs and developed the \u2018PHYT in dementia\u2019. The model was explained by providing a practical example of its application.Based on a scoping review of behaviour change theories in adults without dementia and following adaptation of the constructs from these theories to dementia, we derived a new theoretical model, the \u2018PHYT in dementia\u2019, which includes both individual-level and environment-level constructs. The model needs to be tested empirically, which our research team will do in the process evaluation of the Promoting Activity, Independence and Stability in Early Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment (PrAISED 2) study.

     "abstract": "New anti-osteoporotic agents have been developed, potentially enriching the therapeutic armamentarium. Currently available osteoanabolic therapies are the parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP) synthetic analogues, teriparatide and abaloparatide. Daily administration at doses of 20 and 80\u2009\u03bcg, respectively, in contrast to continuous PTH secretion, leads to increased bone formation and reduces vertebral and non-vertebral fracture risk. Teriparatide is more effective than bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate) in increasing bone mineral density (BMD), improving bone architecture and reducing fracture risk. Abaloparatide leads to greater BMD gain, has greater anti-fracture efficacy regarding major osteoporotic fractures (upper arm, wrist, hip or clinical spine) compared with teriparatide (without a difference in morphometric vertebral and non-vertebral fractures), and has a lower risk of hypercalcaemia. Romosozumab, a sclerostin inhibitor, both induces bone formation and suppresses bone resorption. Administered at monthly subcutaneous doses of 210\u2009mg, it reduces vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fracture risk compared with either placebo or alendronate. However, concerns have arisen about increased cardiovascular risk, which has suspended its approval by the FDA. Anabolic therapy should always be followed by administration of an anti-resorptive agent, such as bisphosphonates or denosumab, which preserves and may further increase BMD gain. Denosumab provides the greatest benefit for BMD when administered sequentially after its combination with teriparatide for 24 months and constitutes a reasonable option for patients at high risk of fracture. However, longitudinal data are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of these therapeutic interventions.",

     "abstract": "Objective Early surgical menopause (\u226445 years) can have significant short- and long-term health consequences. Hormone therapy (HT) is recommended for women with no contraindications. However, HT is greatly underutilized among these women due to their fear of the associated risks. The objective of this study is to identify and describe determinants of HT uptake and decision-making in women after surgical menopause.Methods We searched Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL, from inception to April 2018, to identify relevant literature. Inclusion criteria included studies that assessed factors affecting the uptake of HT and decision-making about HT after surgical menopause. Studies including both women with natural and surgical menopause were included. Search terms were derived from 3 main concepts: surgical menopause, hormone therapy, and decision-making. Papers included in the review had to be in the English language and to report human studies.Results Of the 1952 articles identified, 23 were eligible for inclusion. Studies were mostly published before the WHI (61%) and had a quantitative cross-sectional study design. Only 22% focused on surgical menopause per se. The mean age at time of surgical menopause was 43.6 years (range 29\u201368). HT uptake was associated with younger age, higher level of education, higher income and adopting positive lifestyle behaviors. Factors affecting decision-making were mostly perceptions, beliefs, and values women associate with HT, as well as knowledge of and experiences with HT and surgical menopause. External factors related to physicians\u2019 recommendations and information sources also influenced HT decision-making.Conclusion Our review highlights the complex nature of decision-making about HT after surgical menopause and the numerous factors involved. Women tend to rely on subjective perceptions and inferences from information sources, which may hamper the ability to make informed treatment decisions. There is a need for tailored decision-aid interventions to help support women and guide informed treatment decisions.",

Our first aim was to evaluate differences presented by elderly patients regarding symptoms, clinical features, color code (i.e. priority assigned to the case, where red is highest and yellow is medium), waiting time and outcome.We analyzed data from 201,580 patients aged >65, divided into two groups: 65\u201384 years and >85 years.Clinical and demographic data were collected from the computerized clinical record (GIPSE\u00ae).201,580 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of whom 93,262 (46.3%) were male. There were 162,373 patients aged 65\u201384, and 39,207 aged >85.Patients aged >85 presented more complex cases, and were admitted more frequently with a red color code and were more frequently hospitalized. Larger proportions of this group had dementia, and attended the ED for trauma or gastrointestinal bleeding. The group aged 65\u201384 were admitted more frequently with a yellow color code and then discharged. They typically attended the ED for chest and abdominal pain.There is an increase in the request for health care especially in an emergency setting. The hospitalization of elderly patients is associated with a deterioration in motor skills and quality of life.Being able to reduce hospitalization in the elderly means avoiding disruption to the home care of people with dementia, and reducing both the risk of falls and hospital infections. In Italy, a program (as already experimented with in the USA) dedicated to the elderly who attend hospital EDs is desirable.",

Additional exploratory univariate linear regression analyses were performed to assess the associations of change in WAI score with change in the different GCS domains and with type of treatment.Twenty-seven out of 31 women reported improvement in work ability at follow-up (T1) (M\u2009=\u200930.73, SD\u2009=\u20096.42 respectively, M\u2009=\u200934.86, SD\u2009=\u20095.98). All women reported to be less bothered by their menopausal symptoms at T1 (M\u2009=\u200926.57, SD\u2009=\u20098.69 respectively, M\u2009=\u200914.73, SD\u2009=\u20096.36). Multivariate linear regression demonstrated a significant association between the WAI and GCS change scores after correction for confounders (beta \u0394GCS\u2009=\u20090.283, p\u2009=\u20090.014). After additional adjustment for WAI at baseline, this association was no longer significant (beta \u0394GCS\u2009=\u20090.172, p\u2009=\u20090.164). Change in GCS depression domain (\u0394GCS depression) was significantly associated with \u0394WAI, although after correction for WAI at baseline the effect of \u0394GCS depression was no longer significant (beta\u2009=\u20090.855, p\u2009=\u20090.113). The WAI and GCS change scores were highly correlated, as a result their coefficients were not statistically significant separately.Treatment aimed at alleviating menopausal symptoms in symptomatic women could lead to improvement of menopausal symptoms along with improvement in work ability. Improvement of depressive symptoms seem particularly important for this outcome.",

     "abstract": "Objectives: Menopause involves hypoestrogenism, which is associated with numerous detrimental effects, including on respiratory health. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is often used to improve symptoms of menopause. The effects of HRT on lung function decline, hence lung ageing, have not yet been investigated despite the recognized effects of HRT on other health outcomes.Study design: The population-based multi-centre European Community Respiratory Health Survey provided complete data for 275 oral HRT users at two time points, who were matched with 383 nonusers and analysed with a two-level linear mixed effects regression model.Main outcome measures: We studied whether HRT use was associated with the annual decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1).Results: Lung function of women using oral HRT for more than five years declined less rapidly than that of nonusers. The adjusted difference in FVC decline was 5.6\u2009mL/y (95%CI: 1.8 to 9.3, p\u2009=\u20090.01) for women who had taken HRT for six to ten years and 8.9\u2009mL/y (3.5 to 14.2, p\u2009=\u20090.003) for those who had taken it for more than ten years. The adjusted difference in FEV1 decline was 4.4\u2009mL/y (0.9 to 8.0, p\u2009=\u20090.02) with treatment from six to ten years and 5.3\u2009mL/y (0.4 to 10.2, p\u2009=\u20090.048) with treatment for over ten years.Conclusions: In this longitudinal population-based study, the decline in lung function was less rapid in women who used HRT, following a dose-response pattern, and consistent when adjusting for potential confounding factors. This may signify that female sex hormones are of importance for lung ageing.",

The objectives of the study were: 1) to examine the association of sedentary time (ST) and physical fitness with \u201cIdeal Cardiovascular Health\u201d (ICH) in perimenopausal women, and 2) to determine the capacity of ST and physical fitness tests to discriminate between the presence or absence of ICH status in this population.Observational cross-sectional study.Sedentary time and different levels of physical activity were objectively assessed using triaxial accelerometry (on 7 consecutive days). Physical fitness was assessed with the Senior Fitness Test battery, handgrip strength, and sit-and-reach tests. ICH status was created from the cut-off values of several health behaviours (smoking, body mass index, physical activity, and diet) and classical cardiometabolic markers (plasma total cholesterol and fasting glucose, and blood pressure).A total of 122 perimenopausal women (52.6\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 years old) participated in this study. After adjusting for covariates, perimenopausal women with ICH status spent less time in sedentary behaviours and had higher scores on the 6-min-walk, 30-s-chair-stand, and back-scratch tests than women with a non-ICH status (all, P\u2264.03). Cut-off values of <460\u2009min/day in ST and \u2265\u22123\u2009cm on the back-scratch test were associated with around threefold higher odds (95% confidence interval 0.14-0.71 and 1.47\u20137.01, respectively, all P\u2009<.01) of having ICH status.Reduced ST and greater cardiorespiratory fitness, upper-body flexibility, and lower-body muscular strength were associated with a better cardiovascular profile in perimenopausal women. Including ST and upper-body flexibility as complementary ICH metrics might facilitate early identification of perimenopausal women with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease. However, further studies evaluating the usefulness of these potential complementary diagnostic tools in perimenopausal women are warranted before they are implemented in clinical practice.",

HR-pQCT was performed at the radius and tibia. TBS was determined using DXA.VF was observed in 42.6% of women and 28% of men. At the tibia, women with moderate/severe VF had lower volumetric bone density (vBMD), trabecular number (Tb.N), and SP, and higher trabecular separation (Tb.Sp); and men with VF had lower Tb.N and SP, and higher Tb.Sp. At the radius, women with moderate/severe VF had lower vBMD, trabecular and cortical thickness and SP; and men with VF had lower trabecular vBMD and SP. No associations between TBS and VF were observed in either gender.

Specifically, the economic burden of the illness is unclear. As a support for the public health policy makers and other health actors, our objective was to perform a systematic review of the literature comparing healthcare costs between sarcopenic and non-sarcopenic patients (under the registration number CRD42018099291). A search for relevant articles was conducted on the Medline and Scopus databases. Rigorous eligibility criteria were established (e.g., subjects with sarcopenia, both men and women, mean age of the sarcopenic population) and applied by two investigators to identify suitable studies. The first screening phase, performed by 2 independent reviewers, covered 455 references. Fourteen relevant studies were included in the final analysis. Overall, we noted an important heterogeneity between studies in the way of assessing sarcopenia (i.e. operational definitions, tools and cut-offs used). There were also large variations between studies in their cost analysis settings (i.e., discrepancies in time horizon, types and sources of economic data). Most of the studies focused on hospitalization costs following surgery for a specific disease such as cancer. Finally, 11 out of the 14 studies reported higher healthcare costs for sarcopenic patients. However, most of the included studies have important methodological bias (e.g. potential confusion factors rarely taken into account), and low to moderate quality scores. More standardized research, taking into account all the limitations of the published studies, should be conducted to assess the true impact of sarcopenia on healthcare consumption.",

     "abstract": "Hot flashes are believed to be related to hormonal changes. However, the relationship between hormonal fluctuations and hot flashes has not been studied. The objective of this study is to determine hormone measurement summaries that best explain the incidence of hot flashes in midlife women.In a cohort study of 798 midlife women over 1\u20137 years, women provided 4 weekly blood samples annually and completed a survey detailing life history, ongoing behaviors, and menopausal symptoms. Estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone were measured in all serum samples. Annual summary variables of each hormone were median, mean, maximum, minimum, variance, and range. The association of these values with hot flashes was assessed using multivariable logistic regression and Bayesian network analysis, controlling for smoking history and menopausal status. Main outcome measures: Hot flash incidence, severity, and frequency.For most outcomes, the best-fit model included progesterone variability; increased progesterone variance or range was correlated with decreased hot flash frequency (OR\u2009=\u20090.82, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.74\u20130.91) and severity (OR\u2009=\u20090.82, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.77-0.88). In the Bayesian network model, the maximum estradiol value was negatively correlated with many outcomes (OR for hot flashes\u2009=\u20090.68). Relationships between progesterone variability, maximum estradiol level, maximum progesterone level, and hot flashes indicate that the effects of progesterone variance on hot flash outcomes are likely mediated through progesterone\u2019s relationship with maximum estradiol level.Variability of progesterone, as opposed to mean values, should be used as an indicator of risk of hot flashes in midlife women.",

A medical diagnosis was not a criterion for exclusion from participation.Malnutrition risk (combined categories of \u201cat risk of malnutrition\u201d and \u201cmalnourished\u201d by the Mini-Nutritional Assessment tool) and food insecurity (assessed by the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale).Participants had a mean age of 72.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.5 years; 43.5% were male and 56.5% female. The prevalence of malnutrition was 5.3%, and 48.3% were \u201cat risk of malnutrition\u201d. The group of participants assessed as being at risk of malnutrition were significantly older, smoked, had a lower body mass index and a smaller waist circumference, reported single partnership status, and exhibited reduced appetite. Some degree of food insecurity was apparent in 69% of the participants. Food insecurity was associated with lack of higher education, reduced monthly income and low adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Additionally, food insecurity as compared with food security increased the risk of malnutrition (OR 2.63, 95% CI 1.21\u20135.75; p\u2009=\u20090.015) in the multivariate analysis.Given the financial difficulties experienced by the Greek older adult population over the last decade, a large proportion of them are at risk of malnutrition and experience some degree of food insecurity. With the two conditions being interrelated, early identification and management of both malnutrition and food insecurity are essential for public health and healthy ageing.",

Of the 725 women aged \u226550 years who completed the baseline survey, we excluded the 166 who already met this criterion. Of the remaining women, we analyzed data from the 446 who completed at least one of the follow-up surveys conducted 5 or 10 years after baseline. BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) and total hip (TH) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in the baseline survey. baPWV was measured both at baseline and at follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate the independent effect of BMD at baseline on developing the outcome during 10-year follow-up.We identified 166 women who newly developed increased arterial stiffness. The odds ratios (OR) for a 1 SD decrease in BMD at LS and TH for developing the outcome were 1.20 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91\u20131.50), and 1.44 (95% CI: 1.14\u20131.81), respectively, after adjusting for age and systolic blood pressure. After additionally adjusting for baPWV at baseline, the OR for a 1 SD decrease in BMD at TH remained significant (1.33, 95% CI: 1.02\u20131.72).Low BMD at TH was significantly associated with the development of increased arterial stiffness during a 10-year follow-up of Japanese women.",

The objectives of this study were to explore natural frailty transition rates at 1-year follow-up and to identify the main determinants of such transitions.Study design: Prospective longitudinal study covering a representative sample of community-dwelling older adults aged \u226565 years (n\u2009=\u2009749) at baseline, and transition information at 1-year follow-up (n\u2009=\u2009537).Mean outcome measures: The assessment of frailty status was based on phenotypic criteria (unintentional weight loss, weakness, exhaustion, slow walking speed, low physical activity). Frailty transitions (progressed, regressed, no change, or death) and associated factors were assessed.Results: Most participants remained unchanged from their baseline status (57.1% non-frail, 83.4% pre-frail, 66.7% frail). Regarding frailty transitions, 42.9% of non-frail older adults at baseline had progressed to a pre-frail status by the 1-year follow-up, and 7.9% of pre-frail older adults had become frail. Importantly, 33.3% of frail older adults regressed to a pre-frail status and 8.7% of pre-frail adults had regressed to a non-frail status. Non-frail females tended to progress to pre-frailty significantly more than males (p\u2009=\u20090.006), and mortality was higher among participants classified as frail at baseline (10.7%). Logistic regression showed that the main determinants of worsening frailty were hearing impairment (OR 3.180; 95% CI 1.078\u20139.384), congestive heart failure (OR 10.864; 95% CI 1.379\u201385.614), and polypharmacy (OR 2.572, 95% CI 1.096\u20136.037).Conclusion: Our results confirm the dynamic of frailty and the bidirectional nature of frailty transitions, and indicate the need for preventing and treating these conditions in later life in order to minimize the burden of frailty.",

The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether foot problems increase the risk of falling in community-dwelling older people.Electronic databases were searched from inception to May 2018. To be eligible for inclusion, papers needed to (i) include community-dwelling older participants, (ii) document falls either retrospectively or prospectively, and (iii) document or assess the presence of foot problems. Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent assessors, with disagreements resolved by consensus.A total of 146 papers were screened by title and abstract, and nine met the inclusion criteria. An additional six eligible papers were identified by searching the reference lists of included papers, resulting in a total of 15 papers. Quantitative synthesis indicated that older people who fell were more likely to have foot pain, hallux valgus, lesser toe deformity, plantar fasciitis, reduced ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, reduced toe plantarflexion strength, impaired tactile sensitivity and increased plantar pressures when walking. Meta-analysis indicated that fallers were more likely to have foot pain (pooled odds ratio [OR] 1.95, 95% CI 1.38\u20132.76, p\u2009<\u20090.001), hallux valgus (pooled OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.19\u20133.00, p\u2009=\u20090.007) and lesser toe deformity (pooled OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.07\u20132.59, p\u2009=\u20090.020).Foot problems, particularly foot pain, hallux valgus and lesser toe deformity, are associated with falls in older people. Documentation of foot problems and referral to foot care specialists should therefore be a routine component of falls risk assessment and prevention.",

Eligible systematic reviews were subjected to evidence mapping and the randomized controlled trials included in the systematic reviews were hand-searched for a network meta-analysis. Six systematic reviews were included in the evidence mapping. Acupuncture was the most common treatment modality studied (four randomized controlled trials), and pharmacological interventions, aerobic exercise, Nordic walking, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamin D were assessed less frequently. In view of the limitations in the overall confidence level for each review, the evidence for acupuncture as an effective treatment for AIA was considered low. Second, data from 6 randomized controlled trials were included in the network meta-analysis. When compared with a waiting list control, acupuncture (mean difference [MD] -2.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.16, -0.84), aerobic exercise (MD -0.80, 95% CI -1.33, -0.016), and omega-3 fatty acids (MD -2.10, 95% CI -3.23, -0.97) significantly improved pain severity scores. Network meta-analysis of adverse events was not possible because of poor reporting. Acupuncture is presently the most widely investigated intervention but is recommended for AIA with low overall confidence based on the current evidence.",

Physicians need up-to-date medical knowledge (i.e., indications, dose and safety properties) before prescribing cannabis for older patients, who are, a priori, more prone to its adverse effects than younger patients. A mini-review was conducted to examine the evidence on medical cannabis use in older patients.Methods: An English and French systematic Medline (PubMed) search, from January 1, 2001 to October 15, 2018, was conducted using the MeSH terms \"Cannabis\"[Mesh] OR \"Marijuana Abuse\"[Mesh] OR \"Medical Marijuana\"[Mesh] OR \"Marijuana Smoking\"[Mesh] combined with the MeSH terms (\"Aged\"[Mesh]) OR \"Aged, 80 and over\"[Mesh]. A total of 451 abstracts were identified and full relevant articles were retrieved and analysed.Results: Even with a growing body of data showing positive effects of medical cannabis use, mixed results have been reported. Most clinical studies have had small samples and there are few randomized controlled trials. This lack of evidence on the positive clinical effects of medical cannabis use is especially marked for older patients, few of whom have been examined.Conclusions: There is a lack of consistent data on the clinical effects of medical cannabis use in older patients to guide cannabis prescription for this group of patients.",

Hyperuricaemia is a prerequisite and a fifth of both men and woman are hyperuricaemic. The prevalence of gout is much lower than the prevalence of hyperuricaemia for reasons that are not currently clear. Gout is more common in men than women prior to menopause due to the uricosuric effects of oestrogen, but after menopause the incidence of gout rises substantially in women. Co-morbidities are an important issue in gout, with cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity and chronic kidney disease all common in patients with gout. Environmental factors like diet affect the incidence of gout but there is little evidence to support an emphasis on diet in treating established gout. The diagnosis of gout is often made without the use of joint aspiration and validated diagnostic rules are available for both primary and secondary care as well as classification criteria for research use. The overarching principle of the management of gout with pharmacotherapy is the need to reduce serum urate levels to below a target of 0.30\u2009mmol/L or 0.36\u2009mmol/L depending on whether it is tophaceous or non-tophaceous respectively. The use of allopurinol has been researched extensively and newer strategies for safer effective dosing are now recommended. Newer agents have been introduced for the treatment of gout, including febuxostat and lesinurad. A number of important questions in the field are under current investigation.",

The present study examines the extent of self-reported driving anxiety in older adult drivers.Population survey of community-dwelling older drivers.New Zealand.1170 adults aged 65 and over.Self-reported ratings of driving anxiety.62.3% of participants reported no driving anxiety, 27.0% reported mild driving anxiety and 10.7% endorsed more moderate to extreme levels of driving anxiety, which is higher than has been identified with adults aged 55\u201372. Women were significantly more often (p\u2009<\u2009 .01) represented in the groups of mildly and moderately anxious drivers, and those who were moderately to extremely anxious were more likely to be aged 70+ (p\u2009<\u2009 .04). Those with moderate to severe driving anxiety tended to drive less often, for shorter distances, and to use alternative modes of transport more often than those with mild or no driving anxiety.Driving anxiety is experienced by many older adults, with quite a large proportion reporting high levels of driving anxiety and associated differences in driving patterns. Further research is needed to better understand why older drivers experience driving anxiety, and how it impacts health and wellbeing as well as driving self-regulation and cessation.",

We used case-control analyses to investigate several characteristics associated with bilateral oophorectomy. Odds ratios and their 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for race, education, and income.In the overall analyses, infertility was more common in women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy than in the controls, whereas use of oral contraceptives, a history of breast feeding, and fibrocystic breast disease were less common. The women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy weighed more than controls, had a higher body mass index and were younger at menarche. The associations were more pronounced for women who underwent the bilateral oophorectomy before age 46 years, and some associations were different for women with or without a benign ovarian indication. Reported family histories of uterine and other cancers were more common in women without a benign ovarian indication.We identified a number of personal, reproductive, and familial characteristics that were associated with bilateral oophorectomy over a 20-year period.

Controversy also exists about the benefits and risks of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in women with T2DM.To summarise the evidence on 1) the effect of menopause on metabolic parameters and the risk of T2DM, 2) the effect of T2DM on age at menopause, 3) the effect of MHT on the risk of T2DM, and 4) the management of postmenopausal women with T2DM.Literature review and consensus of experts\u2019 opinions.Metabolic changes during the menopausal transition include an increase in and the central redistribution of adipose tissue, as well as a decrease in energy expenditure. In addition, there is impairment of insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity and an increase in the risk of T2DM. MHT has a favourable effect on glucose metabolism, both in women with and in women without T2DM, while it may delay the onset of T2DM. MHT in women with T2DM should be administered according to their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In women with T2DM and low CVD risk, oral oestrogens may be preferred, while transdermal 17\u03b2-oestradiol is preferred for women with T2DM and coexistent CVD risk factors, such as obesity. In any case, a progestogen with neutral effects on glucose metabolism should be used, such as progesterone, dydrogesterone or transdermal norethisterone. Postmenopausal women with T2DM should be managed primarily with lifestyle intervention, including diet and exercise. Most of them will eventually require pharmacological therapy. The selection of antidiabetic medications should be based on the patient\u2019s specific characteristics and comorbidities, as well on the metabolic, cardiovascular and bone effects of the medications.",

Polarized light therapy (PLT) utilizes visible-spectrum polarized light for a number of clinical applications. The advantage of polarized light is that it is able to penetrate the skin to a depth of up to 5\u2009cm, reaching deeper tissues involved in wound healing. PLT has been shown to accelerate the healing process for ulcers, surgical wounds and dermal burns as well as a small number of musculoskeletal injuries. As research into the histological and physiological effects of PLT is largely absent, studies related to other light therapy modalities, largely low-level laser therapy, may pave the way to identify putative mechanisms by which PLT might exert its effects. Changes to cell signalling and secretion of substances required for wound healing have been identified in response to phototherapies. The reviewed literature suggests that PLT may be efficacious in some wound and injury healing contexts, though a gap in the literature exists regarding its mechanisms of action. Future studies should fully explain the therapeutic effects of PLT and the physiological mechanisms underpinning them.",

We found 48 relevant publications, out of which 14 papers were original research, all related to the development and licensing of intravaginal DHEA. We critically analysed these 14 articles in relation to sexual function.All the randomised controlled trials assessed the efficacy of vaginal DHEA in women with vulvovaginal atrophy and showed that sexual dysfunction improved with treatment regardless of the level of dyspareunia at baseline. Treatment with DHEA was found to be superior to placebo and at least as efficacious as vaginal oestrogens in improving symptoms.Intravaginal DHEA appears to be a safe and effective treatment for menopausal vulvovaginal atrophy and dyspareunia in most women. Further studies are required before it can be recommended for women with a history of thrombosis, cardiovascular disease or hormone-sensitive neoplasms.",

     "abstract": "Nocturia, defined as waking at night to pass urine, is a common condition which increases with age. Whilst nocturia is known to have an important effect on quality of life, more recent evidence has linked the symptom with significant morbidity and mortality due to the effects of sleep deprivation on glucose metabolism and the immune system. The causes of nocturia are multifactorial and may be related to urine overproduction, storage disorders and primary sleep disorders. The commonest underlying pathology, however, is nocturnal polyuria, which may be associated with a number of medical conditions. This review explores the underlying causes of nocturia and nocturnal polyuria and, by doing so, describes a multidisciplinary approach to managing patients effectively.",

The diagnostic performance of the four indices was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.NAFLD by ultrasonography was detected in 132 of the total sample of 290 women (45.5%). VAI, FLI, LAP and HSI values were significantly higher in women with NAFLD than those without. The areas under the curve (AUROCs) for VAI, FLI, LAP and HSI were 0.77\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03, 0.87\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02, 0.84\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02 and 0.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.02, respectively, in the whole group, showing an adequate discriminatory ability for NAFLD of the four indices. AUROCs of the four indices calculated separately for PCOS and control women showed a similar performance of all indices in the two groups.These data show that VAI is useful for detecting NAFLD in premenopausal women with and without PCOS. However, VAI had a lower diagnostic performance in this cohort than FLI, LAP and HSI.",

The prevalence and the factors associated with each form of UI were explored using multivariable weighted logistic regression.59.3% of the women were premenopausal, 8.4% perimenopausal and 32.3% postmenopausal. 83.2% had a BMI\u2009<\u200928\u2009kg/m2 and none were using menopausal hormone therapy. The prevalence of stress UI was 5.4% (95% CI 4.4\u20136.6%), urgency UI 11.3% (9.8\u201312.9%), and mixed UI 7.0% (5.8\u20138.3%). Urgency UI was the most prevalent form of UI at each decade of age. Postmenopausal women were significantly more likely to have urgency UI (AOR 2.41, 95%CI 1.38\u20134.20; p\u2009=\u20090.002) and mixed UI (AOR 2.35, 95%CI 1.22\u20134.50; p\u2009=\u20090.010).

Being postmenopausal, having more than two children, being obese and working outside the home increase the likelihood of urgency UI, whereas higher socio-economic status and lower weight appear to be protective. Menopausal hormone therapy use was not reported by any study participants.",

In contrast, we observed a lower relative abundance of the Prevotella, Parabacteroides and Bilophila genera, and IL-6 and MCP-1 plasma levels in pre-menopausal women than in post-menopausal women, who had similar levels to the men. We also found higher GiP and leptin plasma levels in women than in men, irrespective of the menopausal status of the women. In addition, adiponectin levels were higher in pre-menopausal women than in their corresponding age-matched male control group.Our results suggest that the differences in the composition of gut microbiota between genders and between women of different hormonal status may be related to the sexual dimorphism observed in the incidence of metabolic diseases and their co-morbidities.",

The first part consists of cross-sectional evaluation of 750 postmenopausal women recruited consecutively from the Menopause Unit of an academic hospital. Dietary intake will be assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Nutrient and food group intake will be calculated and adherence to the Mediterranean diet and other dietary patterns will be evaluated.

Most of the programs can improve psychological health-related quality of life. Depressive and anxious symptoms seem to be associated with some stressors, such as the perception of breast cancer, prognosis, long-term treatment-related side-effects and fear of cancer recurrence. Beyond physical fitness, several physical activity programs for breast cancer survivors have been reported to improve psychosocial wellness and life satisfaction. However, many physical activity programs have failed to motivate breast cancer survivors due to barriers such as general health issues and lack of time. More specifically, women may have little confidence in the benefits of physical activity and breast cancer outcomes. Therefore, engaging breast cancer survivors in physical activity is challenging for health care professionals. Herein, we identify cancer-related mental distress, coping style and behavioral theories applied to physical activity programs in breast cancer survivors. More specifically, we discuss the effectiveness and limitations of 3 psychological theories and 2 concepts related to behavioral change, including the theory of planned behavior, social cognitive theory, self-determination theory, transtheoretical model and motivational interviewing for physical activity adherence in breast cancer survivors.",

Fewer than half (48%) indicated that they had engaged in any kind of learning action regarding menopause.

However, in this study the interpersonal level was the only level whose factors provided respondents with more help than hindrance. At all other levels, women were hindered from gaining the knowledge they need. From feelings of embarrassment to feelings of neglect by health care providers, women struggled to gain the information they sought.Understanding that education is one of the key determinants of health, the most important implication of the results of this study is that there is a need to connect adult education with health promotion, at every level of the socio-ecological model of health promotion.",

Overall trends in 'high' total sitting time (>8\u2009h/day sitting) and five domains were examined: a) >5\u2009h/day for TV; b) >2\u2009h/day for travel; c) >2\u2009h/day for home computer use; d) >2\u2009h/day for leisure; and e) >6\u2009h/day for work. Sitting to watch TV and sitting at work accounted for more than half of total sitting time. The proportions who reported high sitting for computer use at home increased from 25% in 2007 to 37% in 2013 in men and from 19% to 29% over the same period in women. High TV sitting time was reported by 11.8% of men and 10.2% of women. These estimates increased to 16.5% and 13.2% respectively over the six years. In conclusion, although overall total sitting time remained fairly stable, there were significant increases in sitting time in some domains (home computer use and TV viewing) and in some sub-groups (such as women, and the employed). These increases were countered by declines in work-related sitting due to retirement.",

We hypothesised that greater integration in social relationships across adulthood is associated with greater expectation of informal care, and that greater morbidity over a longer time period is associated with greater expectation of formal care.The MRC National Survey of Health and Development, a population-based birth cohort study set in mainland Britain, provided data on care expectations for 2135 participants aged 68\u201369. The outcome was who, besides the partner or spouse, is expected to provide for the future care needs, coded as adult children, other relatives, friends/neighbours, paid/professional care, or no one. Adult children were taken as the reference category and the latter two categories were combined as \u2018formal care\u2019 in the multiple regression analysis.91% had an adult child, of whom 74% expected them to provide care if needed, and 11% expected formal care. The latter rose to 33% of those with no adult children. Geographical distance to adult children (over 25 miles) was strongly correlated with expectations but, independently of this, lack of someone to help in a crisis from midlife onwards and low social contact were associated with expecting formal care. Expectations did not differ by number of chronic conditions, functional limitations or longstanding illness from age 60\u2009+\u2009.Those lacking social relationships in midlife onwards and those living further from adult children are more likely to expect formal help with their future care needs. As personal care needs are projected to rise with population ageing and families are increasingly expected to provide for these needs, initiatives to remove barriers to smaller distances between ageing parents and their children and to support and maintain high-quality family relationships across the life course should be considered.",

In the men, significant correlations were observed between Go/NoGo tasks and DB (r range: 0.373 to 0.653 for TUG, and -0.342 to -0.530 for FRT). In the younger women, Go/NoGo tasks were correlated with SB (r range: 0.323 to 0.572), and no correlations were observed in the older women. Go/NoGo tasks without distractions followed by tasks with audio distractors explained postural control measures.Posture-unrelated attention inhibition was associated with SB in the women and with DB in the men. Tasks with no distractions explained the variability in postural control in both genders. It is recommended to examine the effect of balance exercises on postural control and posture-unrelated attention control in both genders, and the contribution of the relationship between postural control and posture-unrelated attention control to falls in old age.",

The need to balance these demographic changes with gains in healthy life years and quality of life (QoL) constitutes an additional challenge. Aware of this, the European Commission (EC) launched the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing (EIPonAHA) in 2012. The EIPonAHA is an interdisciplinary and cross-sector initiative involving more than 3000 partners with two specific objectives: to increase the healthy life expectancy of Europeans by two years by 2020, while increasing their QoL. The initiatives of the EIPonAHA have been organized according to six thematic action groups (AGs), with the A3 group targeting areas relating to the prevention of functional decline and frailty. In addition to the good practices of partners, there are several on-going collaborative works. The involvement of the EC includes support through an elaborated research programme in which the Consumers, Health, Agriculture and Food Executive Agency (CHAFEA) and the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) are the main funding bodies. Screening approaches and preventive interventions constitute most of the initiatives within the A3 AG. Partners are distributed across five sub-groups according to good practices: i) cognitive decline, ii) food and nutrition, iii) physical activity, iv) caregivers, and v) frailty and functional decline. Regular updates of the progression of both good practices and collaborative works are presented in A3 AG meetings. The 2017 meeting in Valencia, Spain, showcased in this paper, provides an up-to-date overview of the current status of A3 activities.",

     "abstract": "Phytoestrogen-based medications are commonly used by menopausal women, and especially by obese postmenopausal women, to relieve menopausal symptoms. Substitution of animal with soy protein is often used in weight loss regimens, yet the effect of phytoestrogens, the main constituent of soy foods, on body composition is not completely understood. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the associations between phytoestrogen supplementation and body weight and the main parameters of body composition in postmenopausal women. A literature search was done using 5 electronic databases from inception to April 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with postmenopausal women comparing phytoestrogen supplementation followed by usual diet and placebo were included in the present meta-analysis. From 5932 references, we identified 23 RCTs that met our inclusion criteria, with a total of 1880 postmenopausal women. No association was observed between phytoestrogen supplementation and body weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumference, total fat mass or percentage of body fat. However, the use of phytoestrogens supplementation was associated with a slight decrease in waist-hip ratio; the pooled mean difference was \u22120.01\u202fcm (95%CI: \u22120.01 to \u22120.006). In subgroup analysis, we found a modest decrease in body weight with phytoestrogens supplementation compared with placebo in healthy postmenopausal women [pooled mean difference of changes \u22120.28\u202fkg (95%CI: \u22120.52 to \u22120.04)] and in RCTs with a median number of participants of 66 or less [pooled mean difference of changes \u22120.49\u202fkg (95%CI: \u22120.87 to \u22120.11)]. In contrast, phytoestrogen supplementation was associated with increased body weight in postmenopausal women with preexisting metabolic disorders (prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, prehypertension and hyperlipidemia) [pooled mean difference of changes: 0.78\u202fkg (95%CI: 0.53\u20131.03)]. In addition, there were some indications that some types of phytoestrogens, such as daidzein, but not soy products or isoflavone mix, could lead to modest adverse changes in body composition in menopausal women. Therefore, future studies should investigate the potential adverse effects of phytoestrogen supplementation on body composition among postmenopausal women.",

Probiotics may promote gut health, reduce allergenicity, increase the bio-accessibility of fats/proteins in foods, and lower blood pressure because they contain poly-amines and bioactive peptides. Bioactive peptides have been shown to lower the risk of hypertension and cancer. Herein, we discuss the potential role of fermented milk as a functional drink acting against hypertension. However, longer-term research studies are necessary to evaluate the role of fermented milk drinks in supporting human health.",

     "abstract": "Decreased gait velocity is associated with limited mobility, community participation, cognitive decline, and increased risk of falls in elderly women. Therefore, early detection of reduced gait velocity allows proper monitoring and treatment to prevent or delay the associated limitations. This study determined the age of major gait velocity decline in a large sample of women. The participants were 653 healthy women, aged 18\u201389 years, who were divided in five age groups: \u226426, 36\u201345, 46\u201360, 61\u201370 and \u226571\u202fyears. Their spatiotemporal gait parameters were collected using the GAITRite\u00ae computerized carpet. Two piecewise regression models \u2013 known and estimated breakpoint \u2013 with age as the independent variable and gait velocity as the dependent variable were used to determine the age of major gait velocity decline. ANOVAs were performed to identify differences in gait spatiotemporal variables between the five age groups with \u03b1\u202f=\u202f0.05. The estimated age of major gait velocity decline was 71\u202fyears. Age significantly predicted gait velocity (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001), explaining 23% of its variability. Gait velocity decline starts at 65 years and becomes more pronounced at 71\u202fyears. The estimated model showed that an increase of one year in age decreases gait velocity on average by 0.31\u202fcm/s. If age is>71\u202fyears, velocity will decrease on average by 1.75\u202fcm/s per year. The average velocity of women over the age of 71\u202fyears was 115.4\u202fcm/s, which as 7.8% less than a decade earlier. The five age groups demonstrated differences in gait velocity, step length, stance, swing, step, and double support time. This is the first study conducted in a large sample of women to have determined 71\u202fyears as the age of major gait decline. Identifying the age of gait velocity decline of healthy women could allow timely interventions to slow the general decline associated with lower gait velocities, such as falls, lower mobility, frailty, and death. Therefore, women near and above 71\u202fyears of age should be closely monitored due to the adverse health effects associated with reduced gait velocity.",

We studied cortisol metabolism in peri- and postmenopausal women with diverse climacteric-related symptoms.The study population was 35 women, aged 45\u201370 years. Plasma cortisol levels were measured from blood samples collected every 20\u202fmin over 24\u202fh. Urinary cortisol was analysed from 24-hour urine collections. Climacteric-related symptoms (vasomotor, sleep, depressive, anxiety, cognitive, sexual, menstrual, and somatic) were evaluated with the Women\u2019s Health Questionnaire (WHQ). Associations between cortisol variables (24-hour, night, day, maximum, minimum, morning baseline, cortisol awakening response (CAR), area under the curve, slope, and 24-hour urinary cortisol) and the symptoms were first examined with a correlation analysis. Then, the women were divided into two groups according to their climacteric symptomatology, and differences in cortisol variables between the groups were investigated. Diurnal cortisol curves by symptomatology were also analyzed visually.In the correlation analysis, more frequent vasomotor symptoms were associated with a higher CAR (rs\u202f=\u202f0.37, p\u202f=\u202f0.039) and lower 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion (rs= -0.45, p\u202f=\u202f0.012), and more frequent depressive symptoms were associated with a higher minimum cortisol level (rs\u202f=\u202f0.33, p\u202f=\u202f0.0498). When the women were divided into two groups, women with more frequent vasomotor (p\u202f=\u202f0.012) or somatic symptoms (p\u202f=\u202f0.021) had a lower 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion than less symptomatic women.Although previous studies have reported associations between climacteric-related symptoms and cortisol secretion, these two factors were not substantially interrelated in our study.",

Nationally representative samples of adults aged 50+ years from China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the Russian Federation and South Africa were analyzed (n\u202f=\u202f31,174).Educational level and wealth were used as socioeconomic indicators. Frailty was assessed with modified criteria for the frailty phenotype. Self-reported disease diagnoses were used. A relative index of inequality (RII) was calculated to compare socioeconomic inequalities in frailty between countries.People in lower socioeconomic positions had higher prevalence rates of frailty. The largest inequalities in frailty were found in Mexico (RII 3.7, 95% CI 2.1\u20136.4), and the smallest inequalities in Ghana (RII 1.1, 95% CI 0.7\u20131.8). Mediation analyses revealed that the chronic diseases considered in this study do not explain the higher prevalence of frailty seen in lower socioeconomic groups.Substantial socioeconomic inequalities in frailty were observed in LMICs, but additional research is needed to find explanations for these. Given that the population of older adults in many LMICs is expanding at a greater rate than in many high-income countries, our results indicate an urgent public health need to address frailty in these countries.",

At baseline, participants with no dementia who were \u201coften troubled by pain\u201d were considered to have pain. Pain severity was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. Cognitive function was explored through verbal fluency (assessed by asking how many different animals the participants could name in 60\u202fs), memory (sum of immediate and delayed verbal memory) and processing speed (number of target letters correctly identified on the letter cancellation task). Multivariable linear regression was used (exposure: pain; outcomes: cognitive change between follow-up and baseline, based on standardized residuals).

The prevalence of MS in postmenopausal women can be increased by the lack of protective effects of oestrogens. In the near future, because of the general increase in life expectancy, the number of postmenopausal women will rise substantially. Therefore, investigating both the environmental and the genetic factors predisposing to MS may have a great impact on women\u2019s health. The aim of this study was to determine whether particular oestrogen receptor (ESR) gene polymorphisms can predispose to the development of MS in women after menopause.The sample consisted of 147 postmenopausal women. In addition to collecting medical history and analyzing body composition using the TANITA scale, patient\u2019s waist size, blood pressure, serum lipids, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein and adiponectin were measured. The analysis of ESR gene polymorphisms was performed using the Sequenom MassARRAY platform.Three out of ten analyzed polymorphisms in the ESR1 gene (rs2234693, rs6902771, rs7774230) and one out of eight analyzed polymorphisms in the ESR2 gene (rs3020449) were associated with MS. The ESR1 rs2234693, rs6902771 and rs7774230 polymorphisms were associated with serum concentrations of high-density lipoproteins.

High-risk (Hazard ratio (HR)\u202f=\u202f1.68 with P\u202f<\u202f0.001) and moderate-risk (HR\u202f=\u202f1.24 with P\u202f=\u202f0.039) of a long hospital stay successfully predicted a long stay. Kaplan-Meier distributions of time to discharge showed that inpatients classified as having high and moderate risk levels for a long hospital stay were discharged later than those with a low risk level (P\u202f<\u202f0.001 and P\u202f=\u202f0.013).The 6-item BGA a priori levels of risk for a long hospital stay successfully predicted a long stay among patients admitted to a GAU in Quebec.",

Several studies have pointed out the important role of progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) in the development of BC, especially with hormone therapy using progestins. Although the deregulation of microRNA-181a (miR-181a) is often associated with human BC, the effect of miR-181a on PGRMC1 expression during hormone therapy has not been investigated.Cell viability assay and apoptosis assay were performed to investigate the pro-BC effect of progestin (norethisterone, NET) and anti-BC effect of miR-181a on MCF-7 cells. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analysis were used to evaluate gene expressions in the NET-treated MCF-7 cells.NET dose-dependently increased BC cell viability and this effect was accompanied by increased expression of PGRMC1. Overexpression of miR-181a strongly reduced the cell viability of MCF-7 cells, mainly through increased apoptosis, which was evidenced by substantially increased gene expression of pro-apoptosis factors such as BAX and CASPASE 9 in miR-181a overexpressed cells. Importantly, miR-181a abrogated NET-stimulated cell viability and PGRMC1 expression.We provide evidence that miR-181a promotes MCF-7 cell apoptosis. Moreover, miR-181a suppressed NET-provoked cell viability and PGRMC1 expression in MCF-7 cells. These data may suggest a therapeutic strategy of using miR-181a to reduce BC risk in progestin hormone replacement therapy.",

We analyzed the Fifth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES V, 2010\u20132011) to estimate the heritability of muscle mass in Korean parent-offspring pairs.Cross-sectional.A total of 1233 parents (average age 57.67\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.50 years) and 917 offspring (average age 29.10\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.57 years) from 743 families were included in the analysis. Muscle mass was estimated based on three different indices: appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) measured with a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), weight-adjusted ASM (SMI), and height-adjusted ASM (RASM). The heritability was estimated by employing the maximum-likelihood variance components implemented in Sequential Oligogenic Linkage Analysis Routines (SOLAR). The best-fitting model was determined out of four polygenic models. Pearson\u2019s partial correlation coefficient was also calculated using the muscle mass indices to further study the association between father or mother and son or daughter pairs.The heritability estimates of the muscle mass indices ranged from 55% to 80% (all p\u202f<\u202f0.01). The correlation coefficient of father and offspring ranged from 0.11 to 0.40, while that of mother and offspring ranged from 0.23 to 0.43 (all p\u202f<\u202f0.01).The heritability estimates of muscle mass in Koreans are large and significant, suggesting that parental muscle mass is an important predictor of the offspring\u2019s muscle mass. The result implies that there may be a genetic factor partly determining muscle mass.",

A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA standards. Independently, two authors searched the Cochrane, EMBASE & CINAHL databases, with subsequent independent extraction and semi-quantitative analysis. We report a considerable breadth in digital active ageing research, which is truly international in its scope. There is a diverse range of both interventions and technologies, including a reassuring focus on community-based interventions. Whilst there are a number of quantitative studies, sample sizes are small, with a limited amount of statistical testing of the results. There is significant variation in the outcome measures reported and little consensus as to the most effective intervention strategies. Overall, whilst there is considerable breadth to the research published in the literature, there is a clear restriction in the depth of this research. There is little overall consensus. This lack of depth and consensus may be due to the need to recognize the important role of technical research elements alongside more traditional research methodologies, such as randomized controlled trials. Enabling both technical and clinical research methods to be recognized, in tandem, has enormous potential to support individuals, communities, clinicians and policy makers to make more informed decisions in relation to active ageing.",

Although the burden of temperature-associated mortality may shift towards high temperatures in the future, cold temperatures may represent a greater current-day problem in temperate cities. Hot and cold temperature vulnerabilities may coincide across several personal and neighborhood characteristics, suggesting opportunities for increasing present and future resilience to extreme temperatures. We present a narrative literature review encompassing the epidemiology of cold- and heat-related mortality and morbidity, related physiologic and environmental mechanisms, and municipal responses to hot and cold weather, illustrated by Detroit, Michigan, USA, a financially burdened city in an economically diverse metropolitan area. The Detroit area experiences sharp increases in mortality and hospitalizations with extreme heat, while cold temperatures are associated with more gradual increases in mortality, with no clear threshold. Interventions such as heating and cooling centers may reduce but not eliminate temperature-associated health problems. Furthermore, direct hemodynamic responses to cold, sudden exertion, poor indoor air quality and respiratory epidemics likely contribute to cold-related mortality. Short- and long-term interventions to enhance energy and housing security and housing quality may reduce temperature-related health problems. Extreme temperatures can increase morbidity and mortality in municipalities like Detroit that experience both extreme heat and prolonged cold seasons amidst large socioeconomic disparities. The similarities in physiologic and built-environment vulnerabilities to both hot and cold weather suggest prioritization of strategies that address both present-day cold and near-future heat concerns.",

A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that age (odds ratio\u202f=\u202f1.06, 95% confidence interval\u202f=\u202f1.02\u20131.10), sarcopenia (1.98, 1.04\u20133.77), and limited contact with friends (1.82, 1.03\u20133.23) were independently associated with an increased risk of becoming homebound. In a stratified analysis for age group, a significant odds ratio for low level of social role (2.50, 1.06\u20135.91) was observed in young-old subjects (aged 65\u201374 years), whereas significant odds ratios for sarcopenia (2.80, 1.33\u20135.91) and physical inactivity (2.85, 1.28\u20136.37) were observed in old\u2013old subjects (aged 75 years and over).Sarcopenia had a strong impact on the risk of becoming homebound. Particularly in old\u2013old subjects, sarcopenia and physical inactivity may impair people\u2019s ability to engage in activities outside the home much more than either their mental status or their level of social participation.",

There is a growing body of literature that recognises the positive effects of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) on muscle strength, muscle mass and cardiorespiratory function in older adults. However, NMES suffers from poor clinical acceptability due to multiple barriers to its use, and poor patient engagement and adherence have been noted. Technology-based supports to exercise, such as biofeedback and \u2018gamification\u2019, have been effectively paired with a variety of rehabilitation interventions. This suggests that these supports could be promising additions to an NMES exercise system to reduce barriers to its use and maximise clinical outcomes.",

Objective assessment of daily physical activity (PA) is essential to accurately and reliably evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions. This review presents an overview of eHealth interventions that focus on promoting PA in community-dwelling older people, and discusses the methods used to objectively assess PA, and the effectiveness of the eHealth interventions in increasing PA. The twelve eHealth intervention studies that met our inclusion criteria used a variety of digital solutions, ranging from solely the use of an accelerometer or text messages, to interactive websites with access to (animated) coaches and peer support. Besides evaluating the effectiveness of an intervention on objectively assessed PA, all interventions also included continuous self-monitoring of PA as part of the intervention. Procedures for the collection and analysis of PA data varied across studies; five studies used pedometers to objectively assess PA and seven used tri-axial accelerometers. Main reported outcomes were daily step counts and minutes spent on PA. The current evidence seems to point to a positive short-term effect of increased PA (i.e. right after administering the intervention), but evidence for long-term effects is lacking. Many studies were underpowered to detect any intervention effects, and therefore larger studies with longer follow-up are needed to provide evidence on sustaining the PA increases that follow eHealth interventions in older people.",

However, there are increasing concerns relating to the security of healthcare data and devices. Increased connectivity to existing computer networks has exposed medical devices to new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Healthcare is an attractive target for cybercrime for two fundamental reasons: it is a rich source of valuable data and its defences are weak. Cybersecurity breaches include stealing health information and ransomware attacks on hospitals, and could include attacks on implanted medical devices. Breaches can reduce patient trust, cripple health systems and threaten human life. Ultimately, cybersecurity is critical to patient safety, yet has historically been lax. New legislation and regulations are in place to facilitate change. This requires cybersecurity to become an integral part of patient safety.

This review provides an overview of this developing area, and examines the disease-specific mechanisms underlying walking or balance deficits. Medline, PubMed, PsychInfo and Scopus databases were searched. Articles that described cortical activity during walking and balance tasks in older adults and in those with PD were screened by the reviewers. Thirty-seven full-text articles were included for review, following an initial yield of 566 studies. This review summarizes study findings, where increased cortical activity appears to be required for older adults and further for participants with PD to perform walking and balance tasks, but specific activation patterns vary with the demands of the particular task. Studies attributed cortical activation to compensatory mechanisms for underlying age- or PD-related deficits in automatic movement control. However, a lack of standardization within the reviewed studies was evident from the wide range of study protocols, instruments, regions of interest, outcomes and interpretation of outcomes that were reported. Unstandardized data collection, processing and reporting limited the clinical relevance and interpretation of study findings. Future work to standardize approaches to the measurement of cortical activity during walking and balance tasks in older adults and people with PD with fNIRS and EEG systems is needed, which will allow direct comparison of results and ensure robust data collection/reporting. Based on the reviewed articles we provide clinical and future research recommendations.",

Although the social and health outcomes of social isolation are well documented, evidence regarding the prevention of isolation in later life remains scarce. This article addresses this by presenting the findings from a literature review focusing on the identification, assessment, prevention, and intervention strategies relevant to social isolation in older age. The paper first addresses the issues of identification and assessment, using an ecological framework to identify the risk factors for social isolation at four levels: individual, relationship, community, and societal. It then reviews different types of interventions to reduce or prevent social isolation in later life, including one-to-one, group, service provision, technology-based, neighbourhood, and structural interventions. The paper discusses both the opportunities and the constraints associated with these different approaches. The discussion highlights future directions for research, emphasising the need for a cultural change from \u2018cure\u2019 to \u2018prevention\u2019 of social isolation across the life-course, and the importance of acknowledging greater diversity within the ageing population.",

However, these conditions differ in their pathophysiology and impact on health. CD is an autoimmune disorder of the intestine, and is associated with a wide range of disorders, pre- and post-diagnosis. Its autoimmune and inflammatory nature raises concerns about its potential effects on mortality and morbidity. Here we review the data on the health impact CD or NCGS may have prospectively, and report on the role of a gluten-free diet (GFD) in this respect. Since study designs have been heterogeneous, we focus on studies of treated patients with a biopsy-proven diagnosis of CD, to eliminate possible bias from misdiagnosis. The review revealed a moderately increased mortality risk among CD patients, mainly attributed to cardiovascular disease and malignancy. Other long-term morbidities of CD include autoimmune disorders, nutritional deficiencies, impaired bone health, reproductive abnormalities, and neurologic and neuropsychiatric disorders, which are substantially improved, and some of them even completely treated, after strict adherence to a GFD. For NCGS, the literature is too limited and its long-term complications are unknown.",

People living with dementia or mental health disorders as well as informal carers have been separately described as socially excluded. The objective of this systematic narrative review was to examine the extent to which social exclusion experienced by adult informal carers of people living with dementia or severe mental health disorders has been identified and described in research literature. It synthesised qualitative and quantitative evidence and included the perspectives of carers themselves and of professionals. Eight electronic databases (1997\u20132017) were searched. Five relevant studies published between 2010 and 2016 were identified. All were qualitative and used interviews and focus groups. Study quality was variable and most were European. Two focused on carers of people living with dementia and three on carers of people with mental health disorders. Four investigated carers\u2019 perspectives and experiences of social exclusion directly (total of 137 carer participants, predominantly parents, spouses and adult children), while the fifth focused on the perceptions of 65 participants working in health and social care. Stigma, financial difficulties and social isolation were highlighted in four studies and the challenges for carers in engaging in leisure activities were described in the fifth. Most conceptualised social exclusion as a form of stigma, or as resulting from stigma. One presented social exclusion as an element of carer burden. Two explicitly discussed the negative effects of social exclusion on carers. The dearth of research and the lack of specificity about social exclusion in carers was surprising. Future research should investigate aspects of social exclusion that may adversely affect carer wellbeing.",

     "abstract": "Testosterone (T) is deeply involved in every step of the male sexual response. However, the occurrence of sexual disorders cannot be automatically related to a decline in T levels. In fact, this relationship is complicated by organic, relational and psychological factors, which can independently impair sexual function. For example, it is recognized that erectile dysfunction (ED) can result from vascular damage as well as from low levels of T. T therapy (TTh) can improve sexual function but meta-analyses show that it improves erectile function only in men with ED and overt hypogonadism. Similarly, impaired sexual desire can result from a wide range of organic, relational and psychological factors, although it is recognized as one of the most specific symptoms of hypogonadism. Accordingly, low desire is improved by TTh in men with overt hypogonadism. The association between low T levels and delayed ejaculation has not been well studied and needs further confirmation, as does the role of TTh in such cases. Meta-analyses have found that TTh can improve orgasmic function in hypogonadal men. Clinicians should bear in mind that sexual dysfunctions have multifactorial causes and hypogonadism represents only one of these. Only hypogonadal men are likely to improve their sexual symptoms when treated with TTh. The assessment of serum T levels is mandatory before patients are prescribed TTh, as are the assessment and possible treatment of other concomitant conditions.",

     "abstract": "Two-thirds of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have arterial hypertension. Hypertension increases the incidence of both micro- and macrovascular complications in these patients, while the co-existence of these two major risk factors leads to a four-fold increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with normotensive non-diabetic controls. The aim of this article is to comprehensively review the literature and present updated information on targets for blood pressure (BP) and on the management of hypertension in patients with T2DM. A BP target of <140/90\u202fmmHg applies to most patients, but individualization is always important. All classes of antihypertensive drugs can be used in the management of hypertension in patients with T2DM, as long as they are effective and safe and after taking co-morbidities into account. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the ideal choice for initial or early treatment of hypertension in patients with T2DM and albuminuria. Combination of two or more drugs seems to be inevitable as most of these patients demonstrate resistant hypertension. The combination of ACE inhibitors with ARBs should be avoided. Thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics might be beneficial, alone or in a fixed-dose combination with ACE inhibitors or ARBs. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) constitute an ideal option as a second- or third-line agent. Beta-blockers are not considered as first-line antihypertensive agents, except for those patients with heart failure or previous myocardial infarction. The addition of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists to a triple-drug therapy seems the next ideal step. Gender-specific characteristics regarding BP, T2DM and CVD should be taken into consideration, even if different recommendations do not exist yet.",

The higher prevalence of RA in women than in men may originate from differences in sex hormone levels or types. Ethnicity may interact with hormonal factors to produce various observed differences in the prevalence of RA. Oral contraceptives (OCs) are a source of exogenous sex hormones and can affect the prevalence of RA. We investigated the effects of OCs on RA in Korean menopausal women using a national data set. Data were collected from a cross-sectional study of 8789 eligible participants who completed the 2008\u20132012 Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. To balance the distribution of baseline characteristics between those participants who had ever used OCs and those who had not, we employed propensity score matching to adjust for differences. We calculated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the effects of OCs on the incidence of RA. The development of RA in Korean women rapidly increased during the perimenopause. After propensity score matching, the use of OCs was associated with RA (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01\u20131.51, P\u202f=\u202f0.04).

This has implications for health, quality of life, independence and economic circumstances. Improvements in nutrition are known to bring tangible benefits to older people and many age-related diseases and conditions can be prevented, modulated or ameliorated by good nutrition. However, practical and realistic approaches are required to optimize diet and food intake in older adults. One area where improvements can be made relates to appetite. Encouraging older adults to prepare meals can increase appetite and food intake, and providing opportunities for older adults to eat a wide variety of foods, in company, is a simple strategy to increase food intake.The protein requirement of older adults is subject to controversy and although considered the most satiating macronutrient, it appears that protein does not elicit as great a satiating effect in older adults as it does in younger individuals. This indicates that there is potential to increase protein intake without impacting on overall energy intake. Other areas where simple practical improvements can be made include both packaging of foods that are easy to prepare and the education of older adults on the safe storage and preparation of food. Research into improving the diets and nutritional status of older adults has indicated that many of the strategies can be easily and cost-effectively undertaken.",

     "abstract": "The microbiome not only represents a vital modifier of health and disease, but is a clinically important drug target. Therefore, study of the impact of the human microbiome on drug metabolism, toxicity and efficacy is urgently needed. This review focuses on gut and vaginal microbiomes, and the effect of those microbiomes or components thereof on the pharmacokinetics of specific chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapies, anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drugs. In some cases, the presence of specific bacterial species within the microbiome can alter the metabolism of certain drugs, such as chemotherapeutic agents and antiviral drugs. These microbiota\u2013drug interactions are identified mostly through studies using germ-free or microbiome-depleted animal models, or by the administration of specific bacterial isolates. The biotransformation of drugs can cause drug-related toxicities; however, biotransformation also provides a mechanism by which drug developers could exploit host microbiota to create more site-specific drugs. Within this review we consider the importance of the route of drug administration and interactions with microbiota at various mucosal sites. Notably, we discuss the potential utility of bacterial therapeutics in altering the microbiome to enhance therapeutic efficacy and clinical outcomes in a personalized fashion. Based on the data to date, there is a clinically important relationship between microbiota and drug metabolism throughout the lifespan; therefore, profiling of the human microbiome will be essential in order to understand the mechanisms by which these microbiota\u2013drug interactions occur and the degree to which this complex interplay affects drug efficacy.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia is an age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass and function that results in disability and loss of independence. It affects up to 30% of older adults. Exercise (particularly progressive resistance training) and nutrition are key strategies in preventing and reversing declines in muscle mass, strength and power during ageing, but many sarcopenic older adults fail to meet recommended levels of both physical activity and dietary nutrient intake. Assistive technology (AT) describes devices or systems used to maintain or improve physical functioning. These may help sarcopenic older adults to maintain independence, and also to achieve adequate physical activity and nutrition. There is a paucity of research exploring the use of AT in sarcopenic patients, but there is evidence that AT, including walking aids, may reduce functional decline in other populations with disability. Newer technologies, such as interactive and virtual reality games, as well as wearable devices and smartphone applications, smart homes, 3D printed foods, exoskeletons and robotics, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation also hold promise for improving engagement in physical activity and nutrition behaviours to prevent further functional declines. While AT may be beneficial for sarcopenic patients, clinicians should be aware of its potential limitations. In particular, there are high rates of patient abandonment of AT, which may be minimised by appropriate training and monitoring of use. Clinicians should preferentially prescribe AT devices which promote physical activity. Further research is required in sarcopenic populations to identify strategies for effective use of current and emerging AT devices.",

Validity was interpreted using correlation coefficients (CC) and percentage error for agreement between reference devices or gold-standard validation methods Reliability was compared using mean differences or ranges (under- or overestimation) of step count and activity time.Total sample size was 290 adults, mean age of 70.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.8\u202fyears and females constituting 46.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f26.1%. The studies evaluated eight different consumer wearables used by community-dwelling adults with a range of co-morbidities. Daily step count for all consumer wearables correlated highly with validation criterion, especially the ActiGraph device: intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were 0.94 for Fitbit One, 0.94 for Zip, 0.86 for Charge HR and 0.96 for Misfit Shine. Slower walking pace and impaired ambulation reduced the levels of agreement. Daily step count captured by Fitbit Zip was on average 7117 (\u00b15,880.6), which was overestimated by five of the eight consumer wearables compared with reference devices (range 167.6\u20132,690.3 steps/day). Measurement of activity duration was accurate compared with reference devices, yet less so than step count.In older, community-dwelling adults, consumer wearables accurately measure step count and activity duration, as confirmed by reference devices and validation methods Further research is required to understand how co-morbidities, gait and activity levels interact with monitoring in free-living environments.",

However, despite the potential benefits of these interventions, they have had varying success and the sustained uptake of the recommended lifestyle modifications is limited. This paper reviews research on the impact of lifestyle interventions aimed at improving health and health behaviours in women with T2DM. In a systematic review of the literature, empirical literature from 2011 to 2017 is examined to explore the effects of various lifestyle interventions on a number of objective and subjective health indicators in women with T2DM. A total of 18 intervention studies in women aged between 21 and 75 years were included in this narrative review. Interventions included education/counselling, exercise, diet, or combined components of varying duration. The included studies used a variety of objective indicators, including glycaemic control, lipid profile and anthropometric indices, as well as a number of diabetes-specific and generic subjective scales (for example, the Diabetes Problem Solving Inventory and the Short Form 36). Significant heterogeneity was noted in the interventions and also the study findings, although exercise interventions tended to yield the most consistent benefit in relation to glycaemic control, while exercise/dietary interventions generally improved anthropometric indices. The findings from this review did not consistently suggest the greater value of any one type of intervention. Future research should consider interventions that target multiple health behaviours and emphasize health literacy, self-efficacy, and problem-solving skills.",

This review aims to understand which exercise-based interventions are effective in improving function for older adults who experience unplanned admissions.Database searches identified randomised control trials (RCTs) comparing exercise-based interventions with usual hospital care. The primary outcome was functional status measured by activities of daily living (ADL) scores. Secondary outcomes were length of hospital stay (LOS), mortality and readmissions. Sub-group meta-analyses were conducted on interventions delivered in-hospital only compared with interventions provided both in hospital and after discharge.After reviewing 8365 studies, nine were eligible for inclusion. Seven were included in the meta-analysis. Participants from five countries had a mean age of 79 years (1602 participants). Usual care varied considerably and the interventions showed heterogeneity, with different combinations of strengthening, resistance, high-intensity or mobility exercises. There were limited descriptions of exercise intervention delivery and participant adherence. There is low-quality evidence supporting exercise interventions that have both in-hospital and post-discharge components (3 trials, SMD 0.56 (\u22120.02, 1.13)). Trials involving only in-hospital interventions were inconclusive for functional gains (5 trials, SMD \u22120.04 (\u22120.31, 0.22)).Exercise-based rehabilitation for older patients after emergency hospitalisation improves functional ability if the intervention starts in hospital and continues after discharge. No conclusions can be made regarding the effective exercise \u2018dose\u2019 or content.Understanding the components of exercise interventions will improve service planning and delivery. Further studies are needed to understand the effective \u2018dose\u2019 and content of exercise for hospitalised older adults.",

     "abstract": "Alcohol intake affects the female body differently than it affects the male body. This is caused by females\u2019 lower levels of dehydrogenase enzymes, the enzyme that breaks down alcohol, coupled with the higher fat/water ratio of the female body. Both these factors cause alcohol levels to rise more quickly after ingestion in women than in men. This makes females more vulnerable to alcohol\u2019s harmful effects, and consequently women tend to develop alcohol-related diseases earlier in life than do men. As women age and go through menopause, they experience changes in body composition and life changes like retirement or loss of a loved one. The disparity between men\u2019s and women\u2019s rates of alcohol consumption decreases, especially in last 2 decades. Stress and depression related to menopause may trigger the onset of alcohol abuse or worsen established alcohol misuse. Alcohol abuse decreases quality of life and any potential positive effects of moderate alcohol intake are minuscule in comparison to the adverse effects caused by alcohol abuse. Further, due to social stigmas, women tend to have more difficulty gaining access to treatment and recovering from alcohol dependence than do men. Current research on interventions and treatments that aim to reduce alcohol use disorder (AUD) or to prevent its occurrence in middle-aged and elderly women is limited. We provide an overview of drinking patterns, and of the prevalence, risk factors, health impacts and treatment challenges of AUD for women as they progress through middle and older age.",

Based on the concept of quality of life, we considered that the patient required treatment if she herself believed that she required it, on the basis of the severity of at least one of her menopausal symptoms. To obtain an optimal MRS cut-off score associated with the need for treatment, an ROC curve analysis was performed.The symptoms rated \u201cvery severe\u201d on the MRS (i.e. that most require treatment) were physical and mental exhaustion (95.8% of women) and muscle and joint discomfort (95.1%). In total, 378 women (88.5%) considered that their symptoms required treatment. The ROC curve analysis determined that the optimal cut-off score on the MRS to indicate the need for treatment would be 14 (area under the curve 0.86, p\u202f<\u202f0.0001). This score achieved 76.5% sensitivity and 83.6% specificity.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the efficacy of telehealth methods in delivering malnutrition-related interventions to community-dwelling older adults. Studies in any language were searched in five electronic databases from inception to 2nd November 2017. Quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and the GRADE approach. Nine studies were identified, with results published across 13 included publications, which had mostly low to unclear risk of bias. There were two interventions delivered to disease-specific groups, one with kidney disease and one with cancer; the remaining seven interventions were delivered to patients with mixed morbidities following discharge from an inpatient facility. Seven studies delivered telehealth via telephone consultations and two used internet-enabled telemedicine devices. Ten meta-analyses were performed. Malnutrition-focused telehealth interventions were found to improve protein intake in older adults by 0.13\u202fg/kg body weight per day ([95%CI: 0.01\u20130.25]; P\u202f=\u202f.03; n\u202f=\u202f2 studies; n\u202f=\u202f200 participants; I2\u202f=\u202f41%; GRADE level: low) and to improve quality of life (standardised mean difference: 0.55 [95%CI: 0.11\u20130.99]; P\u202f=\u202f.01; n\u202f=\u202f4 studies with n\u202f=\u202f9 quality-of-life tools; n\u202f=\u202f248 participants; I2\u202f=\u202f84%: GRADE level: very low).

     "abstract": "One in three older adults fall annually, in part due to impairments in the physiological systems that make up the postural control (PC) system. Exercise, particularly balance training, helps to prevent deterioration and even to improve outcomes in the PC system. Exergaming (exercise-gaming) is interactive computer gaming whereby an individual moves the body in response to onscreen cues in a playful format. Exergaming is an alternative method to standard practice for improving PC outcomes, which has been shown to reduce the risk of falling. Exergaming has received research attention, yet the intervention is still in its infancy. There could be benefit in exploring the movements trained with respect to a framework known for identifying underlying deficits in the PC system, the Systems Framework for Postural Control (SFPC). This may help target areas for improvement in balance training using exergames and shed light on the impact for fall prevention. A literature search was therefore conducted across six databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, PubMed, ISI, SPORTdiscus and Science Direct) using a range of search terms and combinations relating to exergaming, balance, exercise, falls and elderly. Quality assessment was conducted using the PEDro Scale and a custom-made quality assessment tool. Movements were rated by two reviewers based on the 9 operational definitions of the SFPC. Eighteen publications were included in the analysis, with a mean PEDro score of 5.6 (1.5). Overall, 4.99 (1.27) of the 9 operational definitions of the SFPC are trained in exergaming interventions. Exergaming does encourage individuals to stand up (3), lean while standing (4), move upper limbs and turn heads (6) and dual-task while standing (9), to some extent move the body forwards, backwards and sideways (1), and coordinate movements (2) but hardly at all to kick, hop, jump or walk (7), or to force a postural reaction from a physical force to the individual (5) and it does not mimic actual changes in sensory context (8). This is the first review, to our knowledge, that synthesises the literature on movements trained in exergaming interventions with respect to an established theoretical framework for PC. This review could provide useful information for designing exergames with PC outcomes in mind, which could help target specific exergames for multi-factorial training to overcome balance deficits. Some elements of PC are too unsafe to be trained using exergames, such as restricting sensory inputs or applying physical perturbations to an individual to elicit postural responses.",

     "abstract": "Approximately 10\u201320% of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cases are diagnosed after 60 years of age. Due to the high prevalence of conditions mimicking IBD at older age \u2013 including bowel disease associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diverticulitis, and microscopic colitis \u2013 differential diagnosis of IBD among older adults is frequently delayed.Late-onset IBD is characterized by a predominance of colonic disease and an overall milder disease course; disease progression and new intestinal manifestations are rare. However, older patients are less able to tolerate inflammation and their risk of mortality from severe disease is increased.Management of late-onset IBD has been insufficiently studied since older adults are underrepresented in clinical trials and specific problems of older patients such as incontinence have not been addressed. To date, treatment generally follows the same principles as in the younger. However, older patients are at higher risk of severe adverse effects of the disease and its treatments, including bone and muscle loss, infections and lymphoma. Therefore, the safety profile of a given drug is of paramount importance in older patients with IBD. Colectomy with ileo-anal pouch anastomosis for refractory ulcerative colitis can be performed safely, although functional results may be inferior to those in middle-aged patients. To decrease mortality among older patients, a timely surgical intervention is important.Patients with late-onset IBD frequently develop colorectal carcinoma within 8 years of diagnosis; therefore, colorectal cancer screening immediately after diagnosis should be considered. Further, the clinical care of older patients with IBD needs to extend to overall health, including nutrition, vaccination, bone, muscle and mental health.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenic obesity (SO) represents a major public health concern. Physical activity has been recommended to minimize functional decline in the elderly and it may also be relevant to SO management. The purpose of this systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to investigate the effects of different exercise modalities, alone or combined with nutritional supplementation, on body composition, muscle strength and physical function in healthy community-dwelling older adults with SO.A literature search was performed using the PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL and Cochrane Plus databases. The main inclusion criteria were that the papers were English-language reports of RCTs involving healthy community-dwelling adults aged \u226560 years with SO. The initial search identified 2073 publications from the 4 databases and 72 additional records; 42 full-text records were assessed for eligibility and 8 articles were finally included. The search was conducted from December 1, 2017 to January 8, 2018. The types of exercises were resistance and aerobic training, either alone or combined, and whole-body electromyostimulation. Protein supplementation was included in three studies. The diversity of the methodologies employed and of the results observed does not allow us to reach a clear conclusion. Whereas five of the studies reported improvements in obesity, results were contradictory concerning muscle mass. Increases in muscle strength appeared especially with resistance training and do not seem to be linked to protein supplementation. On the other hand, improvements in physical function were reported in programs combining aerobic and resistance training with nutritional supplementation. We believe that it is of the utmost importance that a certain degree of homogeneity is kept concerning the methods and criteria used in the diagnosis of SO, so that the effects of specific physical exercise programs, whether alone or combined with nutritional supplements, can be assessed with precision.",

At their admission to the medical wards of Angers University Hospital (France), all inpatients aged \u226565 years were screened with the BGA. Its 6 items are: age \u226585 years, male gender, polypharmacy (i.e., \u22655 drugs per day), non-use of home-help services, history of falls in the previous 6 months, and temporal disorientation (i.e., inability to give the month and/or year). Three levels (low, intermediate and high) of risk of adverse health events had previously been identified, based on different combinations of BGA items. Patients were separated into 2 groups using the occurrence of in-hospital death. The length of stay was calculated as the number of days in hospital using the hospital registry. The use of psychoactive drugs and the reason for admission were used as covariates.Older inpatients who died were more frequently admitted for an acute organ failure (P\u202f<\u202f0.001). Cox regression models showed that a priori intermediate risk (HR\u202f=\u202f1.89, P\u202f<\u202f.001) and high risk (HR\u202f=\u202f2.34, P\u202f<\u202f.001) risk levels predicted in-hospital mortality.

Basic demographic information, medical history and lifestyle data including physical activity were collected from study participants. Dietary intake was assessed through a validated food frequency questionnaire. A posteriori dietary patterns were identified using Principal Component Analysis. Adherence to an a priori dietary pattern, the Mediterranean dietary pattern, was evaluated through the Mediterranean Dietary Score (MedDietScore).BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio.Overweight and obese women constituted 39.5% and 29.1% of the sample respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the Dietary Component 2 (characterized by high consumption of unrefined cereals and legumes and low consumption of refined cereals) was negatively associated with BMI (beta\u202f=\u202f\u22120.104, p\u202f=\u202f0.057), waist circumference (beta\u202f=\u202f\u22120.120, p\u202f=\u202f0.019) and waist-to-height ratio (beta\u202f=\u202f\u22120.105, p\u202f=\u202f0.038).

The associations were independent of age, years since menopause, energy intake and physical exercise. Negative associations were also found between the MedDietScore and the obesity indices, which became, however, non-significant when implausible energy reports were excluded from the analyses.Our results indicate that different dietary patterns are positively or negatively associated with obesity in postmenopausal women.

Nowadays older women are more active than they were in the past, and the development of POP disrupts quality of life and impairs social and personal activities. The menopausal transition is a time of vulnerability, during which many women start experiencing symptoms and signs of POP. The role of hormonal changes or of hormonal therapies in influencing the development or progression of POP has been explored extensively. The management of POP requires considerable clinical skills. Correct diagnosis and characterization of the prolapse and an identification of the individual woman\u2019s most bothersome symptoms are the hallmark of appropriate initial management. Therapy is multimodal and often multidisciplinary, and requires a competence in pelvic medicine and surgery. The integration of hormonal, non-hormonal and surgical strategies is important and needs to be adjusted to changing circumstances on an individualized basis. When surgery is required, optimal management requires clinicians who are familiar with the advantages and disadvantages of all the available strategies and who are able to use these strategies in a tailored manner. Complex cases should be sent to specialist referral centers. Management of POP should be integrated into the practice of healthcare professionals dealing in menopause.",

Cross-sectional data from 3552 French older adults were used to conduct a multiple linear regression analysis looking at the association between FoF and MI abilities after controlling for several factors (e.g. gender, age, history of falls). MI abilities were significantly lower in older adults reporting a FoF compared with those without this fear. The presence of lower MI abilities, reflecting deficits in gait control, may explain why older people with a FoF are at higher risk of falling.",

     "abstract": "The capacity of the heart to heal after a myocardial infarction is not enough to restore normal cardiac function. Fortunately, delivery of therapeutics such as stem cells, growth factors, exosomes and small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA), among other bioactive molecules, has been shown to enhance heart repair and improve cardiac function. Furthermore, new delivery systems for these therapeutic agents have enhanced their regenerative and cardioprotective potential. In particular, nano- and microparticles (NPs and MPs) are promising. These systems may be administered directly in the infarcted myocardium or reach the heart after intravenous injection due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect or active targeting. Thus, NPs and MPs have made it possible to administer a wide range of potential drugs, including therapeutic molecules and/or stem cells, and evidence in favor of their use has been reported in several preclinical studies. Here, we review the studies done over the last 5 years using NPs and MPs loaded with therapeutics for repairing cardiac tissue after a myocardial infarction, and discuss some of the advances, challenges and future prospects in this field. In addition, we address the application of NPs and MPs for cardioprotective purposes.",

We first examined the seasonality of PA, SB, and nighttime sleep, stratified by age group. Second, we examined the influence of meteorological factors. Third, we modeled the potential seasonality of the all-cause mortality risk due to the seasonality of PA and SB, by using previously published relative risks.Levels of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA were higher in summer than in winter among middle-aged (seasonal variation\u202f=\u202f18.1 and 14.8\u202fmin/day) and young-elderly adults (12.8 and 8.6\u202fmin/day). The pattern was explained by ambient temperature and sunlight hours. Nighttime sleep was 31.8\u202fmin/day longer in winter among middle-aged adults. SB did not show a seasonal pattern. No seasonality in activity levels was observed among old-elderly adults. The all-cause mortality risk may be higher in winter than in summer due to the accumulation of low levels of moderate to vigorous PA and high levels of SB.PA has a larger degree of seasonality than SB and nighttime sleep among middle-aged and young-elderly adults. SB appears strongly ingrained in daily routine. Recommending the interruption of SB with light PA might be a good starting point for public health institutions.",

Gait and balance disorders in this population are among the most common causes of falls and negatively influence quality of life and survivorship. Although falls are a major public health problem and guidelines/recommendations are available to physicians, many are fully aware of different assessments, tools, and resources available for intervention. Given the risk for potentially devastating outcomes if severe injuries occur secondary to a fall, fall prevention strategies in clinical offices is a timely consideration in today\u2019s health care landscape. This paper presents a three-tier model, comprising assessment, prevention, and intervention, to highlight methods, proactive programs, and innovative tools and technology that have been developed for fall prevention. Awareness of these resources will enhance the clinician\u2019s ability to accurately assess balance and gait, which can improve physical function, and decrease the risk of falls for both average-risk and high-risk older adults.",

The elevated risk associated with depression is not limited to clinical major depressive disorder but also extends to sub-syndromal depressive symptoms and constructs with overlapping characteristics, such as vital exhaustion. Multiple pathophysiological pathways are involved in the relationship between depressive symptoms and atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations and progression. These underlying mechanisms are not yet fully understood and need further clarification. This review examines inflammation and endothelium dysfunction as potential biological factors involved in the relationship between depressive symptoms and atherosclerosis. It has been reported that systemic inflammation and psychological factors interact through complex pathophysiological and behavioral mechanisms and one question that has been raised concerns whether the inflammation drives depression or vice versa, or whether the association is merely coincidental. Although further investigation is needed, including well-designed prospective studies, to address this question thoroughly, it seems that there is a feedback relationship, although the biological pathways of each direction may be distinct.",

A literature search was conducted to identify physical exercise intervention studies that were randomized and controlled and that assessed gait ability in older LTNH residents using both walking speed and timed up-and-go (TUG) tests simultaneously. Together, these tests have been defined under the term \u201cgait ability\u201d; they are widely used to screen for impaired physical function, and can predict accelerated functional decline, difficulty with activities of daily living (ADL), falls, and disability in older adults. Multicomponent physical exercise programs are effective in improving or maintaining gait ability in older LTNH residents. The studies included in this review show substantial heterogeneity in terms of participant characteristics (age, baseline TUG performance, and walking speed), types of evaluated intervention (multicomponent and gait retraining programs), duration of the intervention (ranging from four weeks to 12 months), duration of physical exercise sessions (ranging from 30\u202fmin to 1\u202fh), and exercise intensity (from 40% to 60\u201370% RM).

However, the results of this review should encourage the gathering of additional evidence to support the use of multicomponent exercise programs by older individuals.",

PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and APA PsycNET databases were screened on 6 March 2017 for original research on multimorbidity and HrQoL in adults aged 40\u201365 years from the general population. Studies focused on index conditions, using single-item HrQoL measures, unlikely to represent the general population (e.g. primary care), and papers that were not in the English language were excluded. A narrative synthesis was presented due to heterogeneity in the measurement of multimorbidity. Of the 2557 articles, 83 underwent full text screening and 8 were included in the review. Included studies were of moderate to high quality and no exclusions were made on the basis of quality or bias. Multimorbidity was associated with poorer HrQoL at mid-life. Two cross-sectional studies found that adults with multimorbidity at early mid-life reported poorer HrQoL than adults with multimorbidity at late mid-life, while another found the reverse. Two distinct disease clusters were identified: mental health conditions and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Those in the mental health cluster reported poorer HrQoL than those in the CVD cluster, women more so than men. Limitations of the selected studies include lack of longitudinal evidence, use of self-reported conditions and no assessment of disease severity. Multimorbidity is associated with poor HrQoL at mid-life at the population level, with some evidence of differences in association with age and disease cluster and sparse evidence on sex differences. Longitudinal research using a weighted disease severity index and multimorbidity trajectories is needed to strengthen the evidence base.",

Even so, AAA appears more detrimental in women, who experience a higher risk of aneurysm rupture and a worse outcome after surgery than men. Why women are privileged from yet are worse off once affected has been attributed to an effect of sex hormones. This review summarizes the knowledge of sex differences in AAA and addresses the changes in the aneurysm wall from a gender perspective.Standard reporting guidelines set by the PRISMA Group were followed to identify studies examining AAA from a gender perspective. Relevant reports were identified using two electronic databases: PubMed and Web of Science. The systematic search was performed in two stages: firstly, using the terms AAA and gender/sex/women; and secondly, adding the terms \u201celastin\u201d, \u201ccollagen\u201d and \u201cvascular smooth muscle cells\u201d, in order to filter the search for studies relevant to our focus on the aneurysm wall.Current studies support the theory that sex has an effect on aneurysm formation, yet are inconclusive about whether or not aneurysm formation is dependent on female/male sex hormones or a lack thereof. The studies in women are scarce and out of those most reports primarily address other end-points, which limit their ability to illuminate an effect of sex on aneurysm formation. The complexity of the human menstrual cycle and menopausal transition are difficult to mimic in animal models, which limit their applicability to AAA formation in humans.",

Recent research on T2DM-induced bone fragility shows that bone mineral density (BMD) is often normal or even slightly elevated. However, bone turnover may be decreased and bone material and microstructural properties are altered, especially when microvascular complications are present. Besides bone fragility, extra-skeletal factors leading to an increased propensity to experience falls may also contribute to the increased fracture risk in T2DM, such as peripheral neuropathy, retinopathy and diabetes medication (e.g. insulin use). One of the probable additional contributing factors to the increased fall and fracture risks in T2DM is sarcopenia, the age-related decline in skeletal muscle mass, quality and function. Although the association between sarcopenia, fall risk, and fracture risk has been studied in the general population, few studies have examined the association between T2DM and muscle tissue and the risks of falls and fractures.

     "abstract": "Heart failure is a complex disease, which is presented differently by men and women. Several studies have shown that reproductive factors, such as age at natural menopause, parity and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), may play a role in the development of heart failure. Shared genetics may provide clues to underlying mechanisms; however, this has never been examined. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to explore whether any reproductive factor is potentially related to heart failure in women, based on genetic similarities. Conducting a systematic literature review, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with reproductive factors, heart failure and its risk factors were extracted from recent genome-wide association studies. We tested whether there was any overlap between the SNPs and their proxies of reproductive risk factors with those known for heart failure or its risk factors. In total, 520 genetic variants were found that are associated with reproductive factors, namely age at menarche, age at natural menopause, menstrual cycle length, PCOS, preeclampsia, preterm delivery and spontaneous dizygotic twinning. For heart failure and associated phenotypes, 25 variants were found. Genetic variants for reproductive factors did not overlap with those for heart failure. However, age at menarche, gestational diabetes and PCOS were found to be genetically linked to risk factors for heart failure, such as atrial fibrillation, diabetes and smoking. Corresponding implicated genes, such as TNNI3K, ErbB3, MKL2, MTNR1B and PRKD1, may explain the associations between reproductive factors and heart failure. Exact effector mechanisms of these genes remain to be investigated further.",

Additionally, it provides assistance in the counselling of women who are planning to use assisted reproductive techniques (ART). This review examines current methods of testing ovarian reserve and their application. The most useful methods of assessing ovarian reserve are ultrasonographic count of ovarian antral follicles (AFC) and serum tests of both the anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) level and the third-day level of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). However, there are limitations to the currently used methods of testing ovarian reserve, especially in relation to their specificity and sensitivity.

The CVD risk was estimated by the carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and the Framingham score. Blood reduced glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG), plasma malondialdehyde-(MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal-(HNE) protein adducts were analyzed.Significantly greater blood GSSG/GSH ratio and plasma MDA/HNE protein adducts were observed in sarcopenic than in non-sarcopenic patients. A logistic regression model showed a close relationship between serum HNE and MDA adducts and sarcopenia (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.133, 95% CI 1.057\u20131.215, and OR\u00a0=\u00a01.592, 95% CI 1.015\u20131.991, respectively). Linear and logistic regression analysis evidenced strong associations between the IMT or the Framingham CVD risk category and blood GSSG/GSH or serum HNE protein adducts in the S-O group.Circulating markers of oxidative stress are increased in sarcopenia and related to CVD risk in sarcopenic obesity, suggesting that redox balance analysis would be a useful part of a multidimensional evaluation in aging.

Our aim was to evaluate the quantitative benefits, harms, and cost-effectiveness of lowering the starting age of breast cancer screening in the Dutch general population.Economic modelling with a lifelong perspective compared biennial screening for women aged 48\u201374\u202fyears and for women aged 46\u201374\u202fyears with the current Dutch screening programme, which screen women between the ages of 50 and 74\u202fyears. Tumour deaths prevented, years of life saved (YOLS), false-positive rates, radiation-induced tumours, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were evaluated.Starting the screening at 48 instead of 50 years of age led to increases in: the number of small tumours detected (4.0%), tumour deaths prevented (5.6%), false positives (9.2%), YOLS (5.6%), radiation-induced tumours (14.7%), and costs (4.1%). Starting the screening at 46 instead of 48 years of age increased the number of small tumours detected (3.3%), tumour deaths prevented (4.2%), false positives (8.8%), YOLS (3.7%), radiation-induced tumours (15.2%), and costs (4.0%). The ICER was \u20ac5600/YOLS for the 48\u201374 scenario and \u20ac5600/YOLS for the 46\u201374 scenario.Women could benefit from lowering the starting age of screening as more breast cancer deaths would be averted. Starting regular breast cancer screening earlier is also cost-effective. As the number of additional expected harms is relatively small in both the scenarios examined, and the difference in ICERs is not large, introducing two additional screening rounds is justifiable.",

This study sought to identify the issues influencing pre-, peri- and post-menopausal women\u2019s intentions to perform MSA with a view to informing future interventions for these populations. Mixed methods guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) were used to explore factors that influence women\u2019s intentions to perform MSA. In stage one, 34 women participated in either a focus group or interview. Discussions were transcribed verbatim and analysed based on menopausal status using a deductive approach. In stage two, 186 women (M\u202f=\u202f47\u202fyears, SD\u202f=\u202f9) completed a questionnaire to assess participant demographics, levels of MSA, affective and instrumental attitudes, injunctive and descriptive norms, self-efficacy and perceived behavioural control. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, regression analyses and analysis of variances. Behavioural beliefs were: improved muscular health; psychological benefits; improved body shape. Normative beliefs were: health professionals; family members; work colleagues. Control beliefs were: equipment; motivation; time constraints; knowledge; physical capability; fear of judgement. However, these beliefs were not well established. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of intentions (spc2\u202f=\u202f0.11) followed by affective attitudes (spc2\u202f=\u202f0.09), with no significant differences on TPB variables between groups.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether informal caregiving was associated with markers of metabolism in a large, representative UK longitudinal study. We also investigated whether more intensive caregiving, as indicated by more caregiving hours, was associated with a less favourable metabolic profile.Using data on 9408 participants aged 16+ from the UK Household Longitudinal Study, we explored the relationship between caregiving and metabolic markers (blood pressure, total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, glycated haemoglobin and triglycerides). We additionally investigated the importance of caregiving intensity (number of hours spent caregiving per week). Associations between caregiving/caregiving intensity and metabolic markers were tested using gender-stratified linear regression models adjusted for age, household income, education, social class, chronic illness, number of dependent children in the household, body mass index and partnership status.Men who were informal caregivers had higher total cholesterol levels than non-caregivers (3.25% higher, 95% CI: 0.07, 6.53). Women caregivers also had higher total cholesterol levels and women providing intensive care (over 20\u202fh per week) had higher triglyceride levels (19.91% higher, 95% CI: 7.22, 34.10) and lower levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (8.46% lower, 95% CI: 14.51, 1.99); however, associations for women were attenuated in our final models.Informal caregiving is associated with less favourable lipid profiles. This may be one mechanism through which informal caregiving is associated with increased disease risk. The health of informal caregivers should be a priority for public health.",

     "abstract": "Specific dietary strategies are the mainstay of management in most cases of dyslipidaemia, prior to or simultaneously with the initiation of a lipid-lowering agent. The exact approach differs according to the type of dyslipidaemia. In particular, a reduction in carbohydrates (mainly foods with a high glycaemic index) and their substitution with mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids is the main strategy in patients with high levels of triglycerides (Tg) and/or low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). A reduction in saturated and trans fatty acids, combined with an increased intake of specific dietary components, such as plant sterols, soy protein and red yeast rice, constitutes the more efficacious dietary approach in cases where levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) are elevated. A reduction in excessive body weight is beneficial in every type of dyslipidaemia, whereas increased physical activity is mostly effective in cases with low HDL-c and high Tg levels. With respect to the potential cardiovascular benefit of these dietary interventions, there is currently evidence for the Mediterranean diet. Potential benefit may derive also from single dietary components of that diet, such as legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts and omega-3 fatty acids, although to a lesser extent than with that general dietary pattern. The purpose of this review is to outline current knowledge regarding the recommended specific dietary pattern according to the type of dyslipidaemia and the evidence for the potential cardiovascular benefits of such approaches.",

Although we found significant gaps in the literature on CVD in WLHIV, data suggest that: HIV increases the risk of CVD in women even more than it does in men; certain cardiometabolic risk factors (such as obesity and metabolic syndrome) are more prevalent in WLHIV than their male counterparts; and risk factors such as hyperlipidaemia and hypertension are not optimally managed in this population. Clinicians working with WLHIV therefore need to be aware that this is a patient group at elevated cardiovascular risk, and should be familiar with relevant guidelines.",

In the contrast, for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients, no targeted agents are available. We hypothesized that artificial overexpression of HER2 in TNBC cells might induce sensitivity to anti-HER2 agents in these cells.TNBC cell lines were transduced using lentiviral HER2 overexpression particles. Functionality of HER2 was determined by protein analysis and localization studies. The tumorigenic potential of HER2 overexpressing cells was assessed by analysis of proliferation, migration and invasion capacity. Response to chemotherapeutic agents and anti-HER2 agents was determined by cell viability assays.We demonstrated functional overexpression of HER2 in TNBC cell lines of different subtypes. Whereas in cell types with more pronounced epithelial features (e.g. MDA-MB-468) HER2 overexpression increases proliferation and migration, in mesenchymal cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT-549) HER2 was able to further increase invasive potential. No changes were found in cancer stem cell characteristics or in response to chemotherapy, a trait of TNBC. When treated with anti-HER2 agents, however, HER2 overexpressing TNBC cells showed increased sensitivity to these agents.This proof-of-principle study demonstrates that reverse engineering of TNBC cells might offer a novel targeted treatment strategy for this most aggressive subtype of breast cancer.",

Serum SH levels, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ejection fraction (EF) \u226550% had been recorded at baseline (2000\u20132002). Of these participants, 2810 underwent repeat MRI at Exam 5 (2010\u20132012). Stratified by sex, linear mixed-effect models were used to test associations between SH and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) level [per 1 SD greater log-transformed (SH)] with baseline and change in LV structure. Models were adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, center, height, weight, education, physical activity and smoking, and, in women, for hormone therapy and years since menopause.LVM and M:V ratio.After a median of 9.1 years, higher free testosterone levels were independently associated with a modest increase in LVM (g/yr) in women [0.05 (95% CI 0.01, 0.10)] and men [0.16 (0.03, 0.28)], while higher SHBG levels were associated with less LVM change (g/yr) in women [\u22120.07 (\u22120.13, \u22120.01)] and men [\u22120.15 (\u22120.27, \u22120.02)]. In men, higher dehydroepiandrosterone and estradiol levels were associated with increased LVM. Among women, free testosterone levels were positively and SHBG levels inversely associated with change in M:V ratio.A more androgenic profile (higher free testosterone and lower SHBG levels) is associated with a greater increase in LVM in men and women and greater increase in M:V ratio in women over the course of 9 years.",

Basic demographics, clinical symptoms and staging of pelvic organ prolapse were assessed. A vaginal pessary was offered where appropriate.Demographics and clinical parameters were compared between women who were able to use a vaginal pessary for one year and those whose pessaries were dislodged within one year.A total of 779 women were recruited and had a vaginal pessary inserted. Of them, 528 women, with a mean age of 64.7 (SD 10.1) years, returned for one-year follow-up; 177 (33.5%) had their pessary dislodged within one year and 351 (66.5%) had been able to retain the pessary. Stage III or IV prolapse (OR 1.76), prolapse predominant at the apical compartment (OR 2.14) and larger genital hiatus (OR 1.63) were factors associated with dislodgment of the vaginal pessary. Age, body mass index, previous hysterectomy and short vagina were not associated with dislodgment. Nevertheless, 47.6% of women with stage III/IV prolapse could still keep the pessary for one year.Higher staging of prolapse, larger genital hiatus and apical compartment prolapse are clinical predictors for dislodgment of a vaginal pessary. Despite this, nearly half of women with stage III/IV prolapse were able to use a vaginal pessary for one year. Therefore, a vaginal pessary should be offered despite their staging of prolapse.",

Weight history was collected and anthropometric data were taken at study enrollment (from 1996 to 2000 for the SWHS, 2002\u20132006 for the SMHS). Information on functional status and current weight was collected at the most recent follow-up survey (from 2011 to 2015). Logistic regression analyses were applied to estimate the associations of body mass index (BMI), waist-hip-ratio (WHR), and weight changes with functional decline.After a median follow-up of 14.4 years (range 5.4\u201318.2 years), we found that BMI/WHR at or after middle age, and weight gain during adulthood were significantly associated with impaired walking ability and mental functioning. Being underweight after age 70 was associated with poorer hearing and/or vision as well as poorer memory. The associations between obesity and functional impairment were generally not modified by sex, comorbidity or exercise.Weight gain, obesity at or after middle age, and underweight after age 70 were associated with physical and mental functional impairments among elderly Chinese people. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining healthy weight to reduce age-related functional decline.",

The electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library were systematically searched for eligible studies. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined a priori. The selected studies were reviewed and data extraction was carried out by the reviewers. Two independent researchers assessed the quality of the included studies. Eighteen studies were included in this systematic review. UI prevalence estimates varied from 1% to 42.2%. Among the women with UI of any type, 12.5% to 79% had stress urinary incontinence. BMI, childhood enuresis, and high-impact exercising were found to be the main associated risk factors.

Secondary outcomes were surgical outcomes and duration of hospital stay. The sample size was powered at 50 participants per group (n\u00a0=\u00a0100) to compare \u0394AMH after hysterectomy with salpingectomy to \u0394AMH after standard hysterectomy.Between March 2013 and December 2016, 104 women, aged 30\u201355 years, were randomly allocated to hysterectomy with opportunistic bilateral salpingectomy (n\u00a0=\u00a052) or standard hysterectomy (n\u00a0=\u00a052).

     "abstract": "A likely contributor to pelvic floor disorders is injury and degradation of connective tissue components such as collagen and elastin, leading to weakening of the pelvic floor. Prior studies have found similar connective tissue component changes in women with cervical insufficiency (CI). However, the connection between pelvic floor disorders and cervical insufficiency has not previously been evaluated. Our objective was to determine whether a history of cervical insufficiency is associated with an increased risk of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence after controlling for confounders.The study used de-identified clinical data from a large multi-institution electronic health records HIPAA-compliant data web application, Explorys Inc. (Cleveland, Ohio, USA). Women with a history of at least one prior delivery after at least 20 weeks\u2019 gestation between the years 1999 and 2016 were identified. Logistic regression models were used to identify risk factors and adjust for confounders.The primary outcome was subsequent development of either stress incontinence or pelvic organ prolapse.A total of 1,182,650 women were identified, of whom 30,890 (2.6%) had a history of cervical cerclage or insufficiency. A history of cervical insufficiency was associated with an increased risk of either pelvic organ prolapse or stress urinary incontinence (aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.93, 95%CI: 1.84\u20132.02). A history of cervical insufficiency was more strongly associated with an increased risk of pelvic organ prolapse (aOR\u00a0=\u00a02.06, 95%CI: 1.91\u20132.21) than with stress urinary incontinence (aOR\u00a0=\u00a01.91, 95%CI: 1.80\u20132.02).A history of cervical insufficiency is associated with an increased risk of development of pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.",

Participants were categorised according to socio-economic indicators (education, occupation and household income) measured at baseline (1989\u20131993). Participants aged 55 years or older were included (n\u00a0=\u00a05434). DQ was assessed at baseline (1989\u20131993) and after 20 years (2009\u20132011) and quantified using the Dutch Healthy Diet Index, reflecting adherence to the Dutch guidelines for a healthy diet; scores can range from 0 (no adherence) to 80 (optimal adherence). Linear regression models were adjusted for sex, age, smoking status, BMI, physical activity level, total energy intake and mutually adjusted for the other socio-economic indicators.At baseline, scores on the Dutch Healthy Diet Index were 2.29 points higher for participants with the highest level of education than for those with the lowest level (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.23\u20133.36); in addition, they were more likely to have a higher DQ at follow-up (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a03.10, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.71\u20135.50), after adjustment for baseline DQ.

In a countrywide meta-analysis, multimorbidity was associated with significantly higher stress levels in all countries (especially India and Ghana) although characterized by moderate heterogeneity (I2\u00a0=\u00a054.6%). For single chronic conditions, notably high stress scores were observed for depression, stroke, and hearing problems.Chronic conditions and multimorbidity are associated with higher levels of stress in older adults in LMICs.

Clinical and anthropometric data were collected. Biochemical parameters, including total cholesterol (TC), HDL, LDL, triglycerides, glucose, insulin and 25-hydroxyvitamin-D [25(OH)D] were measured. Women meeting three or more of the following criteria were diagnosed with MetS: waist circumference >88\u00a0cm, triglycerides \u2265150\u00a0mg/dL, HDL <50\u00a0mg/dL, blood pressure \u2265130/85\u00a0mmHg and glucose \u2265100\u00a0mg/dL.

Despite the guidance provided by scientific societies and governmental bodies worldwide, many issues remain unresolved.To provide evidence regarding the impact of calcium intake on the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis and critically appraise current guidelines.Literature review and consensus of expert opinion.The recommended daily intake of calcium varies between 700 and 1200\u00a0mg of elemental calcium, depending on the endorsing source. Although calcium can be derived either from the diet or supplements, the former source is preferred. Intake below the recommended amount may increase fragility fracture risk; however, there is no consistent evidence that calcium supplementation at, or above, recommended levels reduces risk. The addition of vitamin D may minimally reduce fractures, mainly among institutionalised people. Excessive intake of calcium, defined as higher than 2000\u00a0mg/day, can be potentially harmful. Some studies demonstrated harm even at lower dosages. An increased risk for cardiovascular events, urolithiasis and even fractures has been found in association with excessive calcium intake, but this issue remains unresolved. In conclusion, an adequate intake of calcium is recommended for general bone health. Excessive calcium intake seems of no benefit, and could possibly be harmful.",

HF rarely occurs in isolation, with most patients having several co-existing diseases requiring multiple medications. There is a large evidence base for treatment of HF with reduced ejection fraction, or HFrEF; however, many of the trials did not include older people with multimorbidity so their findings should be applied to this group with some caution. The evidence for treatment of HF with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF, is much less well established in all age groups.Older people with HF are usually managed in primary care with input from specialist HF teams when needed. General practitioners are trained to take a generalist approach, which allows them to deliver holistic, person-centred care. The wider multidisciplinary team is also important during the patient\u2019s HF journey, with a particular need to consider palliative care towards the end of life.This article summarises the important aspects of HF management in older people from the perspective of primary care.",

The objective of this study was to systematically review the available evidence on TRT safety in men, specifically with respect to the risk of stroke. We identified publications from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up to May 2017. Articles eligible for review included observational studies evaluating TRT and the risk of stroke among men aged 18 or older. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing testosterone to placebo in men were also eligible, provided stroke was identified as an adverse event. Among seven cohort studies of hypogonadal men, one study reported that TRT was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio (HR) 0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.52\u20130.80). Another reported a similar decrease in risk (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.43\u20130.96) among treated men who achieved normalized levels of testosterone. Limitations in study design, including immortal time bias and residual confounding, may have influenced both of these results. The remaining observational studies did not report measures of association to estimate the independent risk of stroke associated with TRT. Among eight RCTs, a low frequency of stroke events (<5) was observed across both testosterone and control groups, thus precluding any definitive conclusions. Based on these findings, the association between TRT and the risk of stroke in men remains unclear, and further large and methodologically robust studies are needed to establish this relationship.",

PubMed and Embase databases were searched for publications on the following reproductive factors as potential risk factors for heart failure in women: age at menarche, duration and frequency of the menstrual cycle, reproductive lifespan, use of contraception, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), pregnancy characteristics (e.g. parity), pregnancy complications (e.g. preeclampsia), induced abortion, history of breastfeeding, fertility status, use of assisted reproductive methods, hysterectomy, age at menopause, and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT).Twenty-one studies were eligible for inclusion. Hypertensive pregnancy disorders, preterm delivery or small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants, shorter reproductive duration, and early menopause were risk factors for heart failure in women. It was suggested that PCOS, fertility therapy, gestational diabetes, and age at first pregnancy were not related to risk of heart failure, but a potential relation cannot be fully excluded as most studies were not of sufficient quality. Conflicting results were found for the associations between risk of heart failure and hysterectomy, gravidity and parity, and HRT.Although some reproductive factors were considered risk factors for heart failure in women, the results were mostly conflicting or inconclusive. Further research is needed to confirm and expand the current evidence on the association between reproductive factors and risk of heart failure.",

Decision aid tools (DATs) help women participate in decision-making about options. Our objective is to identify and evaluate the content and development of DATs for managing menopause, with a special focus on surgical menopause.We systematically searched electronic databases, including MEDLINE and EMBASE, from inception to March 2017 for relevant records. The principal inclusion criterion was that papers reported studies on DATs for managing menopause. Search terms were derived from two concepts: menopause and DATs. Data extracted were presented in written evidence tables and narrative summaries.Our search yielded 18,801 records. Of these, 26 records met our inclusion criteria, which gave rise to 12 DATs from peer-reviewed literature and 6 from grey literature. Seventeen DATs were focused on natural menopause and two targeted surgical menopause, both identified from grey literature. More than half were published before the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) publication and 70% before the release of the International Patient Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS). Very few studies reported the full development of the DAT involved, and less than half of DATs were informed by a needs assessment to identify the decisional needs of their target population. Most DATs focused on hormone therapy as a treatment option and did not provide a comprehensive overview of other options. None of the DATs reported the steps involved in finding, appraising and summarizing scientific content of the tool.This review highlights several limitations in the content and development of DATs for managing menopause. No peer-reviewed DATs were identified for surgical menopause. A need for a complete, evidence-based DAT in the context of surgical menopause is identified.",

We have launched a large prospective study, the \u2018Fracture Risk Brussels Epidemiological Enquiry\u2019 (FRISBEE), to develop a new predictive model for osteoporotic fractures. The aims of this report are to describe the methodology of the FRISBEE study and to compare the distribution of CRFs in our cohort with those reported in other large studies.FRISBEE is a new study that prospectively evaluates a cohort of 3560 post-menopausal women (aged 60\u201385 years) followed yearly for the occurrence of fragility fractures. Multiple validated CRFs, densitometry (DXA) values and intake of medication were systematically registered at baseline. The distribution of the FRISBEE CRFs has been compared with the distributions of CRFs in the cohorts used to develop the FRAX\u00ae model as well as in more recent cohorts. For these recent cohorts, we focused on CRFs not included in FRAX\u00ae.The most frequently encountered CRFs used in FRAX\u00ae were a prior fragility fracture (27.1%) and a parental history of hip fracture (13.4%). The prevalence of some CRFs not integrated in FRAX\u00ae was relatively high, such as the use of proton pump inhibitors (20.8%) and a history of fall(s) (19.7%). The prevalence of many CRFs was quite variable between cohorts; for example, the prevalence of \u2018personal prior fragility fracture\u2019 ranged from 9% to 51%.We found considerable heterogeneity in the prevalence of CRFs between cohort studies. The impact of these differences on the predictive value of a particular CRF is unknown. We will construct a predictive model calibrated to the Belgian population. More importantly, the FRISBEE study should allow us to determine the predictive value of newly recognized CRFs in addition to the FRAX\u00ae algorithm to reliably estimate fracture risk.",

Study design/Main outcome measures: The ATTICA study is a population-based, health and nutrition prospective cohort study (2002\u20132012), during which 853 middle-aged participants without a history of CVD [453 men (aged 45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0years) and 400 women (aged 44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0years)], underwent psychological evaluations at enrollment. The latent trait of depression and anxiety combined measure was estimated and referred as \u201cPsychological distress\u201d; path analysis was applied to describe the relationships among the different factors.\u201cPsychological distress\u201d was positively associated with the 10-year CVD incidence (adjusted OR per 10 units: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7). Three linking pathways were revealed: sedentariness, inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Moreover, \u201cPsychological distress\u201d mediated the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and CVD, with participants of low SES scoring higher on the psychological measure (adjusted linear regression coefficient b: \u22127.1, 95% CI: \u22129.7, \u22124.5).Lifestyle and clinical factors seem to link psychological distress with CVD development. Joint psychological assessments should be considered for inclusion in CVD preventive strategies, which should incorporate interventions for interrupting the linking pathways.",

Proneurotensin 1-117 (pro-NT) and prorelaxin 2 connecting peptide (pro-RLX2) have recently emerged as potential biomarkers for CVD risk in women. We assessed pro-NT and pro-RLX2 levels in women with and without a history of preeclampsia.339 women with a history of early-onset preeclampsia and 327 women with an uncomplicated pregnancy underwent cardiovascular screening 10 years after delivery (the Preeclampsia Risk EValuation in FEMales (PREVFEM) cohort).Pro-NT, a stable fragment of the neurotensin precursor, was assessed in the whole cohort. Pro-RLX2, the stable connecting peptide of the relaxin 2 prohormone, was assessed in a subset of this cohort, consisting of 27 women with a history of preeclampsia and 23 healthy controls. Associations between biomarker levels and traditional CVD risk factors in the preeclampsia and control group were assessed by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient.We found no differences in pro-NT and pro-RLX2 levels between the preeclampsia and control group. Pro-NT levels were associated with higher HbA1c levels (r\u202f=\u202f0.113, p-value 0.045) and with BMI (r\u202f=\u202f0.124, p-value 0.027), but only in the control group.

The gastrointestinal side-effects of chemotherapy often lead to dose reduction or even discontinuation of treatment, which in turn affects the clinical outcome. Gastrointestinal side-effects, such as chemotherapy-induced diarrhea and constipation, may persist many years after treatment, greatly reducing quality of life. Current treatments for these side-effects have many adverse effects themselves; therefore, new approaches are needed to address this problem. Changes in the enteric nervous system located within the gastrointestinal tract and controlling its functions have been implicated in many disorders.

Despite decades of medical research, less than 30% of cases with a suggestive personal and/or family history of hereditary breast cancer have an identified causative gene mutation.The vast majority of these cases are due to a mutation in one of the highly penetrant breast cancer genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, PTEN, TP53, CDH1, and STK11) and various guidelines direct the management of these patients. A minority of cases are due to mutations in moderate-penetrance genes (PALB2, ATM, BRIP1, and CHEK2).A small number of low-penetrance alleles have been identified using advanced genetic testing methods. While these may contribute to risk in a polygenic fashion, this is likely to be relevant to a minority of cases and their identification should not be considered routine practice. Mutation testing currently requires a high index of suspicion for a specific contributing etiology, but next-generation sequencing may improve the identification of such genes and the clinical management of these cases.Where no genetic susceptibility is identified, lifetime breast cancer risk can be calculated with standard tools. Breast cancer risk management then depends on the calculated lifetime risk. The psychological consequences of such screening for mutation carriers and non-carriers are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Although some risk factors for breast cancer might be protective for osteoporosis, several cross-sectional studies have reported, nevertheless, that patients with breast cancer have a lower bone mass and potentially a higher incidence of fractures than expected. In any case, it appears that patients with breast cancer are not protected from osteoporosis, which provides further support for the recommendation that bone health is assessed after a diagnosis of breast cancer. Most adjuvant therapies will lead to increased bone loss and a higher fracture rate. Among the adjuvant therapy options for premenopausal patients with breast cancer, endocrine therapy (ovarian suppression) and chemotherapy can result in cancer treatment-induced bone loss (CTIBL) of up to 10% at the lumbar spine after one year. Antiresorptive therapies prevent CTIBL in premenopausal women with breast cancer. Most of the evidence demonstrating the efficacy of bisphosphonates in the prevention of CTIBL is derived from clinical trials with zoledronic acid. The addition of zoledronic acid 4\u00a0mg per six months to adjuvant endocrine therapy maintained and even increased bone mass during a 3-year treatment period and significantly improved disease-free survival in a population of young women who underwent menopause due to the adjuvant treatment. The major contributor to bone loss in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer in postmenopausal women is the use of aromatase inhibitors (AIs). Oncology trials have underestimated the fracture risk in the setting of AI-induced bone loss. In the ABCSG-18 study, the only trial in which fracture incidence was the primary endpoint, the rate of clinical fractures was close to 10% after 3 years in the placebo group on AIs only. Bisphosphonates and denosumab at osteoporosis treatment doses can counteract AI-induced bone loss. In the ABCSG-18 trial, treatment with denosumab 60\u00a0mg injection every 6 months reduced the risk of first clinical fracture relative to placebo by 50%. Current guidelines recommend antiresorptive therapy in patients with a baseline T score of <\u22122.0 or with two or more clinical risk factors for fracture. These recent guidelines will need to be updated, as similar significant protective effects were seen in women with either normal or low bone mass. Moreover, a formal meta-analysis of individual patient data from more than 18,000 women in 26 randomized trials of adjuvant zoledronic acid or clodronate treatment for early breast cancer revealed that bisphosphonates significantly reduced the risk of first distant recurrence in bone and the risk of breast cancer mortality, at least in postmenopausal women. Even though the increased risk of fracture during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer in postmenopausal women is notable, an enhanced risk of fracture in long-term survivors of breast cancer remains under debate. The most recent studies suggest that Caucasian breast cancer survivors do not have a significantly increased risk of osteoporotic fracture over the long term.",

Data were collected using a mailed survey and the medical record. Validated questionnaires were used to generate rates of urinary incontinence and other pelvic floor disorders. The incidence rates of pelvic floor disorders were compared across groups with different exposures to radiation.Of the 149 endometrial cancer survivors, 41% received radiation therapy. Fifty-one percent of women reported urine leakage. The rates of urinary incontinence in women exposed and not exposed to vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) or whole-pelvis radiation were 48% and 58%, respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.47). The incidence of fecal incontinence did not differ between groups, but the score for overall sexual function was significantly higher in women who did not undergo radiation therapy. On multivariable analysis, significant risk factors for urinary incontinence were age (AOR 1.06 95% CI 1.02, 1.10) and BMI (AOR 1.07 95% CI 1.02, 1.11), but treatment with radiation was not significantly associated with urinary incontinence, or fecal incontinence (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Age, BMI, and radiation exposure were independent predictors of decreased sexual function score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).Local or regional radiation is not associated with urinary or fecal incontinence, but may contribute to sexual dysfunction in endometrial cancer survivors.",

Responses were compared between those who were sexually active and those who were not.Of 316 partnered women who reported sexual activity status, most were breast cancer survivors (n\u00a0=\u00a0268, 85%) and were sexually active (n\u00a0=\u00a0227, 72%). Women who were not sexually active (n\u00a0=\u00a089, 28%) were slightly older than those who were active (53.1\u00a0v 51.0 years, p\u00a0=\u00a00.049) but did not differ in menopausal status, time since cancer diagnosis, or treatment with chemotherapy, anti-estrogenic endocrine therapy or menopausal hormone therapy. Loss of interest in sex (78%) and being too tired (44%) were the most common reasons for sexual inactivity. Those who were not sexually active were more likely to be dissatisfied with their sex lives (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.52, 95% CI 1.66\u20137.48) and to have lost interest in sex (aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.22\u20133.67).

Sexually inactive women were more dissatisfied with their sex lives, felt less attractive and more self-conscious about their appearance. The reasons for sexual inactivity in cancer survivors are multifaceted and complex and rates of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia did not differ between sexually active and inactive women, suggesting that interventions to improve sexual function which are limited to treating vaginal dryness are unlikely to be effective.",

Its use is associated with severe gastrointestinal (GI) side-effects, associated with oxidative damage and neurotoxicity to the enteric neurons. Resveratrol is a potent anti-oxidant that has been shown to protect against oxidative damage and neurotoxicity in other neurons and could therefore prevent oxaliplatin-induced damage to enteric neurons. We determined whether co-administration of resveratrol with oxaliplatin alleviates enteric neuron toxicity and GI dysfunction in mice. Colons were collected for immunohistochemical analysis of myenteric neurons and assessment of motor activity in organ-bath experiments. Morphological damage to the colonic mucosa and muscles was analysed. Oxaliplatin treatment induced translocation of nitrated proteins into the nuclei of myenteric neurons and significant damage to the mucosal lining, vacuolisation and a decrease in muscle thickness. This damage is linked to motor dysfunction due to inhibition of the amplitude of colonic contractions, leading to chronic constipation. Co-treatment with resveratrol prevented oxaliplatin-induced neurotoxicity, alleviated damage to GI mucosa, crypts and muscle layer, resulting in improved contractility and a decrease in constipation. Resveratrol could be integrated as part of a therapeutic regimen to help alleviate oxaliplatin-induced GI dysfunction.",

Alternative life course models for psychological distress (measured through the CES-D and SAS) and stress were compared with the saturated model (i.e., the accumulative risk). The more restrictive \u201csensitive period\u201d models were the best fit for depressive symptoms though none was significantly better than another. In contrast, an \u201cearly sensitive\u201d model provided the best fit for anxiety data.Anxiety scores were higher in women with early life stressors.

Clinical and demographic data, including family history of cancer, were obtained. Blood samples were collected for genetic testing.The entire coding sequence of BRCA1 and BRCA2 was evaluated for mutations. Mutation carrier probability was calculated using BOADICEA, BRCAPRO, Myriad and the Manchester score. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were calculated for each algorithm. Logistic regression was used to detect additional factors associated with BRCA1/2 status, and these were added to the algorithms before recalculating the AUCs.BRCA1/2 mutations were identified in 19 of the 100 included patients. BOADICEA outperformed other algorithms (sensitivity, 73.7%; specificity, 87.7%; AUC, 0.87, with a threshold of a 10% risk of mutation). Later menarche was associated with the presence of a BRCA1/2 mutation. Although adding age at menarche resulted in a larger AUC for all models, this increase was significant only for the Myriad algorithm.A BOADICEA risk evaluation of 10% or more most accurately predicted BRCA1/2 status, and the inclusion of age at menarche tended to improve the performance of all algorithms. Using these tools could reduce the number of tests, but at the expense of missing a significant proportion of mutation carriers.",

The connection between MetS components and gut microflora is now acknowledged and multiple therapeutic strategies have been proposed to change the composition of the gut microbiota in order to promote optimal metabolic health. Prebiotics have the ability to favour growth of beneficial bacteria, especially short-chain fatty-acids (SCFA) producers. Increased SCFA in the gut is associated with improved satiety and weight loss, reduced systemic inflammation by increasing the gut barrier function, and improved glucose and lipid metabolism. The objective of this review is to examine the recent literature in order to determine the types and doses of prebiotics that could be recommended for the management of MetS. A review of the literature was executed using the MEDLINE database and clinical trials from 2013 to 2017 were selected for analysis. In conclusion, a daily supplementation of 10\u00a0g of inulin, resistant starches or fructo-oligosaccharide-enriched inulin could have beneficial effects on MetS components in individuals with type 2 diabetes. In healthy subjects or in individuals with the MetS, the results are too heterogeneous and scarce to be able to set any specific recommendations.

Recently, the cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxychoelsterol (27HC) has been defined as an endogenous SERM, with activities in atherosclerosis, osteoporosis, breast and prostate cancers, and neural degenerative diseases. Since 27HC concentrations closely mirror those of cholesterol, it is possible that 27HC mediates many of the biological effects of cholesterol. This paper provides an overview of ER pharmacology and summarizes the work to date implicating 27HC in various diseases. Wherever possible, we highlight clinical data in support of a role for 27HC in the diseases discussed.",

     "abstract": "While it is known that estrogen protects heart health in women prior to menopause, its role after menopause and during the menopause transition is far less apparent. Previous reviews summarizing the literature on the impact of endogenous estrogen on risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) have focused on postmenopausal women and have not come to a clear conclusion. No previous review has summarized the associations between follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), a proxy measure of the menopause transition, and CVD risk. The main purpose of this narrative review is to highlight gaps and limitations in the literature on endogenous estrogen and FSH as related to CVD risk. Future directions are addressed in light of recent findings in the field. When studying the relationship of estrogen to cardiovascular risk, it is critical to separate endogenously produced estrogen from exogenously administered estrogen. Moreover, other reproductive hormones such as FSH should be assessed, since growing evidence suggests a potential contribution of this hormone. Evaluation of estrogen changes over time allows a separation of women based on their hormone trajectories. These individual trajectories correlate with subclinical CVD and thus indicate that it is much more important to observe a woman over time rather than ascribe risk to a single determination at a single time point. As women progress through menopause and the ovary stops producing estradiol, the nature of the relationship between estrogens and subclinical CVD markers also appears to undergo a switch. Studies are needed to examine the midlife course of endogenous estradiol, FSH and CVD risk. These studies should also consider other hormones, including androgens, with an eye towards helping women modify their cardiovascular risk in midlife, when prevention is most likely possible.",

Concerning women, both high and low levels of endogenous androgens have been associated with cardiovascular disease, while other studies have reported no association. Adiposity, impaired glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia and estrogen levels may mediate the observed associations. Regarding testosterone therapy in women, there have been no large prospective studies on cardiovascular outcomes. Concerning men, most studies indicate that low levels of circulating testosterone are associated with increased rates of cardiovascular disease in the general population; the causality, however, of this association remains to be proven.

There is little information on its long-term effects on microvascular complications as clinical trials have not been long enough and neither have they focused on these factors.Overall management includes awareness of a drug\u2019s diabetogenic potential, underlying diabetes risk, benefits and risks of continuing vs discontinuing the drug, plus a consideration of drug duration and dose. While diabetes and its severity can be identified and controlled, the likelihood of future diabetes complications frequently cannot. This, balanced against the predicted benefit of the drug, results in clinical uncertainty.Empirical approaches to drug-related hyperglycemia include decreasing the dose or selecting an alternative treatment, if possible. In the absence of drug-specific evidence, treatment of drug-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes is similar to comprehensive standard diabetes care, including lifestyle modifications, oral/injectable antidiabetic agents and insulin. Important clinical considerations include surveillance of glucose before and during treatment and, in some cases, institution of diabetes preventive measures like lifestyle modification and early treatment. Future research is needed to elucidate pathophysiology and optimal targeted treatment for drug-induced diabetes and its long-term complications.",

     "abstract": "Similar to their US counterparts, Costa Rican women enter menopause at \u223c50 years of age, have similar symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats, as well as an overall negative attitude toward the menopausal transition. One study of rural women in Monteverde reported that women knew little about the menopausal transition, as the subject was not discussed. Similar to other Latin American women, the use of hormone therapy by Costa Rican women is low and instead they use alternative therapies, including massage, dietary changes and herbal medicines. A wide variety of herbal therapies are used, and some of these herbs have estrogenic activities in vitro. However, clinical data on the safety and efficacy of any of these treatments is lacking. Recently, a disturbing increase in the incidence of human papilloma virus infections in menopausal women has been reported, due in part to more sexual freedom after menopause. Fortunately, the strain of HPV infecting these women is not associated with cervical cancer. Overall, there is a significant lack of scientific and medical research on menopausal women in Costa Rica. Considering the aging population, the high use of herbal medicines by menopausal women and the lack of clinical studies on these treatments, future research should focus on gaining a better understanding of menopause in this population. Furthermore, new educational programs for these women and the health professionals who serve them are necessary, as well as investigations of the safety and efficacy of the herbal supplements women use to manage their menopausal symptoms.",

We reviewed the data on the association between AAM and different subtypes of CVD, and used shared genetic loci to identify possible mechanisms underlying this association using shared genetic association. We searched the databases of PubMed, Web of Science and Embase through to April 2017. We included articles with any clinically manifest CVD endpoint and for any ethnicity. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for AAM in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Caucasians through PubMed and HuGE Navigator, and searched whether these SNPs or any of their proxies were associated with any CVD-related trait. Eight studies in Caucasian populations reported an inverse linear relation between AAM and CVD risk, whereas one large study reported a significant U-shaped relation between them. Data from Asian populations were contradictory and inconclusive. In total, 122 AAM SNPs were identified at a genome-wide significance level (p\u00a0<\u00a05\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128). Of those, 18 were also associated with various CVD-related traits, primarily body mass index (BMI), obesity, and height. In conclusion, early AAM and possibly also late AAM increase the risk of CVD in Caucasian populations. Weight and height may be part of the mechanism underlying the relation between AAM and CVD risk in Caucasians. Data on other ethnicities are too limited for meaningful analysis and conclusions.",

It is important to identify factors limiting functionality in this population in order to reduce costs and improve both prevention and intervention. Handgrip strength (HGS) is a biomarker of aging associated with several adverse health outcomes, but long-term associations with disability in older patients with LBP are not known.To examine whether HGS predicts disability in older women with acute low back pain (LBP).Longitudinal analyses were conducted with a sample of 135 older women from the international multicenter study Back Complaints in the Elders (BACE-Brazil). Women aged 60 years and over with a new episode of acute LBP were included. HGS was assessed with Jamar\u00ae dynamometer, and disability was assessed using the Roland Morris questionnaire and gait speed test. Variables were assessed at baseline and at 12-month follow-up. Linear regression models explored associations between HGS and disability measures.Significant association was found between HGS at baseline and gait speed at 12-month follow-up (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.24; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). A multivariable-adjusted model showed that this association was independent of age, body mass index, and pain intensity (adjusted R2\u00a0=\u00a00.13; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A final prediction model showed an incremental difference of only 2.1% in gait speed after inclusion of HGS as an independent variable. No association was found between HGS and score on the Roland Morris questionnaire.Caution is needed regarding the use of HGS as a predictive measure of disability in older women with acute LBP. Changes in gait speed were very small and unlikely to be of clinical relevance.",

With these confounding variables, we observed that products of lipid peroxidation were closely associated with sarcopenia in independent older adults (frail participants and those with severe dependence had been excluded from the sample). The best multivariate model proposed was able to predict 67.6% of the variance in sarcopenia, with a power of discrimination of 93.5%. Additional analyses considering lipid levels, fat mass, dyslipidemia, use of lipid-lowering drugs and hypertension confirmed this close association between lipid peroxidation and sarcopenia.Given the difficulty in the diagnosis of sarcopenia in clinical practice, we suggest the use of blood circulating products of lipid peroxidation as potential biomarkers for an early diagnosis of sarcopenia in independent older adults.",

     "abstract": "Low levels of gonadal circulating estrogen observed in post-menopausal women can adversely impact a diverse range of physiological factors, with clinical implications for brain cognition, gut health, the female reproductive tract and other aspects of women\u2019s health. One of the principal regulators of circulating estrogens is the gut microbiome. This review aims to shed light on the role of the gut microbiota in estrogen-modulated disease. The gut microbiota regulates estrogens through secretion of \u03b2-glucuronidase, an enzyme that deconjugates estrogens into their active forms. When this process is impaired through dysbiosis of gut microbiota, characterized by lower microbial diversity, the decrease in deconjugation results in a reduction of circulating estrogens. The alteration in circulating estrogens may contribute to the development of conditions discussed herein: obesity, metabolic syndrome, cancer, endometrial hyperplasia, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, fertility, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cognitive function. The bi-directional relationship between the metabolic profile (including estrogen levels) and gut microbiota in estrogen-driven disease will also be discussed. Promising therapeutic interventions manipulating the gut microbiome and the metabolic profile of estrogen-driven disease, such as bariatric surgery and metformin, will be detailed. Modulation of the microbiome composition subsequently impacts the metabolic profile, and vice versa, and has been shown to alleviate many of the estrogen-modulated disease states. Last, we highlight promising research interventions in the field, such as dietary therapeutics, and discuss areas that provide exciting unexplored topics of study.",

     "abstract": "Combined advances in modern medical practice and increased human longevity are driving an ever-expanding elderly population. Females are particularly at risk of age-associated pathology, spending more of their lives in a post-menopausal state. Menopause, denoted by a rapid decline in serum sex steroid levels, accelerates biological ageing across the body\u2019s tissues. Post-menopause physiological changes are particularly noticeable in the skin, which loses structural architecture and becomes prone to damage. The sex steroid most widely discussed as an intrinsic contributor to skin ageing and pathological healing is 17\u03b2-estradiol (or estrogen), although many others are involved. Estrogen deficiency is detrimental to many wound-healing processes, notably inflammation and re-granulation, while exogenous estrogen treatment widely reverses these effects. Over recent decades, many of the molecular and cellular correlates to estrogen\u2019s beneficial effect on normal skin homeostasis and wound healing have been reported. However, disparities still exist, particularly in the context of mechanistic studies investigating estrogen receptor signalling and its potential cellular effects. New molecular techniques, coupled with increased understanding of estrogen in skin biology, will provide further opportunities to develop estrogen receptor-targeted therapeutics.",

All GSM symptoms (dryness/dyspareunia/itching/burning/dysuria/urgency/frequency) and UI decreased significantly and consistently in all available publications. The pooled mean differences for the various symptoms were: dryness \u22125.5(95%CI:\u22126.7,\u22124.4;7studies;I2:0%), dyspareunia \u22125.6(95%CI:\u22126.8,\u22124.5;7 studies;I2:0%), itching \u22124(95%CI:\u22125.7,\u22122.2;6 studies;I2:79%), burning \u22123.9(95%CI:\u22125.9,\u22122;6 studies;I2:87%), dysuria \u22122.9(95%CI:\u22125.1,\u22120.7;4 studies;I2:90%) and UI \u22124.9(95%CI:\u22126.4,\u22123.4;2 studies;I2:0%).

Thus, we examined the associations of serum ferritin with insulin resistance and MetS in postmenopausal women.A nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted to examine the relationship between serum ferritin and IR and MetS in 2734 postmenopausal women using data from the 2010\u20132012 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR\u00a0\u2265\u00a075th percentile, 3.04) and MetS were calculated using multiple logistic regression analyses across serum ferritin quartiles (Q1,\u00a0\u2264\u00a036.25; Q2, 36.56\u201356.56; Q3, 56.57\u201385.98; and Q4\u00a0\u2265\u00a085.99\u00a0ng/ml).The mean values of most cardiometabolic variables tended to increase proportionally with serum ferritin quartiles. The proportion of women with IR and MetS significantly increased in accordance with serum ferritin quartiles. Compared to individuals in the lowest quartile, the ORs (95% CIs) in the highest quartile were 2.06 (1.23\u20133.45) for IR and 1.92 (1.44\u20132.55) for MetS after adjusting for age, cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and regular exercise.Serum ferritin levels were positively and independently associated with IR and MetS in postmenopausal women. These findings suggest that serum ferritin level in postmenopausal women may help to identify the presence of IR and MetS.",

     "abstract": "To externally validate the previously identified effect on breast cancer risk of the Western, Prudent and Mediterranean dietary patterns.MCC-Spain is a multicase-control study that collected epidemiological information on 1181 incident cases of female breast cancer and 1682 healthy controls from 10 Spanish provinces. Three dietary patterns derived in another Spanish case-control study were analysed in the MCC-Spain study. These patterns were termed Western (high intakes of fatty and sugary products and red and processed meat), Prudent (high intakes of low-fat dairy products, vegetables, fruits, whole grains and juices) and Mediterranean (high intake of fish, vegetables, legumes, boiled potatoes, fruits, olives, and vegetable oil, and a low intake of juices). Their association with breast cancer was assessed using logistic regression models with random province-specific intercepts considering an interaction with menopausal status. Risk according to tumour subtypes \u2013 based on oestrogen (ER), progesterone (PR) and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptors (ER+/PR+ & HER2\u2212; HER2+; ER\u2212/PR\u2212 & HER2\u2212) \u2013 was evaluated with multinomial regression models.Breast cancer and histological subtype.Our results confirm most of the associations found in the previous case-control study. A high adherence to the Western dietary pattern seems to increase breast cancer risk in both premenopausal women (OR4thvs.1stquartile (95% CI):1.68 (1.02;2.79); OR1SD-increase (95% CI):1.19 (1.02;1.40)) and postmenopausal women (OR4thvs.1stquartile(95% CI):1.48(1.07;2.05); OR1SD-increase(95% CI): 1.14 (1.01;1.29)). While high adherence to the Prudent pattern did not show any effect on breast cancer, the Mediterranean dietary pattern seemed to be protective, but only among postmenopausal women (OR4thvs.1stquartile (95% CI): 0.72 (95% CI 0.53;0.98); p-int\u00a0=\u00a00.075). There were no significant differences by tumour subtype.Dietary recommendations based on a departure from the Western dietary pattern in favour of the Mediterranean diet could reduce breast cancer risk in the general population.",

Standardised monthly rates of bed days and LOS were calculated, between April 2011 and March 2015, for residents of Glasgow City aged 65 years and over. Multilevel negative binomial models for the square root of each outcome nested by datazone were created, adjusting for sex, 5-year age group, area-level deprivation, season, month and month squared. Relative index of inequality (RII) and slope index of inequality (SII) were calculated for each year and the trend was examined.The rate of bed days first rose then fell during the study period, while LOS first fell then rose. Relative risk (RR) of an additional bed day was greater for males (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.14 (1.12, 1.16)) and increased with increasing age group. There was no gender difference in LOS. Bed days per head of population first increased then fell; for 12-month period RR\u00a0=\u00a01.01 (0.98, 1.05) and for 12-month period squared, RR\u00a0=\u00a00.999 (0.999, 0.999). RII and SII for rate of bed days per head of population were significant, though not for LOS. SII for bed days per head of population did not change significantly over time, while RII reduced at the 87% level of confidence.The results suggest a reduction in secondary care use by older people during the RCOP programme, and a possible reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in bed days in the longer term.",

Anxiety and depression were ascertained using the Hospital Anxiety and Depressive Scale. Models were adjusted for age, clinical measures of obesity and mobility, and self-reported lifestyles, with adjustment made for anxiety and depression.Associations were observed between low mobility and lower psychological-related QOL (OR 0.70, 95%CI 0.53\u20130.93), and for smoking and low mobility with lower environment-related QOL (OR 0.48, 95%CI 0.27\u20130.84; OR 0.67, 95%CI 0.50\u20130.90, respectively). Age, anxiety and depression were independently associated with QOL in each domain.Independent of age, anxiety and depression, smoking and low mobility showed particularly strong effects on the likelihood of men reporting a lower satisfaction with their QOL.

The prescription rates of AOM within 3 months after hip fracture were determined and the factors affecting AOM prescriptions were identified through multivariate logistic regression.A total of 6307 elderly patients were selected from a national medical insurance database, giving an estimated 15,768 patients nationally in a nine-month period.

Dance is a popular form of physical activity among older people and previous research has suggested that it may improve various health outcomes in this population, including balance, gait and muscle performance. A systematic review of the potential benefits of dance on falls and fear of falling is lacking. Thus, we conducted a systematic review considering all randomized controls trials (RCTs) investigating if dance can reduce falls and improve fear of falling in older adults. Major databases were searched from inception until 1 March 2017 and a total of 10 RCTs were identified, which included a total of 680 people (n\u00a0=\u00a0356 dance, n\u00a0=\u00a0324 control). Overall, the mean age of the samples was 69.4 years, and 75.2% were female. Across four RCTs, dance therapy reduced falls versus usual care in only one study. Dance therapy improved fear of falling in two out of three included RCTs. There were no serious adverse events reported in the RCTs. In summary, we found a paucity of studies investigating the effect of dance on falls and fear of falling and the evidence base is preliminary and equivocal. Given the heterogeneity of the included samples and interventions, in addition to the short-term follow-up, no firm conclusions can be drawn. However, dance appears to be safe and, given its popularity and demonstrated benefits on other health/wellbeing outcomes in older adults, it is important that future research considers its potential benefits on falls/fear of falling in older age.",

We stratified patients by vitamin D status into three groups according to serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level: sufficient (\u226530\u00a0ng/mL, n\u00a0=\u00a025), insufficient (10-\u00a0<\u00a030\u00a0ng/mL, n\u00a0=\u00a0516), and deficient (\u00a0<\u00a010\u00a0ng/mL, n\u00a0=\u00a0110). To measure endothelial dysfunction, ADMA concentration was assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The association between 25(OH)D status and ADMA concentration was analyzed by multiple linear regression models.The mean ADMA concentration was significantly higher in the insufficient 25(OH)D group (0.665\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and the deficient 25(OH)D group (0.734\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared with the sufficient 25(OH)D group (0.589\u00a0\u03bcmol/L).

     "abstract": "During menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) a possible increase in breast cancer risk is thought to depend mainly on the progestogen component. In vitro studies have shown that the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1) is important for tumor proliferation induced by progestogens. The primary aim of this study was to compare for the first time the natural progestogen, progesterone (P), with a synthetic progestogen, norethisterone (NET), using a xenograft model.MCF7 cells, transfected with PGRMC1 plasmid or empty vector, were injected into nude mice and estradiol (E2) pellets were implanted. After 12\u00a0days, NET or P or placebo pellets were implanted. Tumor volumes in all groups (6 mice/group) were monitored for 6\u20137 weeks. Immunohistochemical expression of PGRMC1 and KI-67 was assessed. These experiments were repeated using T47D cells.Compared with the control condition, E2 and sequential E2/NET combination increased xenograft tumor growth with MCF7 and T47D cells that transgenically expressed PGRMC1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01); progesterone did not increase growth. Breast cancer cells transfected with empty vectors did not respond to either progestogen. Comparing KI-67 and PGRMC1 expression, the Pearson correlation was r\u00a0=\u00a00.848, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002.E2 plus NET increases tumor growth in human breast cancer cells overexpressing PGRMC1, but there is no change with progesterone. To our knowledge, this is the first comparison of both progestogens in vivo using nude mice, which are frequently used in xenograft models. Clinical trials are needed to determine whether women with overexpression of PGRMC1 are at increased risk of breast cancer if NET instead of progesterone is used in MHT.",

For mental HRQOL, a weaker association was found (OR 1.41 95% CI 1.02, 1.95, fully adjusted, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).This paper provides evidence for the cumulative health impact of stressful life events, both those that are perpetrated against an individual (violence) and those undertaken with a degree of personal agency (caregiving).

The analysis included 2967 postmenopausal women under 70 years of age, and there were no missing data. Questionnaire responses regarding MHT, current life habits, reproductive history, and rhinitis were reviewed. The levels of total immunoglobulin E (IgE) and specific IgE for Dermatophagoides farinae, cockroaches, and dogs were measured, using approximately 10% of all samples. We compared women who were users of MHT and non-users of MHT. We also compared women with and without chronic rhinitis.Of 2967 women matching the study criteria, 567 were MHT users. The proportion of general rhinitis symptoms was greater among MHT users (24.5%) than among MHT non-users (18.9%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). The proportion of cases of rhinorrhea or posterior nasal drip was also greater among MHT users (6.3% vs. 4.3%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.042), while there were no differences between the two groups in the proportion of cases of nasal obstruction. There were no differences in total IgE and specific IgE levels between the two groups. MHT was used by 23.4% of women with chronic rhinitis and 18.0% of women without chronic rhinitis. Age, waist circumference, and body mass index were also greater among women without chronic rhinitis than among those with chronic rhinitis.MHT may cause non-allergic rhinitis in postmenopausal women.

Current objective measurements of vaginal atrophy such as maturation index require vaginal swabs and are invasive; at present, no minimally invasive measurements exist. The purpose of this study was to assess whether total vaginal wall thickness (TVT) and total vaginal mucosa thickness (TMT) as measured by transabdominal ultrasound could qualify as additional objective markers of vaginal wall thinning which could be related to menopausal status.Women presenting for pelvic ultrasound had a transabdominal ultrasound scan performed to measure TVT and TMT at the level of the bladder trigone. In addition, a transvaginal endometrial lining thickness was measured.The ultrasound measurement data from 76 participants showed that there was a significant difference in the mean value for TVT and endometrial lining between pre- and post-menopausal women. The same difference in mean was not observed for TMT.TVT may be a reliable measure of vaginal thinning, which worsens with estrogen decline. These preliminary data also suggest that TMT does not have the same correlation as the TVT measurement. A larger sample is needed to further assess the usefulness and sensitivity of these measures and whether there is clinical and/or research usefulness in obtaining vaginal wall measurements by transabdominal ultrasound.",

     "abstract": "Anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), a quantitative marker of ovarian reserve, is used for both clinical and research purposes in the field of reproductive medicine. Numerous AMH assays have been developed. Among other factors, the lack of large-scale comparisons of the various assays hinders the universal interpretation of AMH levels. Moreover, little is known of the practical performance of highly sensitive assays compared with conventional assays with regard to the very low AMH levels found in women nearing menopause. This study aimed to compare the measurements of the Gen II (Beckman Coulter) assay with those of the highly sensitive picoAMH (AnshLabs) assay.This cross-sectional study included 1985 premenopausal women who completed the second visit of the population-based Doetinchem Cohort Study, with a mean age of 42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0years. AMH levels were measured with the Gen II and picoAMH assays. Passing-Bablok and Bland Altman analyses were performed and differences in the proportion of detectable samples were assessed.The results from the Gen II and picoAMH assays were highly correlated, with a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.91. The Passing-Bablok regression formula was picoAMH\u00a0=\u00a00.01\u00a0+\u00a01.69\u00a0*\u00a0GenII, meaning that on average picoAMH levels were 69% higher than Gen II levels. Of the 670 samples with an undetectable AMH value with the Gen II assay, AMH could be detected in 78% with the picoAMH assay, at a median concentration [interquartile range] of 0.05 [0.01\u20130.14] ng/mL.These results indicate that, despite a high correlation, there is a large relative difference between results of the Gen II and picoAMH assays. The use of a highly sensitive AMH assay is likely to result in a large increase in the proportion of samples with detectable levels. This may enable research into women\u2019s health across the menopausal transition and research into the potential clinical benefits of distinguishing between women with very low ovarian reserve.",

Three open-ended questions asked peri- and post-menopausal women, aged 45\u201365 years: (i) what they thought employers could do, or should do, to help menopausal women who may be experiencing difficult menopausal symptoms at work; (ii) how managers should behave; and (iii) how managers should not behave towards women going through the menopause.137 women responded to the open questions in the survey. An inductive thematic analysis was conducted and three overarching themes emerged. Theme 1 related to employer/manager awareness, specifically to knowledge about the menopause and awareness of how the physical work environment might impact on menopausal women.

Theme 3 described employer actions, involving staff training and raising awareness, and supportive policies such as those relating to sickness absence and flexible working hours.The menopause can be difficult for some women to deal with at work, partly due to the working environment. To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore women\u2019s descriptions of how they would like to be treated by employers/managers, and what would be helpful and unhelpful. The results have clear implications for communication about menopause at work and for employer-level policy and practice.",

     "abstract": "Functional deterioration and reduced mobility in elderly patients with a hip fracture are associated with a loss of both muscle mass and function (sarcopenia). The aim of this study was to assess whether oral nutritional supplementation (ONS) improves muscle mass and nutritional markers (BMI, proteins) in elderly patients with hip fracture.Patients aged 65 years and over with hip fractures admitted to either of two rehabilitation facilities were included. Patients with diabetes, with Barthel index scores <40 prior to the fracture or with pathological fractures were excluded. A random-numbers generator was used to randomly allocate patients to the intervention group (IG) or the control group (CG). Those in the IG received a standard diet plus ONS in the form of two bottles a day of \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylbutyrate (HMB), while those in the CG received a standard diet only. The intervention was not blinded.In order to assess changes in body mass index (BMI), anthropometric parameters were recorded at both admission and discharge. Patients\u2019 functional situation was evaluated using the Barthel index (BI) and the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC) score. Muscle mass was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis, which allowed us to calculate appendicular lean mass (aLM). The outcome variable was the difference between aLM upon discharge, minus aLM upon admission (\u0394-aLM).Of the 107 randomised patients (IG n55, CG n52), 49 finished the study in the IG and 43 in the CG. BMI and aLM were stable in IG patients, whilst these parametres decreased in the CG. A significant difference was observed between the two groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, and p\u00a0=\u00a00.020 respectively). The predictive factors for \u0394-aLM were ONS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), FAC prior to fracture (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and BI prior to fracture (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007).The concentration of proteins (p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and vitamin D (p.001) had increased more in the IG than in the CG.A diet enriched in HMB improves muscle mass, prevents the onset of sarcopenia and is associated with functional improvement in elderly patients with hip fractures. Orally administered nutritional supplements can help to prevent the onset of sarcopenic obesity.Trial registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01404195, registered 22 July 2011, HYPERPROT-GER Study.",

New onset of asthma was defined as newly reported doctor-diagnosed asthma which occurred at least one year after menarche. Asthma incidence and its association with early menarche was analysed using logistic regression, adjusting for age, atopy, smoking, BMI, parental asthma, urbanity, education and study area, and additionally stratifying by atopy and BMI.After adjustment of relevant confounders, women with early menarche did not have a significantly higher risk of onset of asthma than women without early menarche (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.85\u20131.80). Young atopic women with early menarche appeared to have an increased risk of asthma compared with non-atopic women (OR 2.21, 95% CI 0.90\u20135.43); however, our results did not reach statistical significance.We could not substantiate an association of early menarche with new onset of asthma in this Swiss population-based cohort aged 18\u201360 years at baseline.

The occurrence of adverse effects, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femoral fractures (AFF), has raised the issue of bisphosphonate or denosumab discontinuation (\u201cdrug holiday\u201d) after a certain treatment period.To assess the effect of bisphosphonate and denosumab discontinuation on fracture risk, as well as its possible benefits in reducing the risk of adverse effects.Systematic review and consensus of expert opinion.Discontinuation of bisphosphonates should be considered in all patients who have been treated for more than five years with alendronate, risedronate or zoledronic acid. In view of the limited evidence, no robust recommendations can be made for ibandronate and denosumab. If the patient has not experienced fractures before or during therapy and the fracture risk is low, a \u201cdrug holiday\u201d can be recommended. Although there is no solid evidence, 1\u20132 years for risedronate, 3\u20135 years for alendronate and 3\u20136 years for zoledronic acid are suggested. After this time, the patient should be reassessed. If a new fracture is experienced, or fracture risk has increased or BMD remains low (femoral neck T-score \u2264\u22122.5), anti-osteoporotic treatment should be resumed.

This has spurred a new wave of interest in this widely used drug. In this review, we present and evaluate the epidemiologic evidence of the association between the use of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the incidence and prognosis of ovarian and endometrial cancer.The evidence of a preventive effect of NSAID use on risk of ovarian or endometrial cancer is based primarily on results from observational studies and, consequently, is only suggestive. Overall, observational studies indicate modest reductions in risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer with aspirin use, whereas the results for non-aspirin NSAID use are equivocal. The strongest inverse associations have been reported for long-term consistent aspirin use, notably among subgroups of users (e.g., those with high body mass index). Few studies have evaluated the influence of NSAID use on the mortality of ovarian or endometrial cancer, and substantial heterogeneity of study characteristics and results preclude any conclusions.Additional studies of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAID use and ovarian or endometrial cancer risk and prognosis are warranted. In the present review, we discuss the importance of comprehensive exposure definitions (i.e., duration, timing, consistency and intensity/dose) and evaluation of potential effect modification according to user characteristics, with the aim of identifying women who may experience the largest benefit of aspirin or non-aspirin NSAID use on risk or prognosis of ovarian and endometrial cancer.",

The association between hypovitaminosis D and diabetes in older adults is equivocal, however. We conducted a meta-analysis investigating if hypovitaminosis D is associated with diabetes in prospective studies among older participants. Two investigators systematically searched major electronic databases, from inception until 10/07/2016. The cumulative incidence of diabetes among groups was estimated according to baseline serum 25OHD levels. Random effect models were used to assess the association between hypovitaminosis D and diabetes at follow-up. From 4268 non-duplicate hits, 9 studies were included; these followed 28,258 participants with a mean age of 67.7 years for a median of 7.7 years. Compared with higher levels of 25OHD, lower levels of 25OHD were associated with a higher risk of developing diabetes (6 studies; n\u00a0=\u00a013,563; RR\u00a0=\u00a01.31; 95% CI: 1.11\u20131.54; I2\u00a0=\u00a037%).

     "abstract": "Solutions are needed to satisfy care demands of older adults to live independently. Wearable technology (wearables) is one approach that offers a viable means for ubiquitous, sustainable and scalable monitoring of the health of older adults in habitual free-living environments. Gait has been presented as a relevant (bio)marker in ageing and pathological studies, with objective assessment achievable by inertial-based wearables. Commercial wearables have struggled to provide accurate analytics and have been limited by non-clinically oriented gait outcomes. Moreover, some research-grade wearables also fail to provide transparent functionality due to limitations in proprietary software. Innovation within this field is often sporadic, with large heterogeneity of wearable types and algorithms for gait outcomes leading to a lack of pragmatic use. This review provides a summary of the recent literature on gait assessment through the use of wearables, focusing on the need for an algorithm fusion approach to measurement, culminating in the ability to better detect and classify falls. A brief presentation of wearables in one pathological group is presented, identifying appropriate work for researchers in other cohorts to utilise. Suggestions for how this domain needs to progress are also summarised.",

     "abstract": "Whether or not an individual\u2019s drug metabolising capacity declines with advancing age is a vexing question. There is no clear evidence that drug metabolism itself (\u2018the biologically-assisted chemical alteration of the administered parent molecule\u2019) is less efficient in healthy old age than at younger ages, whereas a decreased capacity may be associated with ill-health and frailty. However, elderly individuals do show a reduced enzyme induction capability and are less able to tolerate overdoses. It appears that the majority of deleterious clinical outcomes related to drug therapy in an elderly (usually ill or frail) population may be ascribed to various anatomical and physiological age-related changes. These may affect both pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, but not necessarily drug metabolism. Information gleaned from animal studies undertaken mainly in rodents does not seem to be of relevance to humans and studies in healthy aged human populations may not highlight possible problems. However, certain circumstances may influence metabolic competence, and phenotyping rather than genotyping is of more value in identifying those susceptible to adverse drug reactions. This short review discusses the potential contributions of four factors (inflammation, circadian rhythm, gut microbes, epigenetic aspects) which may lead to alterations in drug metabolism with increasing age.",

Participants with any hearing loss at baseline had significantly higher odds of being retired by the 10-year follow-up (age-sex adjusted OR 1.82; 95% CI 1.00\u20133.30); this became marginally non-significant after adjusting for all other covariates (multivariable-adjusted OR 1.74; 95% CI 0.95\u20133.17). No associations were observed between DSI and the incidence of retirement.Sensory impairment in older adults was independently associated with the decision to retire.",

Several therapies are available to alleviate GSM symptoms, including hormonal and non-hormonal products. Both microablative fractional CO2 laser and the non-ablative vaginal Er:YAG laser (VEL) induce morphological changes in the vaginal tissues, and data from non-randomized clinical trials suggest that laser therapy can alleviate vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. VEL has been reported to improve SUI as well as vaginal prolapse. Although large randomized trials have not been reported, the evidence suggests that VEL can be offered as a safe and efficacious alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for GSM, as well as a first-line treatment for mild to moderate SUI, before surgical procedures are resorted to. Randomized studies are needed to compare laser treatments with other therapies, as well as to assess the duration of the therapeutic effects and the safety of repeated applications. Research is presently evaluating both an automated robotic probe for VEL treatments and an intraurethral probe for the treatment of severe and type III SUI.",

     "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in women, and increase in incidence after the menopause. It is important to uncover underlying abnormalities or modifiable risk factors. Several risk factors for recurrent UTIs have been identified, including the frequency of sexual intercourse, spermicide use and abnormal pelvic anatomy. In postmenopausal women UTIs often accompany the symptoms and signs of the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM). Antimicrobial prophylaxis has been demonstrated to be effective in reducing the risk of recurrent UTIs in women, but this may lead to drug resistance of both the causative microorganisms and the indigenous flora. The increasing prevalence of Escherichia coli (the most prevalent uropathogen) that is resistant to antimicrobial agents has stimulated interest in novel non-antibiotic methods for the prevention of UTIs. Evidence shows that topical estrogens normalize vaginal flora and greatly reduce the risk of UTIs. The use of intravaginal estrogens may be reasonable in postmenopausal women not taking oral estrogens. A number of other strategies have been used to prevent recurrent UTIs: probiotics, cranberry juice and d-mannose have been studied. Oral immunostimulants, vaginal vaccines and bladder instillations with hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate are newer strategies proposed to improve urinary symptoms and quality of life. This review provides an overview of UTIs\u2019 prophylaxis without antibiotics, focusing on a practical clinical approach to women with UTIs.",

In phase 2 (NCT02449902) and phase 3 REJOICE (NCT02253173) studies, TX-004HR significantly improved the proportions of vaginal superficial and parabasal cells and vaginal pH, and in the phase 3 study decreased the severity of dyspareunia, vaginal dryness, and vulvar and/or vaginal itching or irritation. In two randomized, phase 1 trials, estradiol Cmax and AUC0-24 were significantly lower with 10\u00a0\u03bcg and 25\u00a0\u03bcg TX-004HR than with the same doses of an approved vaginal estradiol tablet. A substudy (n\u00a0=\u00a072) of the REJOICE trial showed that estradiol Cavg and AUC0-24 with 4\u00a0\u03bcg and 10\u00a0\u03bcg TX-004HR were not different from placebo on days 1 and 14. While TX-004HR 25\u00a0\u03bcg was associated with higher Cavg and AUC0-24 versus placebo on days 1 and 14, these levels remained within the postmenopausal range. Estradiol day-84 values for all three doses were not different from placebo, demonstrating no estradiol accumulation. All TX-004HR doses were well tolerated and had an acceptable safety profile in all reviewed studies. The local vaginal efficacy of TX-004HR was significantly better than that of placebo, while the overall safety profile was similar to that of placebo. Negligible to very low systemic estradiol absorption was observed whether given at 4, 10, or 25\u00a0\u03bcg.

We conducted a systematic review to investigate potential interactions between OS and frailty.A systematic literature search of original reports providing data on \u2018OS and antioxidant\u2019 parameters and frailty was carried out across major electronic databases from inception until May 2016. Cross-sectional/case control and longitudinal studies reporting data on the association between frailty and anti-oxidants-OS biomarkers were considered for inclusion. Results were summarized with a synthesis based on the best evidence.From 1856 hits, 8 studies (cross-sectional/case control) were included (N\u00a0=\u00a06349; mean age of 75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0years; 56.4% females).

Six cross-sectional/case control studies demonstrated that frailty was associated with an increase in peripheral OS biomarkers, including lipoprotein phospholipase A2 (1 study), isoprostanes (2 studies), malonaldehyde (2 studies), 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine (2 studies), derivate of reactive oxygen metabolites (2 studies), oxidized glutathione/glutathione (1 study), 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (1 study), and protein carbonylation levels (1 study). In addition, preliminary evidence points to lower anti-oxidant parameters (vitamin C, E, \u03b1-tocopherol, biological anti-oxidant potential, total thiol levels) in frailty.Frailty and pre-frailty appear to be associated with higher OS and possibly lower anti-oxidant parameters. However, due to the cross-sectional design, it is not possible to disentangle the directionality of the relationships observed. Thus, future high-quality and in particular longitudinal research is required to confirm or refute these relationships and to further elucidate pathophysiological mechanisms.",

This narrative review aims to expand providers\u2019 understanding of cross-cultural approaches to treating and managing menopause by providing an overarching framework and perspective on CAM treatments. Increased provider understanding and awareness may improve not only provider-patient communication but also effectiveness of treatments. The distinction between illness (what patients suffer) and disease (what physicians treat) highlights the gap between what patients seek and doctors provide, and may help clarify why many women seek CAM at menopause. For example, CAM is often sought by women for whom biomedicine has been unsuccessful or inaccessible. We review the relevance to menopause of three CAM categories: natural products, mind\u2013body practices including meditation, and other complementary health approaches including traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Japanese Kampo. Assessing the effectiveness of CAM is challenging because of the individualized nature of illness patterns and associated treatments, which complicate the design of randomized controlled trials. Because many women seek CAM due to inefficacy of biomedical treatments, or cultural or economic marginalization, biomedical practitioners who make an effort to learn about CAM and ask patients about their CAM use or interest may dramatically improve the patient-provider relationship and rapport, as well as harnessing the \u2018meaning response\u2019 (Moerman, 2002) imbued in the clinical encounter. By working with women to integrate their CAM-related health-seeking behaviors and treatments, providers may also boost the efficacy of their own biomedical treatments.",

The changes in institutional care for older people have evolved from being a \u2018warehouse\u2019 type of environment for those too poor, too mad, too sick and too unloved, to a place where older people in need of care can spend their days in safety, in a \u2018homely\u2019 environment.

Results show that women with GDM have more saturated and less polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) in their red blood cell (RBC) membranes than normoglycemic pregnant women. Moreover, some studies reported that women with GDM have a greater energy intake from total fat and saturated FA, along with a lower energy intake from PUFA, when compared to normoglycemic pregnancies.

     "abstract": "Estetrol (E4) is a natural estrogen produced solely during human pregnancy. E4 is suitable for clinical use since it acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator. In clinical trials E4 has been seen to have little or no effect on coagulation. Hence, it is interesting to investigate whether E4 alters endothelial-dependent fibrinolysis.We studied the effects of E4 on the fibrinolytic system and whether this could influence the ability of endothelial cells to migrate. In addition, we compared the effects of E4 with those of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2).Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from healthy women. Expression of plasminogen-activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) proteins was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Endothelial cell migration was studied by razor-scrape horizontal and multiwell insert systems assays.E4 increased the expression of t-PA, u-PA and PAI-1 in HUVEC, but less so than did equimolar amounts of E2. The effects of E4 on t-PA, u-PA and PAI-1 were mediated by the induction of the early-immediate genes c-Jun and c-Fos. E4 in combination with E2 antagonized the effects induced by pregnancy-like E2 concentrations but did not impair the effects of postmenopausal-like E2 levels. We also found that the increased synthesis of PAI-1, u-PA and t-PA induced by E2 and E4 is important for horizontal and three-dimensional migration of HUVEC.These results support the hypothesis that E4 acts as an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), controlling the fibrinolytic system and endothelial cell migration.",

At the end of each month, participants\u2019 sexual function, including ED, was assessed by International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) Questionnaire and Global Efficacy Question (GEQ). Several biochemical parameters were also determined.The primary outcome measure was the change in IIEF score after 12 weeks of treatment.Complete randomization (random sorting using maximum allowable% deviation) with an equal number of patients in each sequence was used. This randomization algorithm has the restriction that unequal treatment allocation is not allowed; that is, all groups must have the same target sample size.Patients, investigational staff, and data collectors were blinded to treatment.

Orexin A (OxA) is a neuro-peptide that regulates sleep/wakefulness, food intake and metabolism. This study examined changes in plasma OxA levels during and after treatment in women from the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS).KEEPS randomized women within three years of menopause to: oral conjugated equine estrogen (o-CEE, 0.45\u00a0mg/day), transdermal 17\u03b2 estradiol (t-E2, 50\u00a0\u03bcg/day), or placebo pills and patches for four years. Plasma OxA levels were measured by enzyme immunoassays in fasting blood samples collected annually from KEEPS participants at Mayo Clinic during and three years after MHT. Changes in menopausal symptoms and plasma OxA levels were assessed for treatment differences.During treatment, OxA levels increased more in women randomized to o-CEE compared with the other groups. Women randomized to either form of MHT demonstrated smaller increases in BMI than those on placebo. Insomnia severity decreased similarly among treatment groups. However, neither changes in sleep nor changes in BMI correlated with changes in plasma OxA levels. Changes in waist circumference correlated positively with changes in plasma OxA levels three years after discontinuation of study treatments.Although OxA levels increased only in women randomized to o-CEE, these changes did not correlate with changes in sleep quality or BMI. The modest correlation of OxA levels with waist circumference once study treatments were discontinued suggests that OxA may be modulated through multiple intermediary pathways affected by metabolites of 17\u03b2-estradiol.Clinical Trial Registration for KEEPS: NCT00154180",

     "abstract": "Protein-energy malnutrition is common amongst people aged 65 years and older, has a multifactorial aetiology, and numerous negative outcomes. Domiciliary carers (non-clinical paid carers) and family carers (including family, friends and neighbours) are required to support the increasing demand for in-home assistance with activities of daily living due to the ageing population. This review provides insight into the role of both domiciliary and family carers in providing individualised nutrition support for older, community-dwelling adults with malnutrition. Four electronic databases were searched for intervention studies from database inception to December 2016. Both domiciliary and family carers are well placed to monitor the dietary intake and nutritional status of older adults; to assist with many food-related tasks such as the sourcing and preparation of meals, and assisting with feeding when necessary; and to act as a conduit between the care recipient and formal nutrition professionals such as dietitians. There is moderate evidence to support the role of domiciliary carers in implementing nutrition screening and referral pathways, and emerging evidence suggests they may have a role in malnutrition interventions when supported by health professionals. Moderate evidence also supports the engagement of family carers as part of the nutrition care team for older adults with malnutrition. Interventions such as group education, skill-development workshops and telehealth demonstrate promise and have significantly improved outcomes in older adults with dementia. Further interventional and translational research is required to demonstrate the efficacy of engaging with domiciliary and family carers of older adults in the general community.",

     "abstract": "It is now possible to detect the pathology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) many years before symptoms and signs otherwise become manifest. Biomarkers of disease include evidence of amyloid and tau in the cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging which (for instance) allows amyloid in the brain to be visualized. There is, thus, a preclinical state in which it is possible to identify Alzheimer\u2019s pathology long before there is clinical evidence of disease. Much research focuses on this preclinical state because it seems likely that treatments will be more effective before the disease is established. This means that researchers can discover Alzheimer\u2019s pathology some years before the person is at risk of developing the condition. In memory clinics, too, people may present with early (prodromal) symptoms which do not yet amount to a dementia syndrome (e.g. mild cognitive impairment), yet biomarker evidence that dementia is highly likely to develop. This is problematic because people will be required to consent to the disclosure of findings that indicate an uncertain risk of an alarming disease. We carried out a scoping review of the issues that arise in connection with a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d of preclinical dementia. We identified four themes in the literature: stigma; ethical issues; psychological burden; and language. We shall discuss these themes and related issues that emerge to do with meaning, medicalization, virtues and values. More research is now required to understand these issues in detail, where the emphasis should be on the breadth of research, which must be biopsychosocial and ethical.",

The outcome measures (OMs) used to assess PC are varied and this could limit the estimation of the effectiveness of the intervention. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the OMs currently used to assess PC in exergaming interventions, for healthy elderly individuals aged over 60 years. The literature search was conducted across five databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, PubMed, ISI, SPORTdiscus and Science Direct) using a range of search terms and combinations relating to exergaming, balance, exercise, falls and elderly. Quality assessment was conducted using the PEDro Scale and a custom-made quality assessment tool. Eleven trials were included in the meta-analysis, with a mean (SD) PEDro score of 5.36 (1.57). Primary and secondary OMs showed small effects in favour of alternative training modes, although these effects were statistically insignificant for all primary OMs. Tertiary OMs could not be included in the meta-analysis due to varying output parameters from different instruments. Heterogeneity remained high across trials and no studies performed long-term follow-up. Exergaming is a potential alternative to PC training, although still in its infancy. Strong and well-designed RCTs are needed, targeting specific populations aged over 60 years. Variability in instrumented OMs prevents generalisation of results. Technological improvements may provide data not currently available from clinical and laboratory-based methods, and may allow PC to be assessed more realistically and specifically in relation to a population\u2019s activities of daily living, though this remains a new area of research.",

Frailty was measured with a FI, which we constructed based on the accumulation of 45 health-related variables, related to mood, cognition, functional status, diseases and conditions, biomarkers, and nutritional status. A total FI-score was calculated by averaging the scores of the deficits, resulting in a score between 0 and 1, with higher scores indicating increasing frailty.

Median follow-up time was 9.5 years, during which 3902 (34%) participants died.The median FI for the full population was 0.16 (IQR\u00a0=\u00a00.11\u20130.23).

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between asthma and reproductive factors, including age at first childbirth and parity, in a representative sample of Korean women.We analyzed data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2010\u20132012). A total of 7837 adults who completed a questionnaire and examination were evaluated. The presence of asthma was based on the Health Interview Survey. Reproductive factors were estimated by trained interviewers using participant recall.The women with asthma were significantly older than those without asthma. BMI, hypertension, education level, income level, occupation, alcohol consumption, and age at menarche and first birth were significantly associated with the diagnosis of asthma. Higher parity was positively associated with later-onset asthma. In addition, women who were younger at first birth had a greater prevalence of later-onset asthma. After controlling for confounders, being aged under 20 at first birth was significantly associated with an asthma diagnosis compared with women aged 25\u201329 at first birth (OR [95% CI]: 1.81 [1.14\u20132.89]).Although higher parity was associated with asthma in women, its significance disappeared after adjustment. These results warrant future studies to explore the mechanisms responsible for the association between reproductive factors and asthma.",

Illiteracy, dementia, clinically significant depression and disability were factors to receive special emphasis.A community sample of 4803 individuals aged over 55 years was assessed in a two-phase case-finding study in Zaragoza, Spain, and was followed up for 16 years. Medical history and psychiatric history were collected with standardized instruments, including the History and Aetiology Schedule, the Geriatric Mental State (GMS) scale, and a Risk Factors Questionnaire. Operational criteria were used to define covariates, including diagnostic criteria for both dementia and depression.The statistical analysis included calculations of incidence rate, IR; women/men incidence rate ratio (IRR); and Hazard Ratios (HR) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models.Cases of hip fracture (International Classification of Diseases, WHO) identified in the treating hospitals, validated by blinded researchers.Hip fractures were more frequent among women than men (IRR\u00a0=\u00a03.1).

     "abstract": "Thyroid nodules constitute by far the most common disorder of the endocrine system. Epidemiological studies have indicated that approximately 5% of women and 1% of men resident in iodine-sufficient areas have palpable thyroid nodules. However, by the age of 60 years about 50% of the general population is estimated to have at least one thyroid nodule. Indeed, the reported prevalence of a \u201cthyroid incidentaloma\u201d is up to 70% when neck/carotid artery ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is performed for other indications. Of those with a nodule, 7\u201315% will have a thyroid carcinoma. The objective of this article is to present updated information on the definition, prevalence, imaging and functional features of thyroid nodules and to provide guidance on the optimal assessment, treatment and follow-up strategy. The endocrinologist dealing with a patient with a thyroid nodule has to consider two main clinical issues: (i) the possibility of thyroid hormonal excess (hyperthyroidism) and (ii) the risk of malignancy. The former is determined by the assessment of the serum concentrations of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), as well as of peripheral thyroid hormones and a thyroid radionuclide scan, if necessary; the latter is achieved by the use of thyroid ultrasonography, as well as fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) and serum calcitonin measurement, if necessary. These assessments will guide management, which can vary from simple follow-up to surgical resection. The indications for surgical management, simple follow-up, conservative therapy or treatment with radioactive iodine are discussed.",

An electronic PubMed and Scopus search through to 09/01/2016 and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies comparing serum levels of inflammatory cytokines between patients with sarcopenia and controls was made, calculating random-effects standardized mean differences (SMDs) \u00b195% confidence intervals (CIs) as the effect size. Out of 1370 initial hits, 17 studies with a total of 11249 participants (3072 with sarcopenia and 8177 without) were meta-analyzed. Sarcopenic participants had significantly higher levels of CRP (SMD\u00a0=\u00a00.51; 95%CI 0.26, 0.77; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; I2\u00a0=\u00a096%) than controls.

     "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic joint disorder and its prevalence increases rapidly during midlife. Complex interactions of genetic alterations, sex hormone deficit, and aging with mechanical factors and systemic inflammation-associated metabolic syndrome lead to joint damage. Thus, the expression of a clinical phenotype in the early stages of OA relies on the main underlying pathway and predominant joint tissue involved at a given time. Moreover, OA often coexists with other morbidities in the same patient, which in turn condition the OA process. In this scenario, an appropriate identification of clinical phenotypes, especially in the early stages of the disease, may optimize the design of individualized treatments in OA. An ESCEO-EUGMS (European Union Geriatric Medicine Society) working group has recently suggested possible patient profiles in OA. Hereby, we propose the existence of 4 clinical phenotypes \u2013 biomechanical, osteoporotic, metabolic and inflammatory \u2013 whose characterization would help to properly stratify patients with OA in clinical trials or studies.

     "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes is a global epidemic, and the prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes are increasing. The negative effects of diabetes on kidneys, nerves, and vessels are well established. The effect of diabetes on reproductive function is less well understood, but important to characterize, given the increasing numbers of young women with diabetes. In this review, we summarize the available literature on how women with diabetes experience ovarian aging, from menarche to menopause. We report that women with type 1 diabetes appear more likely to have ovarian dysfunction, manifested by delayed menses, menstrual irregularities, and possibly earlier menopause. Studies of women with type 2 diabetes are inconsistent but suggest increased anovulation and earlier menopause. Differences in reproductive aging between women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes raise questions about potential differences in the mechanisms contributing to ovarian aging. Although there is shared glycemic dysregulation, fundamental differences in insulin presence and processing distinguish the two diseases. This review suggests that insulin, age at diagnosis, and weight play a role in ovarian dysfunction. More long-term studies are needed to evaluate the multitude of factors that may disrupt hypothalamic, pituitary, and ovarian function in women with diabetes.",

In this study, we investigate whether women with POI had experienced a different perinatal milieu, as reflected in their birth weight or prematurity.In this retrospective case-control study, we evaluated whether women diagnosed with POI had a different birth weight or prematurity rate (<37 weeks) compared with women aged over 40 at natural menopause (the controls). Binary logistic regression models were used to analyze the data and correct for smoking. 59 women with POI and 92 controls were recruited.13.6% of women diagnosed with POI were born prematurely, compared with 6.6% of controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.018). Corrected for gestational age, women with POI did not have a different birth weight compared with controls. As a consequence of the design of our study, mean age at time of interview differed significantly between groups, at 37.5 and 46 years respectively for women diagnosed with POI and controls. Years of oral contraception use, smoking, age at menarche, BMI and education levels were similar in the two groups.Our findings indicate that prematurity is a risk factor for POI. Prenatal factors contributing to prematurity, or postnatal factors that are the result of prematurity, may lead to early follicle depletion.",

Therefore, we designed a randomised controlled trial to study the effect, on self-efficacy related to treatment decisions, of a conversation about treatment goals between GPs and patients with cancer in a palliative setting.We aim to include 168 patients aged \u226570 years with a diagnosis of non-curable cancer, due to consult their oncologist about treatment options. In the intervention group, patients will consult their GP using an Outcome Prioritisation Tool (OPT). The control group will receive care as usual. The primary outcome will be the score on a decision self-efficacy scale after the consultation with the oncologist. Secondary outcomes will be symptoms of depression, anxiety, or fatigue. In an embedded observational study of the intervention group, we aim to assess the prioritisation of treatment goals (i.e., OPT scores), and their determinants, over a six-month period.The OPTion study should provide relevant information about the effect on self-efficacy of a consultation between GPs and older patients with cancer, concerning preferred treatment goals in a palliative setting.Dutch Trial Register NTR5419",

Participants were assessed for age, menopausal status, lifestyle factors, body composition, and dietary habits using a brief-type self-administered diet history questionnaire, which provides information on the amounts of nearly 100 nutritional factors consumed during the previous month. Classifying body mass index (BMI) as low (\u226422\u00a0kg/m2) or high (>22\u00a0kg/m2) and percentage body fat as low (\u226425%) or high (>25%), we sought to identify the nutritional factors associated with BMI and percentage body fat.Consumption differences between high/low BMI and high/low body fat percentage groups were not significant for any nutritional factors except cryptoxanthin. Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusting for age, menopausal status, working, exercise, and smoking revealed that higher cryptoxanthin intake was associated with low BMI (adjusted odds ratio, 1.22 per 100\u00a0\u03bcg/day increase of cryptoxanthin intake; 95% confidence interval, 1.01\u20131.52) and low body fat percentage (adjusted odds ratio, 1.36 per 100\u00a0\u03bcg/day increase of cryptoxanthin intake; 95% confidence interval, 1.13\u20131.70).Higher intake of cryptoxanthin was shown to be related to low body mass and body fat in Japanese middle-aged women.",

     "abstract": "Estrogens are known to stimulate the growth of breast cancer but they are also an effective treatment for this disease (this has been termed the \u2018estrogen paradox\u2019). The fact that estrogens can be an effective treatment for breast cancer is something that has almost been forgotten, whereas the fear for estrogens remains. This paper reviews the use of estrogens for the treatment of breast cancer and identifies possible applications. The data summarised in this review demonstrate that high-dose estrogens are effective for the treatment of advanced breast cancer, both as first-line treatment as well as for treatment after occurrence of endocrine resistance to TAM and AIs. Essential for efficacy is an extended period of estrogen deprivation before the tumour is subject to estrogen treatment (the gap hypothesis). Research on the mechanism of action has shown that apoptosis induced by estrogens is regulated via the estrogen receptor and growth factor signalling pathways. High-dose estrogens have a negative safety image, especially in terms of side-effects and increased rates of cardiovascular disease, but the safety data reviewed in this paper do not give rise to major concerns. Taking into account their side-effect profile together with their observed clinical efficacy, high-dose estrogens should be considered a valuable alternative to chemotherapy in selected patients.",

     "abstract": "The widespread availability of effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed HIV from a life-limiting condition to one with near-normal life expectancy. HIV is associated with an increased risk of osteopenia and osteoporosis, with people living with HIV (PLHIV) potentially experiencing these conditions at a younger age than their HIV-negative counterparts. The mechanisms driving bone disease in HIV are complex and include: an increased prevalence of traditional risk factors; other comorbid conditions; and HIV-associated factors such as viral effects, systemic inflammation, and ART-related factors.One-third of PLHIV in the United Kingdom are female, and increasing numbers of women living with HIV (WLHIV) are reaching menopausal age. Oestrogen decline in the context of an elevated background risk of poor bone health results in WLHIV being at greater risk of osteoporosis than women without HIV. European HIV guidelines therefore recommend routine screening of postmenopausal WLHIV using FRAX\u00a9 for clinical risk factors, with or without bone mineral density scanning.Data support the use of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis in PLHIV. Additionally, some patients with confirmed osteoporosis may benefit from a switch to an ART agent with a better bone safety profile. However, there remains a notable paucity of data on HIV and menopause, including the impact of hormone replacement therapy on the bone health of WLHIV.In conclusion, it is important that clinicians are aware that postmenopausal WLHIV are a group at particular risk of bone disease, who require proactive screening and advice about preventative measures.",

     "abstract": "Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are the first-line recommended standard of care for postmenopausal estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Because they cause a profound suppression of estrogen levels, concerns regarding their potential to increase the risk of fracture were rapidly raised. There is currently a general consensus that a careful baseline evaluation is needed of the risk of fracture in postmenopausal women about to start treatment with AIs but also in all premenopausal women with early disease. Bisphosphonates have been shown in several phase III trials to prevent the bone loss induced by cancer treatment, although no fracture data are available. Even though they do not have regulatory approval for this indication, their use must be discussed with women at high risk of fracture. Accordingly, several guidelines recommend considering treatment in women with a T-score \u2264\u22122 or those with two or more clinical risk factors. Moreover, recent data suggest that bisphosphonates, especially intravenous zoledronic acid, may have an anticancer effect, in that they reduce bone recurrence as well as extra-skeletal metastasis and breast cancer mortality in postmenopausal women. The anti-RANK ligand antibody denosumab is also emerging as a new adjuvant therapeutic option to prevent AI-induced bone loss. It has been shown to extend the time to first fracture in postmenopausal women treated with AIs. Several issues still need to be addressed regarding the use of these different agents in an adjuvant setting. The purpose of this position statement is to review the literature on antifracture therapy and to discuss the current guidelines for the management of osteoporosis in women with early breast cancer.",

Many of these phytochemicals are being used in chemoprevention strategies. However, the scientific evidence regarding the modification of cancer risk continues to be debated.The aim of this paper is to review the current scientific evidence and the most relevant epidemiological studies regarding the consumption or use of phytochemicals and their effects on the incidence of cancer.A search for relevant articles was conducted in EMBASE and PubMed-NCBI through to May 2016 to identify potential interactions between the consumption or use of phytochemicals and cancer risk.The use or consumption of carotenoids, such as lycopene, alpha-carotene, and betacarotene, leads to a reduction in the risk of cancer, such as breast and prostate tumours. For breast cancer, beta-carotene even reduces the risk of recurrence. The use or consumption of soybean isoflavones has led to a reduction in the risk of lung, prostate, colon (in women only), and breast cancers, although this has depended on menopausal and oestrogen receptor status. The use or consumption of isothiocyanates and indole-3-carbinol also seems to reduce the risk of cancer, such as breast, stomach, colorectal, or prostate tumours.The adoption of a diet rich in phytochemicals is associated with a modification of cancer risk. However, the scientific data supporting its use come mainly from in vitro and in vivo studies (especially in animal models). The epidemiological evidence is inconclusive for many of these phytochemicals, so further studies are needed.",

Subgroup analyses by menopausal status and age ( \u2264 55 vs >55y) for IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 showed the subgroups were similar, although heterogeneity remained high.The evidence suggests that levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 are lower in patients with ovarian cancer. In contrast, higher levels of IGBP-2 and IGBP-1 are found in patients with ovarian cancer.",

Nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (NSRH) improves QOL by selectively sparing innervation of bladder, bowel and vagina, reducing therapy-induced morbidity. However, the oncological outcome and the functional outcome after NSRH are subjects of debate. We aim to present the best possible evidence available regarding both QOL and survival after NSRH in early-stage cervical cancer.Systematic review and meta-analysis on studies comparing NSRH and RH.Forty-one studies were included, and 27 were used for the meta-analysis. There was no difference in 2-, 3- and 5-year overall survival: the risk ratios (RRs) were respectively 1.02 (95% CI 0.99\u20131.05, n\u00a0=\u00a0879), 1.01 (95% CI 0.95\u20131.08, n\u00a0=\u00a01324) and 1.03 (95% CI 0.99\u20131.08, n\u00a0=\u00a0638).

     "abstract": "Female sexual dysfunction (FSD) and quality of life (QOL) are both multidimensional and have a bidirectional relationship across the reproductive life span and beyond. Methodological difficulties exist in estimating the real prevalence of FSD because it is hard to determine the level of distress associated with sexual symptoms in a large-scale survey. Approximately 40\u201350% of all women report at least one sexual symptom, and some conditions associated with hormonal changes at menopause, such as vulvovaginal atrophy (VVA) and hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), have a significant impact on sexual function and QOL. Sexual distress peaks at midlife, declines with age and is strongly partner-related. Many postmenopausal women are still sexually active, especially if they are in a stable partnership. Even though sexual functioning is impaired, a variety of psychosocial factors may maintain sexual satisfaction. That being so, health care providers (HCPs) should proactively address sexual symptoms at midlife and in older women, from a balanced perspective. Adequate counselling should be offered. Women with distressing symptoms may benefit from tailored hormonal and non-hormonal therapies, whereas women without distress related to their sexual experiences should not receive any specific treatment.",

     "abstract": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease is the most frequent cause of dementia in older patients. The prevalence is higher in women than in men. This may be the result of both the higher life expectancy of women and the loss of neuroprotective estrogen after menopause. Earlier age at menopause (spontaneous or surgical) is associated with an enhanced risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Therefore, it is postulated that estrogen could be protective against it. If so, increasing exposure to estrogen through the use of postmenopausal hormone replacement could also be protective against Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The results of the clinical studies that have examined this hypothesis are inconclusive, however. One explanation for this is that estrogen treatment is protective only if it is initiated in the years immediately after menopause. Another possibility is that the neuroprotective effects of estrogen are negated by a particular genotype of apolipoprotein E. This protein plays an important role in cholesterol transport to the neurons. Studies that have examined the link between estrogen replacement therapy, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and the E4 allele of ApoE are inconclusive. This article reviews the literature on the influence of hormone replacement therapy on the incidence and progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.",

     "abstract": "As populations age, numbers of older carers are increasing. These carers play a vital role in supporting others, often partners or spouses with dementia.This narrative review synthesised peer-reviewed evidence published over the last two decades concerning the experiences of carers aged over 75 years, specifically exploring whether their experiences differ from those of younger carers. Four electronic databases were searched and 4102 publications were identified. Eighteen studies involving over one thousand carer participants were included (11 quantitative, 6 qualitative, and 1 mixed-methods study). Most studies came from Europe or North America and almost all were cross-sectional, but few directly compared younger and older carers, making it difficult to determine whether carers\u2019 experiences vary with age. Quantitative studies generally emphasised the challenges of caring and frequently highlighted, for example, relationships between carer characteristics and negative outcomes such as burden. Qualitative studies were often more positive, emphasising carers\u2019 active responses and the rewards of caring. The normality of caring was highlighted, with some suggesting that caring may be less challenging for older than for younger carers.As with younger carers, being an older carer can be both rewarding and difficult. Our understanding of the experiences of these older carers would be enhanced with more research specifically comparing older and younger carers or comparing older carers and those not in a caring role. Carers are diverse and future research should explore the experiences of carers from different demographic groups. More longitudinal research perhaps focusing on caring dyads and mutual caring is needed.",

We aimed to describe the distribution of sleep disorders, according to demographic, geographic and anthropometric characteristics, in adult Colombian populations.A multicenter study was conducted with 5474 participants recruited from three Colombian cities at different altitudes. A two-stage cluster sampling method was applied. Participants\u2019 mean age was 40.2 years and 53.8% were female. Collected data included demographic information and anthropometric characteristics of adiposity such as body mass index, neck circumference and waist circumference, as well as participants\u2019 scores on five scales used to assess sleep disorders. Disorders included sleepiness, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, poor sleep quality and restless legs syndrome; the scales were the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Berlin questionnaire, STOP-Bang questionnaire, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and diagnostic criteria for the restless legs syndrome set out by the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group.Nearly two-thirds of the population reported at least one sleep disorder according to their results on the five scales (59.6% [95%CI 57.4; 61.81)]. This proportion was similar by sex. Prevalence of overweight was 34.8% and of obesity was 14.4%. Sleep disorders were more frequent among those aged 65 years or more (91.11 [95%CI 86.1; 94.43]), those who were obese (83.71% [95%CI 78.94; 87.56]) and those who resided in the cities at the lowest altitude (72.4% [95%CI 70.2; 74.5]). Waist circumference showed a stronger association with sleep disorders among women than among men.Sleep disorders are common in Colombia, irrespective of sex and geographical location. They are associated with obesity. Abdominal obesity could explain the high frequency of sleep disorders among women.We believe that this part of the study will substantially contribute to the understanding of sleep disorders.

The sample comprised 2137 older adults who were interviewed in 2002 and re-interviewed in the following waves. Cross-tabulations were run to show the rise in chronic disease and disability with age. Ordinal logistic regression was run to examine the debilitating effects of these diseases in terms of the ability of the oldest old to perform activities of daily living.The prevalence of chronic diseases rose sharply with age. The prevalence rate of six major diseases increased between 38% (respiratory diseases) and 533% (neurological disorder) among respondents who were re-interviewed nine years later. Cardiovascular diseases were the most common. Neurological disorder and cancer were less common, but had the most debilitating effects on patients. Overall, 10.0%, 3.1% and 3.1% of the respondents were disabled by cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and sensorial diseases, respectively. Ordinal logistic regression showed that neurological disorder had the strongest debilitating effects, followed by musculoskeletal and cardiovascular diseases among 2137 older persons who had survived and were followed up from the base year (2002) through 2011.The rapid rise in chronic diseases has resulted in an increased burden of disability among the oldest old in China.

Multilevel zero-inflated Negative Binomial models for EAs nested by datazone were created, adjusting for sex, 5-year age group, area-level deprivation (SIMD quintile), season, month and month squared. Models were also run for EAs by cause, for three causes: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), falls and dementia. The rate of EAs first rose then fell during the study period. When modelled, RRs for month (RR for month 12 relative to month 1 and 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02 (0.99, 1.06)) and month squared (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.999 (0.998, 0.999)) indicated a rise in admissions until February 2012, followed by a fall. Risk of admission was greater for males and increased with increasing age group. The risk of going into hospital for those from SIMD 5 (most affluent) was 0.58 (0.56, 0.59) relative to those from SIMD 1 (most deprived). Socioeconomic inequalities were particularly great for COPD-related admissions, where RR for SIMD 5 was 0.25 (0.23, 0.28) times that of SIMD 1. An interaction term between month and SIMD was not significant for any outcome. For dementia-related EAs there was a suggestion that inequalities may be reducing over time.

The death risks due to ACS before admission to hospital, 2\u201328, or 29\u2013365\u00a0days after the incident ACS were compared between HT users and non-users with logistic regression analyses.In all follow-up time points, the ACS death risks in HT ever-users were smaller compared to non-users. Of women with HT ever use, 42% died within one year as compared with 52% of non-users (OR 0.62, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Most deaths (84%) occurred within 28\u00a0days after the ACS, and in this group 36% of women with ever use of HT (OR 0.73, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and 30% of women with \u22655\u00a0year HT use (OR 0.54, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) died as compared to 43% of the non-users. Age \u226460 or >60 years at the HT initiation was accompanied with similar reductions in ACS mortality risk.Postmenopausal HT use is accompanied with reduced mortality risk after primary ACS.",

     "abstract": "Increasing research suggests that periodontal status is associated with hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women. This study was performed to assess the relationship between the number of natural teeth and ever use of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women using nationally representative Korean data.Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2010 and 2012 were used, and the analysis in this study was confined to a total of 4869 respondents over 19 years old who had gone through menopause and who had no missing data for the reproductive factors and outcome variables in that study. The total number of natural teeth was then calculated after excluding third molars. The time of day when tooth brushing was done was recorded as representative oral health behavior. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess association between the number of natural teeth and the use of hormone replacement therapy.Among participants who had ever used hormone replacement therapy, the proportions (percentage and standard error) with no teeth, 1\u20139 teeth, 10\u201319 teeth, 20\u201327 teeth, and 28 teeth were 5.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4%, 6.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4%, 12.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7%, 18.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0%, and 20.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6%, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for having fewer than 20 teeth <20 was 0.624 [0.464\u20130.840] for the individuals using hormone replacement therapy, after adjustments.The analysis revealed that the use of hormone replacement therapy by postmenopausal women showed positive effects for retention of natural teeth. Lack of hormone replacement therapy may be considered to be an independent risk indicator for tooth loss in Korean postmenopausal women.",

We used the Basic Nordic Sleep Questionnaire to study sleep; additional questionnaires evaluated risk factors for sleep impairment.Sleep quality differed only marginally between the groups. The following baseline variables were associated with impaired sleep quality at follow-up: depressive symptoms increased the risk of nocturnal awakenings (OR 1.16 (95%CI 1.02\u20131.32), p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), morning tiredness (OR 1.22 (95%CI 1.06\u20131.40), p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), daytime tiredness (OR 1.24 (95%CI 1.06\u20131.44), p\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and propensity to fall asleep during work or leisure time (OR 1.18 (95%CI 1.01\u20131.37), p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). Personal crises increased the risk of longer sleep latency (OR 5.46 (95%CI 1.13\u201326.32), p\u00a0=\u00a00.035) and of propensity to fall asleep when not active (OR 5.41 (95%CI 1.42\u201320.83), p\u00a0=\u00a00.014).

Perceived impaired general health (OR 2.87 (95%CI 1.04\u20137.94), p\u00a0=\u00a00.043) and frequent night sweats (OR 10.50 (95%CI 2.25\u201349.01), p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) increased the risk of difficulty falling asleep.Various premenopausal health-related factors seem to predict poor sleep in menopausal transition. Menopause itself appears to have only minor effects. Thus, it is essential to identify high-risk women to allow timely interventions that may prevent the development of sleep disturbances at menopause.",

The prevalence has been reported to be particularly high during the menopausal transition, but there is no consensus supporting a direct association with reproductive status. This may be partly due to methodological limitations and inconsistencies in the available studies, resulting from a large number of confounding factors. In addition, relationships between sex hormones and the neurotransmitters purported to be responsible for depression are complex. What appears to be universally accepted is that treatment, with oestrogen, for low mood in women during midlife years may be beneficial, and should be considered.",

     "abstract": "Ageing is accompanied by an increased risk of disease and a loss of functioning on several bodily and mental domains and some argue that maintaining health and functioning is essential for a successful old age. Paradoxically, studies have shown that overall wellbeing follows a curvilinear pattern with the lowest point at middle age but increases thereafter up to very old age.To shed further light on this paradox, we reviewed the existing literature on how scholars define successful ageing and how they weigh the contribution of health and functioning to define success.We performed a novel, hypothesis-free and quantitative analysis of citation networks exploring the literature on successful ageing that exists in the Web of Science Core Collection Database using the CitNetExplorer software. Outcomes were visualized using timeline-based citation patterns. The clusters and sub-clusters of citation networks identified were starting points for in-depth qualitative analysis.Within the literature from 1902 through 2015, two distinct citation networks were identified. The first cluster had 1146 publications and 3946 citation links. It focused on successful ageing from the perspective of older persons themselves. Analysis of the various sub-clusters emphasized the importance of coping strategies, psycho-social engagement, and cultural differences. The second cluster had 609 publications and 1682 citation links and viewed successful ageing based on the objective measurements as determined by researchers. Subsequent sub-clustering analysis pointed to different domains of functioning and various ways of assessment.In the current literature two mutually exclusive concepts of successful ageing are circulating that depend on whether the individual himself or an outsider judges the situation. These different points of view help to explain the disability paradox, as successful ageing lies in the eyes of the beholder.",

     "abstract": "The world is aging. The population aged over sixty years worldwide is predicted to rise from 841 million in 2013 to more than 2 billion by 2050. Musculoskeletal (MSK) disease is a significant burden on the aging population, contributing 7.5% of the disease burden in those aged over 60 years. MSK diseases have a pronounced effect on disability level and independence in old age, with a consequent significant public health burden and impact on quality of later life. As numbers of older individuals and their disease burden increase, it is important to examine MSK disease in older life in detail. The musculoskeletal aging phenotype comprises four often interwoven key elements \u2013 osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, sarcopenia and frailty \u2212 and this review will focus on these four themes. It is crucial that we are able to accurately measure each phenotype in order that we might identify those individuals at greatest risk of developing these conditions, and design trials of therapeutic agents that might impact their development. Accurate measurement of the musculoskeletal aging phenotype is necessary firstly to document the burden of each condition, and then to enable factors to be identified which may accelerate or retard their development or progression. In some areas of MSK disease, this work is more advanced (osteoporosis); in other areas (sarcopenia) the field is currently very rapidly evolving. We will explore the tools currently used to measure the musculoskeletal aging phenotype and how they compare, as well as highlight areas where more work is needed.",

In this review, we assess the usefulness of various models, including unicellular yeasts, invertebrate worms and flies, mice and primates including humans, and highlight the benefits and possible drawbacks of each model system in its ability to illuminate human ageing mechanisms. We describe the strong evolutionary conservation of molecular pathways that govern cell responses to extracellular and intracellular signals and which are strongly implicated in ageing. Such pathways centre around insulin-like growth factor signalling and integration of stress and nutritional signals through mTOR kinase. The process of cellular senescence is evaluated as a possible underlying cause for many of the frailties and diseases of human ageing. Also considered is ageing arising from systemic changes that cannot be modelled in lower organisms and instead require studies either in small mammals or in primates.

     "abstract": "Ageing describes the progressive functional decline of an organism over time, leading to an increase in susceptibility to age-related diseases and eventually to death, and it is a phenomenon observed across a wide range of organisms. Despite a vast repertoire of ageing studies performed over the past century, the exact causes of ageing remain unknown. For over 50 years it has been speculated that mitochondria play a key role in the ageing process, due mainly to correlative data showing an increase in mitochondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) with age. However, the exact role of the mitochondria in the ageing process remains unknown.The skin is often used to study human ageing, due to its easy accessibility, and the observation that the ageing process is able to be accelerated in this organ via environmental insults, such as ultra violet radiation (UVR). This provides a useful tool to investigate the mechanisms regulating ageing and, in particular, the role of the mitochondria. Observations from dermatological and photoageing studies can provide useful insights into chronological ageing of the skin and other organs such as the brain and liver. Moreover, a wide range of diseases are associated with ageing; therefore, understanding the cause of the ageing process as well as regulatory mechanisms involved could provide potentially advantageous therapeutic targets for the prevention or treatment of such diseases.",

Among classical estrogen receptors, estrogen receptor beta (ER\u03b2) has been suggested as a therapeutic target. However, little is known about the role of ER\u03b2 in the female brain. Six electronic databases were searched for articles evaluating the role of ER\u03b2 in the female brain and the influence of age and menopause on ER\u03b2 function. After screening 3186 titles and abstracts, 49 articles were included in the review, all of which were animal studies. Of these, 19 focused on cellular signaling, 7 on neuroendocrine pathways, 8 on neurological disorders, 4 on neuroprotection and 19 on psychological and psychiatric outcomes (6 studies evaluated two or more outcomes). Our findings showed that ER\u03b2 phosphorylated and activated intracellular second messenger proteins and regulated protein expression of genes involved in neurological functions. It also promoted neurogenesis, modulated the neuroendocrine regulation of stress response, conferred neuroprotection against ischemia and inflammation, and reduced anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. Targeting ER\u03b2 may constitute a novel treatment for menopausal symptoms, including anxiety, depression, and neurological diseases. However, to establish potential therapeutic and preventive strategies targeting ER\u03b2, future studies should be conducted in humans to further our understanding of the importance of ER\u03b2 in women\u2019s mental and cognitive health.",

     "abstract": "Cognitive difficulties and gait abnormalities both increase with age. We review normal and pathologic changes in both gait and cognition in older adults. Gait performance in older individuals is linked to specific cognitive changes, in particular in executive function. Structural and functional assays highlight the shared anatomic control of cognitive and gait function, mostly in the prefrontal cortices. Cognitive impairment can be used to predict incident gait difficulties. Changes in gait, especially decreased gait velocity, may be a harbinger of impending cognitive decline. The combination of slow gait and cognitive complaints (the Motoric Cognitive Risk syndrome) is a powerful new clinical tool to identify those at high risk of developing dementia and therefore may be used to target interventions. Evidence is limited, but cognitive training and targeted physical activity may be useful to mitigate or prevent gait and cognitive decline with age.",

     "abstract": "Regular physical activity (PA) promotes musculoskeletal health in older adults. However, the majority of older individuals do not meet current PA guidelines and are also highly sedentary. Emerging evidence indicates that large amounts of sedentary time accelerate the loss of skeletal muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia) and physical function with advancing age. However, current PA recommendations for sedentary time are non-specific (i.e., keep sedentary time to a minimum). Research indicates that physical inactivity and large amounts of sedentary time accelerate sarcopenic muscle loss by inducing skeletal muscle \u2018anabolic resistance\u2019. These findings suggest a critical interaction between engaging in \u2018sufficient\u2019 levels of PA, minimising sedentary time, and consuming \u2018adequate\u2019 nutrition to promote optimal musculoskeletal health in older adults. However, current PA recommendations do not take into account the important role that nutrition plays in ensuring older adults can maximise the benefits from the PA in which they engage. The aim of this narrative review is: (1) to briefly summarise the evidence used to inform current public health recommendations for PA and sedentary time in older adults; and (2) to discuss the presence of \u2018anabolic resistance\u2019 in older adults, highlighting the importance of regular PA and minimising sedentary behaviour. It is imperative that the synergy between PA, minimising sedentary behaviour and adequate nutrition is integrated into future PA guidelines to promote optimal musculoskeletal health and metabolic responses in the growing ageing population.",

We included epidemiologic studies and clinical trials carried out on people aged over 65 years. We included 32 studies with a total of over 50,000 participants.The prevalence of frailty is ranges from 15% among elderly people living in the community to 54% among those hospitalized. Furthermore, the prevalence of frailty is disproportionately high among elderly people who are malnourished. Malnutrition, which is very prevalent in geriatric populations, is one of the main risk factors for the onset of frailty.A good nutritional status and, wherever necessary, supplementation with macronutrients and micronutrients reduce the risk of developing frailty. Physical exercise has been shown to improve functional status, helps to prevent frailty and is an effective treatment to reverse it. Despite the relatively large number of studies included, this review has some limitations. Firstly, variability in the design of the studies and their different aims reduce their comparability. Secondly, several of the studies did not adequately define frailty.Poor nutritional status is associated with the onset of frailty. Screening and early diagnosis of malnutrition and frailty in elderly people will help to prevent the onset of disability. Effective treatment is based on correction of the macro- and micronutrient deficit and physical exercise.",

Yet, clinical trials investigating common dietary antioxidants, such as vitamins, have often failed to find a significant lowering effect on markers of oxidative stress. This review examines the latest clinical evidence on whether three novel potential antioxidant foods\u2014fish omega-3 fatty acids, red wine and dairy products\u2014can affect the oxidative status of healthy individuals. Clinical studies have reported heterogeneous results regarding the effect of fish oil, red wine and dairy products on oxidative stress. However, numerous studies have suggested that omega-3, red wine and dairy products may lower lipid peroxidation, a known trigger of cardiovascular disease, without affecting the oxidative status of healthy individuals. Overall, this review suggests that consumption of 1\u20132\u00a0g/day of omega-3, a moderate red wine intake (200\u2013400\u00a0ml/day) or 2\u20133 portions/day of dairy products within a healthy diet exert beneficial effects on oxidative markers. Further investigation to ascertain these effects should focus on the antioxidant effects of long-term omega-3 supplementation, and of intake of dealcoholized red wine or higher dairy product consumption.",

We investigated whether the decrease in oocyte quality associated with aging is related to altered mitochondria.Oocytes from old (12 months) and young (9 weeks) C57BL/6J mice were compared in relation to: mitochondria morphology and dynamics (mitochondria density, coverage, size and shape) throughout folliculogenesis; levels of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA); mitochondrial stress reflected in the expression of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mt-UPR) genes; and levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under baseline conditions and following H2O2 treatment.In old mice, mitochondria of primary follicle-enclosed oocytes were smaller, with lower mitochondria coverage (total mitochondria \u03bcm2/\u03bcm2 cytosol area) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Other follicular stages showed a similar trend, but the changes were not significant.

Our objective was to determine whether the dietary vitamin K intake was associated with the presence and severity of subjective memory complaint among older adults.Observational, cross-sectional cohort study.One hundred sixty older adults taking no vitamin K antagonist were included. The daily dietary vitamin K intake was assessed using a 50-item food frequency questionnaire.

However, the impact of comorbid depression in older patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma has not been fully explored. This narrative review examines the impact of comorbid depression and its management in COPD and asthma in older adults. The causes of depression in patients with COPD and asthma are multifactorial and include physical, physiological and behavioural factors. Depression is associated with hospital readmission in older adults with asthma and COPD. We focus on the most current literature that has examined the efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and antidepressant drug therapy for patients with depression in the context of COPD and asthma. Our findings indicate that PR and CBT are beneficial in improving depressive symptoms and quality of life in short-term intervention studies. However, the long-term efficacy of CBT and PR is unknown. To date, the efficacy of antidepressant drug therapy for depression in patients with COPD and asthma is inconclusive. In addition, there has been no clear evidence that antidepressants can induce remission of depression or ameliorate dyspnoea or physiological indices of COPD. Factors that contribute to \u2018inadequate\u2019 assessment and treatment of depression in patients with COPD and asthma may include misconception of the disease by patients and their caregivers and stigma attached to depression.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 44 genetic variants that are associated with age of onset of natural menopause. Genes linked with menopause can be classified into three major groups: genes implicated in genome stability (DNA repair), immune function and mitochondrial biogenesis. Biological and epidemiological data indicate that reproductive performance, age at menopause and longevity are interlinked through common genetic factors, which play a pivotal role in DNA repair and genome maintenance, which has been linked before with the process of ageing. Consequently, ageing of the soma as a result of inefficient DNA repair appears also to be responsible for failure to reproduce and the subsequent occurrence of menopause. In this way reproductive performance may be strongly linked to the physical condition of the soma and may be a very good predictor of general health in later life.",

A number of inter-related factors, including pre-existing cognitive impairment, usually contribute to the development of delirium in a particular susceptible individual. Non-pharmacological approaches to prevention typically target multiple risk factors in a systematic manner (multicomponent interventions). There is generally good evidence that multicomponent interventions reduce the incidence of delirium in hospital populations but there are limited data in people with dementia and those living in the community. It is likely that there is a differential effect of specific interventions in those with cognitive impairment (e.g. people with dementia may respond better to simpler, more pragmatic interventions rather than complex procedures) but this cannot be determined from the existing data. Targeted interventions focussed on hydration, medication rationalization and sleep promotion may also be effective in reducing the incidence of delirium, as well as the active involvement of family members in the care of the elderly hospitalized patient. Hospitalization itself is a potential risk factor for delirium and promising data are emerging of the benefits of home-based care as an alternative to hospitalization but this is restricted to specific sub-populations of patients and is reliant on these services being available.",

We performed searches of English-language publications on Medline, PubMed, Ovid and the Cochrane Library from January 1, 1990 to November 25, 2015.

Malnutrition is associated with a multitude of adverse outcomes, including increased risk of infections, falls, pressure ulcers and hospital admissions, all of which can lead to increased health care costs and poorer quality of life. A number of food and nutrition strategies have demonstrated positive nutritional and clinical outcomes in the RAC setting. These strategies extend beyond simply enhancing the nutritional value of foods and hence necessitate the involvement of a range of committed stakeholders. Implementing a nutritional protocol in RAC facilities that comprises routine nutrition screening, assessment, appropriate nutrition intervention, including attention to food service systems, and monitoring by a multidisciplinary team can help prevent decline in residents\u2019 nutritional status.

Estrogen may even be protective against certain cancers. Menopausal hormone therapy is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and mortality after diagnosis of some cancer types, but not others. We provide a narrative review of the medical literature regarding the risk of cancer recurrence and associated mortality with initiation of MHT after the diagnosis of breast, gynecologic, lung, colorectal, hematologic cancers, and melanoma. Menopausal hormone therapy may be considered for management of bothersome menopausal symptoms in women with some cancer types (e.g., colorectal and hematologic cancer, localized melanoma, and most cervical, vulvar and vaginal cancers), while nonhormonal treatment options may be preferred for others (e.g., breast cancer). In women with other cancer types, recommendations are less straightforward, and the use of MHT must be individualized.",

     "abstract": "Dementia is usually diagnosed in later life but can occur in younger people. The experiences of those with older-onset dementia are relatively well understood but little is known about the experiences of those with young-onset dementia (aged less than 65 years).This meta-ethnography therefore synthesised qualitative literature investigating the experiences of people with young-onset dementia (YOD). Six electronic databases were searched and 1155 studies were identified, of which eight fitted the inclusion criteria.These studies were all from Western countries, were mostly recent (2004\u20132015) and included the experiences of 87 people with YOD. Participants were generally in their fifties or early sixties and were living at home with others. Many reported difficulties both in the process of receiving a diagnosis and afterwards. Diagnosis felt unexpected, \u2018out of time\u2019 and led to changes in self-identity, powerlessness and changes in relationships. Social exclusion was common. Loss of meaningful activity exacerbated a difficult situation. However, the diagnosis did not mean people\u2019s lives were over and many with YOD try to regain control by seeking connections with others with the same condition \u2212 sometimes a very important source of support.Overall, people living with YOD face unique social challenges which go beyond those of older people living with dementia and which result in an even greater negative impact on their lives. Interventions that facilitate peer support and allow people with YOD to engage in meaningful activity should be developed and could perhaps be provided by the voluntary sector.",

     "abstract": "Pituitary incidentalomas are lesions which are detected incidentally in the pituitary gland during imaging procedures for unrelated causes, such as headache, trauma or symptoms involving the neck or central nervous system. The wide application of sensitive brain imaging techniques (CT, MRI) has led to an increasing recognition of such lesions. Although the etiology of pituitary incidentalomas covers a wide range of pathologies, most of them (\u223c90%) are benign adenomas; nonetheless, they may result in visual and/or neurologic abnormalities. By definition, micro-incidentalomas have maximum diameter of less than 1\u00a0cm, while macro-incidentalomas are at least 1\u00a0cm. Micro-incidentalomas have a reported mean prevalence in normal individuals of around 10%. The endocrinologist facing a pituitary incidentaloma has to solve two main diagnostic problems: (i) the nature and extent of the lesion, and (ii) whether hormonal excess or deficits result from the lesion. The former is achieved by the use of pituitary MRI and visual field (VF) examination and the latter by basal or dynamic hormonal assessments. The answers to these two questions will guide the treatment and follow-up. VF deficits or neurological disturbances due to compression of the optic chiasm or nerve by the incidentaloma are the strongest recommendations for surgery. Furthermore, hormonally active incidentalomas, with the exception of prolactinomas, should be treated by surgery. Most cases of pituitary incidentalomas do not meet criteria for surgical excision, but may require follow-up. The follow-up strategy consists of clinical evaluation, pituitary MRI, VF examination and hormonal assessments. Macro-incidentalomas require more extensive initial investigation, as well as closer MRI surveillance, than micro-incidentalomas. Diagnostic, treatment and follow-up strategies should be in alignment with the optimal personalized clinical benefit.",

Participants were 351 community-dwelling women free of major depression going through the MT, of whom 180 were assigned the intervention and 171 usual care. The primary outcome of interest was the incidence of clinically significant depressive symptoms over 52 weeks. Other study measures included the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, quality of life (SF-12), the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), diet, body mass index, alcohol use, smoking and physical activity. We considered that women with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores between 5 and 14 (inclusive) had sub-threshold depressive symptoms.Nine women developed clinically significant symptoms of depression during the study\u20142 had been assigned HC (odds ratio, OR\u00a0=\u00a00.26, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.05, 1.29; p\u00a0=\u00a00.099). Intention-to-treat showed that, compared with usual care, the intervention led to a greater decline in depressive scores, most markedly for participants with sub-threshold depressive symptoms. Similar, but less pronounced, benefits were noticed for anxiety scores and the mental component summary of the SF-12. The intervention led to a decline in MRS scores by week 26 and subtle improvements in body mass, consumption of vegetables and smoking.HC addressing relevant risk factors for depression during the MT improves mental health measures. Our findings indicate that women with sub-threshold depressive symptoms may benefit the most from such interventions, and suggest that HC could play a useful role in minimizing mental health disturbance for women going through the MT.",

Targeted and broad spectrum metabolomics analysis was used to compare ovarian tissue and serum from monkeys that had been exposed to a prudent diet or a Western diet. Monkeys in the prudent diet group (n\u00a0=\u00a013) were research na\u00efve and had been exposed only to a commercial monkey chow diet (low in cholesterol and saturated fats, high in complex carbohydrates). Western diet monkeys (n\u00a0=\u00a08) had consumed a diet that was high in cholesterol, saturated animal fats and soluble carbohydrates for 2 years prior to ovarian tissue and serum collection.Metabolomic analyses were done on extracts of homogenized ovary tissue samples, and extracts of serum. Targeted analysis was conducted using the Biocrates p180 kit and broad spectrum analysis was conducted using UPLC-TOF-MS, resulting in the detection of 3500 compound ions.Using metabolomics methods, which capture thousands of signals for metabolites, 64 metabolites were identified in serum and 47 metabolites were identified in ovarian tissue that differed by diet. Quantitative targeted analysis revealed 13 amino acids, 6 acrylcarnitines, and 2 biogenic amines that were significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) different between the two diet groups for serum extracts, and similar results were observed for the ovary extracts.These data demonstrate that dietary exposure had a significant impact on the serum and ovarian metabolome, and demonstrated perturbation in carnitine, lipids/fatty acid, and amino acid metabolic pathways.",

The aim of this paper is to describe the characteristics of contributing studies and to present the distribution of demographic and reproductive factors and chronic disease outcomes in InterLACE.InterLACE is an individual-level pooled study of 20 observational studies (12 of which are longitudinal) from ten countries. Variables were harmonized across studies to create a new and systematic synthesis of life-course data.Harmonized data were derived in three domains: 1) socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, 2) female reproductive characteristics, and 3) chronic disease outcomes (cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes).InterLACE pooled data from 229,054 mid-aged women. Overall, 76% of the women were Caucasian and 22% Japanese; other ethnicities (of 300 or more participants) included Hispanic/Latin American (0.2%), Chinese (0.2%), Middle Eastern (0.3%), African/black (0.5%), and Other (1.0%). The median age at baseline was 47 years (Inter-quartile range (IQR): 41\u201353), and that at the last follow-up was 56 years (IQR: 48\u201364). Regarding reproductive characteristics, half of the women (49.8%) had their first menstruation (menarche) at 12\u201313 years of age. The distribution of menopausal status and the prevalence of chronic disease varied considerably among studies. At baseline, most women (57%) were pre- or peri-menopausal, 20% reported a natural menopause (range 0.8\u201355.6%) and the remainder had surgery or were taking hormones. By the end of follow-up, the prevalence rates of CVD and diabetes were 7.2% (range 0.9\u201324.6%) and 5.1% (range 1.3\u201313.2%), respectively.The scale and heterogeneity of InterLACE data provide an opportunity to strengthen evidence concerning the relationships between reproductive health through life and subsequent risks of chronic disease, including cross-cultural comparisons.",

A cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) intervention has been developed specifically for HFNS that is theoretically based and shown to reduce significantly the impact of HFNS in several randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Self-help CBT has been found to be as effective as group CBT for these symptoms, but these interventions are not widely available in the workplace. This paper describes the protocol of an RCT aiming to assess the efficacy of CBT for menopausal symptoms implemented in the workplace, with a nested qualitative study to examine acceptability and feasibility.One hundred menopausal working women, aged 45\u201360 years, experiencing bothersome HFNS for two months will be recruited from several (2\u201310) large organisations into a multicentre randomised controlled trial. Women will be randomly assigned to either treatment (a self-help CBT intervention lasting 4 weeks) or to a no treatment-wait control condition (NTWC), following a screening interview, consent, and completion of a baseline questionnaire. All participants will complete follow-up questionnaires at 6 weeks and 20 weeks post-randomisation. The primary outcome is the rating of HFNS; secondary measures include HFNS frequency, mood, quality of life, attitudes to menopause, HFNS beliefs and behaviours, work absence and presenteeism, job satisfaction, job stress, job performance, disclosure to managers and turnover intention. Adherence, acceptability and feasibility will be assessed at 20 weeks post-randomisation in questionnaires and qualitative interviews. Upon trial completion, the control group will also be offered the intervention.This is the first randomised controlled trial of a self-management intervention tailored for working women who have troublesome menopausal symptoms.Clin.Gov NCT02623374.",

Vaginal microbiota are of particular significance to postmenopausal women and may have a profound effect on vulvovaginal atrophy, vaginal dryness, sexual health and overall quality of life. As molecular-based techniques have evolved, our understanding of the diversity and complexity of this bacterial community has expanded. The objective of this review is to compare the changes that have been identified in the vaginal microbiota of menopausal women, outline alterations in the microbiome associated with specific menopausal symptoms, and define how hormone replacement therapy impacts the vaginal microbiome and menopausal symptoms; it concludes by considering the potential of probiotics to reinstate vaginal homeostasis following menopause. This review details the studies that support the role of Lactobacillus species in maintaining vaginal homeostasis and how the vaginal microbiome structure in postmenopausal women changes with decreasing levels of circulating estrogen. In addition, the associated transformations in the microanatomical features of the vaginal epithelium that can lead to vaginal symptoms associated with menopause are described. Furthermore, hormone replacement therapy directly influences the dominance of Lactobacillus in the microbiota and can resolve vaginal symptoms. Oral and vaginal probiotics hold great promise and initial studies complement the findings of previous research efforts concerning menopause and the vaginal microbiome; however, additional trials are required to determine the efficacy of bacterial therapeutics to modulate or restore vaginal homeostasis.",

This systematic review examines the impact of ACP on several outcomes (including symptom management, quality of care and healthcare utilisation) in older adults (>65\u00a0years) across all healthcare settings. Nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by searches of the CINAHL, PubMed and Cochrane databases. A total of 3646 older adults were included (range 72\u201388 years). Seven studies were conducted with community dwellers and the other two RCTs were conducted in nursing homes. Most studies did not implement a standardised ACD, or measure the impact on quality of end-of-life care or on the death and dying experience. All studies had some risk of bias, with most scoring poorly on the Oxford Quality Scale. While ACP interventions are well received by older adults and generally have positive effects on outcomes, this review highlights the need for well-designed RCTs that examine the economic impact of ACP and its effect on quality of care in nursing homes and other sectors.",

The use of medications is particularly important for symptom control and disease progression in older people. Under-treatment means older people can miss out on the potential benefits of useful medications, while over-treatment (polypharmacy) puts them at increased risk of harm. Deprescribing attempts to balance the potential for benefit and harm by systematically withdrawing inappropriate medications with the goal of managing polypharmacy and improving outcomes. The evidence base for deprescribing in older people is growing. Studies to reduce polypharmacy have used a range of methods. Most evidence for deprescribing relates to the withdrawal of specific medications, and evidence supports attempts to deprescribe potentially inappropriate medicines (such as long-term benzodiazepines). There is also evidence that polypharmacy can be reduced by withdrawing specific medications using individualised interventions. More work is needed to identify the sub-groups of older people who may most benefit from deprescribing and the best approaches to undertaking the deprescribing interventions.",

Of 1236 women surveyed, 1196 eligible participants who were not under treatment for menopausal symptoms were included.Main outcome measures: Participants were presented with a vignette describing a woman with menopausal symptoms and were then asked a series of questions to assess their recognition of menopausal symptoms, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavior control, availability, and intention to seek medical care if they themselves had the problems described in the vignette.The majority (87%) of participants correctly labelled the vignette as menopausal symptoms and 60% expressed an intention to seek medical care if they had the symptoms presented. Logistic regression showed that attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavior control were significant predictors of the intention to seek medical care.

Usually, the severity of symptoms was similar to or worse than when they first appeared. This was particularly true for dyspareunia, the most bothersome symptom (76%). VVA symptoms had a significant impact on Italian participants\u2019 ability to achieve pleasurable relations (74%) and spontaneity (70%). Although 75% of participants were still sexually active, their sex drive had been reduced by a third because of VVA. Women expected that doctors would start a discussion of menopausal symptoms and sexual health, but this was rarely the case (11%). Most women had been treated with a vaginal over-the-counter (OTC) product. Women who had discussed their condition with a physician were more likely (68%) to be under treatment for VVA than those who had not (36%). Low compliance was associated with symptom improvement (23%), not having annoying symptoms (22%), and the impossibility if restoring the vagina to normal (14%). Common reasons for treatment dissatisfaction were related to route of administration or discomfort. Lack of efficacy and fear of a hormone effect were perceived as the main limitations for OTC and local estrogen products, respectively.Despite the commonness of VVA and its significant impact on quality of life, the condition remains underdiagnosed in Italy. Discussion of symptoms with doctors influences the diagnosis, and patients\u2019 satisfaction with available treatments is not high.",

The most common menopausal symptom was vaginal/vulvar dryness, with almost 80% of participants reporting it in all the countries except the UK (48%). On the other hand, vaginal/vulvar irritation was more frequently reported in the UK (41%). The percentage of participants with a partner was lower in the UK (71%), as was the monthly rate of sexual activity (49%).

In this sense, UK PMW waited for a longer before asking for help (especially for pain with intercourse and dryness). The main issues relating to VVA treatment difficulties expressed by participants were administration route in the UK, efficacy in Germany, and side-effects in Italy.Although all European women shared the same expectation of improving the quality of their sex lives, the opportunity for that varied among different countries in relation to the healthcare system and to the effective communication achieved with healthcare professionals when managing VVA.",

The safety of increasing doses of E4 and its preliminary effects on the vagina, endometrium and menopausal vasomotor symptoms were investigated.This was a partly randomized, open-label, multiple-rising-dose study in 49 postmenopausal women. Subjects with an intact uterus were randomized to receive either 2\u00a0mg E4 or 2\u00a0mg estradiol-valerate (E2V) for 28\u00a0days. Subsequent dose-escalation groups (non-randomized) were: 10\u00a0mg E4 (intact uterus and \u226535 hot flushes/week); and 20\u00a0mg and 40\u00a0mg E4 (hysterectomized subjects).Adverse events (AEs) and vaginal cytology were evaluated in all treatment groups; hot flushes/sweating and endometrial proliferation were analyzed with 2 and 10\u00a0mg E4 and 2\u00a0mg E2V.Estetrol appeared to be safe, without serious drug-related AEs. In all the groups there was a clear shift from parabasal to superficial vaginal cells, indicating an estrogenic effect and a potential for the treatment of vulvovaginal atrophy. The endometrial thickness remained stable in the 2\u00a0mg E4 group and increased with E2V and 10\u00a0mg E4. A decrease in the mean number of hot flushes and sweating was seen with 2 and 10\u00a0mg E4 and 2\u00a0mg E2V.Estetrol in a dose range of 2\u201340\u00a0mg per day improved vaginal cytology and vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. Endometrial proliferation occurred with the 10\u00a0mg dose. Estetrol seems a safe and suitable candidate to develop further for hormone therapy.",

     "abstract": "Given the global increase in the number of people over the age of 85, there is a growing body of work concerning this group, termed the oldest old. Much of this work is confined to the literature specialising in geriatrics and the more generic health care papers refer to \u2018older people\u2019 with little definition of what is meant by \u2018older\u2019. Iatrogenesis (ill health caused by doctors) is a major issue and general practitioners (GPs) need practical help in prescribing for the oldest old. This paper presents a narrative review of the literature on prescribing and the oldest old. The results showed that all papers sourced referred to prescribing for the \u2018old\u2019 as those aged over 65, with only scant mention of oldest old. Yet prescribing for the oldest old involves clinical judgement and knowledge of the patient. It includes weighing up what will do good, cause no harm and is acceptable to the individual. GPs have to make treatment choices mostly in isolation from colleagues, during time-limited consultations and with few relevant guidelines on managing multi-morbidities in the oldest old. A major issue in prescribing for people over the age of 85 is that guidelines for diseases are based on trials with younger adults, outline the best practice for one disease in isolation (i.e. not in the presence of other diseases) and take little account of the interactions between the drugs used in managing several diseases in frail older people. There is a growing body of work, however, calling for specialist services for the oldest old.",

It is therefore important to identify measures to ensure a healthy menopause. We set out to investigate the association between hypertension and early menopause in Korean women.This cross-sectional study was based on 2008\u20132013 data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). Of the 53,829 participants surveyed, 13,584 women were selected. We analyzed the contents of the health interview, health examination, and nutrition survey.The main outcome was defined based on hazard ratios (HR) to identify the effects of hypertension on age at onset of menopause.Among postmenopausal women (n\u00a0=\u00a06650), the mean age at onset of menopause was 50.4 years. Premenopausal hypertension was statistically significantly associated with age at menopause, oral contraceptive usage, household income, education level, occupation, marital status and smoking and drinking habits. With lower age at diagnosis of hypertension, HRs for menopause tended to be higher, and hypertension diagnosed before age 40 years conferred a statistically significantly higher HR (Model 1, HR\u00a0=\u00a02.32, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.87\u20132.88; Model 2, HR\u00a0=\u00a02.31, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.86\u20132.86; Model 3, HR\u00a0=\u00a02.23, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.80\u20132.77; Model 4, HR\u00a0=\u00a02.00, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.52\u20132.63).Premature menopause is strongly associated with lifestyle factors, in combination with incomplete management of chronic diseases.

A supplementary aim was to assess the use of opt-in internet opinion panels (TalkToChange, http://www.talktochange.com, and GMI, http://www.gmi-mr.com/global-panel) as a potential new way to obtain data on menopausal issues.Data were collected via an internet platform from 696 postmenopausal women aged 45\u201360 years.Respondents were asked questions about their socio-demographic profile, their experience of the menopause, the burden of the menopause, its impact on their quality of life and the treatment of menopausal symptoms (if any).The opt-in internet opinion panels proved a quick way (19\u00a0days) to obtain reliable information with a low error margin (3.7%). The online survey collected detailed socio-demographic data. Almost all of the women (98%) had heard about the menopause before. Sixty-one percent perceived the menopause as a temporary phase (17% thought it lasted for one or two years and 44% thought it lasted for three to five years) and only 39% realized the menopause would last for the rest of their life. Twenty-three percent of the women reported any kind of impact of the menopause on their quality of life. However, for the other 77% the menopause had resulted in complaints. No differences according to the women\u2019s age, level of education or professional status were found in this respect. Sixty-nine percent of the women had \u2018ever\u2019 used some type of treatment for menopausal symptoms and 53% were currently using a treatment. Forty percent of those with more than three symptoms were currently untreated. Of those who were not on hormone replacement therapy (HRT), 61% would not consider taking it (54% were \u2018strongly opposed\u2019 and 7% simply \u2018opposed\u2019), while 8% would consider asking their doctor for HRT. Among those women who were opposed to HRT, 25% indicated that they were afraid of the increased risk of breast cancer, 34% cited cardiovascular risks and 26% were worried about weight gain. In this Belgian sample, HRT was used significantly more often by French-speaking women (32%) than by Dutch-speaking women (9%) (OR 4.4, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The alternatives to HRT had a high satisfaction rate among users. Relaxation techniques, regular physical activity, acupuncture and avoiding stress had satisfaction rates similar to that with HRT. It was not possible to compare the alternatives in the same women. Nor was it possible to assess whether more pronounced symptoms required a specific treatment.Opt-in internet opinion panels proved a quick and efficient way to gather data on menopausal issues in Belgium. Despite the high levels of awareness and knowledge, there is some confusion concerning the duration of the menopause, and its common perception as a temporary condition is likely to mean that the menopausal burden is substantially underestimated.

Interestingly, increased levels of albumin and folic acid (FA) were associated with increased impairment of BI items.Anemia and lower levels of anemia related parameters showed a negative impact on ADL and physical performance based on BI items. An impaired total BI should result in an analysis of BI subitems, particularly if anemia related laboratory parameters are deviant.

Analyses were conducted on linked data from ALSWH surveys and the NSW Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC). Hospital costs were compared for the DM and non-DM cohorts of women. A generalized linear model measured the association between hospital costs and self-reported DM.Eight and a half year hospital costs were 41% higher for women who self-reported DM in the ALSWH surveys (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). On average, women who self-reported DM had significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) more hospital admissions (5.3) than women with no reported DM (3.4). The average hospital stay per admission was not significantly different between the two groups of women.Self-reported DM status in mid-aged Australian women is a predictor of higher hospital costs. This simple measure can be a useful indicator for public policy makers planning early-stage interventions that target people in the population at risk of DM.",

     "abstract": "This paper provides an up-to-date review of obesity and lower limb osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a major global cause of disability, with the knee being the most frequently affected joint. There is a proven association between obesity and knee OA, and obesity is suggested to be the main modifiable risk factor. Obese patients (Body Mass Index, BMI, over 30\u00a0kg/m2) are more likely to require total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The global prevalence of obesity has doubled since 1980; by 2025, 47% of UK men and 36% of women are forecast to be obese. This rising global burden is a key factor in the growing rise in the use of TKA. It is therefore important to appreciate the outcomes of surgery in patients with end-stage OA and a high BMI.This review found that while OA is felt to contribute to weight gain, it is unclear whether TKA facilitates weight reduction. Surgery in obese patients is more technically challenging. This is reflected in the evidence, which suggests higher rates of short- to medium-term complications following TKA, including wound infection and medical complications, resulting in longer hospital stay, and potentially higher rates of malalignment, dislocation, and early revision. However, despite slower initial recovery and possibly lower functional scores and implant survival in the longer term, obese patients can still benefit from TKA in terms of improved function, quality of life and satisfaction.In conclusion, despite higher risks and more uncertain outcomes of surgery, higher BMI in itself should not be a contraindication to TKA; instead, each patient\u2019s individual circumstances should be considered.",

Osteoporosis is site-specific in the Singapore population, being higher in the femoral neck than in the lumbar spine. The bone status after menopause may not be worse than that dictated by age alone and both ERT and E/PRT could sustain the BMD to levels corresponding to those of women a decade younger.

The aim of the present study was to combine an assessment of the relationship between the serum level of C-reactive protein (CRP) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 108 elderly women (65 and 70 years) with an in-vitro exploration of the effects of CRP on the proliferative and angiogenic potential of endothelial cells exposed to serum in elderly women. Based on the median CRP level in our population, LowCRP (CRP\u00a0<\u00a01.3\u00a0mg/L) and HighCRP (>1.3\u00a0mg/L) groups were identified. Body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly higher in the HighCRP group than in the LowCRP group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The influence of CRP on SBP and DBP remained significant after adjustments for BMI and use of antihypertensive medication (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). When adjusting for waist circumference the observed influence of CRP on SPB was attenuated (p\u00a0=\u00a00.062). We next evaluated the ability to form capillary tubes (angiogenesis assay) and the proliferation rate of endothelial cells exposed to the sera of elderly women. Increased serum CRP levels were associated with an increased doubling time of endothelial cells (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.39; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and decreased capillary tube length (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.30; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), indicating a reduction in the proliferation rate of endothelial cells and angiogenic potential. In conclusion, chronic inflammation influences blood pressure in elderly women and compromises endothelial cell function, thus contributing to the age-related decline in vascular health.",

We present a narrative literature review of 26 studies exploring the menopause transition in WLHIV, focusing on: (1) natural history (2) symptomatology and management, and (3) immunologic and virologic effects.Data are conflicting on the association between HIV and earlier age at menopause, and the role of HIV-specific factors such as HIV viral load and CD4 count. There are some data to suggest that WLHIV experience more vasomotor and psychological symptoms during the menopause than HIV-negative women, and that uptake of hormone replacement therapy by WLHIV is comparatively low. There is no evidence that menopause affects either CD4 count or response to ART, although there may be increased immune activation in older WLHIV.We conclude that menopause in WLHIV is a neglected area of study. Specific information gaps include qualitative studies on experiences of reproductive ageing; data on the impact of the menopause on women\u2019s quality of life and ability to adhere to health-sustaining behaviors; as well as studies investigating the safety and efficacy of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions.

AMD was inversely associated with the highest 25OHD quintile compared with the lowest (summary odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a00.83 [95%CI:0.71\u20130.97]), notably late AMD (summary OR\u00a0=\u00a00.47 [95%CI:0.28\u20130.79]). Circulating 25OHD\u00a0<\u00a050\u00a0nmol/L was also associated with late-stage AMD (summary OR\u00a0=\u00a02.18 [95%CI:1.34\u20133.56]), an association that did not persist when all categories of AMD were considered (summary OR\u00a0=\u00a01.26 [95%CI:0.90\u20131.76]). In conclusion, this meta-analysis provides evidence that high 25OHD concentrations may be protective against AMD, and that 25OHD concentrations below 50\u00a0nmol/L are associated with late AMD.",

A cluster of health behaviours, comorbidities and socioeconomic positions were also measured repeatedly. We assessed the phenotype\u2019s distribution non-parametrically, then fitted linear mixed models to phenotypic change and further examined time interactions with gender and socioeconomic position. We ran additional analyses to test robustness.Women had a wider distribution of the healthy ageing phenotype than men had. The phenotype declined annually by \u22120.242 (95% confidence interval [CI]: \u22120.352, \u22120.131). However, there was considerable heterogeneity in the levels and rates of phenotypic change. Women started at higher levels, then declined more steeply by \u22120.293 (CI: \u22120.403, \u22120.183) annually, leading to crossover in the trajectories. Smoking and physical activity assessed on the Allied Dunbar scale were strongly associated with the trajectories.Though marked by secular decline, the trajectories of the healthy ageing phenotype showed distinct socioeconomic gradients. The trajectories were also susceptible to variations in health behaviours, strengthening the case for serial interventions to attain healthy and active ageing.",

Patients with secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded.Osteoporosis was diagnosed in 30 (27%) women and osteopenia in 54 (49%). Serum leptin concentrations were positively correlated with both lumbar spine (r\u00a0=\u00a00.343, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and femoral neck BMD (r\u00a0=\u00a00.370, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

     "abstract": "High iron levels in women of post-reproductive age may be related to their increased risk of chronic disease as they become older, but the causes of this rise in iron in late life is unclear. Recently estrogen has been implicated in non-human models of iron homeostasis. Studying iron in women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may provide insight into the relationship between iron status and hormonal status in older women. This study examines the association between HRT and iron status in women aged 50+ who took part in the 1999\u20132000 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Data were analyzed using multiple imputation, which corrects for missing data, and complex survey regression, which adjusts for NHANES sampling. Current HRT use was associated with lower ferritin (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u221234.13, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002), controlling for potential breakthrough bleeding with a hysterectomy variable. HRT was associated with lower iron stores in women of post-reproductive in the absence of uterine blood loss, indicating potential homeostatic hormonal control of iron status. This research demonstrates the utility of studying clinical hormonal therapy to advance new understandings about the basic biology of iron homeostasis in women.",

It is not clear which anthropometric measures are best used to identify sarcopenic obesity. We therefore evaluated which anthropometric measures are differentially associated with FM and FFM.The anthropometric measures tested were body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and a body shape index (ABSI = WC/(BMI2/3*Height1/2)). FM and FFM were estimated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. An index-score was calculated for both FM (FMI) and FFM (FFMI) by dividing FM and FFM by height. Multivariable linear regression models were used to assess the associations of BMI, WC and ABSI with FMI and FFMI among 3612 participants (2092 women) from the prospective population-based Rotterdam Study.In multivariate models adjusted for confounders, BMI and WC were positively associated with both FMI and FFMI in men and women.

     "abstract": "The human menopause transition and aging are each associated with an increase in a variety of health risk factors including, but not limited to, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, cancer, diabetes, stroke, sexual dysfunction, affective disorders, sleep disturbances, and cognitive decline. It is challenging to systematically evaluate the biological underpinnings associated with the menopause transition in the human population. For this reason, rodent models have been invaluable tools for studying the impact of gonadal hormone fluctuations and eventual decline on a variety of body systems. While it is essential to keep in mind that some of the mechanisms associated with aging and the transition into a reproductively senescent state can differ when translating from one species to another, animal models provide researchers with opportunities to gain a fundamental understanding of the key elements underlying reproduction and aging processes, paving the way to explore novel pathways for intervention associated with known health risks. Here, we discuss the utility of several rodent models used in the laboratory for translational menopause research, examining the benefits and drawbacks in helping us to better understand aging and the menopause transition in women. The rodent models discussed are ovary-intact, ovariectomy, and 4-vinylcylohexene diepoxide for the menopause transition. We then describe how these models may be implemented in the laboratory, particularly in the context of cognition. Ultimately, we aim to use these animal models to elucidate novel perspectives and interventions for maintaining a high quality of life in women, and to potentially prevent or postpone the onset of negative health consequences associated with these significant life changes during aging.",

The aim of this review is (a) to define sexual function and dysfunction, (b) to present theoretical models of female sexual response, (c) to examine longitudinal studies of how sexual function changes during midlife, and (d) to review treatment options. Four types of female sexual dysfunction are currently recognized: Female Orgasmic Disorder, Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder, Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder, and Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction. However, optimal sexual function transcends the simple absence of dysfunction. A biopsychosocial approach that simultaneously considers physical, psychological, sociocultural, and interpersonal factors is necessary to guide research and clinical care regarding women\u2019s sexual function. Most longitudinal studies reveal an association between advancing menopause status and worsening sexual function. Psychosocial variables, such as availability of a partner, relationship quality, and psychological functioning, also play an integral role. Future directions for research should include deepening our understanding of how sexual function changes with aging and developing safe and effective approaches to optimizing women\u2019s sexual function with aging. Overall, holistic, biopsychosocial approaches to women\u2019s sexual function are necessary to fully understand and treat this key component of midlife women\u2019s well-being.",

Aging is accompanied by changes that can increase the risks associated with the use of combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs), but we do not have sufficient evidence to determine whether age alone increases the risks of using CHCs or whether there are additional risks if CHC use begins at an earlier age. Another issue is whether we can differentiate between initiator versus continuation influences on risk. The objective of this article is to review the risks associated with CHC to determine whether there is a need for more appropriate contraceptive counseling for women aged over 40.",

     "abstract": "Age at the final menstrual period is of clinical and public health interest because the age at which natural menopause occurs may be a marker of ageing and health, and in general the menopausal transition increases the risk of many diseases, e.g. redistribution in the pattern of adiposity during the menopausal transition may increase risk of metabolic disease. The purpose of this research was to study the relationship between the menopausal status and body fatness.A random sample of 1932Hungarian women was studied. Body composition was estimated by body impedance analysis. In a subsample free estradiol and progesterone levels in saliva were quantified.Body fat mass increased until the late 50s and then had a decrease through senescence. Premenopausal women who were much older than the median age at menopause had a higher amount of fat than their postmenopausal age-peers, while postmenopausal women, whose menopause occurred much earlier than the median age at menopause, had less fat than their premenopausal age-peers. The body fat mass in premenopausal women with low levels of sex hormones was always below the age-median value of the menopausal status subgroups, while the body fat mass of postmenopausal women with high levels of sex hormone levels was above the age-median values.The analysis of body fatness in the menopausal transition revealed that (1) the rate of reproductive ageing and the body fat pattern were significantly related, and (2) body fat mass of women with unexpected levels of sex hormones was related more to their hormonal levels than to their menopausal status or their age. Thus future epidemiological screenings of women exposed to higher levels of menopause-related health risks should be expanded beyond the estimation of menopausal status based only on menstrual history to include sex hormone level assessment, as well as body composition analysis.",

Their results on the Menopause Rating Scale were used to assess VMS, and moderate, severe, and very severe VMS were combined into moderate-to-severe VMS.The relationships of VMS with BMD and osteoporosis in the lumbar spine and femoral neck bone were analyzed by multivariate regression analyses.The mean age of all participants was 54.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.78\u00a0years. Four hundred seventy-one (33.9%) women reported mild VMS and 344 (24.7%) reported moderate-to-severe VMS. Osteoporosis was newly diagnosed in 156 (11.2%) women. BMD levels were not significantly different among the no/mild/moderate-to-severe VMS groups, despite the significant differences in the prevalence of osteoporosis in the femoral neck bone. Women with mild VMS and those with moderate-to-severe VMS had a lower BMD than women without VMS after adjustment for age, years since menopause, years of reproductive age, BMI, insulin resistance, smoking, alcohol, steroids use, exercise, previous fracture and parental history of hip fracture. And moderate-to-severe VMS was significantly associated with the risk of osteoporosis in the femoral neck bone (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.97, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.41\u20136.26) and in the lumbar spine (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.93, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.09\u20133.40).VMS are associated with decreased BMD, and moderate-to-severe VMS in particular are independently associated with the risk of osteoporosis in otherwise healthy postmenopausal Korean women.",

Results were adjusted for demographic and health covariates.Retirement is associated with physical dysfunction over time. Retirement is not associated with psychological distress among women, but retirement is associated with psychological distress among men who have a high level of physical dysfunction. The findings point to the importance of attending to the physical and mental health needs, around the retirement period, particularly for men with poor physical health.",

Frailty has been measured in several ethnic groups, but not, to our knowledge, in Aboriginal Australians. We aimed to determine the prevalence and incidence of frailty, and associations with mortality and disability, in remote-living Aboriginal people.Between 2004 and 2006, we recruited 363 Aboriginal people aged \u226545 years from 6 remote communities and one town in the Kimberley region of Western Australia (wave 1). Between 2011 and 2013, 182 surviving participants were followed-up (wave 2). We assessed frailty with an index, comprising 20 health-related items. Participants with \u22654 deficits (frailty index \u22650.2) were considered frail. Disability was assessed by family/carer report. Those unable to do \u22652 of 6 key or instrumental activities of daily living were considered disabled. We investigated associations between frailty, and disability and mortality, with logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models.At wave 1 (W1), 188 participants (65.3%) were frail, and of robust people at W1 who participated in wave 2, 38 (51.4%) had become frail. Frailty emerged at a younger age than expected. A total of 109 people died (30.0%), of whom 80 (73.4%) were frail at W1. Frailty at W1 was not associated with becoming disabled, but was associated with mortality (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.9; 95% CI 1.2, 3.0).Frailty in remote-living Aboriginal Australians is highly prevalent; substantially higher than in other populations. Research to understand the underlying causes of frailty in this population, and if possible, reverse frailty, is urgently needed.",

     "abstract": "The discovery of the OPG/RANK/RANKL pathway two decades ago has initiated novel insights into regulation of bone formation. More recently this pathway has been found to be also relevant in osteoclastic-independent mechanisms, mainly in mammary physiology and breast cancer. RANKL/RANK function is essential for epithelial cell proliferation and cellular survival as well as lobulo-alveolar development. The endogenous OPG functions as a soluble decoy receptor, binding the cytokine RANKL to prevent RANKL from activating its receptor RANK. The regulatory function of RANKL is one of the key factors in progesterone-induced proliferation of the breast. Progesterone has a direct action of progesterone on progesterone-receptor (PR) expressing cells but PR-negative cells are affected indirectly through RANKL-induced paracrine actions leading to proliferation of mammary epithelial PR-negative cells. RANK induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition and stemness in human mammary epithelial cells and promotes tumorigenesis and metastasis. Inhibition of the RANK/RANKL pathway using the monoclonal antibody denosumab can neutralize RANKL and inhibiting its interaction with its receptor RANK. Denosumab is currently used to treat osteoporosis and in prevention of skeletal related events in patients suffering from bone metastases due to solid tumors. As preclinical experiments suggest the RANKL/RANK pathway plays an important role in primary breast cancer development. The interference with the RANK/RANKL system could therefore serve as a potential target for prevention and treatment of breast cancer.",

ER\u03b2 signaling was shown to possess vasodilator and antiangiogenic properties by regulating the activity of nitric oxide, altering membrane ionic permeability in vascular smooth muscle cells, inhibiting vascular smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation and by regulating adrenergic control of the arteries. Also, a possible protective effect of ER\u03b2 signaling against left ventricular hypertrophy and ischemia/reperfusion injury via genomic and non-genomic pathways was suggested in 27 studies. Moreover, 5 studies reported that the vascular effects of ER\u03b2 may be vessel specific and may differ by age and menopause status.

Men with \u2018current depression\u2019 scored 7 or more on the abbreviated Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), whereas men with \u2018ever depression\u2019 were either currently depressed or reported history or treatment for past depression. The presence of diabetes was established by self-reported history, fasting glucose \u22657\u00a0mmol/L (126\u00a0mg/dL), or use of insulin or hypoglycemic drugs. Duration of diabetes relied on self-report. Other measured factors included age, place of birth, education, smoking history, and the FRAIL scale.Diabetes was associated with increased odds ratio (OR) of ever (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.49, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.25, 1.76) and current depression (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.94, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.15, 2.48). The association between duration of diabetes and risk of current depression was \u2018J-shaped\u2019 with odds ratios of 1.92 (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.44, 2.54), 1.56 (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 2.75), 2.49 (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.16, 5.32) and 3.13 (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.28, 7.63) for <10, 10\u201319.9, 20\u201329.9 and \u226530 years of diabetes history compared with older men without diabetes. The strength of these associations was attenuated after the analyses were adjusted for other measured factors, but the shape of the curve did not change. Structural equation modeling showed that frailty mediated some of the association between diabetes duration and depression (about 15%) and was a strong predictor of depression in the sample.In older men, the association between time lived with the diagnosis of diabetes and the risk of depression is \u2018J-shaped\u2019. Frailty mediates some of the association between diabetes and depression, although other unmeasured factors are also likely to play a role. The introduction of strategies that are effective at decreasing diabetes-related complications may also contribute to decrease the risk of depression among older men.",

Climacteric symptoms were evaluated using the Women\u2019s Health Questionnaire (WHQ), of which we included seven symptom domains (vasomotor, sleep, depressive, anxiety/fears, cognitive, sexual, and menstrual) and a question concerning whether the women were worried about growing old. The occurrence of various diseases (cardiovascular, neurological, sensory organ, bronchopulmonary, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, urological, dermatological, and thyroid disease, diabetes, and cancer) was recorded. The associations between the diseases and symptoms were defined with multivariable analyses, adjusting for various confounding factors.The women with the diseases had more symptoms. Vasomotor symptoms and sleep problems were associated only with gastrointestinal diseases, and lower sexual functioning only with diabetes. The remaining symptoms were associated with several diseases, except being worried about growing old, which was not associated with any.Many symptoms connected to the climacteric may manifest also due to chronic diseases. Thus, health-care professionals should consider the origin of the symptoms when treating middle-aged women with chronic diseases.",

The Cochrane criteria were used to assess the risk of bias for the individual studies. All randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of DSS or modified DSS were included. Data from all articles were extracted by two independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was used to pool the data. A total of 746 potentially relevant studies were identified, and four RCTs met our inclusion criteria. All of the included RCTs had a high risk of bias across their domains. Three RCTs showed favourable effects of DSS on response rate compared with conventional medicine, and a meta-analysis showed that DSS had superior effects compared to analgesics (RR: 1.31, 95%CI, 1.06\u20131.63, I2\u00a0=\u00a073%). One RCT showed a beneficial effect of DSS on pain compared with placebo control.

A bibliographic search was performed in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Opengrey and Scopus. The search included all publications up to and including 4th February 2015, with no specific start date specified. Studies concerning ADRs in elderly patients with cognitive disorders or dementia were included. Two senior authors identified eligible studies and extracted data independently. In total, 113 studies were identified by the bibliographic search, of which six full-text articles were retained and analyzed. Prevalence of ADRs ranged from 4.8 to 37%. The main ADRs reported were neurological and psychological disorders, gastro-intestinal disorders, dermatological and allergic disorders, falls, renal and urinary disorders, cardiovascular disorders, metabolic disorders and electrolyte imbalance, and hemorrhagic events. The medications most commonly suspected of involvement in the ADRs were drugs affecting the nervous system, cardiovascular drugs, anticoagulants, and painkillers.

     "abstract": "Large numbers of women transition through menopause whilst in paid employment. Symptoms associated with menopause may cause difficulties for working women, especially if untreated, yet employers are practically silent on this potentially costly issue. This review summarises existing research on the underexplored topic of menopause in the workplace, and synthesises recommendations for employers. Longstanding scholarly interest in the relationship between employment status and symptom reporting typically (but not consistently) shows that women in paid employment (and in specific occupations) report fewer and less severe symptoms than those who are unemployed. Recent studies more systematically focused on the effects of menopausal symptoms on work are typically cross-sectional self-report surveys, with a small number of qualitative studies. Though several papers established that vasomotor (and associated) symptoms have a negative impact on women\u2019s productivity, capacity to work and work experience, this is not a uniform finding. Psychological and other somatic symptoms associated with menopause can have a relatively greater negative influence. Physical (e.g., workplace temperature and design) and psychosocial (e.g., work stress, perceptions of control/autonomy) workplace factors have been found to influence the relationship between symptoms and work. Principal recommendations for employers to best support menopausal women as part of a holistic approach to employee health and well-being include risk assessments to make suitable adjustments to the physical and psychosocial work environment, provision of information and support, and training for line managers. Limitations of prior studies, and directions for future research are presented.",

     "abstract": "Cancer-related fatigue has a multidimensional nature and complaints typically increase during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Physical exercise might prevent or reduce cancer-related fatigue. So far, no meta-analysis has investigated the effects of physical exercise on different dimensions of fatigue. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of physical exercise during adjuvant breast cancer treatment on physical and psychosocial dimensions of fatigue. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library in June 2015. Randomised controlled trials reporting the effects of physical exercise during adjuvant breast cancer treatment on different dimensions of fatigue were included. Pooled effects of 6 exercise programmes (including 784 patients) showed significant beneficial exercise effects on general fatigue (ES: \u22120.22, 95% CI \u22120.38; \u22120.05) and physical fatigue (ES: \u22120.35, 95% CI \u22120.49; \u22120.21). Effects on fatigue subscales \u2018reduced activity\u2019 (ES: \u22120.22, 95% CI \u22120.38; \u22120.05) and \u2018reduced motivation\u2019 (ES: \u22120.18, 95% CI \u22120.35; \u22120.01) were also in favour of physical exercise. No effects were found on cognitive and affective fatigue. Including only the supervised exercise programmes (n\u00a0=\u00a04 studies), slightly larger pooled effect estimates were found on general fatigue (ES: \u22120.25, 95% CI \u22120.47; \u22120.04) and physical fatigue (\u22120.39, 95% CI \u22120.56; \u22120.23). In conclusion, physical exercise during adjuvant breast cancer treatment has beneficial effects on general fatigue, physical fatigue, \u2018reduced activity\u2019 and \u2018reduced motivation\u2019, but did not show effects on cognitive and affective fatigue. Largest effect sizes are found for physical fatigue, suggesting that this is the fatigue dimension most sensitive to physical exercise.",

A growing body of research supports the role of reproductive hormones, specifically estrogen, in the risk for eating disorders and related symptomatology in adolescence and young adulthood. Like puberty, perimenopause is characterized by estrogen change and may also present a window of vulnerability to eating disorder development. Here, we discuss the evidence that suggests perimenopause indeed may be a vulnerable period for the development or redevelopment of an eating disorder for midlife women. Drawing from what is known about the influence of estrogen on eating disorders at younger ages and from other psychiatric disorders with similar risk trajectories (i.e., perimenopausal depression), we describe a potential mechanism of risk for a perimenopausal eating disorder and how this can be explored in future research. Investigating vulnerability to perimenopausal eating disorders will clarify eating disorder etiology, identify reproductive stage-specific risk profiles, and guide future treatment directions.",

This systematic review synthesises findings from research on social support interventions, and examines their methodological quality and effectiveness on caregiver social support and well-being variables.A systematic literature search utilised five databases. Papers were selected when the primary aim of the intervention was to improve social support. Quality of papers was assessed by the Level of Evidence grade and the criteria list from the Cochrane Back Review Group.39 papers were identified and classified into 4 social support intervention categories: befriending and peer support, family support and social network interventions, support groups, and remote interventions using the internet or telephone. Content, intensity, uptake, effectiveness and quality of interventions varied widely. In general, the level of evidence was low. Most studies measured effect on well-being variables, while few examined social support outcomes. Multi-component social support interventions were most effective. Evidence suggested, also a caregiver benefit from remote interventions. Generally, results were inconsistent; some papers demonstrated beneficial results, while others demonstrated no improvement on social support and well-being variables. Social support outcomes were more positively evaluated when qualitative outcome measures rather than quantitative measures were used.Although multi-component social support interventionsmay improve caregiver well-being, there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether a change in social support is the underlying mediating factor. The inclusion, validation and operationalization of caregiver social support measures deserve more attention.",

Isolates were assembled into three phylogenetic groups from ST-19, ST-23 and ST-17 founders. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, whereas resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin was recorded in 23.4% and 20.6% of isolates, respectively.In our setting, the GBS colonization rate in postmenopausal women is similar to that reported in others populations studied. The population structure of these isolates is highly diverse and contains different STs. These data can contribute to the future development of a polysaccharide vaccine for preventing GBS infection in older adults.",

A history of falls or of multiple fractures increased risk calculated by Garvan 3\u20136-fold, but did not account for all differences between calculators. Discrepancies around a 3% treatment threshold occurred in 31/122 (25%). Women aged 70\u201374 years, and women with osteopenia were most likely to have discordant estimates. Most discordant estimates (29/31) had a Garvan estimate \u22653% and FRAX\u2009<3%. Falls, multiple fractures, ethnicity and a history of parental hip fracture contributed to some discordant estimates.Hip fracture risk estimates are usually higher with Garvan than FRAX, and these differences could impact on treatment decisions in about a quarter of patients. Falls and multiple fractures have a strong influence on Garvan risk estimates, when present. Clinically important discrepancies tend to occur in patients who are at borderline fracture risk. In patients with hip fracture risks near the treatment threshold with one calculator, use of the other calculator should be considered to help guide treatment decisions.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the expression and activity of aromatase, a key enzyme in local production of estrogens, in human OA cultured articular chondrocytes, and to determine the physiological relevance of this enzyme in cartilage.Human OA articular chondrocytes were isolated and cultured. Local production of estradiol was measured after incubation with 100ng/ml testosterone for 8 and 24\u00a0h. Furthermore, chondrocytes were culture for 2\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h, 7 days or 15 days, or in alginate beads for 10 days. Aromatase, type II and X collagen, aggrecan, alkaline phosphatase, and Runx2 expression were evaluated in cartilage, freshly isolated chondrocytes and cultured chondrocytes.Aromatase was expressed and active in cultured human chondrocytes. Human cartilage, freshly isolated chondrocytes, and chondrocytes cultured for 2\u00a0h expressed an insignificant amount of aromatase; however, expression arose after 48\u00a0h of culture and remained increased thereafter. Aromatase expression was not related to estrogen deprivation and was inversely correlated with differentiation. Re-differentiation did not reduce its expression.Aromatase presents an almost undetectable expression in human cartilage but is induced in cultured chondrocytes. Therefore, human cartilage might act as a mere target for estrogens rather than a producer, and researchers using cell expansion in culture for latter therapies should consider these changes in estrogen metabolism which may not be reverted after re-differentiation.",

Wrist fracture incidence in 1989\u20132004 was studied in a population of 5119 women.The adjusted spinal BMD (L2\u2013L4) changes by HT use during the entire 15-year follow-up were \u22124.8% for non-HT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), \u22124.2% for HT5 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), +0.02% for HT10 (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) and +3.2% for HT15 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) groups.

Thus, it reduces the incidence of osteopenia, osteoporosis and wrist fractures. Still, HT-use of less than 5 years did not have long-term bone protective effects, but a larger sample size is needed to confirm this result.",

This study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between lactation and the number of natural teeth in postmenopausal women using nationally representative data.The data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2010 and 2012 were used, and the analysis in this study was confined to 4211 respondents over 19 years old who had gone through menopause and had no missing values for the reproductive factors and outcome variables. The total number of natural teeth was then calculated after excluding third molars. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to assess the associations of the number of natural teeth and lactation.As the duration of total lactation increased, the number of natural teeth decreased. Average duration of lactation per child showed similar trends. The association between the total duration of lactation and the number of natural teeth showed an inverse relationship with a beta value of \u22120.0181 per day after adjustment, and the beta value of the average duration of lactation per child was \u22120.0287 after the adjustment.

Given the historical tendency to neglect the full rights and citizenship of people with dementia, such an emphasis gives hope and optimism that there is life after diagnosis. This paper seeks to explore the potential compromise of effective preparation for the complexities of advanced illness that may be presented by this consistently up-beat message. Dementia is a life limiting condition, currently without cure. Therefore, the appropriateness of palliative care may seem obvious. Yet, until relatively recently, palliative care was seen as an adjunct to oncology in the minds of professionals and public alike. However, there is a growing recognition that specialist palliative care has much to offer people with a range of long term conditions, including people with dementia. So, whilst \u2018living well\u2019 is an important message\u2014especially following diagnosis\u2014planning for advanced dementia and dying well is equally important. The aim of this paper is to highlight policy on the living well and the palliative care approach for people with dementia. A word limited narrative literature review was conducted to explore how policies have or have not informed the literature on both messages. The findings emphasise the need for a continuum approach to dementia care, with discussion on when, where, and how can palliative care be delivered for people with dementia.",

     "abstract": "Current knowledge on the effects of nut consumption on human health has rapidly increased in recent years and it now appears that nuts may play a role in the prevention of chronic age-related diseases. Frequent nut consumption has been associated with better metabolic status, decreased body weight as well as lower body weight gain over time and thus reduce the risk of obesity. The effect of nuts on glucose metabolism, blood lipids, and blood pressure is still controversial. However, significant decreased cardiovascular risk has been reported in a number of observational and clinical intervention studies. Thus, findings from cohort studies show that increased nut consumption is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality (especially that due to cardiovascular-related causes). Similarly, nut consumption has been also associated with reduced risk of certain cancers, such as colorectal, endometrial, and pancreatic neoplasms. Evidence regarding nut consumption and neurological or psychiatric disorders is scarce, but a number of studies suggest significant protective effects against depression, mild cognitive disorders and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The underlying mechanisms appear to include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, particularly related to their mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA and PUFA, as well as vitamin and polyphenol content). MUFA have been demonstrated to improve pancreatic beta-cell function and regulation of postprandial glycemia and insulin sensitivity. PUFA may act on the central nervous system protecting neuronal and cell-signaling function and maintenance. The fiber and mineral content of nuts may also confer health benefits. Nuts therefore show promise as useful adjuvants to prevent, delay or ameliorate a number of chronic conditions in older people. Their association with decreased mortality suggests a potential in reducing disease burden, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and cognitive impairments.",

Unfortunately, this raise in life span is accompanied by significant increase in disease burden, and consequent economical costs. Lifestyle modifications and effective prevention strategies have shown considerable benefits as regards the development of age-oriented chronic diseases. Among lifestyle factors, nutrition is a key component for achieving good health. Nevertheless, this parameter has insufficiently been investigated in older people. This is a rather important scientific gap, considering the westernization of nutritional habits observed the last few decades, with high red meat consumption and its processed products being an indispensable part. Moreover, its adverse impact in cardiovascular disease and cancer has been extensively investigated, while in recent literature, interest has been remarkably oriented towards its subtypes (i.e., fresh and processed); however, outcomes as regards the older population are controversial with a variety of them proposing moderation of red meat mainly the processed type, whilst others recognizing fresh red meat, especially the lean type, an important source of high quality protein so as to manage muscle tissue loss, a common implication of advanced-age discount. The aim of the present review was to present an overview of studies which have investigated the association between red meat and its subtypes, with chronic diseases, in middle and advanced age individuals.",

Among them, handling alpha-synuclein toxicity, enhancing proteasome and lysosome clearance, ameliorating mitochondrial disruptions and modifying the glial environment are so far the most promising candidates. These new and conventional drugs may present problems related to their labile nature and to the difficulties in reaching the brain.

     "abstract": "While the anticholinergic activity of medications has been linked to cognitive decline, few studies have linked anticholinergic burden with falls in older people. We evaluated the relationship between anticholinergic burden and recurrent and injurious falls among community-dwelling older adults.This case-control study was performed on 428 participants aged \u226565 years, 263 cases with two or more falls or one injurious fall in the preceding 12 months, and 165 controls with no falls in the preceding 12 months. Anticholinergic burden was determined using the anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB) scale. Upper and lower limb functional abilities were assessed with timed up and go (TUG), functional reach (FR) and grip strength (GS). Logistic regression analysis was employed to calculate the mediation effect of TUG, FR and GS on ACB associated falls.Univariate analysis revealed a significant association between an ACB score of \u22651 with falls (OR, 1.8; 95% CI; 1.1\u20133.0; p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and significantly poorer TUG and FR.

Conceptual model, burden of administration, feasibility, reliability, criteria validity and construct validity were assessed.317 women [55.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.3 years (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation)] were recruited: 75.4% were post- and 22.3% were peri-menopausal. The Cervantes-SF was completed in 2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6\u00a0min, and 86% answered all items. Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 was 0.820, and ranged from 0.510 (Aging) to 0.918 (Vasomotor Symptoms) for individual dimensions. The scale structure matched the structure of the original version, \u03c72/(degrees of freedom)\u00a0=\u00a03.6, Comparative Fit Index\u00a0=\u00a00.848, Tucker\u2013Lewis Index\u00a0=\u00a00.850, and root mean square error of approximation\u00a0=\u00a00.099, although differences were found between sexual activity statuses. Criteria validity was good (r\u00a0=\u00a00.890), concurrent validity was congruent with a priori hypothesis using either the EQ-5D or the WPAI scales. The scale discriminated significantly the severity of both vasomotor and genital climacteric associated symptoms.The Cervantes-SF has shown good psychometric properties for measuring Health related quality of life in peri- and post-menopausal women who regularly attended gynaecology clinics in Spain.",

Early-stage AMD was not associated with mortality risk.Late AMD independently predicted all-cause mortality in men and stroke mortality in women, over 15 years.

The study participants were randomly divided into one of two groups, receiving either a placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a030) or fennel 5% vaginal cream (n\u00a0=\u00a030) administered as one application per day (5\u00a0g/day) for 8 weeks.The vaginal pH and maturation vaginal index (MVI) were measured at baseline and 8 weeks after the intervention, while the vaginal atrophy symptoms was measured at baseline and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks after the intervention. The data were analyzed using the independent t-test, chi-square test, paired sample t-test, and the generalized estimating equation.The number of superficial cells increased significantly in the fennel group after 8 weeks compared to the control group (76.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.3 vs. 11.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The number of intermediate and parabasal cells decreased significantly in the fennel group compared to the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The vaginal pH decreased significantly at the 8-week follow-up in the fennel group compared to the control group (100% vs. 7.4%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

There are clinical and ethical challenges and practical problems around the implementation of good quality palliative care in dementia. This narrative review of the literature focuses on the rationale or basis for services, some of the ethical issues that arise (particularly to do with artificial nutrition and hydration) and on the provision and implementation of services. We focus on the most recent literature. The rationale for palliative care for people with dementia is based on research and on an identified need for better clinical care. But the research largely demonstrates a paucity of good quality evidence, albeit particular interventions (and non-interventions) can be justified in certain circumstances. Numerous specific clinical challenges in end-of-life care for people with dementia are ethical in nature. We focus on literature around artificial nutrition and hydration and conclude that good communication, attention to the evidence and keeping the well-being of the person with dementia firmly in mind will guide ethical decision-making. Numerous challenges surround the provision of palliative care for people with dementia. Palliative care in dementia has been given definition, but can still be contested. Different professionals provide services in different locations. More research and education are required. No single service can provide palliative care for people with dementia.",

Whether there is evidence for an effect of menopausal hormonal therapy on the incidence, prevalence or severity of symptomatic hand OA is critically reviewed, and gaps in our knowledge identified. Lastly, the potential mechanisms by which estrogen, or newer agents such as SERMs, might act to interfere with disease pathogenesis are overviewed.

     "abstract": "Worldwide, the prevalence of moderate to severe visual impairment and blindness is 285 millions, with 65% of visually impaired and 82% of all blind people being 50 years and older. Meta-analyses have shown that two out of three blind people are women, a gender discrepancy that holds true for both developed and developing countries. Cataract accounts for more than half of all blindness globally and gender inequity in access to cataract surgery is the major cause of the higher prevalence of blindness in women. In addition to gender differences in cataract surgical coverage, population-based studies on the prevalence of lens opacities indicate that women have a higher risk of developing cataract. Laboratory as well as epidemiologic studies suggest that estrogen may confer antioxidative protection against cataractogenesis, but the withdrawal effect of estrogen in menopause leads to increased risk of cataract in women. For the other major age-related eye diseases; glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy, data are inconclusive. Due to anatomic factors, angle closure glaucoma is more common in women, whereas the dominating glaucoma type; primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), is more prevalent in men. Diabetic retinopathy also has a male predominance and vascular/circulatory factors have been implied both in diabetic retinopathy and in POAG. For AMD, data on gender differences are conflicting although some studies indicate increased prevalence of drusen and neovascular AMD in women. To conclude, both biologic and socioeconomic factors must be considered when investigating causes of gender differences in the prevalence of age-related eye disease.",

We discuss a variety of interventions and approaches, including those that we have developed and applied in a clinic at our host university, which have generally produced successful outcomes. The extended focus to sexual relationship dynamics in partners of men with either prostate cancer or ED in particular is virtually unexplored, yet is especially timely given the large numbers of women who encounter this situation.

However, no significant changes in weight status were evident in either group at 12 months compared with baseline. The 3-month intensive intervention resulted in significantly improved psychological functioning in both groups, which were maintained at 12 months. The study provides additional support for a non-dieting, theory-based, lifestyle approach to weight management and psychological well-being among morbidly obese females.",

Low body mass index (BMI) has been proposed as one of the major risk factors for osteoporosis. This study sought to compare the predictive performance of BMI alone with 5 screening modalities (the U.S. Preventive services task force [USPSTF] FRAX threshold of 9.3%, a risk factor based approach [\u22651 risk factors], the osteoporosis self-assessment tool [OST <2], the osteoporosis risk assessment instrument [ORAI \u22659], and the simple calculated osteoporosis risk estimation [SCORE \u22656]) in identifying early postmenopausal women with osteoporosis.Postmenopausal women aged 50\u201364 years presenting for a DXA test were recruited between January 1, 2007, and March 1, 2009. Demographic data and osteoporosis risk factors were obtained through a telephone survey. The performance of each screening tool in predicting osteoporosis was compared.Of 445 study participants, 95% were White, 38 had osteoporosis (T-score \u2264\u22122.5). BMI (<28) was associated with the highest Sensitivity (95%), the lowest Negative Likelihood Ratio (LR-) of 0.14, an AUC of 0.73, and the number needed to scan (NNS) of 8. The USPSTF approach had the lowest sensitivity (24%), highest LR- (0.91), lowest AUC (0.62), and highest NNS (9). Among 5 established modalities, SCORE (\u22656) appears to be the best (sensitivity: 92%, LR-: 0.24, AUC: 0.75, NNS: 9).BMI (<28) had a comparable numerical screening performance overall to the current screening modalities. BMI (<28) could be considered a potential indicator when screening early postmenopausal White women for osteoporosis. However, a better osteoporosis screening tool remains to be developed.",

Serum levels of sclerostin, bone turnover markers and reproductive hormones were measured. In addition, we examined changes in sclerostin level from the reproductive stage to menopausal transition and from menopausal transition to early postmenopause in a longitudinal study.In the cross-sectional study, sclerostin level gradually increased with progression of menopausal stages and showed a significant change during the menopausal transition. Sclerostin levels significantly increased from the reproductive stage to menopausal transition and from menopausal transition to early postmenopause in the longitudinal study. A negative correlation of sclerostin with estradiol was found in early postmenopause. Sclerostin levels were negatively correlated with bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels in the reproductive stage and menopausal transition and with tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-5b in menopausal transition.The change in sclerostin has already occurred in the early stage of menopausal transition and sclerostin level increases with progression of menopausal stages. Elevated sclerostin levels during the menopausal transition may be involved in relative decline in bone formation against increase in bone resorption.",

However, many commercial devices fail to support suitable parameters (cut points) derived from the literature to help quantify physical activity (PA) due to differences in manufacturing. A simple metric to estimate cut points for new wearables is needed to aid data analysis.The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate a simple methodology to determine cut points based on ratios between sedentary behaviour (SB) and PA intensities for a new wrist worn device (PRO-Diary\u2122) by comparing its output to a validated and well characterised \u2018gold standard\u2019 (ActiGraph\u2122).Twelve participants completed a semi-structured (four-phase) treadmill protocol encompassing SB and three PA intensity levels (light, moderate, vigorous). The outputs of the devices were compared accounting for relative intensity.Count ratios (6.31, 7.68, 4.63, 3.96) were calculated to successfully determine cut-points for the new wrist worn wearable technology during SB (0\u2013426) as well as light (427\u2013803), moderate (804\u20132085) and vigorous (\u22652086) activities, respectively.Our findings should be utilised as a primary reference for investigations seeking to use new (wrist worn) wearable technology similar to that used here (i.e., PRO-Diary\u2122) for the purposes of quantifying SB and PA intensities. The utility of count ratios may be useful in comparing devices or SB/PA values estimated across different studies.

The increasing burden of dementia in our society, but also our increasing understanding of its risk factors and potential interventions, require diligent management of MCI in order to find strategies that produce effective prevention of dementia.To update knowledge regarding mild cognitive impairment, and to bring together and appraise evidence about the main features of clinical interest: definitions, prevalence and stability, risk factors, screening, and management and intervention.Literature review and consensus of expert opinion.MCI describes a level of impairment in which deteriorating cognitive functions still allow for reasonable independent living, including some compensatory strategies. While there is evidence for some early risk factors, there is still a need to more precisely delineate and distinguish early manifestations of frank dementia from cognitive impairment that is less likely to progress to dementia, and furthermore to develop improved prospective evidence for positive response to intervention. An important limitation derives from the scarcity of studies that take MCI as an endpoint. Strategies for effective management suffer from the same limitation, since most studies have focused on dementia. Behavioural changes may represent the most cost-effective approach.",

     "abstract": "Vitamin D is not only a key component in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis and bone health, but has also been implicated in a myriad of other non-skeletal biologic systems. The frailty syndrome is an emerging and increasingly important concept in the field of aging, with the \u201cphysical\u201d clinical phenotype being initially presented as the operational definition. The relationship between vitamin D and frailty is postulated to be largely mediated via the development of sarcopenia, a condition characterised by a combination of the reduction of muscle mass, plus either muscle strength or performance. Several molecular pathways may account for the development of muscle wasting in sarcopenia, and there is mounting epidemiological and laboratory evidence that supports a role of vitamin D on muscle cell proliferation and function. Although observational studies on vitamin D and frailty have not definitively established an independent relationship, interventional studies of the effect of supplemental vitamin D have yielded a positive influence on the frailty status, mainly via improvements in the physical performance. Further studies that are adequately powered and well-designed are warranted in an attempt to establish a causal relationship between vitamin D and frailty. In the absence of a consensus on the definition of the frailty syndrome, an appropriate and well-validated measure instrument for this health outcome would be recommended in the realm of frailty research.",

Dance may be a relevant form of exercise in PD and older adults due to social factors and accessibility. People with PD experience motor and non-motor symptoms, but treatments, interventions, and assessments often focus more on motor symptoms. Similar non-motor symptoms also occur in older adults. While it is well-known that dance may improve motor outcomes, it is less clear how dance affects non-motor symptoms. This review aims to describe the effects of dance interventions on non-motor symptoms in older adults and PD, highlights limitations of the literature, and identifies opportunities for future research. Overall, intervention parameters, study designs, and outcome measures differ widely, limiting comparisons across studies. Results are mixed in both populations, but evidence supports the potential for dance to improve mood, cognition, and quality of life in PD and healthy older adults. Participation and non-motor symptoms like sleep disturbances, pain, and fatigue have not been measured in older adults. Additional well-designed studies comparing dance and exercise interventions are needed to clarify the effects of dance on non-motor function and establish recommendations for these populations.",

Patients were classified as adequate responders (ARs, n\u00a0=\u00a066, mean age 68.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08 years) without incident fractures during 5 years of treatment, or inadequate responders (IRs, n\u00a0=\u00a054, mean age 67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09 years), with incident fractures between 1 and 5 years of treatment. Bone mineral density (DXA), structural analysis of the proximal femur and structural/fractal analysis of the distal radius were assessed. Sclerostin concentrations were measured by ELISA and 17\u03b2-estradiol levels by radioimmunoassay based on ultrasensitive methods.In the ARs group, sclerostin serum levels were significantly lower (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and estradiol concentrations significantly higher (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023) than in the IRs group. A logistic regression analysis was performed, including as independent variables in the original model femoral fracture load, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, previus history of fragility fracture, sclerostin and estradiol. Only previous history of fragility fracture (OR 14.04, 95% CI 2.38\u201382.79, p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and sclerostin levels (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.02\u20131.20, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), both adjusted by estradiol levels remained associated with IRs. Also, sclerostin concentrations were associated with the index of resistance to compression (IRC) in the fractal analysis of the distal radius, a parameter on bone microstructure.Sclerostin and estradiol levels are associated with the response to bisphosphonate therapy in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.",

However, results are inconsistent and the direction of the association between vitamin D and lipid levels remains unknown. We examined bidirectional associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and cholesterol concentrations.We used data from 1165 participants aged 55 to 88 years from the Rotterdam Study, a population-based prospective cohort study.Serum concentrations of 25(OH)D, total cholesterol (TC) and HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured at two time points with a median time difference of 6 years. Bidirectional associations between 25(OH)D and each of the blood lipids was examined with path analyses in cross-lagged models. All models were adjusted for baseline age, sex, BMI, smoking status, and diet quality.The best-fit model for 25(OH)D and TC indicated that higher baseline TC concentrations were associated with lower 25(OH)D concentrations (standardized regression coefficient -0.05 (SE 0.02)), but 25(OH)D at baseline did not predict TC. For HDL-C, the best-fit model suggested a bidirectional inverse association between HDL-C and 25(OH)D (standardized regression coefficients of -0.03 (SE 0.02)) for both directions.Our results from path analyses on repeatedly measured 25(OH)D and lipid levels suggest that total cholesterol may be associated with decreased in 25(OH)D concentrations, but not the other way around, whereas the observed inverse association between HDL-C and 25(OH)D may be bidirectional.",

Menopause is reached upon exhaustion of the resting primordial follicle pool, occurring on average at 51 years of age (range 40\u201360 years). The mean global age at natural menopause (ANM) appears robust, suggesting a distinct genetic control. Accordingly, a strong correlation in ANM is observed between mothers and daughters. Few specific genetic determinants of ANM have been identified.Substantial efforts have been made to predict ANM by using anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) levels. AMH serum concentrations at reproductive age predict ANM, but precision is currently limited. Early ANM is associated with early preceding fertility loss, whereas late menopause is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality later in life. Menopause affects various women's health aspects, including bone density, breast, the cardiovascular system, mood/cognitive function and sexual well-being.If the current trend of increasing human life expectancy persists, women will soon spend half their life postmenopause. Unfortunately, increased longevity does not coincide with an equal increase in years spend in good health.

However, the main risk of COC, venous thromboembolism, seems not to be relevant in (non-hospitalized) Chinese women and perhaps also other Asian women. COC may therefore be in fact a better choice than POP for these groups. In contrast to POP and IUDs, they have a variety of benefits especially important for middle-aged women, including a large decrease of the risk of ovarian, endometrial and colorectal cancer, an improvement in bleeding irregularities, a reduction of climacteric symptoms and some protection against bone loss.

Many factors, both genetic and non-genetic, determine a woman\u2019s risk of breast cancer and several mathematical models have been proposed that determine the risk. It is important to identify those at high risk, as there are now effective preventive strategies, such as chemoprevention therapy and risk-reduction surgery. Risk-reduction agents are recommended for women aged 35 years or more who are at high risk of breast cancer. Tamoxifen is presently deemed to be the agent of choice. However, raloxifene may be preferable, at least for some postmenopausal women, because of its lack of effect on the endometrium and the reduced incidence of venous thromboembolic events compared with tamoxifen. Prophylactic surgery has been widely investigated. Bilateral mastectomy decreases the risk of developing breast cancer by approximately 90% in women at moderate or high risk and in known BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

The decline in the endogenous production of estrogen (especially the main circulating physiological hormone, 17\u03b2-estradiol, E2) at menopause (51 years on average) often leads to functional disorders affecting the quality of life. Estrogen deficiency impacts different tissues and results in an increase of various diseases, such as osteoporosis or cardiovascular diseases. Hormone therapy (HT) for menopause is a rather new challenge which experienced vagaries following the women\u2019s health initiative (WHI) study conducted in largely post-menopausal women. In the first part of this review, we will try to summarize the main conclusions of the WHI trials, in particular the timing effect as well as the deleterious impact of the associated progestin, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).Hormone therapy, particularly the conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) combined with the MPA favor the occurrence of breast cancer, whereas conversely selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene) that block the activity of estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) prevent the risk of recurrence of ERa-positive breast cancers. A new strategy of ERa modulation called tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC), combines (1) CEE to maintain the benefits of estrogen (climacteric symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis) and (2) bazedoxifene, which is not only a SERM, but which also induces a rapid degradation of ERa in the uterus and in the breast, thereby prevents the stimulatory effects of estrogens on epithelial proliferation of these two sex targets. In the second part of this review, we will summarize the recognized benefits of the TSEC approach, and our current knowledge of its potential benefits and risks.",

Isolation of cells, termed oogonial stem cells (OSCs), from adult rodent and human ovaries has been reported, with these cells exhibiting both germ and stem cell markers in culture. When re-introduced into an ovarian somatic environment these cells have generated follicles capable of producing healthy offspring in rodents, and there is some evidence of human OSCs being able to form oocyte-like structures in a xenotransplant model. Importantly, there are no data on their potential physiological role within the ovary, and specifically no evidence that they contribute to the primordial follicle pool and thus to later stages of follicle development. The cues required for oocyte differentiation from these cells are not well understood either in vivo or in vitro, and these will need to be further elucidated to maximise their potential for therapeutic intervention. OSCs may also be of value as a model to investigate normal human germ cell differentiation. It is likely that their interactions with ovarian somatic cells and/or extracellular signals will be important in these processes.

Recent studies validate those complaints by showing significant correlations between memory complaints and performance on validated memory tasks. Longitudinal studies demonstrate modest declines in verbal memory during the menopausal transition and a likely rebound during the postmenopausal stage. Clinical studies that examine changes in memory following hormonal withdrawal and add-back hormone therapy (HT) demonstrate that estradiol plays a critical role in memory. Although memory changes are frequently attributed to menopausal symptoms, studies show that the memory problems occur during the transition even after controlling for menopausal symptoms. It is well established that self-reported vasomotor symptoms (VMS) are unrelated to objective memory performance. However, emerging evidence suggests that objectively measured VMS significantly correlate with memory performance, brain activity during rest, and white matter hyperintensities. This evidence raises important questions about whether VMS and VMS treatments might affect memory during the menopausal transition. Unfortunately, there are no clinical trials to inform our understanding of how HT affects both memory and objectively measured VMS in women in whom HT is indicated for treatment of moderate to severe VMS. In clinical practice, it is helpful to normalize memory complaints, to note that evidence suggests that memory problems are temporary, and to counsel women with significant VMS that memory might improve with treatment.",

While a cautious approach to hormone-dependent cancer is warranted, for women treated for non-hormone-related tumours alternative treatments for menopausal symptoms should be given due consideration, as any reluctance to prescribe HRT for them has neither a biological nor a clinical basis. In studies of HRT for survivors of endometrial and ovarian cancer, for instance, no evidence of increased risk was found, although no definitive conclusions can yet be formulated. The positive effect of HRT on quality of life seems to outweigh the unfounded suspicion of an increased risk of recurrence of non-hormone-related tumours.

     "abstract": "Despite a decrease in the use of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) over the last decade, many women are still prescribed this treatment, as it remains the most effective means of counteracting climacteric symptoms. Its use declined when it was shown that HT increases the risk of breast cancer, stroke and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Nevertheless, that benefit/risk ratio was established among women using oral estrogens alone or combined with a specific progestogen and it cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other HTs.Oral estrogens increase the risk of VTE especially during the first year of treatment and past users revert to a similar risk as women who have never used them.There is now growing evidence that VTE risk among HT users strongly depends on the route of administration. Indeed, transdermal estrogens, unlike oral estrogens, are not associated with an increased VTE risk and biological data support this difference between oral and transdermal estrogens. In addition, transdermal estrogens may not confer additional risk in women at high risk of VTE. Significant differences in thrombotic risk between HT preparations also relate to the concomitant progestogen. Studies have consistently shown that VTE risk is higher among users of combined estrogens plus progestogens than among users of estrogens alone. With respect to the different pharmacological classes of progestogens, two observational studies found that norpregnane derivatives are associated with an increased VTE risk, whereas micronized progesterone may be safe with respect to thrombotic risk. In conclusion, transdermal estrogens alone or combined with micronized progesterone may represent the safest alternative for women who require HT.",

     "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are disturbances that seriously endanger the physical health and often the lives of sufferers and affect their psychosocial functioning. EDs are usually thought of as problems afflicting teenagers. However, the incidence in older women has increased in recent decades. These cases may represent either late-onset disease or, more likely, a continuation of a lifelong disorder.The DSM-5 classification differentiates 4 categories of eating disorder: anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorders and other specified feeding and eating disorders.The weight loss and malnutrition resulting from EDs have widespread negative consequences for physical, mental and social health. The main risk factors for developing long-term consequences are the degree of weight loss and the chronicity of the illness. Most of the cardiac, neurological, pulmonary, gastric, haematological and dermatological complications of EDs are reversible with weight restoration. EDs are serious illnesses and they should never be neglected or treated only as a manifestation of the fashion for dieting or a woman's wish to achieve an imposed standard feminine figure.Additionally, EDs are associated with high risk of morbidity and mortality.The literature concerning EDs in older, postmenopausal women is very limited. The main aim of this paper is to ascertain the epidemiology and prognosis of EDs in older women, and to review their diagnosis and management.",

     "abstract": "Women who develop preeclampsia have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) later in life. However, current guidelines on cardiovascular risk assessment and prevention are unclear on how and when to screen these women postpartum, and about the role of a positive history of preeclampsia in later-life CVD risk management. The aim of this review is to discuss the present knowledge on commonly used cardiovascular screening modalities available to women with a history of preeclampsia, and to discuss recent developments in early detection of CVD using cardiovascular imaging.Furthermore, we explore how female-specific risk factors may have additional value in cardiovascular screening, in particular in relatively young women, although their implementation in clinical practice is challenged by inconsistent results and lack of long-term outcome data. Non-invasive imaging techniques, e.g., coronary artery intima-media thickness (CIMT), can be helpful to detect subclinical atherosclerotic disease, and coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) has shown to be effective in early detection of cardiovascular damage. However, while more short-term and long-term follow-up studies are becoming available, few studies have investigated women with a history of preeclampsia in the fourth and fifth decade of life, when early signs of premature CVD are most likely to become apparent. Further studies are needed to inform new and improved clinical practice guidelines, and provide long-term strategies to effectively prevent CVD, specifically targeted at women with a history of preeclampsia. Additionally, evaluation of feasibility, cost-effectiveness, and implementation of CVD screening and prevention initiatives targeted at former preeclampsia patients are needed.",

Being a carer can be challenging and carers may need support but they frequently fail to access it. Compared to research investigating the experiences of female carers, research with male carers is underdeveloped. The available evidence suggests male and female carers have many experiences in common but some research suggests that compared to females, male carers are even less likely to access services.The aim of this systematic review was therefore to synthesise research investigating adult male carers\u2019 experiences of accessing formal and informal support focussing on the barriers and facilitators.Nine health and social care electronic databases were searched (e.g. PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL Plus, Social Policy and Practice, Scopus). Seven studies (five qualitative and two quantitative) fitting the inclusion criteria were identified. All came from North America and most focussed on older carers caring for people with dementia. All seven studies described barriers to accessing support and three highlighted facilitators. Male carers felt committed to their role, seeing it as their responsibility but were often ambivalent about seeking help. Insufficient service information was frequently emphasised. Participants highlighted positive past experiences and professional or voluntary sector support in providing information and helping access services.Research into male carers\u2019 experiences in accessing support remains underdeveloped. Research that distinguishes between, for example, the experiences of spouses and sons and with direct comparisons between male and female carers is needed.

The resultant estrogenic or antiestrogenic effect is dependent on the concentration of these phytoestrogens relative to endogenous estrogens and the site of their action, among others. Thus, isoflavones and lignans act as selective estrogen receptor modulators; having a beneficial effect in some tissues while simultaneously causing deleterious changes in others.This case-control study investigates the relationship between urinary concentrations of genistein, daidzein, equol, and enterolactone, and the presence of uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) in Jamaican women.Phytoestrogen concentration in spot urine samples from 157 uterine fibroid cases and 171 fibroid-free controls diagnosed by ultrasonography, were assessed by Time-resolved Fluoroimmnoassay. Statistical evaluations were performed using SPSS 12.0.The median concentration of urinary enterolactone was significantly different between uterine fibroid cases and controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029). However, this was not observed to affect risk of uterine fibroid, as trends across quartiles of urine enterolactone did not differ significantly between cases and controls.

Mutations were stratified for gene (BRCA1 or BRCA2) and location (within or outside the OCCR). FH was stratified for type of cancer occurring in first and second-degree relatives (OC only, breast cancer (BC) only or both OC and BC).Cox-proportional hazard models were applied to estimate the OCCR effect, including and excluding a FH of cancer.Among BRCA1 families, OC risks were higher in women with OCCR mutations versus those with non-OCCR mutations (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.59, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.19\u20132.12).

Evaluation included a DEXA scan and a detailed demographic survey for bone health. Comparison was made between women with a history of AP and those without.In total, 87 women who had a history of AP were compared with 153 women who did not have a history of AP.

Multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that women who have 0\u201312 months interpregnancy interval have the highest risk for osteoporosis (OR: 4.306; 95% CI, 1.684\u201311.01). This analysis confirmed that the occurrence of first pregnancy under 27 years of age conveyed a higher risk for osteoporosis, as well.Shortened IPI may have a detrimental effect on bone mineral density in postmenopausal age.",

Olfactory and gustatory functions were measured using a short version of Sniffin\u2019 Sticks and Taste Strips tests (Burghart). Information about socio-demographic characteristics, health, perceived smell and taste impairment, diminished eating pleasure and appetite were obtained with a specially designed questionnaire.Prevalence of chemosensory impairment detected in this sample is high, being 41% for taste and 33% for olfaction. However, the frequency of self-reported impairment is consistently lower than the measured one, especially in men and in older subjects.Measured chemosensory impairment is not significantly related with eating pleasure and appetite. On the other hand, factors significantly influencing decline of eating pleasure are: living alone, dietary restriction and perceived taste impairment. Meanwhile, a significant influence of dietary restriction, dentures and subjective health status on appetite decline is observed.The results of this study show that chemosensory impairment may not be related with diminished eating pleasure and appetite, while other non-physiological factors such as loneliness, dietary restrictions and subjective health should be taken more into account in order to develop effective strategies to counteract malnutrition in the elderly. In addition, low awareness of chemosensory impairment among this sample highlights the importance of measuring sensory acuity rather than asking by questionnaire or interview, in order to obtain reliable data.",

This review aims to identify short, valid instruments that detect older community-dwellers risk of four adverse outcomes: hospitalisation, functional-decline, institutionalisation and death. Data sources included PubMed and the Cochrane library. Data on outcome measures, patient and instrument characteristics, and trial quality (using the Quality In Prognosis Studies [QUIPS] tool), were double-extracted for derivation-validation studies in community-dwelling older adults (>50 years). Forty-six publications, representing 23 unique instruments, were included. Only five were externally validated. Mean patient age range was 64.2\u201384.6 years. Most instruments n\u00a0=\u00a018, (78%) were derived in North America from secondary analysis of survey data.

Abstract and full text selection was done by two independent reviewers. A total of 25 relevant publications including 37 biochemical markers of bone and cartilage turnover and inflammation associated with some aspects of OA were reviewed. Most of those biomarkers were studied only once or twice. Due to heterogeneity of both OA-phenotype and determinant among the publications, meta-analysis of the studied biochemical markers was not possible. There was strong evidence for urinary C-terminal telopeptide of collagen type II (uCTX-II) as a prognostic marker for knee OA progression and serum cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP) level as prognostic marker for incidence of knee and hip OA. Evidence for prognostic value of C-reactive protein is still inconclusive. International standardization of future investigations should be pursued to obtain more high-quality, homogenous data on the full spectrum of biochemical OA markers.",

Population aging is associated to an increased frequency of age-related diseases including higher susceptibility to infections, cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Immunosenescence refers to the decline of the immune system associated to aging. It affects both, innate and adaptive immunity limiting the response to pathogens and to vaccines. The analyses of the immune system in elderly individuals determined several immune signatures constituting an immune risk phenotype that predicts mortality. An inverse CD4/CD8 ratio, loss of na\u00efve T cells, increased numbers of terminally-differentiated T cells and oligoclonal expansions of virus-specific T cells constitute hallmarks of immunosenescence. Natural killer (NK) cells are also found severely altered in the elderly. The contribution of latent cytomegalovirus infection to immunosenescence of T and NK cells has been shown. Considering the worldwide ageing of the population in the next decades, the impact of infections will be a real health problem for older individuals requiring preventive strategies. Thus, further studies are required to analyse the bases of immunosenescence and to establish protocols to overcome the age-associated alterations of the immune response in order to define effective vaccines against those pathogens, such as influenza, contributing to increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly.",

The advent of personalized medicine, or the use of a patient's genetic profile to guide medical decisions, is touted to substantially improve drug tolerance and efficacy and, in so doing, also improve the effectiveness and efficiency of oncological care. Amidst the hype and hope surrounding personalized cancer care, there is increasing concern about its unnecessary, unintended effects especially with regards to the financial burden of targeted therapies using specialty drugs. In this paper, we take a patient-centered perspective on the therapeutic benefits of personalized medicine as well as the limitations of current practice and its psychological and financial toxicities by focusing on advanced-stage lung cancer. We argue that the modest clinical benefits of targeted therapy, premium prices for many specialty drugs and the narrow focus on the genetic constitution of individual patients run the risk of undercutting personalized lung cancer care's contribution to realizing health and non-health outcomes. We discuss the contribution of grading the financial burden of treatment and seamless integration of palliative care as key action areas regarding patients\u2019 access to and appropriateness of care given patients\u2019 needs and preferences.",

Carers of people with physical conditions had the highest levels of depression and burden. Patient diagnosis, hours spent caring, and burden were associated with depression, while hours spent caring and carer depression were associated with burden. These factors contributed approximately 25\u201330% of the variance of depression and burden, respectively.The diagnosis of the patient was a factor associated with depression, and older carers of people with physical conditions were at the highest risk.

     "abstract": "Incident ultraviolet radiation from sunlight varies in intensity and spectrum with season and latitude and has both deleterious and beneficial effects on health in older people. Sunlight is the major preventable risk factor for skin cancer. Non-melanoma skin cancer is the commonest malignancy in a pale skinned older population, but the mortality is extremely low. Intermittent sun exposure is a risk factor for the more dangerous melanoma but chronic sun exposure and outdoor occupation may be protective. Public health advice has tended to concentrate on the dangers of sun exposure despite the absence of any data that increased sun exposure correlates with raised all-cause mortality.Inadequate sun exposure carries its own risks, and the older population are particularly sun deprived as recorded by low serum Vitamin D levels and lack of outdoor activity. Sunlight has health benefits dependently and independently of vitamin D synthesis. Low serum vitamin D levels correlate with increased morbidity and mortality but the direction of association is not always clear. Vitamin D has a causal role in calcium and phosphate metabolism, in skeletal health and probably reduction of colorectal cancer. Evidence is weak for a role in cardiovascular health, but mobilisation of nitric oxide by UVA radiation from nitrate stores in skin, with consequent reduction in BP, may account for the observed reduction in cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality with increased sun exposure. Advice on healthy sun exposure needs to be reconsidered, with reduction in all-cause mortality and morbidity as the primary end point.",

However, \u2018old age\u2019 is a nebulous concept with definitions ranging from the over 50s to the over 85s. In seeking to explore ageism and age discrimination within health care, this paper discusses the concept of \u2018old\u2019 and discusses the findings of a narrative review of the literature on these two concepts. Results show that negative attitudes have been perceived by users of health care services, but the reasons are not clear. Such attitudes are usually reported in acute health care settings, where targets and quick turnover are encouraged. Thus people, usually those with complex needs, who require longer periods of recuperation and rehabilitation following an episode of ill health, are troublesome to staff working in a system geared up for early discharges. This type of service user is usually over the age of 85. Recommendations from this paper include the need for acute frailty units, with well trained staff, where frail older people can be comprehensively assessed, receive timely and targeted care, followed by a supported discharge.",

A better understanding of post-menopausal women's profiles as defined by their attitude and behaviours in relation to their VVA symptoms may improve public health policies and will allow appropriate targeting of public health campaigns. These improvements may help women of middle and advanced age recover and maintain their quality of life.In this study, we analysed the attitudes of post-menopausal women, aged 45\u201374 years, with VVA symptoms from five European countries, with the aim of identifying profile markers to improve healthcare strategies.Two consecutive cross-sectional studies were conducted in five European countries (the UK, France, Spain, Germany and Italy).

Many interventions have been investigated and summarised in meta-analyses (MA) and there is a need to synthesise the top of the hierarchy of evidence in one place. Therefore we conducted an umbrella review of MA of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of falls prevention interventions LTCF and hospitals. Two independent reviewers searched major electronic databases from inception till October 2014 for MA containing \u22653 RCTs investigating any intervention to prevent falls in LTCF or hospitals in older adults aged \u226560 years. Methodological quality was assessed by the AMSTAR tool and data were narratively synthesised. The methodological quality of the MA was moderate to high across the 10 included MA. Nine MA provided data for LTCF and only two considered hospital settings. Only one MA defined a fall and two reported adverse events (although minor). Consistent evidence suggests that multifactorial interventions reduce falls (including the rate, risk and odds of falling) in LTCF and hospitals. Inconsistent evidence exists for exercise and vitamin D as single interventions in LTCF, whilst no MA has investigated this in hospitals. No evidence exists for hip protectors and medication review on falls in LTCF. In conclusion, multifactorial interventions appear to be the most effective interventions to prevent falls in LTCF and hospital settings. This is not without limitations and more high quality RCTs are needed in hospital settings in particular. Future RCTs and MA should clearly report adverse events.",

Whilst they are a common cause of lower urinary tract symptoms in all women they may be associated with increased morbidity in the elderly. Appropriate investigation and treatment in primary and secondary care are essential to effectively manage urinary tract infection and decrease morbidity and hospitalisation rates. Loss of endogenous oestrogen at the time of the menopause is associated with the urogenital atrophy and an increased incidence of urinary tract infection. Consequently vaginal oestrogen therapy may offer a rationale for treatment and prevent of urinary tract infection.The aim of this paper is to review the clinical management of elderly women presenting with primary and recurrent urinary tract infection.",

     "abstract": "The past 25 years have revealed that distinct patterns of ischemic heart disease exist in women that are importantly different from the male standard. Premenopausal women have a lower risk factor profile resulting in fewer cardiovascular events at younger age, which reverses at older age. First signs of vascular ageing appear in middle-aged women, with a predominance of functional coronary abnormalities over anatomical obstructions. Over 50% of symptomatic middle-aged women have coronary microvascular dysfunction that is often poorly recognized and treated. This microvascular syndrome has different symptomatic characteristics compared to the classic pattern of angina pectoris related with obstructive coronary disease. Vascular dysfunction is also an important contributor to the occurrence of acute coronary syndromes in relatively young women. Female-specific signs and symptoms related to various stages of life are increasingly helpful tools in identifying women at increased risk. This evolving knowledge in \u2018gynecardiology\u2019 is an important challenge for more interaction between gynecologists and cardiologists to further improve accurate prevention in those women at highest need.",

Insomnia can occur as a secondary disorder to hot flashes, mood disorders, medical conditions, psychosocial factors, underlying intrinsic sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) or restless legs syndrome (RLS), or it can be a primary disorder. Since unrecognized OSA can have dramatic health-related consequences, menopausal women complaining of persisting sleep disturbances suggesting primary insomnia or intrinsic sleep disorders should be referred to a sleep specialist for a comprehensive sleep assessment.Patients suffering from primary insomnia will be preferentially treated with non-benzodiazepine hypnotics or melatonin, or with cognitive behavioural therapy.Insomnia related to vasomotor symptoms can be improved with hormone replacement therapy. Gabapentin and isoflavones have also shown efficacy in small series but their precise role has yet to be established.In patients suffering from OSA, non-pharmacological therapy will be applied: continuous positive airway pressure or an oral appliance, according to the severity of the disorder.In the case of RLS, triggering factors must be avoided; dopaminergic agonists are the first-line treatment for moderate to severe disease.In conclusion, persisting sleep complaints should be addressed in menopausal women, in order to correctly diagnose the specific causal disorder and to prescribe treatments that have been shown to improve sleep quality, quality of life and long-term health status.",

For this reason, the aim of this consensus document is to devise a protocol for geriatric nutritional assessment. A multidisciplinary team has been set up within the Spanish Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology (in Spanish Sociedad Espa\u00f1ola de Geriatr\u00eda y Gerontolog\u00eda, SEGG) in order to address undernutrition and risk of undernutrition so that they can be diagnosed and treated in an effective manner.The MNA-SF is a practical tool amongst the many validated methods for nutritional screening. Following suspicion of undernutrition or after establishing the presence of undernutrition, a full assessment will include a detailed nutritional history of the patient. The compilation of clinical-nutritional and dietetic histories seeks to aid in identifying the possible risk factors at the root of a patient's undernutrition. Following this, an anthropometric assessment associated to laboratory data, will describe the patient's physical and metabolic changes associated to undernutrition. Currently, the tendency is to further nutritional assessment through the use of non-invasive techniques to study body composition in association with functional status. The latter is an indirect index for nutritional status which is very interesting from a geriatrician's point of view. To conclude, correct nutritional screening is the fundamental basis for an early undernutrition diagnosis and to assess the need for nutritional treatment. In order to achieve this, it is fundamental to foster research in the field of nutritional geriatrics, in order to expand our knowledge base and to increasingly practice evidence-based geriatrics.",

Sexual dysfunction is prevalent in the general population, but in women with UI, the prevalence is greater (42\u201356%). This review assesses the effects of urinary continence surgery on the sexual function of women with UI.Stress UI is surgically mostly managed via Burch colposuspension or a mid-urethral sling. These operations are as effective as each other with regards to maintaining or improving in sexual function. One of the main risks of these operations are that urgency UI (UUI) may be exacerbated or arise de novo and this has been shown to decrease sexual function.Severe refractory UUI requires complex surgery, such as percutaneous sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) then augmentation cystoplasty or urinary diversion. SNS may improve sexual function by direct action on the pudendal nerve as well as improving incontinence. Urinary diversion and augmentation cystoplasty are procedures of last resort in women who are refractory to all other UUI treatments. The majority of women report no change or improvement in sexual function as the urinary diversion negates the requirement for incontinence pads and indwelling catheters. Deteriorated sexual function has also been described in up to 37.5%. Thirty percent of women undergoing urinary diversion would have liked more \u2018sexological\u2019 counselling.The majority of women enjoy maintained or improved sexual function after surgical treatment of UI. It is important to ensure women have appropriate pre-operative assessment and counselling so they may be advised of the risks of failed surgery including deteriorated sexual function.",

     "abstract": "Eating disorders are serious psychiatric illnesses which can occur across the lifespan. Men aged midlife and beyond are vulnerable to stigma, shame, and stereotypes portraying eating disorders as afflictions of youth and female gender. Historically, men have been neglected in the field of eating disorders owing to traditional and female-centric approaches to conceptualization and classification. In this literature review, we identified 16 case reports of eating disorders in males ranging from the age of 40 to 81 years. The majority of cases reported an earlier onset in life, followed by a variable course of illness with periods of relapse interspersed with remission. Diagnostic crossover or symptom fluctuation was common. High rates of comorbid depression were found, and several cases described a history of weight cycling and premorbid obesity. Precipitating factors included stressors which disproportionately occur in later life, including loss due to death or divorce, changes in financial or housing situation, and medical issues. Very little is known regarding the prevalence of eating disorders in older men, with initial population estimates ranging from 0.02% to 1.6%. Rates of subthreshold eating disordered behavior are higher and appear to be increasing among older individuals and males in the community. Recent revisions in the DSM-5 will likely increase the broader applicability of diagnostic criteria for eating disorders, stimulating improved recognition of diverse presentations occurring across the lifespan for both genders. Eating disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis of unexplained weight gain or weight loss irrespective of age or gender. Multi-site studies are needed for adequate sampling and to allow larger empirical investigations regarding how to improve clinical practices in screening and assessment, as well the provision of differential care for older men suffering from an eating disorder.",

Our comprehensive meta-analysis indicated that the FokI and BsmI VDR gene polymorphisms may be significantly associated with gynecological cancers. We suggest monitoring VDR gene polymorphisms as potential biomarkers in patients with gynecological malignancy.",

     "abstract": "The association of thyroid dysfunction with alterations in mood and cognition has been recognised since some of the earliest descriptions of thyroid disease. Over the years, researchers have aimed to further define these effects throughout the spectrum of thyroid disorders, to better understand the underlying condition and refine indications for treatment. More recently, attention has turned towards examining the impact of differences in thyroid hormones within the normal reference range, particularly in older adults, providing new insights into the association of thyroid hormone with cognitive decline. This review summarises the evidence assessing the influence of thyroid hormone on mood and cognition in overt and subclinical hypothyroidism, within the reference range, and in subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism. Treatment of overt thyroid dysfunction largely resolves associated disturbances in mood and cognitive dysfunction, however in the setting of overt hypothyroidism subtle detrimental effects on cognition may not be fully reversed. Subclinical hyperthyroidism and higher free thyroxine (FT4) within the normal range have been associated with poorer cognitive outcomes. Future research including randomised controlled trials are required to confirm causality and guide the assessment of benefits vs risks of intervention in the increasing population of older adults with subclinical thyroid disease.",

The screenings of titles and abstracts, full text review, and risk of bias assessments were done by two independent reviewers.A total of 12,548 articles were identified. After title and abstract screening and removal of duplicates, 692 articles were retrieved for full text review. Five studies were deemed eligible for inclusion in the analysis, and the methodological quality was assessed. Two of the studies were randomized controlled trials and three were observational studies. One randomized controlled trial found that menopausal women who received hormone therapy were at a higher risk for developing minor to moderate flares of systemic lupus erythematosus. In the other four studies, there was no significant difference in systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity between hormone therapy and non-hormone therapy users.Hormone therapy in menopausal patients with systemic lupus erythematosus appears to be well tolerated. While there is some evidence supporting an increase in risk of mild to moderate flares among hormone therapy users, no association was identified between hormone therapy use and severe disease flares. In addition, hormone therapy was associated with significant improvement in menopausal symptoms and quality of life. Larger trials are required to assess the long-term effects of hormone therapy on the course of systemic lupus erythematosus in menopausal patients and to identify patient characteristics associated with an increased risk of flares in the setting of hormone therapy exposure.",

Long-term prospective randomized clinical trials across the globe have demonstrated a reduction in progression of prediabetes when lifestyle modifications are adopted and these effects can last up to 20 years beyond the period of intervention.

     "abstract": "Delirium is a common occurrence in older hospitalised patients, particularly in the setting of surgical intervention and acute illness. Delirium is associated with a number of adverse clinical and social outcomes with higher financial cost and risk of developing dementia, as well as increased likelihood of need for residential care. Current interventions for the prevention of delirium typically involve recognition and amelioration of modifiable risk factors and treatment of underlying conditions that predispose the individual to delirium. A number of pharmacological strategies for delirium prevention have been tested. Antipsychotic medications are used for treatment of agitation in the setting of delirium when other measures have failed, but their efficacy in prevention is limited by study heterogeneity and concerns about tolerability. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are effective in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease but do not appear to be effective in preventing delirium. Melatonin and melatonin agonists have a rather benign side effect profile and show promise for prevention of delirium in medically unwell individuals. The alpha-2 agonist, dexmedetomidine may be helpful in the intensive care unit setting but intravenous route of administration and need for close clinical supervision limits its use in the wider hospital environment. Other agents such as benzodiazepines, corticosteroids, statins and gabapentin have been suggested but lack evidence to support their role in delirium prevention. To date, there is inconsistent and conflicting data regarding the efficacy of any particular pharmacological agent although some interventions do show promise. Larger, well-designed, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed.",

This study tests two models with both positive and negative well-being indices as outcomes: the first included menopausal factors as predictors; the second model expanded the first by adding self-compassion, a protective trait, as a predictor and moderator.Cross-sectional study based on self-report questionnaires from 206 women aged 40\u201360, currently experiencing hot flushes.Hot flush interference ratings, emotional balance, satisfaction with life, eudaimonic well-being and depressive symptoms.In model one, menopausal stage and hot flush frequency were independent of well-being outcomes. Beliefs about perceived control over menopause was the strongest predictor of well-being (\u03b2 range: .22\u2013.32), followed by hot flush interference ratings (\u03b2 range: .15\u2013.33). In model two, self-compassion was the strongest predictor of well-being indices (\u03b2 range: .20\u2013.39), followed by beliefs about control (\u03b2 range: .16\u2013.20) and interference ratings (\u03b2 range: .17\u2013.26).Psychological aspects of the menopause appear more strongly linked to well-being than physiological aspects such as menopausal stage and hot flush frequency. Specifically, self-compassion, feeling in control of menopause and low interference ratings are three factors that are associated with well-being among midlife women. These aspects could be considered in tandem, as a means to support well-being in the context of menopause.",

The purpose of this review is to: (1) detail results of dance intervention studies in older adults and in PD, (2) describe limitations of dance research in these populations, and (3) identify directions for future study. Generally, a wide variety of dance styles have been investigated in older adults, while a more limited subset has been evaluated in PD. Measures vary widely across studies and a lack of standardized outcomes measures hinders cross-studies comparisons. Compared to the dance literature in older adults, there is a notable absence of evidence in the PD literature in outcome domains related to cardiovascular health, muscle strength, body composition, flexibility, and proprioception.

One of the main roles assigned to albumin is as an indicator of malnutrition. There are many factors, in addition to nutrition, that influence levels of albumin in plasma. The main aim of this review is to assess the clinical significance of albumin in elderly people in the community, in hospital and in care homes. Following the review, it can be stated that age is not a cause of hypoalbuminemia. Albumin is a good marker of nutritional status in clinically stable people. Significant loss of muscle mass has been observed in elderly people with low albumin levels. Hypoalbuminemia is a mortality prognostic factor in elderly people, whether they live in the community or they are in hospital or institutionalized. Low levels of albumin are associated to worse recovery following acute pathologies. Inflammatory state and, particularly, high concentrations of IL-6 and TNF-alpha, are two of the main influencing factors of hypoalbuminemia. In elderly patients with a hip fracture, albumin levels below 38\u00a0g/L are associated to a higher risk of post-surgery complications, especially infections. Further research is needed on the impact of nutritional intervention upon albumin levels and on the outcomes in elderly people in the community, in hospital and in care.",

The second three groups were premenopausal and postmenopausal women, with a history of breast cancer and currently taking tamoxifen treatment, or postmenopausal women currently taking an aromatase inhibitor, needing contra-lateral corrective esthetic surgery.In the group of women without history of breast cancer, normal cycling women (n\u00a0=\u00a024) presented a strong correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.853; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) between 17\u03b2-estradiol concentration in serum (median: 29.7\u00a0pg/mL; IQR: 10.8\u201382.3\u00a0pg/mL) and in breast tissue (30.6\u00a0pg/g; IQR: 18.6\u2013183.8\u00a0pg/g). Postmenopausal women had low 17\u03b2-estradiol concentrations both in serum and breast tissue (r\u00a0=\u00a00.813; P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, n\u00a0=\u00a016). Women taking oral contraceptives (n\u00a0=\u00a012) had low serum and breast tissue levels of estradiol (r\u00a0=\u00a00.376; P\u00a0=\u00a0n.s.).Premenopausal women (n\u00a0=\u00a06, mean age: 44.2 years) with a history of breast cancer and currently taking tamoxifen, had very high concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol both in serum (277.9\u00a0pg/mL; IQR: 96.2\u2013544.7\u00a0pg/mL) and in epithelial cells (251.9\u00a0pg/g; IQR: 115.0\u2013426.5\u00a0pg/g) (r\u00a0=\u00a00.803; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen (n\u00a0=\u00a04, mean age: 48.3) had low concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol in serum (7.0\u00a0pg/mL; IQR: 5.7\u201316.3\u00a0pg/mL) and in epithelial cells (14.6\u00a0pg/g IQR: 13.3\u201316.3\u00a0pg/g) (r\u00a0=\u00a00.10; P\u00a0=\u00a0n.s.). The estradiol concentration in the breast of premenopausal women taking tamoxifen was 8.2 times higher that observed in the breast of normal cycling women, and 17.3 times higher that observed in postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen. Women taking adjuvant aromatase inhibitors had extremely low concentrations of 17\u03b2-estradiol both in serum and in breast tissue.This study shows that serum estradiol levels largely determine estrogen levels in normal breast tissue.",

The severity of the VVA symptoms examined in detail in the different groups.A parallel improvement of pain at sexual activity was observed in women who had moderate to severe (MS) dyspareunia as their most bothersome symptom (MBS) (n\u00a0=\u00a0183) or not MBS (n\u00a0=\u00a0240) and MS without being MBS (n\u00a0=\u00a057) with a 1.70 severity unit change in the MBS group for a decrease of 66.1% from baseline (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 versus baseline) over 52 weeks. A further improvement of dyspareunia, namely 0.33 severity unit (19.4%), was observed with continuing treatment from 12 weeks to 52 weeks. Similar results were observed on vaginal dryness and irritation/itching. Highly significant beneficial effects (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 versus baseline for all) were observed at gynecological examination on vaginal secretions, color, epithelial integrity and epithelial surface thickness.The present study shows, in addition to the parallel benefits on the three symptoms of VVA, that the choice of any of the MS symptoms as being or not being MBS by women has no influence on the observed therapeutic effect (NCT01256671).",

Measurements of serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), HDL-C, HDL2-C, HDL3-C and non-HDL-C concentrations and the TC/HDL-C concentration ratio were considered.Men had lower TC than postmenopausal women (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and similar LDL-C.

With standardization for confounding variables, including standardization to age of menopause (50 years), differences apparent in the non-standardized comparisons were generally sustained, although HDL3-C levels were lower at menopause, HDL2-C ceased to differ and LDL-C was lower in postmenopausal women than men.Male gender is associated with a more atherogenic profile than female gender, with appreciably lower levels of the HDL2-C subfraction.

This study tested the effectiveness of an intervention delivered in different modes in decreasing menopausal symptoms in midlife women.The Women's Wellness Program (WWP) intervention was delivered to 225 Australian women aged between 40 and 65 years through three modes (i.e., on-line independent, face-to-face with nurse consultations, and on-line with virtual nurse consultations). All women in the study were provided with a 12-week Program Book outlining healthy lifestyle behaviors while women in the consultation groups were supported by a registered nurse who provide tailored health education and assisted with individual goal setting for exercise, healthy eating, smoking and alcohol consumption. Pre- and post-intervention data were collected on menopausal symptoms (Greene Climacteric Scale), health related quality of life (SF12), and modifiable lifestyle factors.Linear mixed-effect models showed an average 0.87 and 1.23 point reduction in anxiety (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and depression scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) over time in all groups.

Back and knee basal pain was recorded using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at each control and exercise-induced pain was recorded using a visual rating system (VRS). Changes in QoL were evaluated using the SF-36 questionnaire.In patients treated with OHC, mean VAS and VRS pain scores decreased significantly after 5 and 6 months of treatment, indicating a significant analgesic effect. In the CC group, however, changes were minor and non-significant. Two-way analysis of variance using treatment group and time as independent variables revealed a significantly greater effect of OHC over CC on VAS and VRS scores. SF-36 showed significant improvement for OHC on the physical component summary score and no changes for CC. Responses to items assessing emotional and social aspects of QoL showed only a significant improvement in vitality for OHC and no significant changes for CC in any of the four dominions constituting the SF-36 mental component.OHC has a significant analgesic effect and improves the physical component of QoL to a greater extent than CC.",

The peri and postmenopausal period constitutes a challenging transition time for women's health, and menopausal health is a crucial aspect in healthy and successful aging. Currently, no framework for the concept of healthy menopause exists, despite its recognized importance. Therefore, we aimed to: (i) characterize healthy menopause; (ii) identify aspects that contribute to it; and (iii) explore potential approaches to measure it.We propose healthy menopause as a dynamic state, following the permanent loss of ovarian function, which is characterized by self-perceived satisfactory physical, psychological and social functioning, incorporating disease and disability, allowing the attainment of a woman's desired ability to adapt and capacity to self-manage. The concept of healthy menopause applies to all women from the moment they enter the menopausal transition, up until they reach early and late postmenopause and includes women with spontaneous, iatrogenic, and premature menopause.This conceptualization can be considered as a further step in the maintenance and improvement of health in menopausal women from different perspectives, foremost the woman's own perspective, followed by the clinical, public health, and societal perspectives, and can be seen as a further step in delineating lines for future research. Furthermore, it could facilitate the improvement of adequate preventive and treatment strategies, guide scientific efforts, and aid education and communication to health care practitioners and the general public, allowing women the achievement of their potential and the fulfillment of their fundamental role in society.",

For walking balance assessments, the gait outcomes derived generally demonstrated good to excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient >0.75), but their ability to predict falls varied. Outcomes derived from the cognitive tasks and the dual-task cost (dual-task performance minus single-task performance) mostly demonstrated low to fair reliability. The methodological quality of majority of studies was poor to fair, mainly due to small sample size.Among the dual-task balance assessments examined, the reliability and validity varied.

Lymphoedema is one such sequela, with wide-ranging implications, from serious functional and psychological effects at the individual level to wider economic burdens to society.Breast cancer-related lymphoedema is principally managed by conservative therapy comprising compression garments and manual decongestive massage. This approach is effective for early stages of lymphoedema, but it is not curative and the effectiveness depends on patient compliance. Early surgical approaches were ablative, gave significant morbidity and hence, reserved for the most severe cases of refractory lymphoedema. However, recent non-ablative reconstructive surgical approaches have seen a revival of interest in the prevention or surgical management of breast cancer-related lymphoedema.This review examines the modern surgical techniques for the treatment of breast cancer-related lymphoedema. Liposuction reduces the volume and symptoms of lymphedema, but requires continual compressive therapy to avoid recurrence. Lymphatic reconstruction or bypass techniques including lymph node transfer (inguinal nodes are transferred to the affected limb), lymphatico-lymphatic bypass (lymphatics bypass the axilla using a lymph vessel graft reconstructing lymphatic flow from arm to neck) and lymphaticovenous anastomoses (lymphatics in the arm are joined to the venous system aiding lymph drainage) show promise in reducing lymphedema significantly. Further research is required, including into the role of primary lymphaticovenous anastomoses in the prevention of lymphedema at the time of axillary dissection.",

This study aimed to examine the prevalence of lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities by recently updated menopausal stages in middle-aged women.This study was cross-sectional analysis of 1553 women aged 44\u201356 years, who underwent a comprehensive health screening examination in the Kangbuk Samsung Hospital Total Healthcare Centers, Korea, during 2012\u20132013. Lipid and lipoprotein profiles including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)), apolipoprotein A1 (Apo A1), apolipoprotein B (Apo B) were assessed. Prevalence ratios and 95% confidence intervals for lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities were estimated by menopausal stages as defined by the 2011 Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop\u00a0+\u00a010 criteria.Increased prevalence of lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities were observed across menopausal stages. The increased prevalence of high non-HDL-C was associated with the late menopausal transition and post-menopausal stages and was more pronounced in women with body mass index (BMI) <23\u00a0kg/m2 than in those with BMI \u226523\u00a0kg/m2 (P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.006).

Ongoing needs include defining what constitutes \u201cgender equal,\u201d understanding the continuum of gender identity, and establishing and implementing guidelines for gender equal counseling and care.With the routine practice of defining sex at birth and equating sex with gender in the health care setting, the transgender patient encounters multiple barriers to accessing and acquiring health care services.

Secondary analyses will compare the two active doses (both separately and when combined) with placebo. Additional end-points include biochemical assessments of safety, blood pressure, arterial stiffness, falls, fractures, heel and wrist bone density, grip strength and physical performance and echocardiographic assessments of cardiac function in a random sample of participants.About one-third of eligible participants agreed to participate in the trial. The mean age was 72 (SD 6) years with equal numbers of men and women. About one third reported a prior history of fracture or hypertension, one-fifth reported a prior cardiovascular event, and one tenth reported diabetes or a fall in the previous 6 months.The results of this trial will help determine the optimum dose of vitamin D to test in a larger trial investigating whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce the risk of fractures, cardiovascular disease or cancer.",

     "abstract": "Current guidelines recommend that hormone therapy (HT) in postmenopausal women with a uterus include a progestin to protect against endometrial hyperplasia. However, many concerns relating to HT use appear to be related to the progestin component, including cardiovascular risk, breast stimulation, and irregular vaginal bleeding. Conjugated estrogens (CE) combined with the selective estrogen receptor modulator bazedoxifene (BZA) is a new progestin-free HT option for alleviating estrogen deficiency symptoms in postmenopausal women with a uterus for whom treatment with progestin-containing therapy is not appropriate. Five double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies, known as the Selective estrogens, Menopause, And Response to Therapy (SMART) trials have investigated the efficacy of CE/BZA for relieving vasomotor symptoms (VMS), and effect on bone mass, as well as endometrial and breast safety in postmenopausal women. In a 12-week study, CE 0.45\u00a0mg/BZA 20\u00a0mg significantly reduced the number and severity of hot flushes compared with placebo at weeks 4 and 12. Unlike estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT), CE 0.45\u00a0mg/BZA 20\u00a0mg did not increase breast density compared with placebo. In clinical trials up to 2 years, CE/BZA had a favorable tolerability profile, demonstrated by amenorrhea rates similar to placebo. Vascular disorders including venous thromboembolic events (pulmonary embolism, retinal vein thrombosis, deep vein thrombosis, and thrombophlebitis) were rare events, occurring in less than 1 per 1000 patients. CE/BZA was associated with significantly higher incidences of amenorrhea and lower incidences of bleeding compared with CE/medroxyprogesterone acetate in 2 comparative trials. Therefore, CE 0.45\u00a0mg/BZA 20\u00a0mg provides an effective, well-tolerated, progestin-free alternative to EPT for postmenopausal women with a uterus.",

In this paper we review the published literature on cartilage aging and propose the term \u201cchondrosenescence\u201d to define the age-dependent deterioration of chondrocyte function and how it undermines cartilage function in osteoarthritis. We propose the concept that a small number of senescent chondrocytes may be able to take advantage of the inflammatory tissue microenvironment and the inflammaging and immunosenescence that is concurrently occurring in the arthritic joint, further contributing to the age-related degradation of articular cartilage, subchondral bone, synovium and other tissues. In this new framework \u201cchondrosenescence\u201d is intimately linked with inflammaging and the disturbed interplay between autophagy and inflammasomes, thus contributing to the age-related increase in the prevalence of osteoarthritis and a decrease in the efficacy of articular cartilage repair. A better understanding of the basic mechanisms underlying chondrosenescence and its modification by drugs, weight loss, improved nutrition and physical exercise could lead to the development of new therapeutic and preventive strategies for osteoarthritis and a range of other age-related inflammatory joint diseases. Aging is inevitable but age-related diseases may be modifiable.",

     "abstract": "There is a growing body of evidence supporting the use of anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) serum levels as a biomarker of the growing follicle pool, in turn taken to reflect the ovarian reserve, in patients being treated for cancer. Many cancer therapies are gonadotoxic, often inducing premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and thus rendering such patients infertile. The degree of ovariotoxicity is related to the type of treatment, dosage and patient's age. As survival rates from cancer improve, post-treatment reproductive health is becoming increasingly important to affected girls and women of reproductive age to allow them to have biologically-related children. AMH levels taken post-treatment may be able to guide advice regarding remaining reproductive lifespan and aid decision-making on suitable adjuvant hormonal treatments such as in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Furthermore, pre-treatment AMH levels are now shown to be predictive of long-term ovarian function. The development of prognostic scoring and classification methods including the use of pre-treatment AMH, as well as other patient factors including age, to determine the likelihood of return of menses may allow better individualisation of advice regarding the use of fertility preservation strategies prior to commencing cancer treatment. AMH may also be a useful marker of cancer therapy-related ovarian damage in pre-pubertal children, although there are very limited data on the relationship between AMH and the ovarian reserve in children and adolescents. AMH is proving to be of increasing value in assessing ovarian function and advising patients before and after cancer treatment.",

The aim of this narrative review is to identify studies investigating the association between Anti-M\u00fcllerian Hormone (AMH), a marker of ovarian reserve status, and factors of cardio-metabolic risk. Both for regularly cycling women and women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), current reports are conflicting and heterogeneous, with some indicating presence and others absence of a correlation between AMH and cardio-metabolic risk factors. The occurrence of hypertensive complications in pregnancy, known to increase the risk of later cardiovascular sequelae, is associated with reduced AMH levels in various study populations. Further research remains a prerequisite in order to further elucidate a possible common mechanism for ovarian and cardiovascular decline. More knowledge of the temporal or causal association between ovarian and cardiovascular decline may enable timely identification of women with increased risk of cardiovascular disease or early onset ovarian aging.

Regular physical activity reduces this risk by 24%. CRC risk derived from red meat intake is influenced by both total intake and its frequency. Fish consumption may decrease CRC risk by 12% whereas garlic intake is not significantly associated with reduced CRC risk. Intakes of more than 20\u00a0g/day of fiber are associated with a 25% reduction of CRC risk and 525\u00a0mL/day of milk reduces colon cancer risk by 26% in men.

The following factors were statistically significantly associated with vertebral fracture: age, late menarche, early menopause, diabetes mellitus, hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, height loss, daily physical activity, corticosteroid therapy, personal history of osteoporotic fracture and previous diagnosis of osteoporosis. The differences in Vogt score according to age and fracture status were statistically significant.The conclusion of the study is that vertebral osteoporotic fracture in the female Spanish population is frequent. The high prevalence in the Spanish population older than 60 years is probably related to malnutrition in the period from 1936 to 1952.",

At baseline (T0) and 30 days post-treatment (T1), vaginal status of the women was evaluated using the Vaginal Health Index (VHI), and subjective intensity of VVA symptoms was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). At T1, treatment satisfaction was evaluated using a 5-point Likert scale.During the study period, a total of 48 patients were enrolled. Data indicated a significant improvement in VVA symptoms (vaginal dryness, burning, itching and dyspareunia) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in patients who had undergone 3 sessions of vaginal fractional CO2 laser treatment. Moreover, VHI scores were significantly higher at T1 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Overall, 91.7% of patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure and experienced considerable improvement in quality of life (QoL). No adverse events due to fractional CO2 laser treatment occurred.Thermo-ablative fractional CO2 laser could be a safe, effective and feasible option for the treatment of VVA symptoms in post-menopausal women.",

Although some studies have identified the superiority of various anthropometric indices to assess general health outcomes, very limited studies have compared the efficacy of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) to predict subclinical atherosclerosis according to menopausal status.In total, 442 participants (209 premenopausal women and 233 postmenopausal women) were prospectively enrolled from the Health Promotion Center of Korea University Guro Hospital. We examined subclinical atherosclerosis using carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV).In premenopausal women, all anthropometric parameters such as BMI, WC and WHR were positively correlated with baPWV and CIMT values, whereas in postmenopausal women, only WHR was positively correlated with baPWV values (0.27, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and WC and WHR were positively correlated with CIMT (0.15, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 and 0.21, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, respectively). By receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, WHR was superior to the other anthropometric indices to predict carotid atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, the normal weight (BMI\u00a0<\u00a023\u00a0kg/m2) with higher WHR group had a significantly thicker CIMT when compared to the normal weight with lower WHR group (0.76\u00a0mm vs. 0.68\u00a0mm, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and even the overweight subjects with BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a023\u00a0kg/m2 (0.76\u00a0mm vs. 0.70\u00a0mm, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in postmenopausal women.The present study shows that WHR has the best potential for predicting subclinical atherosclerosis compared to BMI and WC in postmenopausal women.NCT01594710.",

Vitamin D deficiency (<50\u00a0nmol/L) is a worldwide epidemic with multiple implications on human health, due to its role in various physiological systems. Various studies have shown that with higher serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels, there is a decrease in the incidence of non-vertebral and hip fractures. There is limited research data on the management of vitamin D deficiency using therapeutic doses. The majority of studies focus on lower physiological doses rather than high pharmacological doses. In order to reach serum levels of 75\u00a0nmol/L from a deficiency state, higher doses than 800\u20131000\u00a0IU/day are required. Future focus should be on the implications of a rise in systemic 25(OH)D3 levels from a deficiency state to 75\u00a0nmol/L on bone density and fracture risk, and the use of high doses in cases of vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D treatment and supplementation need to be re-evaluated in the light of new evidence suggesting that high pharmacological doses need to be used in order to obtain the desired effect in the prevention of osteoporosis and recurrence of osteoporotic fractures.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia, obesity, and osteoporosis are three interrelated entities which may share common pathophysiological factors. In the last decades, overall survival has drastically increased. Postmenopausal women, due to their estrogen depletion, are at higher risk of developing any of these three conditions or the three, which is termed osteosarcopenic obesity. One of the most common health problems among these patients is the elevated risk of falls and fractures. Falls and fall-related injuries are one of the major causes of mortality and morbidity in older adults, and have a significant impact on social, economical and health-related costs. Several extrinsic and intrinsic risk factors have been described that play a role in the etiology of falls. A therapeutic approach to osteosarcopenic obesity aimed at the prevention of falls must include several factors, and act on those risk elements which can be effectively modified. An adequate weight-loss diet and a good nutritional intake, with an appropriate amount of vitamin D and the right protein/carbohydrates ratio, may contribute to the prevention of falls. The recommendation of physical exercise, both traditional (resistance or aerobic training) and more recent varieties (Tai Chi, Pilates, body vibration), can improve balance and positively contribute to fall prevention, whether by itself or in combination with other therapeutic strategies. Finally, a pharmacological approach, especially one focused on hormone therapy, has shown to have a positive effect on postmenopausal women's balance, leading to a decreased risk of falls.",

While clinical evidence is sparse regarding the benefit of estrogen therapy for women at risk for MS exacerbations, scientific data demonstrates that estrogen potentiates numerous neuroprotective effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Estrogens play a wide range of roles involved in MS disease pathophysiology, including increasing antiinflammatory cytokines, decreasing demyelination, and enhancing oxidative and energy producing processes in CNS cells.",

Frailty was measured with the frailty index and physical activity was measured using ActiGraph accelerometers.On average, people engaged in about 8.5\u00a0h of sedentary behaviour each day. The most frail individuals were more sedentary and less likely to meet weekly MVPA guidelines (9.57\u00a0h/day; 8.3%) than non-frail individuals (8.18\u00a0h/day; 1.1%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Frail individuals failed to demonstrate the patterns of the healthier individuals\u2014higher levels of sedentary behaviour on Sundays and in the evenings and decreasing MVPA throughout the week. High sedentary behaviour and low MVPA were independently associated with higher levels of frailty, poor self-reported health, high ADL disability and higher healthcare usage.Many people over the age of 50, and most of those who are frail, were highly sedentary with very few meeting the recommended weekly levels of MVPA. Sedentary behaviour and MVPA were independently associated with frailty and adverse health outcomes in middle to older aged adults. Future research should focus on a longitudinal study to determine the temporal relationship between sedentary behaviour and frailty.",

Its pathogenesis involves a congenital reduction in the number of primordial follicles, poor follicle recruitment, or accelerated follicular apoptosis. However, its cause is unknown in most cases.This guide analyses the factors associated with the diagnosis and treatment of POI and provides recommendations on the most appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures for women under 40 years of age who experience POI.A panel of experts from various Spanish scientific societies related to POI (Spanish Menopause Society, Spanish Fertility Society, and Spanish Contraception Society) met to reach a consensus on these issues.Hormonal therapy (HT) is considered the treatment of choice to alleviate the symptoms of hypoestrogenism and to prevent long-term consequences. We suggest that HT should be continued until at least age 51, the average age at natural menopause. The best treatment to achieve pregnancy is oocyte/embryo donation. If a patient is to undergo treatment that will reduce her fertility, she should be informed of this issue and the available techniques to preserve ovarian function, mainly vitrification of oocytes.",

Conceptions like the so-called \u201cFrench paradox\u201d or the beneficial impact of the Mediterranean diet suggest benefit. Wine has a complex composition, which is affected by whether it is red or white or by other variables, like the variety of grapes or others. Alcohol and phenolic compounds have been attributed a participation in the benefits ascribed to wine. The case of alcohol has been extensively studied, but the key question is whether wine offers additional benefits. Resveratrol, a non-flavonoid compound, and quercetin, a flavonol, have received particular attention. There is much experimental work confirming a beneficial balance for both substances, particularly resveratrol, in various organs and systems. The pharmacological dosages used in many of those experiments have shed doubt, however, on the clinical translation of those findings. Clinical studies are limited by their observational nature as well as for the difficulties to abstract the benefits of wine from other confounders. Notwithstanding the doubts, there is reasonable unanimity in beneficial effects of moderate wine consumption in cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, maybe neurological diseases, and longevity. Observations are less enthusiastic in what refers to cancer. While considering these limitations, clinicians may spread the message that the balance of moderate wine consumption seems beneficial.",

Upwards of 40% of women report depression symptoms associated with menopause (Timur & Sahin, 2010) [1]. Treatments for menopausal depression include pharmacological agents such as antidepressants and hormone therapy (HT) as well as psychological approaches. This paper provides a review of cognitive-behavioral, behavioral, and mindfulness based (CBBMB) therapies in treating depression during the menopausal transition. After conducting an electronic database search, only two studies specifically using CBBMB methods were found, both had positive results. Since so few studies existed that specifically evaluated CBBMB treatments for menopausal depression (n\u00a0=\u00a02), a larger net was cast. Studies that assessed depression symptoms as an outcome measure in an evaluation of CBBMB treatments for hot flashes or menopausal symptoms more broadly, were included. The review revealed that interventions targeting hot flashes or menopausal symptoms using CBBMB methods mostly proved to have had a positive impact on depression symptoms in the mild range of severity. Directions for future research are discussed including the need for more CBBMB interventions targeting depression during the menopausal transition to establish their efficacy.",

     "abstract": "As the proportion of older people increases, so will chronic disease incidence and the proportion of the population living with disability. Therefore, new approaches to maintain health for as long as possible in this age group are required. Carotenoids are a group of polyphenolic compounds found predominantly in fruit and vegetables that have been proposed to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Such properties may impact on the risk diseases which predominate in older people, and also ageing-related physiological changes. Working out the effect of carotenoid intake versus fruit and vegetable intake is difficult, and the strong correlation between individual carotenoid intakes also complicates any attempt to examine individual carotenoid health effects. Similarly, research to determine whether carotenoids consumed as supplements have similar benefits to increased dietary intake through whole foods, is still required. However, reviewing the recent evidence suggests that carotenoid intake and status are relatively consistently associated with reduced CVD risk, although \u03b2-carotene supplementation does not reduce CVD risk and increases lung cancer risk. Increased lycopene intake may reduce prostate cancer progression, with a potential role for carotenoids at other cancer sites. Lutein and zeaxanthin have a plausible role in the maintenance of eye health, whilst an association between carotenoid intake and cognitive and physical health appears possible, although research is limited to date. Given this accruing evidence base to support a specific role for certain carotenoids and ageing, current dietary advice to consume a diet rich in fruit and vegetables would appear prudent, and efforts maintained to encourage increased intake.",

Platelet reactivity was measured by light transmission aggregometry. l-Arginine\u2013nitric oxide pathway was assessed measuring transmembrane l-[3H]-arginine transport, nitric oxide synthase activity by the citrulline assay, and arginase activity by the conversion of l-[14C]arginine to l-[14C]-urea. The activity of antioxidant enzymes was measured by spectrophotometric assays. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting.Platelet aggregation was increased in postmenopausal compared to premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women demonstrated reduced plasma levels of l-arginine, a lower nitric oxide synthase activity, similar endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, and a compensatory increase in l-arginine transmembrane transport. Arginase expression and activity did not differ between groups. In regard to oxidative stress, no differences between groups were observed NAPDH oxidase subunits expression and protein carbonylation. However, the activity of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase and catalase protein levels in platelets were higher in postmenopausal women.Postmenopausal women present increased platelet reactivity, which may be due to a reduction in intraplatelet nitric oxide synthesis.

Both, desphospho-uncarboxylated and total MGP (dp-ucMGP or t-ucMGP) were quantified by pre-commercial ELISA assays, developed by VitaK (Maastricht, The Netherland)Lp-PLA2 activity was independently positively associated with desphospho-uncarboxylated MGP (dp-ucMGP) [\u03b2 coeff\u00a0=\u00a00.098, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006]. 1SD of Lp-PLA2 activity was associated with 37% increased risk (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) of elevated dp-ucMGP (\u2265977\u00a0pmol/L, top quartile). In the Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for conventional risk factors, the patients in the highest quartile of dp-ucMGP or lowest quintile of total-uncarboxylated ucMGP (<2660\u00a0nmol/L) had higher risk of all-cause mortality [HRR 2.79 (95% CI 1.97\u20133.94) and HRR 1.69 (95% CI 1.18\u20132.42), respectively]. We observed no effect of high Lp-PLA2 activity (\u2265195\u00a0nmol/min/mL) on total mortality.We assume that Lp-PLA2 is involved in vascular calcification and that dp-ucMGP is a more appropriate biomarker of residual risk than Lp-PLA2 itself.",

Female interviewers were trained to undertake structured face-to-face interviews that incorporated both non-validated and several validated questionnaires, such as Question for Urinary Incontinence Diagnosis, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory, Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory and Menopause-Specific Quality of Life.We completed surveys of 1590 women, estimated age 30\u201359 years, between September 2013 and March 2014. We implemented several strategies to deal with low literacy and used the temporal relationship between marriage and childbirth, and the average age of onset of menarche, to estimate age. Cultural and religious sensitivities and personal security were managed by engaging community leaders, limiting activities to daylight hours, adopting local codes of dress, such as the wearing of head scarves. Our major challenges and experiences included difficulties in age determination, selection of and access to households, interview privacy, lack of basic and health literacy, transportation, political unrest and security of the interviewers.By anticipating challenges, we have been able to comprehensively survey a representative sample of Bangladeshi women. Disseminating information about the field challenges and experiences from the BMWHS should assist other researchers planning to conduct surveys about women's health issues in similar context.",

A composite measure of LEPF was calculated by summing Z-scores of the 6-min walk, 8-foot up-and-go and 30-s chair stand tests.Muscle quality and physical activity were associated with all measures of LEPF (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Relative adiposity was related to the 6-min walk and 30-s chair stand (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.01); lower-body mineral-free lean mass was not related to any measure of LEPF (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Hierarchical linear regression analyses revealed that muscle quality (standardized \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.47, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and relative adiposity (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-0.33, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were the strongest independent predictors of composite LEPF Z-score explaining 24% and 17% of the variance, respectively.Muscle quality and relative adiposity are the strongest independent predictors of LEPF in older women.

Concerning bone health, it seems that physical activity in the past can be protective against osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, but these data come from observational studies only. Also the cardiovascular system appears to benefit in older women from regular sport in the past. This refers mainly to better heart efficiency, and improved endothelial function and metabolic profile. The incidence of different types of neoplasms, especially breast cancer, is also decreased in former athletes. Professional sport, on the other hand, acts negatively on the pelvic floor and is a risk factor for urinary incontinence. The overall effect on mortality is difficult to assess, because of many parameters, such as the sport's intensity, variety of the sport and exposure to extreme danger in some disciplines. Also, caution should be kept in interpretation of the data because of the shortage of well-designed studies.",

Two studies showed favorable effects on response rate in post-stroke depression, while another two failed to do so. A meta-analysis, however, showed that GMDZ decoction produced better response rates than anti-depressants in post-stroke depression (RR: 1.17, I2\u00a0=\u00a015%).

Whether placebos are appropriate and effective in the management of chronic pain in older people deserves considerable attention. The evidence suggests that adults of any age are responsive to placebos, and that placebo treatments can be effective for many conditions prevalent in older people. Though placebos in general already seem to be used with some regularity in medical practice, the use of placebos alone for chronic pain is probably unjustified unless other treatments are inadvisable or have been exhausted. However maximising the mechanisms that underpin placebo analgesia such as expectancy or the psychosocial context should be encouraged and would be considered a feature of good clinical practice. It would also be anticipated that older people may see an additional benefit with placebo treatments when such treatments reduce existing or planned medication regimes, as older people typically experience more comorbidities, increased susceptibility to adverse drug reactions, and altered pharmacological responses to drugs. Further research is still needed in placebo-related treatment paradigms for the management of chronic pain in older people.",

A narrative synthesis was used to analyse the results due to high level of heterogeneity across the included studies. Overall, review of eligible studies showed a small increased risk of self-reported sleep disturbance as women go through the menopausal transition after adjustment of potential confounders. Although the methodological quality of the majority of included studies was classified as high, the impact of culture on this relationship could not be explored, as all of the included studies were conducted in western countries.

Of these, 105 women died from breast cancer during a median follow-up of 6.3 years (range 0.2\u201314.3 years).

Pre-diagnostic HRT use was associated with smaller tumour size at the time of diagnosis and a higher frequency of receptor positive breast cancer. Paradoxically, a high pre-diagnostic intake of vitamin D supplements was associated with HRT use but also with a higher BC specific mortality (HR: 1.47; 95% CI, 1.07\u20132.00)HRT use at enrolment was associated with breast tumours of smaller size at the time of diagnosis and positive receptor status, and with a lower BC mortality. The found association between vitamin D from supplements and higher BC mortality warrants further exploration.",

The aim of our research was to study the relationship between LDD and BMD of the lumbar spine and femoral neck.The study population consisted of 168 postmenopausal women (aged 63.3\u201375.0 years, mean 68.6 years) from the prospective OSTPRE and OSTPRE-FPS study cohorts. The severity of LDD was graded from T2-weighted MRI images using the five-grade Pfirrmann classification. Four vertebral levels (L1-L4) were studied (total 672 discs). The association between lumbar BMD and Z-score and the severity of LDD was studied separately for each vertebral level with AN(C)OVA analysis, using potential confounders as covariates.Higher lumbar BMD and Z-score were associated with more severe LDD at all studied levels (L1-L4): between L4-L5 disc and L4 BMD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.044) and L4 Z-score (p\u00a0=\u00a00.052), between L2-L3 disc and L3 BMD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and at all other levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The mean degeneration grade of the studied discs was associated with the mean L1-L4 BMD and Z-score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Statistical significance of any result did not alter after controlling for confounding factors. There was no significant association between femoral neck BMD and LDD.Higher lumbar BMD/Z-score were associated with more severe LDD. There was no significant association between femoral neck BMD and disc degeneration. Femoral neck BMD may be a more reliable measurement for diagnosing osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with degenerative changes in the lumbar spine.",

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been found to be an effective treatment for HFNS in women, but cognitions and behavioural reactions to HFNS in men are under-researched. This study describes the development of the HFNS beliefs and behaviour scale for men.HFNS beliefs and behaviour items were generated from a qualitative study, from pilot interviews with men with prostate cancer and HFNS, and from scales used for women. 118 men with prostate cancer, aged above 18, English-speaking, who had minimum of seven HFNS weekly for at least 1 month, completed the initial measure, and measures of HFNS frequency, problem rating, anxiety and depression (HADS). Principal components analyses with orthogonal rotation determined the most coherent solution.Exploratory factor analysis culminated in a 17-item HFNS beliefs and behaviour scale for men (HFBBS-Men) with three subscales: (1) HFNS social context and sleep, (2) Calm/Acceptance, (3) Humour/Openness. The subscales had reasonable internal consistency (Cronbach alpha 0.56\u20130.83). Validity was supported, by correlations between subscale 1, HFNS frequency, problem-rating and mood; men with locally advanced cancer more likely to adopt Calm/Acceptance and those with metastatic cancer Humour/Openness.Preliminary analysis of the HFBBS-Men suggests that it is a psychometrically sound instrument, grounded in men's experiences. As a measure of cognitive and behavioural reactions to HF/NS, the HFBBS-Men should increase understanding of the mediators of outcomes of psychological interventions, such as CBT.",

     "abstract": "Vitamin E is known to be the most important antioxidant in the body, protecting against the effects of toxic radicals. The main idea behind the studies on vitamin E and bone metabolism stems from the concept that oxidative stress may interfere with the bone formation activity of osteoblasts which in turn can lead to osteoporosis. This mini-review, summarizes the studies on the effects of vitamin E on bone mineral density, fracture risk, bone formation, and resorption markers in perimenopausal women. Current evidence does not the support daily use of vitamin E for protection against osteoporosis and hip fracture risk in perimenopausal women. However some benefit has been shown in some observational studies. Low vitamin E (>6.2\u00a0mg/day) intake seems to be associated with an OR of 3.0 of hip fracture in current smokers. Compared with the highest quintile of alpha-tocopherol intake, the lowest quintile of intake conferred a multivariable-adjusted HR of 1.86 for hip fracture and 1.20 for any fracture. Alpha-tocopherol supplementation may alter the alpha-tocopherol/gamma-tocopherol ratio; which in turn may be associated with decreased osteoblastic activity. Interventional studies, especially randomized controlled trials (RCT), evaluating a possible causal relationship between serum vitamin E levels and BMD and hip fracture risk in perimenopausal women are needed.",

Until recently, bone mineral density (BMD) was the primary factor used to determine which postmenopausal women may require osteoporosis treatment. However, clinical guidelines now recommend the use of the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX\u00ae), a computer-based algorithm introduced by the World Health Organization, to help primary care physicians identify postmenopausal women who may be candidates for pharmacological osteoporosis therapy based on the level of fracture risk. Beyond its utility as a resource for determining whether or not to initiate osteoporosis treatment, clinical studies have begun to evaluate the correlation between FRAX\u00ae-based 10-year fracture probability and efficacy of different osteoporosis treatments. Bazedoxifene, clodronate, and denosumab have shown greater fracture risk reduction at higher FRAX\u00ae-based 10-year fracture probabilities, but the efficacy of raloxifene, alendronate, and strontium ranelate were relatively stable regardless of fracture probability.

As life expectancy is increasing the health of older skin is becoming a progressively more important facet of overall care. In addition to the consequences of ageing for otherwise healthy skin, the relative incidence of some dermatological conditions is age-dependent. In particular, xerosis (dry skin), cutaneous malignancies and skin injuries are more common in older people. In this review we describe the functional consequences of skin ageing and discuss the current evidence on how skin health may be maintained and dermatological conditions prevented in an ageing population. The future of dermatological health-care provision in the older population relies on the development of coordinated pathways of care, which start from a young age. Better quality research coordinated by the establishment of institutions dealing with skin health and ageing would be a method of addressing these needs.",

     "abstract": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus has recently been linked to an increased fracture risk. Since bone mass seems to be normal to elevated in patient with type 2 diabetes, the increased fracture risk is thought to be due to both an increased falling frequency and decreased bone quality. The increased falling frequency is mainly a result of complications of the disease such as a retinopathy and polyneuropathy. Bone quality is affected through changes in bone shape, bone micro-architecture, and in material properties such as bone mineralization and the quality of collagen. Commonly used methods for predicting fracture risk such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry and fracture risk assessment tools are helpful in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, but underestimate the absolute fracture risk for a given score. New imaging modalities such as high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography are promising for giving insight in the complex etiology underlying the fragility of the diabetic bone, as they can give more insight into the microarchitecture and geometry of the bone. We present an overview of the contributing mechanisms to the increased fracture risk and the usefulness of imaging modalities and risk assessment tools in predicting fracture risk in patients with type 2 diabetes.",

We studied 12 OP patients and 13 OA patients. We analyzed BTM (\u03b2-CrossLaps and PINP), BMD and microstructural and biomechanical parameters (micro-CT). Our results were: OP group has higher levels of \u03b2-CrossLaps and lower BMD at the femoral neck. Also, OP patients have a decreased volume of trabecular bone and less trabecular number, with architecture showing prevalence of rod-like trabeculae and worse connectivity than OA patients. The biomechanical parameters were worse in OP patients. BMD was correlated with almost all the structural and biomechanical parameters. Moreover, \u03b2-CrossLaps was negatively correlated with hip BMD and with bone surface density and positively with trabecular separation. BTM, BMD and bone microstructural changes in osteoporosis are opposite to those of OA. These findings justify a less resistant bone with higher risk of fragility fractures in OP patients. These histomorphometric and biomechanical changes may be suspected by measuring of BMD and \u03b2-CrossLaps levels.",

The presence of MetS was significantly higher in women with POI. The subcutaneous, preperitoneal and visceral fat thicknesses were not significantly different between the groups.Early cessation of ovulatory function may associated with higher levels of serum TC and HDL-C, but does not seem to cause differences in abdominal fat distribution in women with POI. POI is associated with higher risk of MetS.",

GSM is defined as a collection of symptoms and signs associated with a decrease in estrogen and other sex steroids involving changes to the labia majora/minora, clitoris, vestibule/introitus, vagina, urethra and bladder. The syndrome may include but is not limited to genital symptoms of dryness, burning, and irritation; sexual symptoms of lack of lubrication, discomfort or pain, and impaired function; and urinary symptoms of urgency, dysuria and recurrent urinary tract infections. Women may present with some or all of the signs and symptoms, which must be bothersome and should not be better accounted for by another diagnosis.

     "abstract": "Depression is a common disorder in later life that is associated with increased disability and costs, and negative health outcomes over time. Antidepressant treatments in the form of medications or psychotherapy are available, but a large proportion of those treated fail to respond fully, and relapse or recurrence of symptoms is frequent among those who recover. Hence, successful prevention would avoid these negative outcomes. This paper selectively reviews currently available observational and trial data on the prevention of depression. It initially reviews risk factors associated with depression, and then discusses strategies for primary (including universal, selective and indicated), secondary and tertiary prevention. Currently available evidence suggests that selective and indicated preventive interventions are feasible and initial results look promising. Existing trial data indicate that ongoing antidepressant treatments reduce the risk of relapse and recurrence of symptoms, but benefits may not extend beyond two or three years. At this point in time, no interventions have been shown to reduce the long term complications associated with depression. Mental health professionals will need to work collaboratively to develop primary, secondary and tertiary preventive interventions that are effective at targeting relevant risk factors systematically and that can be easily adopted into clinical practice.",

     "abstract": "Late-life depression is highly prevalent worldwide. In addition to being a debilitating illness, it is a risk factor for excess morbidity and mortality. Older adults with depression are at risk for dementia, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer and suicide. Individuals with late-life depression often have significant medical comorbidity and, poor treatment adherence. Furthermore, psychosocial considerations such as gender, ethnicity, stigma and bereavement are necessary to understand the full context of late-life depression.The fact that most older adults seek treatment for depression in primary care settings led to the development of collaborative care interventions for depression. These interventions have consistently demonstrated clinically meaningful effectiveness in the treatment of late-life depression. We describe three pivotal studies detailing the management of depression in primary care settings in both high and low-income countries. Beyond effectively treating depression, collaborative care models address additional challenges associated with late-life depression. Although depression treatment interventions are effective compared to usual care, they exhibit relatively low remission rates and small to medium effect sizes.Several studies have demonstrated that depression prevention is possible and most effective in at-risk older adults. Given the relatively modest effects of treatment in averting years lived with disability, preventing late-life depression at the primary care level should be highly prioritized as a matter of health policy.",

In this paper we review the research literature on both the epidemiology and management of depression in the older medical patient. After a general overview of depression in the elderly, we discuss some of the particular issues relevant to depression and co-morbid physical illness amongst elderly patients. Depression can be difficult to diagnose in medically unwell older adults, particularly when there is substantial overlap in symptomatology. The epidemiology and evidence base for the treatment of depression in a number of chronic health problems common in an older adults population are then discussed, specifically cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Parkinson's disease. For many of these conditions there is emerging evidence that treatments can be effective in reducing depressive symptoms. However, these potential benefits need to be balanced against the often-increased risk of adverse events or interactions with medical treatments. Although co-morbid depression is consistently associated with poorer medical outcomes, there is limited evidence that standard anti-depressive therapy has additional benefits in terms of physical health outcomes. Collaborative care models appear particularly well suited to medically unwell older adult patients, and may provide more generalised benefits across both mental and physical health measures.",

Therefore, we conducted an updated meta-analysis of these studies. A total of 44 studies comparing psychotherapies to control groups, other therapies or pharmacotherapy could be included. The overall effect size indicating the difference between psychotherapy and control groups was g\u00a0=\u00a00.64 (95% CI: 0.47\u20130.80), which corresponds with a NNT of 3. These effects were maintained at 6 months or longer post randomization (g\u00a0=\u00a00.27; 95%CI: 0.16\u20130.37). Specific types of psychotherapies that were found to be effective included cognitive behavior therapy (g\u00a0=\u00a00.45; 95% CI: 0.29\u20130.60), life review therapy (g\u00a0=\u00a00.59; 95% CI: 0.36\u20130.82) and problem-solving therapy (g\u00a0=\u00a00.46; 95% CI: 0.18\u20130.74). Treatment compared to waiting list control groups resulted in larger effect sizes than treatments compared to care-as-usual and other control groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Studies with lower quality resulted in higher effect sizes than high-quality studies (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Direct comparisons between different types of psychotherapy suggested that cognitive behavior therapy and problem-solving therapy may be more effective than non-directive counseling and other psychotherapies may be less effective than other therapies. This should be considered with caution, however, because of the small number of studies. There were not enough studies to examine the long-term effects of psychotherapies and to compare psychotherapy with pharmacotherapy or combined treatments. We conclude that it is safe to assume that psychological therapies in general are effective in late-life depression, and this is especially well-established for cognitive behavior therapy and problem-solving therapy.",

The depression of Alzheimer's disease is probably not treated effectively with antidepressants. The most consistent evidence is for the effectiveness of continued antidepressant treatment in those depressed patients who respond well to acute treatment.

     "abstract": "Despite a general decline in late life suicide rates over the last 30 years, older people have the highest rates of suicide in most countries. In contrast, non-fatal suicidal behaviour declines with age and more closely resembles suicide than in younger age groups. There are difficulties in the detection and determination of pathological suicidal ideation in older people. Multiple factors increase suicide risk ranging from distal early and mid-life issues such as child abuse, parental death, substance misuse and traumatic life experiences to proximal precipitants in late life such as social isolation and health-related concerns. Clinical depression is the most frequently identified proximal mental health concern and in many cases is a first episode of major depression. Recent studies have identified changes on neuroimaging and neurocognitive factors that might distinguish suicidal from non-suicidal depression in older people. Strategies for suicide prevention need to be \u2018whole of life\u2019 and, as no single prevention strategy is likely to be successful alone, a multi-faceted, multi-layered approach is required. This should include optimal detection and management of depression and of high risk individuals as available evidence indicates that this can reduce suicidal behaviour.

There is also evidence to support both conditions showing similar neurobiological changes, particularly white matter disease, either indicating shared risk factors or a shared pattern of neuronal damage.These findings highlight the need to examine if effective treatment of depressive episodes has any effect in reducing the prevalence of dementia, as well as clinicians being vigilant for late life depression indicating the incipient development of dementia, and therefore carefully following up these individuals for future cognitive impairment.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, dementia has been considered a public health priority and become a topic of major political interest. Recent reviews and studies have reported with varying degrees of alarm an impending and existing \u201cdementia epidemic\u201d with increasing predicted trends in prevalence and enormous numbers of people with dementia particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, robust evidence from dementia research in high-income countries suggests stable or decreased prevalence over the last decades. Current evidence is not sufficient to suggest increasing trends of prevalence in LMICs once variation in methodological factors and study populations are taken into account. Changes in diagnostic methods over the last decades substantially influence the identification of dementia cases with systematic difference between the resulting individual prevalence studies. Potential geographical variations at the country level might indicate potential risk factors at population levels or systematic difference in clinical application of dementia diagnosis. Although it is important and necessary to use information from dementia research for evidence-based policymaking, over-interpretation of results without carefully considering underlying factors could exaggerate the findings and influence policy planning in ways which do not serve current and future population best. Planning of dementia policy needs to take full cognisance of the provenance of the data being used and be integrated with policies which optimise health across the lifecourse.",

Apolipoprotein E genotype is equally common in men and women but has a stronger effect in women. Apolipoprotein E genotype is a biological factor that cannot be modified but interacts with sex or gender related factors that can be modified. Low education has a similar harmful effect in men and women but has been historically more common in women. Education is a social factor related to gender that can be modified. Finally, bilateral oophorectomy is a factor restricted to women. Bilateral oophorectomy is a surgical practice related to sex that can be modified. Consideration of risk and protective factors in men and women separately may accelerate etiologic research for neurological diseases in general, and for dementia and AD in particular. Similarly, future preventive interventions for dementia should be tailored to men and women separately.",

Whilst cognitive impairment is central to the dementia concept, neuropsychiatric symptoms are invariably present at some stage of the illness. Neuropsychiatric symptoms result in a number of negative outcomes for the individual and their caregivers and are associated with higher rates of institutionalization and mortality. A number of factors have been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms including neurobiological changes, dementia type, and illness severity and duration. Specific patient, caregiver and environmental factors are also important. Neuropsychiatric symptoms can be broadly divided into four clusters: psychotic symptoms, mood/affective symptoms, apathy, and agitation/aggression. Neuropsychiatric symptoms tend to persist over time although differing symptom profiles exist at various stages of the illness. Assessment should take into account the presenting symptoms together with an appreciation of the myriad of likely underlying causes for the symptoms. A structured assessment/rating tool can be helpful. Management should focus on non-pharmacological measures initially with pharmacological approaches reserved for more troubling symptoms. Pharmacological approaches should target specific symptoms although the evidence-base for pharmacological management is quite modest. Any medication trial should include an adequate appreciation of the risk-benefit profile in individual patients and discussion of these with both the individual and their caregiver.",

It represents the second most frequent form of early-onset dementia. The two major types of FTD are determined by the localisation of the underlying pathology. The behaviour variant is characterised by disinhibition, socially inappropriate manners, loss of empathy, blunting of affect and hyperorality. Key features of the language variant are either non-fluent effortful speech and grammatical errors or impaired word finding and loss of meaning of words and objects. Histopathological changes are characterised by the abnormal processing of proteins including microtubule associated protein Tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein, and tumour-associated protein fused in sarcoma. The familial forms of FTD are caused by mutations in 5 genes. The diagnosis of FTD rests on careful history and psychiatric, neuropsychological and neurological examination supported by laboratory assessments and brain imaging. The management requires an interdisciplinary approach involving the carer and using non-pharmacological approaches in the first line. Current antidementia drugs, including cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine, have no consistent positive effects in FTD. Behavioural symptoms may respond favourably to selective serotonergic antidepressants. Antipsychotic agents should be used with caution regarding motor, cardiovascular and mortality risks.",

In light of this understanding, the cognitive impairment associated with cerebrovascular disease is an increasingly important and recognised area of the medicine of older people. Although the incidence of cerebrovascular events is declining in many populations, the overall burden associated with brain vascular disease will continue to increase associated with population ageing. A spectrum of cognitive disorders related to cerebrovascular disease is now recognised. Cerebrovascular disease in older people is associated with specific clinical and imaging findings. Although prevention remains the cornerstone of management, the diagnosis of brain vascular disease is important because of the potential to improve clinical outcomes through clear diagnosis, enhanced control of risk factors, lifestyle interventions and secondary prevention. Specific pharmacological intervention may also be indicated for some patients with cognitive impairment and cerebrovascular disease.

As men grow older, circulating levels of the principal androgen or male sex hormone testosterone (T) decline, while the prevalence of ill-health increases. Observational studies in middle-aged and older men have shown associations between lower levels of T and poorer mental health in older men, including worse cognitive performance, dementia and presence of depressive symptoms. The role of T metabolites, the more potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and the oestrogen receptor ligand estradiol (E2) in the pathophysiology of cognitive decline are unclear. Studies of men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy in the setting of prostate cancer have shown subtle detrimental effects of reduced T levels on cognitive performance. Randomised trials of T supplementation in older men have been limited in size and produced variable results, with some studies showing improvement in specific tests of cognitive function. Interventional data from trials of T therapy in men with dementia are limited. Lower levels of T have also been associated with depressive symptoms in older men. Some studies have reported an effect of T therapy to improve mood and depressive symptoms in men with low or low-normal T levels. T supplementation should be considered in men with a diagnosis of androgen deficiency. Beyond this clinical indication, further research is needed to establish the benefits of T supplementation in older men at risk of deteriorating cognition and mental health.",

     "abstract": "There is accumulating evidence that vitamin D (VD) has important effects besides its well-known role in calcium and bone metabolism. Hypovitaminosis D is associated with cardiovascular disease, the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cancer as well as with increased mortality. Further, VD deficiency is related to depression and impaired cognitive function. Increasing age and elevated body fat mass contribute to an increased risk of VD deficiency. Further, some studies report a relationship between VD and estrogen metabolism.During menopause, the decline of estrogens results in increased bone turnover, a decrease in bone mineral density and elevated fracture risk. Musculoskeletal discomfort might impair quality of life, mood disturbances do frequently occur and the risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease increases. Moreover, body composition changes including increased fat mass and decreased lean mass, which results in an increased risk of VD deficiency. Conversely, VD deficiency might aggravate discomfort as well as diseases that occur during menopause.There are precise recommendations regarding a sufficient VD intake in order to prevent bone loss in peri- and postmenopausal women. Considering the fact that VD deficiency and menopause share risk factors beyond bone health such as cardiovascular, metabolic, cognitive and affective disorders, a sufficient VD status should be obtained in all peri- and postmenopausal women. This might be beneficial not only considering bone health but also regarding cognitive, affective, metabolic and cardiovascular health of women.",

However, confusion remains about the amount, frequency, and duration of physical activity that is likely to provide maximum benefit as well as the way in which interventions should be delivered.This paper aimed to review research on the impact of leisure-time and general physical activity levels on physical and cognitive decline in postmenopausal women. In a systematic review of the literature, empirical literature from 2009 to 2013 is reviewed to explore the potential impact of either commencing or sustaining physical activity on older women's health.All studies found that physical activity was associated with lower rates of cognitive and physical decline and a significant reduction in all-cause mortality. In this review we found that exercise interventions (or lifestyle activities) that improved cardiorespiratory exercise capacity showed the most positive impact on physical health.Findings suggest that programs should facilitate and support women to participate in regular exercise by embedding physical activity programs in public health initiatives, by developing home-based exercise programs that require few resources and by creating interventions that can incorporate physical activity within a healthy lifestyle. The review also suggests that clinicians should consider prescribing exercise in a tailored manner for older women to ensure that it is of a high enough intensity to obtain the positive sustained effects of exercise.",

The evidence about drug treatments for chronic non-cancer pain is changing, driven by major improvements in understanding of clinical trial analysis and by the adoption of patient-centered outcomes of proven economic benefit. There is clear evidence of lack of useful effect, or insufficient evidence of effect for a number of commonly used drugs, including paracetamol, topical rubefacients, low concentration topical capsaicin, and for strong opioids in chronic non-cancer pain. In musculoskeletal pain there is evidence of efficacy for NSAIDs, tramadol, and tapentadol, and in neuropathic pain for duloxetine, pregabalin, and gabapentin, with weak evidence for amitriptyline. The new perspective is of drugs that work well in a minority of patients, but hardly at all in the remainder. The goal of treatment is large reductions in pain, by 50% or more. This outcome, and only this outcome, is associated with large benefits in terms of improved sleep, reduced depression, and large gains in function and quality of life. It is not possible to predict which patient will benefit from which drug, but early success or failure appears to be predictive of long-term success or failure. The emphasis is on stopping treatments that do not work and switching to other drugs in the same or different class, so that any potential future risk of treatment is balanced by very large and immediate benefit.",

The aim of the present review was to systematically present and discuss the up to date available research regarding the relationship between adherence to dietary patterns and stroke. Studies included were observational and randomized clinical trials. Internet searches until May 31, 2014, retrieved 152 potentially relevant papers; of them, 34 were excluded on the basis that did not report data on humans, 3 were in language other than English, 2 were excluded because they had a cross-sectional design, 3 because they reported data on secondary prevention and 82 were excluded on the basis of irrelevant research. One article was a recent meta-analysis on Mediterranean diet, stroke, cognitive impairment and depression and was used as a basis for a re-meta-analysis with the additional papers published after the publication of the later meta-analysis. The existing evidence suggests that adherence to healthy dietary patterns (i.e., Mediterranean or DASH or plant based \u201cprudent\u201d) was associated with reduced risk for stroke, whereas limited data exist supporting a detrimental effect of westernized dietary patterns. Moreover, the applied re-meta-analysis, based on a total sample of 195,875 participants enhanced the previously reported meta-analysis underlying a consistent, protective effect of higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet on stroke incidence (pooled relative risk 0.68, 95% CI 0.58, 0.79). Thus, a healthy dietary pattern exerts a beneficial effect on stroke incidence and mortality, adding a new direction toward stroke prevention on population level.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States with over 232,000 new diagnoses expected in 2014 and almost 40,000 deaths. While treatment of primary breast cancer is often well-managed with surgery and radiation, metastatic breast cancer (MBC) that has spread to the brain, bones, liver, and lungs is often incurable. One of the major challenges in the treatment of breast cancer is the presence of a subpopulation of cancer cells that are chemoresistant and metastatic. Given that metastasis is the driving force behind mortality for breast cancer patients, it is essential to identify the characteristics of these aberrant cancer cells that allow them to spread to distant sites in the body and develop into metastatic tumors. Understanding the metastatic mechanisms driving cancer cell dispersal will open the door to developing novel therapies that prevent metastasis and improve long-term outcomes for patients. In this review we assess the feasibility of targeting the Twist and Wnt signaling pathways in breast cancer. These pathways mediate epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that can give rise to chemoresistance. We review potential treatment strategies for targeting EMT and drug resistance as well as the problems that may arise with these targeted delivery therapeutic approaches. Finally, we examine recent advances in the field, including nanoparticle delivery and small interfering RNA (siRNA) technology, and discuss the impact that these approaches may have on translating much needed therapeutic approaches into the clinic, for the benefit of patients battling MBC.",

Indeed, men do show a decline of serum testosterone from age 40 to 50 years onwards but it is a slow decline of 1\u20132% per year and over time it may amount to hypogonadism. The mechanism of a decline in serum testosterone in men does not resemble the menopause; it is partially an aging neuroendocrine system with a less efficient testosterone production but equally or more important, the result of inhibition of testosterone production by metabolic factors in relation to visceral obesity. These effects are in part reversible with weight loss. A hypogonadal state in aging men has deleterious effects. Mortality of all causes is highest in men with low testosterone impacting on their metabolic state leading to diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and sexual dysfunction. Normalization of testosterone in aging hypogonadal men has a beneficial effect on the above pathologies. The fear that testosterone treatment of elderly men would lead to prostate disease has not been substantiated in studies.

A total of 131 males and 240 females, aged 65\u2013103 years, were enrolled. Physical activity (PA) and sedentary time were assessed with accelerometers and the risk for losing physical independence in later years was assessed with the self-reported composite physical function (CPF) scale adjusted for age. Participants were divided in two groups \u2013 high risk group (HRG) and low risk group (LRG), according current CPF. According to the multiple logistic regression analyses, sedentary time was not a significant predictor. The odds of a male participant being in the LRG were 12.19 times higher than those of a female (95% CI 5.06\u201329.39).

Age and gender interacted with moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) to predict the risk of losing physical independence. Thus, as age increases, participants that are more physically active became less likely (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.997; 95% CI 0.995\u20130.999) to be in the HRG than younger participants.

Fibroid-associated symptoms include heavy menstrual bleeding and pain or pelvic discomfort. The association between infertility and fibroids increases with age. Fibroids do not increase the risk of malignant uterine disease and leiomyosarcomas are extremely rare (less than one in 1000). It is unknown at present whether leiomyosarcoma represents de novo growth or malignant transformation from benign uterine fibroids. Treatment options for symptomatic fibroids include pharmacologic, surgical and radiologically guided interventions. The range of medical treatments allows flexible management of fibroid-related symptoms; the options include tranexamic acid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, contraceptive steroids, gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs, antiprogesterone, and selective progesterone receptor modulators. However, these medical options do not remove the tumors and symptoms may return when treatment is stopped. Surgical and radiologically guided procedures may be tailored to age, general health, and individual patient wishes. Hysterectomy is the most effective treatment, although in some cases myomectomy may be sufficient to control symptoms. Alternatives to surgery include uterine artery embolization, myolysis and ablation by high-intensity focused ultrasound (guided with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasound). The choice of treatment depends on fibroid size, the underlying symptoms and their severity and the woman's desire for subsequent fertility and pregnancy, as well as efficacy and need for repeated interventions.",

     "abstract": "From 50 years of age, postmenopausal women are at an increased risk of developing sarcopenia and osteoporosis as a result of deterioration of musculoskeletal health. Both disorders increase the risk of falls and fractures. The risk of developing sarcopenia and osteoporosis may be attenuated through healthy lifestyle changes, which include adequate dietary protein, calcium and vitamin D intakes, and regular physical activity/exercise, besides hormone replacement therapy when appropriate. Protein intake and physical activity are the main anabolic stimuli for muscle protein synthesis. Exercise training leads to increased muscle mass and strength, and the combination of optimal protein intake and exercise produces a greater degree of muscle protein accretion than either intervention alone. Similarly, adequate dietary protein intake and resistance exercise are important contributors to the maintenance of bone strength. Vitamin D helps to maintain muscle mass and strength as well as bone health. These findings suggest that healthy lifestyle measures in women aged >50 years are essential to allow healthy ageing. The European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis (ESCEO) recommends optimal dietary protein intake of 1.0\u20131.2\u00a0g/kg\u00a0body\u00a0weight/d with at least 20\u201325\u00a0g of high-quality protein at each main meal, with adequate vitamin D intake at 800\u00a0IU/d to maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels >50\u00a0nmol/L as well as calcium intake of 1000\u00a0mg/d, alongside regular physical activity/exercise 3\u20135 times/week combined with protein intake in close proximity to exercise, in postmenopausal women for prevention of age-related deterioration of musculoskeletal health.",

Gout is increasingly being recognised as a disease primarily of urate overload with arthritis being a consequence of this pathological accumulation. It is associated with a number of important co-morbidities including chronic kidney disease, obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.The prevalence of gout is increasing around the world. Significant progress has been made in determining the genetic basis for both gout and hyperuricaemia. Environmental risk factors for gout have been identified as certain foods, alcohol and several medications. There is, however, little evidence that changing these environmental risks improves gout on an individual level.Treatment of gout encompasses two strategies: firstly treatment of inflammatory arthritis with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, corticosteroids, colchicine or interleukin-1 inhibitors. The second and most important strategy is urate lowering, to a target of 0.36\u00a0mmol/L (6\u00a0mg/dL) or potentially lower in those with tophi (collections of crystalline urate subcutaneously). Along with urate lowering, adequate and prolonged gout flare prophylaxis is required to prevent the precipitation of acute attacks. Newer urate lowering agents are in development and have the potential to significantly expand the potential treatment options. Education of patients regarding the importance of life long urate lowering therapy and prophylaxis of acute attacks is critical to treatment success as adherence with medication is low in chronic diseases in general but especially in gout.",

Furthermore, it is shown to be useful as a tool in the multi-disciplinary treatment of health problems common in later life such as depression and dementia. There are a number of initiatives to encourage older people to participate in creative activities such as arts-based projects which may range from visual arts to dance to music to intergenerational initiatives. However, participation shows geographical variation and often the responsibility of provision falls to voluntary organisations.Overall, the literature presented suggests that creative activity could be a useful tool for individuals and society.

The top association signal was found for SNP rs2018736 (protective effect for the minor allele A) in the entire set: p\u00a0=\u00a00.0026, OR\u00a0=\u00a00.42, 95% CI: 0.24\u20130.75; in the stratum with pelvic floor trauma: p\u00a0=\u00a00.0018, OR\u00a0=\u00a00.27, 95% CI: 0.11\u20130.64; and in the stratum with fetal macrosomia: p\u00a0=\u00a00.013, OR\u00a0=\u00a00.14, 95% CI: 0.03\u20130.71. The results of the haplotype analyses were consistent with the single SNP analysis. In the strata without perineal trauma and fetal macrosomia effects were non-significant, possibly, due to the smaller effect sizes.Current data provide, for the first time, strong evidence that common SNPs of the FBLN5 gene are associated with POP especially after pelvic floor injury.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of self-compassion, defined as healthy way of relating toward the self when dealing with difficult experiences, as a potential moderator of the relationship between HFNS and daily life activities, which in turn influences symptoms of depression.This was a cross-sectional study using questionnaire data from 206 women aged 40\u201360 who were currently experiencing hot flushes and/or night sweats. Path analysis was used to model relationships among menopausal factors (HFNS frequency and daily interference ratings), self-compassion and mood.Hot flush interference in daily activities and depressive symptoms.On average, women experienced 4.02 HFNS per day, and HFNS frequency was moderately correlated with interference ratings (r\u00a0=\u00a00.38). In the path analytic model, self-compassion made significant direct contribution to hot flush interference ratings (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.37) and symptoms of depression (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.42), and higher self-compassion was associated with lower interference and depressive symptoms. Self-compassion also moderated the relationship between HFNS frequency and hot flush interference. Higher self-compassion was associated with weaker effects of HFNS frequency on daily interference.Self-compassion may weaken the association between HFNS and daily life functioning, which in turn, could lead to less HFNS-related mood problems. These findings imply that self-compassion may be a resilience factor to help women manage hot flushes and night sweats.",

The aim of this cross-sectional population-based study was to explore the association between common carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT), carotid artery calcification (CAC), and BMD in postmenopausal women. In addition, the association of postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) and selected diseases with cIMT and carotid calcification was studied.The 290 women (mean age 73.6 years) included in this Bone Brain Atherosclerosis study (OSTPRE-BBA) were randomly selected from the population-based Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) study cohort, Finland.For this cross-sectional study, cIMT was measured with B-mode ultrasound; femoral neck and total body BMD were measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry.There were no statistically significant associations between mean cIMT and femoral neck T-score (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). However, an increased maximum cIMT was significantly associated with low femoral neck T-score.

We used latent class growth modelling (LCGM) to identify underlying subgroups (clusters) with distinct trajectories of PF. Next, we characterized these subgroups and applied multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify prognostic indicators for deterioration in PF.We measures PF with the RAND-36 PF subscale and several potential sociodemographic, physical and psychosocial prognostic indicators.LCGM identified three clusters. Cluster 1 \u2018good PF\u2019 contained 140 participants with good baseline PF and small improvements over time.

After backward selection, the final model that could best distinguish between improved participants (cluster 1) and deteriorated participants (cluster 2\u20133) included the following prognostic indicators: higher age, more depressive symptoms, less perceived self-efficacy and more activity avoidance.Older adults with joint pain and comorbidity either improved or deteriorated in PF over time. The prognostic model facilitates the classification of patients, the provision of more accurate information about prognosis and helps to narrow the focus to the high risk group of poor PF.",

The incidence or recurrence of disease in such patients could be up to 2.6%, with the main sites of recurrence being the vaginal vault or metastases in distant parts of the body. Genetic factors such as p53 overexpression, inactivation of 14-3-3-sigma, KRAS amplification and KRAS mRNA expression, microsatellite instability and Lynch syndrome genes could be associated with such a recurrence. Black race is also correlated, as well as lymphovascular space involvement, lower uterine segment involvement and DNA aneuploidy. Longer hysteroscopy duration was not found to be associated. Close follow-up is suggested for early detection of recurrences, while surgical excision of isolated disease or exenteration of local disease as well as radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the main treatment options.

When older women are treated as aggressively as their younger counterparts, survival is the same; however, especially where radiation or chemotherapy is used, toxicities may occur at the same or slightly higher rate.The more recent population based studies have larger sample sizes and minimize the biases seen in single center studies. They have also corrected for confounders giving a more accurate answer concerning the outcomes of older women treated for cervical cancer. Performance status (or \u201cfrailty\u201d) and not chronologic age should define the optimal treatment strategy for older women with cervical cancer.

     "abstract": "Uterine leiomyomas, commonly called fibroids, are the leading indication for hysterectomy in the United States. Incidence increases with age from menarche to perimenopause. Regardless of their generally benign neoplastic character, uterine fibroids are responsible for significant morbidity in a large proportion of women of reproductive age.As uterine leiomyomas generally regress after menopause, the general attitude when women are approaching perimenopausal age is to avoid treatment and wait for menopause and a spontaneous resolution. When it is decided that treatment is needed, the choice for peri- and postmenopausal women is often hysterectomy.In the present paper we point out aspects of leiomyoma management that are unique to the perimenopausal period, and address future directions in care.We conclude that the management of uterine leiomyomas should not be overlooked in the perimenopausal period merely on the grounds that the pathology and symptoms are unlikely to persist after the menopause; on the other hand, opting for a quick resolution with total surgical removal of the uterus, as seen at present in many cases, should be avoided.Studies on the impact of therapy for fibroids should be performed not exclusively with premenopausal women but also with perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, both users and non-users of hormone replacement therapy.",

     "abstract": "Immune senescence denotes the general decline in immune system function, characterized by a reduced immune response and an increased inflammatory state. Menopause is a natural change in a women's life, the menopause-related low estrogen levels affecting many body functions, among them the immune system. Numerous human studies with menopausal women and animal models with surgically induced menopause show a clear impact of sex steroids in immune responses. Female superiority in vaccination response and predisposition to infections are eliminated after menopause, while during menopause inflammatory cytokines such as Tumor Necrosis Factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), Interleukins-1\u03b2, 6, 8 and 13 (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-13) and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) are increased, implying a molecular connection of sex steroid loss with immune senescence. Moreover, immune cells modify their number and function after the menopausal transition, this offering another explanation for immune senescence. Until now most of the existing studies have concluded that menopause plays an additional role to aging in immune senescence. While it is clear that we are as yet far from thoroughly understanding the molecular pathways connecting sex steroids and menopause with immune senescence, such knowledge is highly likely to enable future targeted interventions in treatment and prevention of age-related diseases in women.",

The structure-modifying effects of these compounds have been reported and analyzed in recent meta-analyses. The results for knee OA demonstrate a small but significant reduction in the rate of joint space narrowing. Chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulphate are recommended by several guidelines from international societies for the management of knee and hip OA, while others do not recommend these products or recommend only under condition. This comprehensive review clarifies the role of these compounds in the therapeutic arsenal for patients with knee OA.",

     "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) represents a final and common pathway for all major traumatic insults to synovial joints. OA is the most common form of degenerative joint disease and a major cause of pain and disability. Despite the global increase in the incidence of OA, there are no effective pharmacotherapies capable of restoring the original structure and function of damaged articular cartilage. Consequently cell-based and biological therapies for osteoarthritis (OA) and related orthopaedic disorders have become thriving areas of research and development. Autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI) has been used for treatment of osteoarticular lesions for over two decades. Although chondrocyte-based therapy has the capacity to slow down the progression of OA and delay partial or total joint replacement surgery, currently used procedures are associated with the risk of serious adverse events. Complications of ACI include hypertrophy, disturbed fusion, delamination, and graft failure. Therefore there is significant interest in improving the success rate of ACI by improving surgical techniques and preserving the phenotype of the primary chondrocytes used in the procedure. Future tissue-engineering approaches for cartilage repair will also benefit from advances in chondrocyte-based repair strategies. This review article focuses on the structure and function of articular cartilage and the pathogenesis of OA in the context of the rising global burden of musculoskeletal disease. We explore the challenges associated with cartilage repair and regeneration using cell-based therapies that use chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). This paper also explores common misconceptions associated with cell-based therapy and highlights a few areas for future investigation.",

     "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies to molecular targets important for bone formation and bone resorption are being investigated for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Postmenopausal osteoporosis is characterized by increased bone turnover, with bone resorption typically exceeding bone formation. These pathophysiological changes cause decreased bone mineral density and disruption of bone microarchitecture which lead to low-trauma fractures.Sclerostin is a glycoprotein inhibitor of osteoblast Wnt signaling produced by osteocytes that has been recognized as a new target for therapeutic intervention in patients with osteoporosis. Sclerostin was first recognized when disorders with inactivating mutations of the sclerostin gene SOST were found to be associated with high bone mass. These observations suggested that inhibitors of sclerostin might be used to increase bone mineral density.Romosozumab (AMG 785) is the first humanized anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody that has been demonstrated to increase bone formation. This investigational monoclonal antibody, and blosozumab, another investigational anti-sclerostin antibody, have osteoanabolic properties with the potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients with osteoporosis. Similar to preclinical animal studies with sclerostin antibodies, initial clinical studies have shown that romosozumab increases bone formation and BMD. Further evaluation of the efficacy and safety of this agent in a large phase III controlled study is awaited. Phase I clinical trial data have recently been published with blosozumab. These novel interventions appear to be promising agents for the treatment of osteoporosis.",

Sixty women were treated for 12 weeks with isoflavone vaginal gel 4% (1\u00a0g/day) and a placebo gel. After 4 and 12 weeks, the vaginal atrophy symptoms were classified at none, mild, moderate and severe and the vaginal cytology were taken to determine the maturation value. Vaginal pH was measured at the beginning and end of therapy. Microbiopsies in vaginal fornix were performed before the treatment and after 12 weeks of treatment.Isoflavone vaginal gel was effective for relief of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia symptons and an increase in the intermediate and superficial cells was noted. The vaginal pH in the isoflavone group was 7.1 at baseline and 5.4 after 12 weeks, whereas in the placebo group there was no significant change. A significant increase in thickness after treatment was detected in the Isoflavone Group. The percentage of estrogen receptor positive cells in vaginal epithelium for the Isoflavone Group ranged from 58.5% at the beginning of treatment to 82.6% after 12 weeks. These results were superior to placebo gel.Glycine max (L.)

Non hormonal therapies such as antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine may be useful for those patients but there are few data about their safety.This retrospective study analyses the use by BC patients of treatments known to alleviate climacteric symptoms.Post-menopausal Estrogen Receptors positive (ER+) BC patients, aged 45\u201369, were identified as having bought, at least once, an aromatase inhibitor (AI) or tamoxifen between the years 2000 and 2012 through a pharmaceutical databank in Belgium. Among them, we defined users of a climacteric treatment those who bought, at least once, HRT, vaginal topical estrogens, antidepressants, clonidine and gabapentine.We identified 2530 BC patients. Among them, 45% were buying a treatment known to alleviate menopausal symptoms. The majority of these treatments were non-HRT therapies. HRT and vaginal estrogens were seldom bought (respectively 1.1% and 6%), but 3% bought vaginal estrogens while buying AI. About 9.2% of tamoxifen users patients bought antidepressants implicated in tamoxifen metabolism at the same time as tamoxifen.Most BC patients follow current guidelines contra-indicating the use of HRT after BC, they use non hormonal therapies.

Atherosclerosis is an aging-related disease, the pathogenesis of which involves chronic inflammation and increased oxidative stress. Since melatonin has both anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, it may be associated with atherosclerosis. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between urine concentrations of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (aMT6s) and arterial stiffness in post-menopausal women.A total of 66 post-menopausal women participated in the study. Melatonin secretion was estimated by measuring aMT6s levels in first morning urine samples. The cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) was used as an indicator of arterial stiffness.Estimated mean CAVI decreased gradually with increasing aMT6s quartiles. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the fourth aMT6s quartile was associated with a high CAVI with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.03 (95% confidence interval, 0.01\u20130.47).Our study revealed an inverse relationship between urine aMT6s and arterial stiffness as determined by CAVI. Although it is impossible to determine causality, our results suggest that melatonin may have a beneficial role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Additionally, women with a prevalent osteoporotic vertebral fracture have a high risk of experiencing a further one within one year. It is therefore important for the physician to use a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for early detection and effective treatment of vertebral fractures.The aim of this position statement is to provide and critically appraise evidence on the management of women with a vertebral osteoporotic fracture.Literature review and consensus of expert opinion.The management of women with osteoporotic vertebral fractures includes measures to reduce pain providing early mobility, to support the affected spine ensuring fracture healing, as well as starting treatment for osteoporosis itself. Any other underlying pathology should be sought and treated. Early detection and treatment is essential as there is an increased risk of further fractures in patients with vertebral fractures. Treatment will depend on the underlying causes of bone loss, efficacy in any particular situation, cost and patient preference.",

     "abstract": "Women's fertility potential is declining with age because of multiples intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as life style, oxidative stress and/or endocrine disruptors and is affecting the ability of these women to conceive naturally. This declining fertility potential and the late age of motherhood is increasing significantly the number of patients consulting infertility specialists. Different strategies of investigation and management are proposed to patients over 40 in order to overcome their infertility and improve the live birth rate in these patients.Intra Uterine Insemination (IUI) in women over 40 is associated with a low rate of ongoing pregnancy and IUI should not therefore be offered always as the first line of treatment. When the predictive factors are positive IVF/ICSI seem to be good alternatives until 43 years of age. Customized ovarian stimulation and flexible laboratory methods such as in vitro maturation (IVM), preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), embryo vitrification and transfer after thawing in subsequent natural or artificial cycles can improve the success rate of ART in patients over 40. Meanwhile, oocyte and embryos donation remain good options for patient over 40 with a bad prognosis and can lead to successful ongoing pregnancies until 45 years of age. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation, oocyte vitrification at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage or metaphase II stage present a breakthrough for fertility preservation but the ideal age for starting fertility preservation is still debated as well as the minimum number of oocytes to be vitrified in order to optimize the chances of pregnancy when needed at an older age.This manuscript reports the results of our own experience from patients older than 40 in the light of the published data and discusses the different therapeutic alternatives which can be proposed to patients over 40 consulting ART centres.",

     "abstract": "The recent trend toward delayed parenthood raises major safety concerns because of the adverse effects of aging on couple fertility. Studies have demonstrated that aging clearly affects female fertility, but can also affect male fertility. Although several theories have been proposed, the exact mechanisms responsible for the observed age-related decline in male fertility remain to be elucidated. It has been shown that advanced paternal age (PA) is associated with reduced semen volume as well as, reduced sperm count, motility and morphology. Recent studies have also reported that paternal aging is associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of both genomic and epigenomic sperm defects. In the context of natural and intrauterine insemination (IUI) conception, advanced paternal age has been associated with lower pregnancy rates and increased rates of spontaneous abortion (independent of maternal age). In IVF and oocyte donation programs, a significant decrease in late blastocyst development has been seen in those cycles using spermatozoa of men older than 55. However, no significant relationship between paternal age and IVF or ICSI pregnancy rates has been observed.Although there are no treatments that can fully restore the age-related decline in male fertility, various measures have been shown to optimize male fertility potential. Specific therapies (e.g. varicocelectomy) and lifestyle changes (e.g. dietary antioxidant supplements) may help minimize some of the age-related deleterious effects on spermatogenesis, such as, oxidative stress and endocrine abnormalities.",

Three studies were eligible for fixed-effects meta-analysis of bias-corrected effect size of the difference in lateral ventricle volume between cases with vitamin D depletion and controls.

The pooled effect size was 1.01 [95% CI: 0.62; 1.41], a \u2018large\u2019 effect size indicating that the ventricle volume was 1.01 SD higher with vitamin D depletion. Results on brain subvolumes were mixed, and indicated that brain atrophy with vitamin D depletion could be explained not by temporal lobe atrophy but rather by loss of matter at the cranial vertex, possibly in the precuneus cortex. In conclusion, despite increasing evidence arguing for an action of vitamin D in the brain, data is sparse regarding brain morphological changes related to vitamin D depletion. The retrieved association between vitamin D depletion and brain atrophy provides a scientific base for vitamin D replacement trials.",

     "abstract": "The role of vitamin D in bone health has been known for over a century. More recent research has suggested that vitamin D may play a role in the muscular, immune, endocrine, and central nervous systems. Animal research suggests that vitamin D may have some protective effects against toxic insults that are known to damage dopamine cells, the primary cells to degenerate in PD. Persons with PD tend to have lower vitamin D levels than persons of similar ages without PD. Vitamin D levels are generally associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in persons with PD, but simply giving vitamin D does not appear to improve BMD. Results of genetic studies examining polymorphism of the vitamin D receptor and PD risk, severity, or age at onset have shown variable results, with FokI CC seeming to possibly carry some increased risk of PD. Amount of sun exposure and vitamin D levels in earlier life may influence the risk of developing PD. Cross-sectional research suggests a relationship between vitamin D levels and severity of PD symptoms. A single intervention study did show some improvement in PD with vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D may have effects on PD symptoms and perhaps even on the risk of disease development or disease progression. More well designed intervention studies are needed to confirm the effect of vitamin D on PD symptoms. Human neuroprotection studies are needed, but probably not feasible until better biomarkers are established.",

The treatment effect was significantly greater in women not receiving chemotherapy, those with higher levels of psychological distress at baseline and for non-white women. Beliefs about control/coping with hot flushes were the main mediators of improvement in problem rating following CBT. Beliefs about hot flushes in a social context, depressed mood and sleep problems were also identified as mediators.These findings suggest that CBT is widely applicable for breast cancer patients who are experiencing treatment related menopausal symptoms, and that CBT works mainly by changing beliefs and improving mood and sleep.",

Hearing impairment has been shown to precede cognitive decline, but it is not clear if the hearing loss is an early marker of dementia or a modifiable risk factor. Olfactory impairment is seen in many neurodegenerative conditions, but it has been shown that those with dementia have particular difficulties with the recognition and identification of odours rather than the detection, suggesting a link to impairment of higher cognitive function. Olfactory impairment has been shown to be predictive of conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease with 85.2% sensitivity.As cognitive function deteriorates, the world is experienced at a sensory level, with reduced ability to integrate the sensory experiences to understand the context. Thus, people with dementia are very sensitive to sensory experiences and their environment needs to be managed carefully to make it understandable, comfortable, and (if possible) therapeutic. Light can be used to stabilise the circadian rhythm, which may be disturbed in dementia. Music therapy, aromatherapy, massage and multisensory stimulation are recommended by NICE for the management of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), although the mechanisms behind such interventions are poorly understood and evidence is limited. Sensory considerations are likely to play a greater role in dementia care in the future, with the development of purpose-built dementia care facilities and the focus on non-pharmacological management strategies for BPSD.",

The disease may be uni- or bilateral, and may migrate to distinct joints. One main feature of TRO is spontaneous recovery. Pain and progressive limitation in the functionality of the affected joint(s) are key symptoms. In the case of the form associated with pregnancy, difficulties in diagnosis derive from the relatively young age at presentation and from the clinical overlapping with the frequent aches during gestation. Densitometric osteoporosis in the affected region is not always present, but bone marrow edema, with or without joint effusion, is detected by magnetic resonance. There are not treatment guidelines, but the association of antiresorptives to symptomatic treatment seems to be beneficial.

A 62.2% of women were rural residents, 21.2% were postmenopausal, 20.1% were receiving psychotropic drugs, 64.2% had abdominal obesity (waist\u00a0\u2265\u00a088\u00a0cm), and 9.7% reported intimate violence. A 12.8% had an abnormal GHQ-12 score (total score\u00a0\u2265\u00a03) whereas 14.2% had severe menopause-related symptoms (total MRS score\u00a0\u2265\u00a017). The prevalence of disturbed sleep (JSS score\u00a0\u2265\u00a012) was 37.5%. JSS scores displayed significant differences in relation to menopausal status, presence of stress urinary incontinence, use of psychiatric treatment, intimate partner violence, self-perception of healthiness, and partner factors (perception of healthiness, educational level, and regular exercise). Higher JSS scores (disturbed sleep) positively correlated with GHQ-12 and MRS scores, number of co-morbid conditions, body mass index, and female and partner age. Multiple linear regression analysis found that JSS scores correlated positively with somatic MRS scores and with intimate violence, and inversely with partner educational level (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.375, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).In this mid-aged female sample, disturbed sleep was related to somatic menopause-related symptoms, intimate violence and partner educational level.",

     "abstract": "Urinary incontinence (UI) threatens women's physical and mental health, but few women seek healthcare for their incontinence. Evidence is substantial that stigma may be associated with health service utilization for such diseases as mental illness, but sparse for UI. We examine the relationship between disease stigma and intentions to seek care for UI.A cross-sectional community-based study was used. A purposive sample of 305 women aged 40\u201365 years in a Chinese city who had stress urinary incontinence (SUI) was enrolled from May to October in 2011.Data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics, UI symptoms, disease stigma and intentions to seek care.Social rejection was positively linearly related to intentions to seek care for UI (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.207; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.152, 0.784), indicating that more social rejection predicted stronger intentions to seek care. Significant curvilinear association between internalized shame and intentions to seek care was observed (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.169; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.433, \u22120.047). Compared to women with the low and high levels of internalized shame, those with the moderate level of internalized shame reported stronger intentions to seek care.The impact of stigma on intentions to seek care varies by aspects and levels of stigma. Social rejection enhances intentions to seek care while internalized shame influences intentions to seek care in a quadratic way. The crucial step of targeted interventions will be to disentangle subgroups of SUI women with different aspects and levels of stigma.",

Using the MRS questionnaire climacteric symptoms were assessed in 395 \u201cHispanic-Mestizas\u201d (Quechua-Spaniard breeding) and 376 pure \u201cQuechuas\u201d.The \u201cQuechuas\u201d compared with \u201cHispanic-Mestizas\u201d have comparable similar age, but less: obesity, schooling years, cigarette smoking, use of hormonal therapy, diabetes and hypertension; and a greater: proportion of postmenopausal women and number of children. \u201cQuechuas\u201d showed a greater prevalence in ten of the eleven symptoms evaluated by the MRS scale, except for insomnia.

In general, women with the METS displayed a trend for higher levels of the analyzed markers. Nevertheless, only IL-6 levels were found to be significantly higher and uPA levels significantly lower among METS women as compared to those without the syndrome. When analyte levels were compared as to presenting or not each of the diagnostic features of the METS, it was found that IL-6 levels were higher among women with abdominal obesity, low HDL-C and high triglyceride levels. Women with low HDL-C and high triglyceride levels presented significantly lower uPA levels and those with high glucose and low HDL-C displayed significantly higher sCD40L levels.Postmenopausal women with the METS in this sample displayed higher IL-6 (inflammation) and lower uPA levels (endothelial dysfunction).

Trials of estrogen therapy have produced inconclusive results, however, partly because of flaws in study design and partly because of the complexity of the mechanisms underlying estrogen's effects on joint tissues. Initial studies of the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have reported beneficial effects in OA. These agents may exert both a direct effect upon joint cartilage and indirect effects on subchondral bone, synovium, muscle, tendons and ligaments. SERMs may be particularly beneficial for postmenopausal patients with osteoporotic OA, a phenotype defined by decreased bone density, associated with high remodeling in subchondral bone. More research is needed, though, before SERMs can become a therapeutic option for OA.",

However epidemiological available data are not consistent for many foods and the associations with cancer risk remain unclear. The concerns about this issue are considered like a \u201cHot topic\u201d for oncologists and general population.The aim of this report is to present a review of the published epidemiologic research to date reflecting the most current scientific evidence related to diet and cancer risk.EMBASE and PubMed-NCBI were searched for relevant articles up to October 2013 that identified potentials interactions between foods or dietary patterns with cancer risk.There is no conclusive evidence as an independent risk factor for isolated nutrients versus adoption of dietary patterns for cancer risk. Moderate physical activity after breast cancer diagnosis contributes to 40% reduction of recurrence/disease-specific mortality. Cancer colon risk derived from meat intake is influenced by both total intake and its frequency. The interaction of phenolic compounds on metabolic and signaling pathways like P450, MAP kinase, PI3 kinase, IGF-1, NF-kB and ROS seems to exert an inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and tumor metastasis and induces apoptosis in various types of cancer cells, including colon, lung, prostate, hepatocellular or breast cancer.There is a direct relationship between unhealthy diet and lifestyle with the increase of tumor development and cancer risk. For this reason, a good nutritional status based on a balanced diet constitutes one of the main preventive factors from tumors. However the mixed results from epidemiologic studies hinder to get unequivocal and consistent evidence about the interaction between diet and cancer risk. More epidemiological studies will be needed in the future to clarify this issue.",

     "abstract": "Neuroprotective effects of phytoestrogen compounds (found in soy) have been demonstrated in animal research and cell culture studies. In particular, phytoestrogens have been shown to reduce Alzheimer's Disease (AD) related pathology, potentially alleviating risk of AD progression. In addition to their antioxidant properties, soy products also have the ability to affect cognition via interaction with estrogen receptors. However, observational studies and randomised controlled trials in humans have resulted in inconclusive findings within this domain. There are several possible reasons for these discrepant data. Studies which report no effect of phytoestrogens on cognition have mainly been carried out in European cohorts, with an average low dietary consumption. In contrast, investigation of Asian populations, with a higher general intake of tofu (a non-fermented soy product) have shown negative associations with cognitive function in those over the age of 65. Consideration of type of soy product is important, as in the latter sample, protective effects of tempe (fermented soy) were also observed. Limited data provide evidence that effects of phytoestrogens on cognition may be modified by dosage, duration of consumption and cognitive test used. Additionally, characteristics of the study population including age, gender, ethnicity and menopausal status appear to be mediating variables. Phytoestrogen treatment interventions have also shown time-limited positive effects on cognition. These findings are consistent with estrogen treatment studies, where initial positive short-term cognitive effects may occur, which reverse with long-term continuous use in elderly women. Well controlled, large scale studies are needed to assess the effects of phytoestrogens on the aging brain and provide further understanding of this association.",

MetS constitutes a cluster of risk factors for an increased mortality, including obesity, impaired glucose homeostasis, hypertension and atherogenic dyslipidemia. Individuals with MetS are also often in a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state. The objective of this review is to examine recent meta-analyses and clinical studies on the association between dairy products consumption and these MetS risk factors. Findings from studies demonstrate that weight loss related to dairy product intake is due to the combination of an energy-restricted diet with consumption of dairy products. Further, a limited number of studies have shown beneficial effects of dairy consumption on plasma lipids, blood pressure, glucose homeostasis or inflammatory and oxidative stress profiles. Overall, this review article suggests that adults should consume at least 2\u20133 servings of dairy products per day within a well-balanced diet and a healthy lifestyle for metabolic health. Yet, higher dairy product consumption may have additional beneficial effects, but more well-designed intervention studies are needed to ascertain these effects.",

For the treatment of over-active bladder and urgency UI, intra-vesical injections of botulinum toxin A, utilising a flexible or rigid cystoscope has become an established treatment. An alternative to the use of onaBoNTA is sacral nerve stimulation (SNS).Vaginal tapes/slings procedures have become treatment of choice for stress UI.

Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) we studied the central serotonin transporter (SERT) in vivo using [123I]-beta-carbomethoxy-3-\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (beta-CIT) and, as previous studies have shown that reactivity of the skin blood vessels is enhanced in those who flush, we examined cutaneous microvascular perfusion.Cutaneous microvascular perfusion was assessed in 31 postmenopausal women, with flushing, using laser Doppler imaging with iontophoresis (LDI\u00a0+\u00a0ION), before and after 8 weeks of treatment with venlafaxine. A sub-group of 14 of these women also had SPECT imaging at both time points to evaluate the availability of SERT in the brain. Flush frequency and score was recorded, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) II scores were assessed before and after treatment.Following treatment with venlafaxine, there was a significant reduction in the [123I]-beta-CIT binding ratio, BDI scores, flushing and endothelial dependent perfusion response. [123I]-Beta-CIT reduction was associated with BDI reduction (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.54; F\u00a0=\u00a08.8; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004), but not flushing reduction or perfusion reduction.Venlafaxine resulted in a decrease in BDI II scores with an associated reduction in [123I]-beta-CIT binding in a group of non-depressed women. It also improved flush frequency and severity which may be as a result of decreases seen in enhanced cutaneous microvascular perfusion.",

The 52-week open-label extension period plus initial 12-week treatment period totaled up to 64 weeks of ospemifene exposure. A 4-week posttreatment follow-up ensued (68 weeks total).Safety assessments included adverse events, laboratory studies, physical and gynecologic examination, vital signs, breast palpation, and mammography.Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) during the extension study were mild or moderate in severity. The most common TEAE related to study drug was hot flushes (10%; leading to discontinuation for 2% of patients). One serious TEAE, a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in a patient with pre-existing cardiac disease, was considered possibly related to study medication. One mild breast-related TEAE, considered unrelated to study drug, was ongoing at study completion. There were no instances of pelvic organ prolapse, incontinence, venous thromboembolism, fractures, breast cancers or death. No clinically significant adverse changes were observed in other safety parameters.Ospemifene is clinically safe and generally well tolerated in postmenopausal patients with dyspareunia, a symptom of VVA.",

Data regarding risk factors related to osteoporosis were obtained, and, among other biochemical measures, 25 hydroxyvitamin D and parathyroid hormone were determined. Bone densitometry was carried out in the lumbar spine and proximal femur, as well as lateral X-rays of the dorsal and lumbar spine.The women who lived in rural areas were older, shorter, heavier and had a higher body mass index than those from urban areas. Among the women from rural areas there was a higher prevalence of poverty, and higher levels of obesity, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus were observed, as well as a higher prevalence of densitometric osteoporosis. The rural women had lower values of bone mineral density in the lumbar spine and a higher prevalence of vertebral fractures and hypovitaminosis D. The variables which were associated independently with living in rural areas were poverty, obesity, vertebral fractures, BMD in the lumbar spine and levels of 25 hydroxyvitamin D.In our study, postmenopausal women who live in rural populations have more poverty, lower values of vitamin D, lower BMD in the lumbar spine and a higher prevalence of vertebral fractures and of osteoporosis. The higher prevalence of obesity, arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus observed in these women may be adjuvant factors, all fostered by their socioeconomic state of poverty.",

There is no study showing any improvement in bone-alkaline-phosphatase (BAP), n-telopeptide of type-1 collagen (NTX), 25-hydroxy-vitamin D, and urinary markers. Improvement in BMD could not be shown in the majority of the studies; there is no interventional study evaluating the fracture risk.Studies evaluating the isolated effects of menatetrenone (MK-4) showed significant improvement in osteocalcin (OC); however, there are inconsistent results on BAP, NTX, and urinary markers. BMD was found to be significantly increased in the majority of studies. The fracture risk was assessed in three studies, which showed decreased fracture risk to some extent. Although there are proven beneficial effects on some of the bone formation markers, there is not enough evidence-based data to support a role for vitamin K supplementation in osteoporosis prevention among healthy, postmenopausal women receiving vitamin D and calcium supplementation.Interventional studies investigating the isolated role of vitamin K on cardiovascular health are required. Longterm clinical trials are required to evaluate the effect of vitamin K on gynecological cancers. MK-4 seems safe even at doses as high as 45\u00a0mg/day.",

     "abstract": "Women's care during perimenopause and postmenopause is taking new paths to help women cope with both somatic manifestations and changes related to psychological and social factors. An updated, systematic review was conducted on non-pharmacological psychosocial interventions with regard to peri- and postmenopause. Several databases complemented with reference lists and reviews were used to perform a literature search of any relevant article. Studies were selected if they included psychoeducational programmes, health education and promotion and cognitive-behavioural techniques applied to peri- or postmenopausal women, independently of study design, main outcomes and intervention comparators. A total of 33 reports and 3 relevant reviews published between 1987 and 2013 were included. Psychosocial options are promising intervention options for self-management and self-care, as they provide multiple benefits with no side effects. Moreover, these options are recommended for women in clinical, subclinical and asymptomatic groups, as they offer women the agency and skills necessary to manage and relieve menopausal symptoms, as well as provide information and alternatives to prevent menopausal symptoms and to have a more positive experience during these life stages. These options do more than reduce distress and complaints, as they allow women in any condition to enjoy enhanced health, well-being and quality of life. Moreover, these options are accompanied by important cost reductions in pharmaceutical investment and healthcare. Nevertheless, several issues remain controversial or have scarcely been investigated, and additional high-quality research should address these issues properly in the future. Despite these limitations and the weaknesses of the review, the findings of this review are interesting and positive. Thus, we encourage women-focused institutions and policies (e.g., healthcare centres, public organisations and women's associations) to offer psychosocial interventions to peri- and postmenopausal women within a comprehensive healthcare paradigm.",

One was the search for a more rational treatment, based on specific mechanisms, the other the development of effective treatments with fewer side effects, particularly for older patients, who have a greater sensitivity to cardio-vascular and central nervous system effects. The first has been frustrated up to a point, in that SSRIs and other single mechanism drugs do not appear to be more effective than the earliest relatively non-specific antidepressants. The second has been fulfilled, in that SSRIs generally are better tolerated in older patients and in overdose. However, there is a spectrum of other side effects that are particularly relevant in older age and that need attention when treating depression in this particular patient group.",

     "abstract": "The emergence of advanced genetic technologies raises many challenges for dementia care and the conduct of related social, behavioural and clinical research. Genetic tests are already used to identify possible participants in dementia prevention trials. These tests are unlike any other in clinical medicine as they have the capacity to predict disease onset after intervals of many years with implications for other family members. Genetic counselling professionals support services in paediatrics, cancer diagnosis and some adult-onset diseases. Their capacity cannot meet the needs for pre- and post-test support of the many \u201cat-risk\u201d families living with late onset dementia. Most dementias are common, complex conditions in which multiple genetic and environmental factors play important and potentially modifiable roles. Large scale prevention studies are needed to test the effectiveness of interventions. Some economy of effort will be achieved by the preferential inclusion of \u201cat-risk\u201d families. Many such families are in contact with dementia care services and will be motivated to participate in prevention studies. However, practice standards and consensus-based guidelines do not yet exist. Support services are not available on a scale sufficient to prevent harm when risk is poorly communicated causing unnecessary psychological morbidity in unaffected family members. There is a pressing need for research to inform the development of study guidelines and to identify how services are strengthened to support these families during and after their participation in trials. Discourse analysis provides a useful method to collect and analyse data of this type and supports the conclusions of this review.",

Despite some limited progress in its treatment over the last decade, currently there are few therapeutic options and overall survival remains poor. Increasing knowledge about the molecular biology of ovarian cancer has led to the development of targeted therapies which promise to be more effective and to provide the basis for personalized treatment. The most successful strategies so far are employing anti-angiogenics (VEGF antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and angiopoietin antagonists) and polyadenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Other approaches target aberrant OC signalling such as the PI3K/Akt/mTOR network, the epidermal growth factor receptor, the WEE1 tyrosine kinase and the folate receptor alpha. Immunotherapy is another promising new approach against ovarian cancer. In this area, immunotherapeutic modulation by administering autologous immune cells, such as dendritic cells (DCs), to stimulate antitumour host responses is of special interest. Finally, there is now growing evidence from clinical studies showing a survival advantage for intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy when compared to conventional intravenous treatment in the adjuvant setting. New strategies such as pressurized IP aerosol chemotherapy might further improve the efficacy of this approach.",

In POPPS trial 1, women with mild POP receive either PFMT or watchful waiting. In POPPS trial 2, women with advanced POP receive either PFMT or pessary treatment. Patient recruitment started in 2009 and was finished in December 2012. Primary outcome of both POPPS trials is improvement in POP-related symptoms. Secondary outcomes are quality of life, sexual function, POP-Q stage, pelvic floor muscle function, post-void residual volume, patients\u2019 perception of improvement, and costs. All outcomes are measured 3, 12, and 24 months after the start of treatment. Cost-effectiveness will be calculated based on societal costs, using the PFDI-20 and the EQ-5D as outcomes. In this paper the POPPS design, the encountered challenges and our solutions, and participant baseline characteristics are presented. For both trials the target numbers of patients in each treatment group are achieved, giving this study sufficient power to lead to promising results.",

     "abstract": "There are two commonly used fracture risk prediction tools FRAX\u00ae and Garvan Fracture Risk Calculator (GARVAN-FRC). The objective of this study was to investigate the utility of these tools in daily practice.A prospective population-based 5-year follow-up study was conducted in ten general practice centres in the Netherlands. For the analyses, the FRAX\u00ae and GARVAN-FRC 10-year absolute risks (FRAX\u00ae does not have 5-year risk prediction) for all fractures were used.Among 506 postmenopausal women aged \u226560 years (mean age: 67.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8 years), 48 (9.5%) sustained a fracture during follow-up. Both tools, using BMD values, distinguish between women who did and did not fracture (10.2% vs. 6.8%, respectively for FRAX\u00ae and 32.4% vs. 39.1%, respectively for GARVAN-FRC, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) at group level. However, only 8.9% of those who sustained a fracture had an estimated fracture risk \u226520% using FRAX\u00ae compared with 53.3% using GARVAN-FRC. Although both underestimated the observed fracture risk, the GARVAN-FRC performed significantly better for women who sustained a fracture (higher sensitivity) and FRAX\u00ae for women who did not sustain a fracture (higher specificity). Similar results were obtained using age related cut off points.The discriminant value of both models is at least as good as models used in other medical conditions; hence they can be used to communicate the fracture risk to patients. However, given differences in the estimated risks between FRAX\u00ae and GARVAN-FRC, the significance of the absolute risk must be related to country-specific recommended intervention thresholds to inform the patient.",

Suspected factors responsible for the global increase include lifestyle changes, notably diet. Currently accepted risk factors directly linked to diet are greater body weight and alcohol consumption.

Numerous studies also show an impact of specific diets and nutrients \u2013 fatty acids, carbohydrates, vitamins B, D, carotenoids, phytoestrogens, fiber \u2013 on breast cancer risk, and evidence supports a mechanistic basis for an influence of specific nutrients. However, these studies are plagued with conflicting results.

     "abstract": "The bothersome vasomotor and vaginal symptoms and bone loss that accompany the menopausal transition are associated with significant direct costs due to physician visits and medication, as well as indirect costs from reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and work productivity. With life expectancies increasing, the number of postmenopausal women is also increasing, and more women are remaining in the workforce. These factors have led to an increased burden of menopausal symptoms on healthcare systems. Hormone therapy (HT) has been shown to effectively reduce menopausal symptoms and significantly increase quality-adjusted life years in postmenopausal women, particularly in women experiencing severe symptoms. However, many women discontinue use of HT before their symptoms have dissipated due to safety and tolerability concerns. The tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC) that pairs bazedoxifene (BZA) with conjugated estrogens (CE) has been developed to provide relief of menopausal symptoms and prevent bone loss without stimulating the breast or endometrium, and to have improved tolerability compared with HT. In this context, BZA 20\u00a0mg/CE 0.45 and 0.625\u00a0mg were shown to prevent bone loss and effectively treat menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women with an intact uterus, while also demonstrating a favorable safety/tolerability profile. BZA 20\u00a0mg/CE 0.45 and 0.625\u00a0mg were further associated with clinically significant improvements in HRQoL, sleep, and treatment satisfaction. Taken together, the reduction in menopausal symptoms, improvement in HRQoL, and favorable safety/tolerability profile associated with BZA/CE suggest that it is a cost-effective alternative to HT for managing the burden of menopausal symptoms.",

     "abstract": "Clinical data suggest an impact of estrogen on the pathogenesis of urinary tract infections (UTI). In particular, women after menopause often suffer from recurrent UTI, characterized by at least three acute UTI episodes within a year. Aside from bacterial factors promoting persistence within the urinary bladder, the low estrogen levels induce structural and chemical changes in the urogenital tract which facilitate UTI. Increased residual urine volume and changes in the vaginal microflora are well documented risk factors. Local supplementation with estrogen can at least partly reverse these changes. Treatment allows the re-establishment of a lactobacilli-dominated vaginal microflora and improves epithelial differentiation and integrity in the urogenital tract. This estrogenic effect on the epithelium is marked by an increased production of antimicrobial peptides and a tighter intercellular connection, preventing bacteria from reaching cells where they can hide and later emerge and cause a new infection. Estrogen in the dosages and applications used to date is considered safe for the endometrium in the majority of women. Based on the actions and safety of estrogen, local supplementation thus offers a treatment option for postmenopausal women suffering from recurrent UTI.",

Covariables were sociodemographic, anthropometric, functional, cognitive, affective and of comorbidity. Hospitalization, emergency visits and falls in the 6 previous months was recorded. Differences between non-frail and prefrail as one group and frail participants were analyzed using \u03c72 tests, t-Student and logistic regression.Mean age 84.1 (SD 6.7), with 209 (65.1%) women. 68.8% were frail, 28.4% pre-frail, 2.8% non-frail, and in 2.2% three criteria were not available to determine frailty status. Women were more frequently frail than men (77.1% vs. 22.9%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and frail participants were older (85.1 vs. 82.3; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) than non-frail ones.

     "abstract": "The focus of nutrition is often on healthy diets and exercise to minimise the risk of developing lifestyle diseases such as cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, during the shift into older years often the nutrition priorities change towards meeting increased nutrient needs with less energy requirements, and minimising lean muscle loss. There are several causes of general malnutrition in the elderly that lead to depletion of muscle including starvation (protein-energy malnutrition), sarcopenia and cachexia. The prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition increases with age and the number of comorbidities. A range of simple and validated screening tools can be used to identify malnutrition in older adults, e.g. MST, MNA-SF and \u2018MUST\u2019. Older adults should be screened for nutritional issues at diagnosis, on admission to hospitals or care homes and during follow up at outpatient or General Practitioner clinics, at regular intervals depending on clinical status. Early identification and treatment of nutrition problems can lead to improved outcomes and better quality of life.",

     "abstract": "Longevity is a very complex phenomenon, because many environmental, behavioral, socio-demographic and dietary factors influence the physiological pathways of aging and life-expectancy. Nutrition has been recognized to have an important impact on overall mortality and morbidity; and its role in extending life expectancy has been the object of extensive scientific research. This paper reviews the pathophysiological mechanisms that potentially link aging with diet and the scientific evidence supporting the anti-aging effect of the traditional Mediterranean diet, as well as of some specific foods. The diet and several of its components have additionally been shown to have beneficial effects on the co-morbidities typical of elderly populations. Furthermore, the epigenetic effects of diet on the aging process \u2013 through calorie restriction and the consumption of foods like red wine, orange juice, probiotics and prebiotics \u2013 have attracted scientific interest. Some, such as dark chocolate, red wine, nuts, beans, avocados are being promoted as anti-aging foods, due to their anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Finally, an important moderator in the relationship between diet, longevity and human health remains the socio-economic status of individual, as a healthy diet, due to its higher cost, is closely related to higher financial and educational status.",

     "abstract": "Targeted therapy or molecular targeted therapy has been defined as a type of treatment that blocks the growth of cancer cells by interfering with specific cell molecules required for carcinogenesis and tumor growth, rather than by simply interfering with all rapidly dividing cells as with traditional chemotherapy. There is a growing number of FDA approved monoclonal antibodies and small molecules targeting specific types of cancer suggestive of the growing relevance of this therapeutic approach. Targeted cancer therapies, also referred to as \u201cPersonalized Medicine\u201d, are being studied for use alone, in combination with other targeted therapies, and in combination with chemotherapy. The objective of personalized medicine is the identification of patients that would benefit from a specific treatment based on the expression of molecular markers. Examples of this approach include bevacizumab and olaparib, which have been designated as promising targeted therapies for ovarian cancer. Combinations of trastuzumab with pertuzumab, or T-DM1 and mTOR inhibitors added to an aromatase inhibitor are new therapeutic strategies for breast cancer. Although this approach has been seen as a major step in the expansion of personalized medicine, it has substantial limitations including its high cost and the presence of serious adverse effects. The Cancer Genome Atlas is a useful resource to identify novel and more effective targets, which may help to overcome the present limitations. In this review we will discuss the clinical outcome of some of these new therapies with a focus on ovarian and breast cancer. We will also discuss novel concepts in targeted therapy, the target of cancer stem cells.",

However, unlike estrogen and progestins, there is a paucity of data regarding the incidence of breast cancer in women treated with testosterone therapy. This study was designed to investigate the incidence of breast cancer in women treated with subcutaneous testosterone therapy in the absence of systemic estrogen therapy.This is a 5-year interim analysis of a 10-year, prospective, observational, IRB approved study investigating the incidence of breast cancer in women presenting with symptoms of hormone deficiency treated with subcutaneous testosterone (T) implants or, T combined with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (A), i.e., T\u00a0+\u00a0A implants. Breast cancer incidence was compared with that of historical controls reported in the literature, age specific Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) incidence rates, and a representative, similar age group of our patients used as a \u2018control\u2019 group. The effect of adherence to T therapy was also evaluated.Since March 2008, 1268 pre and post menopausal women have been enrolled in the study and eligible for analysis. As of March 2013, there have been 8 cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in 5642 person-years of follow up for an incidence of 142 cases per 100\u00a0000 person-years, substantially less than the age-specific SEER incidence rates (293/100\u00a0000), placebo arm of Women's Health Initiative Study (300/100\u00a0000), never users of hormone therapy from the Million Women Study (325/100\u00a0000) and our control group (390/100\u00a0000). Unlike adherence to estrogen therapy, adherence to T therapy further decreased the incidence of breast cancer (73/100\u00a0000).T and/or T\u00a0+\u00a0A, delivered subcutaneously as a pellet implant, reduced the incidence of breast cancer in pre and postmenopausal women. Evidence supports that breast cancer is preventable by maintaining a T to estrogen ratio in favor of T and, in particular, by the use of continuous T or, when indicated, T\u00a0+\u00a0A. This hormone therapy should be further investigated for the prevention and treatment of breast cancer.",

Consequently many women are seeking alternatives and exercise might be one such option but there is a lack of high quality evidence on its effectiveness.This RCT initially aims to investigate the feasibility/acceptability of two exercise interventions identified from our previous preference study in 165 women, and if found to be feasible/acceptable, continue to recruit sufficient women (n\u00a0=\u00a0261) to examine the effect of these interventions on hot flushes/night sweats and other outcomes relevant to menopausal women.We aim to recruit inactive perimenopausal and menopausal symptomatic women not using HT and randomise them to one of two exercise interventions or usual care for six months.We will assess outcomes at baseline and 6 and 12 months from randomisation.We hope this RCT will contribute towards increasing the evidence regarding the question of whether exercise is an effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms in women not taking HT.",

Patients were older than 60 years, used antidepressants, and had a complete geriatric assessment.Serum sodium and antidiuretic hormone levels, serum osmolality, urine sodium level, and urine osmolality were measured. The prevalence of hyponatremia (serum sodium <135\u00a0mM) as an adverse reaction to an antidepressant (AR-AD), defined with Naranjo's algorithm, was calculated. Hyponatremic patients were compared to normonatremic patients with regard to gender, age, weight, history of hyponatremia, hyponatremia-associated medications and disorders, and type and duration of antidepressant use.Of 358 eligible patients, 345 were included. The prevalence of hyponatremia as an AR-AD was 9.3%.

All the women were referred to undergo a radiological spine examination, spinal densitometry and a panoramic radiograph for assessing osteoporosis using 3 radiomorphometric indexes: Panoramic Mandibular Index (PMI), Mental Index (MI) and Mandibular Cortical Index (MCI). According to mandibular cortical shape, in MCI, three groups were defined: C3 (osteoporosis), C2 (osteopenia), C1 (health).Significant differences were found between all the MCI groups due to their composition between fractures and non-fractures. C1 group (healthy) has less fractures women than C2 (Bonferroni p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), C1 has less fractures than C3 (Bonferroni p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and finally, C2 has less fractures than C3 (Bonferroni p\u00a0<\u00a00.006).

Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to measure the effect of a range of socio-demographic characteristics, modifiable lifestyle factors, and health markers (self-reported physical health, history of chronic illness) on the latent construct of mental health status. Mental health was evaluated using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 12 (SF-12\u00ae) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).The model was a good fit for the data (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a04.582, df\u00a0=\u00a03, p\u00a0=\u00a00.205) suggesting that mental health is negatively correlated with sleep disturbance (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.612, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and a history of depression (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.141, p\u00a0=\u00a00.024).While mental health was associated with poor sleep, it was not correlated with most lifestyle factors (BMI, alcohol consumption, or cigarette smoking) or socio-demographics like age, income or employment category and they were removed from the final model.Research suggests that it is important to engage in a range of health promoting behaviors to preserve good health. We found that predictors of current mental health status included sleep disturbance, and past mental health problems, while socio-demographics and modifiable lifestyle had little impact. It may be however, that these factors influenced other variables associated with the mental health of post-menopausal women, and these relationships warrant further investigation.",

     "abstract": "Although hormone therapy using estrogens plus progestogens (EPT) is effective for the management of menopausal symptoms (e.g., vasomotor symptoms and vulvar/vaginal atrophy) and prevention/treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis, EPT is associated with safety and tolerability concerns. A new alternative to EPT is the tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC), which partners a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with one or more estrogens and is designed to treat menopausal symptoms and prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis without the tolerability concerns associated with EPT. The first TSEC to reach advanced clinical development is a combination of the SERM bazedoxifene (BZA) with conjugated estrogens (CE). BZA has been shown to inhibit the stimulatory activity of CE on uterine tissue and breast in vitro and in vivo. In clinical studies, BZA/CE treatment has been associated with significant improvements in menopausal symptoms including hot flushes and vulvar/vaginal atrophy and significant increases in bone mineral density, coupled with reductions in bone turnover marker levels and improvements in sleep and health-related quality of life. Additionally, BZA/CE has been shown to have a neutral effect on endometrial and breast tissue because BZA inhibits the stimulatory effects of estrogens in tissue-selective fashion in these 2 organs. Taken together, results of these preclinical and clinical studies indicate that the benefits of estrogens for treating menopausal symptoms are maintained with BZA/CE without endometrial or breast stimulation, resulting in a safe and effective treatment for symptomatic postmenopausal women.",

Pelvic floor dysfunction globally affects micturition, defecation and sexual activity. Evolutionary modifications such ad adaptation to upright standing, walking and the need to deliver fetuses with larger head diameters made the fascial and muscle support of the pelvic floor vulnerable, therefore predisposing women to pelvic organ prolapse and incontinence. Different than in males, the female pelvic floor undergoes a number of adaptive changes related to life and endocrine events. Most of the clinical manifestations of these changes become apparent after menopause and throughout aging in women. This review article summarizes the key aspects of the pathophysiology and the clinics of the modifications of the pelvic floor in women through midlife and beyond.

Therefore all premenopausal women should receive counselling that includes discussion of sexual habits and contraception during routine health care encounters. The majority of US women in this age group use permanent contraception, but other methods can be safe and effective and can have non-contraceptive benefits.No contraceptive method is contraindicated based on age alone. However, estrogen-containing methods should be reserved for women without cardiovascular or thrombotic risk factors. The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS, Mirena\u00ae) has particular benefits during perimenopause and is safe for use in nearly all women. The LNG-IUS is approved for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding, a common concern during the perimenopause. A substantial literature supports the use of the LNG-IUS for endometrial protection during transition from contraception to hormone therapy, although this is off-label in the United States.Reliable contraception should be used until menopause is confirmed either by cessation of menses for 2 years prior to age 50, for 1 year after age 50, or by two elevated follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) values \u226520\u201330\u00a0IU/l while off hormonal methods for at least 2 weeks.

     "abstract": "Stroke is an important cause of death and disability. However, about two thirds of cerebrovascular events are initially minor. They carry a high risk of potentially severe recurrent events, but they also offer an opportunity for secondary prevention to avoid such recurrences. As most recurrent events occur within a short time after the initial presentation, secondary prevention has to be started as soon as possible. Dramatic risk reduction can be achieved with well-established drugs if used in a timely manner. A standard secondary preventive regimen will address multiple vascular risk factors and will usually consist of an antiplatelet agent, a lipid lowering drug, and an antihypertensive agent. Depending on the risk factor profile of each patient, this will have to be adjusted individually, for example, taking into account the presence of cardioembolism or of stenotic disease of the brain-supplying arteries. In recent years, the approach to treating these risk factors has evolved. In addition to absolute blood pressure, blood pressure variability has emerged as an important contributing factor to stroke risk, which is affected differently by different antihypertensive agents. New oral anticoagulants reduce the risk of cerebral haemorrhage and the need for regular blood checks. The best antiplatelet regimen for stroke prevention is still uncertain, and treatment of dyslipidaemia may change if trials with cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, which increase levels of HDL-cholesterol, are successful.

Successful treatment strategies have been so far limited and brain drug delivery remains a major challenge that restricts its treatment. This review provides an overview of the most promising emerging agents in the field of PD drug discovery, discussing improvements that have been made in brain drug delivery for PD. It will be shown that new approaches able to extend the length of the treatment, to release the drug in a continuous manner or to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and target a specific region are still needed.Overall, the results reviewed here show that there is an urgent need to develop both symptomatic and disease-modifying treatments, giving priority to neuroprotective treatments. Promising perspectives are being provided in this field by rasagiline and by neurotrophic factors like glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor. The identification of disease-relevant genes has also encouraged the search for disease-modifying therapies that function by identifying molecularly targeted drugs. The advent of new molecular and cellular targets like \u03b1-synuclein, leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine protein kinase 2 or parkin, among others, will require innovative delivery therapies. In this regard, drug delivery systems (DDS) have shown great potential for improving the efficacy of conventional and new PD therapy and reducing its side effects. The new DDS discussed here, which include microparticles, nanoparticles and hydrogels among others, will probably open up possibilities that extend beyond symptomatic relief. However, further work needs to be done before DDS become a therapeutic option for PD patients.",

     "abstract": "One of the principal beliefs in reproductive biology is that women have a finite ovarian reserve, which is fixed from the time they are born. This theory has been questioned recently by the discovery of ovarian stem cells which are purported to have the ability to form new oocytes under specific conditions post-natally. Almost a decade after their discovery, ovarian, or oogonial, stem cells (OSCs) have been isolated in mice and humans but remain the subject of much debate. Studies in mice have shown that these cells can be cultured to a mature oocyte stage in vitro, and when injected into germ-cell depleted ovary they can form follicles and have resulted in the birth of healthy offspring. There are few data from human OSCs but this finding would open the door to novel fertility preservation strategies for women with both age-related and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). As the number of girls and young women surviving cancer increases worldwide, POI secondary to gonadotoxic treatments, such as chemotherapy, is becoming more common. The ideal fertility preservation approach would prevent delays in commencing life-saving treatment and avoid transplanting malignant cells back into a woman after treatment: OSCs may offer one route to achieving this. This review summarises our current understanding of OSCs and discusses their potential clinical application in infertility treatment and fertility preservation.",

     "abstract": "Recent findings in stem cell biology have presented new perspectives and opportunities for the treatment of reproductive disease. In a departure from the long held dogma of embryologically fixed numbers of oocytes, current literature suggests that human ovaries contain stem cells which form new oocytes even in adulthood and that these stem cells can be cultured in vitro to develop into mature oocytes. These findings have provided new hope and broader options for fertility preservation. Evidence of endometrial regeneration by bone marrow stem cells in endometrial tissue of women who received bone marrow transplant highlight potential for the novel treatments of uterine disorders and supports new theories for the etiology of endometriosis \u2013 ectopic transdifferentiation of stem cells. Further, endometrial derived stem cells have been demonstrated to be useful in the treatment of several chronic and often debilitating diseases, including Parkinson's Disease and Diabetes. Other cells that may present future therapeutic benefits for a myriad of disease states include placental and fetal cells which enter maternal circulation during pregnancy and can later promote parenchymal regeneration in maternal tissue. These findings highlight novel functions of the uterus and ovaries. They demonstrate that the uterus is a dynamic organ permeable to fetal stem cells capable of transdifferentiation as well as a renewable source of multipotent stem cells. While we still have much to understand about stem cells, their potential applications in reproductive biology and medicine are countless.",

This resulted in a total of 20 articles which were included.Twelve studies on hypertension (HT) were inconsistent about the association with cognitive decline. For hypercholesterolemia (HC) 2 (out of 7) studies were associated with increased cognitive decline, as were both (2/2) studies which researched LDL-cholesterol. Articles were inconclusive about the effect of diabetes mellitus (DM): five (out of 13) found less cognitive decline, 2 found more cognitive decline, and 6 found no significant effect of DM.

Cells transfected only with the vector were used as control cells (EVC-cells). Medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), norethisterone (NET) and progesterone (P) were tested alone and in combination with a mixture of growth factors. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay.The growth factor mixture (GF) was able to induce cell proliferation in both cell types, however, the effect was much higher in the WT-12 cells. In WT-12 cells both MPA and NET alone significantly increased cell proliferation with values of 40% and 97%, respectively. Progesterone, however, had no effect. In combination with GF MPA significantly further enhanced cell proliferation as compared to the effect of MPA alone and GF alone in both cell lines. NET showed no further increase as compared to NET alone and P had no effect.We could demonstrate a significant proliferative effect of MPA when combined with high concentrations of growth factors. This effect was more pronounced in breast cancer cells overexpressing PGRMC1. These results may be of clinical relevance since in the combined WHI trial an increased breast cancer risk was found during treatment with conjugated equine estrogens plus MPA.",

The clinical examination included prolapse assessment (POP-Q) and palpation of the levator ani muscle. 4D transperineal ultrasound, supine and after voiding, was performed in all patients. Volume data sets were analysed for pelvic organ descent and measures of contractility and distensibility of the pelvic floor at a later date, blinded to all clinical data.Of 311 women seen during the inclusion period, 65% were postmenopausal.

The associations of physical activity (active vs inactive) and muscle strength (high vs low) within participants with low and high levels of visceral fat (assessed by ultrasonography) were tested using Univariate Analysis of Variance (difference in mean levels of the separate components of MetS) and logistic regression (risk on MetS).High levels of visceral fat were significantly associated with increased risk of MetS (OR 1.7 95%CI 1.5;1.9) and its separate components (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We did not find strong individual associations for physical activity or muscle strength, neither within men with low or high levels of visceral fat.High body fat levels were associated with an unhealthier metabolic risk profile and a higher risk of the MetS. Our cross-sectional data do not indicate associations for physical activity or for muscle strength with the MetS independent of visceral fat. Also no differential associations of physical activity or muscle strength in men with low or high levels of visceral fat were found.",

     "abstract": "Osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN) and matrix Gla protein (MGP) are markers of bone metabolism but they are also involved in vascular calcification. However, their precise role is not completely understood. Arterial stiffness is considered an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and it may be one of the causes of the increased cardiovascular risk associated with postmenopausal status. Medial and intimal calcification may increase arterial stiffness. The aim of our study was to assess the relationship of OPG, OPN and MGP with aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) as a marker of arterial stiffness in postmenopausal women.Circulating OPG, OPN and serum total MGP were measured in 144 postmenopausal women using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. Aortic PWV was determined by an oscillometric method.Osteoprotegerin correlated with age (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.27), aPWV (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.32) and hypersensitive C reactive protein (hsCRP) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.37), OPN correlated directly with hsCRP (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, r\u00a0=\u00a00.39) and inversely with high density lipoprotein cholesterol (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02, r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.02). No significant association was found between total MGP and clinical, biochemical and vascular parameters. The correlation between OPG and aPWV persisted even after the adjustment for various potential confounders (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02, r\u00a0=\u00a00.19). In multiple regression analysis in the whole study population the most important predictors of aPWV were OPG (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.230, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), hsCRP (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.212, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and systolic blood pressure (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.163, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

Ten items out of the 31 composing the original CS were selected according to their clinical relation with menopausal symptoms. Subsequently the short tool was used to assess menopausal symptoms and related factors among 1739 mid-aged women.The CS-10 displayed a mean (\u00b1SD) ICC value of 0.45 (\u00b10.06) and a Cronbach's alpha of 0.778 suggesting good internal reliability. For the entire sample median [interquartile range] CS-10 global scores were 10.0 [12.0], and for pre-, peri- and postmenopausal women: 8.0 [9.2], 9.0 [9.0] and 14.0 [14.0], respectively. Median global CS-10 scores significantly increased with menopausal status, marital status and ethnicity. Multiple linear regression analysis determined that higher global CS-10 scores (worse quality of life) correlated with age, parity, years since menopause, body mass index, ethnics (black) and smoking habit.The CS-10 seems to be a simple instrument that may aid everyday clinical consultation and help at performing an accurate diagnosis of menopause-related symptoms.

Items included: age, age and gender of line manager, educational level, job satisfaction; menopausal status; symptoms that were problematic for work; hot flushes; working conditions; work performance, disclosure to line managers; individual coping strategies; and, effective workplace adjustments and employer support.The final sample comprised 896 women. Menopausal transition caused difficulties for some women at work. The most problematic symptoms were: poor concentration, tiredness, poor memory, feeling low/depressed and lowered confidence. Hot flushes were particularly difficult. Some women felt work performance had been negatively affected. The majority of women were unwilling to disclose menopause-related health problems to line managers, most of whom were men or younger than them. Individual coping strategies were described. Four major areas for organisational-level support emerged: (i) greater awareness among managers about menopause as a possible occupational health issue, (ii) flexible working hours, (iii) access to information and sources of support at work, and (iv) attention to workplace temperature and ventilation.Employers and healthcare practitioners should be aware that menopausal transition causes difficulty for some women at work, and that much can be done to support them.",

Functional disability was assessed by the activities of daily living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (IADL) scales. The association of dietary patterns with ADL and IADL disability was analyzed by logistic regression adjusting for age, marital status, education, household income, region, chronic conditions, body mass index, smoking, alcohol drinking, physical activity, and energy intake.Two dietary patterns were identified in both men and women: the modified traditional dietary pattern, characterized by a relatively lower consumption of white rice, but higher consumption of fruits, dairy products, and legumes, and the traditional dietary pattern, characterized by high consumption of white rice. After controlling for covariates, in men, those who engaged in modified traditional dietary pattern, compared with traditional dietary pattern, showed a lower likelihood of ADL disability (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a00.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.05\u20130.56).

     "abstract": "Given the biological complexity of the ageing process, there is no single, simple and reliable measure of how healthily someone is ageing. Intervention studies need a panel of measures which capture key features of healthy ageing. To help guide our research in this area, we have adopted the concept of the \u201cHealthy Ageing Phenotype\u201d (HAP) and this study aimed to (i) identify the most important features of the HAP and (ii) identify/develop tools for measurement of those features.After a comprehensive assessment of the literature we selected the following domains: physiological and metabolic health, physical capability, cognitive function, social wellbeing, and psychological wellbeing which we hoped would provide a reasonably holistic characterisation of the HAP. We reviewed the literature and identified systematic reviews and/or meta-analysis of cohort studies, and clinical guidelines on outcome measures of these domains relevant to the HAP. Selection criteria for these measures included: frequent use in longitudinal studies of ageing; expected to change with age; evidence for strong association with/prediction of ageing-related phenotypes such as morbidity, mortality and lifespan; whenever possible, focus on studies measuring these outcomes in populations rather than on individuals selected on the basis of a particular disease; (bio)markers that respond to (lifestyle-based) intervention. Proposed markers were exposed to critique in a Workshop held in Newcastle, UK in October 2012.We have selected a tentative panel of (bio)markers of physiological and metabolic health, physical capability, cognitive function, social wellbeing, and psychological wellbeing which we propose may be useful in characterising the HAP and which may have utility as outcome measures in intervention studies. In addition, we have identified a number of tools which could be applied in community-based intervention studies designed to enhance healthy ageing.We have proposed, tentatively, a panel of outcome measures which could be deployed in community-based, lifestyle intervention studies. The evidence base for selection of measurement domains is less well developed in some areas e.g. social wellbeing (where the definition of the concept itself remains elusive) and this has implications for the identification of appropriate tools. Although we have developed this panel as potential outcomes for intervention studies, we recognise that broader agreement on the concept of the HAP and on tools for its measurement could have wider utility and e.g. could facilitate comparisons of healthy ageing across diverse study designs and populations.",

The purpose of this review is to highlight the efficacy and safety specific to oral estradiol and dydrogesterone combinations of four different dose strengths. A systematic literature search using Medline was carried out to identify studies containing efficacy or safety data. The findings of the retrieved publications confirm that estradiol and dydrogesterone combinations give very effective menopausal symptom relief and prevention of osteoporosis whilst maintaining a good safety profile. Data also show that these combinations of HRT give additional benefit to certain metabolic parameters including lipids, insulin, glucose and body fat distribution. By selecting the treatment and dose most suitable for each individual woman at her particular stage of menopause, the benefits can be optimized whilst mitigating the risks.

Stress events cause modification in hormonal balance with acute and chronic changes such as increase in cortisol and thyroid hormones, and simultaneous alterations in dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, testosterone and insulin like growth factor-1 levels. The ability to cope with stress and regain previous healthy status, also called resiliency, is particularly impaired in older persons Thus, stressful conditions and hormonal dysregulation might concur to the onset of cognitive impairment in this population.In this review we address the relationship between stress hormones and cognitive function in older persons focusing on the role of one of the main stress factors, such as sleep deprivation (SD).We extracted and cross-checked data from 2000 to 2013 March and selected 112 full-text articles assessed for eligibility. In particular we considered 68 studies regarding the contribution of hormonal pathway to cognition in older adults, and 44 regarding hormones and SD both in rats and humans.We investigated how the activation of a stress-pattern response, like the one evoked from SD, can influence cognitive development and worsen cognitive status in the elderly.We will show the limited number of studies targeting the effects of SD and the consequent changes in stress hormones on cognitive function in this age group.We conclude that the current literature is not strong enough to give definitive answers on the role of stress hormonal pathway to the development of cognitive impairment in older individuals.",

This debilitating symptom is especially prominent in the elderly and the obese, two growing populations in the Western world. It has further been found that women suffer more strongly from dyspnea than men. Despite optimization of disease-specific treatments, dyspnea is often inadequately treated. The immense burden faced by patients, families and the healthcare system makes improving management of chronic dyspnea a priority.Dyspnea is a multidimensional sensation that encompasses an array of unpleasant respiratory sensations that vary according to underlying cause and patient characteristics. Biopsychological factors beyond disease pathology exacerbate the perception of dyspnea, increase symptom severity and reduce quality of life. Psychological state (especially comorbid anxiety and depression), hormone status, gender, body weight (obesity) and general fitness level are particularly important. Neuroimaging has started to uncover the neural mechanisms involved in the processing of sensory and affective components of dyspnea.Awareness of biopsychological factors beyond pathology is essential for diagnosis and treatment of dyspnea. Increasing understanding the interactions between biopsychological factors and dyspnea perception will enhance the development of symptomatic treatments that specifically address each patient's most pressing needs at a specific stage in life. Future neuroimaging research can provide objective markers to fully understand the role of biopsychological factors in the perception of dyspnea in the hope of uncovering target areas for pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapy.",

There is consensus that habitual physical exercise can offer protection against certain types of cancer; however the evidence linking immunological mechanisms, exercise, and reduced cancer risk remain tentative. Multiple studies published over the last two decades suggest that exercise can mitigate the deleterious effects of age on immune function, thus increasing anti-cancer immunity. The potential ameliorative effect of exercise on these mechanisms include evidence that physical activity is able to stimulate greater NK-cell activity, enhance antigen-presentation, reduce inflammation, and prevent senescent cell accumulation in the elderly. Here we discuss the role played by the immune system in preventing and controlling cancer and how aging may retard these anti-cancer mechanisms. We also propose a pathway by which exercise-induced alterations in immunosenescence may decrease the incidence of cancer and help improve prognosis in cancer patients.",

Repeated BP measurements were obtained in four waves from 851 women who underwent ApoE genotyping at baseline (88.3% of those enrolled), and multi-level random-effects pattern-mixture models were used to evaluate the age-related BP trajectories, while accounting for non-ignorable dropouts/deaths and handling heterogeneities as random parameter variations. The few measurements (2.1%) made during hormone replacement therapy were excluded from the analysis.Alcohol consumption was associated with high levels of systolic and diastolic BP in an age\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0genotype-dependent manner only in the non-obese women (BMI\u00a0<\u00a027\u00a0kg/m2). Among those with the \u025b3/3 genotype, the differences in systolic and diastolic levels between drinkers and non-drinkers estimated at the age of 60 years were respectively 13.7\u00a0mmHg (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and 10.7\u00a0mmHg (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and disappeared in the older age groups, in which drinking was associated with systolic/diastolic hypertension if the non-obese women were \u025b4 carriers.In non-obese postmenopausal women, alcohol consumption is associated with systolic and diastolic hypertension early in those with the \u025b3/3 ApoE genotype, and late in \u025b4 carriers. We hypothesize the mediation of androgen hormones and the influence of ApoE genotypes on age at natural menopause. A better understanding of these mechanisms may guide better preventive choices.",

The Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) was used to assess the severity of menopause symptoms. The Stata 10 statistical package was used for all data analysis whereas Pearson's x2 nonparametric association test was used for bivariate analysis, adopting a level of statistical significance of 5%. On the multivariate analysis, independent variables positively associated with the dependent model were retained in the final model (p\u00a0<\u00a00.005).Overall, 54.1% of participants were premenopausal, 10.1% perimenopausal, and 35.8% postmenopausal. Irritability was the most frequent symptom (78.3%), followed by joint and muscular discomfort (74.8%), and anxiety (72.7%). Mean total MRS score was 15.6\u00a0+\u00a08.8 (median 15).

Though many studies have examined the relationships between bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition, little is known regarding the relationship between BMD and BMR.The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between BMR, anthropometric parameters, body composition and BMD in postmenopausal women in Taiwan.Two hundred and eighty-nine women between the ages of 40 and 80 years were included in this cross-sectional study. The following parameters were assessed: height, body weight, total body fat (TBF), BMR, waist-to-hip ratio, grip strength, and back strength. Differences in all variables between osteoporotic and non-osteoporotic women (categorized according to decades in age) were calculated using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and a Bonferroni post-hoc test. Multiple linear regression with a backward stepwise approach was performed to evaluate the relationship between these measurements and BMD.Among women over 50 years of age, those who were non-osteoporotic had higher BMR, BMI, and body fat by comparison to their osteoporotic counterparts (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for all). Multiple linear regression revealed that BMR and body fat significantly predicted BMD of the femoral neck (adjusted beta coefficients of 0.304 and 0.190, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for both). BMR and body fat also predicted an increased vertebral BMD (adjusted beta coefficients of 0.310 and 0.141, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for both).BMR is closely associated with BMD in elderly persons, and may be a novel target for interventions aimed at preventing the age-related decline in BMD.",

We investigated the effect of black cohosh on the plasminogen activator system in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).VSMCs were isolated from rat aortae. Expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) proteins were evaluated by Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The activities of PAI-1 and t-PA in the conditioned media were assessed by fibrin overlay zymography. A 40% 2-propanol extract of black cohosh was used.Black cohosh extract (BcEx) stimulated the protein expression of PAI-1, but it did not affect that of t-PA. Vitamin E, a potent antioxidant, inhibited the BcEx-induced increase in PAI-1 expression, while ICI 182,780, an estrogen receptor antagonist, had no effect. Fibrin overlay zymography revealed that BcEx increased the activity of PAI-1 in the conditioned media, while concurrently decreasing that of free t-PA by inducing a binding to PAI-1.BcEx induces PAI-1 protein expression in the VSMCs likely via an oxidant mechanism. It also stimulates the enzyme activity of PAI-1 and reduces that of free t-PA. These findings suggest that black cohosh might exert a negative influence on fibrinolysis.",

Sarcopenia, loss of muscle mass and/or function, is also associated with several age-related conditions, suggesting that the severity of menopausal symptoms may be associated with sarcopenia. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between Kupperman index scores, a measure of menopausal symptom severity, and muscle strength and quality in peri- and post-menopausal women.Cross-sectional study.A total of 148 women participated. Biomarkers of metabolic risk factors were assessed along with muscle mass as measured with Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry. Handgrip strength was measured with isometric dynamometry. Muscle quality was calculated as the ratio of strength to muscle mass in upper extremities.Kupperman index scores correlated with the depression scale, handgrip strength, and specific force after adjusting for age and body mass index. Mean handgrip strength and specific force decreased gradually according to menopausal symptom severity. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the fourth handgrip strength and specific force quartiles were associated with the prevalence of severe menopausal symptoms with adjusted odds ratios of 0.14 (95% confidence interval 0.03\u20130.68) and 0.09 (95% confidence interval 0.03\u20130.47), respectively.Lower handgrip strength was associated with severe menopausal symptoms. Although we could not determine causality, muscle strength and quality during menopause may be related to the severity of menopausal symptoms.

Worry that vaginal discomfort would never go away was expressed by 28% and 38% of women in Northern and Southern Europe, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while 21% and 27% worried that vaginal discomfort would ruin their future sex life (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Half of women who avoided intimacy worried about painful sex. Among men, 86% wanted their partner to talk about symptoms; two-thirds felt comfortable with this. In Northern and Southern Europe, 15% and 11% of men, respectively, feared that discussing vaginal discomfort would ruin intimacy, while 29% and 19% believed that vaginal discomfort was a big problem in their sex life. Men with partners who avoided intimacy recognised that worry about painful sex was the main reason. Vaginal discomfort impaired self-esteem and emotional wellbeing among women, while local oestrogen treatment improved relationships, particularly in Southern Europe.Vaginal discomfort impairs quality of life in postmenopausal women and their partners. Southern European women were generally more worried about long-term effects on their relationship, and were more likely to report benefits after treatment.",

     "abstract": "Telomeres, the protective structures at the outmost ends of chromosomes, shorten in all somatic cells with each cell-division and by cumulative oxidative damage. To counteract that these shortened telomeres are passed on to offspring, the telomeres are elongated by the enzyme, telomerase, during human spermatogenesis. A few groups have tried to elucidate this process by measuring telomerase activity in the various cell-types during spermatogenesis, but until now, no one has ever measured telomere length (TL) during these different stages in humans. Some groups have measured TL in spermatozoa and surprisingly found that telomeres of older men are longer, than those from younger men. To elucidate this phenomenon we investigated if the distribution of TL over the various precursor germ cells in old males differed from young males, perhaps indicating a more ubiquitous telomere elongation in testes from older men. We therefore obtained testicular biopsies from 6 older and 6 younger men undergoing vasectomy. The cells were suspended as single cells and smeared onto slides, followed by characterization of cell stages by phase contrast microscopy. Mean TL in individual cells was subsequently measured by telomere QFISH. Our data revealed no difference in the TL profile during spermatogenesis between younger and older men. All men had a similar profile which strongly resembled the telomerase expression profile found by others. This indicates that the longer telomeres in older men are not caused by a wider window of telomere elongation, stretching over more cell-types of spermatogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Despite cardiovascular disease (CVD) being by far the most common cause of death in women worldwide, awareness is low. Myocardial infarction occurs 10 years later in women than in men. Symptoms may be atypical: dyspnea rather than chest pain. Also more women than men have myocardial infarction with normal coronary angiography, probably due to microvascular disease or coronary spasm. The prognosis of non-obstructive disease is now recognized to be the same than for obstructive disease. The conventional risk factors for CVD are the same for both genders but have a different impact for women. One example is psychosocial stress and angina pectoris can more often be induced by mental stress in women than in men. Also there are risk factors specific to women such as a history of pre-eclampsia, gestational hypertension or diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Furthermore atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke more in women than in men. However, 6 out of 10 deaths from CVD can be prevented by a healthy life style and dealing with preexisting risk factors. Hence it is important that gynecologists who start seeing women at an earlier age than cardiologists should be aware of cardiovascular disease.",

Its pathophysiology is characterized by negative protein and energy balance driven by a variable combination of reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism. Muscle wasting is encountered in virtually all chronic disease states in particular during advanced stages of the respective illness. Several pre-clinical and clinical studies are ongoing to ameliorate this clinical problem. The mechanisms of muscle wasting and cachexia in chronic diseases such as cancer, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic kidney disease are described. We discuss therapeutic targets and such potential modulators as appetite stimulants, selective androgen receptor modulators, amino acids and naturally occurring peptide hormones.",

     "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a psychiatric disorder that occurs mainly in female adolescents and young women. The obsessive fear of weight gain, critically limited food intake and neuroendocrine aberrations characteristic of AN have both short- and long-term consequences for the reproductive, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and skeletal systems. Neuroendocrine changes include impairment of gonadotropin releasing-hormone (GnRH) pulsatile secretion and changes in neuropeptide activity at the hypothalamic level, which cause profound hypoestrogenism. AN is related to a decrease in bone mass density, which can lead to osteopenia and osteoporosis and a significant increase in fracture risk in later life. Rates of birth complications and low birth weight may be higher in women with previous AN. The condition is associated with fertility problems, unplanned pregnancies and generally negative attitudes to pregnancy. During pregnancy, women with the condition have higher rates of hyperemesis gravidarum, anaemia and obstetric complications, as well as impaired weight gain and compromised intrauterine foetal growth. It is reported that 80% of AN patients are affected by a cardiac complications such as sinus bradycardia, a prolonged QT interval on electrocardiography, arrythmias, myocardial mass modification and hypotension. A decrease in bone mineral density (BMD) is one of the most important medical consequences of AN. Reduced BMD may subsequently lead to a three- to seven-fold increased risk of spontaneous fractures. Untreated AN is associated with a significant increase in the risk of death. Better detection and sophisticated therapy should prevent the long-term consequences of this disorder. The aims of treatment are not only recovery but also prophylaxis and relief of the long-term effects of this disorder. Further investigations of the long-term disease risk are needed.",

     "abstract": "Total hip replacement (THR) is most often performed to treat end-stage symptomatic osteoarthritis. Patients typically present with increasing pain, restricted mobility and stiffness. In this procedure, the femoral head and part of the femoral neck are excised. The acetabulum is enlarged and an acetabular cup is inserted. The femoral head is replaced by a femoral component, the stem of which is inserted into the medullary canal of the femur. The components can be either cemented in place or press-fit (cementless). The THR concept was popularised by Sir John Charnley in the 1960s and although, over half a century of development has resulted in incremental improvements, the procedure is not dramatically different from the one he described. However, over the last two decades there have been significant changes in the types of bearing surfaces used. Metal on polyethylene continues to be the workhorse for the majority of cases. In the young and active, bearing surfaces with low wear rate are increasingly used. Since the early 1960s, THR has played an important role in alleviating pain and restoring mobility to millions of people. The cost-effectiveness of THR in treating advanced osteoarthritis makes it one of the most successful of all surgical interventions.",

     "abstract": "The number of hip fractures among Finns over 50-years of age rose constantly between 1970 and 1997, but since then, there has been a nationwide decline in incidence of hip fractures. One possible explanation, although not the only one, for the declining fracture rates, could be improved bone mineral density (BMD). The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in femoral neck BMD between older Finnish women born about a decade apart.We compared the baseline data of two population-based samples of home-dwelling 70\u201380-year-old women who were initially recruited in exercise intervention studies (N\u00a0=\u00a0216 in Cohort1, and N\u00a0=\u00a0389 in Cohort 2). Femoral neck BMD was measured with DXA. Between-cohort differences were evaluated with analysis of covariance using age, height, weight, and use of hormone therapy as covariates.The later-born Cohort 2 was somewhat older and taller than Cohort 1. Adjusted mean difference (95% CI) in femoral neck BMD between the cohorts was 0.043\u00a0g/cm2 (0.023\u20130.064) corresponding the mean difference of 0.36 (0.19\u20130.53) in T-score in favor of Cohort 2.Despite several factors that basically could have indicated lower mean BMD in Cohort 2, the finding was the opposite. This suggests that the mean femoral neck BMD has increased substantially among older Finnish women within a decade, but primary reason for this improvement remains unclear, but improved social and economic resources may have at least partly accounted for this favorable phenomenon.",

Among 11,212 women who were naturally menopausal at entry to the study or during follow-up through 2008, we assessed the relation of age at natural menopause to all-cause and cause-specific mortality.

Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for categories of age at menopause.Of 692 deaths identified during 91,829 person years of follow-up, 261 were due to cancer, 199 to cardiovascular diseases and 232 to other causes.

     "abstract": "Low plasma testosterone is associated with increased mortality in men. However, the relation between testosterone and cardiovascular disease is uncertain. We assessed the association of plasma sex hormones with the incidence of ischemic arterial disease (IAD) in elderly men.We used data from the French Three-City prospective cohort study (3650 men aged >65 years). A case-cohort design was set up including a random sample of 495 men and 146 incident cases of first IAD event (112 coronary heart disease (CHD) and 34 strokes) after a 4-year follow-up. Plasma total and bioavailable testosterone, total estradiol and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured at baseline. Multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for IAD were assessed using Cox model.After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, a J-shaped association between plasma total testosterone and IAD risk was found (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The HRs associated with the lowest and the highest total testosterone quintiles relative to the second quintile were 2.23 (95% CI: 1.02; 4.88) and 3.61 (95% CI: 1.55; 8.45) respectively. Additional analysis for CHD showed similar results (HR: 3.11, 95% CI: 1.27; 7.63 and HR: 4.75, 95% CI: 1.75; 12.92, respectively). Similar J-shaped association was observed between bioavailable testosterone and IAD risk (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). No significant association of estradiol and SHBG with IAD was found.High and low plasma testosterone levels are associated with an increased risk of IAD in elderly men. Optimal range of plasma testosterone may confer cardiovascular protection and these results may have clinical implications in the management of testosterone deficiency.",

Using CARDIA data, we compared the validity of six approaches for classifying perimenopause status in order to better understand the performance of classification techniques which can be applied to general cohort data. Specifically, we examined the validity of a self-reported question concerning changes in menstrual cycle length and two full prediction models using all available data concerning menstrual cycles as potential indicators of perimenopause. The validity of these three novel methods of perimenopause classification were compared to three previously established classification methods.For each method, women were classified as pre- or peri-menopausal at Year 15 of follow-up (ages 32\u201346). Year 15 perimenopause status was then used to predict Year 20 post-menopausal status (yes/no) to estimate measures of validity and area under the curve.The validity of the methods varied greatly, with four having an area under the curve greater than 0.8.When designing studies, researchers should collect the data required to construct a prediction model for classifying perimenopause status that includes age, smoking status, vasomotor symptoms, and cycle irregularities as predictors. The inclusion of additional data regarding menstrual cycles can be used to construct a full prediction model which may offer improved validity. Valid classification methods that use readily available data are needed to improve the scientific accuracy of research regarding perimenopause, promote research on this topic, and inform clinical practices.",

     "abstract": "In the past 40 years, female sports participation, particularly at the high school level, has significantly increased. Physical activity in females has numerous positive benefits, including improved body image and overall health. Unfortunately, a select population of exercising females may experience symptoms related to the female athlete triad, which refers to the interrelatedness of energy availability, menstrual function, and bone mineral density. Clinically, these conditions can manifest as disordered eating behaviors, menstrual irregularity, and stress fractures. Triad symptoms are distributed along a spectrum between optimal health and disease; all of the components of the triad may not be affected simultaneously.The female athlete triad was first identified in 1992. Since that time, a vast amount of research related to the identification, management and prevention of this condition has been published. More recently, research related to the long term effects of triad components has come into light. Women who were diagnosed with female athlete triad syndrome as adolescents and young adults in the 1990s are now in their 30s and 40s; negative long term effects of the female athlete triad, such as low bone mineral density, are now starting to manifest.Women of all ages should be assessed for triad components during routine annual physical examinations; appropriate measures to treat any current triad components should be implemented. In addition, women in their 30s, 40s and early 50s should be screened for a history of the female athlete triad. Multidisciplinary management of these conditions is strongly recommended.",

     "abstract": "With ageing populations a major challenge is to maintain physical and cognitive function, quality of life and independence. The literature does not only indicate important gender differences in lifestyle behaviours, but also how these behaviours might affect health outcomes. The current review has a male perspective when exploring lifestyle predictors of healthy ageing, such as physical activity and sedentary behaviours, smoking, diet and alcohol consumption. This review shows that not only do men with healthy lifestyles survive longer, but also with good health and disability is postponed and compressed into fewer years at the end of life. It is also clear that physical activity and smoking in midlife and late adulthood impact and predict healthy ageing in men. However, healthy ageing has no clear phenotypic definition and more research is needed to establish the impact on dietary and sedentary behaviours on healthy ageing in men. Adoption of healthier lifestyles could result in postponement of age associated diseases and/or the slowing down of the ageing process. Consequently, this allows independent living for a longer period of time and would reduce the burden to social and health care sectors.",

     "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a polygenetic, environmentally modifiable disease, which precipitates into fragility fractures of vertebrae, hip and radius and also confers a high risk of fractures in accidents and trauma. Aging and the genetic molecular background of osteoporosis cause delayed healing and impair regeneration. The worldwide burden of disease is huge and steadily increasing while the average life expectancy is also on the rise. The clinical need for bone regeneration applications, systemic or in situ guided bone regeneration and bone tissue engineering, will increase and become a challenge for health care systems. Apart from in situ guided tissue regeneration classical ex vivo tissue engineering of bone has not yet reached the level of routine clinical application although a wealth of scaffolds and growth factors has been developed. Engineering of complex bone constructs in vitro requires scaffolds, growth and differentiation factors, precursor cells for angiogenesis and osteogenesis and suitable bioreactors in various combinations. The development of applications for ex vivo tissue engineering of bone faces technical challenges concerning rapid vascularization for the survival of constructs in vivo. Recent new ideas and developments in the fields of bone biology, materials science and bioreactor technology will enable us to develop standard operating procedures for ex vivo tissue engineering of bone in the near future. Once prototyped such applications will rapidly be tailored for compromised conditions like vitamin D and sex hormone deficiencies, cellular deficits and high production of regeneration inhibitors, as they are prevalent in osteoporosis and in higher age.",

     "abstract": "Dietary supplements are popular among patients with prostate cancer (PC). The objective of this systematic review was to critically examine double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of non-herbal dietary supplements and vitamins (NHDS) for evidence that prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were reduced in PC patients. Five databases were searched from their inception through December 2012 to identify studies that met our inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Cochrane tool. Eight RCTs met the eligibility criteria and were of high methodological quality. The following supplements were tested: isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, and glycitein), minerals (Se) or vitamins (vitamin D) or a combination of antioxidants, bioflavonoids, carotenoids, lycopenes, minerals (Se, Zn, Cu, and Mg), phytoestrogens, phytosterols, vitamins (B2, B6, B9, B12, C, and E), and other substances (CoQ10 and n-acetyl-l cysteine). Five RCTs reported no significant effects compared with placebo. Two RCTs reported that a combination of antioxidants, isoflavones, lycopenes, minerals, plant oestrogens and vitamins significantly decreased PSA levels compared with placebo. One RCT did not report differences in PSA levels between the groups. In conclusion, the hypothesis that dietary supplements are effective treatments for PC patients is not supported by sound clinical evidence. There are promising data for only two specific remedies, which contained a mixture of ingredients, but even for these supplements, additional high quality evidence is necessary before firm recommendations would be justified.",

     "abstract": "Adolescence has long been regarded as a transition from childhood to adulthood. More recently it is become a concern of those wishing to avoid adverse health outcomes during middle and late adulthood. Most of this effort has been focused on behavioural risk factors such as tobacco and excessive alcohol use, physical exercise habits, dietary habits, as well as sexual and injury-related behaviours. The concern is that these habits are established during adolescence, continue into adulthood, and come to constitute ongoing risk factors for adverse health outcomes during middle and late adulthood. There is good reason to criticize this approach. These behaviours are themselves shaped by adolescents\u2019 living and working conditions and even then constitute a small proportion of the variance predicting adverse health outcomes during adulthood. More complex models of how adolescence serves as a gateway to adult health outcomes are presented. These are the socio-environmental, public policy, and political economy approaches. The argument is made that adolescence is a period during which public policy plays an especially important role in predicting future health outcomes. Yet, these public policies influence health all across the life span with adolescence providing only one of many important periods during which public policy shapes health prospects during middle and later adulthood. Ultimately one should consider a range of approaches ranging from the behavioural to the political to examine how adolescence serves as a gateway towards future adult prospects. An Adolescent Gateway Towards Adult Health Model is provided to assist in this process.",

In the present article we review key studies regarding the current knowledge for blood pressure (BP) goals in people with diabetes, the treatment used and the possible diabetogenic effects of antihypertensive drugs, as well as the beneficial and non-beneficial combinations of antihypertensive drugs in diabetic patients. Early placebo controlled trials proved the beneficial outcome of BP lowering in diabetic patients with initially high BP levels. More recent trials examined the impact of intensive compared to less intensive BP goals in diabetic populations. However, initial BP goals had significant differences from final achieved BP levels. Accordingly, current data support initiation of antihypertensive drug treatment in all patients with diabetes and systolic BP \u2265140\u00a0mmHg, with the aim to lower it consistently <140\u00a0mmHg, although how far below 140\u00a0mmHg the systolic BP goal should be is not clear. Available literature indicates that more than one drug is commonly used to achieve target BP. Drugs acting on the renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone axis have been shown to act protectively on diabetic nephropathy, while \u03b2-blockers and diuretics seem to have a diabetogenic effect. Interestingly, recent studies examining the role of combined use of available renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone axis blockers versus its separate use exhibited an increased incidence of adverse outcome in diabetic patients who used combinations of drugs that act against renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system.

BRCA-1 mutations have also been associated with occult primary ovarian insufficiency (OPOI), as have different mutations of the FMR1 gene. We, therefore, hypothesized that FMR1 genotypes may be associated with menarcheal and menopausal ages of BRCA mutation carriers.We compared the FMR1 genotype and sub-genotype distribution in 99 BRCA1/2 positive women and in 182 healthy women without a known history of familial breast and ovarian cancer and searched for associations with age at menarche and menopause. T-test was used to assess differences in menarcheal and menopause ages, with times of menarche and menopause as continuous variables.Women with BRCA1/2 mutations showed significantly different FMR1 genotype and sub-genotype distributions when compared with the control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This result remained stable in a sub-group analysis of Caucasian BRCA1/2 carriers and healthy controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In addition, BRCA1/2 carriers indicated a trend toward shorter reproductive lifespan (p\u00a0=\u00a00.18).Our data confirm the previously reported highly skewed distribution of FMR1 genotypes and sub-genotypes toward a high preponderance of low FMR1 alleles in BRCA1/2 carriers. We could demonstrate that BRCA-1 mutations are associated with an earlier onset of menopause compared to BRCA-2 carriers, although the distribution of the het-norm/low genotype is similar in both groups. Our findings suggest that there may be other factors beside the genotype that has an influence on menarche and especially menopause age in BRCA mutation carriers.",

The study sample was divided into non-sarcopenic, presarcopenic, sarcopenic and non-classified groups according to quartiles of RSMI i.e. relative skeletal muscle index (appendicular muscle mass (kg)/square of height (m)), hand grip strength (kPa) and walking speed.In logistic regression analysis sarcopenic women had 12.9 times higher odds of having osteoporosis (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001, OR\u00a0=\u00a012.9; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a03.1\u201353.5) in comparison to non-sarcopenic women. In comparison to women in the highest grip strength quartile, women within the lowest quartile had 11.7 times higher odds of having osteoporosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, OR\u00a0=\u00a011.7; 2.6\u201353.4). Sarcopenic women had 2.7 times higher odds of having fractures than their non-sarcopenic counterparts (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.732; 1.4\u20135.5). Sarcopenic women had also 2.1 times higher risk of falls during the preceding 12 months compared to non-sarcopenic women (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.1; 1.1\u20133.9). Adjustment for age, body mass index (BMI), physical activity and hormone therapy (HT) did not significantly alter these results.The components of clinical sarcopenia are strongly associated with osteoporosis. Grip strength is the most significant measurement to reveal the association between sarcopenia and osteoporosis, falls and fractures.",

Biopsy is mainly undertaken as an outpatient procedure, but sampling is \u2018blind\u2019. Hysteroscopy is used when focal lesions affecting the uterine cavity are suspected such as endometrial polyps or sub-mucous fibroids.None of the available methods are perfect. Ultrasound evaluation is dependent on the experience of the examiner, the equipment and the quality of visualization. Hysteroscopy too is dependent on the examiner and fibroids may obstruct visualization. Blind endometrial biopsy procedures often miss focal lesions. Thus re-examination is necessary when symptoms persist and no explanation for these has been identified.This clinical guide will evaluate the different methods of endometrial assessment, their indications and limitations. Guidance is also given about dealing with inconclusive investigations and persistent symptoms.",

We have reviewed publications on the impact of coffee on a series of health outcomes.Articles published between January 1990 and December 2012 were selected after crossing coffee or caffeine with a list of keywords representative of the most relevant health areas potentially affected by coffee intake.Caffeine, chlorogenic acids and diterpenes are important components of coffee. Tolerance often acts as a modulator of the biological actions of coffee. There is a significant impact of coffee on the cardiovascular system, and on the metabolism of carbohydrates and lipids. Contrary to previous beliefs, the various forms of arterial cardiovascular disease, arrhythmia or heart insufficiency seem unaffected by coffee intake. Coffee is associated with a reduction in the incidence of diabetes and liver disease. Protection seems to exist also for Parkinson's disease among the neurological disorders, while its potential as an osteoporosis risk factor is under debate. Its effect on cancer risk depends on the tissue concerned, although it appears to favor risk reduction. Coffee consumption seems to reduce mortality.The information gathered in recent years has generated a new concept of coffee, one which does not match the common belief that coffee is mostly harmful. This view is further supported by the discovery of a series of phyto-components with a beneficial profile. Reasonable optimism needs to be tempered, however, by the insufficiency of the clinical data, which in most cases stem from observational studies.",

This highlights the need for more rigorous research into CAM. This article is aimed at critically reviewing surveys that examine the prevalence of CAM use by menopausal women worldwide. Eleven databases were searched for peer-reviewed surveys published in any language between 01 January 2000 and 27 October 2012. The bibliographies of the retrieved articles and relevant book chapters were also hand searched. Twenty-six surveys were identified, and they included a total of 32,465 menopausal women. The majority of these surveys were of poor methodological quality. Based on 6 surveys, 32.9% of women stated they were current/regular CAM users. Based on 9 surveys, 50.5% of women reported that they used CAM specifically for their menopausal symptoms. The average 12-month prevalence of CAM use was 47.7% (range: 33.1\u201356.2). Fifty-five percent of women did not disclose their use of CAM to their healthcare professional. The majority of women sought information about CAM from the media. The most popular CAM modality was herbal medicine, followed by soy/phytoestrogens, evening primrose oil, relaxation and yoga. There are a large number of predominantly low-quality surveys monitoring the prevalence of CAM use among menopausal women worldwide. The available evidence suggests that the prevalence of CAM use is high.",

     "abstract": "In healthy adults microbial communities that colonise different regions of the human colon contribute nutrients and energy to the host via the fermentation of non-digestible dietary components in the large intestine. A delicate balance of microbial species is required to maintain healthy metabolism and immune function. Disturbance in this microbial balance can have negative consequences for health resulting in elevated inflammation and infection, that are contributory factors in diabetes and cancer. There is a growing awareness that the microbial balance in the colon may become increasingly perturbed with aging and therefore hasten the onset of certain diseases. Societal and dietary factors influence microbial community composition both in the short and long term in the elderly (>65 years old) whilst immunosenescence may also be linked to a perturbed distal gut microbiota and frailty in the elderly. Significant progress has been made in defining some of the dominant members of the microbial community in the healthy large intestine and in identifying their roles in metabolism. There is therefore an urgent need for better awareness of the impact of diet, prebiotic and probiotic strategies in driving human colonic microbial composition in order to understand the possibilities for maintaining healthy gut function and well-being in an increasingly elderly population. Here we review gut microbial changes associated with aging and how diet, prebiotics and probiotics may modulate the gut microbiota to maintain health in the elderly.",

Falls lead to moderate to severe injuries, fear of falling, loss of independence and death in a third of those patients. The direct costs alone from fall related injuries are a staggering 0.1% of all healthcare expenditures in the United States and up to 1.5% of healthcare costs in European countries. This figure does not include the indirect costs of loss of income both to the patient and caregiver, the intangible losses of mobility, confidence, and functional independence. Numerous studies have attempted to define the risk factors for falls in older adults. The present review provides a brief summary and update of the relevant literature, summarizing demographic and modifiable risk factors. The major risk factors identified are impaired balance and gait, polypharmacy, and history of previous falls. Other risk factors include advancing age, female gender, visual impairments, cognitive decline especially attention and executive dysfunction, and environmental factors. Recommendations for the clinician to manage falls in older patients are also summarized.",

We also studied the effect of the type of statin, dose, pharmacokinetic properties, and length of treatment, on BTM.Five hundred subjects (21%) were taking statins (273 women and 227 men).

All the statins users had lower levels of BTM than non-users, except subjects taking fluvastatin that showed slightly higher values. In the whole sample, no differences between dose or drug-potency were noted regarding BTM. When comparing with non-statin users, only subjects taking lipophilic statins had lower BTM levels (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

These reported changes in the secretion and response of both central and peripheral hormones that regulate appetite. Anorexia, very prevalent among hospitalized and institutionalized elderly people, is associated with comorbidity and represents a predictive factor for mortality. No treatment for it has been proved to be effective. The mechanism regulating ingestion in elderly people is complex and difficult to resolve. Comorbidity as a cause or a consequence of anorexia of ageing has become a research field of great interest in geriatrics. A correct nutritional evaluation is a fundamental part of an integrated geriatric assessment.",

     "abstract": "The worldwide increasing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) poses an immense public health hazard leading to a variety of complications such as cardiovascular diseases, nephropathy and neuropathy. Diet, as a key component of a healthy human lifestyle, plays an important role in the prevention and management of T2DM and its complications. The dietary n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been associated with various favourable functions such as anti-inflammatory effects, improving endothelial function, controlling the blood pressure, and reducing hypertriglyceridemia and insulin insensitivity. According to some epidemiological studies, a lower prevalence of T2DM was found in populations consuming large amounts of seafood products, which are rich in n-3 PUFAs. However, the evidence on the relation between fish intake, dietary n-3 PUFAs, and risk of T2DM is controversial. Therefore, this paper aimed to review the epidemiological and clinical studies on the role of dietary n-3 PUFAs in T2DM. Also, the limitations of these studies and the need for potential further research on the subject are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Chronic disease has financial consequences for older adults, but it is unclear how this varies between conditions with different disease trajectories. The aim of this study was to review evidence on the financial burden associated with cancer, heart failure or stroke in older people, to identify those most at risk of financial adversity. We systematically searched nine databases for studies with data on the illness-related financial burden (objective), or on the perception of financial hardship (subjective), of older patients and/or their informal caregivers in high-income countries. We identified thirty-eight papers published in English between 1984 and 2012. Studies fell into three categories: those reporting direct, out of pocket, costs (medical and/or non-medical); studies of the indirect costs associated with illness (such as wage or income loss); and papers reporting general financial or economic burdens secondary to illness. Three out of four studies focused on people with cancer. More affluent people had greater out of pocket costs, but were less financially burdened by illness, compared with older adults from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Disadvantaged patients and families were more likely to report experiences of financial hardship, and spend a higher proportion of their income on all expenses related to their diagnoses. This review illustrates how little is known about the financial adversity experienced by patients with some common chronic conditions. It raises the possibility that higher expenditure by more affluent older people may be creating inequalities in how chronic illness is experienced. The development of effective strategies for financial protection at older ages will require more information on who is affected and at which point in their illness trajectory.",

The aim of this study was to examine the association between the use of different classes of psychotropic medications, especially short acting benzodiazepines, and the frequency of falling in elderly.Study design This retrospective cohort study was performed with patients who visited the day clinic of the department of geriatric medicine of the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands between 1 January 2011 and 1 April 2012.Measurements Frequencies of falling in the past year and medication use were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the relationship between the frequency of falling in the past year and the use of psychotropic medications.During this period 404 patients were included and 238 (58.9%) of them had experienced one or more falls in the past year. After multivariate adjustment, frequent falls remained significantly associated with exposure to psychotropic medications (odds ratio [OR] 1.96; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17\u20133.28), antipsychotics (OR 3.62; 95% CI 1.27\u201310.33), hypnotics and anxiolytics (OR 1.81; 95% CI 1.05\u20133.11), short-acting benzodiazepines or Z-drugs (OR 1.94; 95% CI 1.10\u20133.42) and antidepressants (OR 2.35; 95% CI 1.33\u20134.16).This study confirms that taking psychotropic medication, including short-acting benzodiazepines, strongly increases the frequency of falls in elderly. This relation should be explicitly recognized by doctors prescribing for older people, and by older people themselves.

CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2. Factor analysis of metabolic syndrome components was conducted and factor scores were used as independent variables in multivariable logistic regression models.The prevalence of CKD was highest among Malays (21.0% vs. 7.4%, 5.9% in Indians and Chinese). Factor analysis identified three factors among Chinese (glycemia, blood pressure [BP], and obesity/lipid) and Malays (glycemia, BP, and lipids) accounting for 70% of the variance and four factors (glycemia, BP, lipids, and obesity) among Indians accounting for 82% of the variance. Glycemia was positively associated with CKD in all three ethnic groups. BP was positively associated with CKD among Malays (OR [95% CI] of 1.16 [1.06\u20131.28]), whereas it showed an inverse association among Chinese (0.84 [0.71\u20130.99]) and Indians (0.84 [0.73\u20130.97]). However, this inverse association lost significance after adjusting for antihypertensive medication use in Chinese and Indians. Obesity/lipids among Chinese and obesity among Indians showed a positive association; lipids showed an inverse association among Malays.These data suggest that while hyperglycemia was associated with CKD in all three ethnic groups, the impact of BP, lipids, obesity on CKD varies across ethnic groups.

Our objective was to compare the pharmacokinetics of the commonly used compounded preparations with conventional hormonal preparations that are considered bioequivalent in practice.We conducted a randomized, blinded, four-arm 16-day clinical trial of forty postmenopausal women assigned to one of three doses of a compounded estrogen cream (Bi-est (80:20); 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0\u00a0mg)\u00a0+\u00a0compounded oral progesterone 100\u00a0mg, or to a conventional estradiol patch (Vivelle-Dot\u2122 0.05\u00a0mg)\u00a0+\u00a0Prometrium\u2122 100\u00a0mg. Serum levels of estrone, estradiol, estriol, and progesterone were obtained at multiple time intervals during the first 24-h, and at steady-state.Results were analyzable for 37/40 women. Study medications were well tolerated. The AUC at 24\u00a0h and at steady-state for estrogens remained consistently lower for all doses of Bi-est tested relative to the patch. The difference was statistically significant for Bi-est 2.0\u00a0mg (AUC-estradiol\u00a0=\u00a0181 vs. 956; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and 2.5\u00a0mg (AUC-estradiol\u00a0=\u00a0286 vs. 917; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Estriol levels remained low in all study arms. Serum progesterone levels were comparable in conventional vs. compounded groups.This pharmacokinetic trial showed that the currently used doses of compounded hormones yield lower levels of estrogen compared to the standard-dose estradiol patch. To find comparable doses, further studies are needed. This successfully conducted randomized controlled study attests to the feasibility of using a similar design in the setting of a larger clinical trial.",

Currently InterLACE draws on individual level data for reproductive health and chronic disease among 200,000 women from over thirteen studies of women's health in seven countries. The rationale for this multi-study research programme is set out in terms of a life course perspective to reproductive health. The research programme will build a comprehensive picture of reproductive health through life in relation to chronic disease risk. Although combining multiple international studies poses methodological challenges, InterLACE represents an invaluable opportunity to strength evidence to guide the development of timely and tailored preventive health strategies.",

The women completed an online questionnaire.The questionnaire involved a discrete choice experiment to determine women's willingness to pay for different characteristics of therapy. Time of LET appliance, use of disposable applicators with small tablets compared with both dosing syringes with vaginal cream and vagitories, and therapy that did/did not cause smudges/leakage were all considered.The women had no significant preference as to the time of day LET should be used. However, quantifying other preferences suggested that respondents were willing to pay \u20ac66.58 or \u20ac60.32 per month extra for using disposable applicators with small tablets rather than dosing syringes with vaginal cream or vagitories, respectively, and to avoid smudges/leakage.This survey suggests that women may prefer using disposable applicators with small tablets to deliver LET and value therapy that does not cause smudges/leakage.

     "abstract": "Two independent but inter-related conditions that have a growing impact on healthy life expectancy and health care costs in developed nations are an age-related loss of muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia) and obesity. Sarcopenia is commonly exacerbated in overweight and obese individuals. Progression towards obesity promotes an increase in fat mass and a concomitant decrease in muscle mass, producing an unfavourable ratio of fat to muscle. The coexistence of diminished muscle mass and increased fat mass (so-called \u2018sarcobesity\u2019) is ultimately manifested by impaired mobility and/or development of life-style-related diseases. Accordingly, the critical health issue for a large proportion of adults in developed nations is how to lose fat mass while preserving muscle mass. Lifestyle interventions to prevent or treat sarcobesity include energy-restricted diets and exercise. The optimal energy deficit to reduce body mass is controversial. While energy restriction in isolation is an effective short-term strategy for rapid and substantial weight loss, it results in a reduction of both fat and muscle mass and therefore ultimately predisposes one to an unfavourable body composition. Aerobic exercise promotes beneficial changes in whole-body metabolism and reduces fat mass, while resistance exercise preserves lean (muscle) mass. Current evidence strongly supports the inclusion of resistance and aerobic exercise to complement mild energy-restricted high-protein diets for healthy weight loss as a primary intervention for sarcobesity.",

     "abstract": "Informal care provision is an activity in which individuals are increasingly likely to become involved across their life course, and particularly in later life, as a result of demographic changes such as increasing longevity and changes in co-residential living arrangements in later life. Academic research so far has highlighted the adverse impact of informal care provision on the financial position of the carer, however, the evidence on the impact of informal care provision on the carer's physical, mental and emotional health, and on their mortality, presents a more complex picture. This paper reviews research from the UK and beyond on the provision of informal care and its subsequent impact on health and mortality outcomes. Two key findings emerge from this review paper. Firstly, the cross-sectional analysis of data shows mixed associations between informal care provision and poor health outcomes for the carer. Such research highlights the importance of the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the carer and the person cared for, and of the specific characteristics and nature of the care provided (e.g. duration, level). Secondly, longitudinal analysis, which typically benefits from a longer timeframe to follow up the impact of caring, shows that although informal care provision is not per se associated with adverse health and mortality outcomes, nevertheless particular types and durations of caring have shown negative outcomes.",

In midlife, women may encounter various hormonal and age-related physiologic changes that can lead to alterations in hair texture and growth. The most significant hormonal alteration is the onset of menopause in which there is a cessation of ovarian estrogen production. This decrease in estrogen is known to have deleterious effects on the skin and cutaneous appendages. As our understanding of the molecular and hormonal controls on the hair follicle has grown, there has been increased interest in the various modulators of hair growth, including the potential role of estrogen. Further study of hair changes in midlife women provides an important opportunity for identification of the complex regulation of hair growth as well as identification of treatment targets that may specifically benefit women. In this review, management of hair loss in midlife women is discussed with a focus on three most commonly encountered clinical conditions: female pattern hair loss, hair shaft alterations due to hair care, and telogen effluvium.",

Differences in the eNOS \u2212786T>C (rs2070744), 4a4b (rs61722009), and 894G>T (rs1799983) genotype frequencies between patients and controls were compared, and odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were determined as a measure of the strength of the association between the genotypes and POI.The POI patients had significantly decreased frequencies of the eNOS 894GT and \u2212786TT/894GT genotypes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025 and 0.027, respectively). However, the significant association between these eNOS polymorphisms and POI disappeared after adjustment for multiple comparisons (adjusted P\u00a0=\u00a00.075 and 0.081, respectively). The eNOS \u2212786T/894G haplotype is more frequent in patients than controls (P\u00a0=\u00a00.030), whereas the \u2212786T/894T haplotype was less frequent in patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.031). The associations between \u2212786/894 haplotypes and POI were confirmed by permutation tests. We did not find associations between the eNOS \u2212786T>C or 4a4b polymorphisms and POI.Our data suggest that the eNOS \u2212786T/894T haplotype is associated with a decreased POI risk, and we postulate that the eNOS \u2212786T/894T haplotype may confer less risk on POI occurrence by reducing pathologically increased NO generation by eNOS in POI. Further study is warranted to elucidate the effect of the eNOS 894G>T polymorphism and POI occurrence.",

This evaluation followed a previous control at the first year post-intervention.Sixty-three women were assessed five years after operation with the transobturator technique. Additionally, twenty-nine women of these women had undergone pelvic floor reconstruction due to different forms of genital prolapse. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed by the Urogenital Distress Inventory-6 (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7 (IIQ-7) tests.Subjective and objective cure or improvement, complications, and changes in QoL.Fifty women (79%) remained cured, as assessed by the cough test. Eighteen women (28%) reported urine leakage during physical activity. These objective and subjective data were worse than those reported at the one-year follow-up. De novo urge urinary incontinence was reported by 11 women or 17%. Nine of these women had undergone additional pelvic floor surgery. The QoL tests confirmed that cure or improvement was achieved in 78% (49) (UDI-6) and 79% (50) (IIQ-7) of the women.The transobturator tape procedure resulted in acceptable rates of efficacy after five years. Moreover, QoL tests showed cure or improvement in almost four of five women. Nonetheless, women should be informed of the risk of de novo urinary urgency incontinence and the progressive loss of efficacy with time.",

We included 402 patients, age 60 years and older, with hip related fractures. Operative treatment consisted of osteosynthesis or endoprothesis. ASA score, body mass index, Charlson Comorbidity Index, Barthel Index and Mini-Mental-Status were documented. We noted length of in-hospital stay and ICU stay as well as readmission to ICU and complications, including their dispersal according to Clavien\u2013Dindo Classification. After univariate analysis, a multivariate analysis was performed. The examined cohorts were 85 patients aged 60\u201374 years, 253 75\u201390 years old and 64 >90 year old patients. In-hospital periods (13\u201314 days) mean stay on ICU (2 days) and frequency of readmission on ICU did not significantly differ statistically. Most complications were grade II, with comparable frequency and modality, displaying no significant difference throughout age-related groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.461). In-hospital mortality showing significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014) only between 75\u201389 (4.4%) and >90-year-old (12.5%) cohort. Nevertheless, according to multivariate analysis, including the common risk factors, increased age was not an independent risk factor for dying (p\u00a0=\u00a00.132). Patients at an advanced age with hip-related fractures showed neither a prolonged in-hospital nor ICU stay. There was no significant relation of advanced age to number and type of complications.",

A 54-item questionnaire was used to capture knowledge and beliefs about, and confidence in BHT. Summary statistics and multivariate regression were used for analyses.Overall, 401 pharmacists completed the survey (response rate 20%). Respondents were mainly female (64%), above 30 years of age (81%) and in practice for more than 10 years (63%). Only 35% of respondents correctly classified BHT as including both compounding and commercial products. In regards to beliefs, 68% of respondents agreed that BHT is as effective as non-bioidentical hormones for vasomotor symptoms, while 60% agreed BHT had equal risk. Beliefs on estriol, progesterone, and saliva testing however, were more diverse with many \u201cdo not know\u201d responses (40%). In multivariate analysis, pharmacists who worked in pharmacies that compounded BHT were more likely to believe in BHT safety (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and have greater confidence with BHT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Results from this survey indicated that pharmacists had varying beliefs on BHT.

In the second, investigators assessed the novel CYP17 lyase inhibitor abiraterone prior to prostatectomy. Both studies provide a wealth of biological information, but the question remains \u2013 will preoperative systemic therapy ultimately be incorporated into clinical algorithms for prostate cancer? Herein, the existing literature for both preoperative hormonal and chemotherapeutic approaches is reviewed. We performed a MEDLINE search of published prospective and retrospective clinical studies assessing preoperative systemic therapy for prostate cancer from 1982 onwards, revealing a total of 75 publications meeting these criteria.

     "abstract": "The metaphor of a frail older person as a car running out of petrol seems to have resonance in the lay media. Though it may be an over simplistic representation of a complex and dynamic process, it does facilitate discussion with patients and their relatives about the appropriateness of interventions, such as whether or not there is enough fuel (physiological reserves) to get up a really steep hill (undergo a coronary bypass graft). It can also be used as a way to emphasise what can be done to help. For example, in some longitudinal studies, 5% of older patients are less frail after 5 years follow up, suggesting there are things that can still be done to \u201cfill up the tank\u201d. This review will consider whether drug therapies can fulfil this role.Frail older people are often prescribed long lists of medications but it is debatable whether current treatments actually address the causes or consequences of frailty itself. Here, we explore the associations between frailty and co-morbidity and evaluate whether the management of chronic disease may impact frailty development or progression. We consider how the management of hypertension may have an important role in the prevention of frailty, mediated by reduction of cerebrovascular disease, but why aggressive management of hypertension may have negative consequences for those who are already frail. We also summarise the evidence linking immunosenescence, inflammation and endocrine changes to frailty and investigate whether targeted drug therapy has the potential to influence frailty pathophysiology.",

For some time it was hoped that hormonal treatment for menopause would be beneficial for urinary incontinence because there are hormonal receptors in the urinary tract. The goal of this survey of current knowledge on the subject is to explore thoroughly the relationship between menopause and urinary incontinence.Our study is based on a review of the literature dealing with the epidemiology of urinary incontinence in women aged between 45 and 60, and the effects of hormonal treatment with respect to the symptoms of involuntary loss of urine.Analysis of the epidemiological data drawn from large cohorts shows that on the one hand, the menopause has little if any impact on the risk of urinary incontinence, and on the other hand that the effects of oestrogen medication on urinary incontinence vary according to how it is administered and the type of incontinence. The effect of oral hormone treatments for menopause is rather negative with respect to stress incontinence. Vaginal treatment appears to be beneficial for overactive bladder symptoms.",

In addition, from this total cohort a subcohort was selected for additional data collection and analyses, including 193 EC patients with DM and an age-matched sample of 195 EC patients without DM. Patients with FIGO stage IV as well as non-endometrioid histology were excluded.In the total cohort EC patients with DM had a significantly higher age (69 years vs. 64 years), higher FIGO stages and more additional comorbidities compared to EC patients without DM. The 5-year overall survival rate for EC patients with DM was significantly lower than for EC patients without DM (68% vs. 84%). After adjusting for age, stage, period of diagnosis, cardiovascular disease, and treatment, this significant effect of DM on overall mortality persisted (HR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.0\u20131.8).

BADL disability was defined as loss of the ability to perform bathing, grooming, dressing, toilet use, or feeding, while deterioration of mobility was defined as loss of ability to perform transfers, walk, or use stairs, and IADL disability as losing any of the activities included in the Lawton Index. The risk of presenting adverse events was determined by Cox and Kaplan\u2013Meier proportional hazard analysis and logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, function, and comorbidity.Mean follow-up was 534 days (SD 153), during which 105 participants (10.6%) died. Mean time to death was 363 days (SD 218), while 192 (25.4%) lost at least one BADL, 492 (60%) at least one IADL, and 222 (28.9%) lost mobility.

Physical function was measured by lung function (in men only), handgrip strength, leg strength, and physical activity. The associations between physical function and the dichotomized impaired physical ability and disability-score were estimated using Poisson regression.Better lung function and higher leg strength were associated with a lower risk of having impaired physical ability, RR\u00a0=\u00a00.98, 95% CI [0.96; 0.99] per 10\u00a0L/min and RR\u00a0=\u00a00.97, 95% CI [0.94; 0.99] per 10\u00a0Nm, respectively.Higher handgrip strength, leg strength and level of physical activity were associated with a lower risk of having ADL disability, RR\u00a0=\u00a00.72, 95% CI [0.57; 0.92] per 10\u00a0kg, RR\u00a0=\u00a00.95, 95% CI [0.92; 0.98] per 10\u00a0Nm, RR\u00a0=\u00a00.98, 95% CI [0.96; 0.99] per point-score, respectively.Additional adjustment for baseline ADL disability did not materially changed the point-estimates (except for handgrip strength).Overall, leg extensor strength was associated with both an impaired physical ability and ADL disability. Other measures of physical functioning were either related to an impaired physical ability or ADL disability. ADL disability may be an intermediate factor for hand grip strength in the causal chain from impaired physical ability to ADL disability at follow-up. The results of this study show that leg strength might be a relevant parameter to consider for future intervention studies.",

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is best prevented or managed by restricting the total amount of carbohydrate in the diet and by deriving carbohydrate energy from whole-grain cereals, fruits and vegetables. The substitution of saturated and trans-fatty acids by mono-unsaturated and omega-3 fatty acids is the most important dietary intervention for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Obesity is also a risk factor for a variety of cancers. Obese elderly persons should be encouraged to lose weight. Diet plans can follow the current recommendations for weight management but intake of protein should be increased to conserve muscle mass.The consumption of red or processed meat is associated with an increase of colorectal cancer. Adequate protein, calcium and vitamin D intake should be ensured for the prevention of osteoporotic fractures. Surveillance is needed for possible vitamin D deficiency in high risk populations. A diet rich in vitamin E, folate, B12 and omega-3 fatty acids may be protective against cognitive decline. With increasing longevity ensuring a healthy diet is a growing public health issue.",

     "abstract": "Marital status and living arrangements, along with changes in these in mid-life and older ages, have implications for an individual's health and mortality. Literature on health and mortality by marital status has consistently identified that unmarried individuals generally report poorer health and have a higher mortality risk than their married counterparts, with men being particularly affected in this respect. With evidence of increasing changes in partnership and living arrangements in older ages, with rising divorce amongst younger cohorts offsetting the lower risk of widowhood, it is important to consider the implications of such changes for health in later life. Within research which has examined changes in marital status and living arrangements in later life a key distinction has been between work using cross-sectional data and that which has used longitudinal data. In this context, two key debates have been the focus of research; firstly, research pointing to a possible selection of less healthy individuals into singlehood, separation or divorce, while the second debate relates to the extent to which an individual's transitions earlier in the life course in terms of marital status and living arrangements have a differential impact on their health and mortality compared with transitions over shorter time periods. After reviewing the relevant literature, this paper argues that in order to fully account for changes in living arrangements as a determinant of health and mortality transitions, future research will increasingly need to consider a longer perspective and take into account transitions in living arrangements throughout an individual's life course rather than simply focussing at one stage of the life course.",

Exercise can partially reverse the effects of the aging process on physiological functions and preserve functional reserve in the elderly. Numerous studies have shown that maintaining a minimum quantity and quality of exercise decreases the risk of death, prevents the development of certain cancers, lowers the risk of osteoporosis and increases longevity. Training programs should include exercises aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness and muscle function, as well as flexibility and balance. Though the benefits of physical activity appear to be directly linked to the notion of training volume and intensity, further research is required in the elderly, in order to develop more precise recommendations, bearing in mind that the main aim is to foster long-term adherence to physical activity in this growing population.",

     "abstract": "We examined gender-specific combined effects of smoking and hypertension on risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease in elderly Korean men and women.This study followed a cohort of 6097 residents (2593 men, 3504 women) in the general population of Kangwha County, aged \u226555 years in March 1985 and examined their cause-specific mortality for 20.8 years, up to December 31, 2005. All participants were followed up more than once after the 1985 survey.We calculated hazard ratios for mortality for the combined sets of smoking habits and blood pressure levels using the Cox proportional-hazard model. The set of non-smokers with normal blood pressure served as a reference group.During the 20.8 years of follow-up, 759 people died from cardiovascular disease. The risk of mortality from cardiovascular disease and stroke according to smoking or hypertension was not different between men and women. However, the risk among smokers combined with hypertension was higher in men than in women; the multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for mortality from cardiovascular disease and stroke were 4.52 (1.67\u201312.21) and 6.37 (1.57\u201325.85) in men and 2.11 (1.37\u20133.24) and 2.41 (1.44\u20134.01) in women, respectively.The magnitude of the joint effects of smoking and hypertension on cardiovascular disease and stroke mortality was different between men and women. This study suggests that combining quitting smoking with lowering blood pressure could contribute to preventing cardiovascular disease and stroke, especially in men.",

Active and sedentary behaviours were recorded by questionnaire.For both men and women, the higher prevalence of overweight-obesity, central obesity and overfat was found in those who spent sitting more than 4\u00a0h per day and walk less than 1\u00a0h, compared with those who spent sitting less than 4\u00a0h per day and walk more than 1\u00a0h (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, except for central obesity in women). In men, more than 4\u00a0h sitting per day was associated with 1.7-fold higher odds of having central obesity compared with those sitting less than 4\u00a0h per day (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In women, this sedentary behaviour increased the risk of overweight-obesity and overfat by 1.5 and 1.4, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Age or time spent walking did not significantly change these results.Sitting time increases the risk of overweight-obesity and overfat in women and the risk of central obesity in men, independently of walking time.",

Elevated serum uric acid levels, hypoadiponectinemia and arterial stiffness are strongly associated with cardiovascular diseases. We investigated the relationships among uric acid, adiponectin and arterial stiffness in postmenopausal women.9555 subjects who had the routine health check-ups, 841 postmenopausal women aged 50\u00a0years or older who had not had a menstrual period for more than 12 consecutive months were included in this study.BMI, WC, and serum concentrations of uric acid, adiponectin, glucose, lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol) were measured. Insulin resistance was estimated by the insulin resistance index of homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was evaluated to assess arterial stiffness.The subjects were stratified into three groups according to uric acid values. PWV values gradually increased and adiponectin level decreased with uric acid tertiles. Serum uric acid levels in postmenopausal women correlated significantly with age, BMI, WC, TG, HDL-C, insulin, HOMA-IR, adiponectin and PWV. Multiple regression analysis showed that WC (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.141, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), HOMA (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.137, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), adiponectin (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.104, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and PWV (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.129, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were independently correlated with uric acid levels. In multiple logistic regression analysis after adjusting for risk factors, uric acid was a significant contributor to increased PWV.These findings indicate that serum uric acid is independently associated with adiponectin and arterial stiffness in postmenopausal women.",

A structured questionnaire was used to collect data of demographics, menopausal status, chronic diseases, reproductive history, etc. Also we evaluated the severity of menopausal symptoms by Kupperman menopause index (KMI).Menopausal age and scorings of Kupperman menopause index.The overall median age at natural menopause was 50 years. Lower educational level, poor economic status, lower body mass index (BMI), age at menarche less than 14 years, nulliparity and smoking were associated with earlier onset of natural menopause (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The most frequently symptoms in postmenopausal women were sexual problems (57.05%), muscle/joint pain (53.29%) and insomnia (51.02%), while fatigue, insomnia and muscle/joint pain were predominant symptoms in pre- and peri-menopausal women. After adjusting for confounding factors, logistic regression analysis revealed that women with poor educational background, low income, divorce, higher BMI, higher parity, smoking and chronic diseases presented higher KMI scores (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The study provided an estimate of median age at natural menopause in Chinese women. The main factors contributing to earlier onset of menopause and severity of menopausal symptoms were lower educational level, poor economic status, and smoking.

Loss of estrogens during menopause and administration of hormone therapy have both been hypothesized as sources of individual variation in the prevalence of cortical and subcortical atrophy and loss of cognitive function in late adulthood. In this review we critically summarize and assess the extant rodent and human neuroimaging studies that examine the link between estrogens and hippocampal morphology and function and focus predominantly on human studies of the hippocampus in postmenopausal women. Several cross-sectional studies report that the size of the hippocampus is larger in women receiving hormone therapy while several other cross-sectional studies report either negligible effects or smaller volumes in women receiving hormone therapy. We suggest that these differences might be caused by the variation between studies in the age of the samples studied, the duration of therapy, and the age at which hormone therapy is initiated. Unfortunately, all of the human studies reviewed here are cross-sectional in nature. With the lack of well-controlled randomized trials with neuroimaging measures on postmenopausal women both before and after some exposure interval, the effect of hormone therapy on hippocampal atrophy will remain equivocal and poorly understood.",

Ultimately, the muscle wasting and weakness may dramatically impact on mobility and the quality of life, where the elderly has increasing problems with performing activities of daily life, such as rising from a chair or climbing stairs. The rate of structural and functional deterioration of muscle appears to vary considerably between people. Part of the variation in the \u2018rate of muscle ageing\u2019 is attributable to genetic factors, the timing of changes in circulating hormones and the presence or absence of chronic low-grade systemic inflammation. Where an individual cannot change much in his or her genetic constitution, circulating hormones and systemic inflammation, (s)he can still significantly slow the rate of muscle ageing by an adequate dietary intake and regular physical activity.

We propose herein a review about the advantages and the inconvenients of individualized screening. The latter could be a more efficient strategy. The principles of individualized screening are (a) to start from the age at which the breast cancer risk is equal to that for an average women aged 50 years, (b) to stop when the risk of co-mortality exceeds the risk of breast cancer mortality, (c) to adapt the exams frequency and the imaging modalities to the individual risk and to the breast density, (d) to reassess regularly and individually the screening strategy, and (e) to discuss honestly with each woman in order to help her to decide if she participates or not.",

Despite increased awareness among physicians and the public, celiac disease is still markedly under-diagnosed at all ages, including the elderly. Although serological screening is now widely used, celiac disease remains a biopsy-defined disorder, and a critical element to the correct diagnosis is documentation of a response to a gluten-free diet (since it is a gluten-sensitive disease). Sometimes, after the diagnosis has been established with a treatment response, changes re-appear and seem resistant to a gluten-free diet. Usually, poor or limited diet compliance, possibly from an unrecognized gluten source is responsible. In others, another superimposed cause, such as an infectious agent, could be important. Finally, another associated disease causing similar clinical and biopsy features or, alternatively, a complicating disorder may develop, such as a lymphoma. Some with biopsy features suggestive of celiac disease may not respond to a gluten-free diet. These may not have celiac disease at all, but instead, a sprue-like intestinal disease, or so-called unclassified sprue.",

In addition, presence of plaque was an independent risk factor for a faster decline of eGFR.Cross-sectional analysis demonstrates that renal function declines with increasing age. However, 43% of participants did not experience a decline in eGFR during follow-up. Besides older age and higher initial eGFR, presence of atherosclerotic carotid plaque, higher SBP, higher LDL-C and lower TRF are independent risk factors to predict a rapid decline of renal function in the healthy Chinese population.",

     "abstract": "The intensified treatment of breast cancer improves survival but has a price in terms of side-effects. The main side-effects, such as vasomotor symptoms and impaired sexual functioning, are related to premature menopause due to chemotherapy and/or anti-hormonal therapy. Though for some women these symptoms are bearable, for others they have a large impact on their quality of life. The paper discusses the menopausal symptoms most frequently reported by breast cancer survivors and current treatment options.A literature review is presented of menopausal symptoms after breast cancer and management strategies, illustrated by two cases.Vasomotor symptoms can be relieved by lifestyle adaptation, acupuncture and non-hormonal agents such as venlafaxine, gabapentin or clonidine. Impaired sexual functioning can be treated by couple-based sexual counselling or psycho-educational therapy. Painful intercourse due to vaginal dryness can be alleviated by vaginal lubricants and moisturizers, but is most effectively treated by vaginal estriol. Local estriol seems safe if used for a short period (less than six weeks). Because of proven increased risk of recurrence with hormone replacement therapy (HRT), it should not be prescribed for breast cancer survivors, although exceptions could be made of selected cases of fully informed BRCA mutation carriers after ER-negative breast cancer and with severe menopausal symptoms due to prophylactic oophorectomy at a young age and (preferably) after mastectomy.The management of vasomotor symptoms and impaired sexual functioning in breast cancer survivors should focus on lifestyle and, if necessary, non-hormonal pharmacological interventions.",

     "abstract": "Treatments for osteoporosis over the last few decades have largely focused on antiresorptive agents that effectively prevent bone loss.

Teriparatide and PTH 1\u201384 are the only approved anabolic agents to date that primarily build new bone density. A variety of new biologic agents that focus on molecular targets important for the stimulation of new bone formation are being developed. Cathepsin K inhibitors appear to have mixed antiresorptive and anabolic actions because they inhibit one of the major osteoclast digestive enzymes without suppressing bone formation, thereby leading to anabolic effects on bone. New biologic agents in clinical trials include anti-sclerostin and anti-dickkopf antibodies that stimulate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway in osteoblasts, leading to new bone formation. These new agents will effectively stimulate new bone formation by different mechanisms, leading to improved bone mineral density and reduced fractures.",

     "abstract": "Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a disorder usually affecting middle aged women, who complain of diffuse musculoskeletal aches, pains or stiffness associated with tiredness, anxiety and poor sleep. Neurotransmission disorders linked both to pain perception as well as mood, sleep and cognition modulation are involved in FMS etiopathogenesys. Treatments that may be effective to decrease pain and fatigue include tricyclic antidepressants, dual reuptake inhibitors of serotonin/noradrenalin and pregabalin. The climacteric syndrome is a set of symptoms caused by the decline of ovarian hormone levels, which alters brain neurotransmission and provokes musculoskeletal pains, mood disorders, poor sleep quality and hot flushes. The hormone therapy reverses those symptoms and its risks are marginal if women's own hormones are used through transdermal route. Some antidepressants may be useful for patients with climacteric symptoms. We have found it surprising the epidemiological, etiopathogenic, symptomatic and therapeutic similarity between FMS and climacteric that could lead us to hypothesize that FMS is a part of the climacteric syndrome. However, the existence of FMS non-climacteric patients points out that hormone deficit is not the only physiopathological mechanism involved in this syndrome's etiopathogenesys. Nevertheless, it is likely that hormone disorders are involved in the symptoms genesis of most middle aged women with FMS. Keeping this in mind, we see the point in considering the use of HT in climacteric patients with FMS. Studies assessing the FMS clinical response to HT in a prospective manner and with the current diagnose criteria are still required.",

We included controlled studies in an ambulant setting that analyzed telemedicine interventions involving patients aged \u226560 years. 1585 articles matched the specified search criteria, thereof, 68 could be included in the review.Applications address an array of mostly frequent diseases, e.g. cardiovascular disease (N\u00a0=\u00a037) or diabetes (N\u00a0=\u00a018). The majority of patients is still living at home and is able to handle the telemedicine devices by themselves. In 59 of 68 articles (87%), the intervention can be categorized as monitoring. The largest proportion of telemedicine interventions consisted of measurements of vital signs combined with personal interaction between healthcare provider and patient (N\u00a0=\u00a024), and concepts with only personal interaction (telephone or videoconferencing, N\u00a0=\u00a014).The studies show predominantly positive results with a clear trend towards better results for \u201cbehavioral\u201d endpoints, e.g. adherence to medication or diet, and self-efficacy compared to results for medical outcomes (e.g. blood pressure, or mortality), quality of life, and economic outcomes (e.g. costs or hospitalization).However, in 26 of 68 included studies, patients with characteristic limitations for older patients (e.g. cognitive and visual impairment, communication barriers, hearing problems) were excluded.A considerable number of projects use rather sophisticated technology (e.g. videoconferencing), limiting ready translation into routine care.

In terms of human maturation, physically and cognitively functional centenarians certainly represent an impressive example of successful healthy ageing. However, even in these unique individuals, with the passage of time, declining lung function and sarcopenia lead to a progressive fall in maximal strength, maximal oxygen uptake, and therefore reduced exercise capacity. The subsequent mobility limitation can initiate a viscous downward spiral of reduced physical function and health. Emerging literature has shed some light on this multi-factorial decline in function associated with aging and the positive role that exercise and physical capacity can play in the elderly. Recognizing the multiple factors that influence ageing, the aim of this review is to highlight the recently elucidated limitations to physical function of the extremely old and therefore evaluate the role of exercise capacity in the health and longevity of centenarians.",

The purpose of this article is to provide policy makers with an improved understanding of the sex-specific and gender dimensions that exist to help formulate more effective and targeted health and social care policies.The findings, from which this article is formed, were reported in the form of an evidence review which included both qualitative and quantitative studies from academic, clinical, research and grey literature. The issue of dementia was approached through the prism of sex and gender, in an attempt to understand the complex interaction between biologically and socially constructed roles.There continues to be a pressing need to raise awareness of the impact of discrimination, exclusion and stigma associated with dementia and the impact for women in particular.While the \u2018feminisation of ageing\u2019 is a widely recognised trend, hitherto a comprehensive approach to the impact of dementia on women remains largely unexplored with regards to research and policy impact. Women face a \u2018triple jeopardy\u2019 as a result of the associated stigma attached to their age, gender and decline in cognitive functions.The need for further research of the sex and gender specific risk factors for dementia is highlighted alongside the need for greater evidence on diagnosis, treatment and response.The findings also expose the gender specific nature of unpaid care and the associated consequences for women as a result.Based on analysis of the available data and assisted by the gender lens tool, the findings presented in this article posit that women across many parts of the world are and will continue to disproportionately bear the burden of dementia, with particular regard to either living with dementia and/or caring for family members with dementia.",

The number of breast cancer survivors has increased due to screening and improved treatment methods, which makes it important to increase knowledge on their health and well-being. Physical activity has been reported to improve quality of life, decrease fatigue and reduce all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality in breast cancer survivors. The beneficial effects of physical activity may manifest themselves in circulating levels of insulin, insulin-growth factors (IGFs) I and II and their binding proteins (IGFBPs), or inflammatory biomarkers. The aim of this report was to review available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of physical activity on biomarkers in breast cancer survivors. We identified 12 publications based on nine RCTs that fulfilled our inclusion criteria published until 19th June 2012. The RCTs were small (16\u2013101 breast cancer survivors); mean BMI was \u226525 and the mean age in 8 out of 9 RCTs was approximately 50 years. Five RCTs reported statistically significant effects of physical activity on insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 in breast cancer survivors, but the results were not consistent. None of four RCTs found any evidence for a role of investigated interleukines. One trial reported some evidence that exercise may decrease C-reactive protein levels. In conclusion, available RCTs have produced some evidence that physical activity may result in beneficial changes in levels of insulin, IGFs, IGFBPs, and inflammatory biomarkers in breast cancer survivors. However, further larger RCTs on physical activity and biomarkers in breast cancer survivors are warranted.",

Men with the MTHFR TT homozygosity had significantly higher tHcy concentration than those with the CC genotype (mean difference of 1.38\u00a0\u03bcmol/l, 95% CI 0.77\u20131.99). However, there was no apparent association between the MTHFR polymorphism and PCS.Elevated tHcy is associated with poorer self-perceived physical health in community-dwelling older men. The results of this study support further longitudinal investigations to assess this relationship prospectively.",

Engineered nanoparticles have the potential to revolutionize the diagnosis and the therapy of several diseases, particularly by targeted delivery of anticancer drugs and imaging contrast agents. Prostate cancer, the second most common cancer in men, represents one of the major epidemiological problems, especially for patients in the advanced age. There is a substantial interest in developing therapeutic options for treatment of prostate cancer based on use of nanodevices, to overcome the lack of specificity of conventional chemotherapeutic agents as well as for the early detection of precancerous and malignant lesions. Herein, we highlight on the recent development of nanotechnology strategies adopted for the management of prostate cancer. In particular, the combination of targeted and controlled-release polymer nanotechnologies has recently resulted in the clinical development of BIND-014, a promising targeted Docetaxel-loaded nanoprototype, which can be validated for use in the prostate cancer therapy. However, several limitations facing nanoparticle delivery to solid tumours, such as heterogeneity of intratumoural barriers and vasculature, cytotoxicity and/or hypersensitivity reactions to currently available cancer nanomedicines, and the difficult in developing targeted nanoparticles with optimal biophysicochemical properties, should be still addressed for a successful tumour eradication.",

The conceptual basis, which actually dates back a number of decades, resides in physical (magnetic) enhancement, with magnetic field gradients aligned non-parallel to the direction of flow in the tumor vasculature, of existing passive mechanisms for extravasation and accumulation of MNP in the tumor interstitial fluid, followed by MNP internalization.

     "abstract": "Nowadays diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes (which is strongly related to the Western diet and life-style), has developed worldwide into an epidemic disease. Nanomedicine aims to provide novel tools for diagnosis, therapy and point-of-care management of patients.Several nanotechnological approaches were developed to improve life quality for patients with insulin-dependent diabetes. They facilitate blood glucose management by non-invasive glucose measurement as well as insulin administration mainly by delivering the fragile protein as protected and targeted formulation via nasal or oral route.In the present review the oral or nasal insulin delivery by polymeric nanoparticles is discussed with focus on physiological change either related to the disease, diabetes or age-related metabolic variations influencing insulin release and bioavailability. One critical point is that new generations of targeted nanoparticle based drugs are developed and optimized for certain metabolic conditions. These conditions may change with age or disease. The influence of age-related factors such as immaturity in very young age, metabolic and physiologic changes in old age or insufficient animal models are still under-investigated not only in nanomedicine but also generally in pharmacology.Summarizing it can be noted that the bioavailability of insulin administered via routes others than subcutaneously is comparably low (max. 60%). Moreover factors like changed gut permeability as described for diabetes type 1 or other metabolic peculiarities such as insulin resistance in case of type 2 diabetes also play a role in affecting the development of novel nanoparticulated drug preparations and can be responsible for unsuccessful translation of promising animal results into human therapy.In future insulin nanoparticle development for diabetes must consider not only requirements imposed by the drug but also metabolic changes inflicted by disease or by age. Moreover new approaches are required for prevention of the disease.",

     "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) are prevalent chronic health conditions. However, despite recent advances in medical therapeutics, their treatment still represents an unmet medical need because of safety and efficacy concerns with currently prescribed drugs. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop and test new drugs for RA and OA that selectively target inflamed joints thereby mitigating damage to healthy tissues.Conceivably, biocompatible, biodegradable, disease-modifying antirheumatic nanomedicines (DMARNs) could represent a promising therapeutic approach for RA and OA. To this end, the unique physicochemical properties of drug-loaded nanocarriers coupled with pathophysiological characteristics of inflamed joints amplify bioavailability and bioactivity of DMARNs and promote their selective targeting to inflamed joints. This, in turn, minimizes the amount of drug required to control articular inflammation and circumvents collateral damage to healthy tissues. Thus, nanomedicine could provide selective control both in space and time of the inflammatory process in affected joints.However, bringing safe and efficacious DMARNs for RA and OA to the marketplace is challenging because regulatory agencies have no official definition of nanotechnology, and rules and definitions for nanomedicines are still being developed. Although existing toxicology tests may be adequate for most DMARNs, as new toxicity risks and adverse health effects derived from novel nanomaterials with intended use in humans are identified, additional toxicology tests would be required. Hence, we propose that detailed pre-clinical in vivo safety assessment of promising DMARNs leads for RA and OA, including risks to the general population, must be conducted before clinical trials begin.",

     "abstract": "Nanomedicine is an emerging technology and the first nano-engineered medical products have come to light in the last decade. Transdermal drug delivery has significant advantages compared to other routes of drug administration. Nanoparticles unique physical and chemical properties enable transport of substances directly into the skin. The objective of this paper is to review different aspects of nanoparticle delivery, generally, and discuss its current use for transdermal hormone therapy. Transdermal estrogen therapy remains the most effective treatment for bothersome menopausal symptoms, particularly in those women for whom the potential adverse effects associated with \u201cfirst pass\u201d hepatic metabolism are to be avoided. Available alternatives for transdermal estrogen delivery include patches, gels, sprays and lotions. Other non-oral therapies which likewise avoid \u201cfirst pass\u201d hepatic metabolism include: subcutaneous implants and vaginal rings. Some of the transdermal products are associated with mild adverse skin effects such as redness and irritation, but more severe and bothersome consequences include blistering and tattooing. Even the mild adverse skin effects are frequently cited as reasons for discontinuation. Micellar nanoparticle estradiol emulsion (MNPEE) is a lotion-like therapy which constitutes an alternative transdermal delivery system not requiring the permeation enhancers or temporary skin digestion, both of which increase the possibility of irritation. MNPEE's advantages include low fluctuation of plasma estradiol concentrations, infrequent skin related adverse effects, and pleasant cosmetic-like moisturizing properties. The efficacy of MNPEE for management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms has been demonstrated in a randomized placebo controlled trial [1], and the product is FDA approved for management of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms. None of the observed adverse effects in the MNPEE group were statistically different from the placebo group [1]. Studies addressing inadvertent transference of estradiol to the male partners of menopausal women using this delivery technology have demonstrated small, but real amounts of transference, which do not exceed the normal physiological male estradiol range. MNPEE is safe and effective for treatment of vasomotor symptoms and represents the commercial validation of nanoparticle technology for transdermal delivery of estrogen therapy (ET) for postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms.",

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disease of the prostate affecting men as they age, and a risk factor for developing prostate cancer. Lycopene is a member of the carotenoid family, whose strong anti-oxidant properties have been hypothesised to assist in the prevention and treatment of BPH and prostate cancer. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of lycopene for the prevention and treatment of BPH and prostate cancer.A search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine) and the Cochrane Library databases was performed for published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing lycopene to placebo (or other interventions) for the treatment of BPH and prostate cancer. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool.Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria for this systematic review. All included studies were heterogeneous with respect to their design and implementation of lycopene. Methodological quality of three studies was assessed as posing a \u2018high\u2019 risk of bias, two a \u2018low\u2019 risk of bias and the remaining three an \u2018unclear\u2019 risk of bias.

Comparisons were made between healthy controls versus cervical cancer survivors, survivors before versus after treatment and between different treatment modalities.Twenty studies were included. Most studies showed no differences in the ability to achieve an orgasm. Cervical cancer survivors reported more dyspareunia than healthy controls and dyspareunia was more frequent and lasted longer after radiotherapy. Lack of lubrication was more frequent in cervical cancer survivors and a significant decrease in sexual interest and activity after treatment was found.Cervical cancer survivors are at risk for sexual pain disorders, while sexual satisfaction (orgasm) is not impaired and radiotherapy negatively influenced sexual pain disorders. Health care providers should inform cervical cancer survivors about the possible risk of developing sexual pain disorders after cervical cancer treatment, especially after radiotherapy. As sexual satisfaction per se is not impaired, we suggest that prevention and treatment of sexual dysfunction should focus on painless and satisfactory sex instead of on resuming intercourse.",

In this updated report we added the BC data from incidence years 2007 and 2008.We used European standardized incidence rates for invasive BC in the age class 50\u201369 years for Flanders (1999\u20132008), Brussels and Wallonia (2004\u20132008), obtained from IMS Health HRT sales data (1997\u20132008) for Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia. The association between BC incidence and HRT use was analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE) in order to take into consideration the dependency between the subsequent data points.There was a significant association between the invasive BC incidence rate and estimated rate of HRT users in the previous year: p-value\u00a0<\u00a00.001.Although this study is hampered by a number of limitations, these data support the idea that the drop in BC incidence can be partly attributed to the decrease in HRT use. Since HRT remains the most used medication for climacteric symptoms, we encourage the creation of a prospective registry in Europe, collecting detailed data in various European countries, in order to assess the adjusted increase in BC risk associated with HRT, which may be population and regimen dependent.",

Since the vast majority of menopausal symptoms\u2019 severity was significantly influenced by the way women perceived their recent life events, it is concluded that the symptomatology exacerbation, in peri- and post-menopausal women, might be due to life conditions and events, rather than hormonal changes (nonetheless, the inverse influence should be investigated in future studies). Therefore, these should be accounted for in menopause-related clinical and research settings.",

Quadriceps muscle strength and SPPB total score increased significantly in both groups and SPPB balance subscale score increased only in IM group. Six patients (9.6%) developed hypercalciuria, no significant adverse events were observed.In vitamin D deficient/insufficient elderly, a single megadose of cholecalciferol increased vitamin D levels significantly and the majority of the patients reached optimal levels.

Smoking and menopausal status were assessed by self-report. Other covariates were measured prospectively in the previous follow-ups.This study is based on 3545 women who provided data on their menopausal status at the 21-year follow-up of the study, and prospective as well as concurrent data on smoking. In univariate analysis tobacco smoking during the reproductive life course, socio-economic status and gravidity were significantly associated with earlier age of menopause. In multivariate analyses women who smoked cigarettes were more likely to experience earlier menopause than non-smokers. Compared to current smokers, risk of early menopause was significantly lower in those women who quit smoking in the past.The data suggest that the impact of smoking is independent of other covariates associated with both smoking and age of menopause. The findings raise the possibility that effective quit smoking interventions may lead to a later age of menopause, and reduce the risk of adverse health consequences of early menopause.",

This study was designed to compare the uterotrophic effects of a new estrogen vaginal formulation (0.005% estriol vaginal gel) and other existing topical treatments (Ovestinon\u00ae and Colpotrofin\u00ae).Each one of the studied formulations was administered intravaginally to groups of ovariectomized rats with cytologically confirmed vaginal atrophy. The doses were adjusted by animal weight according to human dosage. After daily treatment for 14\u00a0days, the animals were sacrificed and their vaginas and uteri removed. All uteri were weighted. Uteri and vaginas were fixed for histological evaluation.All three active formulations proved to be very effective in the cytological reversal of vaginal atrophy. However, they differ in their effects in the uteri. Ovestinon\u00ae and Colpotrofin\u00ae produced a significant increase in uterine weight, myometrial and endometrial thickness as well as histological modifications in the endometrium suggestive of estrogenic activity. Conversely, animals treated with 0.005% estriol vaginal gel, did not show significant weight increase or any other macroscopical or microcospical modifications of the uteri, an effect comparable to placebo.There are significant differences in the uterotrophic effect of three different topical estrogen formulations as tested in a rat model of vaginal postmenopausal atrophy. While the three formulations were equally effective in reversing vaginal atrophy, only the newly developed ultra-low dose 0.005% estriol vaginal gel has proved to lack any significant estrogenic effect on the uterus.",

Assessment of determinants capable of influencing the prevalence of insomnia and poor sleep quality was also performed.A total of 6079 women aged 40\u201359 of 11 Latin American countries were invited to fill out the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Goldberg Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), the Brief Scale of Abnormal Drinking and a general socio-demographic questionnaire.Overall, 56.6% of surveyed women suffered of either insomnia, poor sleep quality, or both. Specifically, 43.6% and 46.2% presented insomnia and poor sleep quality in accordance to the AIS and the PSQI respectively. The prevalence of insomnia increased with female age (from 39.7% in those aged 40\u201344 to 45.2% in those aged 55\u201359, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and menopausal stage (from 39.5% in premenopausal aged 40\u201344 to 46.3% in late postmenopausal ones, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). \u201cAwakening during the night\u201d (AIS: Item 2) was the most highly rated of all items and contributing in a higher degree (mean 16%) to the total score of the scale in all menopausal phases. Sleep quality also worsened with age and menopausal status, impairment particularly affecting sleep efficiency and latency and the increased use of hypnotics. Vasomotor symptoms (VMS), depressive mood and anxiety were associated to sleep disturbances. Women presenting sleep disturbances displayed a 2-fold increase in the severity of menopausal symptoms (higher total MRS scores) which was translated into a 6\u20138 times higher risk of impaired quality of life. Logistic regression analysis determined that female age, the presence of chronic disease, troublesome drinking, anxiety, depression, VMS, drug use (hypnotics and hormone therapy) were significant risk factors related to the presence of sleep disturbances. Higher educational level related to less insomnia and better sleep quality.Insomnia and poor sleep quality were highly prevalent in this mid-aged female sample in which the influence of age and the menopause was only modest and rather linked to menopausal symptoms already occurring since the premenopause.",

     "abstract": "We conducted a systematic review investigating body fat distribution in older adults and its association with morbidity and mortality. Our search yielded 2702 citations. Following three levels of screening, 25 studies were selected to evaluate the association between body fat distribution and comorbidity, and 17 studies were used in the mortality analysis. Most of the selected studies in our analyses used anthropometric measures, e.g., body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and waist\u2013hip ratio; relatively few studies used direct measures, such as body fat/lean mass, and percentage body fat. Studies reported inconsistent findings regarding the strongest predictor(s) of morbidity and mortality. However, the majority of studies suggested that BMI per se was not the most appropriate predictor of morbidity and mortality in the elderly because of its inability to discern or detect age-related body fat redistribution. In addition, studies using BMI found that the optimal BMI range for the lowest mortality in the elderly was overweight (25\u00a0kg/m2\u00a0\u2264\u00a0BMI\u00a0<\u00a030\u00a0kg/m2) or mildly obese (30\u00a0kg/m2\u00a0\u2264\u00a0BMI\u00a0<\u00a035\u00a0kg/m2). Our findings suggest that the current clinical guidelines, recommending that overweight and obesity are major risk factors for increased morbidity and mortality are not applicable to this population. Therefore, the central message of this review is to advise the government to establish new guidelines specifically for this population, using a combination of body fat distribution measurements, and to certify that these guidelines will not be applied to inappropriate populations.",

The relationship between peri-operative haemoglobin levels and outcome after hip fracture surgery are controversial. We assessed whether higher haemoglobin levels predict length of hospital stay after hip fracture surgery in elderly subjects.A follow-up study in a historical cohort was performed in 317 patients aged 65 years old undergoing hip fracture surgery over the period 2004\u20132006 at the Leiden University Medical Centre.Linear regression analysis was used to assess the association between pre- and post-operative haemoglobin level and length of hospital stay after controlling for age and sex.Anaemia after hip fracture surgery was present among 86% of the patients. Length of hospital stay after hip fracture surgery in elderly subjects with post-operative anaemia (10.7 days) was significantly longer than in elderly subjects without post-operative anaemia (7.5 days, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Post-operative haemoglobin levels and length of hospital stay were inversely related (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). The length of hospital stay was not related with pre-operative haemoglobin level.Higher postoperative haemoglobin levels predict shorter length of hospital stay after hip fracture surgery in the elderly. A definitive randomized clinical trial has to demonstrate whether this association is causal.",

     "abstract": "This paper sheds light on the dynamic relationship between people's experiences of low income and the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) by moving beyond the static perspective provided by cross-sectional studies to a long-term approach informed by longitudinal analyses. Methods: We analyzed data from the Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) conducted by Statistics Canada from 1994 to 2007. The longitudinal sample is composed of 17,276 respondents (8046 males, 9230 females) 12 years of age or older. We further developed an algorithm to distinguish T2DM from other types of diabetes. Proportional hazard models with time-varying predictors were used to explore the dynamics of the relationship between low income and T2DM. Results: The results suggest that living in low income and experiencing persistent low income are significant precursors of developing T2DM. Being in low income in the previous cycle of T2DM onset was associated with 77% higher risk of T2DM (hazard ratio 1.77; 95% CI: 1.48\u20132.12). The association between low income and diabetes incidence remains significant after adjusting for age, sex, health behaviors, and psychological distress (hazard ratio 1.24; 95% CI: 1.02\u20131.52). Conclusion: This study contributes to the under-developed research examining longitudinally the relationship between socioeconomic status and diabetes incidence. Employing this long-term approach, this study calls attention to the primary effect of socioeconomic position on diabetes incidence that cannot be explained entirely by behavioral factors. Findings draw attention to the need to address the role played in T2DM by the inequitable distribution of the social determinants of health.",

This study explores how these women experienced a Group Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) intervention to help them manage their treatment-related HF/NS. The study was conducted as part of a randomised control trial/RCT (MENOS 1) evaluating the intervention among this target group.In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty trial participants to explore how they experienced the intervention and its effects. The interviews were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis.The analysis revealed four superordinate themes: Making sense of symptom change; new ways of coping and regaining control; tailoring the treatment to meet individual needs and resources; and valuing the group context, social support and social comparisons. All the women found Group CBT improved their ability to cope with their HF/NS, while also developing an appreciation of the role of psychological factors in their symptom experience. Through the knowledge and understanding acquired women developed a more accepting stance to their symptoms, as well as gaining a \u2018sense of control\u2019.The results are consistent with the main RCT outcomes which showed that Group CBT led to a clinically significant reduction in \u2018HF/NS problem rating\u2019 relative to \u2018treatment as usual\u2019, as well as improvements in mood and physical and social functioning.

Cardiovascular responsiveness was comprehensively assessed with controlled and deep breathing, active orthostatic test, Valsalva maneuver and handgrip test.Hot flushes were accompanied with a significant reduction (\u22122.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 vs. 1.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0beats/min, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) in resting heart rate during estradiol-only treatment; the route of estradiol administration was no factor in this regard. This effect was attenuated by the addition of MPA to oral estradiol. Hot flushes were also associated with reduced maximal heart rate in response to handgrip during the use of estradiol-only therapy (\u22122.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 vs. 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0beats/min, p\u00a0=\u00a00.038); again, the MPA addition eliminated this effect. Hot flushes were accompanied with lowered resting but augmented blood pressure responses to handgrip test during all hormone regimens, whereas in women without hot flushes estradiol-only regimen tended to elevate diastolic resting blood pressure.Hot flushes appear as determinants for cardiovascular responses to hormone therapy. Estradiol-only therapy causes beneficial changes in cardiovascular regulation in flushing women, and these are blunted, in part, by the addition of MPA.",

Gender differentials in financial resources can often result in a greater likelihood of facing poverty for older women compared to older men, and such risk can be experienced for longer periods for women, as a result of their higher life expectancy on average. For example, across the EU-27, 16% of men compared to 23% of women aged 65 and over faced a poverty risk, and at age 65, men can expect to live another 17 years on average, while women another 21 years.

DES appears to cause epigenetic effects in animals and there is some evidence that this also occurs in man. The mechanisms of carcinogenesis are complex and the effects are difficult to prove due to the background of dietary and environmental phyto- and xenooestrogens.

In this article, as well as addressing diagnosis and treatments, we focus mainly on peri-menopausal women who are equally (if not more) affected by this disorder and who are subjected to PMS via a host of widely used hormonal treatments. We describe the vicious cycle that exists between exogenous progestogen stimulating PMS-like symptoms and the progestogen that is required for endometrial protection and ways of avoiding this. The treatment should address all concerns of the individual, namely contraceptive requirements, control of PMS and menopausal symptoms. The main theory behind treatment of PMS is to suppress ovulation along the hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis, however neurotransmitters are also implicated in reducing sensitivity to progesterone via receptors, and therefore selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also useful. Surgical methods are strongly discouraged and are a last resort. With so many pitfalls, this article aims to tackle the issues commonly encountered with diagnosis and treatment of PMS in the peri-menopause.",

Many patients however, poorly adhere to prescribed supplements, so consistent monitoring is needed. Clinical monitoring usually ends with the discharge rendering the continuation of nutritional supplement therapy in the patient's home problematic. We developed a telemedicine based health care concept for intensive home monitoring. In a first randomized controlled prospective study we analyzed the feasibility of this innovative approach. The intervention group received oral nutritional supplements and telemedical monitoring with daily assessment of body weight, number of taken oral energy supplements and state of health. The control group received usual care. 13 patients were included in each group, eight patients of the intervention group left the study prematurely, five patients were closely monitored and used the devices for a mean 67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a063.5 days. Follow up data of body weight and BMI showed no relevant differences between both groups.The results and experiences gained in this pilot study demonstrate that telemedical systems provide encouraging new options to enable an intensive monitoring of malnourished patients.

Multiple linear regression analysis determined that lower total WYRS scores (less resilience) correlated with high altitude residency, more severe hot flushes, sedentarism, higher abdominal circumferences and having a partner with erectile dysfunction. Contrary to this, higher WYRS scores correlated with higher parity and sexual activity.As assessed with the WYRS tool, lower resilience of this mid-aged Ecuadorian female sample was related to various female and partner lifestyle and health issues, not necessarily related per se to the ageing process.

     "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to explore the potential value of questionnaires in routine clinical practice to assess female sexual dysfunction (FSD), and to identify if this could increase the competence of a physician in the initial management of women with these problems. The rationale to encourage Health Care Professionals (HCPs) to engage women in dialogue about their sexual health is that it may enhance a woman's quality of life (which may lead to improved general health) and might lead to timely interventions and possible preventative measures for certain diseases.A short literature review of the most relevant publications was undertaken evaluating current practice.FSD can have a negative impact on women's well-being and can also be an early symptom of underlying disease. Many HCPs do not broach the subject, consequently women do not get the opportunity either to voice their sexual concerns or access appropriate services. Review of currently available FSD questionnaires suggests that many but not all are generally inappropriate for use in routine clinical practice. Kriston et al.\u2019s [1] STEFFI-2 may be an appropriate starting point. Evidence suggests that this would facilitate discussion of sexual matters between the HCP and the women, and increase the likelihood of FSD being diagnosed.Following this review of the literature, the authors strongly recommend that HCPs include FSD questionnaires as part of their routine engagement with women. However, the questionnaire would need to be used as part of the overall assessment and cannot replace a detailed case history and examination, which should lead to effective treatment and management of FSD. The authors recommend further research in the following areas: \u2022 Effective training for HCPs. \u2022 FSD as an early presentation of sub-clinical disease. \u2022 The cost-benefit of early treatment of FSD. \u2022 A standardised, validated FSD screening tool. \u2022 Benefits of using FSD screener in routine clinical practice.",

This review used evidence-based methodology closely mirroring the FDA and EMEA guidelines as a template to identify \u201cwell-designed\u201d RCTs from which effective and clinically meaningful non-hormonal hot flash therapies could be identified. In addition, pertinent safety information was reviewed. Out of 3548 MEDLINE citations and abstracts, 51 well-designed hot flash RCTs were identified. From these trials, gabapentin, oxybutynin ER, desvenlafaxine, soy-derived isoflavones and black cohosh each showed a clinically meaningful treatment effect in at least 1 RCT. Among these 5 compounds, only gabapentin demonstrated consistent and statistically significant benefit over placebo in all of its well-designed RCTs. Desvenlafaxine, soy-derived isoflavones, and black cohosh demonstrated statistically significant benefit over placebo in 75%, 21%, and 17% of the well-designed RCTs for each compound, respectively. There was only 1 well-designed RCT using oxybutynin ER, which showed it to have a robust and clinically meaningful benefit. In terms of safety, there have been cardiovascular risks associated with desvenlafaxine use in postmenopausal women with hot flashes. The use of anticonvulsants, in general, has been associated with an absolute 0.21% increase in suicidal thoughts and behavior. Further research is needed with several of these nonhormonal compounds to replicate these findings and to also directly compare their efficacy and tolerability with those of hormone replacement therapy.",

A structured search using MeSH-vocabulary and Title/Abstract-searches was conducted in PubMed for January 2000 to June 2011, identifying weight gain and exercise or physical activity as study topics, and aged adults as target group. In study selection, all types of exercise and physical activity and any measure of weight change in aged adults (\u226565 years) or postmenopausal women were considered. N\u00a0=\u00a09 primary studies were identified. All were conducted in the US, with one study additionally including samples from Canada and the UK. Three studies focused on aged adults, while six concentrated specifically on postmenopausal women. Forms of exercise or physical activity comprised self-reported exercise history in four studies and low, moderate or high intensity exercise interventions in five studies. Four studies combined exercise with a hypocaloric diet and included comparison groups receiving either diet only, health education, stretching or a delayed intervention (one study each). Exercise was associated with weight loss (1.1\u20136\u00a0kg) in all intervention studies, all of which studied an overweight sample, and with weight maintenance in most observational studies, all of which studied a general population or otherwise overweight-unspecific sample. In sum, exercise and physical activity can effectively prevent weight gain in older adults and postmenopausal women either in terms of weight loss or maintenance. They can preserve lean body mass and thus are important for the balance between potentially positive and negative effects of weight reduction in later life. In addition, since all intervention studies were conducted with an overweight sample, it seems that primordial prevention (in terms of preventing the development of risk factors such as excess weight in the first place) might be a neglected issue in geriatric and postmenopausal prevention.",

The objective of this review is to describe the contributions of the Newcastle Thousand Families Study in understanding the relative impacts of factors in early life, particularly birth weight and socio-economic position at birth, in influencing health in later life.The Newcastle Thousand Families Study is a prospective birth cohort established in 1947. It originally included all births to mothers resident in Newcastle upon Tyne, in northern England, in May and June of that year. Study members were followed extensively throughout childhood and intermittently in adulthood. At the age of 49\u201351 years, study members underwent a large-scale follow-up phase enabling an assessment of how early life may influence their later health, and also incorporating adult risk factors which enabled the relative contributions of factors at different stages of life to be assessed.While some findings from the study do support birth weight and early socio-economic position having influences on adult health status, the associations are generally small when compared to risk factors later in life. Using path analyses on longitudinal data of this nature enables mediating pathways between early life and later health to be assessed and if more studies were to take this approach, the relative importance of early life on adult disease risk could be better understood.",

So, dietary changes should be part of the holistic approach which includes improvements in the regulation of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and hyperglycaemia. In the present review, we try to provide a global approach on how diet can influence the risk of stroke and especially the nutritional influence on lipid profile and vessel disease and the role of dietary modification in the secondary stroke prevention.

Diagnosis is the synthesis of a bleeding history, family history and specialised laboratory tests. Women with IBDs are more likely to suffer HMB, to be symptomatic, and to present with bleeding in association with gynaecological problems. Heavy and/or abnormal menstrual bleeding increases with age due increased anovulatory cycles and gynaecological pathologies in older women. Thus, older women with IBDs are more likely to present with gynaecological bleeding symptoms, have impaired QOL and require surgical interventions. Treatment with specific clotting factor concentrates may be required and this requires an expert in haematology. Awareness of IBDs among health care providers, early diagnosis and appropriate management in a multidisciplinary approach is required to minimise the bleeding complications for women with IBDs.",

The other studies were using a non-surgical treatment control group. Further possible bias may be caused by manufacturer involvement in financing of three published RCT.There is level Ib evidence that vertebroplasty is no better than placebo, which is conflicting with the available level IIb evidence that there is a positive short-term effect of cement augmentation compared to standard medical therapy with regard to QoL, function and pain. Kyphoplasty is not superior to vertebroplasty with regard to pain, but with regard to VCF reduction (evidence level IIb). Kyphoplasty is probably not cost-effective (evidence level IIb), and vertebroplasty has not more than short-term cost-effectiveness (evidence level IV).Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty cannot be recommended as standard treatment for osteoporotic VCF. Ongoing sham-controlled trials may provide further evidence in this regard.",

However, it has a dose-dependent effect on cell death, even on some cancer cells.Our aim was to investigate this dose-dependent effect on human bladder carcinoma ECV304 cells during oxidative stress condition.For this purpose, ECV304 cells incubated with different Resveratrol concentrations were analyzed as for their metabolic rate, membrane permeability, DNA fragmentation, anti/proapoptotic protein levels and phosphatidylserine exposure after oxidative stress.Resveratrol induced cell death at high concentrations (>20\u00a0\u03bcM), but not at low ones (0.1\u201320\u00a0\u03bcM). Pretreatment with 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM protected the cells from oxidative damage, whereas 50\u00a0\u03bcM intensified the cell death and significantly increased Bad/Bcl-2 ratio (proapoptotic/antiapoptotic proteins). Resveratrol was able to modulate NO and PGE2 secretion and performed an anti-adhesion activity of neutrophils on PMA-activated ECV304 cells.Resveratrol at high doses induces cell death of ECV304 cells whereas low doses induce protection. Modulation of Bcl-2 protein induced by Resveratrol could be mediating this effect. This information about the role of Resveratrol on cancer alerts us about its dose-dependent effects and could lead the design of future chemoprevention strategies.",

Also, an increase in APN and APB activities was observed, which support a role for angiotensin IV (Ang IV). In women treated with a neoadjuvant therapy, we described an increase in ASAP and APA activities, supporting the idea that this treatment increases Ang II catabolism. The resulting decrease in Ang II level could lead to an inhibition of the tumour growth.Present results show changes in serum angiotensinase activities in women with breast cancer and in women with breast cancer treated with a neoadjuvant therapy of paclitaxel and anthracycline.

Internal consistency of each tool was also computed.Median [interquartile range] age of the sample was 51 [9.0] years. A 55.5% were postmenopausal, 47.3% had increased body mass index (BMI) values, 57.7% were abdominally obese, 1.6% had hypertension and 86.3% had a stable partner. In addition, 4.9% used hormone therapy and 19.2% psychotropic drugs. Multiple linear regression analysis found that higher UCLA-LS scores (more loneliness) correlated with MRS psychological scores, partner alcohol abuse, living in urban areas, lower LSI-A scores (less life satisfaction) and not having a stable partner. Lower LSI-A scores (worse life satisfaction) correlated with severe female economical problems, BMI values and UCLA-LS and MRS psychological scores.Loneliness and life satisfaction in this mid-aged female sample was influenced by personal and partner issues which seem to play a much more relevant role than biological aspects. More research is warranted in this regard.",

This protective effect on endothelium seems to be mediated by endogenous estrogen, which preserves nitric oxide availability by activating the l-arginine-NO pathway in normotensive women and by inhibiting reactive oxygen species generation.Whether endogenous androgen may modulate endothelial function and the mechanisms involved are still unsolved issues, since data concerning the effect of testosterone on endothelium are scanty and contradictory.",

One established that serum creatinine at baseline is a significant predictor of the presence of SCI; the other that the presence of SCI at baseline is a significant predictor of a decrease in GFR.The results from this review show that CKD is associated with brain lesions. These brain lesions include WML, SCI and brain atrophy. This finding is of clinical importance because these brain lesions are predictive of stroke, cognitive decline and dementia. Additional follow up studies should be performed to better understand the causative pathway and to establish whether screening and preventive programs are beneficial.",

     "abstract": "Dienogest (DNG) is a 19-nortestosterone derivative (a C-19 progestogen) with a cyanomethyl instead of an ethinyl group at the C-17 position, which may make the compound elicit fewer hepatic effects than other C-19 nortestosterone derivatives. Its similarity to norethisterone is reflected in its high endometrial efficacy, which could explain the high stability of the menstrual cycle women achieve when they use DNG in combination with ethinyl estradiol (EE) or with estradiol valerate (E2V). Its strong endometrial efficacy underlies the use of DNG (on its own) to treat endometriosis, and gives it antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects in the treatment of endometriotic lesions. Properties derived from its C-19 derivative structure include its short plasma half-life, of about 10\u00a0h (which means the drug is not accumulated), and its high oral bioavailability, of more than 90%. However, DNG also has some of the properties of typical of progesterone derivatives, including a lack of effect on the metabolic and cardiovascular systems, and considerable antiandrogenic activity, the latter increased by its lack of affinity to the sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), in contrast to other C-19 progestogens.DNG has no glucocorticoid and no antimineralocorticoid activity. It also has no antiestrogenic activity, which suggests that it should not antagonize estradiol's beneficial effects. This is important for its use in the treatment of endometriosis, because, due to DNG's low gonadotropic activity, E2 levels are not decreased to zero, in contrast to treatments with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues. This maintenance beneficial E2 effects is of particular importance for the general tolerability of the first contraceptive pill to use E2V instead of EE, although clinical endpoint studies are still ongoing. These studies are expected, on the basis of its pharmacology, to demonstrate the cardiovascular safety of the new pill.",

At dosages of 1.5\u00a0mg/day or more, NOMAC effectively suppresses gonadotropic activity and ovulation in women of reproductive age. Hemostasis, lipids and carbohydrate metabolism remain largely unchanged. In normal and cancerous human breast cells, NOMAC has shown favorable effects on estrogen metabolism. Like natural progesterone (but in contrast to some other synthetic progestogens), it does not appear stimulate the proliferation of cancerous breast cells.While there has been some experience of the use of NOMAC in combination with estrogens as a hormone replacement therapy, most of the data on the compound are reported in the context of its inclusion as a component of a new contraceptive pill comprising 2.5\u00a0mg NOMAC combined with 1.5\u00a0mg estradiol. Because of its strong endometrial efficacy, and due to its high antigonadotropic activity and long elimination half-life (about 50\u00a0h), the contraceptive efficacy of the new pill is maintained even when dosages are missed. Furthermore, for the first time with a monophasic 24/4 regimen containing estradiol, cyclical stability can be achieved comparable with that obtained using pills containing ethinyl estradiol and progestogens like levonorgestrel or drospirenone.The addition of NOMAC to estradiol means that the beneficial effects of estrogen are not lost, which is of especial importance in relation to the cardiovascular system. On the basis both of its pharmacology and of studies performed during the development of the NOMAC/estradiol pill, involving some 4000 women in total, good long-term tolerability can be expected for NOMAC, although its safety profile is still to be fully ascertained, as the clinical endpoint studies are yet to be completed.",

Thus, the decline in EPT use from 2002 to 2003 should have precipitated an increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer. We tested this prediction using the SEER 9 epidemiologic database.We analyzed WHI data concerning the effects of EPT and estrogen therapy (ET) on colorectal cancer risks. We also examined HT prescription sales data, as well as SEER 9 colorectal cancer incidences from 2001 to 2004.In the WHI study, the incidence of colorectal cancer was comparable in EPT placebo-users, ET users, and ET placebo-users, but significantly lower in EPT users. Assuming that 30% of eligible women used HT in 2001, the decline in EPT sales from 2002 to 2003 of 63% should have increased the incidence of colorectal cancer by 2.8% in the overall population at risk. However, the SEER 9 colorectal cancer incidence fell by 5.9% in this population, which is comparable to the 6.7% decrease observed for invasive breast cancer from 2002 to 2003.Declining EPT use from 2002 to 2003 should have precipitated an increase in the incidence of colorectal cancer, but the opposite trend was seen in the SEER 9 database during this time. The incidences of invasive breast cancer and colorectal cancer both declined by a similar amount from 2002 to 2003, despite the results of the WHI study predicting opposing trends for the two different types of cancer. Thus, the SEER 9 findings are fundamentally incompatible with expectations from the WHI findings. This implies that reductions in HT use from 2002 to 2003 cannot account for the contemporaneous changes in invasive breast cancer and colorectal cancer incidences. Alternative explanations must be found.",

Women with minor alleles at T-48444C in PPARD showed a significantly higher adjusted hazard ratio of 1.57 (95% confidence interval: 1.18\u20132.10) for earlier natural menopause.

These associations did not substantially alter when re-analyzed after excluding the subjects who self-reported a history of diabetes or the subjects whose age was more than 65 years.Gene variants in PPARD and PPARGC1A might be associated with timing of natural menopause, probably through direct actions on the ovaries, among the general Japanese population.",

There was a trend for a higher baseline expression in untreated HBL-100 and BT-474 in comparison to MCF-7 cells, which was significant for OATP-2B1. T treatment led to decreased OATP-1A2, -2B1, and -3A1 expression in BT-474 and HBL-100 cells, respectively. In contrast, in MCF-7 cells, OATP-2B1 expression was significantly increased. T-induced upregulation of AR and PR protein expression in BT-474 and MCF-7 cells was reduced by A treatment.T may constitute a signal for differential regulation of mammary OATP expression. In non-malignant breast cells T seems to have a beneficial effect by reducing the availability of substrates for the intracellular formation of potent estrogens.",

In the stage II, 14 SNPs, the majority of which were SNPs located in coding region and tagging SNPs, were genotyped. Distributions of 9 SNPs of them including one nonsynonymous SNP (rs20558) and one haplotype (HT1, C-C-T-G-C-C-A-T-T-C) were significantly higher in POF patients than in control group (86.6% and 74.5%, respectively, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.209, CI: 1.139\u20134.284, P\u00a0=\u00a00.017).We showed for the first time that LAMC1 is significantly associated with POF, and specifically, possession of at least one HT1 was associated with susceptibility to POF. This result means that HT1 may co-exist with causative variant for susceptibility to POF in linkage disequilibrium and that the LAMC1 may be involved in POF pathogenesis.",

Internal consistency of the tool was also assessed.Median age of the whole sample was 49 years, 51.1% were postmenopausal, 43.8% lived at high altitude, 12.6% used hormone therapy (HT), 58.5% presented hot flushes, 43.5% were abdominally obese and 80.8% had a partner. Overall, 72.4% of surveyed women reported sexual activity (n\u00a0=\u00a0655/904) with 65% of these presenting total FSFI-6 scores equal or below 20 the calculated median (lower sexual function). A 10.2% of those having a partner were sexually inactive. Internal consistency of tool was high (Cronbach's alpha\u00a0=\u00a00.91). Total FSFI-6 scores positively correlated with coital frequency and female and partner educational level and inversely with female age, waist circumference, hot flush intensity and partner age (bivariate analysis). Multiple linear regression analysis determined that lower scores (lower sexual function) were related to high altitude, history of sexual abuse, sedentarism, hot flush intensity, partner age and sexual dysfunction whereas partner educational level, coital frequency and female parity were significantly related to higher scores (better sexual function).As assessed with a consistent, short, and easy to use tool lower sexual function of this mid-aged series was related to several female and partner factors. More research with this tool is warranted.",

     "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common age-related disease that affects the tissues of the synovial joint, leading to loss of function and pain. It impacts on both patient morbidity and mortality. It is a complex, polygenic disease that lacks any large-effect susceptibility loci. Instead, OA susceptibility alleles individually contribute only modestly to the overall disease risk, making their identification challenging. Despite this, breakthroughs have occurred with compelling associations so far reported to polymorphisms within the genes GDF5 and MCF2L and to the genomic region 7q22. The latter two have emerged from genome-wide association scans, which are likely to yield more hits in the near future. As for many complex diseases, it is now apparent that epigenetic effects are also important mediators of disease biology, with DNA methylation, histone modifications and non-coding RNAs all having a role. At present, much of the epigenetic focus has been on cartilage, the tissue at the center of the OA disease process. If we are to get close to a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the impact of epigenetics on OA, then in future the other tissues of the joint will also need to be investigated. One of the more exciting insights to have emerged recently is the fact that epigenetic effects can impact on OA genetic effects and this may be a particularly fruitful avenue for integrating both as we move toward a clearer understanding of the pathophysiology of this intriguing disease.",

This includes determining the most appropriate biomarkers for monitoring changes in health and nutrition status and response to therapy in oldest old individuals. In an earlier work (Hausman et al., Maturitas 2011;68:203\u20139 [2]), we summarized studies of dietary intake and patterns of long-lived peoples and presented the current knowledge regarding vitamin B12, folate, 25(OH) vitamin D and other specific indicators of nutritional status in centenarians. The present review focuses on less specific biochemical indices of health and nutritional status and summarizes studies comparing protein, lipid and hematological biomarkers in centenarians and older adult controls. Such studies, from many countries worldwide, are often small, convenience samples of \u2018healthy\u2019 and/or community-dwelling centenarians, although a few population-based studies including participants with a broader range of physical and cognitive functioning are also presented. Though heterogeneous in design and demographic region, these studies typically show lower levels of protein and hematological indicators and improved levels of some lipid biomarkers in centenarians as compared with regionally matched older adult controls. As these biomarkers can be influenced by many factors interpretation of results must be approached with caution. Importantly, studies examining potential associations of these biomarkers with cognitive, mental and physical function must carefully control for potential confounders including genetics and chronic disease, an increasing burden at advanced age.",

     "abstract": "Obesity and metabolic syndrome are increasing global health problems. In addition to the malnutrition of a sedentary lifestyle, high calorie intake leads to obesity with many negative health consequences. Macrophages infiltrate adipose tissue and induce chronic inflammation by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines, including COX-2 and iNOS, among other mediators of inflammation. Free fatty acids mediate adipose tissue signalling through toll-like receptor 4 and the expression of these pro-inflammatory mediators via NF-\u03baB or JNK. PPAR \u03b3 activators can inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB, down-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here we provide an overview of how different culinary herbs and spices exert anti-inflammatory activities and the extent to which they activate PPAR \u03b1 and PPAR \u03b3, inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB, and enhance expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Spices can play essential roles as anti-inflammatory agents in our diet, acting as pan PPAR activators and improving insulin sensitivity, counteracting dyslipidaemia and weight gain. The effects of chronic inflammation caused by obesity are counteracted and, consequently, the progression of diseases associated with chronic inflammation slowed.",

     "abstract": "Obesity is increasing in most western countries and rises significantly with age. Obese women are as sexually active as women of normal weight, and new sexual relationships in the older reproductive years are becoming more commonplace and still require effective contraception. Continuation of pregnancy in a woman over 40 carries health risks which are exacerbated by the presence of obesity. A high proportion of pregnancies in women over 40 are unplanned and end in therapeutic abortion. The prevalence of obesity and the high rates of contraceptive use amongst older women mean that any increase in associated risk is likely to be of public health concern. There are very few data on the specific risks of contraceptive use in obese older women. As fertility declines with age, all methods become increasingly effective. No single method is contraindicated by age alone but particular caution is required where the use of estrogen containing preparations is considered as the risks associated with estrogen are all also independently associated with increasing age and body mass index. Non-estrogen containing methods are available, whether hormonal, barrier or surgical, which are effective, acceptable and safer in the obese older woman. Some methods of contraception may indeed have particular non-contraceptive benefits for this population.",

     "abstract": "Sex hormones play essential roles in the regulation of appetite, eating behaviour and energy metabolism and have been implicated in several major clinical disorders in women. Estrogen inhibits food intake, whereas progesterone and testosterone may stimulate appetite. This review describes recent findings concerning interactions between sex hormones and neuroendocrinological mechanisms in the control of appetite and eating in women. Furthermore, we are gaining insights into the roles played by sex hormones in the development of eating disorders and obesity. For instance, androgens may promote bulimia by stimulating appetite and reducing impulse control, a proposal supported by the observation that antiandrogenic treatment attenuates bulimic behaviour. Androgens are also involved in the pathophysiology of abdominal obesity in women. On the other hand, hormone replacement therapy with estrogen counteracts the weight gain and accumulation of abdominal fat associated with the menopausal transition. In conclusion, sex hormones and/or agents that exhibit similar activities may provide novel strategies for the treatment of eating disorders and android obesity, two of the most serious health problems for women today.",

     "abstract": "Frailty is a syndrome characterized by diminished ability to re-establish homeostasis in response to stress. We hypothesized that deficient allostatic responses to physiological challenges may predispose to frailty, that C-reactive protein (CRP) and its genetic determinants may be a measure of the integrity of the allostatic response, and that genetic determinants of the allostatic response determine the risk of frailty.Cross-sectional study of 3778 community-dwelling older men identified by random sampling of the Australian electoral roll. Explanatory variables included demographic, clinical, lifestyle behaviors, serum high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP), and CRP 1444C>T and 1846G>A genotypes. These respective polymorphisms increase and decrease the basal concentration of hsCRP. The study outcome was frailty defined by a score of\u00a0\u2265\u00a04 on the FRAIL scale.The mean age of participants was 77.1 years (SD: 3.6) and frailty was present in 196 (5.2%). The serum concentration of hsCRP was higher in frail than non-frail men (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but levels varied according to genotypes. The odds of frailty increased progressively from GG to GA and AA genotypes of the CRP1846G>A gene (z\u00a0=\u00a03.93, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and were 2.43 (95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.62\u20133.67) times greater in men with CRP1846G>A AA compared with GG genotypes. The CRP 1444C>T was not associated with frailty.Frail people have raised serum concentrations of CRP, presumably in response to the stress of underlying cause(s). However, frail individuals carrying the CRP1846G>A polymorphism seem less able to mount an efficient allostatic response, which may underpin their increased odds of frailty.",

Daily PA and PA intensity was measured using accelerometry and subjects completed a battery of psychological measures.Within person analysis identified significant relations between PA and HFs in 50% of subjects, although the specific PA indicators that predicted HFs varied, both in terms of direction and magnitude. Perceived control over HFs was the variable that most consistently differentiated between women for whom more PA was associated with fewer HFs as compared to those for whom more PA was associated with more HFs, but other individual difference characteristics such as affect, depressive symptoms, and anxiety were identified.There is great individual variation in the way daily PA impacts self-reported HFs.

Women reported that poor working environment and work policies and conditions, functioning as sources of work stress, aggravated their menopausal symptoms. Disclosure of their menopausal status was uncommon; limited time and socio-cultural barriers were the most commonly reported reasons for non-disclosure.It could be concluded that the menopause transition is an important occupational health issue especially for women in developing countries.

Although the causes are various, diabetes is the most common cause of CKD in the United States and an increasing cause of the same worldwide. Therefore, we chose to focus on diabetic chronic kidney disease in this review.The pathogenesis is multifactorial involving adaptive hyperfiltration, advanced glycosylated end-product synthesis (AGES), prorenin, cytokines, nephrin expression and impaired podocyte-specific insulin signaling. Treatments focus on lifestyle interventions including control of hyperglycemia, hypertension and hyperlipidemia as well treatment of complications and preparation for renal replacement therapy. This review examines the current literature on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, complications and treatment of CKD as well as possible areas of future disease intervention.",

Most interventions do not target aged patient but there is unequivocal evidence to promote rehabilitation in multidisciplinary stroke units or integrated care of a multidisciplinary team in the community. Most research has focused on the effect of interventions on recovery in different forms of impairment and disability. The most promising options for motor recovery of the arm include constraint-induced movement therapy and robotic-assisted strategies. Interventions to improve postural stability and gait include fitness training, high-intensity therapy, and repetitive-task training. However, information about the clinical effect of various strategies of cognitive rehabilitation and strategies for aphasia and dysarthria is scarce. Several large trials of rehabilitation practice are underway to test these interventions in the elderly, either alone or in combination with early mobilisation, cardiorespiratory fitness training and physical exercise.",

     "abstract": "Sarcopenia, defined as a syndrome rather than as a pathology, is the loss of muscle mass and function associated with age. Sarcopenia is an enigma for medicine, and despite the numerous publications available in the literature and the number of papers currently being published, there is no agreement about its definition, and even less about its root causes. One salient aspect that proves the lack of consensus is the fact that different working groups are still debating about the right name for this syndrome (which is associated with the loss of muscle mass and strength in the elderly).In hospitalized patients, sarcopenia has been shown to raise the risk of complications such as infections, pressure ulcers, loss of autonomy, institutionalization and poor quality of life, as well as to increase mortality.The factors that contribute to the development of sarcopenia in the elderly are: the state of chronic inflammation, atrophy of motoneurons, reduced protein intake (secondary among others to the condition defined as geriatric anorexia), and immobility. There is ongoing debate about the causes of sarcopenia, but the aspect that generates most interest today is the quest to achieve repeatable and clinically useful diagnostic criteria for its diagnosis, prevention and treatment.The aim of this narrative review is to summarise the abundant information available in the literature and to draw useful conclusions.",

     "abstract": "Depressive disorders and symptoms are common among middle-aged women. The effects of hormones on depression remain unclear. This review aims to clarify the nature of depressive disorders during the menopause transition as well as their links with climacteric syndrome, sexuality, cardiovascular risk and cognitive function.The recent literature on depressive disorders and menopause is reviewed.Women are more vulnerable than men to depressive disorders. Endocrine influences have been postulated but differences in, for example, coping style and response to stress may also contribute to the gender difference in the prevalence of depressive disorders. Gender differences in socialization may lead to higher rates of depression in women. There are data top suggest that menopause and depression are associated, although there is not a common clear causative factor. Women with climacteric symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia) are more likely to report anxiety and/or depressive symptoms. Bothersome vasomotor symptoms could be associated with sleep disturbances, which in turn can increase reports of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Biopsychosocial and partner factors have a significant influence on middle-aged women's sexuality and depressive disorders, and most antidepressants can have a negative effect on sexual response. Lastly, studies have consistently shown that women with high levels of depressive symptoms are at greater cardiovascular risk and have poorer cognitive function than non-depressed women. At present, a direct relationship between psychiatric symptoms and hormonal changes such as estrogen decrease has not been clearly found. Stress, educational level, ethnicity, socioeconomic factors and partner status may influence the prevalence and clinical course of both menopause symptoms and depressive disorders. Since in many cases depression is a lifelong condition, and is associated with severe comorbid conditions, further studies are needed to improve the early diagnosis of depression; it may be advisable to monitor a woman's mental health during the menopause transition to prevent a depressive disorder having long-term negative consequences.",

     "abstract": "Cigarette smoking poses substantial health risks at any age, but is particularly dangerous for older smokers, who are already at heightened risk for various health conditions. Studies suggest that older smokers are motivated to quit and succeed, but few of these have been randomized controlled trials. There is a need to systematically evaluate the research on effective interventions in older smokers.We followed PRISMA guidelines in the development of this systematic review, which included randomized controlled trials of cessation interventions with smokers aged 50 or older.We found 740 unique titles matching specified search criteria; 13 met final eligibility criteria. Nearly all the cessation treatments combined counseling with other strategies. Eight studies provided smoking cessation medications. None of the studies used newer forms of technology such as web- or text-based interventions. Nine of the 13 studies reported a significant intervention effect at one or more time points, with three studies reporting sustained treatment effects at 12\u00a0mos or longer. In general, more intensive interventions and those with combined approaches including medications and follow-up counseling achieved the best outcomes.The quit rates from these studies and the relative effectiveness of different intervention approaches are consistent with the general smoking cessation literature. However, in most studies, treatment effects were of short duration, and absolute quit rates were low, leaving the vast majority of older smokers at high risk for smoking-related health conditions. This systematic review suggests a need for additional research to design and test future interventions specifically tailored for older smokers.",

We investigated an association between depression and bone mineral density (BMD) in the Korean elderly.Cross-sectional data analysis of a community-based study, Kangwha Island, South Korea.BMD, measured at the os calcis using a quantitative ultrasound device, was expressed as stiffness index and T-score. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Korean version of Beck Depression Inventory (K-BDI). Depression was defined as a K-BDI score of 16 or higher. Participants also completed a questionnaire, including demographic factors, metabolic abnormalities, and health-related lifestyle factors.A total of 932 local residents (422 men and 510 women) aged 60\u201380 years completed the questionnaires and baseline BMD evaluation. Men with depression had a significantly lower stiffness index compared to those without depression in an age-adjusted (77.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 vs. 86.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and a multivariate-adjusted model (78.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 vs. 85. 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007).

Multivariate regression analysis showed that higher total QOL scores were predicted by being married (separated/divorced/widowed: beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22123.17, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.008), by physical exercise (beta\u00a0=\u00a04.84 and beta\u00a0=\u00a04.57 for 1\u20133\u00a0h and >3\u00a0h per week respectively, p-value\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and by a good financial status (beta\u00a0=\u00a07.05, p-value\u00a0<\u00a00.001), while a higher score in the Greene scale resulted in lower total QOL scores (beta\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.77, p-value\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Women with a better QOL were more health conscious and more probable to have utilized the public health preventive resources.Menopause as a life event has no effect on the QOL of Greek middle-aged women. On the contrary, the presence and intensity of climacteric symptoms have a negative impact on all aspects of QOL.

In perimenopausal women the effect of E2 was minor. In both groups, age modified cognitive performance, but more so in postmenopausal women. Education did not have any effect on cognitive performance in perimenopausal women, whereas in postmenopausal women education exceeded age as a source of variation.

A variety of variables derived from activity counts or recognition of performed activities were reported in healthy older adults as well as in in-care older adults. Three variables were possible to compare across studies, level of Energy Expenditure in kcal per day and activity recognition in terms of total time in walking and total activity. However, physical activity measured by these variables demonstrated large variation between studies and did not distinguish activity between healthy and in-care samples.There is a rich variety in methods used for data collection and analysis as well as in reported variables. Different aspects of physical activity can be described, but the variety makes it challenging to compare across studies. There is an urgent need for developing consensus on activity monitoring protocols and which variables to report.",

     "publication date": "01-2012",
     "abstract": "Our understanding of female reproductive function has been hampered by our inability to directly assess the number of non-growing primordial follicles present in the ovary, the ovarian reserve. Female reproductive hormones (FSH and LH, the inhibins and steroids) reflect the activity of the larger growing follicles and thus are largely informative of peri-ovulatory ovarian activity. In contrast anti-M\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) is a product of the granulosa cells of small growing follicles, whose number (and therefore circulating AMH concentrations) is reflective of the ovarian reserve. AMH declines with age in adult women, and emerging data suggest a relationship with remaining reproductive lifespan and age at the menopause. Early studies demonstrated that AMH concentrations are stable across the menstrual cycle, adding to its clinical utility. The most established role for AMH measurement is in women about to start IVF treatment, where it is predictive of the ovarian response and is of clear value in identifying women at risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome or whose response will be poor and thus their expectations can be tailored. AMH is detectable in childhood, and although relationships to puberty are not yet available, it appears that AMH rises to a peak in the early 20s. Developing indications include in assessment and individualisation of the risk to fertility from chemotherapy, in the diagnosis of PCOS and as a tumour marker in granulosa cell tumours. The increasingly routine use of AMH by IVF clinics heralds much wider adoption in a range of clinical situations across the reproductive lifespan.",

Three polymorphisms in/nearby TNFRSF11B have been associated with BMD variations in some populations. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible association among three SNPs of TNFRSF11B and their haplotypes with the presence of BMD variations in postmenopausal Mexican Mestizo women.One thousand unrelated postmenopausal women of Mexican-Mestizo ethnic origin, who attended the outpatient clinic for routine, general medical evaluation, were invited and 750 women accepted to participate in the study. A structured questionnaire for risk factors was applied and BMD was measured in total hip and lumbar spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. DNA was obtained from blood leukocytes. Three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in TNFRSF11B gene were studied: rs4355801, rs2073618, and rs6993813. Real-time PCR allelic discrimination was used for genotyping. Deviations from Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium were tested. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium between single nucleotide polymorphisms was calculated by direct correlation r2, and haplotype analysis was conducted.Of the subjects, 31% had osteoporosis, 45.1% had osteopenia, and 23.9% had normal BMD.

Two-equation probit models were used to determine independent predictors of self-reported physical and mental health, using data from 1071 community-based adults (\u226560 years). An additional bivariate analysis was conducted to investigate the characteristics of caregivers who reported better physical health.Approximately 17% (n\u00a0=\u00a0183) of respondents reported being caregivers, and those in caregiving roles tended to be ethnic minorities, married, and have telephone communication with family or friends on a daily basis. Better physical and mental health outcomes were common for caregivers and non-caregivers who reported having more resources (e.g., higher income, better preparedness for future financial need, higher satisfaction with transportation and housing, and no limitation of usual daily activities). However, sociodemographic and social support factors were not significantly associated with physical and mental health among caregivers, unlike their non-caregiver counterparts. In the probit model, caregivers were more likely to be physically healthy compared to non-caregivers (Coefficient\u00a0=\u00a00.34; p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.031). Compared with healthy non-caregivers (n\u00a0=\u00a0631), healthy caregivers (n\u00a0=\u00a0141) tended to be ethnic minorities, married, and have telephone communication with family or friends on a daily basis.Findings suggest that preparing resources and maintaining strong social support systems may foster health status among older family caregivers.",

Eligible women had their blood pressure, weight and height measured, and donated a blood sample for hormone and genetic analyses. The participants also completed a detailed study survey. Women were grouped according to their genotype, blood pressure measurements, and medical history. The data were analyzed using logistic and linear regression models. The study had 80% power to detect small differences in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP; 4.5\u00a0mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP; 3\u00a0mmHg).The selected polymorphism was significantly associated with hypertension and SBP in unadjusted analyses. Interestingly, women with hypertension were more likely to be homozygous for the A allele (AA) compared to women who were not categorized as having hypertension. Further, the mean SBP was significantly higher for women who were homozygous for the A allele when compared to women carrying the other genotypes (AG or GG). The unadjusted association between DBP values and genotype was of borderline statistical significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). However, after adjustment for potential confounders (age, race, body mass index (BMI), smoking and physical activity), the associations between genotype and hypertension/blood pressure were attenuated and not statistically significant.The rs700518 polymorphism in the CYP19A1 is not associated with hypertension in our sample of midlife women.

However the evidence is robust for skeletal but not nonskeletal outcomes where data from large prospective studies are lacking. The major natural source of vitamin D is cutaneous synthesis through exposure to sunlight with a small amount from the diet in animal-based foods such as fatty fish, eggs and milk. Vitamin D status is determined by measuring serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. Optimal serum 25(OH)D levels are in the region of 30\u201390\u00a0ng/mL (75\u2013225\u00a0nmol/L) though there is no international consensus. Levels vary according to time of the year (lower in the winter), latitude, altitude, air pollution, skin pigmentation, use of sunscreens and clothing coverage. Risk factors for low serum 25(OH)D levels include: obesity, malabsorption syndromes, medication use (e.g. anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals), skin aging, low sun exposure and those in residential care. Fortified foods do not necessarily provide sufficient amounts of vitamin D. Regular sunlight exposure (without sunscreens) for 15\u00a0min, 3\u20134 times a week, in the middle of the day in summer generate healthy levels. The recommended daily allowance is 600\u00a0IU/day increasing to 800\u00a0IU/day in those aged 71\u00a0years and older.

Volunteering was defined as an activity that is freely chosen, does not involve remuneration and helps or benefits those beyond an individual's immediate family. Our search identified 22 studies and 5 review articles that addressed the benefits of volunteering on older people's quality of life. Most of the research had been conducted in the United States, Canada and Australia using data from longitudinal studies. The majority of the studies concluded that there is a positive association between older people's quality of life and engagement in volunteering. Due to the study designs and the heterogeneity of the research, causality is difficult to demonstrate and the knowledge the studies bring to the subject is variable.

Three meta-analyses evaluated the effects of soy isoflavones on lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter BMD. Soy isoflavones significantly improved lumbar spine BMD in a moderate manner, but did not affect total hip, femoral neck, and trochanter BMD in menopausal women. Ingestion of soy isoflavones for six months appeared to be enough to exert a beneficial effect on lumbar spine BMD. Two meta-analyses evaluated the effects of soy isoflavones on a bone resorption marker (urine deoxypyridinoline) and two formation markers (serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin). Soy isoflavones significantly decreased urine deoxypyridinoline in a moderate manner, but did not affect serum alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in menopausal women. Soy isoflavones may prevent postmenopausal osteoporosis and improve bone strength thus decreasing risk of fracture in menopausal women by increasing lumbar spine BMD and decreasing bone resorption marker urine deoxypyridinoline. Further studies are needed to address factors affecting the magnitude of the beneficial effects of soy isoflavones and to assess the possible interactions between soy isoflavones and anti-osteoporosis drugs, and to verify effects on BMD of other skeletal sites and other bone turnover markers.",

     "abstract": "Three well-known and indisputable risk factors contribute to the development of prostate cancer, namely heredity, ethnic origin and increasing age. Geographic variations in incidence rates are considerable and it has, therefore, been suggested that environmental factors may also play a role. Migration studies clearly show that men with the same genetic background raised in different environments show a similar risk of developing the disease to those in their country of residency. Prostate cancer is a good candidate for studies on primary prevention thanks to specific features such as high prevalence, long latency, hormonal dependency, serum markers for monitoring (prostate-specific antigen) and histological precursor lesions (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia). Nutritional factors that may influence the disease include total energy intake (as reflected by body mass index), dietary fat, cooked meat, micronutrients and vitamins (carotenoids, retinoids, vitamins C, D and E), fruit and vegetable intake, minerals (calcium, selenium), and phytoestrogens (isoflavonoids, flavonoids, lignans). Most published studies have been case\u2013control analyses. The selenium and vitamin E cancer prevention trial (SELECT), however, was a population-based, prospective, randomized clinical trial that examined the effect of selenium and vitamin E alone or in combination on prostate cancer risk reduction. The trial was recently discontinued due to no evidence of benefit from either agent. Nevertheless, lifestyle changes can still be recommended for men at risk of developing clinical prostate cancer.",

This review is focused on the clinical aspects, the indices for assessment severity, newly markers related to prognosis and new therapeutic modalities for the elderly population. The term low flow, low gradient severe aortic stenosis with preserved LV systolic function has revealed a new modality in the field of diagnostic evaluation and therapeutic approach. Aortic valve replacement is the choice therapy for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Despite the recent advances in cardiac surgery, the overall operative mortality rate for isolated aortic valve replacement surgery ranges from 2.5% to 4.0% and is higher in octogenarians and can be up to 25% in patients with comorbid conditions. The fact that surgery is not being performed for 30% or more of patients requiring it, a great attention was attracted to the percutaneous transcatheter implantation of a stent-mounted aortic valve. The up to now experience of transcatheter valve implantation in more than 25,000 patients, has shown promising results in terms of mortality and quality of life. Echocardiography still plays the central role for the evaluation of the elderly patient, as it can illustrate the pathophysiological alterations during the course of aortic valve stenosis, and guide appropriate therapy.",

     "abstract": "Hormone therapy (HT) is the most effective treatment for correcting menopausal symptoms after menopause. HT initially consisted of estrogens alone and progestogens were secondly added to estrogens for preventing the risk of endometrial cancer associated to estrogens use. Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, is a major harmful effect of HT. It is now well known that oral and transdermal estrogens are differentially associated with VTE risk but progestogens may be another important determinant of the thrombotic risk among HT users. Both randomized controlled trials and meta-analysis of observational studies suggested that the VTE risk was higher among users of estrogens plus progestogens than among users of estrogens alone. With respect to the different pharmacological classes of progestogens, there is evidence for a deleterious effect of medroxyprogesterone acetate on VTE risk. In addition, observational studies showed that norpregnane derivatives were significantly associated with an increased VTE risk whereas micronized progesterone could be safe with respect to thrombotic risk. The effect of tibolone on VTE risk remains uncertain. In conclusion, progestogens may have differential effects on VTE risk according to the molecules and therefore represent an important potential determinant of the thrombotic risk among postmenopausal women using estrogens.",

     "abstract": "Climacteric symptoms such as hot flushes and vaginal dryness are very common in breast cancer patients, resulting either from age or adjuvant therapy. Tibolone, a synthetic steroid, is effective in reducing these symptoms in healthy post-menopausal women, but this has never been studied in a large breast cancer population.The primary objective of LIBERATE trial was to study safety of tibolone 2.5\u00a0mg daily versus placebo as primary, in symptomatic breast cancer survivors. The aim of this present paper was to report effects of tibolone on climacteric symptoms, vaginal dryness and health-related quality of life in the study population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, n. NCT00408863.The trial was conducted between June 2002 and July 2007. Concerning quality of life variables, a daily Diary Cards during the first three months and the Climacteric Symptoms Form and at each visit were used to register frequency and intensity of hot flushes. Mean vaginal dryness scores were calculated on the basis of individual ratings at baseline and at week 104. A subset of patients assessed their quality of life filling in the Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ).Of the 3148 women recruited, 3133 received trial medication (1575 in the tibolone group and 1558 in the placebo group). The median duration of treatment was 2.75 years. In total 3098 women (1556 on tibolone, 1542 on placebo) were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population for efficacy analysis. Data on vaginal dryness are available for 2144 patients and 883 women (438 on tibolone, 445 on placebo) answered to WHQ. The mean change in number of hot flushes per day was 2.74 (43.1%) in the tibolone group and \u22121.77 (\u221227.5%) in the placebo group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) at week 12 and \u22124.62 (\u221265.6%) on tibolone as compared to \u22123.73 (\u221252.5%) on placebo (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) at week 104. For the composite score the mean changes at week 12 were \u22120.19 (\u221210.6%) and \u22120.14 (\u22127.7%), respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0006). Vaginal dryness score improved at week 104 in the tibolone group as compared to placebo (\u22120.46 versus \u22120.29, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Across the assessments up to two years with WHQ, tibolone was more effective than placebo in improving sexual health, sleep quality and mood domains. Women using tamoxifen showed less improvement in climacteric symptoms with tibolone, than women only receiving tibolone without any adjuvant therapy.The results of the LIBERATE trial show that tibolone is effective in symptomatic breast cancer patients and improves their quality of life. However, this finding should be judged within the context of the main outcome of the trial, showing that tibolone increases the risk of recurrence. The use of tibolone in women with breast cancer will remain contraindicated and any off-label use incurs a now proven risk.",

Data on HT use, VMS and potential confounders were collected by questionnaires.CHD endpoints, obtained via registries.252 CHD cases occurred during 10.3 years of follow-up. Neither for women with nor for women without flushing or (night) sweats ever HT use was associated with CHD risk, compared with never HT use. Among women with intense VMS, ever HT use borderline significantly decreased CHD risk compared with never HT use (HR 0.48 [95% CI 0.20\u20131.03]). Among women without intense VMS, ever HT use was associated with a borderline significant increased CHD risk (HR 1.28 [95% CI 0.96\u20131.70]; P for interaction\u00a0=\u00a00.02). However, after multivariate adjustment, as compared to never HT use, ever HT use was not associated with risk of CHD among women with or without intense VMS.In both groups of women with and without VMS, HT use does not seem to be associated with the risk of CHD. Hence, our findings do not support the view that HT use increases the CHD risk among women with an indication, i.e. VMS, but this needs to be confirmed in specifically designed studies.",

Several psychological interventions are proposed to increase the sexual quality of life in older women with diverse gynecologic pathology. A biopsychosocial approach utilizing brief strategies can be easily implemented in clinics to help women of all ages increase their sexual quality of life.Female pelvic floor disorders include urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse, and fecal incontinence. These disorders increase dramatically with increasing age. Urinary incontinence has been demonstrated to have a negative impact on a woman's sexual function. Among sexually active older women with urinary incontinence, 22% report being moderately or extremely worried that sexual activity would cause urine loss. An increased prevalence of sexual distress [9% (6/76) vs. 1.3% (2/216), p\u00a0=\u00a00.005] has been reported in sexually active women over 40 years old with urinary incontinence. Treatment of urinary incontinence can improve sexual function in older women. Among sexually active women (N\u00a0=\u00a053) who underwent midurethral slings procedures for the correction of urinary incontinence, increased coital frequency, decrease fear of incontinence with coitus, decreased embarrassment due to incontinence was reported six months after surgery. Pelvic organ prolapse, a hernia of the vagina resulting in a visible vaginal bulge, has also been associated with a negative impact on sexual function. Women with advanced pelvic organ prolapse (POP-Q stage III or IV) have been demonstrated to have decreased body image reporting that they are more self-conscious about their appearance [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 4.7; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9, 51], feel less feminine (AOR 4.0; 95% CI 1.2, 15) and less sexually attractive (AOR 4.6; 95% CI 1.4, 17) compared with women who have normal pelvic support. Both vaginal and abdominal approaches to surgical correction of pelvic organ prolapse have been demonstrated to improve sexual function.Mental health plays a major role in older woman's sexuality. Sexual interest and satisfaction is tied to emotional expressivity, women's self-worth, feelings of depression and loneliness as well as cognitive function. Research has shown that both general practitioners and specialists lack training in sexual assessments. Behavioral health specialists, such as a psychologist, can play an integral role in helping to facilitate communication between the patient and the provider. A main focus of communication training is to facilitate open and genuine conversation between the provider and the patient. Providers are encouraged to ask open ended questions while patients are encouraged to discuss symptoms while coping with an internal state of anxiety.Despite the known prevalence of sexual dysfunction among older women, few studied empirically based interventions have been published with these women. This speaks to the general assumption among medical professionals that having the \u201csex talk\u201d in older women with gynecological pathology is not important or relevant. A biopsychosocial approach utilizing some of the aforementioned brief strategies can be easily implemented in comprehensive gynecology clinics in order to help women of all ages increase their sexual quality of life.",

Though initially applied primarily to young women with blocked Fallopian tubes, over the past three decades IVF has been increasingly used to combat age-related infertility. It has become clear that the decline in fertility with increasing female age is largely due to a rapid decrease in oocyte (egg) quantity and quality, with a higher proportion of oocytes displaying genetic abnormalities. Despite significant improvements in medical stimulation and laboratory culturing of embryos, IVF success once women reach the age of 45 is exceedingly rare. It has been well established through elegant clinical studies that, unlike the ovary, the reproductive capacity of the uterus does not diminish with age, even into the late 40s and 50s. With the use of oocytes from younger donors, women who are menopausal can attain very high rates of conception. The increased obstetrical risks in this population, which has a higher risk of underlying medical co-morbidities, must be considered prior to attempts at assisted conception, often in consultation with a multidisciplinary team of physicians. Finally, attempts to reverse the age-related decline in oocyte quality through micro-manipulation of the nucleus and cytoplasm have yielded disappointing results and are fraught with ethical concerns.",

It has been proposed that phytoestrogens (PEs), which have a similar chemical structure to estrogens, could be used as HRT. The main selling points of these preparations concern the management of hot flashes and their potential beneficial effects on breast tissue. In this review, we will address the effects of PE on hot flashes and breast cancer risk as well as the questions raised on a chemical point of view. We conclude that the efficacy of a PE rich diet or nutritional supplements is not clearly established. The use of PE as an alternative for HRT cannot be advocated for now, due to insufficient and conflicting data on efficacy and safety. Moreover, due to the hormone dependence of breast cancer, PE use must be contraindicated in breast cancer survivors.",

The aim of this review was to assess the evidence for and against the effectiveness of the maca plant as a treatment for menopausal symptoms. We searched 17 databases from their inception up to June 2011 and included all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that compared any type of maca-based intervention to a placebo for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. All studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Cochrane \u2018risk of bias\u2019 assessment tool. Four RCTs met all inclusion criteria. These RCTs tested the effects of maca on menopausal symptoms in healthy perimenopausal, early postmenopausal, and late postmenopausal women. Using the Kupperman Menopausal Index and the Greene Climacteric Score, all RCTs demonstrated favorable effects of maca. There have been very few rigorous trials of maca for menopausal symptoms. The results of our systematic review provide limited evidence for the effectiveness of maca as a treatment for menopausal symptoms. However, the total number of trials, the total sample size, and the average methodological quality of the primary studies, were too limited to draw firm conclusions. Furthermore, the safety has not been proved yet. Therefore, the efficacy and safety should be tested in larger studies.",

     "abstract": "Globally, health inequities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations exist. The disparity in health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians is exemplified by cervical cancer. Current evidence suggests that Indigenous women have higher age standardised incidence and mortality than non-Indigenous women when adjusted for stage at diagnosis and co-morbidities; however, there is little information pertaining to national estimates of cervical cancer in Indigenous women. In this paper we review available evidence on the difference in occurrence and case fatality of cervical cancer among Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australian women.The Australian Bureau of Statistics, Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, and State- or Territory-based Cancer Registries were utilised to collect surveillance data. To corroborate existing data, further available journal literature was identified through Medline and Embase. All papers selected for review were cross-referenced to identify further relevant studies.The most recent national estimate of age-standardised cervical cancer incidence rate was 16.9 and 7.1 per 100,000 women-years in Indigenous and non-Indigenous women respectively (incidence ratio 2.4). The Indigenous age-standardised mortality rate was 9.9 per 100,000 women years (95% CI 7.1\u201313.3), over 5 times the non-Indigenous rate. Cervical cancer incidence, in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous women, has decreased since 1991. Despite the decline, age-standardised incidence among Indigenous women is still higher than non-Indigenous women.The pattern of cervical cancer incidence and survival corroborates the health inequities that exist in Australia. Indigenous women are more likely than non-Indigenous women to develop cervical cancer and are less likely to survive it. Similar patterns exist in Indigenous populations worldwide, such as New Zealander Maoris and Canadian Aboriginals, suggesting that high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality may be a symptom of social and economic inequity.",

Surgical versus medical management is usually based on factors such as age and complications related to hyperparathyroidism (i.e. the presence of renal stones, renal insufficiency and bone loss and significant increases in serum calcium). Treatment options include parathyroidectomy, bisphosphonates, calcitonin and calcimimetics.In this review, we discuss primary hyperparathyroidism in detail with a focus on clinical manifestations particularly in the elderly population.

This procedure is the mainstay of ovarian and fallopian tube cancer prevention in these women. Therefore an understanding of the short and long-term impact of the surgery is essential. Salpingo-oophorectomy, particularly when done prior to natural menopause, may impact on several aspects of quality of life and health. The health benefits of this surgery (cancer prevention) should outweigh the costs of the procedure in terms of quality of life and long term health. In this review, the impact of this surgery on quality of life and health in women who carry a BRCA mutation is discussed. Preliminary studies have focused on short-term effects, such as quality of life. In the short term, overall quality of life appears to be similar before and after surgery, however vasomotor symptoms related to surgical menopause and changes in sexual functioning are common. HRT appears to mitigate some but not all of these symptoms. Women report high levels of satisfaction with their decision to have the surgery despite the impact of prophylactic salpingo-oophorectomy. Studies of the long term health and quality of life after salpingo-oophorectomy in women who carry a BRCA mutation have not yet been published.",

     "abstract": "Obesity in childhood carries a wide range of physical, psychological and social disbenefits and also increases the risk of adult obesity with its well-recognised, enhanced risk of several common complex diseases as well as adverse socioeconomic and psychosocial sequelae. Understanding the tracking of the two key modifiable behaviours, food consumption and physical activity, between childhood and adulthood may illuminate the childhood determinants of adult obesity and contribute to the development of effective interventions.We performed a systematic review of the available literature on tracking of both physical activity and of dietary intake between childhood and adulthood by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCInfo, Google and Google Scholar. For inclusion, studies had to report baseline measurements when the children were less than, or equal to, 18 years and to report follow-up for at least 5 years to any age over 18 years.After removal of duplicates, 9625 search hits were screened by title and/or abstract and 79 potentially relevant papers were identified and full papers obtained. In total 39 papers were included in this analysis. Of these, 11 papers (from 5 studies) reported data on tracking of diet from childhood to adulthood and 28 papers (from 16 studies) reported data on tracking of physical activity or inactivity.Despite the diversity of study design and measurement methodology, we found evidence of tracking of both physical activity and of diet between childhood and adulthood with estimates of strength of tracking of a similar order for both behaviours. Because of the inherent methodological difficulties in quantifying habitual behaviour, it is likely that the reported estimates of strength of tracking under-estimate the true degree of tracking. The evidence of tracking reported here may give greater impetus to the development of interventions aimed to prevent the persistence of obesity from childhood into adulthood and its attendant adverse socioeconomic, psychosocial and health sequelae.",

The paper reviews the literature on physical activity and its implications for healthcare system, and discusses potential directions for future research by highlighting the limitations of the existing studies.Although there are significant variations in samples and methods used, both streams of reviewed literature provide evidence that physical activity leads to lower utilization of healthcare services. Given differences in methods and samples in these studies, estimated effect of physical activity on healthcare utilization shows significant variation from one study to another. These results, therefore, cannot be generalized to justify population wide exercise intervention programs for older adults. Additional studies are needed to provide more robust estimates for the effects of exercise, and to examine the feasibility of population wide policies that aim to encourage participation of older adults in physical activity.",

Vasomotor symptoms generally include hot flushes and night sweats although other associated symptoms exist. Prevalence rates vary between and within populations, but different studies collect data on frequency, bothersomeness, and/or severity using different outcome measures and scales, making comparisons difficult.We reviewed only cross-cultural studies of menopausal symptoms that explicitly examined symptoms in general populations of women in different countries or different ethnic groups in the same country.

These studies highlight the methodological challenges involved in conducting multi-population studies, particularly when languages differ, but also highlight the importance of performing multivariate and factor analyses.Significant cultural differences in one or more vasomotor symptoms were observed in 8 of 9 studies, and symptoms were influenced by the following determinants: menopausal status, hormones (and variance), age (or actually, the square of age, age2), BMI, depression, anxiety, poor physical health, perceived stress, lifestyle factors (hormone therapy use, smoking and exposure to passive smoke), and acculturation (in immigrant populations).

This review also aims to examine the determinants of psychological symptoms and how those determinants were measured. The review included eight studies that explicitly compared symptoms in different countries or different ethnic groups in the same country and included: Australian/Japanese Midlife Women's Health Study (AJMWHS), Decisions At Menopause Study (DAMeS), Four Major Ethnic Groups (FMEG), Hilo Women's Health Survey (HWHS), Penn Ovarian Aging Study (POAS), Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), Women's Health in Midlife National Study (WHiMNS), and the Women's International Study of Health and Sexuality (WISHeS).This review concludes that mental morbidity does affect vasomotor symptom prevalence across cultures and therefore should be measured. Based on the review of these eight studies it is recommended that the following items be included when measuring psychological symptoms across cultures, feeling tense or nervous, sleeping difficulty, difficulty in concentrating, depressed and irritability along with the CES-D Scale, and the Perceived Stress Scale. The measurement of these symptoms will provide an evidence based approach when forming any future menopause symptom list and allow for comparisons across studies.",

The goal of this review is to examine methods used previously in cross-cultural studies of menopause and women's health at midlife to (1) identify challenges in the measurement of somatic symptoms across cultures and (2) recommend questions and tools that can be used in future research. This review also aims to examine the determinants of somatic symptoms.The review concludes that methods used for assessing somatic symptoms differ across studies. Somatic symptoms, particularly, aches, pain, and fatigue have a high prevalence. Statistically significant differences were seen in the prevalence of somatic symptoms across cultures. Based on the number of studies that demonstrated cross-cultural differences in symptom prevalence, we recommend that the following symptoms be included in future studies of symptoms at midlife: headaches, aches/pain, palpitations, dizziness, fatigue, breathing difficulties, numbness or tingling, and gastrointestinal difficulties. We also recommend that objective measures of physical function be administered when possible to supplement subjective self-evaluation.",

The purpose of this review is to examine methods used in cross-cultural comparisons of sexual symptoms among women at midlife, and to examine the determinants of sexual symptoms and how those determinants were measured. The goal of this review is to make recommendations that will improve cross-cultural comparisons in the future. The review included nine studies that explicitly examined symptoms in different countries or different ethnic groups in the same country and included: Australian/Japanese Midlife Women's Health Study (AJMWHS), Decisions At Menopause Study (DAMeS), Four Major Ethnic Groups (FMEG), Hilo Women's Health Survey (HWHS), Mid-Aged Health in Women from the Indian Subcontinent (MAHWIS), Penn Ovarian Aging Study (POAS), Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN), Women's Health in Midlife National Study (WHiMNS), and Women's International Study of Health and Sexuality (WISHeS).Although methods used for assessing sexual symptoms across cultures differed between studies, statistically significant differences were reported. Cross-cultural differences in sexual symptoms exist, and should be measured by including the following symptoms: loss of interest in sex, vaginal dryness, and the Females Sexual Function Index which covers desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain on intercourse. The measurement of these symptoms will provide an evidence-based approach when forming any future menopause symptom list and allow for comparisons across studies.",

     "abstract": "An increasing body of evidence suggests that poor nutrition at the very beginning of life \u2013 even before birth \u2013 leads to large and long term negative consequences for both mental and physical health. This paper reviews the evidence from studies on the Dutch famine, which investigated the effects of prenatal undernutrition on later health. The effects of famine appeared to depend on its timing during gestation, and the organs and tissues undergoing critical periods of development at that time. Early gestation appeared to be the most vulnerable period. People who were conceived during the famine were at increased risk of schizophrenia and depression, they had a more atherogenic plasma lipid profile, were more responsive to stress and had a doubled rate of coronary heart disease. Also, they performed worse on cognitive tasks which may be a sign of accelerated ageing. People exposed during any period of gestation had more type 2 diabetes. Future investigation will expand on the finding that the effects of prenatal famine exposure may reach down across generations, possibly through epigenetic mechanisms. Recent evidence suggests that similar effects of prenatal undernutrition are found in Africa, where many are undernourished. Hunger is a major problem worldwide with one in seven inhabitants of this planet suffering from lack of food. Adequately feeding women before and during pregnancy may be a promising strategy in preventing chronic diseases worldwide.",

Early- and late-onset bipolar disorders share symptoms, but it is not clear whether they have different aetiologies and vulnerabilities. In bipolar disorder one of the most frequent neuroimaging finding is the white matter hyperintensities (WMHs). The disruption caused by WMHs in the connectivity between structures related to mood regulation and cognition in elderly may be responsible for the affective symptomatology seen in these patients. White matter hyperintensities are found both in late onset patients and in early age onset bipolar patients. It is likely that the aetiology of the white matter hyperintensities in late-onset bipolar disorder be multifactorial, although cardiovascular changes in particular seem to contribute to their physiopathology. In early life onset the aetiology of these lesions is less clear, although probably genetic factors are more important than cardiovascular factors. Understanding the aetiopathogenesis is of key importance when dealing with this disease.",

Rates of dementia are extremely high in this age group and will present a major public health burden as the numbers of these individuals quadruple by the middle of the century. Studies in this age group are rare and frequently have small numbers of participants. In research studies and the clinic, the diagnosis of dementia and determination of the etiology of the disorder are challenging. In this review, we include some of our experiences in a population-based longitudinal investigation, The 90+ Study. Oldest-old individuals are more likely to suffer from medical comorbidities and have high rates of sensory loss, psychoactive medication usage, frailty and fatigue. Moreover, social and cultural expectations affect the reporting and interpretation of behavioral changes. These and other factors make it difficult to determine the relative contributions of cognitive losses and non-cognitive losses in the development of functional disability. Contributing further to the complexities of diagnosis, current research suggests that dementia in the oldest-old, compared to younger people, is more likely to be related to mixed disease pathologies. Frequent cerebral neuropathologies include Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration, small and large vessel vascular disease, and hippocampal sclerosis. More research is necessary in the oldest-old to better understand the etiologies of dementia in this age group, and factors that may affect the expression of disease as we age.",

     "abstract": "Endothelial dysfunction frequently ensues during the climacteric due to hormonal and metabolic changes. Non-pharmacological interventions such as lifestyle and dietary modifications are emerging as valuable strategies to counteract the cardiovascular consequences of ageing. A number of chemical components of wine, including alcohol and some polyphenols, are known to be active on the vessels. However, the molecular mechanisms through which they modulate endothelial function are largely unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of non-alcoholic wine fractions from five different wines on the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) via the expression and enzymatic activation of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human endothelial cells. All non-alcoholic fractions studied increased NO synthesis, although with different potencies. All wine extracts maximally enhanced NO production at doses in the range achieved with a moderate wine intake, with decreasing effects with further increases of the dose. Interestingly, a part of these actions was recruited via estrogen receptors (ERs). Within the polyphenols with known binding activity for ERs contained in the tested wines, resveratrol, epicatechin, syringic acid, apigenin, malvidin and ellagic acid were largely responsible for eNOS activation. These findings show that some of the non-alcoholic components of wine enhance the production of NO by the vessels acting on ERs, and suggest that a moderate intake of wine may benefit the cardiovascular system through estrogen-like effects.",

Major anthropometric and biochemical measures included body mass index (BMI), waist to hip ratio (WHR), fasting and postload glucose and insulin, serum CRP, UA, lipids profile, and magnesium. IR was estimated using fasting glucose and insulin by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).Multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that Lg CRP, WHR, serum triglycerides (TGs) and magnesium were the major predictors of HOMA-IR. A multivariate logistic analyses showed that a CRP level above 3.0\u00a0mg/l was significantly associated with a 2.8-fold risk of having higher HOMA-IR (>2.52). BMI plays a key role in mediating the relationship of CRP and IR. Elevated serum TG (>1.71\u00a0mmol/l), WHR (>0.88), UA (>357\u00a0mmol/l) and lower serum magnesium (<0.78\u00a0mg/l) were associated with 5.26 (95%CI: 2.52\u201310.98, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), 3.02 (95%CI: 1.64\u20135.55, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), 1.97 (95%CI: 1.02\u20133.83, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05) and 0.51 (95%CI: 0.28\u20130.81) folds risk of higher HOMA-IR, respectively in the unadjusted model.

It is now clear that the hormonal changes that occur during a woman's life, particularly her estrogen status, can modulate disease activity. This is especially true for cardiovascular and musculo-skeletal diseases, which are two leading causes of morbidity and mortality in women. With the general aging of the population they represent a serious and growing public health concern.Estrogen synthesis and blood levels fluctuate during a woman's life and in this review three broad periods will be considered: reproductive phase, transition and postmenopausal phase. Generally speaking, women in the reproductive phase of their life are at low risk of cardiovascular and musculo-skeletal disorders. However, the onset of menopause and the loss of ovarian function is associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of diseases such as coronary heart disease, osteoarthritis and osteoporosis. The prevalence of these debilitating diseases continues to increase through the postmenopausal period. Estrogen replacement is an obvious treatment approach to counter the problems associated with the loss of ovarian function and subsequent estrogen deficiency. Overall, oral and transdermal estrogen replacement are similarly effective in relieving menopausal symptoms and disorders that manifest during this period of a woman's life. Transdermal estrogen may be preferable in older women because of its lower thrombogenic potential.In this journey through a woman's life current best evidence relating to cardiovascular and musculo-skeletal risk will be reviewed in line with well documented management strategies.",

Aging is often associated with a decrease in serum thyroid stimulating hormone and T3 levels, whereas serum free T4 levels usually remain unchanged. The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction is higher in the elderly as compared to the younger population. In elderly individuals the non-specific clinical manifestations of thyroid hormone excess or deprivation can cause confusion in the clinical setup; while some of the symptoms of thyroid disease are similar to those in younger patients, it is not uncommon for both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism to be manifested in subtle ways in older patients, often mimicking symptoms of aging or masquerading as diseases of the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or nervous system. In addition, diagnosis of thyroid disorders is commonly complicated, due to chronic, non-thyroidal illness or medication therapy. Early diagnosis and treatment of overt thyroid disorders is crucial, since these disorders are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in the elderly, usually due to common coexistent diseases such as diminished cardiovascular reserve. Treatment of subclinical thyroid disease should also be considered, based on a combination of age, symptoms and risk factors in the individual patients. In addition, both prevalence and aggressiveness of thyroid cancer increase with age.

     "abstract": "Vaginal atrophy is a common symptom of postmenopausal estrogen deficiency and can present as dryness, irritation, infection and dyspareunia and can affect sexual function and quality of life. Currently vaginal atrophy is treated with the intravaginal application of preparations containing estradiol or estriol, which are both effective and safe. It has been proposed that intravaginally administered dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can be used to treat vaginal atrophy. DHEA and its sulphate DHEAS are the most abundant circulating sex steroid hormones in women, and provide a large precursor reservoir for the intracellular production of androgens and estrogens in non-reproductive tissues. Levels of DHEA and DHEAS decline with age. Although there is some evidence to support the use of intravaginal DHEA for postmenopausal women with symptoms of vaginal atrophy, independent studies are required to confirm this. In addition studies regarding the effects of vaginal DHEA on sexual function in women without vaginal atrophy are needed. Given that the efficacy and long term safety of low dose vaginal estradiol and estriol therapy is well established and that vaginal estrogen requires application of 2\u20133 times a week, rather than daily dosing; the benefit of daily vaginal DHEA over estrogen also needs to be considered as women may find it unpalatable to adhere to daily dosing with a cream preparation.",

Selection of the most promising therapeutic targets from a host of current and potential candidates depends heavily on their roles in the pathophysiology of PE. Possible central nervous targets that will be discussed are serotonin transporters, and CNS receptors for 5-HTIA and 5-HT1B, dopamine, oxytocin, opioids, neurokinin-1, and glutamate. Putative peripheral targets include \u03b11-adrenoceptors, phosphodiestrase enzymes, Rho kinases, purinergic (P2X) receptors, and penile sensory nerves. It is clear that exploiting the full therapeutic potential of these targets will require additional basic and clinical research.",

The aim of this overview of systematic reviews is to critically evaluate the evidence for or against the effectiveness of CAM. Six electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant systematic reviews (SRs). Their methodological quality was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Oxman score. Four SRs met our inclusion criteria. They evaluated: acupuncture, ginseng, maca and yohimbine. The methodological quality of all of the SRs was good. However, the primary studies were often associated with considerable risk of bias. Cautiously positive conclusions were drawn for yohimbine and ginseng as treatment options for ED. For acupuncture and maca the evidence was insufficient for ED and SD respectively. It is concluded that there is some encouraging evidence but more and better studies are required to establish the value of CAM for SD and ED.",

     "abstract": "Research in the area of gynaecological cancer has increasingly examined changes to women's sexuality, with the impact of treatment on sexual wellbeing considered particularly important. The objective of this paper is to review research on gynaecological cancer and sexuality from the years 1990 to 2011. Research has documented a range of post-treatment anatomical and physical changes to women's sexual wellbeing, including changes to sexual desire, pleasure, orgasm, vaginal lubrication, genital sensitivity, arousal, and frequency of sex. Women's intrapsychic experiences of changes to sexuality include anxiety, depression, distress, and negative perceptions of sexual identity and body image. Socially constructed discourses surrounding gender and sexuality also shape women's experiences of their sexual wellbeing post-gynaecological cancer and treatment, with many women feeling a loss of womanhood and femininity with the removal of, or changes to, their reproductive organs. Finally, women's relationship context, pattern of couple communication, and partner support are associated with women's ability to cope with changes to sexuality post-gynaecological cancer. Given that sexuality is an important part of quality of life, it is important that health professionals actively communicate information to women and their partner about the effects of treatment on sexual wellbeing, in order to legitimate and normalise sexuality in this context. It is concluded that research in the area of gynaecological cancer and sexuality needs to acknowledge not only the physical/anatomical/material effects of cancer treatments, but also women's intrapsychic experiences of changes to sexuality, her relationship context, and the role of gendered discourses in shaping women's experiences of sexuality post-gynaecological cancer and treatment.",

A diet score that assesses the inherent characteristics of the Mediterranean diet (MedDietScore, range 0\u201355) was applied. Serum levels of UA were determined using an enzymatic colorimetric test through the uricase-peroxidase method. Hyperuricaemia was defined as UA\u00a0>\u00a07\u00a0mg/dL in males and 6\u00a0mg/dL in females.Prevalence of hyperuricaemia was 34% in males and 25% in females (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Mean level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet was 35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.

The frequency and intensity of summer heat waves will continue to increase as a result of climate change. It is important that we understand the environmental and structural factors that increase heat vulnerability, as well as examine the behaviors used by the elderly to adapt to hot indoor temperatures.From June 1 to August 31, 2009, residents in 29 homes in Detroit, MI, kept an hourly log of eight heat-adaptive behaviors: opening windows/doors, turning fans or the air conditioner on, changing clothes, taking a shower, going to the basement, the porch/yard, or leaving the house. Percentages of hourly behavior were calculated, overall and stratified by housing type and percent surface imperviousness. The frequency of behavior use, as a result of indoor and outdoor predetermined temperature intervals was compared to a reference temperature range of 21.1\u201323.8\u00a0\u00b0C.The use of all adaptive behaviors, except going to the porch or yard, was significantly associated with indoor temperature. Non-mechanical adaptations such as changing clothes, taking showers, and going outside or to the basement were rarely used. Residents living in high-rises and highly impervious areas reported a higher use of adaptive behaviors. The odds of leaving the house significantly increased as outdoor temperature increased.These findings suggest that the full range of heat adaptation measures may be underused by the elderly and public health interventions need to focus on outreach to these populations.",

     "abstract": "Calcium supplementation has been widely accepted as a key strategy in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Its role has been undermined, to some extent, by its disappointing effects on fracture in randomised controlled trials, but its use has continued to be encouraged on the grounds that it is physiologically appealing, and is unlikely to cause harm. The latter assumption is now under threat from accumulating evidence that calcium supplement use is associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction and, possibly, stroke. The latest data, based on meta-analysis of trials involving 29,000 participants, indicate that this risk is not mitigated by co-administration of vitamin D, and that the number of cardiovascular events caused is likely to be greater than the number of fractures prevented. These findings indicate that calcium supplementation probably does not have a role as a routine preventative agent and that dietary advice is the appropriate way to attain an adequate calcium intake in most situations. Patients at high risk of fracture need to take interventions of proven anti-fracture efficacy. Available evidence suggests that this efficacy is not dependent on the co-administration of calcium supplements.",

After local and hormonal treatments, a great number of patients ultimately progressed to castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), in which chemotherapy provides a small survival advantage, but with significant toxicities. In the past decade, prostate cancer has become a target for several immunotherapeutic approaches. Sipuleucel-T (Provenge\u00ae, or APC8015) is a novel cancer vaccine developed from autologous dendritic cells (DC) loaded with engineered fusion protein of prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Phase I and Phase II trials show that the vaccine is safe and effective in creating immune responses toward the fusion-protein target antigen, PAP-GM-CSF also call PA2024. Recent Phase III studies also demonstrated sipuleucel-T's efficacy in prolonging median survival in patients with CRPC, despite little or no effect on clinical disease progression or surrogates such as serum PSA kinetics. Subsequently, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved sipuleucel-T for the treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic CRPC in April 2010. Filings are projected with international regulatory agencies in 2011. While the development of sipuleucel-T provides an option for patients with early CRPC, it also introduces physicians and researchers to new unanswered questions regarding its optimal clinical use and questions about mechanism of action and combination and sequencing with other agents.",

In general, a higher incidence of PD is found among males (RR\u00a0=\u00a01.5) compared to females. However, rigidity, postural instability and levodopa-induced dyskinesia are more prevalent in females with PD. These fluctuations affect motor performance and impact functional ability. This systematic review suggests that there is minimal research literature with respect to females living with PD. Specifically, the influence of physical ability in females with PD is underemphasized, considering its contribution to functional daily living and quality of life. Three intervention and nine functional assessment studies met inclusion criteria (n\u00a0=\u00a0302; mean age\u00a0=\u00a065.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.3 years, 44% female). Reports suggest that females with PD have different gait patterns compared to \u2018healthy\u2019 age-matched females and males with PD. Females with PD experience increased freezing of gait as compared to males with PD. Dynamic balance was reduced in females compared to males with PD. Differences in cardiorespiratory fitness compared to healthy age-matched females was inconclusive. Studies were rated to be of moderate quality (20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4/32) and future studies should focus on improving sex-matched recruitment, randomized group allocation, and blinding of evaluators to ensure unbiased results.

The latter years have witnessed an increasing number of experimental and clinical studies that suggest a protective effect of chocolate against atherogenesis. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and endothelial function define three biological mechanisms that have shown sensitivity to chocolate. Moreover, the consumption of chocolate has been involved in the protective modulation of blood pressure, the lipid profile, the activation of platelets, and the sensitivity to insulin. Dark chocolate seems more protective than milk or white chocolate. Despite this array of benefits, there is a lack of well designed clinical studies demonstrating cardiovascular benefit of chocolate.

     "abstract": "Average testosterone levels and many cognitive functions show a decline with age. There is evidence to suggest that this association is not just age related. Results from cell culture and animal studies provide convincing evidence that testosterone could have protective effects on brain function. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by brain pathology affecting cognitive function and AD prevalence increases with age. Testosterone levels are lower in AD cases compared to controls, and some studies have suggested that low free testosterone (FT) may precede AD onset. Men with AD may show accelerated endocrinological ageing, characterised by an earlier lowering of thyroid stimulating hormone, an earlier increase in sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), a subsequent earlier decrease in FT and an earlier increase in gonadotropin levels in response to this. Positive associations have been found between testosterone levels and global cognition, memory, executive functions and spatial performance in observational studies. However, non-significant associations were also reported. It may be that an optimal level of testosterone exists at which some cognitive functions are improved. This may be modified with an older age, with a shifting of the optimal testosterone curve to maintain cognition to the left and a lower optimal level thus needed to be beneficial for the brain. Genetic factors, such as APOE and CAG polymorphisms may further interact with testosterone levels in their effects on cognition. The roles of SHBG, gonadotropins, thyroid hormones and estrogens in maintaining cognitive function and preventing dementia in men are also not completely understood and should be investigated further. Hypogonadal men do not seem to benefit from testosterone supplementation but small scale, short term intervention studies in eugonadal men with and without cognitive impairments have shown promising results. Larger randomised, controlled trials are needed to further investigate testosterone treatment in protecting against cognitive decline and/or dementia.",

To assess the degree of metabolic control, the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS) criteria were followed with patients under 80 years old being considered as young elderly and disability as dependence on more than 2 ADLs or need of aid in ambulation.We included 112 patients with an average age of 81.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7\u00a0years, a Charlson comorbidity index of 4.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.57 and a CIRS-G index of 9.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03. Seventy four per cent of patients were dependent on none or only one ADL, 38.5% presented cognitive impairment and 40% depression. Appropriate control of basal glucose and glycosylated haemoglobin was seen in 43.2% of the patients. HRQL indicated a high frequency of involvement with a significant relationship with functional dependence, cognitive impairment, and depression but not with metabolic control.Geriatric patients with T2DM treated on an outpatient basis have a heavy load of comorbidity and an insufficient level of metabolic control even when individually adapted to age and functional state. HRQL is greatly impaired and related to their functional, cognitive and affective derangements.",

However, there has been no study conducted to describe the cardiorespiratory fitness normative values in Chinese midlife and elderly.To provide normative values of cardiorespiratory fitness expressed as maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and its association with body composition and physical activity in Chinese midlife and elderly women in Hong Kong.659 Chinese women aged from 55 to 94 years were recruited from two existing cohorts: the carotid atherosclerosis in women Hong Kong cohort study and the Osteoporotic Fractures in Women (MsOS) Hong Kong cohort study. Symptom-limited maximal exercise testing on an electrically braked bicycle ergometer was performed to assess VO2max, where the subject was connected to a calibrated metabolic cart for gas analysis. Their body composition and physical activity data were also assessed.The body mass index was 23.4\u00a0kg/m2 and the mean fat mass and lean body mass were 16.6\u00a0kg and 37.3\u00a0kg, respectively. The mean VO2max was 20.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1\u00a0ml/kg/min (range, 7.9\u201335.7\u00a0ml/kg/min). VO2max decreased with age, with the rate of decline 0.25\u00a0ml/kg/min/yr (7.1% per decade). In a subgroup of 475 women from the MsOS study, the decline in VO2max was found to depend on ageing (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.31, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), body mass index (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.30, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and levels of physical activity (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.02, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Research shows that excess morbidity and mortality occurs during cold weather periods. We critically reviewed evidence relating temperature variability, health outcomes, and adaptation strategies to cold weather. Health outcomes included cardiovascular-, respiratory-, cerebrovascular-, and all-cause morbidity and mortality. Individual and contextual risk factors were assessed to highlight associations between individual- and neighborhood-level characteristics that contribute to a person's vulnerability to variability in cold weather events. Epidemiologic studies indicate that the populations most vulnerable to variations in cold winter weather are the elderly, rural and, generally, populations living in moderate winter climates. Fortunately, cold-related morbidity and mortality are preventable and strategies exist for protecting populations from these adverse health outcomes. We present a range of adaptation strategies that can be implemented at the individual, building, and neighborhood level to protect vulnerable populations from cold-related morbidity and mortality. The existing research justifies the need for increased outreach to individuals and communities for education on protective adaptations in cold weather. We propose that future climate change adaptation research couple building energy and thermal comfort models with epidemiological data to evaluate and quantify the impacts of adaptation strategies.",

     "abstract": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that although men tend to have better health in old age, women live longer lives. Here, we briefly review the biological, social and behavioural factors that may contribute to women's greater longevity. We consider in particular factors that might result in a greater frailty burden in women, focusing on frailty being measured by a Frailty Index. The Frailty Index represents the burden of health deficits, expressed for an individual as the proportion of deficits present \u2013 from 0 (no deficits) to 1.0 (the theoretical maximum, if all deficits were expressed).A greater frailty burden in women might first represent a male \u201cfitness\u2013frailty pleiotropy\u201d, resulting in men having lower physiological reserves in old age so that health deficits are more lethal. In short, the price of more optimal physiological functioning during youth is a lower threshold for system failure in old age. Conversely, a female \u201cfertility\u2013frailty pleiotropy\u201d might result in greater physiological reserves in women. Child birth and child rearing necessitate high levels of energetic and nutritional investment: women who have children live shorter lives. Women currently are limiting the number of children they bear and their life expectancies may be longer than predicted by evolutionary design. Third, though the Frailty Index captures physical, cognitive and psychological vulnerability, it may not include all factors that impact life expectancy in older people; these factors may be present more in men than in women. While these hypotheses seek to explain how frailty impacts men and women in different ways, there is clearly much to be done to understand frailty in older people.",

Physical performance characteristics are important to improve the physical condition of older persons and therefore may be able to prevent or delay the onset of (progressive) disability. However lack of understanding of the physiology and etiology of functional decline leading to disability causes a problem in the development of effective preventive interventions. The aim of the present review is to determine which physical performance characteristics are determinants of disability in the older general population.We searched systematically the electronic databases of PubMed (MEDLINE), CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Psychlit and Embase for cohort studies and randomized controlled trials assessing disability in the older general population. Outcomes of interest were handgrip strength, upper and lower extremity function, balance gait and physical activity. The searching strategy resulted in 22 studies included in the present systematic review.Although heterogeneity was present in the measurements of disability, consistent findings were shown for physical performance characteristics and disability. In general, a lower score of the physical performance characteristics was associated with a higher probability of (the development of) disability. The association for other aspects of gait (e.g. gait-step continuity, gait-step symmetry, path deviation and turning) and disability seems to be present, though the number of studies is limited.In the present systematic review, associations were found for hand grip strength, upper and lower body strength, gait speed, physical activity and the probability of disability.",

Excess per-capita direct costs ranged from \u20ac117 to \u20ac1873, depending on cost categories and comparison group (normal weight, non-obese). One study estimated lower lifetime health care costs given obesity. Regarding subgroups, higher costs of obesity were generally found in men, groups with higher socio-economic status (regarding costs of severe obesity), and groups with co-existing abdominal obesity, diabetes (especially type 1), elevated HbA1c (among patients with type 2 diabetes), and physical co-morbidities given BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a027 (compared to a \u201cBMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a030 only\u201d-group).

Obesity, a major health problem reaching global epidemic proportions, is also associated with morbidity and mortality.The present review provides an update on the current knowledge regarding the association of gender and obesity with stroke prevalence and outcome. We also discuss the areas that future research needs to point towards.In general, gender differences in relation to stroke are increasingly being recognized and evaluated. Age-specific stroke incidence is generally higher in men, except in the elderly. Women are treated less frequently with intravenous thrombolysis compared with men stroke patients and the two genders seem to respond differently to aspirin and statins. Regarding obesity, although it is a well-known predictor of cardiovascular disease, there is a growing body of evidence revealing the presence of an inverse relationship between obesity and outcome in patients with stroke or established cardiovascular disease, the so-called obesity paradox.Further research is warranted on these important topics, as human population is continuously aging and becoming more obese. In this context, the causes of gender differences in stroke prevalence and outcome and the obesity\u2013stroke paradox should be further investigated in future studies.",

     "abstract": "The last decades have witnessed an unprecedented rise in the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma. This rise has mainly affected men, and current male-to-female sex ratio estimates range from 7\u201310 to 1. Major risk factors for oesophageal adenocarcinoma are gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and obesity, especially in combination. The prevalence of these risk factors has increased during the last decades, but there does not seem to be a marked differential distribution among men and women. However, reflux among men is more often associated with erosive reflux disease than it is among women. There is also evidence that male-type obesity, with a prominent abdominal distribution of fat, confers a greater risk increase for oesophageal adenocarcinoma than the female equivalent. Due to the marked male predominance and the finding that women tend to develop specialized intestinal metaplasia (Barrett's oesophagus) and adenocarcinoma at a later age than men, interest has been directed towards a potential aetiological role of reproductive factors and sex hormones. Breastfeeding has been found to be a protective factor for the development of adenocarcinoma, while no association has hitherto been established with other reproductive factors. Taken together, the male predominance in the incidence of oesophageal adenocarcinoma may partly be explained by the differential effect of the major risk factors reflux disease and obesity, but the mechanisms whereby this occurs need to be elucidated. Moreover, the association with breastfeeding indicates a need for extensive epidemiological studies to clarify a possible role of sex hormonal influence in the aetiology of oesophageal adenocarcinoma.",

     "abstract": "Ageing of human skin may result from both the passage of time (intrinsic ageing) and from cumulative exposure to external influences (extrinsic ageing) such as ultraviolet radiation (UVR) which promote wrinkle formation and loss of tissue elasticity. Whilst both ageing processes are associated with phenotypic changes in cutaneous cells, the major functional manifestations of ageing occur as a consequence of structural and compositional remodeling of normally long-lived dermal extracellular matrix proteins. This review briefly considers the effects of ageing on dermal collagens and proteoglycans before focusing on the mechanisms, functional consequences and treatment of elastic fibre remodeling in ageing skin.The early stages of photoageing are characterised by the differential degradation of elastic fibre proteins and whilst the activity of extracellular matrix proteases is increased in photoexposed skin, the substrate specificity of these enzymes is low. We have recently shown however, that isolated fibrillin microfibrils are susceptible to direct degradation by physiologically attainable doses of UV-B radiation and that elastic fibre proteins as a group are highly enriched in UV-absorbing amino acid residues. Functionally, elastic fibre remodeling events may adversely impact on: the mechanical properties of tissues, the recruitment and activation of immune cells, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and cytokine signaling (by perturbing fibrillin microfibril sequestration of TGF\u03b2). Finally, newly developed topical interventions appear to be capable of regenerating elements of the elastic fibre system in ageing skin, whilst systemic treatments may potentially prevent the pathological tissue remodeling events which occur in response to elastic fibre degradation.",

Bivariate analyses showed that non-Hispanic White older adults were more likely to participate in formal volunteering activities, while their African American and Hispanic counterparts tended to participate in informal volunteering activities. Logistic regression analyses revealed that volunteering was less observed among Hispanics (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.48, 95% CI 0.29\u20130.78). Volunteering was more observed among those who reported providing informal care (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.93, 95% CI 1.14\u20133.28), having very good or excellent mental health (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.90 and 2.07, 95% CI 1.09\u20133.32 and 1.20\u20133.55, respectively), having weekly or daily spiritual participation (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.15 and 2.35, 95% CI 1.28\u20133.63 and 1.29\u20134.28, respectively), perceiving community involvement very important (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.37, 95% CI 1.55\u20133.62), and being very satisfied with the community interaction (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.81, 95% CI 1.15\u20132.85).Given the positive associations of mental health, spirituality, and social engagement with volunteering among older adults, system-level efforts to increase the sense of community among older adults and recognize their roles as volunteers will be helpful in recruiting and retaining older volunteers.",

     "abstract": "Osteoprotegerin (OPG) inhibits osteoclast function by acting as a decoy receptor for receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL), thus being an important candidate gene for osteoporosis. Three recent genome-wide association studies also identified the TNFRSF11B gene, coding for OPG, as playing a key role in bone mineral density (BMD) regulation. As variations in the TNFRSF11B gene could alter the susceptibility to osteoporosis, the aim of study was to investigate association of two TNFRSF11B gene polymorphisms with BMD and serum OPG concentration in postmenopausal women.478 postmenopausal women were genotyped for the presence of TNFRSF11B gene polymorphisms 245T\u00a0>\u00a0G (rs3134069) and 1181G\u00a0>\u00a0C (rs2073618). BMDs and serum OPG concentrations were measured.Two common haplotypes GT and CT occurred in 41.2% and 52.4% of subjects. In osteoporotic postmenopausal women, lumbar spine BMD was associated with polymorphisms 245T\u00a0>\u00a0G and 1181G\u00a0>\u00a0C, as well as with CT haplotype (p values 0.013, 0.006 and 0.006, respectively). Additionally, femoral neck BMD showed the association with 245T\u00a0>\u00a0G (p\u00a0=\u00a00.047). No other statistically significant associations with BMD were found for the studied SNPs and haplotypes. No association with serum OPG concentration was shown in any of the studied groups.Our results suggest that, in postmenopausal osteoporosis, polymorphisms 245T\u00a0>\u00a0G and 1181G\u00a0>\u00a0C, as well as haplotype CT in TNFRSF11B gene influence BMD.",

The JNHS is a nationwide prospective cohort study on the health of Japanese women, and the baseline survey was conducted between 2001 and 2007.We analyzed data for 24,153 pre- and postmenopausal women who were enrolled in the JNHS at the ages 40\u201359 years. The main outcome measure was menopause.Reproductive factors influencing the onset of natural menopause were past history of infertility [relative risk (RR) (age-adjusted odds ratio and 95% confidence interval): 1.28 (1.10\u20131.48)], past history of endometriosis: 1.32 (1.07\u20131.64), age at menarche: 0.919 (0.886\u20130.953) and number of pregnancies: 0.943 (0.911\u20130.976).

Many studies have previously shown that the elderly in a society are among the most vulnerable to heat waves.With a rapidly growing number of publications on this subject the objective was to review the recent literature for research regarding the impact of heat waves and elevated temperature on the elderly with regards to mortality and morbidity.PubMed was searched to identify studies published in English between 1st of January 2008 and 31st of December 2010 using the following key words: heat wave, mortality, morbidity, elderly and temperature. The relationship between high temperature and mortality and/or morbidity had to be studied.

Studies consistently reported increases in cardiovascular and respiratory mortality, as appeared also respiratory admissions to do during hot days and heat waves. However, the number of studies on morbidity published was much fewer. Few studies reported social, medical and environmental susceptibility factors.Future research should focus on studying susceptibilities and to non-fatal events which are not as studied as mortality.

Annual mammography screening is advised for detection of second breast cancers, and symptom-directed assessment is warranted where there is suspicion of distant recurrence or (in women using tamoxifen) of endometrial cancer. Management of menopausal symptoms, including treatment-induced premature menopause, is a key issue for many survivors, and can be challenging to manage as conventional hormone replacement therapy is contraindicated in most of these women. Specific therapeutic options for hot flushes and vaginal symptoms are discussed. The review also emphasises the need for survivorship care to include optimisation of general health, including psychosocial and sexual health, bone health and the evaluation of lifestyle-related risk factors and genetic factors. The review provides guidance on the management of many of these issues, and highlights areas requiring further evidence and research.",

     "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a common condition associated with aging but has been considered to primarily affect women because of the substantial effect of menopause on osteoporosis. Bone density can decrease with aging in men but occurs more gradually than in postmenopausal women. With improvements in healthcare and extended life expectancy, it is becoming more apparent that osteoporosis affects men and can have serious consequences. Recently, a greater number of osteoporosis studies are either including men or focusing specifically on them. The majority of medication trials in men, however, used bone density as the primary outcome rather than fractures. Therefore, treatment data for men is still rather limited, and there is also very little information in the oldest subset of this population. The more recent guidelines for treating osteoporosis now include men, but the recommendations for screening and treatment are not necessarily gender specific. Despite the limited data, some osteoporosis treatments have received approval to treat or prevent osteoporosis specifically in men. Future studies must provide greater information on fracture prevention in men and also must include a greater population of the oldest geriatric patients, who are typically not well represented in osteoporosis trials, to evaluate any differences in both efficacy and side effects. The oldest group is important because they are at the highest risk for both osteoporosis-related complications and treatment-related adverse events.",

Most recently, it has been introduced as a potential solution to support independent living of people with disabilities and older adults, as well as to relieve the workload from family caregivers and health providers. One of the key supporting features of a smart home is its ability to monitor the activities of daily living and safety of residents, and in detecting changes in their daily routines. With the availability of inexpensive low-power sensors, radios, and embedded processors, current smart homes are typically equipped with a large amount of networked sensors which collaboratively process and make deductions from the acquired data on the state of the home as well as the activities and behaviors of its residents. This article reviews sensor technology used in smart homes with a focus on direct environment sensing and infrastructure mediated sensing. The article also points out the strengths and limitations of different sensor technologies, as well as discusses challenges and opportunities from clinical, technical, and ethical perspectives. It is recommended that sensor technologies for smart homes address actual needs of all stake holders including end users, their family members and caregivers, and their doctors and therapists. More evidence on the appropriateness, usefulness, and cost benefits analysis of sensor technologies for smart homes is necessary before these sensors should be widely deployed into real-world residential settings and successfully integrated into everyday life and health care services.",

Obesity has a strong association with insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia and glucose intolerance. Adiposity, both subcutaneous and visceral, has been proposed to contribute to insulin resistance, eventually leading to T2DM. Strong evidence exists, in both genders, for the increased glucose intolerance and incidence of T2DM with increasing weight gain. Conversely, weight loss is associated with improvement of glycemic control, insulin resistance and T2DM. Bariatric surgery has risen as a therapeutic option that provides exceptional reduction in overall weight and resolution of T2DM. However, bariatric surgery serves as one component of a multifaceted weight management strategy that is required for long-term success.",

However we have provided summaries for each section.Twenty-seven studies were included in this review, of which 11 were considered high quality. The evidence suggests an association between endogenous oestrogen and cartilage turnover and radiographic OA, and between testosterone and cartilage volume. There is also evidence for an association between exogenous oestrogen and cartilage and bone turnover, although its effects on radiographic and MRI structure as well as joint replacement are unclear. The evidence also supports an association between oestrogen receptor \u03b1 and \u03b2 gene polymorphisms and OA.Although the heterogeneity of the studies means that there is insufficient evidence to form strong conclusions, the available evidence supports an effect of endogenous and exogenous oestrogen as well as oestrogen receptor polymorphisms on joint health.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the association between mood disorders and area-based socio-economic status (SES), and whether both ends of the SES continuum experienced increased odds for a mood disorder.Using a clinical interview (SCID-I/NP), psychiatric history was ascertained in a population-based sample of 1095 women (20\u201393 years) from the Barwon Statistical Division, south-eastern Australia. SES was determined by cross-referencing residential addresses with Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006 census data for the region and categorised into three groupings of low, mid, and upper SES. The Index of Economic Resources (IER), Index of Education and Occupation (IEO), and Index of Relative Socioeconomic Advantage/Disadvantage (IRSAD) were utilised.

Besides estrogen therapy, aerobic training is widely recommended for post-menopausal women, and it can decrease ambulatory BP levels. This study was designed to evaluate the effect of aerobic training and estrogen therapy on the ambulatory BP of post-menopausal women. Forty seven healthy hysterectomized women were randomly divided (in a double-blind manner) into 4 groups: placebo\u2013control (PLA\u2013CO\u00a0=\u00a012), estrogen therapy\u2013control (ET\u2013CO\u00a0=\u00a014), placebo\u2013aerobic training (PLA\u2013AT\u00a0=\u00a012), and estrogen therapy\u2013aerobic training (ET\u2013AT\u00a0=\u00a009). The ET groups received estradiol valerate (1\u00a0mg/day) and the AT groups performed cycle ergometer, 3\u00d7/week at moderate intensity. Hormonal status (blood analysis), maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (VO2 peak) and ambulatory BP (24-h, daytime and nighttime) was evaluated before and 6 months after interventions. A significant increase in VO2 peak was observed only in women who participated in aerobic training groups (+4.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0ml\u00a0kg\u22121\u00a0min\u22121, P\u00a0=\u00a00.00). Follicle-stimulating hormone was a significant decreased in the ET groups (\u221218.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.19\u00a0pg/ml, P\u00a0=\u00a00.00), and it was accompanied by an increase in circulating estrogen (56.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6\u00a0pg/ml). A significant increase was observed in the ET groups for daytime (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and nighttime systolic BP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), as well as nighttime diastolic BP (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

No significant effect was found in ambulatory heart rate.

There are no randomized trial data on the effect of transdermal estrogen on VTE. Recent observational studies and meta-analyses suggest that transdermal estrogen does not increase VTE risk. These clinical observations are supported by experimental data showing that transdermal estrogen has a minimal effect on hepatic metabolism of hemostatic proteins as the portal circulation is bypassed. A personal or family history of VTE, especially in individuals with a prothrombotic mutation, is a strong contraindication to oral HT but transdermal estrogen can be considered after careful individual evaluation of the benefits and risks. Transdermal estrogen should be also the first choice in overweight/obese women requiring HT. Observational studies suggest that micronized progesterone and dydrogesterone might have a better risk profile than other progestins with regard to VTE risk. Although these findings should be confirmed by randomized clinical trials, they strongly suggest that both the route of estrogen administration and the type of progestin may be important determinants of the overall benefit-risk profile of HT.",

Its use in breast cancer has been evaluated in several randomized controlled trials and validated in multiple prospective studies.

The technique used to perform sentinel lymph node mapping was also evaluated in multiple studies and the accuracy rate increases when radiocolloid and blue dye are used in combination. As SLNB became more accepted, contraindications were delineated and are still debated. Patients who have clinically positive lymph nodes or core biopsy-proven positive lymph nodes should not have SLNB, but should have an ALND as their staging procedure. The safety of SLNB in pregnant patients is not fully established. However, patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer and patients having neoadjuvant chemotherapy are considered candidates for SLNB. However, the details of which specific neoadjuvant patients should have SLNB are currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) benefit from SLNB when mastectomy is planned and when there is a high clinical suspicion of invasion. With the advent of SLNB, pathologic review of breast cancer lymph nodes has evolved. The significance of occult metastasis in SLNB patients is currently being debated. Additionally, the most controversial subject with regards to SLNB is determining which patients with positive SLNs benefit from further axillary dissection.",

     "abstract": "The average age of women having their first child has been rising in recent decades [1]. Since fertility declines with age, it is not surprising that larger numbers of women over 40 are seeking IVF. Any change in reproductive norms tends to generate concern. Women's apparent postponement of motherhood has met with criticism directed variously at women themselves, and at society for its failure to support women to have children at the \u2018appropriate\u2019 time. The provision of IVF to women over 40 is one facet of this broader social trend towards later reproduction.In this paper I consider a number of ethical problems that might be connected with the provision of IVF to patients over 40. I look at risks to women and offspring, and also consider questions of efficacy and cost-effectiveness. I discuss the possibility that IVF for older women could raise increase the problems associated with egg procurement. Finally I address the concept of medicalisation and suggest that as long as IVF is regarded as a medical treatment, access to it should not be used as a means of social control. Nor should it be provided or withheld on the basis of moral judgements about patients\u2019 values or lifestyles.1",

Despite a relatively high heritability of common, non-syndromic obesity (40\u201370%), the search for genetic variants contributing to susceptibility has been a challenging task. Genome wide association (GWA) studies have dramatically changed the pace of detection of common genetic susceptibility variants. To date, more than 40 genetic variants have been associated with obesity and fat distribution. However, since these variants do not fully explain the heritability of obesity, other forms of variation, such as epigenetics marks, must be considered.Epigenetic marks, or \u201cimprinting\u201d, affect gene expression without actually changing the DNA sequence. Failures in imprinting are known to cause extreme forms of obesity (e.g. Prader\u2013Willi syndrome), but have also been convincingly associated with susceptibility to obesity. Furthermore, environmental exposures during critical developmental periods can affect the profile of epigenetic marks and result in obesity.We review the most recent evidence for genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in the susceptibility and development of obesity. Only a comprehensive understanding of the underlying genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, and the metabolic processes they govern, will allow us to manage, and eventually prevent, obesity.",

While numerous physical and emotional symptoms have been attributed to it, hot flushes and night sweats (HF/NS) are the main physical change. Recent studies suggest that cognitive factors, particularly beliefs about other people's reactions to their HF/NS, might increase distress, causing embarrassment and behavioural avoidance. Younger men and women tend to have more negative attitudes to menopause but research is needed to establish whether menopausal women's beliefs are grounded in evidence or are overly negative cognitions.290 men and women (aged 25\u201345 years) participated in a questionnaire survey, including both qualitative and quantitative data. Participants answered open-ended questions about their attributions and reactions to a hypothetical scenario of a woman displaying hot flush symptoms and completed a modified version of the Menopause Representations Questionnaire (MRQ) to assess beliefs about menopause.A wide range of attributions and responses were evident. The majority of participants did not attribute redness and sweating to the menopause; similarly mainly neutral and positive responses were expressed. However, this younger sample had significantly more negative beliefs about menopause (MRQ) compared to a sample of menopausal women and women identified more symptoms as being due to the menopause than men. No age differences were evident.These findings suggest that women's beliefs about \u2018other people's\u2019 reactions are unduly negative. This evidence can be used in cognitive behavioural interventions to help women to challenge these beliefs and behaviours that exacerbate distress.",

An interview-administered questionnaire was used to obtain information on duration and intensity of recreational physical activity during five years preceding study recruitment. Mammograms were evaluated according to BIRADS classification and BIRADS score was also estimated. Multivariate ordinal logistic regression analysis was used to assess associations between physical activity index and breast density according to the BIRADS classification methods.We observed a statistically significant inverse association of mammographic breast density measured by the BIRADS classification method and recreational exercise (OR\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.10; 95% CI \u22120.018, \u22120.001; p\u00a0=\u00a00.022). For one unit increase in physical activity as expressed by the MET-h/week score, the odds of lower versus higher breast density categories are 1.105 greater, given that all of the other variables in the model are held constant. A modifying effect by age at recruitment was evident among participants, with a stronger inverse association between recreational activity and mammographic breast density among older women (OR\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.036; 95% CI \u22120.063, \u22120.009; p\u00a0=\u00a00.009).

Increasing physical activity levels among postmenopausal women might be a reasonable approach to reduce mammographic density. However, until more physical activity and mammographic breast density studies are conducted that confirm our findings, they have to be interpreted with caution, due to the retrospective nature of our data and the possibility of memory bias.",

Only the lumbar spine (L2\u2013L4) BMD, not the femoral neck BMD, was positively associated with the trunk FM. Positive trends for association were revealed between the spinal BMD and the trunk FM regardless of the use of HRT. Adjustments did not change the results.Higher trunk fat mass was associated with the spinal BMD, but not with the hip BMD in postmenopausal women, irrespective of the HRT use. In addition to biological factors, uncertainties related to DXA measurements in patients with varying body mass may contribute to this phenomenon.",

     "abstract": "The \u2018stem cell burden\u2019 hypothesis represents a plausible explanation for the association between birth-weight and the risk of breast cancer in adulthood. The size of the overall stem cell pool would be expected to affect organ size and consequently birth-weight, making birth-weight a proxy for the overall number of fetal stem cells. As stem cells are self-renewing, the greater their number is at birth, the higher will be the chance that one of them will undergo carcinogenesis over the years. To investigate the correlation between birth-weight and stem cell burden, we examined the cord blood hematopoietic CD34+ stem cell population as an indicator of the overall fetal stem cell number. We measured both the CD34+ level (by flow cytometry) and the CD34+ proliferative potential (by the GM-CFU culture), in a sample of 1037 healthy newborn cord blood donors. We found that heavier babies had a significantly greater CD34+ stem cell concentration (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a higher GM-CFU number than lighter babies (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Thus, a high birth-weight was positively associated with a high concentration of CD34+ stem cells and also with a qualitatively higher \u201cstemness\u201d of this pool. Therefore, our data support the theory that birth-weight reflects the number of fetal stem cells.",

Lycopene, a carotenoid found in tomatoes, is an antioxidant with a protective effect on lipid peroxidation and anti-atherosclerotic capacity. This review summarises current evidence on the effect of lycopene on serum lipid concentrations and blood pressure.We searched the PubMed and Cochrane databases for intervention studies between 1955 and September 2010 investigating the effect of lycopene on blood lipids or blood pressure for a minimum duration of 2 weeks. We conducted meta-analyses using a random effect model of all studies fitting the inclusion criteria. Additionally, we conducted subgroup meta-analysis of serum lipid concentrations by lycopene dosage and subgroup meta-analysis by baseline blood pressure.Twelve studies (13 trial arms) meeting the inclusion criteria investigated the effect of lycopene on serum lipids, and four studies examined its effect on blood pressure. Meta-analysis on serum lipids revealed a significant cholesterol-lowering effect of lycopene for total serum cholesterol (mean change\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE: \u22127.55\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.15\u00a0mg/dl; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mean change\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE: \u221210.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.64\u00a0mg/dl, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0003) in the subgroup of trials using lycopene dosages of \u226525\u00a0mg daily, whereas subgroup meta-analysis of trials using lower lycopene dosages was not significant.

More research is needed to confirm suggested beneficial effects on total serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure.",

     "abstract": "The treatment of older adults with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) poses special challenges for the clinician. Older adults are more likely to have decreased functional reserve which might limit their ability to undergo surgery or receive chemotherapy. Additionally, age is associated with increased number of co-morbid medical conditions that could be exacerbated by treatment and could predispose to poor outcome. It is unclear how these propensities affect the efficacy and safety of therapy in older patients with NSCLC, as the elderly are an understudied population and there are limited data in older adults in most trials evaluating therapy in lung cancer. As the number of trials of older adults increases, however, it is becoming more evident that age alone cannot be used as a surrogate for poor outcome. Various studies have shown that older adults are able to benefit from surgery or chemotherapy when correct patient selection is used. Most chemotherapeutic regimens have similar efficacy in older and younger patients, and while some toxicity rates are higher in older patients, with appropriate prophylaxis and supportive care older adults are generally able to tolerate most chemotherapy regimens, even in combinations. Proper selection of candidates for aggressive therapy is important, and identification of issues that might limit ability to complete treatment or benefit from treatment is essential, and can be accomplished through the use of a comprehensive geriatric assessment. This article serves as a review of the available evidence in the evaluation, treatment, and support of the older adult with cancer.",

However, a multitude of changes in the immune system occurring with advancing age, termed immunosenescence, lead to limit the protective effects of vaccination in older adults. While it is widely believed that the current immunization strategies saves many lives, vaccine preventable infectious diseases (VPDs) still place a considerable burden, not only on older individuals, but also on the adult population and healthcare systems of developed countries. This review will first examine the evidence linking the contribution of immunosenescence to a less than optimal vaccine response in aged individuals in order to demonstrate that strategy of promoting vaccination in these populations is not sufficient to reduce the burden associated with VPDs. Furthermore, based upon the side effects of the herd immunity when vaccine-policies are mainly childhood-centered, considerations will be given on the imperative necessity to frame shift our thinking and efforts away from a nearly complete childhood-centered vaccine programme toward a life-span immunization programmes.",

This decline in muscle mass, known as sarcopenia, is frequently observed in postmenopausal women. Potential causes of sarcopenia include age-related changes in the hormonal status, low levels of physical activity, reduced protein intake and increased oxidative stress. However, the role of sex hormones, specifically estrogens, on the onset of sarcopenia is controversial. Preventing sarcopenia and preserving muscle strength are highly relevant in order to prevent functional impairment and physical disability. To date, resistance training has been shown to be effective in attenuating age-related muscle loss and strength. However, results on the effect of hormonal supplementation to treat or prevent sarcopenia are contradictory. Further research is needed to identify other potential mechanisms of sarcopenia as well as effective interventions for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia. Therefore, the purpose of this review will be to examine the role of sex hormonal status in the development of sarcopenia. We will also overview the physical as well as metabolic consequences of sarcopenia and the efficiency of different interventions for the prevention and treatment of sarcopenia.",

The aim of this study was to summarise the evidence from systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses assessing the efficacy of acupuncture in treating common gynaecologic conditions. Six electronic databases, including two major English-language databases (PubMed and the Cochrane Library) and four Korean databases, were systematically searched for SRs and meta-analyses concerned with acupuncture and common gynaecologic diseases. The following English search terms were used: (gynaecologic disease in MeSH terms) AND (acupuncture or acup*) AND (systematic review OR meta-analysis). In addition, three Korean traditional medicine journals (The Journal of the Korean Acupuncture and Moxibustion Society, The Journal of Korean Oriental Medicine and The Journal of Oriental Obstetrics and Gynaecology) were searched. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Overview Quality Assessment Questionnaire. Of the 55 potentially relevant studies that were found, 16 SRs were included in this report. These reviews evaluated the efficacy of acupuncture for treating the side effects of breast cancer chemotherapy, menstrual disturbances, menopausal symptoms, female infertility, uterine fibroids and polycystic ovary syndrome. Acupuncture was clearly beneficial in the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In addition, current evidence suggests that acupuncture administered close to embryo transfer during in vitro fertilisation treatment improves the rates of pregnancy and live birth. In conclusion, there is no convincing evidence of the efficacy of acupuncture except for specific conditions, which include acupuncture administered with embryo transfer to improve the outcome of in vitro fertilisation and acupuncture for the management of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. More well-designed trials using rigorous methodology are required to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture in treating gynaecologic conditions.",

     "abstract": "\u201cIt is health that is real wealth and not pieces of gold and silver.\u201d Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869\u20131948).With the current demographic shift being experienced by populations globally, almost linear increases in life expectancy have been seen and can be expected. However, increases in healthy life expectancy may not keep pace. Among older populations the proportion of time spent in less than full health tends to increase. As a result, the accurate valuation of life spent in states less than full health will become increasingly important. Different techniques and approaches have been used to measure health in populations. The use of summary measures of population health such as DALYs (Disability Adjusted Life Years) has become common, and is widely used to compare health between populations and to evaluate the potential impact of interventions in economic analyses. Most of the commonly used summary measures of health express some measure of life lived in full health and life lived with disability or in a state of sub-optimal health. Critical to the construction of summary health measures are values assigned to health states. Current tools used in determining these values include the standard gamble, time trade off, person trade off, and the visual analogue scale. However, these techniques all have the disadvantage of incorporating individual biases (derived from particular characteristics specific to individuals or populations) into the process through which health state valuations are derived. As a consequence health states are often not directly comparable between populations, since characteristics such as nationality and ethnicity can influence how health states are valued. Furthermore, health can be judged differently by those of different ages, with the young often assigning a lower value to life lived at less than full health compared to older people.The challenge of obtaining opinions which are not influenced by an individual's own circumstances is not new. This issue was encountered and described by the American philosopher John Rawls in \u2018A Theory of Justice\u2019 (1971), in which he employed a thought experiment called \u2018the veil of ignorance\u2019 as a means of overcoming this problem. In this thought experiment an individual is asked to make decisions about distributive justice by imagining they are behind a \u2018veil of ignorance\u2019, whereby they are unaware of their own position in society.Here we discuss how current methods for deriving health state values may incorporate a veil of ignorance approach, and how this may benefit the comparability of the health state valuations produced. We also propose how such methods may be operationalised.Considering these issues, we propose that a new society with new needs and a progressively growing interest in maintaining adequate health requires appropriate measures of health. These measures should facilitate derivation of objective measures of health that are comparable to those acquired in other populations, irrespective of age, gender, disease status, ethnicity and geographical location. Promoting and improving health demands adequate measures of health and the application of the Rawlsian veil of ignorance approach could be an effective alternative.",

     "abstract": "The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors which has been suggested to have a possible effect on bone mass. Somewhat paradoxically, it is not clear whether this effect is protective or detrimental. Some of its components (e.g., obesity) seem to have the first type of effect and others (e.g., glucose metabolism changes) the second one. The epidemiological studies are not conclusive. Five out of six cross-sectional studies show no differences in the rate of fractures between subjects with or without MetS. In the sixth, fewer fractures were observed in patients with the syndrome. Two of three prospective studies also found fewer fractures, but the third more. Regarding the relationship of each individual component of MetS with fractures, the results \u2013 apart from obesity \u2013 are scarce or inconsistent. The relationship between MetS and bone mineral density (BMD) or bone turnover markers (BTMs) has also been addressed. Without adjusting for BMI, six out of nine studies have shown higher BMD values in MetS patients and the rest no differences. This positive effect on BMD is mainly driven by BMI, and therefore disappears after adjusting for it. The fasting plasma glucose level has been shown in general to be positively associated with BMD. Hypertension and hypertriglyceridemia showed variable results, while BTMs are decreased in MetS. Finally, there is no definite evidence about the existence of gender differences in the effect of MetS on bone. In conclusion, MetS tends to be positively associated with BMD and negatively with BTMs. No clear-cut data about fractures are available.",

Sleep problems increase with age in both sexes, but women are more susceptible to them at all ages. Although menopause is considered an important milestone (the decrease in both oestrogen and progesterone has been shown to reduce sleep quality), an increase in sleep problems is already evident in midlife, as there is an increased incidence of other diseases as well as mood symptoms, which may exert an effect on sleep quality either directly or via the side-effects of the associated medications. Weight changes at midlife and the menopause may also affect sleep quality. In addition to reductions in sleep quality, specific sleep disorders, like sleep-disordered breathing and restless legs syndrome, become more prevalent in midlife and especially after menopause. Because sleep problems are commonly present in association with other conditions, rather than as isolated, independent disorders, treatment is often complex and patients generally need multiprofessional appraisal.",

Two major mechanisms have been referred to as the reason for gender differences in career paths for physicians. The major theoretical framework tends to be the socialization or sex-role theory and later versions of this explanatory framework. The other mechanism referred to is structural and points to the barriers or the concrete support that women and men experience in making their career decisions. Studies of medical students in the UK and US have shown that women students expected family demands to hamper career plans, while male students were less influenced by family concerns. The importance of role models and mentors in setting the career goals of medical students and residents has recently confirmed early studies of the topic. A number of studies have documented that early negative experiences or lack of encouragement in medical school deter women from choosing surgery as a career.

The MedDietScore was additionally indirectly calculated from participants\u2019 76-item FFQ and 36-item FFQ answers. To test the a posterior approach, principal-components analysis (PCA) was used to derive dietary patterns.

In addition, PCA using the 50 food items revealed three major dietary patterns that were similar in both administrations, explaining 23% and 25% of the dietary intake variability, respectively, while PCA using 12 food groups also revealed three similar patterns between the two administrations (explaining 43% and 46% of the dietary intake variability, respectively).The results indicate the short-term stability of dietary patterns derived using either a priori or a posterior methods.

Around three-quarters of breast cancers express the estrogen receptor and are therefore presumed to be hormone-responsive and potentially treatable or preventable by anti-estrogenic agents. Expression of the HER2 receptor occurs in a fifth of breast cancers and is associated with limited endocrine response in hormone receptor-positive tumours and directs treatment with HER2-targeted agents. Despite improvements in the clinical outcome of breast cancer patients through the development of endocrine and targeted agents, overcoming de novo or acquired resistance remains a considerable therapeutic hurdle. In addition, as our understanding of the complexity of breast cancer biology increases, it is clear that existing therapies will fall short of offering an effective treatment solution to many patients. The ability to profile molecular pathways in drug-responsive and drug-resistant tumours has provided an important step in identifying novel targets in breast cancer. To this end, a number of new targeted therapeutics are currently being investigated both as single agents and as a means to improve existing therapeutic regimens.",

It seems likely that these observations may be, at least partially explained, through changes in stem cell number and function. After menopause, despite very low systemic oestradiol levels, intra-breast oestradiol concentrations remain high due to increased biosynthesis of oestrogens in breast fat and stromal tissue. Stem cells are usually tightly regulated within a niche. The malignant process seems to involve changes in not only the cancer stem cell but also its microenvironment.

Fortunately, generally safe and effect therapy is available. Although once considered non-controversial, there is some concern about calcium supplementation, but all studies of osteoporosis therapy in men have included calcium. In most older men, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are likely to be low, although again there is controversy about the ideal level. Many experts believe that all older men, including those on ADT, need to have a level of >30\u00a0ng/ml, which is easily accomplished. Bone mineral density (BMD) testing by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is indicated for men on ADT. Interestingly, forearm DXA may be particularly important in ADT men, in addition to spine and hip. Some experts have suggested that men on ADT with a T-score of \u2264\u22121.5 should be treated. Alternatively FRAX or another risk calculator can be used. Oral and intravenous bisphosphonates are FDA approved treatments for men with osteoporosis and increase BMD in men on ADT.

Women with PMB have around a 10% chance of having endometrial carcinoma and therefore PMB always needs further evaluation.

Four types of diagnostic test are described: sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness, endometrial sampling, hysteroscopy and saline infusion sonography. All four have been independently shown to be accurate in excluding endometrial cancer. However, neither in systematic reviews nor in international guidelines is consensus found regarding the sequence in which these methods should be employed in women with PMB. For measurement of endometrial thickness in symptomatic women, a cut-off value of 3\u00a0mm is recommended, but the cost-effectiveness of this strategy has yet to be shown. Research should now focus on the incorporation of individual patient characteristics and pre-test probabilities for cancer in algorithms for the investigation of PMB, and the most cost-effective sequenced combination of the four types of test.",

     "abstract": "Estrogens, and in particular 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), play a pivotal role in sexual development and reproduction and are also implicated in a large number of physiological processes including the cardiovascular system. Although epidemiological studies and Nurses\u2019 Health Study suggested, and all animal models of early atheroma clearly demonstrated a vasculoprotective action of both endogenous and exogenous estrogens, the Women's Health Initiative did not confirm the preventive action of estrogens against coronary heart disease (CHD). However, women who initiated hormone therapy closer to menopause tended to have reduced CHD risk compared with increased CHD risk among women more distant from menopause. Thus, it is now mandatory to try to understand the mechanisms that could have influenced the actions of estrogens at various stages of atherosclerosis and/or of life. In this current review, we will summarize our understanding of the potential cellular targets and mechanisms of the vasculoprotective actions of estrogens, as well as of the lack of action of estrogens when administered after a period of hormonal deprivation. The mechanisms of the aggravating role of progestogens such as medroxyprogesterone acetate will be considered. Finally, we will analyze the possibilities to uncouple some beneficial from other undesirable actions following the partial/selective activation of estrogen receptors.",

A postal questionnaire containing items about demographics, lifestyle behaviours, weight, height, menopausal status, frequency of hot flushes/night sweats and preferences for exercise was sent to all eligible women.1693/2776 (61.0%) of women replied. The majority (75.9%) of respondents stated that exercise was an acceptable intervention. The most commonly chosen option for delivery of exercise interventions was by one-to-one consultations with a fitness advisor, followed by DVD sent by post. Telephone based interventions and e-Health interventions (i.e. Internet and mobile phone text messages) were the interventions least chosen. There was also an overwhelming choice for walking as a mode of exercise. A series of two factor analyses of covariance indicated exercise participation and BMI were not significantly related to frequency of hot flushes/night sweats in symptomatic menopausal women.Menopausal women have strong preferences to receive exercise interventions that involve one-to-one contact with a fitness advisor or by exercise DVD. The use of more recent technology to deliver exercise interventions was highly unpopular. These findings should be considered in future studies when planning exercise interventions with this population.",

Specific diagnosis of presumed histology of the lesion using gray-scale ultrasound findings was provided based on examiner's impression. Definitive diagnosis was obtained in all cases. Sensitivity and specificity for each diagnosis were calculated in both pre and postmenopausal women. Specificity for malignant tumors was significantly higher in premenopausal women (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

The aim of this systematic review is two fold. We aim to describe older men's knowledge about the osteoporosis disease process, risk factors, and prevention. Second, we examine educational interventions designed to increase older men's knowledge about osteoporosis.Computerized literature searches were performed with multiple databases including Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, MEDLINE, SocINDEX, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. Studies were considered if they included men aged 50 years or older, included a measure of osteoporosis knowledge and/or had an intervention designed to change osteoporosis knowledge and/or lifestyle risk factors for osteoporosis.Thirteen studies were included in the review. Nine of the studies were cross-sectional studies on men's knowledge of osteoporosis. All of the studies found that men have minimal knowledge of the osteoporosis disease process, risk factors, and prevention. Four studies focused on education about osteoporosis. Educational interventions were found to increase initiation of calcium supplementation and knowledge about osteoporosis prevention.Older men know remarkably little about the osteoporosis disease process, risk factors for the disease, or prevention. Education has the potential to improve this situation. Unfortunately, so few clinical trials have occurred that the best method for improving men's knowledge cannot be stated. Future studies examining knowledge and education of osteoporosis for men need to use validated instruments with a focus on risk factors pertinent to men.",

According to the 2003 Rotterdam criteria, two additional phenotypes are recognized: (1) the ovulatory patient with androgen excess and polycystic ovarian morphology and (2) the anovulatory patient with polycystic ovarian morphology without androgen excess. PCOS is associated with an adverse cardiometabolic profile, consisting of increased total or central adiposity, increased blood pressure, a pro-atherogenic lipid profile, increased inflammatory markers, insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism. Furthermore, the incidence of overt or gestational diabetes mellitus, as well as of preeclampsia is significantly higher in PCOS patients. Among the various PCOS phenotypes, those with evidence of androgen excess have the highest burden of cardiovascular risk. Studies evaluating the incidence of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women with PCOS are extremely sparse. The available data so far indicate that coronary heart disease, as well as cerebrovascular disease is more common in postmenopausal PCOS patients. Persisting high androgen levels through the menopause, obesity and maturity onset diabetes mellitus are proposed as the main mechanisms accounting for the increased risk.",

     "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common neurological disorders. It affects mainly women. This autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by intermittent or chronic damage to the myelin sheaths (demyelination), focal inflammation and axonal degeneration. During the early relapsing/remitting stages of MS, myelin can regenerate, but as the disease progresses the remyelination of axons becomes insufficient, leading to impaired axon conduction, neurodegeneration and the worsening of symptoms. The present pharmacological treatment of MS is limited to the administration of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory drugs, which are only palliative and do not significantly slow progress of the disease. What are needed are agents that target different cell types in the CNS to protect axonal networks and stimulate the endogenous capacity of myelin repair. Estrogens and progestins may be the basis for such a new therapeutic approach. Although clinical observations provide only indirect or insufficient evidence for an influence of sex steroids on the progress of MS, experimental studies have shown that estrogens and progestins exert multiple beneficial effects in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a widely used MS disease model. Moreover, both types of hormones have been shown to promote the viability of neurons and the formation of myelin. These promising experimental results should encourage the launch of prospective clinical studies to clarify the influence of hormones on the course of MS and the effect of hormone treatments, in particular those presently used in contraception and hormone replacement therapy (HRT).",

Such mixtures being freely accessible and escaping thereby medical survey, they could exert unwanted effects, depending on their qualitative and quantitative composition as well as the physiopathological status of the women. This work outlines the necessity to inform consumers of the exact nature of these PEs preparations.

MEDLINE was searched for reports published between January 1, 1990 and August 6, 2010 and additional studies were identified through searches of bibliographies. 9156 abstracts and 93 articles were reviewed to identify empirical studies of women with physical disability who were 45 years or older and that reported CVD or osteoporosis as an outcome and not a cause of the disability. Articles meeting inclusion criteria were then critically appraised to exclude poor quality studies. In seven articles that evaluated CVD outcomes, we found limited evidence to support an increased risk of prevalence of CVD or risk factors for CVD in women aging with physical disabilities compared to non-disabled control populations. The literature is limited by small sample sizes that reduced statistical power to detect true differences. No articles meeting inclusion criteria were identified to evaluate osteoporosis risk in this group. This review is limited by the narrow focus on physical disabilities and two health outcomes. Additional high quality empirical research is necessary to understand the risks to health of women aging with disabilities.",

The reason is still unclear but the protective effects of estrogens have been suggested.To formulate a position statement on the management of menopause women in the context of coronary heart disease.Literature review and consensus of expert opinion.Based on long term randomized placebo-controlled studies hormone therapy (HT) is not recommended for the primary or secondary prevention of CHD in postmenopausal women. In most countries the only indication for HT is the treatment of menopausal symptoms. Women with known CHD or with many coronary risk factors seeking HT because of troublesome climacteric symptoms should be evaluated for their individual baseline risk of developing breast cancer, venous thromboembolism and CHD recurrence. The same applies to non hormone therapy-based treatments where long term clinical studies are lacking. Risks should be weighed against expected benefit from symptom relief and improved quality of life. The lowest effective estrogen dose should be used during the shortest possible time. Transdermal administration is preferred if risk factors for VTE exist. Different progestogens might differ in their cardiovascular effects. Observational studies suggest that micronized progesterone or dydrogesterone may have a better risk profile than other progestogens with regard to thrombotic risk.",

Certain medications and natural supplements taken or prescribed to alleviate tamoxifen-induced hot flashes and depressive states in women with breast cancer interact with tamoxifen. This paper reviews potentially problematic interactions and offers treatment recommendations.Medline (1950-June 1, 2010), Embase Classic\u00a0+\u00a0Embase (1947-June 1, 2010) and PsycINFO (1967-June 1, 2010) were searched through Ovid.

Gabapentin is also efficacious in treating tamoxifen-induced hot flashes and, since it does not interact with cytochrome P450 system, is likely safe to use in patients using tamoxifen. Desvenlafaxine and pregabalin may be alternatives to venlafaxine and gabapentin, respectively, although desvenlafaxine has not yet been studied in this population. Paroxetine, fluoxetine and bupropion are strong CYP2D6 inhibitors which should be avoided in tamoxifen users. Fluvoxamine and nefazodone both inhibit CYP3A, which could potentially affect the metabolism of tamoxifen. Clonidine can be an alternative agent but may carry significant side effects. Evidence of medicinal products for the treatment of tamoxifen-induced hot flashes is equivocal at best.Clinicians should remain cautious about using strong inhibitors and/or inducers of cytochrome 2D6 and 3A4 concomitantly with tamoxifen. Use of natural menopausal supplements and diets rich in isoflavones should not be encouraged in tamoxifen users until more data is available. There are however safe treatments for hot flashes and depression in tamoxifen users.",

The purpose of this review is to summarise current literature and describe trends in the use of pelvic floor muscle exercise in the management of urinary incontinence in women.Our review confirms that pelvic floor muscle exercise is particularly beneficial in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence in females. Studies have shown up to 70% improvement in symptoms of stress incontinence following appropriately performed pelvic floor exercise. This improvement is evident across all age groups. There is evidence that women perform better with exercise regimes supervised by specialist physiotherapists or continence nurses, as opposed to unsupervised or leaflet-based care.There is evidence for the widespread recommendation that pelvic floor muscle exercise helps women with all types of urinary incontinence. However, the treatment is most beneficial in women with stress urinary incontinence alone, and who participate in a supervised pelvic floor muscle training programme for at least three months.",

     "abstract": "The higher risk of women developing autoimmune diseases suggests that immune system is mediated by sex steroids.To review the effects of aging and menopause in immune system.A systematic review of in vitro, animal and human studies involving aging and menopause and immune system was carried out. An electronic search based on Internet search engines, MEDLINE (1966\u2013June 2010) and the Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trials Register was done.After crossing-cleaning the reference lists, a total of 688 studies dealing with immune system and menopause were identified. Of them, 30 were considered selectable. The concept of immunosenescence reflects changes in both cellular and serological immune responses throughout the process of generating specific response to foreign antigens. This may be related with a higher incidence of infectious and chronic diseases. After menopause, there is an increase in pro-inflammatory serum markers (IL1, IL6, TNF-alpha), an increase in response of the immune blood cells to these cytokines, a decrease in CD4 T and B lymphocytes and a decrease in the cytotoxic activity of NK cells. Additionally, IL-6 is a key factor in bone resorption and also seems to be associated with other diseases more common after menopause such as diabetes, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Most of the studies suggested that in addition to age, in postmenopausal women, changes of the immune system have been attributed to estrogen deprivation. Furthermore, recent studies point out changes in immune response related to use or cessation of hormone replacement at menopause.",

It is therefore likely that fracture risk models, which take into account this fluctuation of fracture risk over time, will be more relevant in predicting an individual's subsequent fracture risk.

Although influenced largely by genetic factors, body mass index (BMI) is also heavily dependent upon environmental (principally dietary) factors. Whilst bariatric surgery often results in weight loss, its associated cost is prohibitive for widespread application. Current options for medical treatment of obesity are limited by recent withdrawals of Rimonabant and Sibutramine, enhancing the need for further development of novel weight-loss drugs.The incretin effect results from release of the incretin hormones Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) from intestinal cells in response to glucose ingestion. This in turn has direct effects on the endocrine pancreas to enhance insulin release in a glucose-dependent manner and suppress glucagon release, the net effects of which are to reduce post-prandial excursions of plasma glucose. Administration of novel GLP-1-mimetic therapies to patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) has been shown to improve and stabilise glycaemic control. In addition, such treatment often leads to substantial and sustained weight loss through pleiotropic effects. These include primary central suppressive effects on hypothalamic appetite control and secondary central effects including inhibition of gastric emptying inducing a feeling of fullness during meals. Although not currently licensed for use as weight-loss therapies, application of GLP-1-mimetic drugs for such a purpose would seem to offer great potential, and should be a focus for further research including a full assessment of safety issues.",

Research suggests that women and men may be equally likely to prefer home-based to hospital-based CR services. Women's preferences for and outcomes in, women-only CR are beginning to be uncovered. Discussing program model options with female cardiac patients and referring to preferred types may be the appropriate approach until further evidence is available.",

     "abstract": "Endocrine therapy in the setting of breast cancer has undoubtedly advanced clinical outcomes in this disease, but treatment with endocrine therapy is accompanied by a wide spectrum of side effects. It is of prime importance to understand and characterize these toxicities to facilitate clinical decision-making. Somewhat surprisingly, there is a relative paucity of data pertaining to cognitive changes associated with endocrine therapy. In this article we review cognitive associated with two classes of endocrine therapy: (1) selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs; tamoxifen and raloxifene) and (2) aromatase inhibitors (AIs; anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane). Companion studies to the Multiple Outcome of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE), the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) and National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) P-1 trials provide relevant data to understand the effect of SERMs on cognition. In contrast, substudies of the Arimidex, Tamoxifen Alone or in Combination (ATAC), Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) and Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trials juxtapose cognitive effects of AIs against those of tamoxifen. These and other studies are examined herein to provide a comprehensive overview of the effect of endocrine therapy on cognition.",

     "abstract": "The primitive breast develops in utero and during infancy breast growth largely parallels the growth of the child. At puberty, the GnRH pulse generator starts up, initially with just 1\u20132 pulses daily. This results in very small amounts of unopposed estrogen being secreted by the ovary. As the GnRH pulse generator matures, ovarian secretion of estrogen increases. The pubertal breast responds to this increasing estrogen drive. Breast glandular increase in size is mostly due to growth and division of the primary ducts. Eventually, the terminal buds give rise alveolar buds which tend to cluster around a terminal duct. Lobule formation begins in the first 2 years that follow menarche. With the onset of ovulation, breast mitotic activity increases and is usually maximal in the luteal phase. The final stage of breast maturation occurs during the first full-term pregnancy. The breast undergoes marked changes in preparation for breast feeding. There is evidence that breast SC number decreases during that first pregnancy. Also, the remaining SC undergo significant change which seems to render them less likely to undergo malignant change. These alterations to breast SC number and function may explain, at least in part, why early first pregnancy reduces the risk of breast cancer later in life.",

Experimental models have used endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, isolated arteries, and live animals, including monkeys. The clinical evidence arises from studies on the lipid profile and lipid oxidation, insulin resistance, hemostasis, changes in the inflammatory factors, and indicators of endothelial function, including metabolites of nitric oxide and prostacyclin. There are not randomized trials investigating the action of isoflavones on the incidence of clinical episodes, but a few recent, well-designed studies have suggested the association of the ingestion of isoflavones with a reduction in the atherosclerotic burden, as indicated by the measurement of the intima-media thickness in carotid vessels.",

Thirty-nine percent of the postmenopausal women had experienced vaginal atrophy, with the prevalence varying between countries, from 34% in Canada to 43% in Finland and the United States. Attitudes towards symptoms also varied between countries. Symptoms were described as moderate or severe by less than half of women from Finland and Sweden, compared with nearly two-thirds of women from the United States. However, vaginal atrophy was deemed to impact on quality of life by a higher proportion of women in Finland and Sweden (\u226560%) than in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada (\u226450%). Overall, 77% of respondents believed women were uncomfortable discussing vaginal atrophy and 42% did not know that local treatment was available. The proportions of women unaware of the availability of local treatment were higher in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada (51%, 50% and 48%, respectively), and very low in Finland (10%). Whilst 63% of women who had experienced vaginal atrophy had never been prescribed treatment for the condition, 67% of those who had been treated reported positive effects.The survey results illustrate differing needs of menopausal women in different countries.

The final study population consisted of 1462 women. Participants completed a self-administered multidimensional questionnaire. In addition to the study exposure (age at menarche) and outcome (age at menopause) variables, the following independent variables were selected: parity; schooling; self-classified race; use of oral contraceptives; smoking; and body mass index (BMI). Median ages at natural menopause and the survival curves were estimated by the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. To estimate the association between age at menarche and age at natural menopause, a Cox semi-parametric model was fitted. Women who were still menstruating, who had undergone surgery for the removal of the uterus or ovaries, or who were in perimenopause were censored.Natural menopause occurred in 205 women. The median and mode for natural menopause were 51.7 and 50 years of age, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, no statistically significant association was observed between age at menarche and age at menopause (HR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.93\u20131.11).In the current study, the hypothesis of an association between age at menarche and age at natural menopause was not confirmed.

Because of this, a number of studies have been conducted to address the question of whether cardiovascular diseases can be modulated by antioxidant treatment or consumption. Although some of the earliest data, collected in animal studies and epidemiologic studies have shown a measure of success, numerous clinical trials indicate that this approach is of minimal or no benefit. These conclusions represent a challenge to design more sensitive antioxidant trials in order to confirm or alter these conclusions.

     "abstract": "Psychological attitudes are prospectively related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), but a causal relationship has not been demonstrated. Trait optimism/pessimism (positive or negative future expectation, respectively), and cynical hostility (mistrust of people), are attitudes with features of personality traits. These attitudes may affect CVD risk in several ways, by influencing an individual's (1) adoption of health behaviors, (2) maladaptive stress responding resulting in direct alteration of physiology (i.e., autonomic dysfunction, thrombosis, arrhythmias), (3) development of traditional CVD risk factors, and (4) lack of adherence to therapy in both primary and secondary prevention. More adaptive attitudes may favorably influence CVD risk at each of these critical junctures. The genetic and environmental (i.e., social, economic, racial/ethnic) determinants of attitudes have not been extensively studied. In addition, it is important to understand how some of these environmental determinants may also moderate the association between attitudes and CVD. Clinical trials to modify attitudes for CVD risk reduction (either by reducing negative attitudes or by increasing positive attitudes) are difficult to conduct, but are necessary to determine whether attitudes can indeed be modified, and if, so, to quantify any CVD-related benefits. To address these questions we present a broad, multidisciplinary research agenda utilizing mixed methods and integrating principles of epidemiology, genetics, psychophysiology, and behavioral medicine over the lifecourse (first figure). This overview focuses on attitudes and CVD, but has broader implications for understanding how psychological factors relate to chronic diseases of adulthood.",

     "abstract": "Like other organs, the breast contains rare somatic stem cells (SCs) that are long-lived and slowly dividing. In the adult breast, they are closely regulated in areas located along the breast ducts called SC niches. Breast SCs can produce offspring that become ductal, alveoli or myoepithelial cells. In fetal life, SCs form the primitive breast ducts and up to 30 weeks of gestational age, this process appears to be largely independent of estrogen. Early life risk factors for breast cancer include birth weight, rapid growth during infancy and diet. The impact of these risk factors may be mediated through SC number. These somatic breast SCs persist into adult life and so they are exposed to oncogenic influences for much longer than the short-lived differentiated breast ductal and alveolar cells. As such, it is likely that the breast SC is a prominent target for carcinogenesis and so SC number may be an important determinant of breast cancer risk later in life.",

Nine electronic databases, and trial registers, reference lists of retrieved articles and citations were searched. Intervention, cohort, case\u2013control or cross-sectional studies in adults were included if they examined the association between vitamin K levels (dietary intake, biomarkers, supplements) on clinical outcomes relevant to cardio-metabolic disease.Five studies met the inclusion criteria (1 trial, 4 cohort studies). Heterogeneity of designs, exposures/interventions and outcomes meant that meta-analysis was not possible. No associations were found between vitamin K1 intake and coronary heart disease (CHD) (4 cohorts) or stroke (2 cohorts) in multivariate analyses. No differences were seen in the prevalence of diabetes in a trial of vitamin K1 supplementation. Two cohorts examined the effects of vitamin K2 intake on the incidence of CHD; both found significant associations where higher vitamin K2 intake was associated with fewer CHD events.Few studies have examined the effects of vitamin K intake on clinical outcomes relevant to cardio-metabolic disorders. None of the studies used biomarkers. Currently there is no evidence for an effect of vitamin K1, but results for vitamin K2 look promising.

Currently available SERMs are used to treat and prevent breast cancer and osteoporosis, to treat ovulatory dysfunction in women, and for contraception. Because current therapies do not adequately treat menopausal symptoms, the search continues for the optimal SERM for postmenopausal women, which would relieve hot flushes, treat vaginal atrophy, and prevent fractures, while protecting the endometrium, breast, and cardiovascular system. Future use of SERMs may also include their use in a tissue selective estrogen complex (TSEC), a therapy that combines a SERM with estrogen(s), designed to deliver the efficacy of each component with improved overall tolerability for the treatment of postmenopausal women. The future of SERMs may also include their use in men for the treatment of osteoporosis and various syndromes associated with secondary hypogonadism and possibly prostate cancer. Continued research should allow the full potential of SERMs to be uncovered.",

Of 150 articles that were reviewed, eight articles were included with three themes in the outcomes for carers: service use, health promotion behaviors and psychological health (such as carer stress, burden or depressive symptoms). Overall, there were few consistent or statistically significant differences between urban and rural carers. Many of the differences observed were explained by other factors, such as carer or care recipient characteristics. The literature search was limited to papers in the English language, involving quantitative methods and published in peer-reviewed journals. There were not enough studies found to examine other outcomes or to pool data across studies. There is too little evidence comparing urban and rural carers to inform clinicians and policy makers.

Five hundred and sixty four (69%) were completed and returned by early 2006. Data analysis comprised descriptive and bivariate statistics and structural equation modeling.The results showed that midlife is a significant time for women to make positive health behavior changes. Approximately one-third of the sample (34.6%) indicated that they had increased their exercise and around 60% had made an effort to eat more healthily since age 40.

Body composition was evaluated by octopolar bioimpedance.Non-obese and non-sarcopenic started with heel contact followed by a latero-medial contact of the metatarsals and finally the hallux (the sarcopenic obese group ended in the toes 2\u20135). After heel off, the forefoot started to push off at the lateral metatarsals, followed by a more central push off and finally over the hallux (the sarcopenic obese group presented a greater oscillation in the metatarsals). The stance phase was divided into four distinct phases: initial contact (22.30%), forefoot contact (19.98%), foot flat (13.40%) and forefoot push off (44.32%). Sarcopenic obese spent more time in the forefoot contact phase (relative and absolute) and less time in the initial contact phase (%).These findings provide a reliable and representative reference dataset for temporal characteristics of foot roll-over during walking of postmenopausal women. Sarcopenic obesity affects significantly the temporal characteristics of foot roll-over during walking in this population. Such findings are of concern to clinicians interested in the promotion of activity to reduce obesity and gain or maintain muscle, since sarcopenic obesity affects normal walking, which might increase injuries.",

     "abstract": "Reproductive aging and ovarian senescence have considerable public health relevance because they are associated with increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), osteoporosis and other degenerative conditions including cognitive decline and potentially the metabolic syndrome. It has been suggested that the hormonal dysregulation that occurs during the perimenopausal transition may play a role in the initiation of pathobiological changes (e.g., adverse lipid profiles, atherosclerotic plaques) that will increase risk for chronic disease (e.g., CHD) during the postmenopausal years. Moreover, these early changes are suspected to establish a trajectory of disease progression that may be difficult to alter if interventions are not begun until after menopause. Even a slight increase in the rate of disease progression during the pre- or perimenopausal years could have substantial consequences for health and quality of life over the postmenopausal lifespan. Thus, the years leading up to menopause may offer a \u201ccritical window\u201d for interventions aimed at reducing the postmenopausal disease burden. The relationship between perimenopausal hormonal dysregulation and the risk for chronic disease is poorly understood due, in large part, to the lack of appropriate animal models of the perimenopausal transition and natural menopause. In this review we assesses studies of nonhuman primates (NHPs) evaluated in various reproductive stages (naturally pre-, peri- and postmenopausal, surgically menopausal) and their contribution to our understanding about risk factors for chronic disease. Finally, because large numbers of naturally perimenopausal and menopausal NHPs are not available for research at present, experimental approaches that have the potential to hasten the onset of the perimenopausal transition will be described.",

     "abstract": "Arthralgia is experienced by more then half of the women around the time of menopause. The causes of joint pain in postmenopausal women can be difficult to determine as the period of menopause coincides with rising incidence of chronic rheumatic conditions such as osteoarthritis. Nevertheless, prevalence of arthralgia does appear to increase in women with menopausal transition and is thought to result from reduction in oestrogen levels. Similar syndrome occurs following sudden withdrawal of hormone replacement therapy or treatment with aromatase inhibitors. Various interactions between sex hormones and pain processing pathways, immune cells and chondrocytes have been demonstrated but undoubtedly require further research. Whilst, at present, no specific treatment exists for menopausal arthralgia, a number of conservative measures may be effective. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been shown to have some benefit in alleviating arthralgia associated with menopausal transition, and can be considered in women who report distressing vasomotor symptoms. Simple analgesia, weight loss and physical exercise should be encouraged particularly in women with underlying osteoarthritis. Finally, other factors commonly associated with chronic pain and menopausal transition such as fatigue, poor sleep, sexual dysfunction and depression need to be addressed.",

Improved nutrition and enhanced access to medical care have increased the average lifespan for women in developed countries, and many will spend more than one-third of their life in a post-menopausal state. Epidemiological studies indicate that a delayed natural menopause confers longevity and decelerates the appearance of much age-related morbidity, suggesting that developing treatments to delay menopause would significantly improve quality of life for women. Although menopause is ultimately defined by ovarian follicular exhaustion, several lines of scientific evidence in humans and animals now suggest that dysregulation of estradiol feedback mechanisms and hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction contributes to the onset and progression of reproductive senescence, independent of ovarian failure. This article provides a brief update on our current understanding of the role of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis in the onset of and transition into female reproductive senescence.",

     "abstract": "Androgen deficiency in women has been recognized as a distinct clinical syndrome that affects thousands of women particularly women in the postmenopausal period of their life. This syndrome has been described by several names including female androgen deficiency syndrome as well as hypoactive, sexual desire disorder. A recent large survey concerning sexual problems in women also adds personal distress as a potential contributor to the low sexual desire found in some women with sexual dysfunction. Recognition of an androgen deficiency syndrome however, has been controversial and limited to a clinical diagnosis due to the lack of accurate and sensitive methods for measuring androgens in women. Up until now, available methods for measuring the sex steroids have been dependent on antibody based assays that employ a range of different detection systems including the use of isotopes such as tritium and I-125 or chemical signalling molecules that produce chemiluminescence. These assays have become increasingly more sensitive for the measurement of testosterone but are still incapable of providing the proper low-end sensitivity for analyzing testosterone in female blood specimens. Assays for testosterone performed either manually or with highly automated immunoassay instruments have been used to measure testosterone in women but with varying degrees of success. Existing immunoassay-based methods are quite adequate for measuring testosterone levels in males but lack sufficient sensitivity to accurately and reproducibly measure testosterone in females and pre-pubertal children. Recent advances with the use of ultrasensitive methods such as mass spectrometry coupled to either gas or liquid chromatography have improved the technology for measuring testosterone and other low concentration sex steroids like estradiol to the degree that mass spectrometry based methods are now capable of measuring the testosterone levels found in normal women and in women with extremely low levels of testosterone as observed in a true androgen deficiency disorder. This application of mass spectrometry for measuring testosterone should allow clinicians to better define female androgen deficiency and facilitate further investigation in the diagnosis and optimal management of androgen deficiency in women.",

Menopausal status-specific breast cancer incidence and detection rates were similar across definitions. Rates were unchanged when information regarding natural menopause, bilateral oophorectomy, hormone therapy, and timing of last menstrual period were sequentially added to definitions of postmenopausal status.Distinctions in menopausal status definitions contribute to notable differences in how women are classified, but translate to only slight differences in menopausal status-specific breast cancer rates.",

The observed relationships between visfatin and metabolisyndrome are inconsistent. The purpose of this study was to illuminate the relationship between visfatin and metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women.The present study included a sample of 110 postmenopausal Korean women. Subjects with cardiovascular disease or uncontrolled diabetes were excluded from the study sample. Body weight, height, blood pressure (BP), and waist and hip circumference were measured, and biochemical tests were performed.The mean serum visfatin level (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) of subjects with metabolic syndrome was 2.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.70\u00a0ng/ml. This was significantly higher than the mean level of subjects without metabolic syndrome (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). As the number of components of metabolic syndrome increased, the concentration of serum visfatin also increased (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Visfatin concentration was positively correlated with age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.209, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), waist circumference (r\u00a0=\u00a00.261, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), systolic BP (r\u00a0=\u00a00.255, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), diastolic BP (r\u00a0=\u00a00.252, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), fasting glucose level (r\u00a0=\u00a00.278, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), fasting insulin level (r\u00a0=\u00a00.313, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), HOMA-IR (r\u00a0=\u00a00.345, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), total cholesterol level (r\u00a0=\u00a00.213, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), triglyceride level (r\u00a0=\u00a00.368, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), WBC count (r\u00a0=\u00a00.352, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and homocysteine level (r\u00a0=\u00a00.196, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Using a multiple logistic regression analysis, visfatin was found to be an independent factor associated with metabolic syndrome after an adjustment for confounding variables including age, body mass index (BMI), and HOMA-IR.Serum visfatin was associated with metabolic syndrome in postmenopausal women.

Eighteen with normal glucose metabolism (NGT) and twenty with IGT, as it is diagnosed by OGTT. Serum leptin, adiponectin, hsCRP and MDA were measured at time 0 and 120\u00a0min of OGTT while total-cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, oxLDL and anti-oxLDL autoantibodies at time 0. Insulin resistance (HOMA)/sensitivity (QUICKI) indexes were estimated.In subjects with NGT, hsCRP was positively correlated with fasting leptin and HOMA, while in subjects with IGT negatively with QUICKI. In both groups, hsCRP was positively correlated with fasting insulin, body mass index and waist circumference. Fasting adiponectin was positively associated with HDL in both groups and negatively with triglycerides in subjects with NGT as well as with serum glucose levels at time 120\u00a0min of OGTT in subjects with IGT. No association was observed between oxLDL and adipokines. A significant positive association was found between oxLDL and HOMA in subjects with IGT. During OGTT there was a significant increase of leptin and MDA levels in both groups.A relationship exists between obesity, insulin and sub-clinical inflammation. Leptin and lipid peroxidation are linked to hyperglycaemic state while oxLDL might be considered as a predictor of insulin resistance.

     "abstract": "The aim of the present observational, cross-sectional study was to examine the effects of hormonal and psycho-relational variables on sexual function during menopausal transition and at early postmenopause in women with hot flushes.The sample comprised 138 women referred to a clinic for the treatment of hot flushes. They were categorised according to their stage of menopausal transition using the STRAW criteria: early menopausal transition (EMT) if their menstrual cycle was 7 or more days different from normal; late perimenopause (LMT) if they had experienced 60 days or more of amenorrhoea; and early postmenopause (EPM) if their amenorrhoea had lasted for at least 12 months but less than 4 years.Sexual function was measured by using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), while anxiety (state and trait), depression, eating disorder and marital adjustment were evaluated by validated self-report questionnaires. Levels of free testosterone (FT), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and estradiol (E2) were also measured.Overall sexual function varied significantly with stage of menopause, with total FSFI score less in EPM than in EMT (p\u00a0=\u00a0.009). A similar pattern was evident on FSFI sub-scales for sexual desire (p\u00a0=\u00a0.02), arousal (p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) orgasm (p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) and also pain (p\u00a0=\u00a0.02), but not for lubrication and satisfaction. Ratings for anxiety, depression and eating disorder did not differ across the menopausal sub-groups, and neither did ratings of marital adjustment. Both FT (p\u00a0=\u00a0.01) and DHEAS (p\u00a0=\u00a0.03) levels were slightly reduced at EPM in comparison with EMT, as were E2 levels (p\u00a0=\u00a0.001 EMT versus LMT; p\u00a0=\u00a0.0001 LMT versus EPM). In multiple regression analyses, plasma FT level was the only factor to predict FSFI full score (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0.48; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) in women at EMT, while in women at LMT the depression score was the only factor to do so (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212.62; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). The best model predicting FSFI full score at EPM included levels of DHEAS and E2 levels and state anxiety score.Hormonal and some psychological variables are relevant to sexual function in symptomatic women during menopausal transition and at early menopause but their role differs with the specific stage of reproductive ageing.",

     "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in postmenopausal women and estrogen deficiency may be an important factor in its development. The selective estrogen receptor modulator, raloxifene, exerts a part of its actions through the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) activation. We explored if polymorphisms of the ESR1 modify the effects of 6 months raloxifene treatment on endothelial function.A total of 53 postmenopausal women, mean age 59.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.2, finished the prospective clinical trial. The PvuII, XbaI, and P325P polymorphisms of the ESR1 gene were analyzed. In all subjects endothelium-dependent flow mediated dilatation (FMD) and cell adhesion molecules (CAM) ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin were measured before and after 6 months of raloxifene treatment.There was no difference in FMD between the ESR1 genotypes, at baseline. After raloxifene treatment, the FMD was significantly greater in subjects with XX genotype of XbaI polymorphism compared to xx (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and borderline greater when compared to Xx genotype (p\u00a0=\u00a00.053). The FMD increased significantly with raloxifene treatment in women with Xx genotype of XbaI and Pp genotype of PvuII polymorphisms (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.034, respectively). The P325P polymorphism did not influence the FMD after raloxifene. None of the ESR1 gene polymorphisms had any impact on the levels of CAM before or after the treatment. When analysing the whole group, a significant decrease in E-selectin (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and a small increase in ICAM-1 levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.029) was observed with raloxifene treatment, but no influence on VCAM-1 levels or FMD overall was seen.Our data suggest that XbaI and possibly PvuII polymorphisms of the ESR1 gene influence the impact of raloxifene treatment on endothelial function.

It can be \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201ciatrogenic\u201d such as after bilateral oophorectomy. It may be either primary or secondary. In the majority of cases of primary POF the cause is unknown. Chromosome abnormalities (especially X chromosome), follicle-stimulating hormone receptor gene polymorphisms, inhibin B mutations, enzyme deficiencies and autoimmune disease may be involved. Secondary POF is becoming more important as survival after treatment of malignancy through surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy continues to improve.To formulate a position statement on the management of premature ovarian failure.Literature review and consensus of expert opinion.Diagnosis should be confirmed with an elevated FSH greater than 40\u00a0IU/L and an estradiol level below 50\u00a0pmol/L in the absence of bilateral oophorectomy. Further assessment should include thyroid function tests, autoimmune screen for polyendocrinopathy, karyotype (less than 30 years of age) and bone mineral density. Untreated early ovarian failure increases the risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, dementia, cognitive decline and Parkinsonism. The mainstay of treatment is hormone therapy which needs to be continued until the average age of the natural menopause. With regard to fertility, while spontaneous ovulation may occur the best chance of achieving pregnancy is through donor oocyte in vitro fertilization. It is essential that women are provided with adequate information as they may find it a difficult diagnosis to accept. It is recommended that women with POF are seen in a specialist unit able to deal with their multiple needs.",

Similarly, regular fiber intake is effective in reducing serum total cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women.

Black cohosh appears to be effective therapy for relieving menopausal symptoms, primarily hot flashes, in early menopause. Phytoestrogen extracts, including isoflavones and lignans, appear to have only minimal effect on hot flashes but have other positive health effects, e.g. on plasma lipid levels and bone loss. For other commonly used CAMs, e.g. probiotics, prebiotics, acupuncture, homeopathy and DHEA-S, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are scarce and the evidence is unconvincing.

With sarcopaenia, there is change not only to muscle mass but also to muscle quality and function. As with other diseases, prevention is better than cure. With increasing age, there should be adequate protein intake and there is recommendation that the total protein intake is spread equally across three main meals. Sustained participation in resistance exercise programs also benefit muscle anabolism, an effect that may be enhanced if exercise is followed soon after by a high-protein meal. Attention to Vitamin D is not only likely to benefit muscle strength but would also reduce fracture risk with falls. Older people should focus on weight maintenance given that weight loss may result in undesirable loss of muscle mass. Those who are morbidly obese who need to lose weight should be advised to maintain protein intake and exercise to preserve muscle mass.

The objective of this paper is to review research on breast cancer and sexuality from the years 1998 to 2010. Research has documented a range of physical changes to a woman's sexuality following breast cancer, including disturbances to sexual functioning, as well as disruptions to sexual arousal, lubrication, orgasm, sexual desire, and sexual pleasure, resulting from chemotherapy, chemically induced menopause, tamoxifen, and breast cancer surgery. Women's intrapsychic experience of changes to sexuality includes a fear of loss of fertility, negative body image, feelings of sexual unattractiveness, loss of femininity, depression and anxiety, as well as alterations to a sense of sexual self. The discursive construction of femininity and sexuality shapes the way women construct and experience their illness and their body \u2013 leading many women to try to appear \u2018normal\u2019 to others post-breast surgery. Finally, the quality of a woman's partnered relationship consistently predicts sexual health post-breast cancer \u2013 reinforcing the importance of recognising the intersubjective nature of issues surrounding breast cancer and sexuality. It is concluded that analyses of sexuality in the context of breast cancer cannot conceptualise the physical body separately from women's intrapsychic negotiation, her social and relational context, and the discursive constructions of sexuality and femininity: a material\u2013discursive\u2013intrapsychic interaction.",

     "abstract": "Almost without exception clinical research seeking to evaluate the effectiveness of Chinese medicine relies on TCM textbook knowledge \u2013 accessed directly or via practitioners\u2019 clinical usage \u2013 in order to frame its hypotheses. Recent historical research shows that these textbooks, products of a politically directed process of modernisation, constitute complex hybrids of western and Chinese knowledge that are designed to facilitate the integration of Chinese medicine into biomedically dominated contexts of practice. As such they produce a number of unresolved and generally unacknowledged tensions, such as between the emphasis on local illness experience in the Chinese medical tradition and the universality aspired to by biomedical knowledge. To examine the effect of these tensions we have carried out a study that compares local symptom patterns experienced by post-menopausal women in London with the universal patterns described in TCM textbooks. The results of this study confirm our proposition, namely that the TCM textbook descriptions of disease are not always grounded in clinical experience even if that is what textbooks claim. This raises questions about the relation of textbooks to clinical practice, and about the validity of clinical research based on textbooks and textbook derived normative practice. We argue that only a multidisciplinary approach that includes an understanding of the historical construction of contemporary Chinese medical knowledge and its relation to clinical practice can overcome these problems and enable a meaningful evaluation and utilisation of Chinese medicine in the context of 21st century evidence-based healthcare.",

     "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is a chronic disorder of mood which leads to episodes of either elevated mood or depression in a sizable number of adults in the community (1%). Though the prevalence rates in the elderly are lower in the community (up to 0.1%), there is significantly higher morbidity in protected environments like care homes and hospital settings where prevalence rates may be as high as 10%. Bipolar disorder in the elderly is probably heterogenous and its etiopathogenesis is complex. Bipolar disorder may be divided into two distinct subtypes, the late onset bipolar (LOB) and the early onset bipolar (EOB) groups. LOB patients tend to have a milder illness in terms of manic severity but they have higher medical and neurological burden. They also have lower familial burden of bipolar illness as compared to EOB patients. There is an increased risk of dementia and stroke in patients with late life bipolar disorder (and there may be a protective effect of lithium in preventing dementia). White matter changes, as seen by increased white matter hyperintensities on neuroimaging, are also increased, providing further evidence of cerebrovascular disease. Treatment of late life bipolar is currently based on guidelines drawn up for younger bipolar disorder patients. Good quality intervention studies are needed to estimate the possible protective effect of cognitive enhancers and/or vascular prevention strategies. This review suggests that late life bipolar disorder, particularly late onset bipolar disorder, is probably a distinct diagnostic entity compared to the younger bipolar patients as it has a different presentation, etiology and hence perhaps needs different treatment strategies.",

     "abstract": "Human exposure to environmental endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) have received increased attention in recent years due to the documentation of widespread exposure to a number of EDCs among the general population, experimental data demonstrating endocrine-related effects on reproduction, development, metabolism, and cancer, and observations for increasing trends (as well as geographic trends) in endocrine-related disorders among populations. However, human studies of exposure to most environmental EDCs in relation to adverse health outcomes remain limited. This review focuses on the human data generated to date on the relationship between exposures to environmental EDCs and men's health. The agents discussed here, which include polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), pesticides, phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were chosen based on their exposure prevalence and the presence of existing human data in studies of male reproductive health, altered reproductive and thyroid hormone levels, diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome, and endocrine-related cancers. Taken together, the epidemiologic data on the environmental EDCs suggest that there may be associations between exposure and adverse health outcomes in men. However, the limited human data, and in many instances inconsistent data across studies, highlight the need for further research on these chemicals. Future longitudinal molecular epidemiology studies with appropriately designed exposure assessments are needed to determine potential causal relationships, to identify the most important time windows/life stages of exposure, and to define individual susceptibility factors for adverse effects on men's health in response to exposure.",

     "abstract": "Overactive bladder is a condition whose prevalence increases with ageing, and which can substantially impair quality of life. It is defined by presence of urinary urgency, in the absence of other causes of similar problems. The underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood, but may include increased excitability of smooth muscle, abnormal spread of excitation through the bladder wall, increased sensory nerve activity, and altered processing of information in the central nervous system. Clinical assessment requires evaluation of symptoms and their impact, and exclusion of confounding co-morbidities. Initial treatment comprises fluid advice and bladder training, followed by drug prescription. Antimuscarinic drugs can improve symptom severity and quality of life, but adverse effects include dry mouth, constipation and cognitive impairment; a minority of patients persist with these drugs in the longer term. Optimising medical management requires tailoring drugs according to efficacy and adverse effects, and also checking compliance. Refractory bothersome symptoms merit secondary care input, usually with urodynamic evaluation to define underlying mechanisms. Neuromodulatory techniques (sacral or tibial nerve stimulation) and reconstructive surgery (augmentation cystoplasty, detrusor myectomy or urinary diversion) can be offered in severe cases, but can have inadequate outcomes and significant implications. Newer approaches under investigation include pharmaceutical interventions to reduce cellular excitability or generation of sensory nerve activity; potential targets include beta-3 adrenergic receptors, Transient Receptor Potential (TRP) channels and surface ion channels. Intravesical botulinum injections are an unlicensed approach which may achieve reduced contractility and sensory nerve activity, but voiding dysfunction is common and long-term effects uncertain.",

However, older women have been under-represented in these trials, as only six of them registered patients over 60 years of age. The proportion of women aged over 70 years was low and there are no data for patients older than 74. Several meta-analyses have been conducted and a plausible estimate of the impact of screening is a 16% reduction in breast cancer mortality (95% confidence interval 9\u201323%). Some meta-analyses provide \u201cpost hoc subgroup analyses\u201d by age and these have found a greater benefit of screening for women of older age, with estimates of risk reductions of 17%, 27% and 22% for cohorts of women aged 55\u201364, 60\u201369 and 65\u201374; these figures are significantly different from 0.

Nevertheless, there has been no formal demonstration of an interaction with age. When these estimates are translated into the number of women who need to be screened in order to avoid one death from breast cancer during 15 years of follow-up, the figure lies between 1370 and 4120.

These benefits should be balanced against the possible disadvantages of screening, including false positive results, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. One of the meta-analyses concluded that the rate of total mastectomies was significantly increased after screening. Although most scientific recommendations agree that screening should be proposed to all women aged 50\u201369 years, the benefits and disadvantages of mammography should be fully explained, in order to allow them to make a truly informed decision.",

     "abstract": "Stroke is a very common cause of adult disability often leaving stroke survivors dependent on others. Much of this support comes from informal carers. Research has demonstrated the importance of these carers to survivors\u2019 recovery but also suggests that caregiving has adverse consequences. Meta-ethnography was applied to review qualitative research looking at informal stroke carers\u2019 experiences and responses to caring. Electronic databases from 2006 to 2009 were searched and after application of inclusion and exclusion criteria, seven studies were reviewed.The experience of caring for stroke survivors centres around change and loss overlaid with uncertainty. Change includes changes in roles and relationships. Losses include former relationships, autonomy and taken-for-granted futures. These challenge carers\u2019 perception of their identity.Carers respond cognitively and practically and attempts to reconstruct their lives may lead to acceptance and adjustment. This process is one of biographical disruption for carers but can result in personal growth.If carers and stroke survivors are to be supported, acknowledging specific issues including role and relationship changes and perceptions of reduced autonomy may be more valuable than attempting to reduce carer burden or strain. Clinicians frequently only see families over short periods and may therefore have little understanding of the major, long-term disruptive impact of caregiving. If professionals working with families of stroke survivors are made aware of this and of the necessity for carers to come to terms with their changed roles and identities, they will be better equipped to understand and respond to carers\u2019 practical and emotional needs.",

     "abstract": "From 2002 to 2003, the breast cancer incidence in the United States, as reported by the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER 9) database, appeared to decrease by 6.7%. This phenomenon has been attributed to a reduction in the use of menopausal hormone therapies after the initial publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study results in July of 2002. However, attempts to draw a causal association between the use of menopausal hormone therapies and the incidence of breast cancer have not accounted for the facts that prescriptions of estrogen-plus-progestin menopausal therapies, which are associated with increased rates of breast cancer, fell by 53% from 2002 to 2003, while prescriptions of estrogen-only therapies fell by only 27%. To address this issue, we analyzed the effects of the higher rate of discontinuation of estrogen-plus-progestin menopausal therapies relative to estrogen-only treatments during the 2002\u20132003 time period, based upon the effects of different types of menopausal hormone therapies on breast cancer incidence as determined by the WHI interventional hormone trials. This approach demonstrates that the relative persistence with menopausal estrogen-only therapies \u2013 as compared to estrogen-plus-progestin therapies \u2013 can explain the reduction in breast cancer incidence from 2002 to 2003. In addition, we point out the incompatibility of the breast cancer incidence rates found in the two WHI interventional hormone trials and the rates reported in the SEER 9 database. Based on these findings, we conclude \u2013 as previously demonstrated in the estrogen-only arm of the WHI interventional hormone trials \u2013 that menopausal estrogen-only use is not responsible for increasing the risk of breast cancer in menopausal women and may, in fact, be protective. Additional studies are still needed to better define the relationship between different types of menopausal hormone therapies and the incidence of breast cancer.",

All the baseline evaluation was performed before starting AI treatment.Mean age at baseline (\u00b1SD) was 63.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8 years. In 150 (64.9%) cases, the women had been treated previously with tamoxifen; 101 (43.7%) started exemestane, 119 (51.5%) letrozole, and 11 (4.8%) anastrozole. The AI were initiated within 6 weeks after surgery or after the last cycle of chemotherapy.At baseline, 88.1% had 25(OH)D levels <30\u00a0ng/ml, 21.2% had severe deficiency (<10\u00a0ng/ml), and 25% of the participants had osteoporosis. Mean daily calcium intake was low (841\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0338).We found a significant association between 25(OH)D levels and BMD at baseline, which remained significant in femoral neck BMD after multivariate adjustment.Plasma 25(OH)D levels improved significantly at 3 months follow-up in those treated with high dose Vitamin D supplements: mean increase 32.55\u00a0ng/ml (95%CI 28.06\u201337.03).Our study suggests a high prevalence of commonly unrecognized Vitamin D deficiency in women with EBC treated with AI, a known osteopenic agent. Our results support the need for a routine assessment of 25(OH)D levels and, when necessary, supplementation in these patients.",

Beliefs regarding these complaints may vary from one population to another.To assess HF beliefs and factors related to negative beliefs in a climacteric Hispanic population using the Hot Flush Beliefs Scale (HFBS).A total of 1154 healthy women (40\u201359 years) were assessed with the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS), those presenting HFs were requested to fill out the HFBS and a questionnaire containing socio-demographic data (female and partner).A total of 646 presented HFs (56%) graded according to the first item of the MRS as mild (28.6%), moderate (33.2%), severe (29.1%) and very severe (9.1%). Mean age of these women was 49.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.2 years, with 51.9% having 12 or less years of education, 61.5% being postmenopausal and 47.2% living in high altitude. At the moment of the survey 13.9% were on HT, 12.8% on phytoestrogens and 7.1% on psychotropic drugs. Women strongly disagreed in more negatively oriented items of those contained in subscale one (beliefs about self in social context). Contrary to this, women strongly agreed in more negative oriented items contained in subscale two which assesses beliefs about coping with HFs. Women presenting with severe\u2013very severe HFs displayed higher HFBS total and subscale scores indicating a more negative belief regarding HFs. Logistic regression analysis determined that HF severity was related to higher HFBS scores for the total and subscales one and two. Current smoking, higher parity, lower female education, female psychiatric consultation, time since menopause and partner unhealthiness and alcohol consumption were also related to higher HFBS scorings. Postmenopausal status and church attendance were related to lower scores.In this mid-aged Ecuadorian female series negative beliefs regarding HFs were related to the severity of HFs and individual female or partner characteristics. Data provided from clinical research using this tool, alone or in combination with other tests, is warranted.",

To establish possible mechanisms of action of JP for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, the estrogenic and progesterone agonists, and antiinflammatory activities were investigated.The methanol extract (JP-M) was tested in ER and PR binding assays, a COX-2 enzyme inhibition assay, the ER\u03b2-CALUX assay in U2-OS cells, as well as reporter and endogenous gene assays in MCF-7 K1 cells.The JP-M extract inhibited COX-2 catalytic activity (IC50 4.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL); bound to both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 (IC50 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL and 23.1\u00a0\u03bcg/mL, respectively); induced estrogen-dependent transcription in the ER\u03b2-CALUX; and bound to the progesterone receptor (IC50 22.8\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). The extract also modulated the expression of endogenous estrogen responsive genes pS2, PR, and PTGES in MCF-7 cells at a concentration of 20\u00a0\u03bcg/mL. Activation of a 2 ERE-construct in transiently transfected MCF-7 cells by the extract was inhibited by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182,780, indicating that the effects were mediated through the estrogen receptor. Finally, the extract weakly enhanced the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, however this was not statistically significant as compared with DMSO controls.Extracts of J. pectoralis have estrogenic, progestagenic and anti-inflammatory effects, and thus have a plausible mechanism of action, explaining its traditional use for menopause and PMS.",

Postmenopausal status is associated with higher prevalence of obesity, as 44% of postmenopausal women are overweight, among whom 23% are obese. Obesity often co-exists with other diseases, the most important being diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and hypertension. Furthermore, obesity increases the risk of gynecologic cancer, cardiovascular disease, venous thromboembolism, osteoarthritis and chronic back pain.To formulate a position statement on the management of the menopause in obese women.Literature review and consensus of expert opinion.Obese women seeking hormone therapy should be evaluated for their individual baseline risk of developing breast cancer, cardiovascular disease and venous thromboembolism. These risks should be weighed against expected benefit from symptom relief, improved quality of life and osteoporosis prevention. The lowest effective estrogen dose should be used (CEE 0.300\u20130.400\u00a0mg or estradiol 0.5\u20131\u00a0mg orally daily or 25\u201350\u00a0\u03bcg estradiol transdermally). With regard to progestogens, although no RCT data exist, there are observational studies showing that micronized progesterone or dydrogesterone may have a better risk profile with respect to breast cancer risk. There are no RCT data comparing various progestogens with regard to VTE risk. There are observational data, however, suggesting that micronized progesterone or pregnane derivatives may be associated with a lower VTE risk in postmenopausal women taking HT compared to nonpregnane derivatives. There is a rationale in suggesting the use of transdermal HT in obese women, since this route of administration has been associated with a lesser risk of venous thromboembolism than oral therapy.",

     "abstract": "This article provides an overview and critical evaluation of the management of menopausal symptoms by traditional East Asian medicines (TEAMs). For this purpose we utilise an interdisciplinary perspective that draws on social history, medical anthropology, and clinical research. Our goal is threefold. First, we examine the research literature regarding evidence for the effectiveness of TEAMs in the management of menopausal symptoms. The failure of all studies reviewed to address the problematic articulation between tradition and modernity in the case of menopausal syndrome leads us to examine more closely how this connection has been constructed. In the second part of this review we explain how during the late 20th century various TEAMs currents such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Japanese Kamp\u014d, and Korean medicine, explored different responses to a biomedically defined disorder, namely menopause, that was until then not discussed in these traditions. Third, based on the findings of the previous sections we make a number of recommendations as to how research in this field might be improved. We argue that while robust evidence for the efficacy of TEAMs in treating menopausal symptoms is currently lacking, existing studies provide sufficient evidence to warrant further research. A new interdisciplinary research framework that takes account of the actual realities of TEAMs practice will be required however for meaningful answers regarding the two most urgent problems in the field to emerge. These are, first the issue of actual treatment effects, and second the more general problem of how TEAMs might be integrated into personalised health care.",

     "abstract": "Acupuncture is one of the complementary therapies that are increasingly used by women with menopausal hot flushes. Acupuncture can be understood as a form of neurological stimulation. Clinical trials of acupuncture use different control groups according to whether they wish to provide practical information on the role of acupuncture in health care, or theoretical information on the specific needle effect. Controls for the latter research question are highly problematic, and no convincingly inert \u2018placebo\u2019 needle has yet been designed. For natural menopause, one large study has shown acupuncture to be superior to self-care alone in reducing the number of hot flushes and improving the quality of life; five small studies have been unable to demonstrate that the effect of acupuncture is limited to any particular points, as traditional theory would suggest; and one study showed acupuncture was superior to blunt needle for flash frequency but not intensity. For flushes associated with induced menopause, clearly acupuncture is useful for reducing flushes in clinical practice, but there is mixed evidence on the nature of the effect: one trial found genuine acupuncture superior to control needling, but another showed no significant difference between acupuncture and blunt needle. The possible mechanisms of acupuncture for hot flushes are discussed. Current evidence clearly justifies further research into the most cost effective form of acupuncture for treating hot flushes.",

Interventions included yoga and/or meditation-based programs, tai chi, and other relaxation practices, including muscle relaxation and breath-based techniques, relaxation response training, and low-frequency sound-wave therapy. Eight of the nine studies of yoga, tai chi, and meditation-based programs reported improvement in overall menopausal and vasomotor symptoms; six of seven trials indicated improvement in mood and sleep with yoga-based programs, and four studies reported reduced musculoskeletal pain. Results from the remaining nine trials suggest that breath-based and other relaxation therapies also show promise for alleviating vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms, although intergroup findings were mixed. Most studies reviewed suffered methodological or other limitations, complicating interpretation of findings.Collectively, findings of these studies suggest that yoga-based and certain other mind-body therapies may be beneficial for alleviating specific menopausal symptoms. However, the limitations characterizing most studies hinder interpretation of findings and preclude firm conclusions regarding efficacy. Additional large, methodologically sound trials are needed to determine the effects of specific mind-body therapies on menopausal symptoms, examine long-term outcomes, and investigate underlying mechanisms.",

All statistically significant improvements were of muscle function.The published literature to date provides only weak support for the efficacy of WBV exposure for muscle function, muscle morphology, or bone architecture in older adults. Irregularities in study design and WBV protocols across the literature and poor quality trials contribute to this inconsistency, revealing the need for more uniformity in future trials. Future research should be more robust in design, include larger cohorts, longer interventions and standardisation of protocols.

The objective of this review is to examine the benefits of PS on CVD as well as ageing-associated diseases. PS have the ability to significantly lower LDL-C; yet, the large inter-individual variability in the lowering of LDL-C may be due to subject characteristics, food matrix of PS, dose of PS, dietary background, frequency of intake of PS, the additive effect of other foods or drugs, as well as genetic factors. Further, PS may also have other potential beneficial effects including anti-atherogenic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-cancer activities. Overall, dietary intervention strategies, such as incorporating PS into a healthy diet, should be recommended and implemented in older adult populations in order to prevent ageing-associated diseases and hence promote healthy ageing.",

     "abstract": "Plant derived products are consumed by a large percentage of the population to prevent, delay and ameliorate disease burden; however, relatively little is known about the efficacy, safety and underlying mechanisms of these traditional health products, especially when taken in concert with pharmaceutical agents. The flavonoids are a group of plant metabolites that are common in the diet and appear to provide some health benefits. While flavonoids are primarily derived from soy, many are found in fruits, nuts and more exotic sources, e.g., kudzu. Perhaps the strongest evidence for the benefits of flavonoids in diseases of aging relates to their effect on components of the metabolic syndrome. Flavonoids from soy, grape seed, kudzu and other sources all lower arterial pressure in hypertensive animal models and in a limited number of tests in humans. They also decrease the plasma concentration of lipids and buffer plasma glucose. The underlying mechanisms appear to include antioxidant actions, central nervous system effects, gut transport alterations, fatty acid sequestration and processing, PPAR activation and increases in insulin sensitivity. In animal models of disease, dietary flavonoids also demonstrate a protective effect against cognitive decline, cancer and metabolic disease. However, research also indicates that the flavonoids can be detrimental in some settings and, therefore, are not universally safe. Thus, as the population ages, it is important to determine the impact of these agents on prevention/attenuation of disease, including optimal exposure (intake, timing/duration) and potential contraindications.",

     "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease associated with an imbalance in bone remodeling resulting in a reduction in bone strength and increased fracture risk. The principal regulator of osteoclastic bone resorption is receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL), a cytokine member of the tumor necrosis factor family. The binding of RANKL to its receptor on the cell surface of osteoclasts and pre-osteoclasts increases the formation, activity, and survival of osteoclasts. Denosumab is an investigational fully human monoclonal antibody to RANKL. By binding to RANKL, denosumab prevents RANKL from binding to its receptor, resulting in a decrease in bone resorption due to reduction in the formation, activity, and survival of osteoclasts. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, denosumab 60\u00a0mg by subcutaneous injection every 6 months increased bone mineral density (BMD), reduced bone turnover markers, and reduced the risk of vertebral, hip, and non-vertebral fractures. In postmenopausal women with low BMD, denosumab increased BMD and reduced bone turnover markers. It was well tolerated with a safety profile generally similar to placebo. Denosumab is a promising emerging drug for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. It may be particularly useful in clinical practice for the treatment of patients with gastrointestinal contraindications or side effects with oral bisphosphonates and for patients with malabsorption.",

More than in comparable groups of caregivers or peers, they are confronted with feelings of depression and decreased physical health. Although many studies are set up to determine the link between the stressors in dementia care-giving and the impact on the family caregiver, the results remained inconclusive. Others, depression in caregivers remains the main cause of a premature or acute ending of home care.The aim of this systematic literature review was to analyse what factors determine the development of depression in caregivers of elderly patients with dementia. Depression was taken as primary outcome as it is shown to be the main reason for caregivers to abandon home care.Depression occurs in one in three of caregivers and it occurs more frequently in those who care for patients with dementia than in caregivers of patients with other chronic illnesses.Caregiver characteristics rather than objective care needs of the patients tend to be responsible for the onset of depression. Future research should concentrate on demonstrating links between negative feelings in caregivers and the way the care situation evolves. This can have important implications in home care support.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this open, multicentre study was to demonstrate the endometrial safety and assess the bleeding pattern of ultra low dose continuous combined hormone replacement therapy with 0.5\u00a0mg 17\u03b2-oestradiol and 2.5\u00a0mg dydrogesterone in 446 healthy, non-hysterectomised, postmenopausal women with symptoms of oestrogen deficiency.Aspiration endometrial biopsies were performed at baseline and after 1 year of treatment to assess the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia or a more serious endometrial outcome.The only adverse endometrial outcome at the end of the study was one case of simple hyperplasia. This gives an overall incidence of 0.27% (95% CI: 0.01\u20131.48%) in the per protocol sample (n\u00a0=\u00a0395). The overall rate of amenorrhoea in the full sample (n\u00a0=\u00a0446) was 68% and 14% had only one or two bleeding/spotting episodes. The rate of amenorrhoea in months 10\u201312 (n\u00a0=\u00a0413) was 88%. The number of bleeding/spotting days per cycle fell during the study. The mean number of bleeding/spotting days was 5.8 and the mean number of days without bleeding was 358.2. Spotting alone was the most prevalent bleeding intensity, whilst heavy bleeding was rare.In conclusion, 2.5\u00a0mg dydrogesterone continuously combined with 0.5\u00a0mg 17\u03b2-oestradiol effectively protects the endometrium in postmenopausal women in accordance with the guidelines of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). It has a favourable amenorrhoea rate and is well tolerated by the majority of women.",

The impact of a balance exercise program on improving the quality of life is not well established. We have, therefore, investigated the effect of 12-month Balance Training Program in quality of life, functional balance and falls in elderly OP women.Sixty consecutive women with senile OP were randomized into a Balance Training Group (BT) of 30 patients and no intervention control group (CG) of 30 patients. The BT program included techniques to improve balance over a period of 12 months (1\u00a0h exercise session/week and home-based exercises). The quality of life was evaluated before and at the end of the trial using the Osteoporosis Assessment Questionnaire (OPAQ), functional balance was evaluated by Berg Balance Scale (BBS).

Use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) might be associated with decreased left ventricular mass (LVM) and lower risk of LVH, although results of previous observational and clinical studies are inconclusive. Therefore, we analyzed the association between MHT use and either LVM indexed to height2.7 (LVMI) or LVH determined echocardiographically.Data from women aged \u2265\u00a045 years recruited for the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania were used for cross-sectional (n\u00a0=\u00a0975) and longitudinal (n\u00a0=\u00a0675; 361 women without LVH at baseline) analyses. Information on ever (past and current) and never use of MHT were obtained. Linear (LVMI) or logistic (LVH) regression analyses were performed while controlling for potential confounders.Crude and age-adjusted analyses suggested an association between ever use of MHT and lower odds for LVH. This association was no longer significant in fully adjusted models. Compared to women who never used MHT, the odds ratios of LVH for ever MHT users were 0.97 [95%-confidence interval (95%-CI) 0.71\u20131.30] in cross-sectional and 0.70 (95%-CI 0.44\u20131.11) in longitudinal fully adjusted analyses. Similarly, results with an alternative classification of MHT use (never, past, and current) indicated no significant associations with LVH after full adjustment.This study provides little evidence of an association between MHT use and LVH. Differences in lifestyle or health-related factors between never and MHT users could provide an explanation, in part, for the presumptive protective benefit of MHT on LVH.",

The objective of this report is to present a review of the published epidemiologic research on lifestyle and breast cancer outcomes among women with a history of breast cancer. This review focused on physical activity, diet, and adiposity; and the primary outcomes were additional breast cancer events and mortality. The most consistent finding from observational studies was that adiposity was associated with a 30% increased risk of mortality. Although the observational data were not as consistent (or abundant), physical activity appeared to be associated with a 30% decreased risk of mortality. These data do not indicate that alcoholic drinks are a risk factor. Based only on the observational studies, total dietary fat appeared to be a risk factor, fiber was protective, and information on micronutrients and specific foods was sparse. However, the null results of 2 dietary intervention trials in survivors suggests that lowering fat intake or increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and fiber will not lead to improved prognosis in breast cancer survivors. Given that a high proportion of breast cancer patients appear to be both sedentary and obese/overweight, clinical trials are needed to investigate whether the combination of increased physical activity and reduced adiposity can improve breast cancer prognosis.",

     "abstract": "It is well-established that total testosterone (TT) in men decreases with age and that bioavailable testosterone (bio-T) falls to an even greater extent. The clinical relevance of declining androgens in the aging male and use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in this situation is controversial. Most studies have been short term and there are no large randomized placebo-controlled trials. Testosterone has many physiological actions in: muscles, bones, hematopoietic system, brain, reproductive and sexual organs, adipose tissue. Within these areas it stimulates: muscle growth and maintenance, bone development while inhibiting bone resorption, the production of red blood cells to increase hemoglobin, libido, enhanced mood and cognition, erectile function and lipolysis. Anabolic deficits in aging men can induce: frailty, sarcopenia, poor muscle quality, muscle weakness, hypertrophy of adipose tissue and impaired neurotransmission. The aging male with reduced testosterone availability may present with a wide variety of symptoms which in addition to frailty and weakness include: fatigue, decreased energy, decreased motivation, cognitive impairment, decreased self-confidence, depression, irritability, osteoporotic pain and the lethargy of anemia. In addition, testosterone deficiency is also associated with type-2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, stroke and transient ischemic attacks, and cardiovascular disease in general. Furthermore, there are early studies to suggest that TRT in men with low testosterone levels may improve metabolic status by: lowering blood sugar and HbA1C in men with type-2 diabetes, reducing abdominal girth, ameliorating features of the metabolic syndrome, all of which may be protective of the cardiovascular system. The major safety issue is prostate cancer but there is no evidence that supports the idea that testosterone causes the development of a de novo cancer. So on balance in a man with symptoms of hygonadism and low or lowish levels of testosterone with no evidence of prostate cancer such as a normal PSA a therapeutic (4\u20136 months) trial of TRT is justified. Treatment and monitoring of this duration will determine whether the patient is responsive.",

     "abstract": "Matters of sexuality and intimacy greatly impact quality of life of patients with gynecologic cancers. Vast amount of evidence exists showing that cancer dramatically impacts woman's sexuality, sexual functioning, intimate relationships and sense of self. Sexual functioning can be affected by illness, pain, anxiety, anger, stressful circumstances and medications. There is a growing acknowledgement that these needs are not being appropriately addressed by providers.With improvements in early detection, surgery and adjuvant therapy for gynecologic cancer, long term survival and cure are becoming possible. Quality of life is thus becoming a major issue for patients. Patients suffer from hot flashes, difficulty sleeping, loss of libido and intimacy, all resulting in significant morbidity and loss of quality of life. Using hormone replacement therapy in gynecologic cancer survivors is a topic a great debate.While limited studies are available to date, retrospective cohort reviews show no reported differences in overall or disease-free survival in patients using hormone replacements vs. controls in patients with ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, cervical, vaginal or vulva cancer.Since safety of using HRT remains controversial and prospective studies are lacking, providers need to be able to provide alternatives to HRT. Centrally acting agents such as antiseizure agent gabapentin and selective serotonine re-uptake inhibitors, such as venlafaxine and fluoxitine have been demonstrated to show effectiveness in treating vasomotor symptoms and are easily tolerated. To address cardiovascular and osteoporosis risks of post-menopausal status, exercise, healthy diet, bisphosphonates, raloxifen and statins have been found to be effective.Psychotherapy plays an essential part in management of these issues. Review of the literature reveals recent trends among health psychologists to utilize psychoeducational interventions that include combined elements of cognitive and behavioral therapy with education and mindfulness training. Intervention studies have found positive effects from this approach, particularly within the areas of arousal, orgasm, satisfaction, overall well-being, and decreased depression.Many of patients\u2019 issues are easy to address with either hormonal, non-hormonal or psychotherapy modifications. The essential part of success is the providers appreciation of this serous problem and willingness and comfort in addressing it.",

     "publication date": "05-2010",
     "abstract": "Obesity has a complex relationship to breast cancer risk that differs in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. Before the menopause, the level of adiposity is inversely related to risk, indicative of a protective effect, whereas in postmenopausal women, particularly the elderly, the association is a positive one, consistent with obesity being a risk factor. The importance of high estrogen production in adipose tissue, with consequent elevation of circulating biologically available estradiol, in the promotional effect of obesity on postmenopausal breast carcinogenesis is well established; the resulting tumors express both estrogen and progesterone receptors. The mechanism(s) for the protective effect in premenopausal women is less well understood, but the breast cancers that do develop in the presence of obesity are most often estrogen and progesterone receptor negative, consistent with the selection of non-estrogen-dependent tumor cells which are dependent on growth factors such as insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I and some adipokines. The influence of menopausal status on the relationships between adiposity and breast cancer appears to be modified within each category by age; the protective effect before the menopause may be limited to younger women (<35 years), and the adverse effect was found to apply specifically to older postmenopausal women. Although randomized trials of weight reduction for postmenopausal breast cancer prevention have not been performed, observational studies suggested that risk reduction does occur; in addition, other health benefits of weight control need to be considered regardless of menopausal status.",

We reviewed papers that have reported reference values for people older than 65 years with or without overt health problems. Wider intervals have generally been reported for sodium, potassium, calcium and C-reactive protein (CRP) in the elderly. Higher levels of creatinine and lower levels of total cholesterol (TC) and serum albumin (SA) are observed with ageing. Elderly people have been found to be at greater risk for overt abnormalities in sodium, potassium, creatinine, TC, SA and CRP. The consequences of these abnormalities could be severe. For instance, even mild hyponatremia was associated with increased risk of mortality, disability and myocardial infarction. Mild hypernatremia was associated with severe disability. Mild increases in CRP levels were associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia, disability, cardiovascular disease and cognitive decline. Mild decreases in TC levels were associated with an increased risk of disability or mortality, and mild decreases in SA were associated with an increased risk of mortality, disability, sarcopenia and frailty. Nutritional factors could not wholly explain these effects. Modified biochemical reference values are required for elderly patients, as biochemical results can serve as markers of vulnerability to age-related diseases, linked to metabolism. Careful diagnosis and corrective interventions are needed for patients in this age group.",

This debate is based on many animal and cell culture data showing that estrogens can positively affect the aging brain. Observational data also show a halved risk of dementia in women who took estrogens around the age of menopause. However, large treatment trials have shown negative effects of long-term treatment with estrogens in older women. The present meta-analyses included 36 randomised treatment trials and tested various hypotheses which have been developed to attempt to explain discrepant data. Results indicated that, contrary to expectations, age of women and duration of time elapsed when treatment was initiated since menopause (\u2018window of opportunity\u2019 hypothesis) did not significantly affect treatment outcome, nor did it matter whether women were symptomatic or not. It was not clear whether bilateral oophorectomy affected the outcome, as this effect was based on only a few studies from the same group and some observational studies show negative effects on cognition in surgical menopausal women treated with hormones for more than 10 years. Duration of treatment overall significantly affected outcome. More negative effects were seen in longer studies, where positive effects were mainly seen in short term studies (<4 months). Treatment with combined estrogens and progestagens also negatively affected the outcome.

A better understanding of factors contributing to deleterious structural knee changes may be important for preventing OA. In men, occupations associated with frequent knee bending have been shown to be associated with damage to knee cartilage. This has not been examined in women. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of occupational specific knee activities on tibial and patella cartilage morphology among healthy females.96 females aged 26\u201362 years with no history of knee injury or symptoms were recruited as part of a study of community-based study of lifestyle factors on knee health. Occupational activity data examining the frequency of tasks such as heavy lifting, knee bending, stair climbing, walking and standing were obtained by questionnaire. Tibial and patella cartilage volumes and defects were measured from magnetic resonance imaging using validated methods.Heavy lifting/bending/squatting, knee bending, stair climbing and walking were all associated with an increased risk of patella, but not tibial, cartilage defects (odds ratio 1.8\u20132.9; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) after adjustment for potential confounders, including knee alignment and radiographic joint space narrowing. There was a trend towards knee bending being associated with a reduction in patella cartilage volume (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07).Our results demonstrate that asymptomatic adult females with occupations requiring frequent knee bending have patella, but not tibial cartilage damage. These findings suggest that vocational tasks requiring knee bending are detrimental to the structure of cartilage in females and may be an area to consider in the prevention of knee OA.",

The odds ratios (ORs) for a low FVC were calculated across all three groups.CRP levels are negatively associated with forced expiratory volume (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) and FVC after adjustment for confounding variables. The adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for a low FVC according to three groups were 1.00 (reference), 2.08 (1.03\u20134.20), and 2.55 (1.31\u20134.98) in postmenopausal women after adjusting for confounding variables.In summary, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are strongly and independently associated with impaired pulmonary function and more frequent a low FVC in postmenopausal women.",

Mothers were classified into five clusters based on their pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) values: non-obese (less than 30), class I obese (30.0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0BMI\u00a0\u2264\u00a034.9), class II obese (35.0\u00a0\u2264\u00a0BMI\u00a0\u2264\u00a039.9), class III obese (40\u00a0\u2264\u00a0BMI\u00a0\u2264\u00a049.9), and super-obese (BMI\u00a0\u2265\u00a050.0).MIPB occurred more frequently among older than younger women [11.8% vs. 6.4%, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001)) whereas SPB occurred more frequently among younger women [11.3% vs. 10.5%, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001)). Maternal obesity increased the risk for MIPB but not for SPB. Regardless of BMI status, the risk of MIPB was elevated among older mothers, particularly among those with suboptimal (<0.23\u00a0kg/week) and supraoptimal (>0.68\u00a0kg/week) gestational weight gain. A dose\u2013response relationship with increasing gestational weight gain was evident (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01); the greatest risk for MIPB occurred among older mothers with weekly gestational weight gain in excess of 0.79\u00a0kg (OR\u00a0=\u00a07.76, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a05.73\u201310.5).The occurrence of medically indicated preterm birth is positively associated with increased maternal pregravid body weight, older maternal age and extremes of gestational weight gain. Targeted pre- and inter-conception weight management efforts should be particularly encouraged in older mothers.",

Finally, a total of 92 patients in group 1 and 91 patients in group 2 completed the study. In group 1, which was the treatment group, patients having the TVT-O procedure for urodynamic stress incontinence were instructed to use post-operatively oestradiol tablets, 25 micrograms (Vagifem, Novo Nordisk) vaginally, once daily, nocte, for 2 weeks and then twice weekly for 6 months. The patients in group 2 (control group) had the TVT-O procedure only. All patients were reviewed in 2 months and again in 6 months time.There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups concerning pre-operative and post-operative haemoglobin, operative time, hospital stay or return to work. The within group analysis did not show significant differences between pre-operative and post-operative urodynamic data in both groups. Patients treated with vaginal estradiol post-operatively showed a statistically significant reduction in relation to the symptoms of urgency and frequency but not in relation to nocturia and urge incontinence compared to the non-treated group. There is no difference in relation to the efficacy of TVT-O procedure between the groups at 6 months follow-up.It appears that vaginal oestradiol treatment could be offered to postmenopausal patients after a TVT-O procedure having the symptoms of frequency and urgency provided they are aware of the lack of evidence regarding long term benefit.",

     "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a major public health problem for adults over age 55 years costing billions of euros/dollars. Over the last 20 years anti-resorptive drugs were the treatment of choice for osteoporosis and most were derived from the bisphosphonate molecule.In the last 7 years remarkable advances in molecular biology and genetics have led to a detailed understanding of the bone remodeling cycle and as a result new therapeutic targets for treatment emerged.These new compounds have different modes of action depending on their role in the bone remodeling cycle. A major discovery was the important role of RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand) secreted by osteoblasts and responsible for stimulating osteoclastic bone resorption. This led to development of a potent monoclonal antibody that blocks its action. This drug should be available soon as a new treatment for osteoporosis. Other molecular targets in resorption have been identified and several specific antagonists are potential treatments. However, a significant limiting factor for a new anti-resorptive drug is the cost of bringing it to the market because of the huge costs of a fracture trial.Although anti-resorptive agents have been the backbone of osteoporosis treatment they do not rebuild bone architecture and development of anabolic agents is needed. These are likely to evolve from an understanding of the LRP/Wnt signaling pathway. Already an antibody against sclerostin has shown promise in animal studies, and not to forget parathyroid hormone which was the first clinically useful anabolic treatment for osteoporosis.",

This region combines a high proportion of the world's population with rapidly rising diabetes prevalence rates. The increase in diabetes in Asia differs from that reported in other parts of the world: it has developed in a shorter time, in a younger age group, and in people with lower body-mass index (BMI).Studies reported that for the same BMI, Asians have a higher body fat percentage, a prominent abdominal obesity, a higher intramyocellular lipid and/or a higher liver fat content compared to Caucasians. These characteristics may contribute to a higher predisposition to insulin resistance at a lesser degree of obesity than Caucasians. The differences in body composition are more pronounced depending on the region. For the same BMI, among three major ethnic groups in Asia, Asian Indians have the highest body fat, followed by Malay and Chinese.Lower insulin sensitivity is already observed in Asian Indian adolescents with a higher body fat and abdominal obesity compared to Caucasian adolescents. In general, Asian adolescents share the same feature of body composition such as higher body subcutaneous fat, lower appendicular skeletal muscle and lower gynoid fat compared to Caucasian adolescents. This unfavourable body composition may predispose to the development of insulin resistance at later age. Genetics may play a role and the interaction with environmental factors (changes in lifestyle) could increase the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome.",

Only eight relevant studies were identified. Six of these focused on endometrial cancer, one study included early stage cervical and ovarian cancers with other benign conditions, while another paper included cervical and endometrial pre-cancers and only a few malignant conditions.Obesity is generally known to increase the risk of intra- and postoperative complications. However, several studies show that obesity, formerly precluding keyhole surgery, seems now to be an indication for the laparoscopic approach. As compared to laparotomy, laparoscopic surgery has a good postoperative outcome, reduced estimated blood loss (EBL) and pain and in some series an increased lymph node count. Laparoscopy has been shown to be cost effective with a shorter hospital stay and return to normal activity. Survival is reported to be the same with both laparotomy and laparoscopy. The benefits of minimal invasive surgery in gynaecological surgery are starting to be found with robotic surgery.",

The risk of fracture exceeds that of the normal population in both patients with pre-dialysis CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The increasing incidence of CKD, the high mortality rate induced by hip fracture, the decreased quality of life and economic burden of fragility fracture make the renal bone disorders a major problem of public health around the world. Optimizing bone health in CKD patients should be a priority. Bone biopsy is invasive. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, commonly used to screen individuals at risk of fragility fracture in the general population, is not adequate to assess advanced CKD because it does not discriminate fracture status in this population. New non-invasive three-dimensional high-resolution imaging techniques, distinguishing trabecular and cortical bone, appear to be promising in the assessment of bone strength and might improve bone fracture prediction in this population. Therapeutic intervention in the chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBD) should begin early in the course of CKD to maintain serum concentration of biological parameters involved in mineral metabolism in the normal recommended ranges, prevent the development of parathyroid hyperplasia, prevent extra-skeletal calcifications and preserve skeletal health.In this paper, we review studies of mineral and bone disorders in patients with CKD and ESRD, the utility of current techniques to assess bone health and the preventive and therapeutic strategies for managing CKD-MBD.",

     "abstract": "It is widely recognized that bone mineral density (BMD) is one of the best predictors of osteoporotic fractures. Sex hormone status clearly affects bone either directly or indirectly and a longer estrogen exposure appears to be a major determinant of postmenopausal BMD. Accordingly, several studies have led to the hypothesis that BMD might represent a marker of the accumulated lifetime exposure of estrogen and therefore be used as a predictor factor of the risk of other postmenopausal conditions such as breast cancer or cardiovascular diseases (CVD).With regard to the risk of breast cancer, there is evidence that different surrogate markers of lifetime exposure to estrogen are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. Most of these markers are the opposite of those for the risk of fracture. Furthermore, several studies have also reported that women with higher BMD have an increased risk of breast cancer compared to women with lower BMD. On the other hand, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis are at increased risk for acute cardiovascular events and mortality independently of age and cardiovascular risk factors. BMD has been shown to inversely correlate with surrogate markers of CVD including aortic calcifications and atherosclerosis. The underlying mechanisms of such a relationship are not fully understood. Several plausible molecular links are serum lipids, pro-inflammatory cytokines or the RANK/RANK ligand/osteoprotegerin system. Interestingly, all of these factors are modulated by estrogens. It could thus be hypothesized that the intensity of postmenopausal estrogen deficiency could be also the common pathogenic factor between atherosclerosis and osteoporosis.",

Women, however, are more likely to experience PD-related complications that may lead to disability (e.g. depression and medication-associated dyskinesia). Further, there are purported differences in the treatment and treatment outcomes in PD men compared to women. Whether estrogen, other hormonal activity, or whether multiple factors underpin these findings remains unknown. Also unknown is whether estrogen itself may represent a therapeutic option for symptomatic PD treatment. This review summarizes what is known about gender differences in epidemiology, clinical features, treatment outcomes (medical and surgical/deep brain stimulation), and social impact among all available PD studies. We offer expert opinion regarding the shortcomings of the current evidence, and we propose a detailed list of studies that will help to clarify important gender related PD questions.

     "abstract": "Several studies drawn from the Ecuadorian population have previously reported that more than half of mid-aged women present hot flushes, which can impair their quality of life. However up-to-date risk factors for their presence and severity have not been assessed.To assess hot flush frequency and intensity and related risk factors among middle-aged Ecuadorian women.In this cross-sectional study, 1154 healthy women aged 40\u201359 years, visiting healthcare centers of eight main cities of Ecuador with more than 100,000 inhabitants, were assessed with the first item of the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and a questionnaire containing female and partner socio-demographic data.Mean age of the entire sample was 48.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.6 years (median 48), a 48.7% had 12 or less years of schooling, 52.8% were postmenopausal, 43.6% lived at high altitude, 56.8% were married and 10% were on hormonal therapy (HT). Hot flushes accounted for 56% (n\u00a0=\u00a0646) of the whole sample, of which 29.1% and 9.1% were respectively graded as severe and very severe. Logistic regression determined that female sedentarism (OR: 2.42, CI 95% [1.63\u20133.59]), accessing a free healthcare system (OR: 1.96, CI 95% [1.30\u20132.96]), living at high altitude (OR: 1.82, CI 95% [1.14\u20132.90]) and having a partner abusing alcohol (OR: 1.92, CI 95% [1.09\u20133.35]) were significant risk factors related to the presence of hot flushes. The regression model also determined that among women with hot flushes (n\u00a0=\u00a0646), sedentarism (OR: 1.73, CI 95% [1.14\u20132.62]) and having a partner with erectile dysfunction (OR: 2.57, CI 95% [1.44\u20134.59]) were significant risk factors related to severe/very severe hot flushes whereas married status (OR: 0.53, CI 95% [0.32\u20130.86]), living at high altitude (OR: 0.46, CI 95% [0.26\u20130.78]) and partner healthiness (OR: 0.59, CI 95% [0.36\u20130.95]) were not.To the best of our knowledge this is the first and largest study assessing hot flushes in a mid-aged Ecuadorian population. We found that the presence and severity were not significantly related to age and hormonal status yet to other individual female/male characteristics and the demography of the studied population.",

The purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of 5-hydroxytroptophan (5-HTP), the immediate precursor of serotonin, upon menopausal hot flashes. Selective, serotonergic, reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which increase the amount of serotonin in the synaptic gap, have shown some promise in the amelioration of hot flashes.We administered 5-HTP or placebo, in double-blind fashion, to 24 postmenopausal women reporting frequent hot flashes. Treatment outcome was measured using a miniature, electronic, hot flash recorder.No significant effects of 150\u00a0mg/day 5-HTP upon hot flash frequency were found. The 5-HTP group had 23.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.7 (SD) hot flashes/24\u00a0h prior to treatment and 18.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.6 at the end of treatment.

In comparison to estradiol-only therapy, combined HRT leads to enhanced proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. In a quantitative mouse model, we assessed the balance between uterine and undesired mammary gland effects for two progestins that are widely used in HRT, progesterone and medroxyprogesterone acetate.Mice were ovariectomized and after 14 days they were treated subcutaneously with either vehicle, estradiol (100\u00a0ng) or estradiol plus increasing doses of progesterone or medroxyprogesterone acetate for three weeks.Measures for progestogenic mammary gland activity were stimulation of side-branching and stimulation of epithelial cell proliferation. Progestogenic activity in the uterus was assessed by measuring inhibition of estradiol-activated uterine epithelial cell proliferation. ED50 and ID50 values for the distinct readouts were obtained and dissociation factors for uterine versus mammary gland activity were calculated.MPA demonstrated uterine activity and mitogenic activity in the mammary gland at the same doses. In contrast, progesterone showed uterine activity at doses lower than those leading to significant stimulation of epithelial cell proliferation in the mammary gland.Progestins do not behave the same. Use of the natural hormone progesterone, but not MPA, in combined hormone therapy might offer a safety window between uterine effects and undesired proliferative activity in the mammary gland.",

Each age group included 2 subgroups of 10 sedentary and 10 runners, which were compared. The workload was increased at 3\u00a0min intervals from time 0 until exhaustion. Subjects with a low maximal capacity (as established in a preliminary test) pedalled for 3\u20134\u00a0min against no workload at the beginning of the test, so that exercises lasted about 15\u00a0min in all individuals.At exhaustion, heart rate and systolic pressure were significantly higher in sedentary than in trained subjects, whereas V O 2 max , blood glucose and plasma lactate levels were similar in all groups. Exercise induced similar GH responses in younger sedentary and exercise-trained subjects and in older exercise-trained subjects, with mean peak levels 7.5 times higher than baseline. In contrast, in older sedentary women peak GH level was only 4.4 times higher than baseline and was significantly lower than in the other groups.These data suggest that in women prolonged physical training exerts protective effects against age-dependent decline in GH secretion.",

     "abstract": "Within an average observation period of 5\u20136 years, several clinical trials reported an increased risk of breast cancer due to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, it remains disputable, whether the increased rate of breast cancers detected within the given time frame is indeed due to newly induced tumors and thus constitutes HRT-initiated primary breast cancers. Onco-pathologically speaking it appears more likely that HRT stimulates the growth of already existing small tumor nests which \u2013 due to their small size \u2013 would otherwise go undiagnosed. The major arguments are: 1. Cancer research has established that malignant tumors, including breast cancer, need an average of 5\u201310 years to expand from a single malignant cell to a lesion of 5\u201310\u00a0mm diameter. A time period of only 5 years, as covered by the respective studies, may well be too short to permit the detection of tumors primarily induced by HRT. 2. This calculation is a worst-case scenario which can only be accurate if the tumor is a fast growing aggressive lesion without cell loss during its progression. Both characteristics are not true for the HRT-associated breast cancer, on the contrary: in the majority of cases the lesions are well differentiated slowly growing tumors. 3. With regard to the relatively short period of observation one has to assume that the HRT drugs \u2013 a physiological substance in (sub-) physiological doses \u2013 would have to transform a normal breast epithelial cell into a malignant tumor cell in the early phase of treatment. There is no plausible explanation for such immediate effects of steroid hormones. 4. Both the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and Million Women Study (MWS) report that the increase of breast cancer cases starts immediately after the initiation of the HRT. If HRT would really instigate de novo breast cancers, the rise in incidences would be expected to occur much later. Yet, the growth rate rapidly declined after HRT was discontinued. This is also remarkable because the curve of normalization would be expected to decrease over a much longer period of time given the unlimited growth potential of malignant cells.In summary, HRT is hence more likely to be a tumor promoter than a de novo-inducer of breast cancers.",

     "abstract": "Treatment of gynaecological cancer frequently results in the loss of ovarian function and menopausal symptoms. Symptoms of iatrogenic menopause are usually significantly more intense than those of natural menopause due to sudden onset of symptoms, younger age and its effects on common physical and psychological problems of cancer therapy like body image concerns and sexual dysfunction. The most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms is hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, it is very controversial if HRT is safe in patients after a gynaecological malignancy. The main concerns are the potential stimulation of residual cancer and the induction of new hormone-dependent disease. However, the majority of the most common gynaecological malignancies like squamous cell carcinomas of the cervix, serous papillary epithelial ovarian carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas of the vulva are not oestrogen dependent. Furthermore, current scientific evidence does not show HRT to adversely affect the outcome in patients after treatment for hormone sensitive cancers like early stage endometrioid adenocarcinomas of the endometrium. There are only a small number of gynaecological malignancies like low grade endometrial stromal sarcomas in which HRT is an absolute contraindication. Therefore, as maintaining quality of life and minimising the physical and psychological impact of treatment side effects is one of the most important factors in cancer care, it is imperative to give patients unbiased information about their individual cancer which in most cases will allow them to use HRT without any detrimental effect on their survival.",

We explored associations between ever-use of therapies and risks, analysed annual changes of risk, and the impact of therapies on histological subtypes.

Our further results should be interpreted with caution as significances were found in analyses only when smoking and non-smoking women, various hormone regimens, or histological subtypes, respectively, were pooled.Dedicated studies designed to more adequately delineate the role of MHT are necessary to substantiate whether use of MHT is a risk factor for this or other types of lung cancer.",

They have been widely adopted as population health interventions in many jurisdictions and their routine use has been endorsed by the WHO. The development of these vaccines comes after an increased understanding of the natural history and epidemiology of HPV infection and disease in both males and females. Persistent HPV infection with oncogenic types induces malignant transformation in a range of epithelia including the cervix, anogenital regions, the penis and a number of head and neck sites. In relation to HPV disease prevention in the post-reproductive years, most infections occur soon after commencement of sexual activity but new infections do occur throughout the age spectrum. This reduces the likely impact of prophylactic vaccines in this population. The major impact on HPV related disease in this age group will come from advances in screening and early detection of HPV and neoplastic precursors. The most appropriate prevention for any individual man or women in this age group will be an individualised combination of vaccination, screening and early detection depending on the individual's own circumstances.",

It is associated with an increase of cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia and of abdominal and/or selective visceral fat mass deposition. Obesity, a modern day epidemic, is promoted by an obesogenic environment that interacts with the genetic background.

Obesity is also associated with the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. In this review, the main pathophysiologic processes for the increase of obesity in menopause and the possible effects of pre-menopausal obesity regarding the cessation of ovarian function are described. The interactions among the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal and -adrenal (stress system) axes and the environment are explored.

Studies in adults looking at the effect of vitamin D levels on outcomes relating to cardiometabolic disorders were selected. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the risk of developing cardiometabolic disorders comparing the highest and lowest groups of serum 25OHD.From 6130 references we identified 28 studies that met our inclusion criteria, including 99,745 participants. There was moderate variation between the studies in their grouping of 25OHD levels, design and analytical approach. We found that the highest levels of serum 25OHD were associated with a 43% reduction in cardiometabolic disorders [OR 0.57, 95% (CI 0.48\u20130.68)]. Similar levels were observed, irrespective of the individual cardiometabolic outcome evaluated or study design. High levels of vitamin D among middle-age and elderly populations are associated with a substantial decrease in cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. If the relationship proves to be causal, interventions targeting vitamin D deficiency in adult populations could potentially slow the current epidemics of cardiometabolic disorders.",

     "abstract": "Collagen hydrolysates (CH), obtained by an enzymatic hydrolysis process of gelatins, have potential application as oral supplements. Objective: To evaluate the effects of diet supplementation with collagen hydrolysates on bone metabolism markers in postmenopausal women with low bone mineral density. Methods: A randomized double-blind clinical assay with postmenopausal women with osteopenia was planned. The volunteers ingested 10\u00a0g/day of CH or a placebo for a period of 24 weeks. The bone resorption markers (carboxyl-terminal collagen crosslinks\u2014CTX) and bone formation markers (osteocalcin\u2014OSCAL and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase\u2014BAP) were determined at baseline and at 12 and 24 weeks of treatment. Results: The sample consisted of 35 placebo and 36 treated subjects (aged 57.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8 years and BMI of 27.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5\u00a0kg/m2). BAP levels showed no significant changes over the time. CTX levels showed a significant increase during the 24 weeks of treatment from 0.40 to 0.48\u00a0ng/mL in CH group and 0.47 to 0.57\u00a0ng/mL in placebo group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). OSCAL levels also showed a increase during the 24 weeks from 24.8 to 29.0\u00a0ng/mL in CH group and 28.1 to 31.8\u00a0ng/mL in placebo group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A comparison of levels of bone markers between CH and placebo group demonstrated no differences. Analysis of variance revealed no significant effect of dietary supplementation with collagen hydrolysates on biochemical bone markers. Conclusions: CH consumption did not produce any effects on bone metabolism as measured by biochemical indices of bone remodeling in postmenopausal women. The majority of patients exhibited inadequate calcium intake, as well as excess body weight.",

Postmenopausal status may explain in part the cause of acceleration of CVD with aging. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation of menopause and metabolic syndrome independent of aging among Iranian women.On the basis of consecutive recruitment, 940 women between 20 and 76 years old participated in the study. Anthropometric indices, fasting blood glucose, lipid profile were measured, Framingham risk score and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) were calculated for all participants. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) was defined according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. We used IDF definition for metabolic syndrome modified by our recent local data as an alternative measurements.The overall prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 26.4%. Its prevalence was 53.5% in postmenopausal versus 18.3% in premenopausal women. On binary logistic regression analysis, HOMA index, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, family history of diabetes and hypertension had an independent and significant effect on metabolic syndrome. Age-adjusted odds ratio (OR) of postmenopausal status for metabolic syndrome was 2.85 (95%CI: 1.31\u20136.20) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.008).

Although the benefits of exercise training in lowering cardiovascular risk factors are well established, the risks and benefits of hormone therapy have been questioned. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of estrogen therapy (HT) associated or not with exercise training (ET) in autonomic cardiovascular control in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Female rats were divided into: control, OVX, OVX\u00a0+\u00a0HT, OVX\u00a0+\u00a0ET and OVX\u00a0+\u00a0HT\u00a0+\u00a0ET. HT was performed using a 0.25\u00a0mg 8-weeks sustained release pellet. Trained groups were submitted to an 8-week exercise training protocol on treadmill. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was evaluated by heart rate responses to arterial pressure (AP) changes, and vagal and sympathetic tonus by pharmacological blockade. Ovariectomy induced an AP increase (123\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mmHg vs. 108\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mmHg), BRS impairment (\u223c69%), sympathetic activation (\u223c100%) and vagal tonus reduction (\u223c77%) compared to controls. HT or ET normalized the changes in parasympathetic tonus. However, only the association HT\u00a0+\u00a0ET was able to promote normalization of AP, BRS and sympathetic tonus, as compared to controls. These results indicate that ET induces cardiovascular and autonomic benefits in OVX rats under HT, suggesting a positive role of this association in the management of cardiovascular risk factor in postmenopausal women.",

     "abstract": "A proposed missing link between obesity and metabolic disturbances is adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived peptide. Adiponectin is a potent antidiabetic hormone and seems to have a beneficial influence on lipid profile as well. The need to explain the complex physiological roles of this hormone prompted the authors to study the relationship between adiponectin level and obesity \u2013 related abnormalities in a homogenous population of postmenopausal women.The study involved 272 postmenopausal women aged 50\u201360 years. Invitations to participate in the study were sent to 4000 randomly chosen women from the Wroclaw city population fulfilling the age criterion. A telephone questionnaire was administered to the group of 1731 women who responded to the invitation and then subjects for the study were selected. Main outcome measures anthropometrical measurements of body fat tissue content and fat tissue distribution assessment were carried out in all the women. Moreover, serum concentrations of adiponectin, glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin were measured.The most frequent (76%) phenotype among the investigated women was obesity (BMI >25) with abnormal (=\u00a080\u00a0cm) waist circumference (OAW), Obesity with normal (<80\u00a0cm) waist (ONW) and normal weight with abnormal waist (NOAW) were observed in only 5% and 14% of the women, respectively. Non-obese women with normal waist (NONW) were noted in only 5% of the subjects. Serum adiponectin levels in both groups of non-obese women (NOAW and NONW) were significantly higher (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than in the women with obesity or overweight and abnormal waist circumference (OAW group). Adiponectin levels in the women with obesity or overweight and normal waist (ONW) were also higher than in the OAW group; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). In all the women, serum adiponectin level correlated negatively with BMI (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), total fat (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.28, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), android fat deposit (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), waist circumference (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.33, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), glucose (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.27, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), triglycerides (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001), and FIRI (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.34, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and positively with the gynoid/android fat deposit ratio (r\u00a0=\u00a00.28, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and HDL cholesterol (r\u00a0=\u00a00.36, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001).These results confirm that adiponectin could be a marker of the development of menopausal insulin resistance syndrome.",

Sleeplessness (42%) was reported as the main reason for seeking treatment. On average, 54% of women were aware of HRT, despite the fact that most (38%) were unable to mention any associated benefits. Most women had used natural or herbal treatments (37%) for the alleviation of menopausal symptoms. Only 19% had received HRT. 27% of respondents reported having breast discomfort, while 70% reported performing self-breast examinations. 53% of women had never received a mammogram, despite breast cancer concern (50%). 24% of women described HRT as being a risk factor for breast cancer. Most women and their partners reported no reductions in sexual function (66 and 51%, respectively), while 90% of respondents did not seek treatment for reduced sexual function. In the event of sexual dysfunction, 33% of women replied that they would be willing to seek treatment.Many Asian women experience postmenopausal symptoms that are often left untreated (due to the acceptance of menopause as a natural process) or treated with herbal/natural remedies. There was a general lack of knowledge among these women regarding treatment options, HRT, and possible risks associated with HRT. A more concerted effort should be made to better disseminate information regarding the pathogenesis and risk factors associated with breast cancer, menopause, and menopausal symptoms to Asian women.",

We analyzed quartiles of change in time and frequency domain indices of ANS activity and changes in insulin for between and within group differences using ANCOVA and Tukey post hoc tests adjusted for age, ethnicity, randomization group, change in fitness, and change in weight.We observed at baseline that insulin was positively correlated with body anthropometry (body weight, r2\u00a0=\u00a00.34; BMI, r2\u00a0=\u00a00.39; waist circumference, r2\u00a0=\u00a00.29; all, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and inversely associated with rMSSD (r2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.12) and SDNN (r2\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.18; all, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

     "abstract": "The determinants of length of life are multifactorial and involve complex processes, most of which are not as yet understood completely. Tremendous advances have, however, been made in recent times in understanding some of the key molecular mechanisms that influence ageing and lifespan. Herein we highlight many of the more important findings and their potential clinical implications. Most of the intracellular factors involved in the ageing process, such as members of the sirtuin family, as well as insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I and their genes, are part of interconnected pathways. The manipulation of these and other genes in animal models can increase or decrease lifespan. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, some of which involve microRNAs, as well as modifications to chromatin and histones, can influence longevity. A decline in the function of stem cells might also be responsible for some aspects of mammalian ageing. Calorie restriction, polyphenols such as resveratrol, rapamycin, spermidine and angiotensin I converting enzyme inhibitor, are able to increase lifespan by modulation of branches of the longevity pathways. Molecular genetic studies of long-lived subjects have identified several potential candidate genes, but genetic research on ageing is in its infancy. Large genome-wide association studies should provide insights. Although new biomarkers for ageing and health, such as ones that might reveal telomere dysfunction, have been described, advances in the genetics and molecular biology of longevity will require interdisciplinary approaches if the much-hoped for success in alleviating the diseases of ageing, and an extension of both lifespan and healthspan is to be achieved.",

     "abstract": "Taking a life course approach to the study of reproductive health involves the investigation of factors across life and, also across generations, that influence the timing of menarche, fertility, pregnancy outcomes, gynaecological disorders, and age at menopause. It also recognises the important influence of reproductive health on chronic disease risk in later life. Published literature supports the use of an integrated life course approach to study reproductive health, which examines the whole life course, considers the continuity of reproductive health and the interrelationship between the different markers of this. This is in contrast to more traditional approaches that tend to focus only on contemporary risk factors and which consider each marker of reproductive health separately. For instance, we found evidence linking early life factors such as growth, socioeconomic conditions, and parental divorce with ages at menarche and menopause, although the nature of the relationship differs. We discuss the different theoretical models that are used within life course epidemiology and which postulate pathways linking exposures across the life course to health outcomes, using examples of relevance to the study of reproductive health. These highlight the importance of examining timing of exposures, such as during critical periods in early life, and the temporal order of exposures. How life course frameworks of reproductive health can be developed to help identify hypotheses to be tested is also demonstrated. This approach has implications for the development of effective health policy that moves beyond identifying not only the type of intervention but also the most appropriate time across life to intervene.",

Until recently, the influence of cognitive performance on time to death was thought largely to be based on failing cognition in the time immediately before death or because lower mental ability was associated with low socioeconomic status and socioeconomic disadvantage. Children who were systematically IQ tested early in the twentieth century have now completed most of their life expectancy and permit evaluation of a possible link between childhood IQ and survival. This link is discussed as it affects people with intellectual disability and as a possible contributor to the acquisition of a healthy life style or use of health services. Studies on the topic are affected by many methodological pitfalls. Recently, as cohorts IQ tested as adolescents have completed middle age, new relevant data have become available. These suggest that earlier attempts to tease out the confounding effects of socioeconomic status on the relationship between childhood IQ and mortality did not take account of the full effects of childhood adversity on IQ and disease risk. When statistical models that include childhood adversity are tested, these attenuate and sometimes remove the contribution of IQ to morbidity and premature death.",

Beyond the myriad major and minor morbidities linked to obesity, increased all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality is recognized in the obese.

Recently published studies greatly enhance our knowledge about the impact of body fat distribution on relative risks specific to cancer type, and among women, there is further evidence for the role of menopausal status in modifying relative risks. However, the magnitude of all-cause as well as cancer mortality related to excess body weight varies between prospective cohort studies and the strength of the association, in particular in the overweight range, is still a matter of debate. The distribution of total body fat, how we measure it, and the ratio of body fat to fat-free mass explains to some degree the inconsistencies in associated disease risks in the literature. Physical activity, a potential confounder, has been shown to lower the risk of many chronic diseases, independently of the degree of adiposity. A review of the literature provides much support for public health messages that advocate the benefit of change to a more active lifestyle regardless of age and level of excess body fat.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of clinical definitions of the metabolic syndrome is frequently misunderstood. While the metabolic syndrome as a physiological process describes a clustering of numerous age-related metabolic abnormalities that together increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, clinical definitions include obesity which is thought to be a cause rather than a consequence of metabolic disturbance, and several elements that are routinely measured in clinical practice, including high blood pressure, high blood glucose and dyslipidaemia. Obesity is frequently a central player in the development of the metabolic syndrome and should be considered a key component of clinical definitions. Previous clinical definitions have differed in the priority given to obesity. Perhaps more importantly than its role in a clinical definition, however, is obesity in isolation before the hallmarks of metabolic dysfunction that typify the syndrome have developed. This should be treated seriously as an opportunity to prevent the consequences of the global diabetes epidemic now apparent. Clinical definitions were designed to identify a population at high lifetime CVD and type 2 diabetes risk, but in the absence of several major risk factors for each condition, are not optimal risk prediction devices for either. Despite this, the metabolic syndrome has several properties that make it a useful construct, in conjunction with short-term risk prediction algorithms and sound clinical judgement, for the identification of those at high lifetime risk of CVD and diabetes. A recently published consensus definition provides some much needed clarity about what a clinical definition entails. Even this, however, remains a work in progress until more evidence becomes available, particularly in the area of ethnicity-specific waist cut-points.",

The Mediterranean diet, a high-qulaity diet and increased fruit and vegetable consumption were all found to be cardioprotective.The systematically reviewed studies reveal that a high adherence to a Mediterranean type of diet or \u201cprudent diet\u201d is associated with reduced risk of CVD and some types of cancer, even in the elderly. Also dietary intervention strategies can prevent morbidity, premature mortality and improve quality of life in older persons worldwide.",

Current diagnosis is based on clinical criteria and neuropathology. This is not always sufficient, and the development of sensitive and specific biomarkers would enable earlier and more accurate diagnosis. Genetic markers, such as Apolipoprotein E4, and cerebrospinal fluid markers such as \u03b2-amyloid and tau, support a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The latter can also predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Imaging markers improve diagnostic accuracy by reflecting brain function or aspects of in vivo pathological changes. In order for such biomarkers to become clinically useful, however, effective treatments need to become available, and long-term follow-up studies are necessary to evaluate the relevance of cross-sectional biomarker changes for the longitudinal natural history of the disease.",

     "abstract": "Low bone mineral density (BMD) and clinical factors (CRF) have been identified as factors associated with an increased relative risk of fractures. From this observation and for clinical decision making, the concept of prediction of the individual absolute risk of fractures has emerged. It refers to the individual's risk for fractures over a certain time period, e.g. the next 5 and 10 years. Two individualized fracture risk calculation tools that are increasingly used and are available on the web are the FRAX algorithm and the Garvan fracture risk calculator. These tools integrate BMD and CRFs for fracture risk calculation in the individual patient in daily practice. Although both tools include straightforward risk factors, such as age, sex, previous fractures, body weight and BMD, they differ in several aspects, such as the inclusion of other CRFs, fall risks and number of previous fractures. Both models still need to be validated in different populations before they can be generalized to other populations, since the background risk for fractures is population specific. Further studies will be needed to validate their contribution in selecting patients who will achieve fracture risk reduction with anti-osteoporosis therapy.",

     "abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CHD), traditionally considered a male disease, is also a major threat to women. This review article addresses independent risk factors for CHD that are specific for women as well as non-gender-specific risk factors and how their effects differ between men and women.Although polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in women is associated with an adverse metabolic risk profile, current evidence regarding future risk of CHD is conflicting. Preeclampsia is consistently associated with higher risk of CHD later in life. Menopause is associated with an increased risk of CHD, and the earlier the onset of menopause, the larger the risk. Existing data on postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) was inconclusive with regard to possible protection when HT is initiated close to menopause in young peri- or postmenopausal women. Evidence on use of low-dose oral contraceptives strongly suggests no increased risk of CHD.Although levels of physical inactivity are similar for men and women, the higher prevalences of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity in older women portends a greater risk in women than in men. Additionally, risk factors like smoking, hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels have greater impact in women than in men.This review indicates that acknowledgement of non-gender-specific risk factors in addition to those that are unique to women would help optimize diagnosis, treatment and earlier prevention of CHD in women. Further research is needed to ascertain if incorporating these gender-specific risks into a clinically used risk stratification model would change outcome in women.",

Women who experience premature menopause (before age 40 years) or early menopause (between ages 40 and 45 years) experience an increased risk of overall mortality, cardiovascular diseases, neurological diseases, psychiatric diseases, osteoporosis, and other sequelae. The risk of adverse outcomes increases with earlier age at the time of menopause. Some of the adverse outcomes may be prevented by estrogen treatment initiated after the onset of menopause. However, estrogen alone does not prevent all long-term consequences, and other hormonal mechanisms are likely involved.Regardless of the cause, women who experience hormonal menopause and estrogen deficiency before reaching the median age of natural menopause are at increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Estrogen treatment should be considered for these women, but may not eliminate all of the adverse outcomes.",

It is estimated that around three million people are regularly incontinent in the UK with a prevalence of about 40 per 1000 adults. There are various factors which can cause incontinence such as pregnancy, childbirth, obesity, menopause, or just inherent connective-tissue weakness. All of these factors can cause pathophysiology changes in the muscular and fascial structures of the pelvic floor and lead to pelvic support defects and possibly pelvic floor dysfunction. We aim with this review article to highlight predictors or predisposing factors of incontinence; in order to help clinicians during their decisions and put in place a policy of a preventive strategy to decrease the incontinence rate in the general population.",

     "abstract": "Operations for female stress urinary incontinence (SUI) are among the most common operations performed. In particular, recent advances in surgical technique and materials available for this type of surgery have made these operations more accessible, but even if an operation is characterized as \u201cminimally invasive\u201d surgeons must aim to maintain the highest possible standards in the interest of their patients.Great care has to be taken to do a thorough workup of a patient about to undergo surgery. A detailed history and a good clinical evaluation including a clinical stress test is a prerequisite. It is highly recommended to do an urodynamic investigation prior to any surgery which affects bladder storage and micturition in order to confirm the presumptive diagnosis and to exclude patients who should not undergo surgery (e.g. with voiding disorders).Before taking a patient to theatre the surgeon must be clear in him or her mind about which operation to do. In other words preoperative selection of the appropriate type of operation is of the greatest importance. For this reason every surgeon has to be familiar with a certain range of incontinence procedures from which she can choose in a particular instance. There is no doubt that tension-free mid-urethral slings have become the procedures of choice in most cases of stress urinary incontinence. However, there will be cases where other procedures are called for such as traditional colposuspension or fascial slings. It is the responsibility of every surgeon not to use procedures which are outdated or not recommended.To maintain standards in incontinence surgery every surgeon has to familiarize him or herself with the procedure, to learn the procedure, to practice the procedure with the help of experienced peers, and finally to achieve the highest level of competence him or herself. So-called Industry sponsored \u201ctraining centres\u201d can be helpful but there are no shortcut to use all possible resources to learn and practice new surgery.Guidelines have become very important in evaluating new procedures and in categorizing the available evidence. They focus on specific recommendations which we can and should use in our daily practice. Again we still have the responsibility to follow the medical literature closely and to adapt our practice as new evidence becomes available\u2014even before it is incorporated into guidelines.Last but not least we have to follow standards when following up on our patients. As far as possible in the context of the health care system where we practice we should aim to see the patient we have operated on at least once 6\u201312 weeks after surgery. We must also make sure that the patient has access to care in case a problem develops later. And we ourselves must be familiar with the complications and consequences of surgery for stress urinary incontinence and must be able to manage a patient who is not completely satisfied after surgery.",

The results of 10 studies supported the view that women with more negative attitudes towards the menopause report more symptoms during this transition and 3 studies found no significant association between these variables.Women with more negative attitudes towards the menopause in general report more symptoms during the menopausal transition. However, use of standardised culturally sensitive attitude, and specific symptom, measures are recommended in future prospective studies.",
